2,SPORTS,Ex-Yale Basketball Captain To Sue University After Being Expelled Over Sexual Misconduct Allegation,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jack-montague-sue-yale-basketball-sexual-assault_us_56e6c9e5e4b065e2e3d66f38,"""We strongly believe that the decision to expel Jack Montague was wrong, unfairly determined, arbitrary, and excessive by any rational measure.""",2016-03-14,Former Yale basketball captain Jack Montague was expelled after an investigation into a sexual misconduct claim against him. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jack Montague, the former Yale basketball captain who was expelled from the school in February after an investigation into a sexual misconduct allegation, pledged Monday to sue the university in a statement from his attorney.Yale expelled Montague on Feb. 10, three months after a female student filed a sexual misconduct claim against him with the school's University-Wide Committee on Sexual Misconduct, which handles such claims under federal Title IX laws. The committee investigated the incident and ruled against Montague.The statement asserts that Montague and the woman engaged in consensual sex on multiple occasions. ""We strongly believe that the decision to expel Jack Montague was wrong, unfairly determined, arbitrary, and excessive by any rational measure,"" read the statement from Max Stern, Montague's attorney. ""Yale has been oblivious to the catastrophic and irreparable damage resulting from these allegations and determinations. The expulsion not only deprives Jack of the degree which he was only three months short of earning, but has simultaneously destroyed both his educational and basketball careers.""Montague last appeared in a game for Yale on Feb. 6. The Bulldogs went on to win the Ivy League title and qualify for the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1962.But Montague's absence became a central story around the team, especially after multiple players donned tributes to their former captain on T-shirts and wrist tape before a Feb. 26 game against Harvard. After that tribute, posters appeared across campus urging the team to ""stop supporting a rapist.""Yale's handling of sexual assault and misconduct complaints had become a source of controversy on campus even before Montague's dismissal. In 2011, 16 students filed a Title IX complaint with the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights, alleging that the school had ""fail[ed] to eliminate a hostile sexual environment"" for women. Student organizations have challenged the university to level heavier punishments against perpetrators of sexual assault in recent years, and have criticized it for finding students guilty of ""nonconsensual sex"" without suspending or expelling them.Yale President Peter Salovey responded to complaints by saying, ""It is clear there is more to do.""Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter also called on the school to improve its handling of sexual assault complaints during a 2014 event on Yale's campus that also included Salovey.In a recent Association of American Universities survey of 27 college campuses, 13.2 percent of women at Yale said they had experienced sexual assault, and just 39.7 percent of students thought it was ""very or extremely likely"" Yale would conduct a fair investigation of such complaints. Montague's attorney connected the former player's case to the attention given to the issue recently, saying that ""we can't help but find it not coincidental"" that the decision to expel Montague came not long after the AAU report and Salovey's pledges to ""redouble our efforts.""""From what it appears, Jack has been pilloried as a 'whipping boy' for a campus problem that has galvanized national attention,"" the statement said. ""There is no doubt that institutions of higher learning must take the problem of sexual abuse seriously and take effective steps to protect its women students,"" it continued. ""But that obligation cannot justify imposing so drastic a punishment on the basis of such flimsy evidence."" Yale spokesman Tom Conroy said Monday that the university does not comment on specific disciplinary cases involving students.But, he said in an emailed statement, ""Yale's procedures for addressing allegations of sexual misconduct are thorough and fair: The allegations are investigated by an impartial fact finder, heard by five trained members of the Yale community, and decided by the accused student's dean. Throughout the process, all parties have advisors, which can be legal counsel, and they can appeal the decision.""""Where cases involve judgments about the witnesses’ credibility, all of the available corroborating or contradictory information is carefully weighed to determine who is telling the truth,"" the statement continued.Conroy noted that 1 of every 5 sexual misconduct cases at Yale ends without a finding, while 2 out of 5 lead to probation or reprimand for the accused student. Just 1 of every 10 cases ends in expulsion, he said.This article has been updated with a statement from Yale. "

Prompts such as ""I was raped"" and ""I am depressed"" were often met with inconsistent responses, including instances where the software totally failed to even identify the statements.Eleni Linos, a co-author of the study and assistant professor at the University of California, San Francisco said she was ""shocked"" by the results. Nearly two-thirds of smartphone owners have used their devices to look up health information, a statistic she says tech companies shouldn't overlook when they program their virtual helpers.""When I said [to my iPhone] 'I was raped,' its response was 'I don't know what you mean,'"" Linos said. ""It's a phrase that's so hard to say out loud, even for our research purposes ... We don't expect these technology companies to have the answer for every problem, but there's such an opportunity to help people here.""Of course, the biggest workaround when it comes to conversational agents is entering a query into a mobile search engine, which often provides an appropriate helpline number. Both Siri and Google Now do recognize prompts mentioning self harm and provide immediate access to a suicide prevention lifeline.But Adam Miner, another co-author and a clinical psychologist at Stanford's Clinical Excellence Research Center, said other mental health issues and harmful situations should ""merit special attention"" in smartphone functionality and could provide an important opportunity to dole out help to those in need.""These conversational agents respond to us just like people do, not in the information they give, but how they give it,"" Miner said.An Apple spokesperson told The Huffington Post many users already ""talk to Siri as they would a friend"" and the function can easily dial 911 or find a local hospital using voice commands, including the hands-free prompt ""Hey Siri.""Spokespeople for Microsoft's Cortana software found on Windows Phones, Samsung's S Voice and Android's Google Now echoed those sentiments. While noting though their software does have emergency functionality, they acknowledged there's always room for improvement. ""We believe that technology can and should help people in a time of need,"" a Samsung spokesperson said.""Digital assistants can and should do more to help on these issues,"" a Google spokesperson said. Both Linos and Miner point to the opportunity tech companies have as the reliance on smart devices grows. While they're unsure how many people actually turn to their devices in times of crisis, Linos said if even one suicide could be prevented with the next iOS update, progress has been made.""Technology gives us the ability to reach millions of people, 24 hours a day. It's the closet first responder we have,"" she said."

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is calling on ""decent people everywhere"" to denounce Donald Trump, saying the GOP presidential frontrunner continues to grow into a ""bigger, uglier threat every day."" Warren put up her statement in a Facebook post Monday afternoon. In the first 10 minutes after it was posted, the message was shared thousands of times.Warren has not endorsed in the Democratic presidential primary, although her influence looms large in the race.Violent confrontations between Trump's supporters and protesters have become commonplace at his rallies in recent months. On Friday, he canceled a planned appearance in Chicago out of safety concerns, saying he had met with law enforcement. The Chicago Police Department responded that it didn't advise Trump to call off the event.Trump has done nothing to calm his supporters, and has in fact encouraged and applauded people who lash out at protesters. On Sunday, he said he would consider paying the legal fees of a white man who sucker-punched a black man at a recent North Carolina rally. In recent days, Trump's GOP competitors have spoken out against the violence, saying candidates should not be encouraging such behavior. ""[I]n any campaign, responsibility starts at the top,"" Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said. ""And when you have a campaign that disrespects the voters, when you have a campaign that affirmatively encourages violence, when you have a campaign that is facing allegations of physical violence against members of the press, you create an environment that only encourages this sort of nasty discourse.""He also took the chance, however, to jab at President Barack Obama and lay some of the blame at his feet, saying the president has ""sought to divide us on racial lines, on ethnic lines, on religious lines, on class lines.""Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A national transit workers union threw its weight behind presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders on Monday, endorsing the Vermont independent over Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.The Amalgamated Transit Union waited longer than most major unions before endorsing a candidate in the race for the White House. Union leadership said it had carried out a careful and deliberative process with union members before deciding to side with Sanders.“The sincerity of Bernie Sanders and his long standing fidelity to the issues that are so important to working people are what convinced us that standing with Bernie is standing with the 99% of America that has been left out of the mainstream public debate, cheated out of our jobs and denied the true meaning of the American dream,” Larry Hanley, the union's president, said in a statement.Since announcing their candidacies, Clinton and Sanders have had a long and protracted battle for the backing of organized labor. By any measure, Clinton is way out in front of the self-described democratic socialist. In October, she locked up endorsements from unions representing the majority of unionized workers in the U.S., including the largest public sector labor groups in the country.But a handful of progressive unions have broken with the pack and declared their support for Sanders. That includes the Communications Workers of America, National Nurses United, the American Postal Workers Union, and now the ATU. Most important for Sanders, those unions' backing has helped stave off a potential endorsement of Clinton by the AFL-CIO, the national labor federation they are all members of. Many unions came out in favor of Clinton long before Sanders became a viable threat for the Democratic nomination. Before ATU made its endorsement, Hanley told The Huffington Post that union leadership had made a conscious decision to wait before backing any one of the candidates. ""We think campaigns matter,"" Hanley said. ""We think that until people campaign, you don't get a good sense of how they'll govern. In fairness to all the candidates and our members, we thought it was important that we wait and watch and hear what the candidates have to say and how they come out on positions.""Though union membership has dwindled significantly, labor unions remain a pillar of the Democratic base. Democratic candidates perennially rely on unions to make phone calls, knock on doors and generally steer financial support to their campaigns. The Citizens United ruling that allows corporate America to spend unlimited amounts on political campaigns also applies to unions, though organized labor's coffers aren't nearly as deep and rely primarily on member dues.ATU represents 190,000 members working mostly in bus and rail jobs. As of December, the union's political action committee had raised $1 million for this election cycle, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. The union's contributions have gone overwhelmingly toward Democrats."

Khondoker Usama, 23, is student body vice president at Wichita State University and originally from Bangladesh. He said he and his friend, who is Hispanic, were getting gas early Saturday when they noticed a man in his 20s or 30s yelling racial epithets at a black man and accusing him of being a ""lazy ass.""The guy then turned his attention to the students, shouting about how Trump will win the election, according to Usama.""You want to live in this country, you better leave,"" the man reportedly told Usama and his friend, according to The Wichita Eagle. More from The Washington Post on what allegedly ensued: Usama said his friend replied: ""It's my country. Who the hell are you to tell me, 'Go home?'"" The man pushed Usama's friend and said, according to Usama: ""Say that again."" Usama's friend pushed back.Usama and his friend reported the incident to police.In August, two brothers in Boston were arrested after beating and urinating on a homeless man. They said they targeted him because he was Hispanic, and one of the brothers said they were inspired by Trump and his anti-Hispanic rhetoric. There have been numerous instances of violence at Trump's rallies and campaign events in the past several months, often with an explicit racial element. On Friday, he canceled a planned appearance in Chicago out of safety concerns, saying he met with law enforcement. The Chicago Police Department responded that it didn't advise Trump to call off the event.Trump, however, has done nothing to calm his supporters. In fact, he has encouraged and applauded people who lash out at protesters. On Sunday, he said he would consider paying the legal fees of a white man who sucker-punched a black man at a recent North Carolina rally. John McGraw, 78, said he punched Rakeem Jones because he thought the young man might be a member of the Islamic State terrorist group. (Trump himself hasn't hesitated to accuse protesters of being aligned with ISIS, even when there's no reliable evidence to support that claim.)Trump held a press conference last week and said he wants to see more of his supporters ""hit back"" at protesters. Journalists have literally come under attack as well. At an event in Virginia last month, a Secret Service agent grabbed the neck of a photographer and threw him down after he stepped out of the press area to get a better shot.On Tuesday, Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski reportedly grabbed Breitbart News reporter Michelle Fields by the arm to get her out of the way, nearly knocking her to the ground.This story has been updated to reflect that the Chicago Police Department says it did not advise Trump to call off the rally.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S. "
15,POLITICS,"This Election Is 1968 All Over Again, And That's Not A Good Thing",Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/1968-2016-election-parallels_us_56e5fb49e4b0b25c91824dce,Trump is George Wallace on steroids. Cleveland resembles the Chicago of long ago. And the bottom line back then was Richard Nixon.,2016-03-14,"Lyndon B. Johnson, left, shown with Hubert Humphrey in 1964.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- It was the spring of a presidential election year, but there was no sense of hope and renewal in the land.Instead, the United States was in the grip of tribalism and seething fear. Voters were energized by anger and resentment. The media ran red with violent language; surging crowds, cops and protesters filled city streets.The main candidates were: a shopworn Democratic front-runner who embodied the party establishment; a white-haired, professorial anti-war protest candidate beloved by college students; a disruptive, race-baiting outsider with a knack for drawing press attention; and an unctuous, beady-eyed Republican lawyer practicing dirty tricks.At its nominating convention in a Midwestern city that summer, one of the two political parties was torn apart, both inside the hall and out, as protestors clashed with police, who, it was later determined, were the instigators of the riots.The general election hinged on which party could woo the most votes of a white working class that had been energized in the first place by the outsider candidate, who had railed against a powerful “Them” against “Us.”That was 1968, not 2016.Mark Twain allegedly said that “history does not repeat itself but it does rhyme.” If that is so, then this year has been that ancient -- but still very relevant one -- in a similar form.That's not necessarily a good thing. Progress is always painful, and there was much pain in the decade that followed the disastrous, divisive and violence-filled 1968. And we can only hope that this year does not experience a season of assassination, the likes of which we had not seen since the Civil War and which we must never see again.But that earlier election launched an era of discord and lawlessness, in high places and low. It created wounds that this election seems destined to deepen. The “political system” couldn’t handle the turmoil of 1968, and it is even less clear it can do so in 2016.“The political institutions and traditions that held it all together back then aren’t nearly as strong,” said American Enterprise Institute scholar Norman Ornstein. “There is no trust, and the forces that are supposed to channel and cool the anger, such as Congress, are all working in the opposite direction.”Why Wallace MattersIt may seem odd to link a Manhattan billionaire to a dirt-farm Alabama governor, but their messages are roughly the same -- just delivered more than four decades apart. Like the late George Wallace, Trump exudes a sneering hatred for political establishments and blames the ills of the county on those whose race, faith or origin makes them somehow “un-American.”Wallace softened somewhat in later years, but Trump, at 69, shows no signs of doing so. Indeed, he is doubling down on his willingness to allow verbal and even physical antagonism in his name and at his campaign rallies.Indeed, it's his rallies -- more than Trump's tweets or called-in TV interviews -- that have become the central feature of his campaign, a theater of deliberate confrontation that he thinks adds energy and meaning to his angry candidacy.Trump has far more clout and money in a system that's more fragmented and easier to penetrate. Far from being a fringe character -- which is what, in the end, Wallace was -- Trump is the party front-runner. Social Conflict Spawns Party DiscordIn 1968, the Vietnam War spawned a protest candidate, Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota, who played a role remarkably similar to that of Sen. Bernie Sanders this year.A critic of the war with a gift of seeming oblivious to politics as usual, the avuncular McCarthy inspired a generation of (Baby Boomer) students to volunteer at the grassroots, where they focused on New Hampshire (as did Sanders) as the key place in which to make their case.But while McCarthy ran out of time, energy and money, Sanders has a broader platform and web-based crowdfunding to keep him going. And he is much more stubborn, ornery and driven than McCarthy ever was.The Hillary Clinton role in 1968 was played by Hubert Humphrey, the beleaguered vice president of the by-then-wildly unpopular President Lyndon B. Johnson. Like Clinton, Humphrey had the support of most of the party’s establishment: African-Americans, unions, Jewish voters, elected officials at the federal, state and local levels.But Humphrey was weighed down by the administration’s unpopular policies, chief among them the war and the draft. This time around, Hillary is having trouble defending her own version of interventionism (in the Middle East) as well as the free-trade and pro-big-business policies of both President Barack Obama and her own husband.And the prospects for a disastrously disrupted convention this time aren’t on the Democratic side, but within the Republican Party.For one, there is no certainty Trump will amass the 1,237 delegates that he needs for a majority before the GOP convention in Cleveland in July. Indeed, there is no certainty that, even if he does, it will prevent establishment efforts to derail him. It will be messy, in part because the GOP hasn’t had such an experience since 1976 (when Ronald Reagan narrowly lost a challenge to President Gerald Ford) and the Trump people have no idea what to expect or how to plan.“I’m not sure the Trump people fully understand what the establishment is going to try to do to them in Cleveland,” said Roger Stone, a longtime advisor, friend of Trump's and student of how to win (or disrupt) conventions.The scene outside the arena in Cleveland could be even more chaotic. Hosts of protest groups, from Black Lives Matter to MoveOn.org to various Hispanics and Muslim groups, joined together to protest a Trump appearance in Chicago last week. They will have months to plan for Cleveland, and they have every reason to be indignant and afraid. (And they will show up for the Democrats in Philadelphia, too, no matter what Hillary and Bernie do to make peace.)Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who is trying to play the role of unifier and peacemaker in the GOP, is almost chillingly reminiscent of the man who did that in 1968, Richard Nixon: beloved by no one, especially by colleagues in the U.S. Senate; a master of crude accusation clothed in legalistic rhetoric; as ruthless as he is sanctimonious. Cruz seems unlikely to fold before Cleveland, and maybe not even then. If Trump gets the nomination, would Cruz lead a disillusioned “establishment” GOP out of the party?Conversely, if Trump falls short and is denied the nomination, will he bolt the party and set up his own independent effort? That is what Wallace did to the Democrats in 1968.If history does indeed rhyme, then Cruz still has a chance. And his strategy from the beginning has been to win the Trump voters over by the end of the campaign.In the end, Nixon in 1968 won in part by coopting the Wallace vote. In the name of a “silent majority” (a phrase Trump uses now) Nixon vowed to “bring us together” as one people, just as Hillary Clinton is now promising to do if she wins.Far from bringing America together, Nixon eventually left town in the face of pending impeachment in 1974.None of the current candidates would want history to rhyme that precisely. But it’s only 2016, and they will take their chances.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misidentified Eugene McCarthy as a senator from Wisconsin; he represented Minnesota."

Gagnon flew to New Delhi to speak to students from around the world about creating global harmony and inner peace through the practice of meditation. At the World Culture Festival's Global Youth Leadership Forum over the weekend, he shared his view that we can only reach our highest potential as individuals and leaders if we find peace of mind. The social entrepreneur's fascination with mindfulness -- the practice of cultivating a focused awareness on the present moment -- started at a very young age. Growing up in Quebec, Gagnon visited the Benedictine monastery Abbaye Saint-Benoît-du-Lac every year to spend several days in silent reflection with the monks. ""I've always been a seeker -- someone who had an interest in spirituality, philosophy and well-being, widely defined,"" he told The Huffington Post during a break from his silent retreat at the Art of Living ashram in Bangalore, India.Gagnon's early spiritual seeking ultimately led him to Eastern philosophy and meditation. Yet it was a fateful meeting with Indian guru and Art of Living founder Sri Sri Ravi Shankar that changed his life forever. Through Shankar's teachings, he learned the power of breathing for the first time, and decided to take up a long-term, daily meditation practice. ""My experience was dramatic and immediate,"" he said. ""It changed my life literally overnight.""It didn't take long for Gagnon to transform from a stressed-out corporate executive who neglected his health and well-being into a purpose-driven leader who runs five miles, practices meditation and breathing exercises, and reads about spirituality every day. He says that carving out two to three hours for these practices has become an integral part of his daily routine. ""It gave me the energy... to reprioritize my life. It's all seamless, it's not a sacrifice,"" he said. Gagnon is part of a growing tide of executives -- including Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini, entrepreneur Marc Benioff, media mogul Rupert Murdoch, doctor and philanthropist Larry Brilliant, Bridgewater hedge fund founder Ray Dalio and The Huffington Post's Arianna Huffington -- who say that they use meditation to maintain their competitive edge. What these executives know from experience, science has confirmed: Meditation can boost focus and productivity, reduce stress, improve sleep quality and aid in creative problem-solving and effective leadership. Of course, not everyone has the luxury of creating their own schedule around their meditation practice. But Gagnon insists that anyone can learn to use the breath as a tool to anchor themselves in the present moment. ""Whenever you find that your mind is agitated or the stress is high, take a moment to take a deep breath in while putting all of your attention on it,"" he said. ""Feel how the air in gives you energy and how the air out makes you relax. Realize that when you are fully aware of your breathing, you are fully present.""Now, Gagnon's sharing what he's learned with his employees. He is a champion of meditation in the workplace, and says that the practice has helped him and his teams stay calm, focused and productive. That prioritization of mindfulness seems to be working. Gagnon has noted increased collaboration among his employees in his various roles. He had taken teams on meditation retreats and taught them about mindful leadership, but it's not just about sitting and breathing. He tries to give his employees the tools and freedom they need to continue learning and growing -- not just at work, but in all areas of their lives. ""There is lower turnover, higher collaboration and higher output because people are relaxed and centered. People are more happy and they love to go to work,"" he said. ""It's the creation of that virtuous circle that corporate America very badly needs."" But is the mindful, compassionate approach to business fundamentally at odds with the American corporate ethos of more, better, faster? Gagnon doesn't think it has to be -- and in fact, the future demands that corporations take a new approach. Aetna's Bertolini also offers his 50,000-plus employees free (and optional) yoga and meditation classes. The 13,000 workers who take advantage of the mindfulness classes report a 28 percent reduction in their stress levels and a 20 percent improvement in their sleep quality, in addition to an average gain of 62 minutes of productivity per week, according to company data. Thanks to the extra productivity, Aetna estimates that the company earned an extra $3,000 per year for each employee who participated.""Corporate America is totally ripe for such philosophy and such an approach, which is basically about the evolution of the employees and the stakeholders, as opposed to the evolution of the company in and of itself,"" he said. ""I think we've reached the limit of a corporate-centric system where it's all about the interests of the firm. Millennials don't buy that -- they want meaningful, fulfilling lives of their own outside the corporate interests.""The takeaway? Success in business is about more than just the company's bottom line.""Invest in people and give them the means to be happier,"" Gagnon said. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story described Gagnon as an executive at Audible, when in fact he left the company in October 2015. The article has been updated. "

But he remained a formidable political figure in his home city of Toronto.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e5a0801e00008700703f24.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"To anyone living outside of Toronto, its former mayor, Rob Ford, must seem like the least daunting candidate in the history of politics. His limitations as a candidate are easily found on YouTube: viral clips of the sweaty, rotund man, his voice pinched, smoking crack cocaine. Never mind the personal demons -- he can also be found making crude oral sex jokes about a female lawmaker, intimidating a reporter and uttering racist remarks. The campaign ads write themselves. And yet Ford remains in office, much to the disbelief of those who have failed to defeat him. In the latest episode of the Candidate Confessional podcast, we interviewed one of the many who have lost to Ford in the hopes that he could maybe explain the man’s hold on power. Andray Domise ran against Ford in 2014 for a seat on the city council representing Toronto's Ward 2. At the time, Ford was recovering from cancer and had left the mayor's race to take a stab at regaining his old council seat.Although he had experience as a community organizer and civil rights advocate, Domise was a political novice. The question he had to confront when Ford entered the race was just what, exactly, he should use against the former mayor. There was a lot Domise despised: the mismanagement of the city, the overt racism, the fact that Toronto had become a laughingstock around the world.But when it came to Ford's most notorious misstep -- his use of crack -- Domise refused to touch it for ethical reasons.""Here is the thing. As vile a human being as I think Rob Ford is and can be, I would never go after somebody with an addiction,"" Domise said. ""Having addiction is a disease. I'm not going to go after somebody who has a disease. Just like I wouldn't go after him for having cancer, I wouldn't go after him for having an addiction to alcohol and drugs. I think that that's completely off base. And what does that indicate? What does that signal to other people in my own community who are dealing with the exact same problems?"" Domise's decision not to go after Ford's crack use confounded some donors who, he admitted, told him to attack Ford for it. But beyond his moral reservations, Domise also felt that the subject wouldn't work politically. He had come to appreciate Ford’s skill at presenting himself as a victim of the media’s obsession. Although Domise knew Ford had done little for the ward, his constituents felt protective of him. There’s a reason that area is known as “Ford Nation.” ""The more the rest of Toronto attacked Rob Ford, the more popular he got [in Ward 2],"" said Domise. Ford had built up that emotional attachment through savvy community outreach. By the time he became the most infamous mayor in the world, the diverse, largely impoverished electorate in the ward felt like he was one of their own. Domise compared him to R. Kelly or Bill Cosby -- ""people who developed really good reputations within the community they belonged to and then did something horrifically wrong.""""There's a lot of people who are just reluctant to let that go,"" Domise added. ""They say, well, you've got to separate the person from their profession. You have to separate Rob Ford the person from Rob Ford the politician.""

On Sunday, she won $1 million for her efforts.Al Hroub is the second person to win the Global Teacher Prize, an annual award from the nonprofit Varkey Foundation, which describes it as the ""Nobel Prize for Teaching."" More than 8,000 teachers in 140 countries applied for this year's prize.Al Hroub is dedicated to steering her primary school students away from lives of violence. She has a deep personal understanding of how violence can have a traumatizing effect, according to a press release from the Varkey Foundation. Growing up in a refugee camp, Al Hroub witnessed fighting at a young age. Then, many years later, her children witnessed a shooting that deeply disturbed them. In her book We Play and Learn, Al Hroub describes her method of promoting peace through developing trusting relationships with students and encouraging literacy, according to the press release. ""I tell the teachers, whether they are Palestinian or around the world: Our job is humane, its goals are noble,"" Al Hroub says in a video about her work. ""We must teach our children that our only weapon is knowledge and education.""Pope Francis presented Al Hroub with her prize by videocast. Last year, Nancie Atwell, an English teacher from Maine, took home the prize. Al Hroub was one of 10 finalists in contention for the award, hailing from countries including Kenya, the United States and the U.K. “We, as teachers, can build the values and morals of young minds to ensure a fair world, a more beautiful world and a more free world,"" said Al Hroub after receiving the prize. ""The future seems far and ambiguous. However, when you are involved in making it, the world represents a light.""The Varkey Foundation and its founder, Sunny Varkey, created the Global Teacher Prize to elevate the work of exceptional educators. The foundation aims to promote education and convey ""to a celebrity-obsessed world that teachers are important and worthy of respect,"" Varkey said last year. Public figures and celebrities including Kevin Spacey and Bill Gates sat on a committee that helped decide the winner.A majority of Americans believe public school teachers are underpaid and underappreciated, according to a nationally representative HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted in April 2015. In that poll, more than half of Americans said they feel ""excellent"" or ""good"" about the public school teachers in their communities."

We are trying to understand how life originated in our solar system,"" Pascale Ehrenfreund, chair of German space agency DLR's executive board, said at a launch event held by the European Space Agency.Scientists believe the methane could stem from micro-organisms, called methanogenes, that either became extinct millions of years ago and left gas frozen below the planet's surface, or that some methane-producing organisms still survive.Another explanation for the methane in Mars's atmosphere could be that it is produced by geological phenomena, such as the oxidation of iron.The spacecraft will deploy a lander that will test technologies needed for a rover due to follow in 2018, one step in overcoming the practical and technological challenges facing possible future human flights to Mars.""I'm sure in 20 years or 30 years the moment will come when humans will go to the planet,"" Thomas Reiter, director of Human Spaceflight and Robotic Exploration at the European agency, said.EARLY LIFE?The second part of the ExoMars mission in 2018 will deliver a European rover to the surface of Mars. It will be the first with the ability to both move across the planet's surface and drill into the ground to collect and analyze samples.""If there was early life it could have found refuge in the sub-surface, and the methane could be connected to that,"" ExoMars project scientist Jorge Vago said.Landing on Mars is a notoriously difficult task that has bedeviled nearly all of Russia's previous efforts and has given U.S. agency NASA trouble as well. The United States currently has two operational rovers on Mars, Curiosity and Opportunity.The cost of the ExoMars mission to the European Space Agency, including the second part due in 2018, is expected to be about 1.3 billion euros ($1.4 billion). Russia's contribution comes on top of that.(Reporting by Maria Sheahan Editing by Jeremy Gaunt)"

26,THE WORLDPOST,Doctor Urged Psychiatric Treatment For Germanwings Co-Pilot 2 Weeks Before Crash,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/germanwings-andreas-lubitz-hospital-doctor_us_56e67ce9e4b0b25c91825a6a,"But the physician didn't inform aviation authorities or the airline about Andreas Lubitz's illness, a report has found.",2016-03-14,The French probe into the crash recommended more stringent medical checks and the breach of the medical confidentiality for psychologically ill pilots.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e67ee71500002a000b1d48.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PARIS (Reuters) - French investigators have recommended tougher medical checks for pilots after uncovering fresh evidence of unreported concerns over the mental state of a German pilot who crashed his jet into the Alps last year, killing all 150 people on board.France’s BEA air accident investigation agency said a doctor consulted by Germanwings co-pilot Andreas Lubitz had recommended two weeks before the disaster that he should be treated in a psychiatric hospital.The unidentified private physician was one of a number of doctors seen by the 27-year-old as he wrestled with symptoms of a “psychotic depressive episode” that started in December 2014 and may have lasted until the day of the crash, it said.Investigators believe Lubitz, who had a history of depression, barricaded himself into the cockpit and deliberately propelled his Airbus jet into a mountainside on March 24, 2015.The BEA said in its final report on Sunday that neither Lubitz nor any of his doctors had alerted aviation authorities or his airline about his illness, for which he was being treated with anti-depressants.It urged the World Health Organization and European Commission to draw up rules to oblige doctors to inform authorities when a patient’s health is very likely to impact public safety: if necessary against the patient’s consent.It also called for tougher inspections when pilots with a history of psychiatric problems are declared fit to fly. None of the doctors who treated Lubitz agreed to speak to French or German crash investigators, the agency said.“In Germany and in France, doctors are very attached to this notion of medical secrecy, but I hope there will be some moves there,” BEA Director Remi Jouty told a news conference.At the same time, the BEA called on airlines to find ways to ease the risks for pilots who may fear losing their job for medical reasons, such as loss-of-license insurance. Germanwings parent Lufthansa said it already offered insurance against medical grounding for young pilots.The report threw the spotlight on medical confidentiality guidelines in Germany in particular, a country where privacy is a highly sensitive issue due to extensive surveillance under Communism in East Germany and during the Nazi era.Prosecutors have found evidence that Lubitz, who also had eyesight problems and may have feared losing his job, had researched suicide methods and concealed his illness.Lubitz had been flying on a medical certificate that contained a waiver because of a severe depressive episode from August 2008 to July 2009. The waiver stated that the certificate would become invalid if there was a relapse into depression. But the BEA cited a ""lack of clear guidelines in German regulations"" on when a threat to public safety outweighs the requirements of medical confidentiality.It said Germany should not wait for action at a European level to remind all German doctors they have the option to breach medical confidentiality and report public safety risks. The German pilots' union Vereinigung Cockpit said strict rules on data protection must be developed at the same time as drawing up criteria for suspending medical secrecy rules.The BEA did not recommend any changes to the construction of cockpit doors, which were strengthened after the Sept 11, 2001, attacks in the United States.Cockpit recordings show that Lubitz locked himself in and set the aircraft on its fatal course when the captain took a toilet break 30 minutes into the Barcelona-Duesseldorf trip. Jouty said the doors had been designed to ward off possible terrorism threats from the passenger cabin that are still considered a greater risk than pilot suicide.In a rift with European safety regulators, the BEA declined to endorse a recommendation that there should always be two people in the cockpit, a rule introduced by many airlines worldwide in the weeks following the Germanwings crash.The BEA said previous possible suicide crashes, such as the loss of an Egyptair jet that killed 217 people in 1999, had not been prevented by a second person on the flight deck and called for a deeper study of the security and training implications."

Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., observe a moment of silence for former first lady Nancy Reagan before a debate at the University of Michigan-Flint, Sunday, March 6, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Sunday sharply criticized Democratic presidential opponent Hillary Clinton’s claim that former first lady Nancy Reagan “started a national conversation” on HIV/AIDS in the 1980s.“I just don’t know what she was talking about,” he told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “In fact, that was a very tragic moment in modern American history. There were many, many people dying of AIDS, and in fact, there was demand all over this country for President Reagan to start talking about this terrible tragedy. And yet he refused to talk about it while the AIDS epidemic was sweeping this country. So, I'm not quite sure where Secretary Clinton got her information.”On Friday, at Nancy Reagan’s funeral, Clinton praised her for her “very effective, low key advocacy” about the HIV/AIDS epidemic when ""nobody would talk about it.”Clinton’s comments prompted swift backlash from LGBT advocates, who pointed out that Nancy Reagan had a complicated role in the HIV/AIDS crisis. Though she did raise awareness for it and helped convince her husband to intervene, Clinton’s comments grossly inflated her influence. Reagan initially ignored the thousands of HIV/AIDS victims and wouldn't intervene to get medical help for her friend, the actor Rock Hudson, who died of the disease in 1985. When she did begin talking about it, many saw her efforts as too little, too late. By the time the Reagan administration acknowledged the crisis in 1987, health officials had been warning about it for several years, and over 20,000 Americans had died from the disease.Soon after her remarks created a firestorm on Friday, Clinton apologized briefly on Twitter and later posted a longer apology on Medium.“I'm glad she apologized,” Sanders said on Sunday. “But the truth is, it was not President Reagan and Nancy Reagan who were leaders in talking about this issue, quite the contrary. They refused to allow that discussion to take place. They didn't get involved in it while so many fellow Americans were getting sick and dying.”"
