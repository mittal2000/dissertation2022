0,POLITICS,Americans Don't Really Trust Any Of The Candidates In An International Crisis,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/foreign-policy-terrorism-poll_us_56f5a382e4b0a3721819fc67,Republicans and Democrats also hold vastly different views on America's foreign policy priorities.,2016-03-25,"Americans aren't confident any of these men could lead during an international crisis -- but they're not totally sure about Hillary Clinton, either.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f5a5711e0000950071164a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Americans are worried about the state of the world and uneasy about the presidential candidates' ability to handle international crises, according to a HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted in the aftermath of Tuesday's terror attacks in Brussels.Sixty-nine percent say they're at least somewhat scared about the way things are going in the world today. There's little consensus, though about what the U.S. should do in response.Almost as many said the best way to ensure peace was through military strength (39 percent) as said it was good diplomacy (43 percent). Thirty-one percent think the U.S. does too much to help solve world problems, while 26 percent think it does too little. Thirty-one percent think the country uses military force too often, while 24 percent think it does so too rarely.Republicans are more than three times likelier than Democrats to value military strength over diplomatic strength, and nearly four times as likely to say the U.S. military isn't strong enough. They're also substantially more likely to oppose an isolationist foreign policy. On most measures, independents fall solidly in the middle. Donald Trump's nativist sentiments appear to best position him to capitalize on those renewed fears in the Republican primary. By a narrow margin, the Republicans surveyed see him as the best primary candidate to deal with an international crisis. Thirty-seven percent of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say they trust him most, with 33 percent naming Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and just 16 percent preferring Ohio Gov. John Kasich.Republicans who place the most faith in Trump differ notably in a few ways from those who don't. They're 13 points likelier to say they're ""very scared"" about the world. They're also 25 points likelier to say that the next president should speak bluntly about Islamic extremism, even if it means criticizing Islam as a whole, and 27 points likelier to say it's a problem that politicians aren't critical enough toward Islam.It's less clear how well Trump's appeal will translate outside of the GOP, where anti-Islam sentiment is less widespread. A 55 percent majority of independents and Democrats, compared to just a quarter of Republicans, say the next president should be careful not to criticize Islam as a whole when speaking about Islamic extremists.When polled about individual candidates, 62 percent of Americans as a whole said they're uneasy about Trump's ability to deal wisely with an international crisis. In contrast, 51 percent are uneasy about Hillary Clinton, 50 about Cruz and 40 percent about Kasich. While Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) was not included in this poll, exit polling to date shows that Democrats trust Clinton considerably more than Sanders to handle an international crisis.But there's not solid evidence that yearning for a sober-minded commander in chief will move voters away from Trump, either. In the survey, Trump's argument -- that he'd bring strength and leadership to the Oval Office -- resonated in theory as much as Clinton's appeals to her years as Secretary of State.In a direct comparison of Clinton and Trump's merits, Clinton wins solidly, but not overwhelmingly. Forty-six percent of Americans say they trust her more to deal with an international crisis, while 34 percent trust Trump more, with the rest unsure. Independents are about evenly split between the two candidates.Candidates' foreign policy credentials may not even matter that much to voters during the general election, by which time many Americans expect that issues at home will regain center stage. While Republicans say by a 7-point margin that foreign policy will play a bigger role in 2016 than domestic policy, Democrats and independents predict by a 9-point margin that domestic policy will be more important.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted March 22-25 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

While a number of leaders there have tried banning the practice, advocates may have gotten their strongest support to date when Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke said he’s now “committed” to stopping FGM.“I’m committed to outlaw FGM in Somalia through legislation, advocacy, education and community engagement to confront the social norms that encourage the FGM practices within the society,” Sharmarke said earlier this month in response to a campaign launched by Avaaz, the organization told The Huffington Post.Avaaz, a platform that aims to empower people to take action on global issues, launched a petition that praised the government of Puntland, a region in northeast Somalia, for banning FGM. But it also called on the country’s central government to issue legislation that would outlaw the practice entirely.As of Thursday afternoon, the petition collected 1.2 million signatures. FGM involves the partial or total removal of the external female genitalia for no medical benefit and comes with a slew of health risks. It can cause severe bleeding, lead to problems urinating, cysts, infections and complications in childbirth, among other issues, according to WHO. The procedure was officially banned by the U.N. in 2012, and Somalia has taken steps to put an end to it. But the procedure is still widely practiced in Somalia and other parts of the world.In 2012, Somalia indicated it would ban the practice, but additional measures were still needed to be put forth, experts said. To solidify the movement, the country’s Ministry of Women Affairs and Human Rights announced in August that it would introduce a law that would ban FGM altogether, Somali news outlet Horseed Media reported. ‘’Time has come for us to eradicate this bad practice and protect the rights of girls and women in our country,’’ Sahra Mohammed Ali Samatar, minister of Women Affairs, said at a conference. Even with such fanfare, experts say the government needs greater pressure from advocates worldwide in order to be fomented into taking tangible steps.Waris Dirie, an advocate and former model whose face has graced Chanel ads, is hoping her star power will help push the Avaaz campaign forward. Dirie, a native of Somalia, who was cut when she was 5 years old, has publicly rejected the tradition and recalled the intense pain and rage she felt as a result.She has urged supporters to sign the petition to create a “global wave” against the practice.“It's pure violence against girls, and it destroys the rest of their lives,” Dirie told The Guardian in 2013. “And for what?

When Mr. Liang went into that building that night, he did so as part of his job and to keep the people of Brooklyn and our city safe.""Liang, 28, is scheduled to be sentenced before Brooklyn Supreme Court Justice Danny Chun on April 14. He faces up to 15 years in prison.Thompson said in comments also filed as a recommendation with the court that Liang should receive five years of probation on condition that he serves six months of home confinement with an electronic monitor. He also recommended that Liang perform 500 hours of community service.""Although we disagree with Mr. Thompson on the fundamental issue of Peter's culpability, he deserves praise for his dispassionate and courageous decision that incarceration is not called for in this case,"" Liang's attorneys Pauld Shechtman and Gabriel Chin said in a statement.Liang, who was on the police force less than a year, was convicted of manslaughter in the Nov. 20, 2014 shooting of 28-year-old Akai Gurley, which occurred in a darkened, Brooklyn public housing stairwell he was patrolling.Gurley's relatives expressed outrage over Thompson's recommendation, saying it ""sends the message that police officers who kill people should not face serious consequences.""The incident sparked protests similar to those over police shootings of other unarmed black men in Maryland, Missouri and other states.A jury found Liang responsible for firing a bullet that ricocheted off a wall and killed Gurley, who was walking one floor below. A Chinese-American, Liang testified that he was startled by a noise, which caused him to accidentally fire his gun.Although prosecutors at trial argued that it was not an accident, Thompson said the case was about justice, not about revenge. ""As I have said before, there are no winners here,"" said Thompson. ""But the sentence that I have requested is just and fair under the circumstances of this case."""

While the mechanics of human movement on a broad level has been well-studied, scientists have paid less attention to individual differences in movement, until now. ""We show that different individuals have different motor signatures,"" she said. ""In other words, individuals could be classified based on the way they move.""Namely, the extent to which your movements are similar to another person’s can determine how easily you can coordinate with that person and how similar your behaviors are.The research, which was published in the journal Interface on Wednesday, involved a series of three experiments and about 82 participants. Some of the participants were asked to play a ""plain mirror game,"" in which two players imitated each other's movements, which were tracked and analyzed.It turned out that the players who were better at mimicking each other's movements -- including qualities like speed and weight of movement -- also exhibited more collective behaviors. By comparing the two individuals' movement signatures, the researchers could also determine the level of comfort and rapport in the relationship.Imitation is known to be important to our ability to develop friendships and form bonds with others.""We know that when people move in synchrony -- marching, chanting, drumming, etc. -- it stimulates collaboration,"" said Carol Kinsey Goman, body language expert and author of The Silent Language of Leaders, who was not involved in the study. ""It is normal, human behavior to mirror the posture and movement of those we agree with and like.""These new findings suggest that people who are better able to sync their individual movement signatures with each other’s have personalities that are more compatible.""This study shows that people who move in a certain way, will also react in similar ways when they are performing joint tasks,"" Tsaneva-Atanasova said in a statement. ""Essentially, our movements give an insight into our inherent personality traits."" The researchers concluded that analyzing these motor signatures could one day offer a new pathway into diagnosing and treating mental illness, such as conditions involving social phobias. For instance, scientists could develop virtual reality technology in which a patient is asked to mimic the bodily movements of an avatar. ""What we demonstrate is that ... movement gives an indication of a person's behavioral characteristics,"" Tsaneva-Atanasova said.

One of the officers claimed he was slashed, and another officer later produced what he falsely claimed was the weapon Lightfoot used, according to prosecutors.One of the 10 officers charged in the incident will be tried separately at a later date.Rikers Island, which houses approximately 10,000 inmates and is one of the country's largest jail complexes, has been plagued for years by what critics say is a pervasive culture of abuse.Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration has instituted a comprehensive plan to reduce violence at the jail by both inmates and officers, including better training, more cameras and updated use-of-force policies.Some city and state officials, including Governor Andrew Cuomo, have floated the idea of closing Rikers permanently, a proposal that de Blasio has dismissed as unworkable.The 30-year-old Lightfoot, who is expected to testify at trial, was released from prison in 2014 after serving a sentence for robbery. He has also filed a civil lawsuit against the city and the officers.Lawyers in the criminal case have been ordered not to comment publicly about the trial.

11,POLITICS,The Supreme Court's Conservatives Don't Seem To Know What Obamacare Actually Does,Jeffrey Young and Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-conservatives-obamacare_us_56f3297ce4b0c3ef5217eeee,"For one thing, it doesn't offer a ""birth control only"" plan.",2016-03-24,"Supreme Court Justice John Roberts, right, speaks with Cardinal Donald Wuerl, archbishop of Washington, D.C. on Oct. 4, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f45b081e000095007114c2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court has taken four big whacks at the Affordable Care Act in as many years. But the conservative justices still don't seem to understand how it works.During oral arguments this week in Zubik v. Burwell -- a set of seven challenges to Obamacare's contraceptive-coverage mandate on behalf of religious nonprofits -- Chief Justice John Roberts and his colleagues on the court's conservative wing gave the impression that they don't really grasp what the ACA's health insurance exchanges do, or indeed how the market for health insurance itself even functions. In a nutshell, Zubik hinges on the question of whether it's a ""substantial burden"" for religious nonprofits to be required to fill out a form noting their objections to providing contraception under the law. The Little Sisters of the Poor and a smattering of religious nonprofits from across the country argue that it does -- that, in fact, it essentially makes them complicit in providing coverage for services they view as sinful. The federal government, which provided this accommodation, obviously disagrees.During a back-and-forth in the courtroom about women whose employers don't cover contraception, and the subsequent lengths they must go to get it, Roberts suggested that it's not actually a big deal if women in such situations have to get their birth control covered some other way. Justices Anthony Kennedy and Samuel Alito appeared to share the same belief. “They’re on the exchanges, right?” Roberts said, implying that women without access to contraception from their religious employers can just sign up to receive it through the federal insurance exchanges instead.For Justice Sonia Sotomayor, this seemed to be the last straw.“They’re not on the exchanges,” she said. “That’s a falsehood.”Sotomayor went on to explain to Roberts -- and anyone else who needed to hear it -- how exactly the exchanges work.“The exchanges require full-­service health insurance policies with minimum coverages that are set forth that are very comprehensive,” she said.Sotomayor is correct: There is no such thing as a ""birth control only"" policy. The Affordable Care Act simply doesn't allow any type of insurance that isn't comprehensive to be sold on the exchange marketplaces. Roberts either didn't know that, or was pretending not to. In most states, even dental plans for adults are only available to those who also are buying full-coverage medical insurance.In other words, it is impossible, under current law, to go out and buy contraceptive-only coverage on the exchanges. That would amount to ""creating a new program,"" as Sotomayor said. These marketplaces are intended for people whose employers don't even offer them health benefits, not for people seeking supplemental coverage of some kind.Even if the law were changed to make it possible to buy ""birth control only"" coverage, insurers would have little incentive to offer it. Insurance works when lots of people buy it and only some people use it. A customer in the market for an insurance policy that covers only one thing -- like contraception -- presumably intends to use that benefit, which undermines the entire point of insurance. U.S. Solicitor General Donald Verrilli repeatedly argued Wednesday that despite what Roberts and Alito evidently believe, it's not easy for women to get contraception covered some way other than their health insurance. At one point, Verrilli urged Roberts to “put yourself in the position” of a woman without contraceptive coverage. As Verrilli pointed out, the underlying aim of the so-called birth control mandate is to ensure that virtually all insured people have access to this benefit as part of their regular insurance coverage for preventative medicine.""It is precisely the problem,"" Verrilli said in response to a question from Alito urging a contraceptive-only plan. ""It's not a less restrictive alternative, because it has precisely the problem Congress was trying to overcome in the preventive services provision.""Thus, the proposed ""fix"" for the disagreement in Zubik would leave all of these employees without birth control benefits -- a scenario that would directly contradict Congress' intent.The consequence of this kind of diminished access is clear when it comes to another medical service that provokes a religious backlash: abortion. The Affordable Care Act doesn't require all health insurance companies to cover abortion, and it prohibits federal subsidies from being applied to that end. Health insurers that want to cover abortion have to ""segregate"" the funds and pay for that coverage separately. Prior to Obamacare, abortion was a standard covered benefit in most private health insurance. But state lawmakers have clamped down, and many states now forbid insurance from covering abortion, even for women who don't receive federal subsidies for their insurance. As a result, health insurance coverage for abortion is now more limited than before the ACA. A ruling in Zubik v. Burwell that eliminated contraceptive coverage for workers at employers like the Little Sisters would similarly leave women paying out of pocket for birth control, because there would be no alternative. After Sotomayor's effort at correcting Roberts on the facts, the chief justice seemed to want more clarification from Verrili. “Is that true with every policy sold on the exchanges?” he asked. The answer was obviously yes. But Roberts continued probing and questioning how the exchanges work, apparently unwilling to let go of the idea that somehow a woman could get covered simply by “signing a paper” to get on an insurance exchange. At one point, he even suggested that “constitutional objections” to a faulty law are sometimes what lead to its improvement.Roberts wasn’t alone. Kennedy also latched onto the idea that it's ""so easy"" and ""so free"" to sign up for a contraceptive-only plan, and likened a religious employer's providing contraception to “subsidizing conduct that they deemed immoral.”Alito at one point suggested that women who work for small employers, and who thus must buy policies on the exchanges, somehow “frustrate” the government’s desire to give all women access to free contraception. Verrilli set him straight immediately.“No,” Verrilli said flatly, “because in that circumstance... the only option that that employee has is to buy an individual policy on the exchange. And that individual policy will contain the contraceptive coverage from your regular doctor as part of your regular health care.”"

Chris Collins says the GOP front-runner has ""been misquoted.""",2016-03-24,Rep. Chris Collins speaks to the media after a meeting with Donald Trump in Washington on March 21. The New York congressman is the first legislator to endorse the GOP front-runner.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f421a1150000ad000b31cc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- When Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) became the first member of Congress to endorse Donald Trump for president, the reaction on Capitol Hill ranged from, ""Um, what?"" to ""Uh, who?""Collins, a rank-and-file Republican who had previously endorsed Jeb Bush, wasn't exactly on the shortlist of members expected to get on board with the bombastic and increasingly conservative Trump.But the story behind Collins' support is maybe just as strange as the endorsement itself. A recent report from Syracuse.com detailed how deep-pocketed real estate developer and former New York gubernatorial candidate Carl Paladino might have played a key role in securing Collins' backing for Trump, describing how Paladino told GOP members from New York to get behind the front-runner or else face the wrath of his email list -- or maybe even a primary challenger.The pressure caused Collins to recently send this text message to his New York colleagues:""I know Carl Paladino has been aggressively pushing all of you to endorse Trump. And I know he has indicated he will start 'attacking' NYers who don't endorse Trump. You may or may not care, but he does have a formidable email list.""In an interview with The Huffington Post this week, Collins denied he was ""pressured"" into supporting Trump, saying he endorsed the GOP front-runner without speaking to Paladino about it.But pressed on whether the two had discussed an endorsement, he backtracked:""Uh, so -- I mean, Carl and I know each other,"" Collins said.Either way, Collins acknowledged that Paladino is a ""big Trump guy"" and that ""he's been pushing other New York members to endorse.""Collins told HuffPost that his role between Paladino and the other New York Republican members was brokering a sort of detente, where Paladino would lay off pushing for an endorsement before the primary filing deadline and Collins would remind his colleagues that, once the deadline had passed, Paladino would be back at it.Regardless, Collins says he believes Trump is the best man for the job -- ""no two ways about it."" ""He's the only chief executive, not chief politician,"" Collins said.When asked whether he has any concerns about some of Trump's more egregious behavior and remarks, Collins came up with an explanation that was downright Trumpian.""What I'm going to say is he's been misquoted many times,"" Collins said.When pressed that he's clearly been accurately quoted many times, saying horrific things about women and minorities, among others, Collins said, ""Well, he's also been misquoted, and they've taken things out of context.""After some crosstalk, Collins said, ""I'm very comfortable with his stance on defense, I'm very comfortable with his stance on jobs, I'm very comfortable with -- his actions speak louder than words on the women's issues.""Pressed about Trump's statements on women, Collins interrupted the question and blurted out, ""I'm saying actions speak louder than words!""When the actions of Trump's campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, who's been accused of roughly grabbing a reporter and making sexually charged comments about female reporters, came up, an aide nearby tried to end the interview.""I am solidly, 100 percent behind Donald Trump,"" Collins said, summing up his final thought.Collins comes from a strongly Republican district covering Buffalo, New York, where Paladino lives. Whether Paladino actually threatened Collins with a primary challenge -- either to run himself or put someone up with his considerable fortune -- is unknown, but it's clear Paladino has been pressuring New York Republicans to support Trump.Another New York Republican, Rep. Lee Zeldin, told HuffPost this week that he got the impression Paladino was ""reaching out to everyone"" in the delegation.Asked whether it sounded plausible that Paladino and Collins hadn't talked about endorsing Trump before Collins came out in public support, Zeldin gave an incredulous look.""You're -- you're saying that Collins said he didn't speak to Paladino before he announced that he was endorsing Trump? I mean, I -- I don't know anything about their relationship,"" Zeldin said.One thing, however, is known: Another New York Republican, Rep. Tom Reed, endorsed Trump last week -- the same week that Paladino sent an email out to 50,000+ recipients with the subject line: ""Anyone interested in running in a primary to defeat Elise Stefanik?""Stefanik is the youngest woman to ever serve in Congress and is another New York Republican."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) resonated with her, she said. In February, she registered in Maricopa County, looking forward to voting for the first time in her life. Arizona uses a closed primary system, meaning that a voter must register as a Democrat to vote for a Democratic presidential candidate or as a Republican to vote on the GOP side. Robbins registered as a Democrat on Feb. 18, four days before the primary registration deadline. She received her voter registration card identifying her as a Democrat in the mail. On Tuesday, Robbins brought her 9-month-old son to a polling site in Avondale, Arizona, and stood in line for two hours, waiting to vote. One she was inside, a poll worker scanned her identification card and said she came up in the system as “party not designated."" The poll worker suggested that Robbins cast a provisional ballot.Robbins insisted they scan her card again. This time, the system said she was registered as a Republican. She was told she wouldn’t be able to vote a regular ballot, even when she showed her voter registration card.Robbins says the poll worker told her that her provisional ballot probably wouldn’t count. Arizona discards more provisional ballots than most larger states, so this was probably correct. Robbins says she asked for a number where she could call and complain, and the poll worker refused to give her one.Robbins reached out to the office of Michele Reagan, Arizona's secretary of state. She was told that she was indeed registered as a Democrat. Then she was transferred to a supervisor who told her that even though she had registered before the deadline, the state hadn't processed her registration in time, and therefore she wasn’t actually registered. “I’ve waited my entire adult life, and I finally find somebody I want to vote for, and they deny me,” Robbins said. “I left there crying. It’s always been my dream to vote, but I hadn’t found a politician I liked enough to vote for.” Robbins’ experience on Tuesday wasn’t unique. A number of Arizona-based outlets reported that there were widespread problems with voter registration in several counties. The Washington Post reports that election officials blamed a computer glitch that switched Democrats to independents in the system.The media, meanwhile, has mainly focused on the long lines that formed at voting places throughout Maricopa County. Some voters waited up to five hours on Tuesday to cast a ballot. The long lines were a predictable result of the county’s decision to cut its number of voting sites from 200 to 60, which the county said it did to cut costs. (Pima County, which has just one-fourth as many eligible voters as Maricopa County, had more than twice as many polling places this week.)Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell (R), who is in charge of the county's elections, partially blamed ""the voters, for getting in line,” but later admitted to making “bad decisions” and said the county had underestimated how many voting sites it would need. Purcell’s office did not respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment.Theresa Caplis, 47, has lived in the same house in Gilbert, Arizona, for 12 years. Like Robbins, she had problems voting in Maricopa County this Tuesday. Caplis and her husband waited two hours to vote at library near their house, and while he had no problem casting a regular ballot, she was told that she had already voted when the poll worker scanned her identification. She was told she had requested an early ballot (she hadn't), and the poll worker gave her a provisional ballot. She says she doesn’t know whether her vote actually counted. “I’ve never seen that many people vote with provisional ballots before,” Caplis told HuffPost. “The containers for the provisional ballots were full. I could hardly fit mine in.” Caplis joked that this happened to her because she'd canvassed for Sanders the weekend before.“I felt like they’re trying to have someone win. I feel like it’s set up,” she said. “Someone is interfering with the process.”The number of comments and suspicions voiced by Sanders supporters on Reddit after the primary led Marc Elias, campaign counsel for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to weigh in. Elias argued that the way Maricopa County ran its election is “the result of a larger Republican effort to make it harder for people to vote.” “Now, some have suggested that this whole thing is a plot to shut Sanders supporters out of the process,” he wrote Wednesday on Reddit. “This just isn’t true. In Arizona (like most states), county governments administer elections. Neither the Clinton campaign nor the Sanders campaign -- nor for that matter the Trump campaign -- have anything to do with them, beyond being on the ballot. And the county with the biggest issues last night -- Maricopa -- is run almost entirely by Republicans. (In fact, there’s only one Democrat serving on the county government, and he’s a Sanders supporter.)”Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) said in a statement Wednesday that the state’s election officials must investigate what went wrong with the primary and prevent similar problems in the future. He called for making the state’s primaries open, rather than closed, so independent voters can participate. But Democrats say the state needs to focus more on the reduction in voting sites, which Ducey didn’t mention in his statement. Democrats have noted that predominantly Latino areas in Arizona had fewer voting sites this week than areas with greater numbers of white people. Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton (D) wrote the Department of Justice Wednesday asking it to investigate how Maricopa County officials “distributed fewer polling locations to parts of the county with higher minority populations.” As Zach Roth at MSNBC and Ari Berman at The Nation have noted, Maricopa County probably wouldn't have been able to slash its number of voting sites so dramatically if the Supreme Court hadn’t gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013. That federal civil rights act required Arizona and other states with a history of racial discrimination in elections to get approval from the DOJ or a federal court before making any changes to their electoral procedures or policies, to ensure such changes wouldn't leave voters of color worse off.

17,POLITICS,Arizona's Primary Problems Go Way Beyond Long Lines,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arizona-primary-problems_us_56f41094e4b04c4c376184ca,"""I finally find somebody I want to vote for, and they deny me.""",2016-03-24,"Maricopa County sent Jennifer Robbins a voter registration card that listed her party as ""DEM,"" for ""Democratic."" Some information has been blurred out to preserve her privacy.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f42de61e00008e01711448.jpeg?ops=crop_0_234_3264_1413%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Jennifer Robbins’ appalling experience with Arizona’s election process illustrates just how chaotic the state's presidential primary was on Tuesday.Robbins, 27, had never before “found a politician that I felt like I could put my faith in.” But the message of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) resonated with her, she said. In February, she registered in Maricopa County, looking forward to voting for the first time in her life. Arizona uses a closed primary system, meaning that a voter must register as a Democrat to vote for a Democratic presidential candidate or as a Republican to vote on the GOP side. Robbins registered as a Democrat on Feb. 18, four days before the primary registration deadline. She received her voter registration card identifying her as a Democrat in the mail. On Tuesday, Robbins brought her 9-month-old son to a polling site in Avondale, Arizona, and stood in line for two hours, waiting to vote. One she was inside, a poll worker scanned her identification card and said she came up in the system as “party not designated."" The poll worker suggested that Robbins cast a provisional ballot.Robbins insisted they scan her card again. This time, the system said she was registered as a Republican. She was told she wouldn’t be able to vote a regular ballot, even when she showed her voter registration card.Robbins says the poll worker told her that her provisional ballot probably wouldn’t count. Arizona discards more provisional ballots than most larger states, so this was probably correct. Robbins says she asked for a number where she could call and complain, and the poll worker refused to give her one.Robbins reached out to the office of Michele Reagan, Arizona's secretary of state. She was told that she was indeed registered as a Democrat. Then she was transferred to a supervisor who told her that even though she had registered before the deadline, the state hadn't processed her registration in time, and therefore she wasn’t actually registered. “I’ve waited my entire adult life, and I finally find somebody I want to vote for, and they deny me,” Robbins said. “I left there crying. It’s always been my dream to vote, but I hadn’t found a politician I liked enough to vote for.” Robbins’ experience on Tuesday wasn’t unique. A number of Arizona-based outlets reported that there were widespread problems with voter registration in several counties. The Washington Post reports that election officials blamed a computer glitch that switched Democrats to independents in the system.The media, meanwhile, has mainly focused on the long lines that formed at voting places throughout Maricopa County. Some voters waited up to five hours on Tuesday to cast a ballot. The long lines were a predictable result of the county’s decision to cut its number of voting sites from 200 to 60, which the county said it did to cut costs. (Pima County, which has just one-fourth as many eligible voters as Maricopa County, had more than twice as many polling places this week.)Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell (R), who is in charge of the county's elections, partially blamed ""the voters, for getting in line,” but later admitted to making “bad decisions” and said the county had underestimated how many voting sites it would need. Purcell’s office did not respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment.Theresa Caplis, 47, has lived in the same house in Gilbert, Arizona, for 12 years. Like Robbins, she had problems voting in Maricopa County this Tuesday. Caplis and her husband waited two hours to vote at library near their house, and while he had no problem casting a regular ballot, she was told that she had already voted when the poll worker scanned her identification. She was told she had requested an early ballot (she hadn't), and the poll worker gave her a provisional ballot. She says she doesn’t know whether her vote actually counted. “I’ve never seen that many people vote with provisional ballots before,” Caplis told HuffPost. “The containers for the provisional ballots were full. I could hardly fit mine in.” Caplis joked that this happened to her because she'd canvassed for Sanders the weekend before.“I felt like they’re trying to have someone win. I feel like it’s set up,” she said. “Someone is interfering with the process.”The number of comments and suspicions voiced by Sanders supporters on Reddit after the primary led Marc Elias, campaign counsel for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to weigh in. Elias argued that the way Maricopa County ran its election is “the result of a larger Republican effort to make it harder for people to vote.” “Now, some have suggested that this whole thing is a plot to shut Sanders supporters out of the process,” he wrote Wednesday on Reddit. “This just isn’t true. In Arizona (like most states), county governments administer elections. Neither the Clinton campaign nor the Sanders campaign -- nor for that matter the Trump campaign -- have anything to do with them, beyond being on the ballot. And the county with the biggest issues last night -- Maricopa -- is run almost entirely by Republicans. (In fact, there’s only one Democrat serving on the county government, and he’s a Sanders supporter.)”Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) said in a statement Wednesday that the state’s election officials must investigate what went wrong with the primary and prevent similar problems in the future. He called for making the state’s primaries open, rather than closed, so independent voters can participate. But Democrats say the state needs to focus more on the reduction in voting sites, which Ducey didn’t mention in his statement. Democrats have noted that predominantly Latino areas in Arizona had fewer voting sites this week than areas with greater numbers of white people. Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton (D) wrote the Department of Justice Wednesday asking it to investigate how Maricopa County officials “distributed fewer polling locations to parts of the county with higher minority populations.” As Zach Roth at MSNBC and Ari Berman at The Nation have noted, Maricopa County probably wouldn't have been able to slash its number of voting sites so dramatically if the Supreme Court hadn’t gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013.

Dirks said on Thursday that the school will step up its efforts to fight sexual assault and provide resources to victims.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f43e8f1e00008700705430.jpeg?cache=OL5klJhM1m&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The University of California, Berkeley will set up a review board to ensure that it issues appropriate sanctions for sexual assault and harassment cases involving staff and faculty on campus. Nicholas Dirks, the school's chancellor, announced the review board and several other steps in a campus-wide email on Thursday. The university plans to organize a half-day event filled with teach-ins and seminars about sexual violence, and will make additional hires in offices that provide counseling and health services to sexual assault victims.Cal will also establish a new ""Sexual Violence and Sexual Harassment Task Force"" in April and hire more people to staff its Office for Prevention of Discrimination and Harassment to resolve sexual violence cases more efficiently, Dirks' email said.The university is currently under a Title IX investigation by the Department of Education and faces a related lawsuit that claims it mishandled sexual assault cases involving students.In the 2015-16 academic year, Cal was rocked by sexual harassment allegations against faculty, and came under criticism for lax sanctions handed down by school administrators.Sujit Choudhry stepped down as the law school dean this month after a lawsuit stated the university found him in violation of its sexual harassment policy. His punishment was a 10 percent pay cut for one year, and Provost Claude Steele ordered him to get counseling. Famed astronomer Geoff Marcy resigned last fall after news reports revealed the school found him guilty of sexual harassment, but let him off with a slap on the wrist.And earlier this month, Cal moved to fire an assistant basketball coach who reportedly harassed a female reporter, and is now investigating whether the head coach delayed reporting the allegations.""In the last two weeks, we have met with survivors, faculty, staff, students, alumni, and community leaders,"" Dirks wrote in his message, co-signed by Steele. ""We are grateful for their forthright comments, honest feedback, and constructive suggestions. And, we have heard the salient message: there is much work to be done. We take our responsibility here seriously, and we intend to have Berkeley lead in this area, as it has in so many others.""Cal student Meghan Warner, one of the complainants who sparked the federal Title IX investigation, said she's pleased to see more resources going toward the offices handling investigations and advocating for survivors.However, she called the new task force a ""a waste of time and resources.""""We don't need yet another official-sounding task force, and it's clear he's creating this because it looks good, not because it will most effectively address the issues survivors have been pointing out for years,"" said Warner, who also serves on an existing task force called the ""coordinated community response team."" ""I was in a meeting with Steele a few years back where we explained Title IX investigation issues and sanction issues, and how everyone keeps saying they take this issue seriously, but they do nothing about it,"" she told The Huffington Post. ""So it hurts to see him do the same thing years later. It's about reputation, not student and employee safety.""Sofie Karasek, one of the recent graduates suing UC Berkeley, said she was also skeptical that the new task force would be any different from previous task forces, like the one set up for all University of California system campuses in 2014, or the previous Title IX advisory group at Berkeley.""It is blatantly obvious that the sole purpose of establishing yet another task force is being able to announce its creation,"" Karasek said. ""The students I know who were on Berkeley-specific task forces and working groups over the years routinely complained that key administrators would not bother showing up to meetings, that the meetings would be scheduled at inopportune times, and that little to nothing was accomplished during them.""As for the review board for sanctions, Warner said that is a positive step, depending on who is included on it. The review board will ensure that sanctions for faculty and staff found guilty of violating university policy on sexual assault and harassment ""are dealt with in a firm and consistent manner, regardless of the rank or position of either the complainant or respondent,"" Dirks' message said. The campus-wide event Dirks announced will focus on sexual violence ""learning and awareness activities"" and is planned for early fall.""We will also provide significantly more resources to support interactive and performance-based learning activities, as well as develop new experiential learning programs designed specifically to help all members of our community identify, confront, and stop abuses of power, including sexual harassment,"" he said. The event is a response to the state auditor's 2014 recommendation that the school ""engage all students in several key educational opportunities including a comprehensive, coordinated, and evidence-based social norms education."" The auditor’s office concluded in its last update in 2015 that the school had “not fully implemented” anti-harassment and violence training that would reach all students. _______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter who covers higher education and sexual violence, and is based in New York.

The Detroit Promise Zone covers kids who have been accepted to one of the city's five community colleges and who spent their junior and senior years at a city high school -- public, private or charter.The public program builds on the private Detroit Scholarship Fund, which has been offering subsidized tuition to local students since 2013. The Detroit Scholarship Fund has been supported by two private groups, the Michigan Education Excellence Foundation and the Detroit Regional Chamber. They have agreed to fund the Detroit Promise Zone for the next two years. At that point, the promise will be upheld with tax dollars, according to a statement from Duggan's office. In the future, the mayor said he hopes to also subsidize four years of tuition at public universities.“It doesn’t matter whether you’re a high school senior preparing for college now or a second-grader whose college career is years away,” Duggan said in his statement. “The Detroit Promise will be there to help make a college education a reality.”It's not easy being a public school student in Detroit. Eighty percent of the kids are eligible for free or reduced price lunches. The district itself is hundreds of millions of dollars in debt and could run out of money to pay teachers by April if action is not taken. Over the past few months, teachers have staged a series of mass sickouts to protest poor working conditions and deteriorating facilities. In late January, the American Federation of Teachers -- one of the nation's largest teachers unions -- filed a lawsuit against the district, arguing that it has forced students “to spend their young lives in deplorable surroundings, risking their health and safety in the process, and imposing on students and their teachers an atmosphere that interferes with their securing a minimally sufficient education.”The Detroit Promise Zone is designed to make sure that “a family’s financial situation is no longer a roadblock to our city’s young people getting the education that they need,” Penny Bailer, chairwoman of the Detroit Promise Zone Authority Board, said in a statement. Detroit's efforts follow in the footsteps of other cities. The Kalamazoo Promise program was established in 2005 to subsidize tuition for students in that Michigan municipality seeking to attend public universities. Since then, a number of other cities and states -- like Chicago and Tennessee -- have launched their own initiatives to fund community college for local youth.A grandmother to five children in Detroit, Martha Williams said the program will make a tangible difference.“My kids aren’t able to pay for even community college,” she told the Detroit Free Press. “This will help.""Rebecca Klein covers the challenges of school discipline, school segregation and the achievement gap in K-12 education.

21,POLITICS,Bathroom Panic Has Long Stood In The Way Of Equal Rights,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bathroom-panic_us_56f40300e4b0c3ef521820e3,The women's movement and now the LGBT movement have run up against restroom fears.,2016-03-24,Phyllis Schafly and other activists protested against the Equal Rights Amendment outside the White House in February 1977.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f404a01e0000b30070537c.jpeg?cache=pNzEJ6j0iV&ops=crop_18_73_4782_2889%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) signed a restrictive law Wednesday night that bars localities from passing anti-discrimination protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals. The consequences include prohibiting transgender people from using restrooms based on their gender identity, rather than the gender on their birth certificates. The frantic push by GOP legislators to pass this measure came after Charlotte, the state's largest city, approved an ordinance last month providing comprehensive nondiscrimination protections -- including allowing transgender individuals to use their preferred restroom. And it was that issue that opponents seized on. ""It is not only the citizens of Charlotte that will be impacted by changing basic restroom and locker room norms but also citizens from across our state and nation who visit and work in Charlotte,"" McCrory warned late last month. ""This shift in policy could also create major public safety issues by putting citizens in possible danger from deviant actions by individuals taking improper advantage of a bad policy.""Bathroom panic also doomed an equal rights ordinance in Houston in November. The measure would have barred discrimination on the basis of race, age, military status, disability and 11 other categories, but all anyone could talk about was what it would allegedly do to public restrooms. Opponents ran a brutal ad showing a man entering a bathroom stall with a young girl. “Any man at any time could enter a woman’s bathroom simply by claiming to be a woman that day,” the narrator warned.The LGBT movement is the latest to come up against the sanctity of the public restroom, but it's not the first. In the mid-1970s, the Equal Rights Amendment appeared headed for passage, just a few states short of the 38 ratifications it needed. The constitutional amendment guaranteed that ""Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex."" But supporters weren't ready for Phyllis Schlafly, the conservative activist who successfully mobilized against the ERA by warning that it would lead to the military drafting women and the proliferation of public unisex bathrooms. Then, as now, scaring people about what could happen behind closed stall doors proved to be very effective, as even ERA supporters admitted. In March 1976, investigative columnist Jack Anderson revealed that the right-wing fringe John Birch Society helped gin up opposition to the ERA by distributing literature that ""claims the amendment would make homosexual marriages legal, would outlaw separate public restroom facilities and would eliminate the separate state's authority over marriage, divorce and child care."" Operation Wake Up, a coalition of groups opposed to the ERA, also pushed the bathroom issue. An activist dressed up as a ""common toilet"" and crossed out the words ""his"" and ""hers"" and wrote ""theirs.""But as with the LGBT fight, these fears were misplaced. As Timothy Schellhardt of The Wall Street Journal explained in a 1979 piece, ""Despite talk about all sorts of compulsory mixing of the sexes, the right to privacy would permit segregated locker rooms and school dormitories.""And localities that have enacted LGBT-inclusive nondiscrimination ordinances have not seen an uptick in transgender predators -- or predators pretending to be transgender -- entering restrooms and assaulting people. Such behavior would remain a crime anyway, with or without gender identity protections. In fact, the people who are most at-risk in bathrooms are transgender men and women. A 2013 study by the Williams Institute, a think tank at UCLA School of Law dedicated to studying LGBT issues, found that 70 percent of transgender or gender non-conforming respondents in Washington, D.C., ""reported being denied access, verbally harassed, or physically assaulted in public restrooms.""James Parker Sheffield, a transgender man who directs an LGBT-focused organization in Georgia, said he now fears for his safety if he visits North Carolina and uses a public restroom. ""Besides the obvious misconception that trans people are in a public restroom to do anything other than use the restroom,"" he said, ""I think most people neglect to see the personal safety issues connected to these poorly conceived legislative moves."""

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) insisted he'll stay in the presidential race, but outlined conditions under which he would endorse Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton ""if I can't make it.""Sanders, who badly trails Clinton in delegates for the Democratic nomination, said Wednesday that his chief priorities include making sure the party embraces his anti-establishment platform and expands its base.""If I can't make it -- and we're going to try as hard as we can until the last vote is cast -- we want to completely revitalize the Democratic Party and make it a party of the people rather than one of large campaign contributors,"" Sanders said in an interview on the progressive Web show ""The Young Turks.""Sanders also listed policy demands he would make of Clinton, including a single-payer health care system, a $15 an hour minimum wage, tougher regulation of the finance industry, closing corporate tax loopholes and ""a vigorous effort to address climate change.""""I am very worried. I mean, I talk to these scientists. This planet is in serious danger. You can't cuddle up to the fossil fuel industry -- you've got to take them on,"" Sanders said, alluding to Clinton's ties to oil and gas companies.He also expressed concern about Clinton's consistency on policy issues.""What we need is to create a movement which holds elected officials accountable and not let them flip"" on issues, Sanders said.Sanders trails Clinton in delegates, despite recent primary election and caucus victories. Some Democratic leaders have said they fear that if Clinton becomes the nominee, she may not pick up the support of Sanders' progressive base.Sanders' pitch to Democratic voters has involved bringing his policy differences with Clinton to the forefront, labeling her as an establishment candidate and questioning her beliefs on issues important to the party's base. Clinton would likely have to adopt more of Sanders' policy positions to win over his supporters.One factor that may propel Sanders supporters into Clinton's camp in November would be real estate mogul Donald Trump, if he wins the Republican nomination.According to recent polls, Trump has abysmally low favorability ratings among women and Latinos. Both groups have frequently been the subject of his attacks, and both tend to vote Democratic.But Sanders stressed on Wednesday that he does not intend to cede the stage to Clinton yet. Some Democrats have called on him to exit the race so the party can begin strategizing for the general election. The New York Times reported last week that even President Barack Obama privately suggested it was time for Sanders to step aside.""We are in this thing to win,"" Sanders said."

The FBI is considering whether to investigate the company for deliberately misleading the public about climate change.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f41bc71e000087007053e7.jpeg?cache=HYj6iLTKpR&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Rockefeller Family Fund will divest from fossil fuels, prioritizing Exxon Mobil holdings.The Rockefeller Family Fund is divesting from major segments of the fossil fuel industry, the fund said in an announcement that also singled out Exxon Mobil for blistering criticism.The nonprofit trust, which was started by the heirs of the industrial-era oil monopolist John D. Rockefeller, called Exxon Mobil’s alleged efforts to cover up evidence of climate change “morally reprehensible conduct” in a Wednesday statement.The fund, which provides grants to further environmentalism, women's rights and corporate and government accountability, is the latest in a long list of institutions to divest from oil, gas or coal holdings.With assets of $130 million, the trust is hardly the largest institution to make the leap. (The significantly larger Rockefeller Brothers Fund, another family philanthropic venture, made the divestment pledge in September 2014.)The day before the announcement, the Securities and Exchange Commission dealt Exxon another setback. On Tuesday, the SEC ruled in favor of a group of shareholders who are pushing the company closer to disclosing its vulnerability to climate change and new government regulations.But the fund's stinging indictment of Exxon Mobil, part of a new escalation of investor-driven climate change advocacy, is especially notable because it comes from the heirs of the Standard Oil fortune, the mega-company from which Exxon Mobil first emerged.“Evidence appears to suggest that the company worked since the 1980s to confuse the public about climate change’s march, while simultaneously spending millions to fortify its own infrastructure against climate change’s destructive consequences and track new exploration opportunities as the Arctic’s ice receded,” the fund's statement says. “Appropriate authorities will determine if the company violated any laws, but as a matter of good governance, we cannot be associated with a company exhibiting such apparent contempt for the public interest.” In the first stage of its divestment process, the fund will immediately eliminate all Exxon Mobil holdings, as well as all investments in coal and “tar sands-based companies” that the fund holds directly. directly managed by the fund, rather than outside asset managers. It will limit its “exposures for these three categories of investment” to less than 1 percent of its holdings. The second stage will involve divesting from other fossil fuels the fund holds directly, and all fossil fuels held in commingled funds.""That is a longer process because these commingled funds are very difficult to get out of and we have to be very cognizant of our fiduciary duty to the institution,"" said Lee Wasserman, director of the Rockefeller Family Fund.Exxon Mobil's potential involvement in denying climate science first came to light in the fall, when Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times published explosive reports suggesting the company had privately acknowledged the reality of climate change even as it cast doubt on the science in public. After those reports, Reps. Ted Lieu and Mark DeSaulnier, Democratic congressmen from California, asked the Department of Justice to investigate whether the oil giant violated federal laws like the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act. (The federal government used RICO to press charges against tobacco companies 1999, claiming they had engaged in a conspiracy to suppress evidence of tobacco products’ health risks.) Earlier this month, the DOJ asked the FBI to look into whether Exxon Mobil acted illegally.Exxon, for its part, brushed off the Rockefeller Family Fund’s divestment decision.“It's not surprising that they're divesting from the company since they're already funding a conspiracy against us,” the company said in a statement. The company pointed to the fund’s financial support for Inside Climate News and the Columbia University Journalism School, the latter of which collaborated with the Los Angeles Times on its series of stories about Exxon. Exxon called the influential reporting backed by the fund “inaccurate and deliberately misleading stories about ExxonMobil’s history of climate research.”Wasserman said the grant to Inside Climate News was made without any knowledge that it would be used for the reporting project. The grant to Columbia Journalism School was directed at ""public interest research into what the fossil fuel industry understood about the science of climate change and how they acted given that understanding both internally and regarding the public,"" but it did not target Exxon Mobil specifically, Wasserman said."
27,POLITICS,The Obama Administration Just Took A Huge Step On Worker Safety,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-silica-rule_us_56f42cf2e4b0c3ef521849c0,"It's known as the silica rule, and it's a big frigging deal.",2016-03-24,The silica rule has been in the works for four decades.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After an extraordinarily long wait -- 45 years, to be exact -- the government is finally ramping up protections for workers from a carcinogen we've been aware of for centuries. The reform marks the most significant change in workplace health law during the Obama era, and officials project it will prevent 600 deaths per year.On Thursday, the Labor Department announced that it will be implementing what's known as the silica rule, bringing a decades-long lobbying fight in Washington to an end. Crystalline silica is a dust that comes from sand and granite, and it has been debilitating lungs for as long as workers have been cutting rock, brick and concrete. Under the new rule, the feds will be vastly lowering the amount of silica dust that companies can legally expose workers to.Occupational health experts, labor unions and sick workers have been prodding for the tougher standard for decades, only to see the reform stalled under a succession of different presidents. But their hopes were buoyed during President Barack Obama’s first term when the Labor Department developed a proposal and the White House signaled it would carry it out.With Thursday's announcement, that reform appears all but certain, unless Republicans who oppose it can manage to stymie its implementation through the appropriations process.“When I became an apprentice, I didn’t think I would be exposed to the same hazard that killed my father. They knew how to control the hazard 40 years before my father died,” Tom Ward, a bricklayer from Detroit, said Thursday. Speaking of the new rule, Ward said, “All of you who have been suffering, your voice has been heard.”Ward delivered those remarks at the International Masonry Institute, in Bowie, Maryland, where he introduced Labor Secretary Tom Perez at a press conference on the new rule.Perez began his own remarks with an apology to Ward.“I guess what I should say at the outset is I’m sorry it took this long,” Perez said. “It wasn’t for a lack of trying.”For many years, the silica rule was pretty much a victim of its own significance. As Marianne LeVine explains in Politico, meeting the requirements of the new silica rule will require an investment from employers, which is how it got bottled up in Washington for so long. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration says it will cost employers about $1 billion to implement, though some industry groups say the tab will be much greater than that.However, the diseases and ailments caused by silica dust -- silicosis, lung cancer, kidney disease and emphysema, to name just a few -- are so costly that OSHA says the new regulations will create net savings of between $3.8 and $7.7 billion. Citing those numbers Thursday, Perez said the mere discussion of dollars and cents on the issue made him uncomfortable: All along, regulators and industry have been putting a price on workers’ lungs and lives.“The evidence is overwhelming. The science is there. We have literally studied this issue to death,” Perez said, noting that sickness related to silica dust was even evident in Ancient Rome. “We've known about these dangers not just for years, and not just for centuries, but for millennia.”Federal officials set the original silica standard when OSHA was created, in 1971, under then-President Richard Nixon. But even then, health experts thought the standard was too lax, allowing masonry and construction workers to breathe unhealthy amounts of silica. As David Michaels, the head of OSHA, put it Thursday, “the standard was out of date the day we promulgated it.” Those original standards, which were based on studies from the 1960s, haven’t changed until now.For construction worksites and shipyards, the new standard will cut the allowable level of silica dust by an aggressive 80 percent. For other worksites, it will cut the allowable level by half. The new standards were first recommended by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, a division of the Centers for Disease Control, 40 years ago. OSHA says that roughly 2.3 million U.S. workers -- the vast majority of them in construction -- are exposed to airborne silica dust, particles of which are 100 times smaller than a common grain of sand. For businesses, the new silica rules will mean upgrading to equipment that can better capture dust -- for instance, grinders with vacuums attached to them -- and wetting down materials that are being cut to minimize dust. Simply having workers wear respirators, OSHA says, is not sufficient. The agency created a list of precautions that construction firms can take to minimize silica exposure. If firms opt not to follow them, they will have to measure silica levels on the worksite and submit them for testing to make sure they're in compliance.The stipulations of the rule will be gradually phased in starting next year.In a statement, the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade lobby, said the new rule was ""fundamentally flawed,"" relied on ""appallingly out-of-date economic data"" and ""requires mandates that simply are not feasible to achieve."" ""As a result, small and medium-sized manufacturers could be forced to close their doors while others will be saddled with crushing regulations,"" said Jay Timmons, the group's president.Asked about such claims, Michaels said he believes industries typically overestimate the true cost of new regulations. He argued that the real cost of the silica rule is actually ""quite low,"" and he predicted that it will ultimately be even cheaper to implement than it seems. What he wouldn't underestimate was the impact the rule will have on ordinary workers' health.""This is the most important health standard OSHA has issued in decades,"" he said. "
28,POLITICS,He Looks At Tuberculosis Death Toll And Wonders Why You're Not Worried,Lauren Weber,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tuberculosis-aaron-motsoaledi-world-tb-day_us_56f02333e4b03a640a6b1c48,"""Nobody is safe from it,"" says South Africa's health minister.",2016-03-24,"Aaron Motsoaledi, South Africa's top health official, thinks people find it too easy to ignore TB.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f0238f1e00008700704d7f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Aaron Motsoaledi is tired of delivering the same spiel over and over again.No matter how many times the charismatic health minister of South Africa speaks out, people don’t seem to grasp the threat presented by tuberculosis, now the No. 1 infectious killer in the world.“People think it’s a curable disease that’s been there for ages, so what’s new? I think that’s the mentality,” Dr. Motsoaledi told The Huffington Post.As chair of the Stop TB Partnership, a group of public and private leaders hosted through the United Nations Office for Project Service, he has seen the eyes of bureaucrats around the world glaze over when he brings up TB. And yet 4,100 people die every day from the disease.His own country is one of the hardest hit. Motsoaledi has pushed to organize a comprehensive TB strategy for South Africa and its neighbors. In South Africa, they've targeted those who work in the country's mines and inhabit its prisons, two communities where TB rates are particularly high.Death by tuberculosis, he said, “happens very slowly, maybe in a corner somewhere, in an isolated hospital ward, with nobody watching, so it doesn’t evoke any emotion. Maybe that’s what’s at play around the entire world.”HuffPost spoke with Motsoaledi about the growing threat of tuberculosis ahead of World TB Day on Thursday.In your own words, what is the TB global health crisis?It’s growing, even though we’ve made inroads since 1990. But the fact that TB has been there for the past 200 years -- I’ll say we went into some form of relaxation and started relaxing and believing that this is a disease for which you have got a cure.Now the biggest problem we are having is that, unlike HIV and AIDS, unlike Ebola, unlike Zika, TB doesn’t seem to be having a fear effect. People are all right with it, despite the body count. You can show the body count, but as long as it’s from TB, it doesn’t seem to be touching people. They seem to be having accepted it as a normal progression of events on the planet that something like this must happen.With the advent of Ebola in West Africa, 6,000 kilometers away from us in South Africa, everybody was worried to death to an extent that they were attacking me every day -- the media, the public, members of Parliament. They were telling me I’m not doing enough to stop it. ...But 12 months later, 40,000 people dead of tuberculosis [in South Africa] and not a single one died of Ebola. 40,000! But still that did not change the situation. Nothing changed.Why do you think there isn't the same ""fear effect"" for tuberculosis?People think it’s a curable disease that’s been there for ages, so what’s new? I think that’s the mentality.In South Africa, I called the unions -- we have very strong unions in the mines, the National Union of Mine Workers -- I called them together with the other unions and was showing them statistics.For instance, in 2009, 80 people died in mining accidents -- you know, rockfalls and other accidents in the mines. And everybody heard about it [and they were] extremely angry, and understandably so. It's an emotional thing.I showed them that over the same period that same year, 1,500 [miners] died of TB, but it never raised any flags. Maybe part of the problem is that, for instance, [with] a rockfall in the mine, the death is very traumatic. The TB death happens very slowly. It’s a process, not really an event. It happens very slowly, maybe in a corner somewhere, in an isolated hospital ward, with nobody watching, so it doesn’t evoke any emotion. Maybe that’s what’s at play around the entire world.What should be done globally to deal with the health security threat posed by drug-resistant strains of TB?Look, we are now waking up to be faced with antimicrobial resistance. We are possibly faced with a post-antibiotic era, which is very scary -- where ordinary drugs cannot be used to treat ordinary infections. And one-third of the death from antimicrobial resistance is TB. ... That’s a high number, a very high number. The other problem being that because TB is airborne, nobody is safe from it. I usually tell people that I can stand up on a platform and announce to the whole world that I’m not going to [become] HIV positive. I’m not, and I can confidently say so, and it will happen because I’ll know what to do not to get HIV.But no single human being can stand up on any platform and announce to the world that they will never get TB. Nobody can say that. Anybody that says that will be lying. ... All that it needs is for you to breathe, and we all breathe continuously.Last November, the Stop TB Partnership released a report, ""The Paradigm Shift: The Global Plan to End TB,"" which lays out the steps needed to eradicate tuberculosis. Do you think it's starting to shift people's perspectives on TB? Not yet. I will really feel there has been a paradigm shift if we are able to reach all heads of states. I don’t think we’ve been able to. Within the U.N. itself, who is a champion general? Who is going to be talking about TB -- compared with Ebola, compared to malaria, compared with Zika now, compared with HIV?Until this issue goes to high-level meetings with heads of state, I won’t really say that paradigm shift has taken place.Also, we will say the paradigm shift has taken place when, like us in South Africa, most of the money for TB comes from internal sources rather than from donors like Global Fund [a public-private partnership that supports anti-AIDS, TB and malaria programs]. At the moment, the Global Fund is the biggest donor for TB processes, and many countries rely on that only.It’d be helpful if heads of state see the need that their own revenue must be utilized. Eighty percent of the treatment in South Africa is [our] own revenue, and we’d like to see the whole world doing that.If you had all the money in the world to dedicate to TB, where would you start?We have calculated in the Stop TB Partnership what it will take to stop TB. If we are not to spend many, many decades fighting the disease, we need urgent intervention. We need a vaccine immediately.We are going to struggle for a very long amount of time, spending huge amounts of money. But if we could get a vaccine, it would be a complete game-changer. Just like it happened with smallpox, just like it’s about to happen with polio.The [World Health Organization] is on the verge of announcing that polio has been wiped off the face of the Earth. We need something like that for TB. I am very eagerly looking forward to the day that that happens. This interview has been edited for clarity and length."

They are accused of conspiracy to commit computer hacking while employed by two Iran-based computer companies, ITSecTeam and Mersad Company.Firoozi is additionally charged with obtaining and abetting unauthorized access to a protected computer.At a news conference announcing the charges, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said the accused hackers caused tens of millions of dollars in damages in their assault on U.S banks. At least 46 major financial institutions and financial sector companies were targeted, including JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo and American Express, according to the indictment. AT&T was also targeted.The hackers are accused of hitting the banks with distributed denial of service attacks on a near-weekly basis, a relatively unsophisticated tactic that can bring computer networks offline by flooding servers with spammed traffic.“These attacks were relentless, they were systematic, and they were widespread,” Lynch said.But the attack on Bowman Avenue Dam in Rye Brook, New York, was especially alarming to investigators, Lynch said, because the intrusion could have posed a serious threat to the security of Americans. A stroke of good fortune prevented the hackers from obtaining operational control of the flood gates because the dam had been manually disconnected for routine maintenance, she said.The indictment represents the Obama administration's latest attempt to more publicly confront cyber attacks carried out by other countries against the United States.“An important part of our cybersecurity practice is to identify the actors and to attribute them publicly when we can,"" Lynch said. ""We do this so that they know they cannot hide.”Though the indictment comes at a time of reduced tensions between the United States and Iran after a landmark 2015 nuclear deal, it is not expected that Iran will allow their extradition to the United States to face charges.FBI Director James Comey vowed to pursue justice, stating at the conference, ""the world is small, and our memory is long.""(Additional reporting by Susan Heavey, Megan Cassella and Julia Edwards in Washington and Jim Finkle in Boston; Editing by Kevin Drawbaugh and James Dalgleish)"
