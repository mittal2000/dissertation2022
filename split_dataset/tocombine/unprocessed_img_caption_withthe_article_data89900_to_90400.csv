While the months-long investigation singled out Patriots quarterback Tom Brady as being ""at least generally aware"" of the actions, here's what others around the league have had to say:Some responses were humorous:Some bemused:Some contemplative:Some exasperated:And some who weren't the least bit surprised:Water is wet https://t.co/LL1sN62DhLBack to being serious 1.

Wendy's International Inc.'s earnings dropped 1 percent in the second quarter but beat Wall Street's expectations for a period in which the third-largest hamburger chain's sales were hurt by false accusations that a woman found a finger in her chili. (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ec3b32100003000c60d84.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Vegetarians and vegans have traditionally had it pretty rough at most fast food restaurants. The menu at McDonald's, for example, includes only one entree without meat -- the Premium Southwest Salad -- and even that one has cheese on top. But now meat-averse customers have one more option, at least if they live in Ohio. The Columbus Dispatch reported on Saturday that Wendy's, which long offered no vegetarian-friendly entrees at all, started testing veggie burgers at two locations in Columbus a few weeks ago. The new veggie burgers are made mostly of black beans and come on ""a multigrain bun with pepperjack cheese, asiago ranch sauce, tomato, red onion and spring-mix greens,"" according to the Dispatch.A writer from Columbus Underground visited one of the participating Wendy's locations to try out the new veggie burger -- and liked it a lot, describing it as ""gorgeous"" and ""pleasant and savory."" That's high praise for any veggie burger, much less one from a fast food chain. Wendy's isn't the first fast food chain to serve a veggie burger. Burger King added them to the menu way back in 2002, while White Castle got in on the action this past December. Wendy's currently has no plans to bring the veggie burger to locations around the country, but if the test goes well, that could change quickly. Wendy's executives have been working on overhauling the brand since late 2011, aiming to position it somewhere between traditional fast food chains like McDonald's and Taco Bell and more upscale fast casual chains like Chipotle and Panera. And dishes like veggie burger, which appeal to health-conscious consumers, could help it move in that direction. UPDATE: Wendy's provided HuffPost with a photo of their new Black Bean Burger. It really is pretty!"
4,RELIGION,If the Pope Is Really Serious About Fair Pay Then He Should Make Altar Girls Mandatory,"Soraya Chemaly, ContributorFeminist, writer, and satirist (not always in that order)",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/if-the-pope-is-really-serious-about-fair-pay_b_7225128.html,"If Pope Francis really wants women to be paid fairly, there is something he can do today that would alter his culture in a disruptive and transformational way: he should make the appointment of altar girls a priority and begin the process of allowing women to be priests and cardinals.",2015-05-06,"Pope Francis speaks during a penitential ceremony on March 13, 2015 at St Peter's basilica in Vatican. Pope Francis declared an extraordinary jubilee year to celebrate the 50th anniversary of a landmark Vatican council and said the Church was bound to continue its reforming work. The year will be dedicated to the theme of mercy and begin on December 8th, the date the Vatican II council closed in 1965, Francis said in St Peter's cathedral on the second anniversary of his election as pope. AFP PHOTO / ALBERTO PIZZOLI (Photo credit should read ALBERTO PIZZOLI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb800aa220000bb01dd36c3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week, Pope Francis decried the international gender pay gap as a ""pure scandal"" that good Christians need to do something about. It was refreshing to hear him say that sexist attitudes about gender and work are a kind of ""machismo"" based on men wanting ""to dominate women."" The Pope may want women to be paid more fairly, however, this does not a feminist make. While he is lauded as a champion of liberalization, he draws a firm line at girls and women. He is the head of the largest and most influential fraternities in the world and has no plans to disrupt its sex-based legacy. The steps necessary to achieve women's economic parity are significantly inhibited by Catholic policies and beliefs about complementary roles for men and women, the outcome of which is widespread gender-based injustice.If Pope Francis really wants women to be paid fairly, there is something he can do today that would alter his culture in a disruptive and transformational way: he should make the appointment of altar girls a priority and begin the process of allowing women to be priests and cardinals. It would be nice if he publicly recognized the ways in which the Church's policies on women's reproductive rights significantly impair women's health, economic wellbeing and long-term financial and physical security. These steps, as likely as a blinding snowstorm hitting Tahiti today, would signal a profound commitment to women's equality.Why start with altar girls? Because what families see and do in their places of worship, at the direction of men they're told have power over their eternal lives, shapes people and has a butterfly effect in society and institutions. Children's ambitions, expectations, capabilities, confidence and sense of what constitutes fairness and justice are tied to how they are treated by their families and their religions.Once every few years since 1994, the year when the Catholic Church first allowed altar girls, the issue of banning them returns. Take, for example, this year when Joseph Illo, a San Francisco priest, announced the barring of girls from Catholic services in his diocese. He gave many good reasons for doing this in a public statement. He explained, that boys lose interest because girls do a better job; the role of altar boy is tied to an all-male priesthood, so it makes no sense to have altar girls; being an altar boy is what sparks a desire to be a priest so boys need to do it; and, go on, read it, girls distract the boys who are meant to serve. Altar girls are, in effect, the religious equivalent of a gateway drug.The argument articulated by Illo, a standard one, was also made by Raymond Burke, a conservative American Cardinal in Rome. Burke likes to throw around the word ""feminized,"" in a very traditional, pejorative way.What does he mean? There are no official women priests and no women are allowed in the senior hierarchy of the Vatican. There are no women in position of power or authority in the Church who do not report to a man. There are barely any in the Vatican itself. At last count, out of the city-state's roughly 550 citizens, 32 were women -- 1 nun and 31 lay women. Roughly 82 percent of employees of the Holy See are men and just two women work as undersecretaries in the Vatican. There is also the growing influence of the ultra secretive and conservative lay organization, Opus Dei, known for conservative sex segregation and even more extreme, gender hierarchical practices. One of the few exceptions to the exclusion of women in senior, influential roles used to be the significant number of women who served as presidents of Catholic colleges and universities, a number that exceeded women's representation in non-Catholic schools. (The majority of Catholic colleges were founded by women religious orders and were sex-segregated. Once desegregation began, women lost ground. Not one woman has been named president in the increasing trend of hiring lay people to head up Catholic colleges and universities.)Catholics are no more or less blind to sexism than other people, most of whom overlook sexism. However, in the case of an all-male priesthood, the not seeing is striking. In 2003, a study, ""Is the Roman Catholic Prohibition of Female Priests Sexist?: How Catholic College Students Think about Women's Ordination and Sexism,"" completed at Loyola University, found that most Catholic students disagreed with the statement ""Women should not be allowed to be clergy (priests, pastors, imams, rabbis, etc."" At the same time, they overwhelming agreed that ""Sexism is wrong."" Researchers were amazed that the respondents saw no relationship between the two.Given that most people don't recognize sexism, discrimination on the basis of sex, until it's revealed as such...Thing 1: Barring girls from serving at altars and women from being priests is sexismThing 2: Traditional sexism is still sexism.Thing 3: Religious sexism is still sexism.The Church maintains that it is not sexist, that it, indeed, abhors sexism. Instead, women have important, uniquely female roles in the faith and are respected for those roles. The church maintains that priesthood, not a right but a male calling, has nothing to do with power, but is about submission. And yet, somehow, it is women who are expected to submit to men, the way men are expected to submit to God.Complementarianism, the belief in equal but separate and complementary roles for men and women, is a primary reason we have a pay gap and an unbalanced distribution of labor, including whose is considered important. The pay gap starts in homes and churches, between parents and with children; between priests and their constituents. People go from these places and take their beliefs with them into the workplace.For example, studies, such as ""Marriage Structure and Resistance to the Gender Revolution in the Workplace,"" repeatedly show that men with stay-at-home wives are markedly hostile to women's success and leadership in the workplace. A woman working for a man with a stay at home wife has reduced chances of getting a promotion, being paid fairly or getting a raise. A survey of 1,200 executives conducted by Families and Work Institute revealed that 75 percent of the men had stay-at-home wives. I'd bet a fair amount of money that the numbers for political representatives (also roughly 83 percent male, more for state representation and governorships) are similar.Of the Fortune 1000 only 14.3 percent have female board members. People managing boards, businesses and companies are overwhelmingly men (84 percent).In traditional families with fathers as heads of households and ultimate arbiters of decisions, there are clear imbalances in how chores are assigned and how allowances are distributed. There are also imbalances in whose public speech and authority are legitimized, critically important dimensions of work life and success.When girls go to Catholic churches where there are no women priests (or similarly, rabbis or imams) they learn to be quiet. They are taught, through thousands of small interactions, language and rules, that their words cannot and do not have power and that access to God has to be mediated always through boys and men. Their eternal salvation depends on men who are granted authority, and disproportionate responsibilities. They learn that some humans are more closely created in God's image and that they are not among them. They learn that expectations about self-control and sacrifice and authority are gendered and imbalanced. When they are told to step down so that boys cannot be distracted or shown up, they learn that their abilities and desires must be sublimated so that boys' abilities and desires can be prioritized and fulfilled.Boys learn these things as well, and also get very different messages. They learn that they are special by comparison. They learn to act and speak publicly. They learn to be authoritative and that they are deserving of public respect. They learn that their words and work have power and public value and that they have a unique, compared to their sisters, relationship with those who wield it. They learn that the society that they live in values what they have to say, because they are boys saying it. They learn that they will not be held accountable for their actions. They learn that their needs have primacy. They learn that they can gain status and privilege by socially sanctioned discrimination. They may be expected to submit to God, but girls and women are expected to submit to them. Really, don't listen to me, just read Illo's statement.All over the world, attitudes, beliefs and practices such as these are why we have an enduring pay gap. If people think that women ""make choices"" that lead to this gap, at the very least they should acknowledge that they are doing it subject to socialized constraints that degrade both men and women's autonomy. This obviously isn't uniquely a Catholic problem, but the Church has the choice to be part of the solution and the Vatican is rejecting to do so.The shining lights in this situation are American activist nuns and Catholic women priests, who run their own churches. There are now more than 100 ordained women priests in the United States.That and the fact that the Church hierarchy really doesn't represent most Catholics in terms of practical day to day life. Barring altar girls, however, is more than just vestigial sexism, it's obstructionist and grounded in misogynistic ideas. A Church genuinely committed to addressing the needs of the marginalized would startwith the ordination of women, not end here, centuries from now. The problem for the Church isn't girls who stay, it's the girls they turn away, each of whom realizes she is, for no legitimate moral or ethical reason, not respected as an equal, regardless of what the Pope says. As long as girls have to fight to be recognized in their own churches the Pope's protestations ring hollow. In the meantime, every altar girl this Church turns away is a gift to the rest of the world. Those girls, and the people who support them, are the ones who will eventually close the pay gap.Portions of this essay have been published in Whatever Works: Feminists of Faith Speak,  Trista Hendren (Editor), Pat Daly (Editor), Amina Wadud (Foreword)"

During the day the news focused on positive culture, associating the city with flowers, folklore, and music. But at night the theme changed to urban warfare waged by the paramilitaries and the guerrillas on the dangerous hills of Medellin.On several occasions I unsuccessfully went in search of exclusive interviews with the guerrillas and paramilitaries. It was hard to penetrate the dreaded areas to which neither the police nor the army entered. The hills surrounding Medellin are home to thousands of innocent families, and back then the area had become a blood zone.I allude to that experience because in 2007 I had the opportunity to return to Medellin, not as a reporter but as a tourist; and was surprised to see that from a cable car I could see the same houses and hills that were once used as trenches. The place had become vibrant and colorful, but the poverty still showed through the rusty metal ceilings and the clothes hanging to dry on wires. No longer were rifles or gunshots heard in the streets. I saw a community that was proud of its poverty and limitations.In that same cable car I crossed an old combat zone that then led to a beautiful natural park. This means of transportation is part of a larger urban development plan, which was embedded in the areas of Medellin where the poorest live. There are now libraries, museums, parks, schools and botanical gardens. All this was built with the intention of returning dignity to a community that had lost everything.I recently had the pleasure to meet the man in charge of the social revolution in Medellin, Sergio Fajardo, at New York's Colombian Education Fund. He is a mathematics professor turned politician, who is now enabling the poor to overcome poverty through the doors of education.I see Sergio Fajardo as a humanist, a man who really cares about the poor, and a mathematician who used logic to study the equation of inequality. That is why he first devoted his career to be mayor of Medellin, and is now the Governor of Antioquia, finding a formula that will allow the community to restore its dignity and improve its quality of life.Fajardo is known internationally: partly because during his time as mayor he reduced the levels of violence in Medellin by 90 percent, and also because he has won international awards. His administration has always maintained the premise that ""the most beautiful must be for the most poor.""""Corruption in Colombia is a criminal enterprise, more difficult to combat than the guerrillas and criminal gangs,"" Fajardo said during our interview, ""There are gateways to the world of illegality, corruption, and drug trafficking. They exist in all societies but are particularly big in Antioquia. My goal is to close these and simultaneously open other doors of opportunity through education.""Sergio Fajardo, 58, is from a generation that has lived in war constantly; but despite that, he deeply believes in building peace. He said he wants the end of the war through the negotiations that are taking place in La Havana, Cuba between the Colombian government and the terrorist group, Farc. ""I want the peace process to yield fruit. That is a big challenge for Colombia. But it can be done and I want it done. The pages of violence are full...full of tears, fear, and death. How many victims do we have? Antioquia has more than 1,200,000 victims! That's enough! We must tread these pages lightly to not repeat history....we have to forgive but never forget.""Fajardo admitted that he is willing to pursue the Presidency of the Republic of Colombia. He said the possibility is wide open, but for now he has to focus on finishing his work as Governor of the province of Antioquia. ""This is a project involving many people. There are many efforts needed. Pursuing the Presidency is a possibility. I already have experience from 2010, when I ran for Vice President, and the likelihood that I will return is high.""Sergio Fajardo will finish his job as Governor before the end of 2015. He will then take a sabbatical from work to write his book, From Mathematician to Politician."

Not surprisingly, its profits have skyrocketed in recent years as the elderly population grows, with a Forbes' article recently calling home health care franchises among the hottest investments and noting that the number of such franchises has more than quadrupled since 2000.What most people don't know is that the exclusion of home health care workers from fair pay is a deliberate and racist wrong that stretches back to Depression-era America, where it was written into our nation's labor law to accommodate Southern segregationists. When the Fair Labor Standards Act was enacted as part of the New Deal, it excluded home health care workers, along with other domestic workers, from the otherwise broad guarantees of minimum wages and overtime pay. This exclusion was a legacy of the American original sin of slavery, during which many enslaved African-American women who didn't work the fields were forced to provide unpaid household care for white families. Following emancipation, in the Jim Crow era, former slaves and their descendants were kept out of good-paying industries through a toxic combination of legal, unofficial, and violent means. Even those who avoided the oppressive sharecropping system were pushed into the worst jobs, becoming bellboys and porters if they were men and domestics in white households if they were women. The low value placed on domestic work was also rooted in sex stereotypes that viewed this work as something less than real work, deeming it unworthy of legal protections. These gender norms were racialized: White women were expected to leave the paid workforce upon marriage to care for their own families, while Black women were expected to care for white families for low wages and without protections from abuse, even as they were frequently criticized for neglecting their own children.When the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act was passed, guaranteeing minimum wages and standardizing hours, it codified these biases into law. The statute was deliberately interpreted to exclude domestic workers as well as agricultural workers -- many of whom were African-American and immigrant men -- the very occupations once performed in bondage. It also excluded a range of other predominantly female and non-white occupations, like hotel workers, waitresses, chambermaids, and janitors and nurses in hospitals from its safety net. The Southern segregationist legislators who controlled many leadership positions in the New Deal Congress, and who voted as a bloc, insisted upon this purposeful exclusion of so many African-American workers, not only from the Fair Labor Standards Act but from the rest of the New Deal's enactments, including Social Security. There was nothing covert about their aims.Members of Congress stood up during the debates over the Fair Labor Standards Act to argue that ""you cannot prescribe the same wages for the black man as for the white man,"" as Democratic Rep. Martin Dies of Texas put it. Rep. J. Mark Wilcox, a Democrat from Florida, cast the matter as one of reality in the South: ""You cannot put the Negro and the white man on the same basis and get away with it,"" he said. ""[I]t just will not work in the South."" The only remotely covert part of the whole sordid deal was the race-neutral language of the legal exclusions themselves -- as scholars like Juan Perea and Roy L. Brooks have documented, excluding the occupations where Black Americans were forced to work without mentioning race overtly. By using the well-recognized proxies of agricultural and domestic workers, New Deal legislators were able to garner needed Southern support without alienating northern votes.Despite the use of these barely-coded categories, their meaning was apparent to all. The NAACP, the National Negro Congress, and other groups protested the exclusion of domestic servants and farmworkers from New Deal laws like the Social Security Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act. They pointed out, as the NAACP's Charles Hamilton Houston testified, that ""you will find the majority of Negroes engaged either in farming or else in domestic service,"" and thus shut out of the new laws' protections. But time and again, Congress ignored their testimony and codified the racial exclusions into federal law.Congress eventually amended the Fair Labor Standards Act in 1974 to bring most domestic workers within its protections, but the law was still interpreted by the Labor Department to exclude most home health care workers. In the decades since then, the home health care industry has exploded into a multi-million-dollar sector. Part of this massive growth is due to the welcome fact that, unlike in decades past, many more people who need care are now living in their homes, rather than in institutions. In addition, the portion of the population that is 65 or older has burgeoned, from 8 percent in 1950 to nearly 13 percent by 2009. Yet the growing workforce providing care is still working under pre-1938 conditions, with no guarantee of minimum pay or overtime.After years of advocacy by a broad coalition that included worker and civil rights groups, the Department of Labor issued rules in 2013 that would finally bring home health care workers into the economic mainstream and grant them the basic wage protections that most workers take for granted. The rules require workers employed by third-party agencies, which make up the vast majority of the workers in the marketplace, to be paid minimum wages and overtime. They also narrow the definition of the casual babysitters and elder companions who would remain exempt from wage protections.Early this year, however, a federal judge in the District of Columbia struck down the rules as being beyond the scope of the Labor Department's authority. The ruling was prompted by a legal challenge brought by those who gain the most from the exclusion of home health care workers from wage protections -- the home health care industry, represented by their trade associations, the Home Care Association of America, the International Franchise Association, and the National Association for Home Care and Hospice. The industry groups argued, and the federal judge agreed, that the Labor Department lacks the power to eliminate the exemptions for home health care workers, and that any change to the status quo would have to come from further congressional action. The government has appealed, and the federal court of appeals will hear the case on May 7.It was never right to deny predominantly non-white women workers fair wages for the difficult work they do providing care at home. It is certainly not right today. The federal government has finally acted to put a long-overdue end to this shameful legal exemption that the home health care industry has unjustly benefited from. Now it's time for the courts to do the same and stop these firms from profiting from a loophole rooted in the racist legacies of slavery and Jim Crow."

Worldwide levels of the chief greenhouse gas that causes global warming have hit a milestone, reaching an amount never before encountered by humans, federal scientists said Friday, May 10, 2013. Carbon dioxide was measured at 400 parts per million at the oldest monitoring station in Hawaii which sets the global benchmark. The last time the worldwide carbon level was probably that high was about 2 million years ago, said Pieter Tans of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb169c42000009900ffa371.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Average global levels of carbon dioxide stayed above 400 parts per million, or ppm, through all of March 2015 -- the first time that has happened for an entire month since record keeping first began, according to data released this week by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).Scientists with NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory have called the news a ""significant milestone"" in the growing scourge of man-made climate change.“This marks the fact that humans burning fossil fuels have caused global carbon dioxide concentrations to rise more than 120ppm since pre-industrial times,” Pieter Tans, lead scientist of NOAA's greenhouse gas network, told The Guardian on Wednesday. “Half of that rise has occurred since 1980.”In May 2013, atmospheric levels of CO2 topped a daily average of 400 ppm for the first time. Some parts of the planet were consistently above the mark for most of last summer, and the entirety of the Northern Hemisphere hit the threshold in May 2014.Average greenhouse gas levels haven't been this high since between 800,000 and 15 million years ago, according to Climate Central.The 400 ppm mark doesn't actually mean much in and of itself -- there's little difference, for example, between the effects of a 395 ppm reading and those of a 405 ppm reading, as The Huffington Post's Kate Sheppard reported last year. Still, this week's news stands as an irrefutable reminder that our planet is going through a process that could eventually cause harm to countless numbers of people.""When you focus on the fact that it's moving through thresholds like that, you get an appreciation for how it's actually changing,"" Ralph Keeling, director of the CO2 program at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego, said at the time. ""It's a wake-up call about how much we've already changed the atmosphere.""Jamie Henn, co-founder and communications director for the advocacy group 350.org, told HuffPost on Wednesday that benchmarks like these are an ""urgent signal that we need to leave fossil fuels in the ground.""""This may not be our climate rubicon, but we're certainly standing on the shores of disaster,"" Henn told HuffPost in an emailed statement. ""400 ppm is well past the point of safety which many scientists put at 350 ppm.""Carbon emissions actually stabilized in 2014 for the first time in over 40 years, due in large part to the widespread adoption of cheaper renewable technologies around the globe. But last year was still the hottest in 135 years of record keeping, and public opinion about climate change still lags behind the science. Most conservative Republicans don't think climate change is happening at all, and 70 percent don't agree that humans are the cause.However, among scientists who have expressed a position on the issue, 97 percent agree that not only is climate change happening, but humans are the ones causing it."

In the face of the largest known Ebola outbreak in modern history, and with limited protective gear, Alvin knew he risked his own health with every new patient he treated. Yet, he kept working, right up until he contracted Ebola himself.  On November 12, 2014, Alvin the healer became Alvin the patient. He was the first person admitted to the Monrovia Medical Unit (MMU), a 25-bed hospital operated by Commissioned Corps officers of the U.S. Public Health Service. For nearly six months, these brave Americans treated health care workers who may have become infected with the Ebola virus while responding to the current outbreak. That was their mission. I had the privilege of meeting Alvin and members of ""Team Four,"" the last team of Commissioned Corps officers to staff the MMU. Last week, I joined them in Monrovia as we transitioned equipment and resources from the MMU to the Government of Liberia. I was also fortunate to have met Liberia's unflappable President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf and U.S. Ambassador Deborah R. Malac.President Sirleaf told me that having our public health officers stand up and manage the MMU was a critical signal to international relief workers that the U.S. would care for them if they got sick. I heard this sentiment echoed by numerous international organizations, as well. Our presence in Liberia bolstered global confidence in the effort and spurred a number of countries to send volunteers to assist with the Ebola response throughout West Africa.But our role in Liberia was about more than dealing with the crisis in front of us. It was also about building and expanding the capacity of Liberian health care workers, ensuring that they would not only be better equipped to fight Ebola, but that they would be able to address the health care needs of their people going forward. The MMU became a ""force multiplier,"" creating a positive dynamic that should benefit the region for years to come.Over the past six months, a rotation of four teams of Commissioned Corps officers were deployed away from their families and their homes to provide life-saving care for people they'd never met before. And, although officers deploy when called upon, members of these teams - and literally thousands of Corps officers -- volunteered even before official orders were released. That's because they realized this is the very sort of event for which they joined the Corps. It's what they train for.As several officers told me, it was a privilege for them to serve in this critical mission. In this effort -- as in the Corps' 217-year history -- our USPHS officers proved themselves to be the true guardians of global public health.  On the last day of my trip, I joined President Sirleaf, Ambassador Malac and Commissioned Corps officers to hand over the resources of the MMU to the Government of Liberia. Alvin was there. He spoke about his journey. As we talked, I couldn't help but think how Alvin embodied the words on the sign outside that hospital, ""Today I am healed. Tomorrow I return to heal another.""When the world was afraid, we came to Liberia to offer help, healing and hope. When our neighbors needed us the most, we opened our hearts and extended our hands in service.This is not just about Ebola. It's about the next epidemic and the one after that. We leave Liberia stronger than we found it.I look forward to the ""Magic Day"" (as President Sirleaf calls it) when Liberia will be declared Ebola-free. And I am so pleased to welcome home our public health heroes with a continued appreciation for their commitment to service and to the health and well-being of our world.Dr. Murthy is the 19th Surgeon General of the United States and serves as Vice Admiral of the U.S. Public Health Service, leading nearly 6,700 Commissioned Corps officers serving in 800 locations around the world."

In the video, a youngster about eight years old was skating down the ice and about to shoot a shot into the opposing team's goal. He missed the shot and all of a sudden a man stands up and yells at the top of his voice, ""Aaron, you bum, you can never do anything right!"" The man was Aaron's father.I said to the TV host, ""Well, thank goodness that doesn't happen all the time, but I can tell you in my more than 40 years of experience in youth sports that it is the type of behavior you see all too often in kids sports."" But not in other events for kids.I continued by saying, ""Can you imagine going to one of your child's piano recitals and right in the middle of their performance the child hits a bad note and the father stands up and yells, 'What a stupid idiot!

Relaxing just isn't in the cards.When the sport of soccer was introduced to kids in this country, the parents would drop the kids off and go sit somewhere in the park and chat while the game went on. Nobody knew the rules so, in turn, nobody cared. It was just a game.Then all of a sudden the parents began to know the rules a little better and instead of chatting somewhere far from the field they began to venture over to sit in the stands. The next thing you know they were, for the most part, standing along the sidelines shouting all kinds of guttural sounds in attempts to tell their kids how to play better. I'll never forget going to a game and on one side of the field I saw a father throw his son against a fence for making a mistake and a mother running up and down on the other side of the field screaming at her son to ""Hustle! Hustle!""While sports psychologists give all types of reasons for this type of behavior, I have yet to hear one talk about how to prevent it. One thing we do at the National Alliance for Youth Sports is to show videos of parents' behavior. Nothing is more shocking to the parent who says, ""Oh my God.

10,SPORTS,Economists: NCAA's Latest Argument Against Paying Players Is ‘Nonsense',Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ncaa-pay-players-student-athletes_n_7207860.html,The NCAA's latest scare tactic appears error-ridden.,2015-05-05,"FILE - In this March 21, 2013, file photo, in this image taken with a fisheye lens, the NCAA logo is displayed at mid-court before Albany's practice for a second-round game of the NCAA college basketball tournament in Philadelphia. Barely a month ago, the NCAA was shamed into apologizing for trying to rig its own investigation into funny business at the University of Miami. According to a new report, that apology didn't go nearly far enough. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb77d542600003001835143.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The NCAA is brandishing a new weapon in its fight against paying student-athletes: an argument that doing so would lead to a reduction in the number of scholarships that “many -- if not most --” Division I schools would be able to offer. In court documents filed last week and dug up by CBS Sports reporter Jon Solomon, the NCAA and 11 top conferences argued that paying star college basketball and football players would likely lead to a significant reduction in the number of scholarships they are able to offer lesser players on both the men’s and women’s side. The argument was made in defense of lawsuits that challenge the NCAA’s financial model. But when The Huffington Post talked to three prominent sports economists, all of them questioned the logic of the argument, saying it sounded dubious at best and obviously incorrect at worst. “That’s nonsense. They have all the money,” David Berri, a professor of economics at Southern Utah University, told HuffPost. “The money exists. They can pay them. It’s ridiculous to say that they wouldn’t be able to pay them.”“The argument that ending restrictions in the labor market will lead to lower levels of employment seems unlikely on the face of it,” Stefan Szymanski, a sports economist working in the sport management department at the University of Michigan, said. Most of the NCAA’s member institutions barely break even or lose money -- the NCAA itself says only 20 of its 1,1000 schools make more than they spend on sports -- but the schools are non-profits, which means they have an incentive to spend all the money the pull in, rather than rake in excess revenue. So no matter how much money the NCAA generates, it will always look like any extra costs -- say, from paying players -- would push programs over the edge and maybe even leave some student-athletes out to dry. But that’s simply a function of a system that is set up in a way that makes the NCAA appear as if it is always just barely scraping by, despite big-time money in the form of ticket sales, TV deals and many other revenue sources. (The NCAA brought in nearly $1 billion in revenue on its own in its most recent fiscal year, and many athletic programs bring in tens of millions on their own as well.)David Carter, executive director of the USC Marshall Sports Business Institute, told me over the phone that he feared paying student-athletes would lead to cuts in other areas. “Where are you going to get that [theoretical] one million dollars?” he asked.But Rodney Fort, a sports economist and professor of sports management at the University of Michigan, told HuffPost that, should athletic departments need to reshuffle resources to compensate players, he expects that the schools would first pull money from the pool of money presently dedicated to coaches’ salaries, athletic directors’ salaries and new facilities before they took away athletic scholarships.""There will be fewer scholarships if athletes wish to pay their own way. Otherwise not,” Fort wrote in an email. “Much more likely is that salaries to coaches and [athletic directors] will fall, and so will spending on facilities for athletes.” (For its part, the NCAA called this line of reasoning “economic nonsense” in its court filing, arguing that head coaches’ salaries are high not because of excess revenue, but because professional head coaches’ salaries are high, and so schools must pay in-demand college coaches at professional levels to attract and retain them.)There are two other major ways athletic directors could cover the additional costs associated with paying athletes, according to Szymanski: one, they could raise prices; and two, they could obtain more money from the university.And Szymanski and Fort said two separate factors from those would convince schools to continue to offer scholarships to those who the athletic department deemed worth it: the schools’ desire to win and the athletic directors’ desire to keep their jobs. “As long as the number of players required remains the same, and injuries are equally probable, and colleges want to win, then they will need to offer incentives at every level of talent, not just the top end,” Szymanski wrote. Fort added. “Any AD [athletic director] that bucks this will just lose talent to ADs that meet athlete demands.""There is precedent for the NCAA's reasoning. A similar argument was made in England during the 19th century, when it was argued there was a fixed pool of money available for labor at any one time. According to the economic concept, known as the wage fund theory, adding more people to the labor pool theoretically meant less money available per person (or in the NCAA's case, giving some people a raise means less scholarship money for others).But in practice, the wage fund theory was “shown to be a fallacy by the end of the 19th century,” Szymanski said. “Had it not been, then rapidly rising population in the 19th century would have led to mass starvation.” It didn’t.Regardless of wonky economics arguments, the idea that there is a finite amount of scholarship money available for student-athletes is false logic anyway, Berri said. “We give scholarships to people in all sort of things that have nothing to do with generating revenue,” Berri noted, citing music and academic scholarships as two of the most common. “So this is utterly ridiculous.""""We don’t say this for any [other type of other scholarship],"" he said. The NCAA told HuffPost it could not comment due to ongoing litigation."

(AP Photo),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb29026200000e500fff4d4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What we make of the Rorschach test's blotchy black ink supposedly says a lot about us.Created in the early 1920s by a surprisingly attractive Swiss man named Hermann Rorschach, the set of 10 cards gained widespread popularity with clinical psychologists by the 1940s, becoming as synonymous with the field as leather sofas and bespectacled white guys in sweater vests. (Yes, the over 90-year-old set of blots is still in use, although there's a lot of debate over its accuracy.)Then, in the early 1980s, notorious pop artist Andy Warhol created a series called ""Rorschach."" In liquid monochromes, Warhol crafted his own ""ink blots"" on massive canvases (so that they'd cost more, probably). But he got one crucial thing wrong about his subject matter. He thought that patients were actually supposed to create ink blots for psychologists to decode -- not the other way around. He even thought about paying someone to decode his own blots, but never got around to it.“I thought that when you went to places like hospitals, they tell you to draw and make the Rorschach tests. I wish I’d known there was a set,"" Warhol later explained. But it was an unintentionally genius move. The paintings put an egalitarian spin on stuffy abstract painting, critic Mia Fineman argues in a post on artnet.com. In line with Warhol's special ability to blur highbrow and lowbrow, the series asks each viewer to play the psychologist, analyzing each splotch of symmetrically swirling paint. Critic Rosalind E. Krauss goes a step further, suggesting Warhol's Rorschach blobs parody abstract art. Rotating the ink blots vertically makes us see a lot more, um, private areas of the human body on the canvas, reminding us ""there is no form so 'innocent' (or abstract) that it can ever avoid the corruption of a pejorative interpretation,"" Krauss wrote in an essay titled ""Carnal Knowledge.""So, go ahead and interpret as you please -- is it a pair of antlers? A vagina? A mermaid jumping over a bear? Viewers, it's all up to you. "

Teachers who helped me delve into myself to discover what those dreams were, what I was passionate about and how to make my mark on the world. These teachers intentionally or unintentionally played a part in the person I am today. Below are a few who really shaped me and became unintentional mentors over the years.Andrew Carle - George Mason University (Fairfax, VA) I met Professor Carle my junior year of college. On the first day of class, he mentioned he didn't post lecture notes until after class, contingent on at least 90% class attendance. This wasn't an idle threat; he meant it and the first couple weeks, everyone showed up to take notes on the off chance we were short. After the first few weeks, I wasn't attending class out of fear of missing notes I needed for the final; I was attending because he taught the class in a way that made me want to learn and gain every ounce of knowledge he was giving. As the semester came to a close, I jumped at the shot to take another class with him, and that class was a game-changer. Assisted living management was not a field I had considered, but Professor Carle unintentionally taught me to go out and try things because you never know where your passion lies. He also taught me that if you're passionate about your work it'll show. His passion for the elderly and their care was on full display every day. He showed us that if you're passionate about your work, you genuinely do a better job. Dr. Catherine Wright - George Mason University (Fairfax, VA) Dr. Wright was one of my first college professors. I walked in her class my freshmen year not knowing what to expect, and left it with a vast array of communication/public speaking skills as well as a new found love for a charity I still hold near and dear to my heart. Dr. Wrights' teachings benefited me for the rest of my college years and into my professional career. For the final, she had everyone research a charity of their choosing and do a persuasive speech. This is where I found out about Save the Children and found myself drawn to wanting to help them. Junior year, I wanted to take that desire to help a step further and Dr. Wright was the first person I thought of to be my faculty advisor and create an organization on campus that would raise funds for STC. She helped me find the drive within me to make this happen. She was always there to offer assistance and advice whenever needed, and she made me discover leadership qualities I never knew I had. She showed me that if you have a passion and a drive to make something happen, hard work and dedication will get you there and to never give up on your dreams. Zarmina Hotaki - Al Qalam Academy (Springfield, VA) I attended a small private school for high school, and having the same teacher for a specific subject every year was not out of the norm. Ms. Zarmina was my English teacher throughout high school. Her classes illustrated the power of words and how they can illicit emotions and feelings. But it was her psychology background I benefited from the most. I was a rebellious teenager always wanting to do the opposite of what I was told. I was hard-headed, breaking rules, etc. she showed me how to turn that rebellious energy into something positive: become independent, more self-reliant and more resilient. Those qualities have gotten me through major life changes and forced me to chase my dreams. Whoever she's teaching these days I hope they benefit as much as I did. Teachers play a big role in shaping who you become. A good teacher knows how to empower his/her students to become the people they are meant to be and make their mark on the world. I couldn't be more grateful for the teachers who have entered my life and helped to shape me into the person I am. They gave me the skills needed to do what I want and the strength to follow through on my dreams. Thank you to every teacher that played a part and helped me to stand firmly where I am today.Become part of the conversation and tell us about your own favorite teacher using the hashtag #HPHeartsTeachers on Twitter and Facebook."

Adopting a healthy lifestyle that not only focused on physical health but mental health and fitness is what made a difference for me, and that meant having conversations with myself that were very challenging, and understanding that everything takes time. While we celebrate the positive shift in conversation as it applies to beauty, my hope is that we will not simply shift the definition of beauty from one narrow box to another, and that we take the time to understand that beauty is more than the curve or lack thereof, and more about the people we choose to be.Nancy Laws on The Blog"

17,WOMEN,She's Got a New Title: Chief Medical Officer,"Lynn Vos, ContributorCEO at greyhealth group",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shes-got-a-new-title-chief-medical-officer_b_7183194.html,"A new study's key findings make clear that women are now overwhelmingly the healthcare decision makers for both themselves and their families.

Look no further than the results of a recent multi-market survey of 9,200 respondents in the U.S., UK, Germany, Japan and Brazil titled ""The Power of the Purse: Engaging Women Decision Makers for Healthy Outcomes."" Conducted by The Center for Talent Innovation, led by Carolyn Buck-Luce, I recently had the pleasure of serving with nearly 90 industry leaders on this important primary research initiative.The study's key findings make clear that women are now overwhelmingly the healthcare decision makers for both themselves and their families. They are setting healthcare agendas, making treatment decisions, selecting healthcare coverage and providers. Regardless of marital status or whether they have children, 94 percent make decisions for themselves and 59 percent make healthcare decisions for others.Ninety four percent of working moms of children under age 18 make decisions for othersThis finding probably comes as no surprise to most women. But it is satisfying to finally have definitive proof about the role we play. Meet the new boss.The study indicates that we women take this ""Chief Medical Officer (CMO)"" role very seriously. Fully 73 percent of respondents indicated that it is very important to them to be knowledgeable about keeping themselves and their loved ones healthy. And yet, it is a role that a healthy majority of women feel ill equipped to do. Nearly 60 percent say they are lacking confidence in their decision making. Why? The study results strongly suggest that women are starved for healthcare knowledge. They don't know what information -- mostly accessed online -- to believe or trust. In addition, they are starved for time and trust in their insurance providers and pharmaceutical companies. This challenging CMO dichotomy adds up to huge opportunity across the healthcare arena -- medical schools, payers, pharmaceutical companies, nursing, product marketers, executive leadership, talent managers, etc. For improving healthcare outcomes. For improving the bottom line. IF female ""famines"" can be properly addressed. For starters, that means healthcare professionals and organizations need to change their current male-centric thinking. Women view health more broadly than the usual definition of freedom from illness. Nearly 80 percent of the CMOs in the study defined health as ""having spiritual and emotional well-being."" Almost the same sample also cited ""being physically fit and well rested."" The CMO perspective needs to be baked into marketing, clinical trial design, boardroom decision-making and more, especially direct communication. But most important, the study indicates healthcare providers and organizations must change their behaviors in order to build trust that can lead to empowered CMO engagement. Women were asked what behaviors they found most satisfying from these entities. At the heart of every answer is improved, two-way dialogue and clear messaging that are sensitive to the female perspective.And while the industry needs to step up its game, so do women when it comes to caring for themselves. The study disturbingly found that a full 78 percent of working women with children under 18 believe they don't have enough time to maintain their health. Lack of time is an easy culprit to blame. And a bit foolish. Like ignoring the instructions for using oxygen masks on airplanes. Women simply can't keep shortchanging themselves if they are to be successful care coordinators for their families. The phrase ""women first"" comes to mind.The ""Power of the Purse"" study offers an insightful blueprint for successful CMO engagement at the highest levels of healthcare organizations, throughout the marketplace and at the point of care. We marketing communications professionals have a golden opportunity to translate these findings into meaningful messaging and tools -- and prove further that communications is the cure. By working together, all sectors of the healthcare arena can contribute to properly preparing women to be effective, even revolutionary, healthcare advocates.

18,QUEER VOICES,We Welcome Bruce Jenner With Open Arms -- But He's Not Our Standard Bearer,"Laura A.

His acceptance is only possible because of the courage of those who resisted at Stonewall, and the countless others who have rebelled against intolerance while simply attempting to be the people they felt themselves to be. They are our heroes and heroines.",2015-05-05,"PALOS VERDES ESTATES, CA - SEPTEMBER 29: Bruce Jenner arrives for Ryan Sheckler's 7th Annual Celebrity Golf Tournament at Trump National Golf Course on September 29, 2014 in Palos Verdes Estates, California. (Photo by Gabriel Olsen/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafdb0b2200005700db2526.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The interview is over and the dust has settled, a tad -- maybe now everyone can have a tiny bit of perspective.The transgender and gender nonconforming community (though we are hardly a single, homogenous group), respects Bruce's coming out. We recognize that he revealed himself to everyday America and is trying, as best he can, to control his narrative and to provide a learning opportunity. We have nothing but sympathy for his lifelong shame and dysphoria (the profound unease with one's body suffered by many transgender and gender nonconforming individuals), and wish him the easiest transition possible. He has been portrayed as the long-awaited hero who will assume the mantle of leadership, and maybe Bruce does seem like a trailblazer to outsiders. The interview was probably the first exposure to our issues for many in the general public. Diane Sawyer offered a compassionate and comprehensive glimpse into Jenner's experience; in doing so, she attempted to address some of the most common questions outsiders have. Ultimately the interview showed that transgender people are, beneath the stereotypes, people. And it might even have changed some minds.   Meanwhile, mainstream media pundits offer stories of how Jenner is someone behind which my community is eager to unite. Those journalists get it wrong. The situation is far more complicated. I have spoken with peers, clients, and many others about Jenner. My New York City-centric sample may be biased, but I think we have a very different interpretation of the current moment. Bruce stands on the shoulders of those before. His acceptance is only possible because of the courage of those who resisted at Stonewall, and the countless others who have rebelled against intolerance while simply attempting to be the people they felt themselves to be. They are our heroes and heroines. Also, Bruce is not Ellen. In 1997, the LGBT community was desperate for a role model and eagerly anticipated her announcement; there was a palpable electricity. We loved her, and everyone felt kinship immediately.But we awaited the Jenner interview with dread. Though the result was somewhat better than expected, now we are at best ambivalent. It offered an older narrative of transgender identity, one no longer as representative as it once was: someone with money, transitioning male-to-female, Caucasian, aware from very young and having suffered lasting shame, who cycled through several interrupted beginnings, feeling they were truly the ""other"" gender due to a body/brain mismatch and needing transition to become their authentic self. (Nevermind that no evidence has yet been found for the biological links suggested in the interview.) Someone who seems to identify and wants to present in gender-typical ways. It is a narrative heard 40 years ago from Renée Richards, and 20 before that from Christine Jorgensen. To us he seems dated; we now have increasingly nuanced and expansive expressions of gender both inside and outside the gender binary. Few identify with Jenner, least of all the youth who know him only as the humiliated reality television grandfather. Those in our 30s, 40s, and 50s barely recall the Wheaties box. Trans* men and genderqueer people, populations of color, and those of less means felt ignored in the ABC story and offended by Jenner's wealth and white privilege. Jenner's story does resonate for some, but not the majority. We doubt that Jenner's story will assist us with our current struggles: housing and employment discrimination, poor access to healthcare, bullying and suicide, a legal system often hostile to even our basic needs, as well as the multiple oppressions, microaggressions, and traumas we face every day.What's more, the connection to the Kardashian circus and the upcoming reality show make us more than a little uncomfortable. We fear additional spectacle and fetishization that we categorically do not need. We wonder if transgender people are simply the latest media sensation. There have been no celebrations, feelings of joy, or sighs of relief. We're all just glad it's over.Outsiders do not see it, but we have a very strong community with conferences that draw thousands of people as well as online and offline forums where tens of thousands more can dialogue. We are police officers, construction workers, teachers, authors, therapists, doctors, taxi drivers, professionals, parents, spouses, even soldiers... people who walk with pride.Our pioneers are not the Bruce Jenner and Chaz Bono celebrities, but many whose names the public will find less familiar: Janet Mock, Laverne Cox, and Jenny Boylan, Aidan Key, Leslie Feinberg, Jamison Green, Sylvia Rivera, Tiq Milan, Gabriel Foster, Dru Levasseur, Justus Eisfeld, S. Bear Bergman, Susan Stryker, Paisley Currah, Kate Bornstein, and more... as well as the innumerable unsung others whose daily work it is to confront the issues we face, the thought leaders writing books, blogs, and articles, those lecturing at conferences, medical schools, and international organizations, and the still more working with governments. They are the ones we look to for guidance.We are not lost and hoping for rescue.We are not victims in need of a savior.We are empowered individuals entitled to our rights and demanding our place within the public sphere.We're happy to have Jenner as one of us, but please don't anoint him without our permission."

She is so very real, and just when you think you have overcome her, she will multiply.I guess I should start at the beginning, though, since you have yet to deal with your first mean girl.So, what is a mean girl?A mean girl is a bully who will use mental warfare and aggression to drag you down every chance she can get.She may even start out as a friend in disguise, but make no mistake -- she will show her true colors before long.And when she does, look out!She will manipulate any situation, as well as others who she can, to gain the upper hand to ensure that she will be the victor of all the spoils.I wish I could tell you that you will never have to deal with the dreaded mean girl, but sadly. I know better at my age.But why are mean girls so mean?By now, you might be wondering as you read this letter what makes a mean girl tick.Well, quite simply one word and only one word comes to mind: JEALOUSY!A mean girl truly has very little self-confidence and is always looking to steal your thunder, because at the heart of the matter is good old-fashioned jealousy.So, as mom's once favorite show, ""Friends"" tells it, ""You need to be to your own wind keeper and not let anyone steal your wind!""Still, don't get me wrong; the mean girl tactics may have evolved since I was your age with the added bonus use of technology, such as nasty, vile text messages and more.But the reasoning and logic behind a mean girl's motives haven't changed at all.So the more things may have changed since I was your age, the more they stay the same in essence.So, then, how do you beat a mean girl at her own game?1. Ignore, ignore, ignoreIf you give a mean girl and her antics play, you are only adding fuel to her already growing fire. You need to try your best to hold your head high and ignore her to indeed squash her mean girl ways like the annoying gnat that she truly is.2. Be confidentNo matter what, make sure to not let her get under your skin. This is definitely easier than it sounds, but still so crucial. Make sure to look her right in the eye, even smile to let her know that you are a bigger, better person than she is at all times and that you aren't a fool in knowing full well what she is all about.3. Use your brains to outsmart herYou are bright and capable young girls, who not only have a vast vocabulary at your means and ready, but need not forget this when verbalizing your feelings with the mean girl. So, use your brains and outsmart her whenever possible. Trust your dear old mom when I say that the mean girl most likely won't be the brightest lightbulb in the package and this is truly where you can shine if you only believe in yourself. 4. Find her achilles heelEveryone has one and the sooner you do find the mean girl's weakness or proverbial kryptonite, I give you my permission to use it to your advantage. Whatever it is, I promise you she won't have a comeback for it and won't know what hit her!5. Remember this too shall passLike I said earlier, your latest mean girl will not be your current mean girl 20 years later or even five years from now, but again understand that even after this mean girl is long behind you, another one will sprout up as sure as the sun rises each and every morning. The trick here is learning from this experience and being one step ahead of the next mean girl on the horizon.When all else fails, I am here. have been through the trenches and back myself to impart my years of experience upon you. And I have your back no matter what and will always, because quite simply you had my heart from the get go and are my girls.Love always,Your Mom (Who has Battled Her Fair Share of Mean Girls in the Past)"

22,WOMEN,Lily Tomlin And Jane Fonda Break Down Myths About Feminism Like The Bosses They Are,Sasha Bronner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jane-fonda-lily-tomlin-feminism_n_7195374.html,,2015-05-05,"LOS ANGELES, CA - APRIL 29: Actors Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda attend the premiere of Netflix's 'Grace and Frankie' at Regal Cinemas L.A. Live on April 29, 2015 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb60381260000300182e01e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“One of the tenets of feminism is that we shouldn’t give up who we are, or feel that in order to be OK in life, we have to be attached to a certain kind of man. I can say that because that was how I lived for a long time,” Jane Fonda told The Huffington Post on Thursday in Los Angeles. “Oh my god, if I’m not married to some alpha male, then I’m not valid.”Fonda’s longtime friend and co-star on Netflix’s upcoming “Grace and Frankie,” Lily Tomlin, jumped in. “You can be committed in a marriage or to a person, but you have to have enough of your own freedom that you can step away and save yourself,” she said.At its simplest, feminism is the belief in the social, political and economic equality of the sexes. It's also a politically-charged word, one that during the early 2000s, took on a negative connotation in certain contexts. It was seen in some circles as an insult, and many women shied away from identifying with it publicly, for fear of seeming too ""aggressive.""Today, as the conversation around gender equality, reproductive rights and equal pay has been reignited in earnest, these fears are melting away. Fast. (See Beyonce, Sheryl Sandberg, John Legend and Amy Schumer, who have all embraced the term over the past few years.) Fonda and Tomlin, who have long identified as feminists, seemed eager to set the record straight about the real meaning of the word.“Feminism doesn’t mean that you’re against men or that you’re some angry bra-burner. In fact, I don’t think they really did burn bras,” Fonda said. (Pro tip: that whole ""burning bras"" thing is indeed a myth.) “Feminism is nothing less than saying I want to be a whole human being with equal rights and equal opportunities,” she continued.“And you want it to be about men as well,” Tomlin added. “It should be about the whole species.”Sitting side by side in chairs at the London Hotel in West Hollywood, Fonda turned to Tomlin: ”Most of our male friends are feminists, right?” she asked, and then paused, adding, “Well, not my ex-husbands."" Tomlin threw her head back with laughter. Fonda and Tomlin, who are 77 and 75 respectively, say they feel lucky to star in a show with roles written specifically for them -- especially since leading roles for older women are sadly few and far between.In ""Grace And Frankie,"" Fonda and Tomlin play two women whose longtime husbands announce they want divorces in order to get remarried -- to each other. The two women’s lives are turned upside down, and despite their many differences, they end up supporting each other in unexpected ways. Fonda said her character, Grace, is a woman who is defined by externals, like being married to the right man and playing golf, a sport Frankie (played by Tomlin) knows Grace hates.“Frankie is the person who begins to teach me to be who I really am. To stop lying about who I am in order to try to keep a guy,” Fonda said. “That’s an important issue for women. I’m not the only one who has tied myself in pretzels to try and keep a man.”They also touched on the importance of female friendship, a theme that comes up often in ""Grace and Frankie.""“A lot of women have no idea how important their friendships are,” Tomlin said.“The fact is, women much more than men can have extremely intense and profound relationships. The older you get, the more you realize it,” Fonda added.Tomlin said she remembers a time when it was common for women to not earn their own wages: “My own mother didn’t work until I was about 12 years old and she went to work as a nurse’s aid in the hospital. Before that, my dad would dole out about $40 a week from his paycheck.”Pointing out that there are still women who don’t earn their own money, Tomlin said, “I think you have to pay wives who stay home and are homemakers. It’s a big heavy job to do that.”Fonda agreed. “People should be paid for doing work like that. And all of us should encourage our daughters to be capable of earning their own money. Because you never know what can happen. All females should grow up with job skills.”Watching Fonda and Tomlin interact, it's clear that their connection runs deep. They're a natural comedy duo, too. They are longtime friends who support one another’s social causes and finish each other's sentences. And when it comes to feminism and female empowerment, their beliefs also line up. The prospect of Hillary Clinton becoming the United States' first female president brought smiles to both of their faces.“We both think that it’s perfectly possible and maybe even probable. Although it’s not good to make it look like it’s inevitable,” Fonda said of Clinton. “I think we are all going to have to work hard and make sure we show up and vote. But it would sure be good. Maybe that would lead to equal pay -- wouldn’t that be nice? It’s about time.”“Grace and Frankie"" airs May 8 on Netflix."

In her view, old ways of talking about formal systems of power and corruption don't begin to capture new realities. Truth and transparency, she warns, have devolved into a performance art. The buck stops nowhere. Could women be particularly suited to disrupt the unaccountability structured into the DNA of many of today's financial, corporate and governmental organizations? Wedel weighs in. (Accountability is a key topic in a May 5-6 conference sponsored by the Institute for New Economic Thinking, "" Finance and Society,"" which features Brooksley Born, Elizabeth Warren, and other influential women who have challenged corrupt systems of power).Lynn Parramore: You've discussed a fascinating new kind of power broker on the world stage — a nimble, opportunistic person who floats between private and public institutions. How has this figure operated in the financial arena? Are such players different from lobbyists and other traditional influence peddlers? Can you give some examples?Janine Wedel: In the financial arena, a well-known duo is Robert Rubin and Larry Summers, both former treasury secretaries. Rubin reached the heights at Goldman Sachs. He then went to Treasury in the 1990s, then on to Citigroup. In the lead up to the financial crash, both Goldman and Citigroup earned billions on the unregulated derivatives that he and Summers (and others) championed while in public office.Summers has been even more influential: Treasury in the 90s, then back to Harvard where, as president, he invested some of the endowment in derivatives — a disastrous move. He then went to Wall Street hedge fund work, and then back to Washington with a top perch advising the Obama White House.Both Rubin and Summers have moved among advisory and corporate boards, think tanks and the like. Summers, especially, maintains an active media presence. Their worldview and life experiences are enmeshed with Wall Street. Neither are lobbyists. It's not that they are beholden to Wall Street in the manner of a traditional lobbyist, but that Wall Street and Washington have substantially merged. Goldman had an express policy of placing its alumni in Washington jobs – earning it the nickname of ""Government Sachs.""This is not the old revolving door, which has only one exit point. Today's revolving door has 4 or 5 or more: a player exits to an academic role, a media role, a government role, a business role, a think tank role, and straddles two or more at the same time. Traditional financial lobbyists are still out there fighting for their Wall Street clients, but they have to register. The most elite players generally do not, and their hugely important influence activities are much harder to measure and trace.LP: Back in 1998, when Bill Clinton was president, Commodity Futures Trading Commission head Brooksley Born took on a powerful clique led by Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan, Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, his deputy Larry Summers, and SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt. They wanted to loosen the rules on derivatives; she didn't. Their victory helped set the stage for the financial catastrophe in 2007-8, yet these men have gone on to play even more influential roles, often in financial firms that benefitted from unregulated derivatives. What does this say about who ends up with formal power today?JW: I call what these players have done ""failing up."" They have made spectacular errors of judgment and are called upon to give advice on public policy. Part of the problem is that the lines between top Washington economic players and the industry they are supposed to regulate are effectively non-existent. The know-how and inside information gleaned in ""public service"" are now worth huge amounts of money to financial firms looking for clout in dealing with Washington regulators.It doesn't mean that these players were necessarily judging derivatives and looking ahead to a payday. It's more subtle. They believed that what was good for Wall Street was good for everyone. For them, private sector folks were the innovators, the wealth creators, the early adopters. The regulators, in their eyes, mostly just got in the way of all that good stuff. Now we know that the good stuff was just for Wall Street.LP: In an article praising ""difficult women"" in finance, you point out that women can sometimes help disrupt corrupt systems that allow mostly male insiders to make the rules and profit from them. Why are women particularly well suited for disruption?JW: Outsiders are well suited for disruption, and it just so happens that in the most powerful venues, women continue to remain outsiders. They may ruffle feathers not because they have a superior moral compass but because, at least for now, they are dogged outsiders who've fought their whole lives to be with the big boys. Senator Elizabeth Warren, former FDIC chairperson Sheila Bair, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission head Brooksley Born have all acted as whistleblowers or disrupters in some part of the financial system. Their stories reveal something unusually relentless. Each has had a moment of being denied entry into elite quarters. A person like this is less likely to succumb to the groupthink that can normalize sketchy behavior.Whistleblower Carmen Segarra is another case in point. In 2009, when the New York Fed was staring down reforms like Dodd Frank that would give it more supervisory power, NY Fed chief (and former Goldman partner) Bill Dudley commissioned what was supposed to be a confidential report by Columbia University finance professor David Beim on what went wrong at the bank that might have contributed to the crash.Beim concluded that the culture of the NY Fed was too enmeshed in Wall Street to be a truly effective supervisor. He urged the bank to bring in disruptive outsider personalities who wouldn't be subject to regulatory capture, so they hired Segarra, who quickly became frustrated at what she saw as a too-accommodating approach by the Fed with Goldman Sachs. She was fired after refusing to tone down her report, so it's not a total win for accountability, not least for Segarra herself — but her secret recordings of what transpired as she and her colleagues discussed regulations at this hugely powerful institution have been illuminating—and resulted in Congressional hearings.Her outsider status meant she wasn't going to overly identify with the needs and wants of her peers. As she mentioned in the public radio program ""This American Life"" she was struck by the devastation the 2008 crash had on regular folks. This shows a strong affiliation with the world far outside Wall Street. That's an important element in disruption.LP: You note that our legal and regulatory systems were set up to catch what you call ""old-style corruption,"" like bribery and outright fraud, but they don't work for new, far more sophisticated and indirect styles of corruption. How can we bring more accountability?JW: Fundamentally, ethics has become disconnected from accountability. Accountability has devolved into checklists and performances to appear accountable and satisfy the outside auditors. Anthropologists call this ""audit culture."" We perform for the auditor or the congressional committee or the risk compliance officer. But these checklists and performances have little to do with true accountability. We need to reunite ethics with the practice of accountability.Also, we need to be hyper-alert to former government officials and legislators who might appear in the media or other public fora without disclosing their current roles. Why is former Congressman X on a Sunday morning chat show? He might be pushing a certain policy at the behest of a client, and yet is invariably identified by his public service role, even if it's a decade old.Self-policing is not the answer. For example, academic economists who are also affiliated with financial firms should not be the ones to judge whether they need to disclose their corporate affiliations when they are speaking or writing about economic policy. The zeitgeist today is all about blurring boundaries, but that makes accountability difficult.As citizens, we have to stay vigilant in terms of regulation even if it's a slog. Look at Dodd Frank — the president signed the law, but Wall Street then hired massive legal assistance to haggle over every comma and generally thwart implementation.Reforms need to be thoughtfully considered and their actual results anticipated. The Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, aimed at strengthening disclosure requirements among lobbyists, caused a sharp decline in the number of registered lobbyists. But did they stop lobbying? No, many, if not most, simply don't register—creating a black hole of accountability. They were counting on weak enforcement because for decades we have devalued the role of regulatory enforcement.LP: Looking at Europe, you describe how big Western banks like Goldman Sachs colluded with local leaders in ways that have been devastating to the economies of countries like Greece. Yet the president the European Central Bank is a former Goldman Sachs managing director. How does this kind of situation impact public trust?JW: It devastates trust. The situation in Greece is a dire one, and the Greeks are obviously railing against EU-imposed austerity measures by voting the left wing party into power. Of course, the way Greece was operating was unsustainable. But let's just pretend for a moment that Mario Draghi did indeed have the right answer for Greece. How can you trust that he has the people's interest at heart when he is so closely associated with Wall Street people and mindsets?LP: You've studied Eastern Europe and note that the kind of helplessness, fatalism, and gallows humor common under communism is now starting to crop up here in the West, where public trust is under siege and ordinary people feel increasingly cynical about elected leaders and the democratic process. To many, the financial system is a game rigged against them, one in which they are permanent outsiders and losers. How can the outsiders regain influence?JW: We have to support quality investigative journalism, which is dying by the day. Question what you are hearing from a powerful person and ask yourself why they are saying it. Insist on accountability legislation and support budgets for enforcement. And the next time you see a ""hot"" corruption case that involves a fancy watch or a stash of cash in a freezer, just ignore it and look for the bigger fish — the ones who'll never see a day in prison!

24,IMPACT,"Here's Who's Helping Hundreds Of Pregnant, Rescued Boko Haram Kidnapping Victims",Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/boko-haram-pregnant-victims_n_7215792.html,,2015-05-05,"Lami Musa, 27-year-old who says her husband was killed before she was abducted by Islamist extremists, cradles her 5-day-old baby girl at a refugee camp clinic after she and others were rescued by Nigerian soldiers from Sambisa Forest, Yola, Nigeria Monday, May 4, 2015. Even with the crackle of gunfire signaling rescuers were near, the horrors did not end: Boko Haram fighters stoned captives to death, some girls and women were crushed by an armored car and three died when a land mine exploded as they walked to freedom. Through tears, smiles and eyes filled with pain, the survivors of months in the hands of the Islamic extremists told their tragic stories to The Associated Press on Sunday, their first day out of the war zone. ""We just have to give praise to God that we are alive, those of us who have survived,"" said 27-year-old Lami Musa. (AP Photo/Sunday Alamba)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1d918240000500055661e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Among the Boko Haram kidnapping victims recently rescued were at least 214 pregnant women and girls, according to the UNFPA.Thanks to a new infusion of armory, the Nigerian military saved 234 women and girls from the terrorist group’s stronghold in the Sambisa Forest last Thursday. As the survivors begin to settle into the IDP camps in the Borno State, the UNFPA is stepping in to offer prenatal services and psychological care to pregnant women and those who recently gave birth. But the organization’s current tally just includes those who are visibly pregnant, according to a statement released by the UNFPA. The group is continuing its screening process. The aid organization is armed with clean delivery kits and is equipped to handle deliveries. Last year alone, more than 16,000 women delivered at UNFPA facilities in northeast Nigeria, but not all of those cases have been confirmed as pregnancies related to the Boko Haram kidnappings. To effectively treat severely malnourished babies, health workers gave infants intravenous drips and packs of therapeutic food to suck from, according to the AP. Experts say that psychological support is key to helping victims who were subjected to a whole host of atrocities, including being repeatedly raped, sold into sexual slavery or indoctrinated, according to the AP. Last week alone, the UNFPA offered psychological counseling to 15 pregnant women, but the group couldn't confirm that they were all rescued from Boko Haram.Binta Abdullahi, who was kidnapped more than a year ago, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that she was spared from getting married off to a Boko Haram member because she was pregnant when she arrived. The group warned her that she would be forced to wed after she gave birth or she would be sold as a slave if she refused. ""They said since we would not marry them they would sell us as slaves at the right time,” she told the news outlet. ""Fortunately I was rescued a day after giving birth. I thank God.” This latest effort brought the total number of rescued females to 677. Many said they were taken captive in the past nine months when Boko Haram overtook a large portion of northeastern Nigeria and deemed it an Islamic caliphate, according to the AP.But officials say that the schoolgirls from the infamous kidnapping in Chibok were not among those who have been recently rescued. “One year of captivity is a long time for anyone to bear,” Dr. Babatunde Osotimehin, executive director of UNFPA, said in a statement on the anniversary of the kidnapping. “It has been a year full of unimaginable suffering and anguish, not just for the girls, their families and their communities, but also for the world at large. It is time for the girls and all other abductees to resume their lives in peace. It is time for this nightmare to come to an end.”  Like Us On Facebook   Follow Us On Twitter  "
