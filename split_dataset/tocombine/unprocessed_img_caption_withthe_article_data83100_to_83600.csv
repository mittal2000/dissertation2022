But then the camera pans down to reveal...,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55aeb379120000580013aebc.png?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Piers Morgan slammed Nicki Minaj's tweets about the 2015 MTV VMA nominations, calling her a ""stroppy little piece of work"" and saying she should not use the ""race or skinny cards"" because Taylor Swift's video was just better. Minaj tweeted at MTV Tuesday after the 2015 VMA nominees were announced. The ""Pinkprint"" rapper asked why the hugely talked-about ""Anaconda"" video didn't get nominated in the categories of Video of the Year or Best Choreography. She also wondered how ""Feelin' Myself"" with Beyoncé also failed to get a nom. Swift's ""Bad Blood,"" which features a bevy of white Victoria's Secret models, is in the running for Video of the Year. She is the only female nominated other than Bey.Minaj broached the issue of race in MTV's nominations in a series of tweets to her 20 million followers.Although Minaj never named Swift, the pop star directly responded to Minaj and suggested that maybe one of the male artists nominated -- Ed Sheeran, Kendrick Lamar or Mark Ronson featuring Bruno Mars -- took her spot. On Wednesday, Morgan wrote a piece for the Daily Mail targeting Minaj. He opened with an anecdote about the rapper not taking a photo with his sons during a guest appearance on ""America's Got Talent"" while Morgan was a judge. He then said he had sympathy for Swift because he himself has faced backlash from what he called ""Black Twitter"" -- ""a very large, vocal and aggressive social media group of mainly black Americans who collectively leap on any perceived racial insult or bias to expel their indignation."" I have no sympathy with Nicki Minaj, who emerges as a whiny brat that just doesn’t like losing. Her charges of racism and big-bodyism are frankly laughable when you consider that three of the five nominations for Video of the Year are black artists. And one of them is Beyoncé, whose own body is far more aligned to the Minaj school of physical beauty than Taylor Swift’s. Further, 43 of the entire list of 75 nominations for this year’s VMAs include black artists. Oh, and Minaj herself gets three nominations in other categories. So the central allegations are a load of old hogwash. The reason your video didn’t get nominated for Video of the Year, Ms Minaj, is that it wasn’t as good as the others which did.He concluded: ""For Nicki Minaj, who is indisputably very talented, to play the race card just because her video didn’t get the nomination she wanted is a cheap piece of faux outrage deliberately designed to stir up unnecessary racial tension where it shouldn’t exist. Shame on you, Ms Minaj.""See what else Nicki had to say on Twitter:Many other outlets, including The Huffington Post's Zeba Blay, have highlighted how Minaj's tweets spoke to a much larger issue within the music industry and feminism at large. Swift tried to deflect Minaj's criticisms of the music industry (again, not about Swift personally) by pointing out that ""one of the men"" might have taken Minaj's nomination spot. This was irrelevant to Minaj's argument, and a classic example of the way White Feminism works to undermine women of color -- trying to make things solely about gender in order to not have to talk about race, while perpetuating the idea that white women and women of color experience the same kinds of sexism and oppression. It's vital to note this doesn't mean Swift is a terrible, horrible racist. She was clearly well-meaning, even when she (a tad condescendingly) added later that Nicki was invited to come up with her on stage if she won. All her words were well-meaning, but they spoke to her cluelessness and privilege. Also on HuffPost:To subscribe to our HuffPost Entertainment WhatsApp account:1. Download WhatsApp on your phone.2.

Ted Cruz argued for term limits on the Supreme Court justices.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b0048c1800003d003769dc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) claims the recent Supreme Court decisions on same-sex marriage and Obamacare are the ""very definition of tyranny.""The 2016 presidential candidate, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Oversight, Agency Action, Federal Rights and Federal Courts, convened a hearing Wednesday to investigate what he called ""abuses"" by the highest court in the land.""If any of us believes in democracy, in the constitutional rule of law, then whether we agree or disagree with a policy ... we should be horrified at the notion that five unelected judges can seize authority from the American people,"" he said. ""We did not establish philosopher kings in this country,"" Cruz added, before calling for term limits on Supreme Court justices.The Texas firebrand further laid into Justice Anthony Kennedy, the swing vote who wrote the majority opinion in the gay marriage case and who also voted to spare the Affordable Care Act from a major challenge. The senator said that Kennedy's ""pop psychology has no basis in the text and history of the Constitution.""Kennedy's June opinion making marriage equality the law of the land was criticized by conservatives and even some liberals -- the latter of whom took issue with his ""muddled"" and ""unconvincing"" logic, even as they praised the outcome.Sen. Chris Coons (D-Del.), the subcommittee's ranking member, said he was ""surprised"" that Republicans were upset with what has been, on the whole, a conservative-leaning court. He noted that liberals disagreed with other Supreme Court decisions, citing rulings on campaign finance and voting rights.After opening statements from several legal experts, Cruz asked one witness, Chapman University law professor John C. Easterman, to elaborate on a proposal that would allow the states to rein in federal judicial power. Easterman, who serves as board chairman of the National Organization for Marriage, an anti-gay marriage group, said that states should have the ability to overrule the Supreme Court.“I think the Constitution structure ought to give them a check, and the one that I propose is a simple majority of the states -- that would not be easy to accomplish on any issue because it would mean that only truly egregious threats to state sovereignty as a measure would rise to that level -- but a simple majority of the states ought to be able to override those kinds of decisions by the Supreme Court,"" he said.What would constitute a ""truly egregious"" threat? Easterman did not say."
2,POLITICS,Discover Penalized For Allegedly Cheating Student Loan Borrowers,Shahien Nasiripour,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/discover-financial-services-penalized-for-cheating-student-loan-borrowers_us_55afa824e4b08f57d5d31398,The bank reportedly overcharged borrowers and hounded them with early-morning phone calls.,2015-07-22,<p>Discover has agreed to pay at least $18.5 million for its allegedly illegal student loan servicing practices. </p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_29_0_3583_2024%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Discover Financial Services agreed to pay at least $18.5 million for allegedly cheating more than 100,000 borrowers with private student loans, the federal Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Wednesday.The regulator alleged that the company, one of the nation's largest banks with more than $84 billion in assets, broke the law when it overcharged borrowers, likely denied them important tax benefits, hounded them with early-morning and late-night collection calls to their cell phones, and engaged in illegal debt-collection tactics.Discover ""failed at providing the most basic functions of adequate student loan servicing,"" the CFPB said. Discover, which is mostly known for its credit cards, neither admitted to nor denied the allegations. Jon Drummond, a bank spokesman, declined to comment.With more than 41 million Americans collectively owing nearly $1.4 trillion on their student loans, making it the second-largest source of household debt after home mortgages, the federal government has taken a keen interest in improving how student loan specialists interact with borrowers. About one in five borrowers is in default on their student loans, a figure policymakers fear will rise if companies such as Discover don't improve their loan servicing activities.The federal government either insures or owns nearly 90 percent of all outstanding student debt, Education Department and Federal Reserve data show. The CFPB said borrowers with private student loans generally already have federal student loans and carry high levels of debt.Since private student loans don't offer the same generous repayment plans and strict consumer protections as federal loans, consumer advocates and federal regulators reckon that private loan borrowers are among the nation's most vulnerable debtors. The student loan industry disagrees with that assessment.The Discover settlement is the consumer regulator's first public enforcement action against a company accused of mistreating student loan borrowers. It comes as the CFPB considers new rules to govern student loan servicing, or the business of processing borrowers' monthly payments and counseling them on their repayment options.The consumer regulator accused Discover of deceiving some 7,000 borrowers by overstating the minimum monthly amounts they owed nearly 30,000 times, causing some to fall behind and pay unnecessary late fees and penalties. Discover also allegedly misled more than 156,000 borrowers by falsely telling them they hadn't paid any interest on their loans, likely causing them to pay more in federal taxes because they didn't think they qualified for important tax deductions.In addition, the CFPB accused Discover of placing more than 150,000 calls demanding payment to borrowers' cell phones at inconvenient times, such as before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m, with many of the calls occurring before 7 a.m. More than 1,000 borrowers received dozens of such calls. Discover found out about these practices in October 2012, but didn't address it until February 2013.The student loan industry for years has been trying to convince the Federal Communications Commission to ease restrictions on calling borrowers' cell phones, federal records show. The Education Department, backed by the White House, has repeatedly asked Congress to change the law and make it easier for student loan contractors to call borrowers' cell phones, according to federal budget documents.Discover also failed to provide 252 borrowers in default on their debts with basic information, such as details about the amount owed, the source of the debt, and the borrower's right to contest its validity. The CFPB accused Discover of violating the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.""Discover created student debt stress for borrowers by inflating their bills and misleading them about important benefits,” said Richard Cordray, the consumer bureau's director. “Illegal servicing and debt collection practices add insult to injury for borrowers struggling to pay back their loans.""Many of Discover's allegedly illegal practices concerned loans it acquired beginning in 2010 from Citigroup, the nation's third-largest bank with more than $1.8 trillion in assets. Discover ""maintained many of Citibank's procedures and policies for servicing the acquired loans,"" the CFPB alleged, referencing Citi's banking unit. The allegation raises questions over whether Citi also will face future enforcement actions.Mark Rodgers, a Citi spokesman, and Moira Vahey, a CFPB spokeswoman, declined to comment.Concerns are mounting among federal policymakers that inadequate student loan servicing is causing unnecessary defaults. President Barack Obama in March ordered federal agencies to recommend new measures to improve how companies service student loans and treat borrowers.""If a servicer like Discover can't even correctly disclose basic information, it raises serious concerns about the industry overall being able to perform the complex hands-on work of helping distressed borrowers,"" said Maura Dundon, a former regulator at the Federal Trade Commission who now serves as senior policy counsel at the Center for Responsible Lending.The CFPB ordered Discover to pay a $2.5 million fine. The company also agreed to pay borrowers at least $16 million in restitution.About 5,200 borrowers will have their student loan accounts credited up to $500. Roughly 130,000 borrowers will either receive up to $300 reimbursement for tax preparation costs, or have free tax services provided, as a result of filing amended tax returns due to Discover's faulty practices. Some 5,000 borrowers will have their accounts credited up to $142 for inconvenient collection calls.The company is one of the nation's largest lenders of private student loans, with nearly $9 billion in non-government backed student debt balances on its books, according to its latest quarterly report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company values a portion of that debt, which it acquired from other lenders, at about 92 cents on the dollar.Discover warned its investors in April that it expected the CFPB's enforcement action, and first disclosed the investigation in February 2014. The CFPB said last October its examiners had found many of the unfair practices the agency on Wednesday accused Discover of engaging in. CFPB enforcement actions against banks, like in Discover's case, typically include parallel proceedings by the lender's banking regulators, such as the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Federal Reserve or Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. It's unclear why other regulators didn't join the CFPB's settlement with Discover.The regulator's settlement with Discover didn't require the company to admit wrongdoing. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who conceived of and helped create the consumer bureau, has criticized other federal financial regulators for not requiring companies to admit misconduct when settling accusations they cheated households. In response, the CFPB said its settlement will result in improvements in Discover's practices."
3,POLITICS,Colorado Death Penalty In Focus As Massacre Trial Enters New Phase,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colorado-death-penalty_us_55af9aeee4b0a9b948530a4d,"DENVER, July 22 (Reuters) - The lead prosecutor in the Colorado movie massacre trial tore into the state's governor at a",2015-07-22,"""Young L.A. Girl Slain; Body Slashed in Two"" ― L.A.'s Daily News",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/559e0f0a1b00002e0027f4f3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"DENVER, July 22 (Reuters) - The lead prosecutor in the Colorado movie massacre trial tore into the state's governor at a news conference, calling him arrogant and weak for giving the mass murderer a reprieve from execution.This was two years ago, and Arapahoe County District Attorney George Brauchler was not talking about James Holmes, who last week was found guilty on all counts by a jury for fatally shooting 12 people and wounding 70 at a midnight premiere of a Batman film in July 2012.At the time, Brauchler was responding to Governor John Hickenlooper's decision to grant a temporary reprieve in an earlier Denver-area mass killing. That case sheds light on the political sensitivities surrounding the ultimate punishment in Colorado.On Wednesday, the jury which convicted Holmes on 165 counts of first-degree murder, attempted murder, and explosives charges begin the penalty phase of the trial. After hearing more weeks of testimony, they will decide if the California native is to be executed by lethal injection, or serve life in prison with no possibility of parole.Colorado has executed just one inmate in nearly 50 years. Still, a Denver Post poll last year showed 63 percent of state residents surveyed support the death penalty. In the case of Holmes, a separate poll by the newspaper this week showed an overwhelming 70 percent favored execution for the former neuroscience graduate student. That poll had received more than 5,800 votes by Tuesday afternoon.Two years ago, Brauchler called his news conference at the state Capitol to denounce Hickenlooper's granting of a so-called ""temporary reprieve"" to the state's longest-serving death row inmate. Nathan Dunlap was convicted in 1996 of killing four workers at a pizza restaurant where he had recently been fired.The temporary reprieve meant the governor's successor could reinstate Dunlap's death sentence, and the prosecutor decried the decision as indecisive, and ""clemency light.""""You hear frustration and anger in my voice because those victims that have waited patiently for justice for 20 years will now wait for years more,"" Brauchler told reporters at the time.CORRECTIONS OFFICER KILLEDIn addition to Dunlap there are two other convicted murderers on Colorado's death row. All three African-American men were prosecuted by the same Arapahoe County District Attorney's office, and all attended the same suburban Denver high school.But that is only part of the state's story with the death penalty. At least four Colorado death sentences were overturned after the U.S Supreme Court ruled only juries could condemn an inmate to death. The ruling said laws in Colorado and other states were unconstitutional because they let judges impose the death sentence.Another inmate's death sentence was commuted to life after it was learned jurors consulted a Bible during deliberations.In another high-profile recent case, prosecutors sought the death penalty for Edward Montour, an inmate who was already serving a life sentence for killing his 11-week-old daughter. Montour beat corrections officer Eric Autobee to death with a ladle in a prison kitchen in 2002.Acting as his own lawyer, Montour pleaded guilty to first-degree murder and was sentenced to death by a judge. The sentence was one of those overturned by the Supreme Court ruling against judge-imposed death sentences.The case landed back in the district attorney's office, and Brauchler vowed to try Montour again and seek the death penalty.But the saga took an unexpected twist when the victim's father, Robert Autobee, a former corrections officer, went public with his opposition to the execution of his son's killer.Autobee, 60, launched a campaign against the death penalty and was soon embroiled in a war of words with Brauchler, who filed a motion seeking to have Autobee barred from testifying at Montour's trial.And the case then took a further turn last year when Montour's new lawyers uncovered evidence that he may have been unjustly convicted in his daughter's death. The infant may have suffered from a medical condition, the lawyers said, and her father may not have inflicted her injuries.Brauchler relented, and allowed Montour to plead guilty to killing the prison guard in exchange for a life sentence.Autobee has since attended parts of the movie massacre trial, and one day sat with Holmes' parents, Arlene and Bob. Autobee said the gunman's mother contacted him after she read about his campaign to end the death penalty.""I could feel their pain, and decided that if I'm going to be against the death penalty, I need to be visible,"" Autobee told Reuters by telephone.
