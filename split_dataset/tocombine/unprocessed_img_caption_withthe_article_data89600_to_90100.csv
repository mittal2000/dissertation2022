0,COLLEGE,"Colleges Suspend Students For Sexual Assault, But Don't Actually Ban Them From Campus",Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sexual-assault-suspensions_n_7228198.html,,2015-05-09,Walking around Michigan State University on the day of the FPS competition.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae585f24000030009663a8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Loophole No. 1: The University of California, San Francisco, punished a student found responsible for sexual assault with a yearlong suspension that started one month after he had finished all his classes for his degree. Loophole No. 2: He's still allowed on campus -- a fact that the victim says UCSF failed to tell her.Colleges are under greater pressure now to respond to sexual assault allegations, thanks to a wave of student activism and action by the White House and members of Congress, as well as investigations by the U.S. Department of Education. But strong punishments for guilty students at some universities aren't always as forceful as they seem.And federal officials have little to say about that. The Education Department's Office for Civil Rights is currently investigating 110 colleges and universities for how they handle sexual assault cases. The agency has released guidance indicating certain school policies it considers necessary to adhere to the gender equity law Title IX, but it has not stipulated what kind of punishment schools should dole out for various offenses.""What I do is to enforce Title IX, [and the law] doesn't specify what is or is not an appropriate punishment,"" Catherine Lhamon, assistant secretary for civil rights at the Education Department, told The Huffington Post.Her office's guidance directs colleges to take ""prompt and effective"" steps to address sexual assault and harassment among students. But she noted ""there's a lot behind what is prompt and effective"" in particular cases, and she said her office is ""not well-positioned"" to set specific punishments.""I think we've said all that needs to be said,"" Lhamon added.Without government-mandated sanctions, schools have varied widely in what they've judged to be appropriate punishment. Some have slapped sexual assault offenders with ""expulsion after graduation"" or book reports.In the UCSF case, a student who asked to use the pseudonym Vera told HuffPost that the school's investigation of her sexual assault case dragged on for six months. By the time the offender pleaded no contest in mid-April, he had completed all his classes. He will serve a one-year suspension and then he can receive his Doctor of Pharmacy degree, the university said in an email obtained by HuffPost.On April 30, five days after the offending student was suspended and more than one month after he'd finished his courses, Vera said she spotted him on campus. When she complained to the university, a UCSF lawyer responded that nothing in his punishment actually bans him from campus.""Under the Student Code of Conduct, suspension does not necessarily result in a complete ban on campus. ... In this case, the University has had 'no contact' orders in place that prevent the respondent from initiating contact,"" the UCSF lawyer wrote to Vera's attorney, Laura Dunn. ""While his student status is terminated for a specified period of time, he will not be restricted from accessing certain School resources.""The UCSF lawyer went on to explain that the offending student must let the school know when he comes on campus and that there is still a no-contact order requiring him to stay away from Vera. UCSF spokeswoman Jennifer O'Brien declined to comment on Vera's situation, but said in a statement that in cases ""where an individual is considered to be a physical threat, the university takes measures to either prohibit or restrict their access to the campus."" Dunn, founder of the advocacy group SurvJustice, observed a similar situation in a case she worked on at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas.A male UNLV student who had been set to graduate in the summer of 2014 was found responsible for sexual assault and given a four-year suspension that September, according to a federal complaint Dunn filed on behalf of the reported victim. Since the investigation had put a hold on his graduation, that meant he should not receive his diploma until May 2018.Four days after that suspension was supposed to start, the victim, who requested anonymity, learned that the offending student was permitted on campus for a fraternity event. UNLV had failed to tell the woman in the case that since the accused had appealed his punishment, he was not yet barred from campus. She then learned in October 2014 that her offender had received his UNLV diploma, according to her complaint. The school said that someone must have ""messed up,"" according to the complaint, but that even with his diploma in hand, he technically hadn't graduated.Dunn argues that punishment after graduation or other loopholes in seemingly strong sanctions are ""yet another way for colleges and universities to avoid their obligations to address sexual violence."" And she thinks they hope the victims simply won't notice.""With the heightened scrutiny, campuses want to look tougher on this issue without actually having to be tough,"" Dunn said. ""They still feel that sexual violence is not an issue they should truly show zero tolerance on or that it is someone else's problem to deal with it.""UNLV declined to comment on the case.In a case at Michigan State University, a junior who asked to be identified only by her first name, Ashley, said a male student had sexually assaulted her. The accused was found responsible for sexual assault in January 2014 and expelled, according to confidential documents provided to HuffPost. But the offending student sued Michigan State to challenge its procedures and then later dropped the suit. Ashley points out that the lawsuit-related delay gave him time to finish out the semester, and then he transferred to the University of Michigan. Moreover, on May 5 of this year, Ashley said, she received an email that her offender's request ""to observe a graduation ceremony on MSU's East Lansing campus"" this weekend had been granted. Ashley said she had no way to appeal that decision.""I feel like MSU has failed me again,"" Ashley said. ""They're allowing him back like it doesn't matter.""A Michigan State official said the university is limited in what information it can share, but did confirm that the expelled student has been granted permission to attend his brother's graduation. He ""will be in the company of his parents at all times,"" the official said."

(If you don't believe me, read his memoir, The Road to Home.) This week, as we celebrate both Teacher Appreciation Week and Mother's Day, I'd like to call out ""The One"" -- the one teacher whose encouragement and, yes, toughness, pushed me to always keep stretching for what might be possible.Frances Pearl Myers, n√©e Davis, was born in Pomeroy, Washington in 1916. She spent most of her life in Seattle, and played the viola and the piano. In 1940, she received her bachelor's in French and Latin studies from the University of Washington. Her sophomore yearbook says she ""recuperates from studies by playing around the house with the kid sisters... with a million dollars, she'd go to France to study French, the better to teach it, my dear."" I don't think she ever made it to France, but she made it across the country for graduate studies at Columbia University, then Harvard, where in 1943 she earned her Master of Arts in Teaching -- an elite joint program of Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences.   In this letter to sister Dorothy (later first flutist for the Seattle Symphony), she writes from Ware Street in Cambridge, the snow ""blowing in whirls along the street and drifting on the curbs. Every once in a while the snowplows drive thru and turn back the snow just like a boat turns back water.""Thankfully for me, Mrs. Myers, as I knew her, returned to Washington state, teaching some 25 years' worth of high school students how to (aim to) write like that. All I cared about then was classical piano, and I thought I'd go to conservatory. Mrs. Myers stopped me in my tracks, calling me out on writing that was uninspired, and, worse, she said, lacked clarity and meaning. Whether I studied music, she said, or pre-med, which was sort of the plan, I absolutely had to learn the value and power of expression, and how art and the humanities, science and math, were all connected. She planted the idea that led to my careers in journalism and communications -- that by broadening my interests and knowledge, I could aim to tell people stories they would not otherwise hear.  This week's #ThankATeacher hashtag made me think of Mrs. Myers for the umpteenth time since I left Seattle for Harvard myself in 1980. I'd been unable to reach her through my high school, but an exhaustive internet search brought up a 98-year-old Frances Myers living in Seattle! I found a number for Gene Myers, who turned out to be her son. Sadly, Gene informed that his mother had passed away.  But he also told me so much about his mother that I hadn't known (and shared the images you're seeing here). About her own musical pursuits, and her time in New York and at Harvard. How I wish I could have told her how my life has ended up mirroring hers in many ways -- not a coincidence, given her influence and encouragement as a model and mentor. Now, I'm saluting Frances Myers, the teacher that made the difference for me, in the hopes that her granddaughters, my daughter and anyone who's a student, will appreciate all that the best of our teachers do for us -- much more than we realize at the time. Thank you, Mrs. Myers... for everything."

AFP PHOTO / POOL / JACK GUEZ (Photo credit should read JACK GUEZ/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14c2f2300005000d0c8bc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Each week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. This week, we spoke with Moaz Rosenthal, a political scientist at the Interdisciplinary Center in Israel's Herzliya, about Israel's new coalition government.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this week finally clinched a deal to form a new coalition government after his Likud party won elections last month.It was a dramatic final week of coalition negotiations. First, Avigdor Lieberman, formerly a close ally of Netanyahu, stunned political observers by announcing that his secular nationalist Yisrael Beitenu party would not join the coalition. As the clock ticked down to the deadline at midnight Wednesday, Netanyahu forged alliances with the nationalist Jewish Home party, the centrist Kulanu party, and several ultra-Orthodox parties. He pulled off another term in power, but his coalition has the narrowest of parliamentary majorities -- just one vote.The WorldPost spoke to Israeli political scientist Moaz Rosenthal about the main players and priorities of the new government, due to be sworn in next week.How long do you think this coalition government will survive with such a slim majority? People underestimate Netanyahu‚Äôs ability to do nothing for a long period of time. He can just do nothing and not agitate his coalition partners. The coalition partners also don‚Äôt want to go into another election.It might survive with just a lot of talk, living one drama to the next. This is how Netanyahu made it through his previous terms as premier. But it won‚Äôt last more than a couple of years at most.Can Netanyahu add more coalition partners later on? Legally he can add more partners, but the question is whether people will want to join. It's more likely that Netanyahu will find a way to add Lieberman‚Äôs party, either as part of a formal coalition or informally cooperating over specific votes. I don‚Äôt think the center-left Zionist Union have anything to gain from joining the coalition. It‚Äôs better for [Zionist Union leader Isaac] Herzog to wait for Netanyahu to crumble.Why did Lieberman decide not to join the opposition?Lieberman wanted several specific posts. Most people think it‚Äôs a personal problem between Netanyahu and Lieberman, but I think it‚Äôs based on Lieberman trying to best serve his interests.As well as keeping his own position of foreign minister, Lieberman wanted another key role for one of his party members -- head of the welfare committee in the Knesset. Lieberman is trying to reframe his Yisrael Beiteinu party as a rightist but pro-social welfare party, a bit like the European right-wing populist parties. But Netanyahu blocked the position.Lieberman‚Äôs career is not over. He‚Äôs a survivor.Lieberman also sees an opportunity here. This right-wing coalition will function under huge pressure, especially from the U.S. and Europe, to do something for the Palestinians. In opposition, Lieberman will be able to attack them if they do. He‚Äôs playing a game of chess, looking several steps down the road. He lost votes in the last election because centrist voters were turned off by a slew of corruption scandals in his party, and demographic trends are depleting his core base of former Soviet Union immigrants. He‚Äôs looking for new constituencies. Lieberman‚Äôs career is not over. He‚Äôs a survivor.Have Netanyahu and Likud emerged from these elections stronger or weaker than before? Did Netanyahu miscalculate by calling this election?Netanyahu lives from one decision to the next. He did make a mistake by calling early elections. He was playing a game of chicken. But, he wasn‚Äôt able to get the coalition he wanted because Lieberman vetoed it.Netanyahu's problem is that he veered right during the campaign to get more votes. You can‚Äôt call the center-left traitors and then form a coalition with them five minutes later. You at least have to wait a while.What will this coalition government's priorities be? Their first priority is to decrease the cost of living and solve the housing crisis. Mostly, this is just implementing policies that are already in place. The coalition is in agreement on that point.Below the radar, the settlements will expand and funding for settlements will increase. Naftali Bennett‚Äôs nationalist Jewish Home party took all the key positions to make this happen.The ultra-Orthodox parties will pursue their priorities, which include removing the threat of criminal charges for ultra-Orthodox youth you don‚Äôt sign up to the army or go to Yeshiva [religious seminary], increasing funding for the ultra-Orthodox education system and maintaining control of the national body that regulates personal status issues in Israel, like marriage and divorce.All the economic reforms that Netanyahu promised during the election campaign cannot happen. As soon as he does something a coalition partner doesn‚Äôt like, they can threaten to bring down the coalition. What do you see as the main sources of tension within the coalition?A battle is brewing over the role of the Israeli Supreme Court, which is one of the most interventionist in the world after the U.S. Supreme Court. The Jewish Home party wants to decrease the power of the Israeli Supreme Court to intervene in government decisions, and now a senior member of the party will become the justice minister. Yet some Likud members and another coalition partner -- the Kulanu party -- are opposed to curbing the Supreme Court.Like the Titanic, the ship seems to be sailing forward, but it‚Äôs heading toward an iceberg.While the Palestinian territories were not a big electoral issue, pressure from the White House can strain U.S.-Israel relations and bring public pressure on the government to make at least symbolic measures toward peace. The government may come under pressure to freeze settlement construction for a while, but a large part of the current coalition would not accept that.Another source of tension is the ultra-Orthodox policies. Almost any issue could become a controversy, but Netanyahu can still survive it all.What does this election indicate about the health of Israeli democracy? This election casts a huge shadow over Israel. It highlights how Israeli democracy is highly representative, but these institutions keep producing governments that can‚Äôt govern. Israel is not a two-party system, nor should it be, as Israel is a highly cleavaged society. But there needs to be a dominant party in government that can actually govern and be accountable to Israeli voters.The politicians find a way to make it through the day, but the public sector is dysfunctional. Like the Titanic, the ship seems to be sailing forward, but it‚Äôs heading toward an iceberg. The Israeli system is not equipped to deal with a huge crisis, whether it's a economic, social or diplomatic crisis.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.More from The WorldPost's Weekly Interview Series: "

The Supreme Court is set to hear historic arguments in cases that could make same-sex marriage the law of the land. The justices are meeting Tuesday to offer the first public indication of where they stand in the dispute over whether states can continue defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman, or whether the Constitution gives gay and lesbian couples the right to marry. ( AP Photo/Jose Luis Magana)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafdb443c000032000ba7f4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last October, Kansas couple Philip and Sandra Unruh accused gay couples of trying to literally steal their marriage. In a motion to intervene in an unfolding case challenging their state‚Äôs ban on same-sex marriage, they referred to their marriage as property, and argued that if the state changes the definition of marriage to include same-sex couples, it would be tantamount to taking that property away. ‚ÄúA ruling extending marriage to same sex relationships would deprive the Unruhs of a property right without due process of law,‚Äù the motion read.A month later, Don Boyd, a man from South Carolina, went one step further. If his state legalized same-sex marriage, Boyd argued in a similar motion to intervene in his state‚Äôs marriage case, it would steal away his ability to worship God. In the motion, Boyd described himself as an appointed ‚ÄúWatchmen of the souls of the people errantly calling themselves lesbian and gay‚Äù and made clear that he did not plan to stand by and do nothing if gays and lesbians began to wed. ‚ÄúAny ratifying of gay 'marriage,'"" he wrote, ‚Äúwould compel me to leave off worshipping THE LORD with music and psalms -- free exercise of my religion -- to assume the life of a protester and wedding crasher.‚ÄùLast week, Sylvia Ann Driskell, a 66-year-old from Auburn, Nebraska, outdid both Boyd and the Unruhs. In a seven-page handwritten complaint, rife with misspellings, delivered to a federal court in Omaha, Driskell brought suit against all homosexuals in the world. The matter Driskell hopes the court will decide is whether homosexuality is a sin. (Her own view on the matter is clear: It is ""an abomination,‚Äù she wrote.)Driskell was not acting alone, according to her complaint, but serving as the appointed ‚Äúambassador‚Äù for ‚Äúplaintiffs God and His Son, Jesus Christ.‚Äù Driskell does not cite case law or legal precedent, but instead relies heavily on biblical citations and her own views.""I‚Äôm sixty six years old an I never thought that I would see the day in which our Great Nation or Our Great State of Nebraska would become so compliant to the complicity of some peoples lewd behavior,‚Äù Driskell wrote. ‚ÄúLook what happen to Sodom and Gomorrah two city because of the same immoral behavior thats present in Our Nation, in Our States, and our Cities; God destroy them.‚ÄùThe idea of filing a suit against homosexuality itself is a strange one, but it is not new. Back in 2013, anti-gay activist Peter LaBarbera mused on a radio show about the possibility of a class action lawsuit against the sexual orientation. ‚ÄúWe always wanted to see one of the kid in high school who was counseled by the official school counselor to just be gay, then he comes down with HIV,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut we never really got the client for that.‚Äù As opponents of same-sex marriage have suffered loss after loss in the courts and in public opinion, activists have struggled to explain to Americans why they should continue to care about same-sex marriage. All three suits seek to answer a basic question: How, exactly, does legalizing same-sex marriage affect anyone who isn‚Äôt gay? Or, as Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan put it in oral arguments over California‚Äôs ban on same-sex marriage in 2013, ‚ÄúHow does this cause and effect work?‚ÄùThe documents recall a time when it was enough to simply quote the Bible. Looking over Driskell‚Äôs complaint, Jennifer Pizer, a lawyer with LGBT advocacy group Lambda Legal, reflected, ‚ÄúI see it as a marker of a shift from a time when judges, including justices of the Supreme Court, referenced the Bible in denying gay people equal rights, to a time when a case like Driskell‚Äôs, while based on some similar views, is seen as a bizarre outlier.‚ÄùIn 1986, when Pizer was a law student, the Supreme Court ruled in Bowers v. Hardwick that laws banning sodomy were constitutional. Chief Justice Warren Burger wrote that the decision was based on ‚ÄúJudeo-Christian moral and ethical standards‚Äù and that affirming a constitutional right to sodomy ""would be to cast aside millennia of moral teaching."" This decision was reversed in 2003.No matter how outlandish the complaints from Driskell, Boyd and the Unruhs seem today, Pizer added, the views are not unique. Since the Supreme Court struck down the federal government‚Äôs ban on recognizing same-sex marriage in 2013, religious conservatives around the country have ramped up efforts to pass laws that protect religious people from participating in same-sex marriages. ‚ÄúI see these lawsuits as an outlier manifestation of a view that too many people in this country do still have, and you see those views reflected in state legislation,‚Äù Pizer said.It is exceedingly unlikely that Driskell‚Äôs suit will be a win of any kind for opponents of same-sex marriage. Driskell did not respond to request for comment, and same-sex marriage opponents seem wary of associating themselves with her cause. As Horatio G. Mihet, a lawyer with the conservative religious legal group Liberty Counsel, put it in an email, ‚ÄúAs you know, Liberty Counsel strongly supports natural marriage, and the right of every child to have both, a mom and dad. That said, we have no comment on this particular story.‚ÄùOn Wednesday, Judge John M. Gerrard of the U.S. District Court for Nebraska dismissed the case. ‚ÄúTo the extent that she asks for anything from the Court, it is a declaration that homosexuality is sinful -- a question that the Court cannot answer,‚Äù the memorandum reads. ‚ÄúThe Court may decide what is lawful, not what is sinful.‚ÄùPizer, for her part, was pleased. ‚ÄúHer complaint tried to pull back the tide of history, and the court has neither the ability nor the authority to do that.‚Äù "

""We will not let you down.""Scots voted 55-45 against independence in a referendum last September, but the SNP's energetic campaigning still convinced many Scots, even some who do not want independence, that it was the best party to represent them in the British parliament.In the short term, it is unclear how the SNP can keep Sturgeon's promise against a Conservative government with a clear majority and the power to pass any budget that it wants.In the longer term, the spectacle of 58 out of 59 Scottish members of parliament being repeatedly outvoted in Westminster will do nothing to quell independence aspirations.If, in 2017, Britain votes to leave the European Union in the referendum that Cameron has promised, while most Scots vote to stay in, that sentiment will only grow.ANOTHER INDEPENDENCE VOTE?Though the SNP leadership have worked for independence all their lives, Sturgeon, Scotland's first minister, has given different signals on whether she will pledge another secession referendum when she stands for re-election in the Scottish regional assembly in May 2016.Alex Salmond, the 60-year-old former head of the SNP now newly elected as an SNP lawmaker in London, told reporters after Sturgeon's speech that he would ""absolutely"" see independence in his lifetime.On the eve of September's referendum, Scotland was promised additional taxation rights, and bills giving it the power to set income tax rates and influence welfare spending are now due to be passed.On announcing the formation of his new government outside Number 10 Downing Street on Thursday, Cameron pledged to keep the United Kingdom together by devolving more powers to Scotland, but with fairness for England, which has no regional government akin to those of Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland.""In Scotland, our plans are to create the strongest devolved government anywhere in the world with important powers over taxation,"" Cameron said, adding: ""No constitutional settlement will be complete if it did not offer also fairness to England.""But many Scots and some English already see their countries drifting apart.""Scotland and England are on different tracks now, and I think independence is just a matter of time,"" said Will Fleming, who lives in Edinburgh and voted SNP.""This election wasn't about another independence referendum, but I think it's inevitable that we will go our separate ways.""

There will always be a time and place for contemplation and inquiry, but there is no wiser teacher than the present moment.",2015-05-09,There are no signposts in the sea. Katwijk Netherlands www.erikschepers.com,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb800bb220000ba01dd36cf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My mom has no religious affiliation, and yet she is one of the most spiritual people I know. She helped me develop a strong spiritual foundation as a child and continues to play an active role in helping me make sense of my world, even as I've moved hundreds of miles away and embarked on this strange journey we call adulthood.These eight spiritual truths have been among the most formative lessons I've learned in my life thus far, and I have to thank my wonderful and wise mother for sharing them with me:   1. You are not alone. Whenever I got scared or felt insecure as a little girl, my mom would tell me, ""Your spirit guides are watching over you."" I didn't know who these protective beings were, but I felt their presence and knew that they would see me through whatever challenges I faced. With these words my mom gave me an extraordinary gift -- the enduring feeling of security and protection, even when I didn't know exactly who or what might be out there wishing me well.2. Trust your gut. My mom is acutely intuitive. When she tells me she has a feeling about something, I don't question it. Even more startling, though, is the fact that she sees nothing unusual in her ability. She thinks everyone has the capacity for intuition, if we learn how to listen to ourselves. Throughout my life, my mom encouraged me to ""go inside"" and ask myself whatever query might be in my heart. I've done it time and time again, and it almost never fails.3. Your life is not an isolated event. Whether you believe in past lives and reincarnation (which my mom absolutely does) or if you think this is the one shot we get, it's nice to feel that our lives aren't discrete, stand-alone events. They're part of the fabric of existence, woven together with every other being we encounter. Because we were raised with the concept of reincarnation, my siblings and I developed a strong understanding that our souls are on long and winding journeys -- a powerful antidote to any jadedness that could have arisen.4. Listen to and learn from nature. My mom always told me that when I was a baby, she and my dad baptized me in the ocean in Southern California. She said it with such gravity and used the religious concept of baptism to impart, I think, a larger lesson about human beings' connection to nature. We did not pick flowers and or kill bugs; we collected excess water from our showers to pour on the rosebush in the front yard. The earth plays an essential role in my spirituality to this day.5. Mind your dreams. Have you ever woken up from a really vivid dream and wished someone could help you parse it out? That is something my mom has done for me over and over. She has filled everything from notebook pages to restaurant napkins with mindmaps, helping me explore my inner world through dream symbolism. She taught me to keep a dream journal and take note of recurring themes. The wisdom contained within these stories, however fragmented they may be, can be truly illuminating.6. Don't fear death. My mom has never seemed to me like someone who is afraid of death. If, after all, we believe that life is not isolated to the present reality, then death is not an end but perhaps just another rite of passage we walk through on this long journey of being. Throughout my childhood my grandfather, who died when I was baby, always seemed to be just beyond the veil. The way my mom talked about him made me feel that he was here, somewhere, within reach.7. You have a life purpose. Deep in a drawer in my mom's office is a beautiful, hand-drawn astrology chart she made me when I was born. Each planet has its unique position on the wheel, mapping its meaning onto the page which acts as a blueprint for what may come. In long conversations about my chart and the potentialities it suggests for my life, my mom has helped me recognize the importance of being exactly who I am and striving toward my goals. I am, after all, the only one of me.8. Give in to the moment. In not so many words, my mom has showed me over and over again: We are the people who dance, revel, play and explore. Hers is a kind of ecstatic spirituality that welcomes emotion and sensation. There will always be a time and place for contemplation and inquiry, but there is no wiser teacher than the present moment."

Not so much any more. Case in point is this week's new entry Kill Me Now, hosted by veteran standup Judy Gold.Her debut guest is comedian and writer Frank Conniff and, along with co-host/board op Lauren Hennessey, the trio makes their way hilariously through the kind of technical glitches and awkwardness almost every podcast is prone to in the early going.As Gold explains, the title is derived from her number one personal catchphrase in life, which gets used a lot in this show as well, under the heading of ""That's another 'kill me now' moment!"" As a comedian with three decades under her belt -- and some acting work as well, as witnessed in her recent turn in this season's Louie as a lesbian mother-to-be -- getting up to speed in this audio medium should be a snap.Gold is loud and brassy and makes no pretense about this being her show. (Co-host Hennessy seems to be so in name only, as Gold is forever capping on him whenever he tries to steer the conversation with their guest.) Conniff, on the other hand -- and although he comes off as a bit soft-spoken and reserved -- has been friends with Gold for years and clearly knows how to wait her out in their back-and-forth to place some great comedic shots in an almost Jack Bennyesque use of the occasional empty space.We found out things about his background that fans of the Mystery Science Theater alumnus might not know -- including the news that a recent young lady in his life is currently doing jail time -- and there are a couple of installments featuring Gold's mother's voicemail messages to her daughter.Funny from the get-go, Gold's show will no doubt get sharper and more hilarious in no time at all.--Podcasts I'm also listening to this week: Tiny Odd Conversations: Whenniversary, and Rooster Teeth Podcast #322--This review originally posted as part of This Week In Comedy Podcasts on Splitsider.com."

She finished her studies at Columbia Law School, after moving to New York for her husband's job, and graduated tied for valedictorian in 1959.Despite her remarkable academic achievement, Ginsburg was unable to land a clerkship with Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter because Frankfurter said that he was not yet ready to hire a woman. She went on to found the Women's Rights Project at the American Civil Liberties Union. As the ACLU's general counsel from 1972 to 1980, she worked on landmark cases before the Supreme Court that led to the removal of laws that treated men and women differently. Ginsburg was the principal author of a brief on behalf of a female plaintiff in a case called Reed v. Reed, in which the court struck down an Idaho law that said only men could be administrators of an estate. It was the first time the court applied the 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection, to laws that discriminated based on sex.She also helped establish the ""intermediate scrutiny"" standard, which the Supreme Court now uses to review laws that discriminate based on gender."

Pradhan's diary can be found on his Facebook page. I did a joint interview with the couple via email.  What is most needed right now in Nepal in the short term?  People have been living under tarpaulin temporary makeshift shelters for almost two weeks since the quake. They need now to move into more permanent and safer shelters, as in next few months it will be monsoon [season] in Nepal. What supplies are needed in order to rebuild?  Relief materials like corrugated sheets, prefabricated boards should be used so that they can be used for rebuilding long-term shelters or houses. Using tents or tarpaulins for immediate relief is fine, but in the long-term such materials are not cost-effective and environment friendly in the rural areas.And the other thing [is doing what] some of the rural folks are already doing -- recycling the building materials from destroyed houses and buildings. It will be cost effective to use locally available resources and building materials such as bamboo [and] clay soils.Another urgent need is to deploy reliable structural engineers in the rural areas to check the houses [to see if] they can move back or not.What are the misconceptions of international media coverage of the situation on the ground?   The international media like CNN and BBC did [a] good [job] by quickly putting the crisis in Nepal on [the] international media radar, but there was this misperception and misreporting by international media that the government in Nepal was not able to coordinate properly and [was] holding back relief supplies at the airport. The government...was in fact trying to ""coordinate"" and not control, trying to avoid unprecedented activities that tend to happen in such a situation. The international media, rather than just listening to the version [told by] the aid missions and donors, should have taken some time to listen to the government.What options do Nepalis who are far from treatment centers have?  There have been mobile medical camps and relief. Besides the medical teams from Nepal, there are medical teams from other countries who have come to aid and are travelling to the remote areas and organizing medical camps. International medical missions like Doctors Without Borders are here in Nepal to help.What are the health risks in Nepal following the earthquake?  In the aftermath of natural disasters it is said epidemics happen, but can be avoided or prevented if people are made aware of hygiene, especially with water [and] food. Many development agencies in Nepal who have worked on sanitation and hygiene are working on this, and the Ministry of Health has already started health awareness campaigns through various media like radio, television and other extension workers in the field. How are the ethnic enclaves of Bhutanese and Tibetans holding up? Are they getting help?  Well, if you talk about ethnic enclaves in Nepal, then there are more than 40 ethnic groups, many of whom are marginalized. What me, my wife and [our] families were trying to do was reach out to those who are marginalized, regardless of what ethnic groups they belong to. We were trying to fill in the gaps and connect the dots. I am sure that ethnic enclaves of Bhutanese and Tibetans are holding up fine, as even if no government or foreign aid has reached them, diaspora Nepali or Bhutanese and Tibetans have sent in help. Besides, the Bhutanese and Tibetans in Nepal are located in more accessible areas and are more likely to be covered than others in very remote areas.There have been reports of bureaucracy and corruption with funds and supplies being stopped from going where they are needed.  I have not come across anybody asking for money or something like that when we supplied relief to the villages in [the] past 13 days. But politicization of the relief materials through the government's decentralized mechanism has been observed -- where the relief is being distributed through the political party committees at the national and local levels. What should international donors know about the needs of Nepal?  International donors have to listen to what the disaster-affected people need on the ground. Talk with them and listen to them. Don't dump the people with what you think is needed or the expert thinks is needed. Listen to the people and act likewise, as the people know best what works for them. With tourism such a huge part of the local economy, what can be done now that revenue has dried up, jeopardizing Nepal's long-term recovery? The tourism sector...is a large economic sector in Nepal, but it's not completely dependent on the government but on the private sector as well. So the government, private sectors and international sectors that love Nepal should get together. The government has to provide an enabling environment and support. We still have the Himalayas, nature, cultural diversity, and the people's resilience to serve tourists, so come back!Photo credits: Kishor Pradhan.

What me, my wife and [our] families were trying to do was reach out to those who are marginalized, regardless of what ethnic groups they belong to. We were trying to fill in the gaps and connect the dots. I am sure that ethnic enclaves of Bhutanese and Tibetans are holding up fine, as even if no government or foreign aid has reached them, diaspora Nepali or Bhutanese and Tibetans have sent in help. Besides, the Bhutanese and Tibetans in Nepal are located in more accessible areas and are more likely to be covered than others in very remote areas.There have been reports of bureaucracy and corruption with funds and supplies being stopped from going where they are needed.  I have not come across anybody asking for money or something like that when we supplied relief to the villages in [the] past 13 days. But politicization of the relief materials through the government's decentralized mechanism has been observed -- where the relief is being distributed through the political party committees at the national and local levels. What should international donors know about the needs of Nepal?  International donors have to listen to what the disaster-affected people need on the ground. Talk with them and listen to them. Don't dump the people with what you think is needed or the expert thinks is needed. Listen to the people and act likewise, as the people know best what works for them. With tourism such a huge part of the local economy, what can be done now that revenue has dried up, jeopardizing Nepal's long-term recovery? The tourism sector...is a large economic sector in Nepal, but it's not completely dependent on the government but on the private sector as well. So the government, private sectors and international sectors that love Nepal should get together. The government has to provide an enabling environment and support. We still have the Himalayas, nature, cultural diversity, and the people's resilience to serve tourists, so come back!Photo credits: Kishor Pradhan.

She left us way too soon, 27 years ago. None of us thought dad would last a year without her. We were so wrong.She has been on my mind a lot, as we've been watching dad die by inches for the past three years. I'm not sure what he's hanging onto, or if mom is somewhere peacefully blocking passage, but none of us could have imagined it this way.My mother-in-law was a breath of fresh air. The woman would spell D A R N in front of my kids, which always made me laugh.Then there was the day she made me choke on my morning coffee relaying how she learned what f*&k meant. I'm not kidding.As her story went, after a few months of marriage she asked dad what the word f*&k meant. She'd always thought it was an Italian word because it was the Italian boys who wrote it on the sidewalk where she grew up.""For Christ's sake! We've been doing it for three months and you don't know what it is?""You have to laugh!It's the big family events that really get me. When our oldest son Jeff got married 18 years ago I missed her more than I could have ever imagined. She would have adored his wife, Marcie, and Greg's wife, Marsha. When our 1st grandson was born I thought about mom constantly. She was such a wonderful grandmother... I couldn't possibly live up to her standard, could I?She would have laughed, as we do, about having only boys in our family. Four grandsons and three great-grandsons seemed like a pattern. But when the 1st great-granddaughter, Caylee was born 5 years ago, I know mom would have been over the moon with joy for my sister-in-law and her family! Now they have 2 beautiful girls mom would have adored.Sally Hammond was a lady and a wonderful homemaker. She did not like being called a housewife, thank you very much. Home was her domain and she took it very seriously. I could never measure up.So Mom, if you're watching and listening, I'm blowing you a kiss and sending you much love for all you were and still are to me."

Part radical jihadists and part revolutionary government, IS, in the space of eighteen months, appears to have carved out a territorial domain comparable to that of Great Britain, with a population of over eight million people. Equally at home with cutting edge social media, while advocating a return to a more traditional Muslim society, it is rapidly transforming its domain into a twenty-first century reincarnation of a twelfth century Islamic caliphate.In the process IS has morphed into a political entity never before seen -- partly a nation state, or at least a proto-nation state, and partly, a radical, Salafist inspired, jihadist movement -- committed to a revolutionary strategy of creating a new Islamic caliphate in the historic lands of the Muslim Arab Empires of the ninth to the thirteenth century. This new caliphate, stretching from the Iberian Peninsula to the Indian subcontinent, is but a first step toward its declared strategy of a worldwide conquest that will ultimately lead to the Islamization of the globe. Passports Issued by Islamic StateIt has amassed billions of dollars in assets and, what appears, at least on paper, to be a well armed, formidable army. In the process, not only has it plunged both Syria and Iraq into civil war, but has made them the epicenter of a broader Sunni-Shia rivalry that threatens to plunge the Muslim world into a global conflict. Its unspeakable brutality, its genocidal policies, and its murderous record are unmatched by any regime since Pol Pot or Nazi Germany. Its rise has upended the traditional politics of the Middle East, creating tensions between long standing allies while making reluctant, if not surreptitious, collaborators of longstanding rivals like the United States and Iran.What exactly is the Islamic State? One possible definition is that it is in fact a new nation state; one that incorporates portions of Iraq and Syria. It has a capital, Raqqa, and it behaves like any other newly emerging country. It issues passports, prints its own currency and has an army. It provides government and administrative services over the territory it controls, albeit not always very efficiently. It does not have a diplomatic service in the conventional sense, no embassies, no ambassadors, although it does have approximately two-dozen ""franchises"" or affiliated jihadist movements around the world. Geographic Boundaries of Islamic State as of May 1, 2015As a new or ""proto-nation"" state it controls an area of approximately 80,000 square miles with a theoretical population of seven to eight million people. I say theoretical, because a significant number of those ""citizens"" are refugees and have been displaced. It is unclear how many still reside in the geographic area controlled by Islamic State. An alternative definition is to see Islamic State as little more than a collection of two-dozen or so urban centers and the roads that connect them. Viewed in this way, IS appears to be less of a nation state, even an incipient one, and more of an extended, particularly virulent urban insurgency. In this case, Islamic State has a tenuous control over a territory of less than 10,000 square miles with a population, at most, of three to four million people. Alternative Depiction of Islamic State Territory. Image courtesy Institute for the Study of WarThe main difference between the two visualizations of Islamic State is that in the second case, large portions of territory consisting primarily of the Syrian Desert are excluded. The key to controlling this area is control of the roads that bisect it. By controlling the major cities and towns in the region, IS controls access to the road network and the key road junctions. This control prevents the Iraqi government from projecting military force or its political authority into this sector. The Syrian Desert is relatively flat and stony but it is bisected by deep wadis that make it problematic for the off road use by wheeled vehicles. The preponderance of U.S. airpower over the Syrian Desert means that notwithstanding its control of the road network in the region, Islamic State is constrained from moving men and equipment through the desert. The result is that the desert region is a sort of no man's land. Neither Baghdad nor Islamic State can consistently project their military power into the region very effectively.A third option is to see Islamic State as the core of a new Islamic empire that it believes will stretch from the Iberian Peninsula to Sir Lanka by 2020. The map below made quite a splash when it was released in 2014. A close scrutiny, however, reveals a number of anomalous features. Islamic State's Projection of Its Territory by 2020Sicily and Malta, both part of the Fatimid Empire during the ninth and tenth centuries are excluded from this new Islamic Empire. Galicia in northwest Spain, the only Christian kingdom to have escaped conquest by the Moors as a result of its victory at the battle of Covadonga in 722 is, however, included. On the other side of Europe, Vienna, which twice successfully resisted sieges by the Ottoman Turks in 1529 and 1683, is also included. I guess the third time is the charm.A broad area of central Africa, from the Gulf of Guinea to the Indian Ocean is included. This is a region that is culturally Islamic, although not exclusively so, and which was never incorporated into the historic Arab Muslim empires. Tanzania and the Comoros, however, both overwhelmingly culturally Islamic, are excluded. South India and Sri Lanka are included, even though these regions exhibit only residual Islamic cultural influences, notwithstanding the fact that South India did produce some Muslim kingdoms from the thirteenth through the fifteenth centuries, and were never part of any of the Arab Muslim empires. Indonesia, the world's most populous Islamic State, Malaysia, and the Thai portions of the Malay Peninsula, all regions that exhibit broad, strong Islamic cultural influences are not included.For a movement that sees itself as the leading edge of the revival of Islamic power and glory in the world, the map seems to have been designed by someone remarkably ignorant of Islamic history. Perhaps it is less an example of strategic intent and more a PR stunt designed to rattle the world's cage.Either way, it underscores the fact that Islamic State does not fit into any neat pigeon holes. It may be a proto-nation or even the core of a new proto-empire. It is certainly more than just a militant jihadist movement.

(AP Photo/Mehmet Shakir)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c6f02400003200567fa6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In 2025, there will be more silence in the face of tyranny and that gathering silence will be our own fault. We will see more murders like the public beheading of the American freelance journalist James Foley, more messengers detained like the Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian who is being held on trumped up accusations in a Tehran prison simply for reporting the story of a changing Iran, and there will be more horrific attacks like the one at Charlie Hebdo in Paris. This dark vision for the future will be our own fault if we allow the attack on journalism around the world to go unchecked for another decade, if we continue to look the other way and ignore how killing the messenger erodes democracy and threatens a free, open society. It will be our fault if we don't speak out against journalists being threatened, detained and killed for doing their jobs in exposing injustice and questioning authority. And we will all suffer. Not just the journalists like Foley, who was my friend and colleague, but really all of us who want to know what is going on in the world, who rely on eyes on the ground to serve as witness to the biggest stories: terrorism, government corruption, income inequality, human trafficking and the imbalance between privacy and the public's right to know in the digital age. Already, the peril that journalists face in just about every corner of the world -- at the hands of Islamic extremists and police states and governments as well as corporations that seek to control the free flow of information -- has reached record levels. Last year, 61 journalists were killed. According to the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), since 1992, 1,124 journalists have been killed while doing their jobs. Both the International Press Institute (IPI) and the CPJ confirm that the last three years represent an unprecedented level of violence against journalists, particularly local journalists. Too often the attacks on journalists are carried out with impunity as more than 90 percent of the cases of murder against journalists around the world remain unsolved. This violence will intimidate journalists and silence voices who are needed for a vibrant free press. So the silencing of the voices that can speak out against tyranny will be our fault if those of us who care about freedom of expression don't come together to counter the forces trying to thwart the kind of journalism that dares to confront injustice, to shine a light on the darkest corners of the human condition in the most dangerous corners of the world. There are several practical approaches to counter the attack on journalism that are already underway and that need support. One is ""A Call for Global Safety Standards and Practices, or ""The Call,"" as it has been dubbed. This initiative has brought together nearly 70 media organizations and advocacy groups, including the BBC, AP, Reuters, the Guardian, GlobalPost, The GroundTruth Project, IPI and CPJ and many others to recognize the need for a new culture of safety for correspondents in the field, particularly freelancers. And there is a need for a change in international law to make the murder of a journalist or holding a journalist hostage a war crime, an idea I first heard articulated by the president of AP Gary Pruitt. Last year was a particularly deadly year for the AP, which saw four colleagues killed in the field, including the high-profile murder of Anja Niedringhaus, who was shot at point blank range by an Afghan gunmen dressed as a police officer while she was covering elections. Pruitt made the case at the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents Club, saying, """"They don't need us, they don't want us. They want to tell their story in their way from start to finish with nothing in between, and a journalist is a potential critical filter that they don't want to have around,"" he said. ""The larger world, however, needs us. They need us to get the real facts out or the complete story out. Not just one side as they want to tell it,"" he added.Another idea called for by UNESCO is to tie freedom of expression directly to the United Nations' millennium development goals, and make support for and protection of a free press a priority. UNESCO's head of External Relations, George Papagiannis, said, ""The digital age presents enormous challenges for those of us who care about freedom of expression."" Explaining that the digital age presents enormous hope and opportunity for a new era of journalism and an historic expansion of voices through citizen journalism, Pappagiannis hastened to add, ""There is at the same time a rise in censorship and an unprecedented effort to block journalists. There is intimidation and murder of journalists and an effort to silence.""Over the next 10 years, there is much work for all of us to do to ensure that a free press thrives. All of us who believe in freedom of expression and the idea that it provides the cornerstone for democracy and open, inclusive government, need to be vigilant and avoid that gathering silence and the darkness that comes with it.
