0,BUSINESS,Glenn Hubbard: 'Naive' To Think Fed Stimulus Can Solve Jobs Crisis,Jillian Berman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/glenn-hubbard-fed-stimulus_us_5bb2d3c3e4b0480ca65cd358,"“I would be much more comfortable if, in fact, Congress would take some of this burden from us and address those issues,"" Bernanke",2012-09-16,"395538 01: Glenn Hubbard, Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors to President George W. Bush, discussses his views of the condition of the U.S. economy and the Middle East conflict in an interview at his office October 5, 2001 in the Old Executive Office Building in Washington, DC. (Photo by Greg Whitesell/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2d3c32200005700dbb4c0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of Mitt Romney’s top economic advisers says that the Federal Reserve’s aggressive move last week may be more like a drop in the bucket. The Fed announced an aggressive stimulus program Thursday aimed at combating high unemployment and slow growth. The new round of bond-buying, or quantitative easing, has an open-ended duration. In addition, the Fed announced it would keep short-term interest rates near zero until 2015 -- a year longer than the central bank had promised previously. “I just don't think it’s going to be very effective at all,” Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia Business School and one of the Republican presidential candidate's main economic advisers, told The Huffington Post. “This is trying to use monetary policy to try and solve problems that are structural and fiscal.” But Fed chairman Ben Bernanke has said as much. When he testified before Congress in June he asked for lawmakers’ help in fighting the sluggish economy. “I would be much more comfortable if, in fact, Congress would take some of this burden from us and address those issues,"" Bernanke said at the time. When he announced the bond-buying program Thursday, Bernanke acknowledged that “it’s not going to solve the problem.” Hubbard echoed Bernanke’s assessment of the new round of bond-buying, telling HuffPost “it would be naive to believe that what the Fed has done will bring the economy to full employment.” Still, he didn’t blame the chairman for not being able to solve the country’s economic woes. Instead, he argued that the “uncertainty of fiscal policy” -- like whether tax rates are going to go up or down, and what budget and housing policy will look like in the next few years -- is what’s holding the economy back. “The two presidential candidates have diametrically different positions and it’s a question of which one prevails,” Hubbard said. While the Fed’s move may do little to change the economic outlook, according to Hubbard, it still sparked widespread criticism. Romney called the stimulus “artificial and ineffective,” while other critics went even further, claiming it would boost the risk of inflation. Some have even argued in the past that the Fed’s decision to try and boost the economy so close to an election may be a political move, but Hubbard said he doesn’t “question the chairman’s motives.” In fact, Hubbard has said in the past that Bernanke should “get every consideration” for another term. But that may only be the case if Obama wins a second term; Romney told Fox Business last month that if he's elected, he'll hire a new Fed chief."

But important new research released this week by Bruce D. Meyer of the University of Chicago and James X. Sullivan of the University of Notre Dame indicates that the official measure is giving us an extremely misleading view. In fact, poverty fell substantially over the past several decades before rising a bit during the Great Recession.Neither liberals nor conservatives have been eager to embrace this idea—the former to bolster support for new programs and the latter to dismiss the efficacy of what’s already been done. But as Meyer pointed out in a talk at the Brookings Institution on Thursday, the way the government measures poverty actually by definition excludes the possibility that public programs are lifting families out of poverty. The truth, when examined correctly, is that we’ve hit upon a very effective means of waging war on poverty—give money to poor people—and we could make even more progress by doing even more of it.The official poverty line was created in 1963 by food and nutrition economist Mollie Orshansky and hasn’t been updated since.Her method, though arguably appropriate at the time, is incredibly crude by modern standards. Her idea was to calculate the cost of a nutritionally adequate diet for a given-size family. Then she used the early-‘60s rule of thumb that food was about one-third the typical family’s budget. So calculate the income needed to prevent malnutrition, triple it, and there’s your poverty line. Needless to say, this has only a hazy relationship with modern living standards. Worse, because at the time there were few government programs designed to help the poor, it refers to income before taxes and cash transfer payments. The formula also neglects to include the value of in-kind public services such as food stamps and Medicaid, and smaller programs like housing vouchers.The problems with the poverty-line methodology are well known, but they are often thought to impact merely the level of poverty, rather than the change over time. Meyer and Sullivan challenge this assumption. They argue for starters that the standard inflation measure suffers from “outlet bias.” It fails, in other words, to adequately account for the rise of cheaper big box stores—exactly the kind of development most likely to benefit the poor. Merely making this inflation adjustment paints a brighter picture of living standards at the low end.They also show that public policy has made a big difference in the real poverty rate. Throughout the ’60s and ’70, the tax code was made friendlier to poor people. That was partially rolled back by Ronald Reagan in 1981, but then the 1986 tax reform changed the tide again by introducing the Earned Income Tax Credit. This important program—a form of wage subsidy for low-income families—pushed after-tax poverty down substantially in the early 1990s. The tax provisions of the 2009 stimulus bill, once again, made the after-tax situation of low-income households better looking than the official line’s pretax numbers would suggest. Social Security, especially through its disability insurance function, has also played a big role in pushing actual poverty between 1967 and 2010 down six percentage points more than the official stats say. Other cash transfers—unemployment Insurance, veterans’ benefits, “welfare,” workers’ comp—aren’t as big a deal, but still make a difference to the tune of one percentage point. What’s more, these safety net programs also smoothen the business cycle. When you include them in the calculation, poverty doesn’t rise as much during recessions or fall as sharply during recoveries.The authors also show that if you simply ignore income altogether and look at consumption—what people buy—things look even better. It’s not entirely clear why this would be. One theory is that people underreport government benefits they receive. Another is that they’re underreporting under-the-table income (perhaps to retain eligibility for benefits). Another factor is that consumption measures do a better job of capturing the existence of in-kind provision of social services—public housing, community health centers, and other efforts to give free or discounted goods to the poor. The demographics of poverty look different if you rely on consumption measures rather than income ones—fewer elderly poor and more poor members of married couple households.Given the demographic split, it seems clear that better data are needed to understand which populations really face the most severe needs. But whether you look at it in terms of consumption or income, the news is good. The impact of the recession aside, we’re clearly winning the decades-long war on poverty. We’re doing so in part because the economy is evolving in ways that are favorable to the poor, and in part because our government programs are effective. In particular, the not-very-complicated strategy of giving money to the poor through tax credits and Social Security has steadily pushed the poverty rate down over decades, while safety net programs help shelter people from recessions. It’s understandable that advocates like to underscore the severity of social problems. But at a time when many voters seem skeptical about the efficacy of government programs it’s worth saying that these programs work. Long-term investment in anti-poverty spending has done exactly what it is supposed to do."

Their battle was dramatized in the 2010 film ""The Social Network.""After agreeing to the cash-and-stock accord, the Winklevosses sought to undo it, saying it was fraudulent because Facebook hid information from them and that they deserved more money.In February, the brothers formed Winklevoss Capital as a vehicle to invest their personal wealth.

(AP Photo/Ronald Zak)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2344e2000003000ffd717.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the early 1990s, George Michael put out the song, ""Freedom 90"" which topped the charts and became an instant classic. With lyrics like, ""looks like the road to heaven, but it feels like the road to hell,"" he depicts in song the story of his own personal rise to super-stardom and how it leads to his feeling manipulated, conflicted and misrepresented, until of course, he discovers that he is the only one who is capable of granting himself the freedom he so desires.In his song, he reflects over his past and describes how some of his actions reluctantly made landmark status in rock-n-roll history. As an experienced, dyed-in-the-wool rock star, he sings, ""Some mistakes were built to last.""I remember how insightful those words were, how they made him seem more like a prophet to me than a songwriter.And ""prophet"" seemed an appropriate title being that years later he would be involved in an incident that would teach him -- in no uncertain terms -- what lasting mistakes end up looking like. Somehow, in a sweeping blast of publicized infamy, a very talented man with a gorgeous voice turned into someone who would forever be defined by a mistake he made that was not meant for our entertainment, and was certainly none of our business. George Michael's body of work may ascend to the heavens but our unforgiving memory will always make sure he is associated with that which we deemed regrettable -- an episode in a public restroom -- something I'm quite sure Mr. Michael would love to never be reminded of again. That boulder was certainly built to last.Same thing with Richard Gere. Great actor, good looking guy, best buds with H.H. The Dalai Lama, peaceful Buddhist dude -- and what else? Something with gerbils up the bum, right? Richard Gere may attain nirvana someday, but in our minds, he'll always be down here with the gerbils. No wonder Gere practices detachment. If not for spiritual freedom, then certainly to remove himself from us.And PeeWee Herman. Such a funny guy, right? But that's not all he is to us... no, not anymore. We have to ensure that he'll never be completely let off the hook. His big famous mistake must always be available for our rehashing and his humiliation must always be on call. Hey, he's the one who wanted to be famous, right?So, in the same way that celebrity status practically invites the judgmental insistence of the public, we must hope that, for the sake of these overly scrutinized human beings, they don't take it too personally.As it goes with time, eventually it heals all wounds. And if the mistake-maker was beloved enough prior to the deed that got their name scribed on to the wall of infamy, he or she may even be forgiven. Forgiven, but not forgotten. Just look at Bill Clinton. Furious at you? No. Associating you forever with Monica Lewinsky? Yes.And while we're judging, let's get some perspective on the whole ""mistake"" idea. Mistakes are not intentional. Sometimes, people are actually just doing private things that are only called mistakes after an entire world of watchers catches them doing it. Then, they're mistakes. Before they're labeled and spun into stories, versions and imaginative spin-offs, they're just events that happened to human beings. Sometimes those humans are famous, sometimes not.So, what about us non-famous humans who make mistakes? Who gets to rip us to shreds and never let us forget about it? Why, our friends, of course!And... what if our mistakes are less about grievous errors as they are about people who need to find fault in us, simply because -- for some -- finding vulnerable cracks and emotional fissures to pick apart in others is an irresistible guilty pleasure?Or, perhaps it's as easy as this: Putting people down makes us feel better about ourselves. Sometimes, it's just easier to see the mistake than to see the person. The mistake makes us feel superior, it's the ticket we use to kid ourselves into thinking we're better than someone else. What threatens us is not so much their mistake, but the idea that they might have benefited from the lesson of it and could actually be less vulnerable than we are. It's a mirror than very few want held to their faces.What's disconcerting is seeing the numbers of people who seem to be incapable of handling the emotional well-being and growth of others, be they strangers, friends or family. It's as if some people can't be happy unless someone else is sad, or, they can't be whole unless someone else is incomplete. We've all made mistakes. We either learn from them or we don't, but if we do, and we apply those lessons well, then I think the next step is to cut ourselves some slack, even if others are not as generous in the process. And while we're riding the forgiveness train, we might think of extending that courtesy to others, as well.In the same way that some mistakes are built to last, we must also believe that some mistakes are built to dissolve -- if we let them.As George Michael says:Freedom, I'll hold on to my freedom  May not be what you want from me  Just the way it's got to be  Freedom, Freedom"

Crocker | Permission proper ... ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2340f1f0000250123796f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The largest art weekend of the year in Chicago is upon us. Many galleries in the city synchronize their schedules to kick-off the Fall at the same time, Friday, Sept. 21, including the galleries of Monique Meloche's Gallery Weekend Chicago. In addition, the long-awaited international art fair, Expo Chicago, opens with the MCA's Vernissage on Wednesday, Sept. 19 before the fair opens its doors to the public on Thursday, Sept. 20. Running straight through until Sunday, Sept. 23, hundreds of galleries from around the world will be represented at Expo Chicago. Since Expo Chicago is in its first year and Gallery Weekend Chicago only in its second, this seems like a perfect time to go over my top ten tips for art gallery hopping, just in case it is your first time making the rounds. 1. Go! (Yes, Just go!) It can be intimidating if this is your first time to an art opening or art fair; but, despite some quirky old misconception that has hung around for way too long, art is not just for the rich or privileged. Art is for everyone. It's practically one of the Ten Commandments. By definition, art is for everyone. So, yes! Go and check it out.2. Enjoy the party. Openings and art fairs are as much about joy and celebration, as they are about art. The artists have been working long and hard leading up to this evening. This is their moment to shine, take a deep breath, step back and feel really good about what they have done. So join them! Breathe in, stroll around, have a drink, engage with the art and artists. Remember, it's a celebration for a huge job well done, so raise a glass and enjoy! 3. Look, and/or listen (um, but don't touch). Now that you have settled in and are feeling comfortable with your new-found hobby, take it in: look, listen, discover, roam, read, open your mind, tilt you head in bewilderment, laugh, scoff, be incredulous, be confused, be moved. But here's one thing not to be: disruptive to the art. For the ten years that I owned my glass gallery, at least once a week someone would come in and tap the glass sculpture with their long fingernails and say, ""Is this acrylic?"" That got old fast. 4. Make it a date night. No need to go it alone. Bring your friends, have a good time and look, laugh, question, and take it all in together. Gallery hopping is also an excellent date night option. Many great relationships have started this way and you get extra brownie points for being creative.5. What The... ? Can't make heads or tails of what is going on with that art piece? Ask the gallery owner. There are no stupid questions. And more importantly, the days of snobby gallery owners are over. If you have a question, are interested in learning something or are just truly baffled, ask it! It is a great way to make a connection with the gallery owner, particularly if you want to come back to the gallery for the next round of openings and feel like you have a personal ""in.""6.  Speak on it. Here's where things get good! You like it. Your friends hate it. That's the beginning of a great conversation that will carry over into a late dinner afterwards. Let the art spark your next great debate that will put our current politicians to shame.7. You have to kiss many frogs. OK, so you think you could create the same piece of artwork in your backyard. We get it. This particularly piece of artwork isn't for you. State your points, tell you friends, but there's no need to point, make fun, or generally be disrespectful. It's like dating. The pieces that you DO fall in love with only really mean something because you didn't like or connect with all the ones before. Accept that it's not for you and check out the next thing.8. Think layaway. Then it hits you. Shazammm! Whammo! You fall in love! This piece is for you. You know where it will go, you know you want it, and it is a gazillion dollars. Now what? Think layaway! Nine times out of ten, the gallery owner wants the artwork to have the perfect home with someone who loves it, rather than go in a mansion just because it matches the couch. If your love is sincere, any gallery owner worth their salt will work it out with you.9. Be genuine. Buy what you like. Like their snobby gallery owner counterparts, the days of snobby collectors are also gone. You don't want to be one of those types collecting because you are supposed to, because it is the artist that everyone else wants, because you want to rattle off names. Buy what you love. Buy what speaks to you. Buy art that will grow with you long term. You'll be thankful down the road. 10. Be careful, you just might be a collector.  Watch out! Art is an obsession for lots of people and you just might catch the bug. Head to Gallery Weekend Chicago (free and open to the public, Sept. 21 - 23) or International Expo Chicago ($20, a well worth it ticket fee for exposure to galleries, art and lectures, including The Dinner Party, from around the globe, Sept. 20 - 23 at Navy Pier) and open yourself to a whole new world. You just might like it."
7,DIVORCE,Seven Reasons To Forgive Your Ex,"Eileen Barker, Contributor
Attorney-Mediator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/seven-reasons-to-forgive_us_5b9c45a7e4b03a1dcc7d7e28,"Forgiveness may seem like the last thing you'd want to consider when you are upset with your ex-spouse, but here are seven reasons why you should.",2012-09-15,Husband trying to give wife flowers and getting the cold shoulder.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c45a71f00002c002127f5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Let's face it -- it's hard to end a marriage without some degree of anger, resentment, disappointment or guilt creeping in. In the old days, it was expected that divorcing spouses would basically be enemies for the rest of their lives. We know now that is unnecessary. Most people, given the choice, want to have an amicable divorce. Yet, intense emotions such as anger, grief, fear and mistrust can make this difficult. In the face of strong and painful feelings, it can be hard to cooperate, co-parent effectively, or even participate in mediation. Once a divorce gets off to a rocky start, the situation can quickly spiral down. Many people find themselves caught in vicious cycles of hurt, anger and retaliation, even when they don't want to be. Left unchecked, many couples end up reenacting the ""War of the Roses,"" engaging in an endless stream of battles and spending tens of thousands of dollars on legal fees in the process. Even for cases that settle, it is common for each spouse to pay attorney fees of $50,000-$100,000 and much more. The good news is that it is never too late to change gears.It may surprise you to learn that one of the most effective tools -- especially in emotionally charged, high conflict divorces -- is forgiveness. Forgiveness may seem like the last thing you'd want to consider when you are upset with your ex-spouse, but here are seven reasons why you should:1. Forgiveness is for your own benefit, not the benefit of your ex. In fact, you need not ever tell your ex that you have forgiven, unless you choose to do so. 2. Forgiveness does not mean condoning bad behavior, and it does not mean forgetting what occurred. It does mean making peace with what has occurred so that you can put the past behind you.3. A good forgiveness process helps you turn the corner on feeling helpless and/or victimized by your ex, and shows you how to reclaim your power over your life and well-being.4. Forgiveness allows you to release difficult emotions, including blame, anger and grief - without denying or minimizing your feelings.  It provides a way to acknowledge them, heal and move on. 5. Anger and resentment are toxic to you and everyone around you. No matter how justified or right you feel, perpetuating conflict is not in anyone's best interest. Tons of scientific studies have proven that anger and resentment are damaging to your health and your happiness. 6. Divorce research shows that one of the most damaging aspects of divorce for children is being exposed to ongoing conflict and/or being placed in the middle of it. (This is not to say that you shouldn't protect yourself and your children if there is a threat of danger. Obviously you should, but protective action does not require hostility.) 7. The pleasure of getting even is short-lived. The best revenge is a happy life. As Oscar Wilde put it, ""Always forgive your enemies. Nothing infuriates them so."" Sooner or later, most people do want to resolve their marital conflicts and move on. So the question is, how long will you wait? How much suffering is enough? Who is your anger hurting? You don't need to wait until the divorce is final and all the dust settled. Forgiveness is possible -- and powerful -- at any stage.Years ago, when I led my first forgiveness training, one of the students told me she had just found out that her husband had been seeing another woman and announced that he was leaving her. She was adamant that she would never forgive him and didn't want to have anything do to with him, even though they still had a son in high school. In fact, she decided to work on a different conflict during the forgiveness class. However, when she returned to class the second day, she reported that everything had changed. After the first day of class she had come to understand her husband on a level she hadn't before seen. She said she had forgiven him and was now certain she would be able to have an amicable relationship with him and be well able to co-parent their son. She later reported that because of her forgiveness work, the process of getting divorced was relatively simple.Many people realize they need to forgive and want to forgive, but don't know how. Fortunately, there are many resources available. (For a free guide on ""How to Forgive Your Ex: 8 Essential Steps,"" click here.)Remember, it is never too soon or too late to forgive. Some people wait until years after the divorce is final, and others, like the woman in my class, forgive at the onset. The key is this: The past does not dictate the future unless you let it. Even if things have been very difficult in the past, you always have the ability to forgive in the present. When you do, you open a doorway to peace -- both inner and outer. And if even only one of you can see this, it will make a world of difference."

The 'Lehman Brothers: Artwork and Ephemera' sale will take place on September 29, 2010, on the second anniversary of the firm's bankruptcy, and comprises of artworks which hung on the walls of Lehman Brothers' offices in Europe. (Photo by Oli Scarff/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2d3b3200000e500000b57.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The collapse of Lehman Brothers four years ago today was the Pearl Harbor moment of a financial crisis that, over the next few months, threatened to bring down the entire U.S. financial system. Blame for the collapse is still being debated. People bought homes they couldn't afford, peddled by lenders who knew -- or should have known -- that the loans were destined to fail. Wall Street sucked up these loans and sold them off in bundles to investors, sometimes while making bets against those same products. Everyone should have known better. At the top of this list were the government regulators who are supposed to protect the economy from Wall Street excesses, but who instead sat and watched as a bubble built of rotten subprime loans kept expanding. After regulators forced the shotgun wedding of the investment bank Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase in March 2008, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Securities and Exchange Commission sent teams of observers to Lehman Brothers to gather information and monitor the company's condition. Like Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers had invested heavily in mortgage bonds. Instead of sharing their findings, however, as they had agreed to do, the regulators did what regulators too often do: behave like naughty 2-year-olds hoarding a new toy. Had they shared information, they would have discovered that Lehman's statements about the robustness of its liquidity were false, according to an independent examiner appointed by the bankruptcy court to determine what had gone wrong at Lehman.But they didn't see it coming. And when it finally became clear in the week before Lehman fell apart that disaster was imminent, regulators claimed that they didn't have the tools to prevent its collapse. Lehman's lawyers warned that an unplanned bankruptcy would lead to ""armageddon."" Regulators let it fall, only to watch in horror as the entire U.S. financial system began to unravel, and lending of all sorts came to a halt. It is impossible to say how the last four years would have unfolded had regulators, upon discovering Lehman's failings, sounded warnings earlier about the instability of the nation's largest banks. It is also not clear whether an orderly unwinding of Lehman from world financial markets would have significantly altered future events.But here is a safe bet, economists and financial crisis scholars say: The financial system hasn't yet been purged of greed, irrational exuberance or willful misconduct. Another crisis will come.Are regulators now better equipped to sniff out and prevent a disaster in advance -- or to manage the collapse of a major bank if they don't? Most of these experts I've spoken with recently say that the Obama administration's financial reform efforts have fallen fall short of their goals. They are also not convinced that our financial system could withstand the shock of the collapse of another major bank.""I don't see anything that has dramatically changed to keep this from happening again,"" said John Coffee, director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia University. ""All bubbles usually catch regulators on the blind side.""""I'm not all that optimistic,"" said David Skeel, a University of Pennsylvania law professor who has written extensively about the financial crisis. ""The longer we go without firm controls in place, the more dangerous it is.""By one important measure, the risks to the financial system of a bank collapse have only grown. That's because the banks themselves are even bigger than they were four years ago.Wells Fargo, for example, doubled in size when it swallowed Wachovia. It now serves 70 million customers and manages one out of every six mortgage loans.Bank of America's assets have increased to $2.1 trillion from $1.8 trillion in 2008.JPMorgan Chase, the biggest U.S. bank, with $2.3 trillion in assets, is nearly three times as big as it was in 2002, and intends to stay that way. ""There are huge benefits to size,"" CEO Jamie Dimon said this week. ""Big banks have a function in society."" His bank, he said, ""provided a port in the storm"" during the crisis.Dimon's argument -- which glosses over the fact that homeowners and small businesses weren't allowed to dock at his bank's port -- has some merit. There aren't many banks that can digest a $6 billion trading loss with barely a burp, as JPMorgan recently did. It is also true that the big banks that survived the crisis have paid off all of their government bailout money, while many of the smaller institutions have not.Still, as we learned during the crisis, size is no insulation against a full-fledged panic. The biggest banks are tied together through an endless series of loans, bets, side bets and even bets on whether each other's financial products -- investments that they don't even own -- will succeed or fail. Just because JPMorgan rode out the crisis better than most of its competitors doesn't mean that it would have done so had taxpayers not come to the rescue, pouring $700 billion into the financial system.'It's not hard to weather a storm if the government is propping you up,"" Skeel notes.STILL WAITING FOR REFORMAfter the health care overhaul law, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill, which Obama signed into law in July 2010, is probably the president's signature legislative achievement -- for better or worse.The law, in 2,319 pages, aims to do an awful lot. It creates a new federal bureaucracy, the Consumer Financial Protection Agency, to monitor the financial system for harmful products and practices. It lowers the fees that banks can charge merchants when a customer pays with a debit card. It seeks to lessen the dependence of the financial markets on credit rating agencies, which proved completely unreliable in their evaluation of financial instruments made out of mortgage loans. But viewed broadly, it seeks to accomplish two basic goals. First, give regulators the tools they didn't have the last time around to seize a faltering bank, and then break it apart in a way that doesn't spark a full-fledged financial panic. And second, make the financial markets more transparent, so that regulators have a better chance of spotting the next crisis before it bubbles over. On these fronts, Dodd-Frank has been less successful than many reformers hoped. In July, for example, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approved new rules that will allow regulators for the first time to monitor the domestic derivatives market. Yet regulators are still debating how to monitor derivative trading by U.S. banks that happens overseas. Worldwide, the trades on this market are valued at an incredible $648 trillion. On Thursday, CFTC Commissioner Mark Wetjen said in a speech that there is a ""very real danger that risks undertaken abroad can seriously impact the health of financial institutions, and the broader economy, here at home,"" according to The New York Times.That's because banks can also make bets on sovereign debt -- a literal gamble on whether a nation will default on what it owes. As of the end of July, five large American banks, including JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, had more than $80 billion of exposure to the European countries most likely to default -- Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece -- according to a New York Times analysis of the banks’ financial disclosures.The financial services industry has also flooded Washington with lobbyists who have worked feverishly to delay, weaken or block implementation of the Dodd-Frank reforms.In the first two quarters of 2012, for example, the American Bankers Association spent $4.6 million to lobby on topics including Dodd-Frank. Over the same period, the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, one of the consumer-focused groups fighting for Wall Street reform, spent less than $200,000. There's evidence that this money translates into better access to those crafting the rules. Between July 2010 and October 2011, bank lobbyists hoping to chip away at one key provision -- the so-called ""Volcker Rule"" that would force banks to stop most trading for their own benefit -- had met with federal regulators 347 times. Public interest, labor, and other pro-consumer advocacy organizations had 18 meetings with regulators over that span.So far, it appears the banking industry's lobbying push is working. As of Sept. 4, regulators had missed the deadline to finalize 145 regulations required by the law, according to the law firm Davis Polk. Fewer than one-third of the 398 rules mandated under the financial reform law are in place. Full implementation could take several more years. It is still too early to predict the outcomes of many of the fights over individual reforms. But the financial industry recently scored a big win, when SEC Commissioner Luis Aguilar sided with it by voting against an effort to tighten rules governing money market funds. These are the funds, promoted by investment companies like Fidelity and Vanguard, that traditionally were considered as safe as cash, but with a higher return. Soon after Lehman collapsed, however, one of these funds ""broke the buck,"" meaning that the value of investments slipped below the $1 break-even threshold. Regulators had wanted these investment firms to insure themselves against potential losses, but that didn't happen. As a result, these funds remain especially vulnerable to a ""run on the bank"" that could mean big losses for investors, said Coffee, the Columbia professor.Aguilar, who has otherwise been an advocate for tough regulations, was the third and deciding vote against the proposal. He is a former attorney for the money market industry.TOO BIG TO UNWINDPerhaps the biggest question involving financial reform is what regulators would do if another big bank, like Lehman, was teetering on the edge of collapse.Dodd-Frank created the Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of the lords of regulatory Washington, including Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro. The council has the power to seize a failing bank and unwind it in an orderly way. But as with so much else in the financial reform law, how that would happen in real-time is very much a mystery.Congress's intent was to end the notion that any bank could be “too big to fail.” This, said Skeel, is the ""thou shalt liquidate"" provision of the law. Those institutions deemed important to the financial system's stability are required to submit living wills to regulators. These roadmaps are intended to explain to regulators how to shut down a bank's business operations. Lehman Brothers didn't leave a will, and the bank's undertakers are still working to unwind all of its investments. In a recent report, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which would manage this unwinding, estimated that, had these new rules been in place in 2008, unsecured creditors of the parent company would be due far more than they are under the most recent bankruptcy plan -- 90 cents on every dollar of claims, compared with the roughly 20 cents they can now recover.The regulator's report imagines a past in which Lehman underwent an ""orderly liquidation"" instead of a sudden collapse. Despite the incredible complexity of such a process, the gains would have been ""vastly superior for systemic stability,"" according to the report, which also found that taxpayers and creditors would have been better off. Yet any liquidation would probably require a massive cash infusion, at least initially, in order to hold a bank together while it is broken apart, said Arthur Wilmarth, a banking law professor at George Washington University. ""If you try to accomplish something on the magnitude of Citigroup or Goldman Sachs, can you really contemplate that the FDIC can handle it without a disguised bailout?"" he asked. ""What will happen if all of them are in trouble?""Wilmarth said he didn't have an answer to his questions.""What we see is that the institutions are bigger than ever before and more complex than ever before. In terms of what we have accomplished, we are somewhat better off,"" he said. ""But I think there are still a lot of unanswered questions and [regulators] haven't been near tough enough.""

But we live in a dark age where any fiscal policy to create jobs is viewed as European socialism, despite the fact that Europe's even more austere than we are.",2012-09-15,Unemployed businesswoman with cardboard sign - job wanted.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2d3c22400005100972c53.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In discussions about the Fed actions, it occurred to me that many of the explanations that link the Fed's moves to stronger job growth leave out a number of steps in the middle. It's of course not the case that the Fed buys MBS or announces they'll keep rates low and jobs that weren't there before suddenly appear. There's a chain of events that needs to occur and there's plenty of slip twixt the cup and the lip.So let's talk about the process of job creation, both in normal times and in times like these.Demand for labor is so-called ""derived demand,"" derived from the demand for goods and services that firms sell to consumers and investors. That can be anything from a Snickers bar (consumer good) to a steel bar (intermediate good) to barroom (investment good). As I explained in greater detail here, in normal times, job creation is a function of a virtuous cycle where growth generates income which drives consumption, signaling investors to new opportunities, generating more growth, etc.But, of course, stuff happens and the cycle breaks down. There are big market failures, like the Great Recession. There are high levels of inequality that divert growth from reaching enough consumers to generate robust demand throughout the economy. There are inflationary supply shocks (e.g., an oil disruption) that sharply reduce real incomes.When that stuff happens, monetary and fiscal policies are needed to reset the cycle and a key part of that process is avoiding layoffs and adding new jobs. So how does that work?With the Fed, it works through lower interest rates. The Fed has a number of tools to lower the cost of borrowing, the idea being that this leads people to take out loans and make new investments that they wouldn't have undertaken at higher interest rates. And those new investments are associated with new jobs.So, a homebuyer takes advantage of a low mortgage rate, leading to jobs for homebuilders and real estate agents and furniture suppliers. A factory owner takes advantage of low rates to replace old equipment, creating jobs for machine manufacturers. An auto dealer invests in a redesigned show room, a buyer takes advantage of that dealer's low rates and buys a new car there, employing designers, salespeople, and auto suppliers.And those are just the direct jobs. The newly employed construction worker goes out for lunch near the job site, and the diner needs to add another worker (the jobs multiplier effect).Those are the links in the chain between monetary policy and jobs, but there are weak links. Low mortgage rates won't do much if the recession itself was a function of a housing bubble that left us with excess housing stock and deleveraging households (relatedly, with millions of homeowners underwater, the opportunity to refi into lower rates-another source of new demand-is also blocked). Even with very low borrowing costs, unless they see more consumer demand, investors won't see much return from taking on new projects. And with global opportunities, they can span the globe for better returns in economies where demand is stronger. In fact, corporate profitability in this recovery has largely been driven by foreign, as opposed to domestic, profits.What about fiscal policy? How does that chain work to create jobs and what are the weak links?Well, though economists tend to discuss fiscal policy as a lump, it actually comes in a lot of different flavors and they're not all created equal in terms of bang-for-buck job creation. Basically, the more indirect they are -- the more links in the chain between the policy and job creation--the less effective they are.For example, for a stimulative tax cut to create a job, a) the recipient must spend, not save, the money from the cut, and b) she must spend it on domestic goods (I mean, of course, that's what has to happen for the tax cut to create a job here as opposed to in China). Again, if you're in a deleveraging cycle, step ""a"" is a problem. Also, if your tax cuts go to wealthy people who are not income constrained in the first place, don't expect much in terms of job creation.Other fiscal measures have more reliable job-creation chains. Increasing unemployment benefits or food stamps helps because those folks typically spend the money. And new infrastructure is a pretty direct way to go. Same with state fiscal relief. I remember during the Recovery Act, mayors cancelling planned layoffs the day they received Recovery Act funds.The punch line is a simple one, but it's one that seems to have been forgotten amidst our increasing love affair in America with laissez-faire economics: the more direct the policy measure -- i.e., the fewer links in the chain between the policy and the job -- the better it will work.I've seen these processes at work close up and I've come to view this simple insight as a lot more important than I think most economists realize. Even Keynes had relatively little to say about implementation and the relative effectiveness of different types of stimulus. He famously quipped that if the government can't find something useful for people to do, just pay one group to bury bags of money and another group to dig them up.Ha-Ha. Very helpful, Sir K. But I actually think the great man was onto something. The most direct way to create jobs, the only surefire way to be sure that stimulus will work, is direct job creation. Everything else, including all the Federal Reserve stuff, involves crossing your fingers and hoping the chain holds.Of course, we live in a dark age where any fiscal policy to create jobs is viewed as European socialism, despite the fact that Europe's gone even more austere than we have. And even among the majority of economists who understand the need for stimulus, direct job creation by the government reeks of an earlier age, invokes boondoggles, and is way too interventionist. They'd rather give a tax cut and let consumer sovereignty and market forces take over.They're not crazy to feel that way. It would be better for consumer demand to signal which industries should expand and which should shrink. But we just don't always have that luxury, especially in a global economy where investments can flow abroad and import leakage dampens the impact of domestic tax cuts on job growth. And we especially can't count on that sort of stimulus when households are deleveraging.So, the next time we hit a recession, I'm going to be out there advocating for, if not direct jobs in the public service, something as close to that as we can get, like infrastructure, fiscal relief to states, and subsidized jobs for the disadvantaged.In fact, I'm not going to wait until the next recession. I'm starting now!This post originally appeared at Jared Bernstein's On The Economy blog."

And I promise you, the dawn is coming.""Summer is nearly over and the summer movie season is winding down to its customary clunker of a conclusion. The two films expected to achieve popular dominance, The Avengers and The Dark Knight Rises, both did. But tragedy intervened from the start to blunt the latter film's commercial impact -- it was on a near record opening weekend trajectory when madness struck (though having passed a billion dollars in global box office over Labor Day can hardly be a disappointment) -- and blur its cultural impact. There are, of course, major spoilers ahead, so please be aware.Consideration of The Dark Knight Rises and the trilogy of films it completes, has been obscured by the horrific shootings at its midnight debut in Aurora, Colorado. Naturally, our culture worried and kvetched endlessly and, in the end (which always comes when a tragedy is milked to its limit), did nothing about the tragedy, as I suggested would be the case at the time in The Dark Knight Shootings: ""All It Takes Is A Little Push.""Arguably the key scene in The Dark Knight Trilogy. In Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne returns after seven years away from Gotham traveling the world, determined to become an incorruptible and intimidating symbol.The Avengers is a fun and very entertaining film, a marketing triumph for Marvel's audacious plan to launch multiple superhero franchises and grow them not only for their own sake but for the ultimate goal of launching a superhero super-group. While it's amusing to spend time with the gang as they prepare to save New York from alien retribution/invasion, especially as they squabble like a '60s or '70s rock supergroup, the story is pretty lightweight. There are moments with this estimable cast, but anyone looking for much in the way of depth in the Marvel Cinematic Universe has to rely on the first Iron Man movie and last year's Captain America.In contrast to this, The Dark Knight Rises completes an epic journey into, yes, darkness, personal, social, and political. (With more than a dash of Bond in this 50th year of the film franchise, as it happens.) And in the end, it was darkest, as Harvey Dent proclaimed in The Dark Knight, just before the dawn. Just not for him.The Dark Knight showed that a comic book movie could be not only big, but epic. That it could thoughtfully engage major themes and concerns in society while providing a thoroughly satisfying entertainment experience. (Though clearly no easy answers on the big questions.) And that it could be one of the most popular films ever while doing it.The Dark Knight is one of my favorite films, arguably the key film of the past decade. The Dark Knight Rises, powered by Hans Zimmer's massive score, is busier, juggling multiple threads, but ends as a very satisfying and provocative conclusion to the trilogy.The Dark Knight Trilogy, which engages many aspects of contemporary culture, has one overarching storyline: Bruce Wayne's efforts to prevent the destruction of New York City.Each of the Nolan Batman films revolves around provocateurs and terrorists out to destroy Gotham, i.e., New York City, by bringing out its contradictions and, in the first and final films, finally wiping its people off the map. This is a New York far past the peak we see in the early '60s heyday period of Mad Men.New York has been deemed too corrupt and decadent to continue to exist by a highly sophisticated terrorist network. The League of Shadows is not Al Qaeda, but in its ascetic, bone-deep disdain for the lush life of Gotham -- more clearly than ever an analogue for Manhattan with all the scenes filmed there -- it has some similar concerns. When we meet the League in Batman Begins, it's based in a mountain fastness. Nepal in South Asia rather than Afghanistan in Central Asia. Islam is not a factor but some vague sort of Eastern spiritualism is in the wind. Seemingly wrecked by its defeat at Batman's hands at the end of the first film, it is a factor in the second film only by virtue of having helped create the context for the Joker to flourish. Yet he, too, wants to destroy Gotham. By manipulating it into destroying itself. (The films tell us nothing of the Joker's background, as he turns its mystery into a running gag. ""Wanna know how I got these scars?"" Which does not rule out a League role in his creation.)Bruce Wayne is one of the most famous of fictional super-rich guys. But Wayne sure doesn't seem to like his class all that much. In The Dark Knight Rises, he excoriates a big society do he attends as he ends his tenure as a recluse and dashes out again investigating, saying that the money raised for charity is really just to fund self-aggrandizement. The people are ""phonies,"" the contributions a tax write-off to fuel partying, the events nothing more than celebrations of the ego rather than sincere efforts to help make a difference. Wayne intrigues for many reasons, not the least of which that he employs his fortune to make a difference. There's no poking around the edges of things, indulging in lightweight philanthropy, or simple indulgence while concentrating on racking up the profits.In fact, Wayne only returned to Gotham, and his life as ""billionaire Bruce Wayne,"" in the first film as a means to an end. He's very single-minded. There's no poking around the edges of things, indulging in lightweight philanthropy, or simple indulgence while concentrating on racking up the profits.Indeed, Wayne never appears in the trilogy as a figure particularly interested in his role as billionaire capitalist. After his seven-year sojourn away from Gotham, depicted in the first film, he returns to begin his fight to change Gotham by taking on its rampant crime and corruption. He creates the public persona of Bruce Wayne in a calculated manner, just as he creates the Batman. The eccentric playboy billionaire is every bit the fictional creation that the caped crusader is. Perhaps more so, because Wayne seems much less interested in it.After all, he relied on family butler/confidante Alfred for the concept of ""Bruce Wayne."" He certainly didn't turn to Alfred to come up with the Batman.Notwithstanding its somewhat corrosive view of the very rich, the trilogy doesn't see see liberalism, noblesse oblige variant or otherwise, as an effective answer, either. Nor does it embrace Occupy-style social revolt, viewing it rather sardonically as something prone to manipulation, as well as another form of self-aggrandizement. Which, given the evaporation of the Occupy movement, may lend it more weight than it deserves. But Nolan understands the power of the idea, if not its brief and shaky manifestation in the real world last year.The Dark Knight Rises concludes a landmark movie trilogy.As for liberalism, the trilogy presents it as a failure, albeit one that was only incompletely tried. Bruce Wayne's father was a sort of New Deal liberal, spending massively on anti-poverty projects and building an extensive cheap public transit system to link the city together before being murdered by a poor man turned to crime.Wayne's opponent for most of the The Dark Knight Rises, before his true enemy is revealed, Bane, manipulates populist sentiment to build his power as a warlord. This is why Bane is able, utilizing Occupy rhetoric, to emerge so successfully as Gotham's war lord with his coup.But he is no liberator, he's a destroyer.While Bane undoubtedly despises the gullibility and greed of his new Gotham followers, though not his dedicated soldiers, he especially despises the capitalists of Gotham. Told during a daring raid that there is no money for him to steal in the stock exchange, he asks his yuppie interlocutor: ""Then why are you here?"" One especially unfortunate tycoon learns all too late that paying Bane and his mercenaries to aid in his bid to take over Wayne Enterprises leads only to disaster, as Bane asks him disdainfully if he really imagined that the money gave him power over Bane shortly before crushing his skull.In addition to engaging, albeit in comic book style, questions of economic crisis and class central to the current American experience, the trilogy engages the changes wrought in the wake of 9/11.The Dark Knight presents its own version of a ""Total Information Awareness"" system. Developed in secret by Bruce Wayne as a means of spying on anyone in Gotham, to the horror of Lucius Fox, it's a thinly veiled metaphorical representation for the surveillance society envisioned by the Bush/Cheney Administration after 9/11.Lucius Fox is appalled to see some of an earlier invention of his used for the purpose of spying on everyone in Gotham, insisting that is too much power to be concentrated in anyone's hands. Wayne, insisting that it must be used to find the Joker, tells him that is why he has left the power in Fox's hands. In the end, with the Joker found and stopped, Wayne allows Fox, who has vowed to resign in protest once the Joker is found, to destroy the system.And there is the cynical deal to preserve a semblance of public idealism and pass convenient new anti-crime legislation.The Joker succeeded in bringing Harvey Dent, Gotham's ""white knight"" district attorney, down to his level, successfully driving him insane and turning him into a ruthless murderer. But Batman and Police Commissioner James Gordon contrive to sweep all that under the rug and place the blame for Dent's actions on Batman.Dent's unblemished reputation is used to pass sweeping anti-crime legislation which, though the third film is vague about this, apparently does away with some criminal defenses previously in use. But the film makes the subversive point that, although the crime rate is substantially lowered, the corruption of Gotham continues and opportunity for all is not increased.The trilogy showcases the danger, and at times the necessity, of elements of the surveillance state. But the films argue that it only can stand on a temporary basis. On any permanent basis, it breeds fascism.Batman Begins rebooted a franchise that had become drenched in camp.As for the public myth, it turns out to be corrosive. Not only for Gordon -- on whom it eats away, helping wreck his family -- but for the city as well. The law that the myth enables makes it possible to crater the crime rate, but the city is nearly as corrupt and inequitable as before. It's certainly bad for Bruce Wayne/Batman as well. Saddened by the loss of childhood sweetheart/crusading prosecutor Rachel Dawes, whom he believes, in another myth, had chosen him over Dent, he becomes a recluse, paying little attention to his business or his life. This is especially so after his one stab at renewed world-changing, a cheap clean energy system from nuclear fusion, becomes untenable. His body significantly damaged from his nocturnal pursuits -- remember, Batman has no superpowers, only the technological edge afforded him by great wealth, and can't afford to lose even one fight -- he is something of an emotional and physical wreck as The Dark Knight Rises begins.And as always, he is a most problematic hero/anti-hero. He's not a solution for society's problems, he's a last resort.Bruce Wayne, after all, is a vigilante, in the checkered tradition of the San Francisco Committee of Vigilance, which emerged amidst the chaos of the California Gold Rush, and many others long before the term ""vigilante"" was used. And Wayne is a vigilante with a difference; he is a masked vigilante. Right up until the conclusion of the trilogy, he is a masked man in all aspects of his life.Rachel Dawes, well-played by Katie Holmes in the first picture and also well-played by Maggie Gyllenhall in the second, tells him at the end of Batman Begins that her fundamental problem with him is ""your mask."" Bruce protests that the Batman mask doesn't represent who he is, but Rachel tells him his real mask is the face she's looking at.""The man I loved, the man who vanished - he never came back at all.""By the final film, he seems all too aware of this. It's part of his despair. He tells Selina Kyle, who clearly intrigues him from the moment he catches her robbing him, that she is more than she appears to be just as he told Rachel that he was more than he appeared to be midway through the first film, when Rachel encountered him in eccentric playboy mode, having just joined his Euromodel playmates in an impromptu hotel restaurant swim.Bruce Wayne's key mentor turns out to be the architect of the destruction of Gotham City (read: New York).Christian Bale, as goes almost without saying, is not merely good in the role, he's definitive. The stepson of Gloria Steinem is excellent as Batman, as Bruce Wayne, and as the man wondering who he really is behind the ""Bruce Wayne"" persona he created as cover.When he catches up with Selina at the society function and tells her she has a lot of cheek looking like a cat burglar since she is one, she has a pointed question for him:""Who are you pretending to be?""""Bruce Wayne, eccentric billionaire.""Anne Hathaway is a revelation in the role of Selina Kyle. Hathaway's casting had struck me as a mistake. A fine actress, she seemed too much the goody two-shoes for a character who is, after all, the sexy sociopath known as Catwoman. (Though she's never called that in the trilogy.)So I was very pleasantly surprised to have gotten her totally wrong. Hathaway shines in every scene. She's like a dangerous Audrey Hepburn: Smart, witty, sexy, convincing in action scenes, a slinky black-clad black belt.She and Bale have terrific chemistry together.Wayne and Kyle are both damaged but vibrant souls. An alliance between the two is natural.""To them, you're just a freak. Like me! They need you right now. But when they don't ... They'll cast you out. Like a leper. See, their morals. Their 'code.' It's a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. They're only as good as the world allows them to be. I'll show ya. When the chips are down, these, uh, these 'civilized' people, they'll eat each other. See, I'm not a monster. I'm just ahead of the curve.""The Joker was right about how readily Gothamites would believe that Batman was just bad news. And he while he was premature about how quickly they would turn inward and on one another, he wasn't that far off, as we see in the third film. But it took the combined efforts of the villain Bane and the ultimate villain, his beloved Talia al Ghul, daughter of Wayne's mentor-turned nemesis Ra's al Ghul, to force the issue.(Incidentally, I never thought that Jack Nicholson could be topped as the Joker, but Heath Ledger delivered a performance for the ages.)The Dark Knight is filled with post-9/11 iconography.The League of Shadows may have had nothing directly to do with creating the Joker, but its efforts and Batman's reaction to those efforts helped create the context for him. Each pushed Gotham further down the path to destruction that each sought.The Joker is an anarchic agent of chaos. As Alfred tells Wayne, who has trouble grasping what the Joker is about: ""Some men just want to watch the world burn.""The Joker is not the ideologist that Ra's, Talia, and Bane are, but his intentions for Gotham/New York are the same.Ra's al Ghul, Arabic for ""Demon's Head,"" lays out the rationale for his agenda late in the game in Batman Begins just before sacking Wayne Manor and leaving Wayne to burn to death.""The League of Shadows has been a check against human corruption for thousands of years,"" he says. ""We sacked Rome. Loaded trade ships with plague rats. Burned London to the ground. Every time a civilization reaches the pinnacle of its decadence, we return to restore the balance.""Bruce Wayne protests: ""Gotham isn't beyond saving. Give me more time. There are good people here.""But Ra's is implacable: ""You are defending a city so corrupt that we have infiltrated every level of its infrastructure. ""When I found you in that jail you were lost. But I believed in you. I took away your fear. And I showed you a path. You were my greatest student. ""No one can save Gotham. When a forest grows too wild, a purging fire is inevitable and natural. Tomorrow, the world will watch in horror as its greatest city destroys itself. The movement back to harmony will be unstoppable this time.""Liam Neeson, who has a spectral return in The Dark Knight Rises, gave a strong boost and wicked twist to the first film in the trilogy, appearing first as Wayne's benevolent and extremely challenging mentor Henri Ducard before being revealed as the real Ra's al Ghul. The film cunningly made use of Neeson's movie reputation as a warm mentor before he switched into a ruthless mode which has since served him well in his late-blooming career turn as an action star.In The Dark Knight, Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals far more than expected. That's just another example of the mostly excellent casting that has helped propel this trilogy.There are no fewer than six actors from Nolan's stunning 2010 film Inception in the trilogy. Michael Caine is heartfelt in all three as the faithful SAS veteran-turned-butler/confidante Alfred Pennyworth. Tom Hardy is an intelligent and powerful Bane in the finale. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a scene-stealer in the finale as a young cop-turned-detective whose given name turns out, at the last, to be Robin. Ken Watanabe, a cunning billionaire in Inception, is suitably mysterioso as the faux Ra's in the first and third films. Oscar-winner Marion Cotillard, aptly named as the femme fatale of the subconscious Mal in Inception, is suitably warm and impressive as the seeming ally in business and world-changing and potential wife who is actually our arch-villain. Cillian Murphy, Inception's sympathetic mark, is the nefarious shrink-turned entertaining psychopath of all three films.Inception, which followed in the footsteps of The Matrix and the Arnold Schwarzenegger classic Total Recall in the mind-frak scifi mystery adventure sweepstakes boasted a team not unlike that of the Impossible Missions Force.But Mission Impossible isn't nearly the impactful influence on Inception, and on The Dark Knight Rises and the trilogy as a whole, that the James Bond series is.Incidentally, you can see some related pieces here in the Bond 50 Archive.Inception and The Dark Knight Trilogy have the globe-spanning scope of Bond, not to mention the panoramic action sequences. Morgan Freeman's great Lucius Fox makes a bantering armorer for secret agent Bale, who lacks only a proper wristwatch. And Gary Oldman, at last Oscar nominated for Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, and Michael Caine combine to approximate M as supportive police commissioner and judgmental family retainer, respectively. The climax of The Dark Knight Rises may involve the millionth ticking-time-bomb-with-a-red-LED-display you've seen, but dang if Bond fan Nolan doesn't make that sequence thrilling. Almost as thrilling as in Goldfinger, when it was new.The opening sequence, of the villains taking the CIA plane in mid-air is very Bondian. All that's missing is the sinuous title sequence and, of course, 007 himself.Bane is a Bond villain. Tom Hardy even sounds rather like a weird mixture of Sean Connery and Ian McKellen strained through a high tech mixmaster. And the true villain of the picture is even more Bondian than Bane.Both of the villains are not unlike those in The World Is Not Enough.In fact, they are very much like them.The big plot twist in The Dark Knight Rises is quite like that of The World Is Not Enough, the last Bond film of the '90s. In that film, the third of the four mostly excellent Pierce Brosnan Bonds, 007 finds a provocative and sophisticated love interest in the form of a very rich and powerful, not to mention lovely, woman. Memorably played by Sophie Marceau, a French actress in the analogue to Marion Cotillard in The Dark Knight Rises, she is Elektra King, the Anglo-Azeri daughter of a British merchant buccaneer who married into a Caucasus family and controlled a vast oil fortune in Western Asia before being murdered in MI6 headquarters and leaving it all to her. Victim of a youthful kidnaping by a powerful anarchist and terrorist named Renard who is incapable of feeling pain due to a bullet left in his head by an MI6 assassin which will ultimately kill him, she turns out to be not victim but puppeteer. While Bond believes until very late in the game that it is Renard's plot to destroy Istanbul with a stolen Russian nuclear weapon, it is actually Elektra's. In addition to yielding her the sheer joy of destroying the ancient metropolis at the very crossroads between Europe and Asia, the action will also render her oil holdings vastly more valuable, and grant her a huge role in world energy politics.Bond's associate Tanner says of the anarchist Renard: ""His only goal is chaos."" Much like that of the Joker. But he is really more like Bane, a willing sacrifice in service of the larger agenda of the woman he hopelessly loves.The downbeat ending to The Dark Knight sets up the rather bleak circumstances in which we find Bruce Wayne, who has abandoned Batman, at the beginning of the third picture.Batman Begins began a trend of very successful reboots, which include Casino Royale, Star Trek, and X-Men: First Class. The Dark Knight took comic book movies into the box office stratosphere. And now The Dark Knight Rises brings down the curtain on what is clearly one of the most impressive movie trilogies.I have several favorite trilogies, from Godfather (1972, 1974, 1990), Terminator (1984, 1991, 2003), Star Wars (1977, 1980, 1983), Star Trek (1982, 1984, 1986), and Indiana Jones (1981, 1984, 1989) to The Lord of the Rings (2001, 2003, 2005).Unlike as many as half of them, The Dark Knight Trilogy has no weak entries. I've watched all three films this month, and each has great strengths and works very well. In fact, I've alternated in recent days about which I like best, with each film laying that claim at various times.Is it the best? At the moment, I might say yes. But more time has to pass to make that assessment. One of the great ironies of the horrific Colorado shootings is that Batman, wait for it, doesn't use guns. Like the Doctor in Doctor Who, Bruce Wayne/Batman abhors guns. He uses his intelligence, his technology, and his strength and martial arts skills to prevail.Bruce Wayne became Batman because his parents were shot to death in front of his horrified young eyes. After nearly killing his parents' murderer with a gun in Batman Begins, only to see him gunned down before his eyes by a mob hit woman posing as a journalist, he journeys through the global underworld learning how to live on the edge and how to fight, ultimately acquiring tremendous martial arts and ninja skills training in the Himalayas.In fact, in The Dark Knight Rises, Wayne tells his instant frenemy Selina Kyle that his rule is hard and fast: ""No guns.""How ironic that a madman would choose the conclusion of this trilogy to gun down happy fans in a movie theater.Batman also bends over backwards to avoid killing his adversaries -- ""We're on to your rules,"" mob boss Maroni tells him in The Dark Knight -- while of course having no compunctions about knocking them into the next time zone.In the end of this most compelling of film trilogies, Batman knocks himself into the next time zone, even as many expected and believed in his death. This was perhaps the most delicious twist in the trilogy, with audience expectations primed for ultra-downbeat disaster. There is a motif, in Dark Knight and Inception, of flipping a personal talisman to determine fate. Harvey Dent has his ""lucky"" two-headed coin; Dom Cobb has his spinning top. But not much is really left to chance, either in those storylines or in the trilogy itself. Dent's lucky coin is ""lucky"" indeed; it's a two-headed affair enabling him to manipulate bets. And Nolan and company certainly didn't leave much to chance in fashioning their films.For in the end, Bruce Wayne/Batman does save the day. He even wins through to a new life. But he doesn't do it as a lone vigilante. He does it as the leader of a team. A very unusual team, a very inspired team, a team that few could assemble. But a team, nonetheless. Alone, he would certainly have failed. Working together, he, and they, succeeded, in spectacular fashion. As does this trilogy.You can check things during the day on my site, New West Notes ... www.newwestnotes.com.William Bradley Huffington Post Archive "

Ron Hubbard, on pace to break art house records for opening weekend ticket revenue.Directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, ""The Master"" stars Philip Seymour Hoffman, Joaquin Phoenix and Amy Adams. It has been widely praised by critics, although some have criticized the movie for not providing viewers with enough answers. Wes Anderson's ""Moonrise Kingdom"" was the previous record-holder for opening weekend art house box office location average. It took in $522,996 in its opening weekend back in May, but only played on four screens, giving it a $43,082 location average.""Resident Evil: Retribution,"" which stars Milla Jovovich as a zombie-fighter, took the overall weekend box office lead, grossing $8.4 million on Friday."
