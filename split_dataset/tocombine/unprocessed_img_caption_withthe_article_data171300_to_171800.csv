Don't be a statistic! Plan ahead and book your next vacation on Black Friday or Cyber Monday -- when travel deals abound.,2012-11-21,"FILE - In this Nov. 25, 2011 file photo, shoppers grab televisions at a store in Knoxville, Tenn., minutes after it opened. Plenty of Americans are having to hold back this year as the lure of flashy ads, tempting bargains and family expectations clashes with the realities of the economy. Experts in consumer behavior say that situation can strain the brain. Scientists say we are to some extent wired for shopping. It seems to tap into circuits that originally spurred our ancestors to go out looking for food, says Brian Knutson, an associate professor of psychology and neuroscience at Stanford University.

1,MONEY,2012 Black Friday Tips: Shoppers Revise Strategies As Stores Open Earlier Than Ever,Catherine New,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/2012-black-friday-tips_us_5b9c8bc2e4b03a1dcc7fa55f,"All of this is designed to do one thing: Help him be among the first people in line at the big-box store in Spencer, Iowa",2012-11-21,"Shoppers wheel their purchases out of a Wal-Mart store in Los Angeles, California, before dawn on Black Friday, November 27, 2009. The annual sales bonanza is held one day after the Thanksgiving holiday. AFP PHOTO / Robyn Beck (Photo credit should read ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c8bc22500003300361ba9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Holden Hanson is not taking any chances for Black Friday: He's going to Walmart on Wednesday to hide video games so other shoppers won't find them. On Thanksgiving itself, Hanson will eat his turkey dinner as a late breakfast.All of this is designed to do one thing: Help him be among the first people in line at the big-box store in Spencer, Iowa, when it opens at 8 p.m. on Thursday. Black Friday’s reputation as the biggest consumer spending day of the year is quickly getting supplanted by Grey Thursday. Retailers are opening earlier than ever this year in what they say is a move to satisfy consumer demand. Walmart and Sears are among the biggest stores opening their doors at 8 p.m. Target is opening at 9 p.m.For extreme deal shoppers, the earlier opening times mean one thing: They must revise their strategies for shopping. Of course, some people forgo the holiday feast altogether. Already, people have been camped out for several days at stores like Best Buy, with the hopes of snagging things like deeply discounted large-screen televisions. On social media sites, like Reddit, users are swapping proven strategiesto get the best deals: Scour ad websites like BFads.net, take friends to divide and conquer, avoid store parking lots, have a small knife to open boxes on the spot and wear hand-warmers while waiting in line.While Hanson plans to show up for the early open, he also thinks it could ruin the exclusive late-night thrill from past years. ""I don’t like 8 p.m. because everyone will be there,"" he griped. The stores' earlier opening times also underscore just how nervous retailers are about sales after last year’s record Black Friday turnout. The National Retail Federation projected that holiday spending will only increase 4.1 percent this year, less than last year’s 5.6 percent rise.But other shoppers, such as David Galloway, a writer who lives in Greenville, S.C., said the earlier opening times this year won't change his shopping strategy. Like years in the past, he will line up on Friday morning at 5 a.m. to do his sale shopping.The deal he wants on Sears' power tools could be available at a more reasonable hour of the day -- like 8 p.m. the night before -- but the early start is actually part of the fun, he said. Instead, his Thanksgiving day will be spent with his family and participating in another great American tradition: watching football.""I think greed is winning out over family but I think [stores] will get enough of a backlash to make some change next year,"" Galloway said.We want to hear from you about your Black Friday experience.

AFP PHOTO / FRED TANNEAU (Photo credit should read FRED TANNEAU/AFP/GettyImages)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c8b532500003300361b7d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Essex Street Market on the Lower East Side of Manhattan is a collision of old and new. Admittedly, the new is more attractive than the old. A bakery gleams across the aisle from a wall of dusty deli cans; a trendy taco joint draws more crowds than that old Santoria religious store that's been there since time forgot. After much prodding, I caved and indulged my 9-year-old son in his latest culinary dream: making stone soup, with ""one of everything."" I handed him a $20 dollar bill and a basket. This is what he bought: one lime; one lemon; one yellow squash; one zucchini; two hothouse tomatoes; a giant head of some kind of green and another more bitter one; two heads of garlic; a big onion; a large, loose carrot; radishes; two red peppers; four jalapenos; and herbs -- basil, oregano, mint, sage, thyme, rosemary and fresh bay leaves. He made a special request to find a container of chicken stock. When we got home, he washed them all in a big bucket and began chopping, which scared me to death. ""Can I have the big kitchen knife that daddy uses?"" Sure, what's the worst thing that could happen? Stitches? A lost finger? I know a couple of great guys with missing fingers. And so he began to wail on the garlic and carrot, and then every other vegetable, which he insisted should reside, once cut, on its own plate before being ceremoniously dumped into the biggest pot we own. He chopped and he stirred, and he popped open each one of the herbs from their plastic snapping cases. He added some salt, and sweated the vegetables in a bit of olive oil before covering them with broth, and then water. Then, he took a baguette and tore it into three parts, and dropped them all in the soup as it began to simmer. He wanted to find a stone in his room to drop in the pot so whoever got it could get some kind of ""prize,"" like an extra scoop of ice cream. No stone turned up, but it was the best fall soup I could remember, and very different than one I would have made. The vegetables were chunkier (more rustic, one could say) and spicier, too. He didn't seed the jalepenos and consider them before tapping in a couple of tablespoons of curry powder. I was quietly grossed out by the wet, floating bread, and then realized it was still firm on the outside and had absorbed the delicious broth on the inside, rounding it out into more of a complete meal. Last night, I went about making a chicken pot pie and it, too, required a lot of ingredients. When Jamie and I were at the store, I was certain I already had enough carrots, but found only one limp one in the crisper. We live above a food co-op, and for the first time ever I looked at J. and asked him if he would go downstairs to buy three large carrots, or about five small ones. I had left him at home for a few minutes while I ran errands, but never had I sent him out on his own. I handed him a $5. He told me he was nervous, ""but I feel empowered."" Realizing the weight of this, I wanted him to experience the beginning, middle and end of this errand and so I marked the front door key with a piece of duct tape so he could let himself in without trouble. He left, and I got to work chopping. Slowly, I filled a pot with the leeks, the celery, the mushrooms. No Jamie. It was after 5 p.m. though, and a lot of people could be shopping after work. He could be stuck in a line with an incompetent cashier; it's run by a steady supply of new volunteers, after all. I didn't want to go downstairs to check on him, because that would disrupt the flow of this impromptu act of independence. But the minutes kept rolling by, and when I heard steps coming up the stairs, I could tell by the weight and sound of them that they weren't his steps. I gave up, put my shoes on slowly and deliberately, trying to weigh each second before dashing down the stairs, through the doors of my building and into the food co-op. What would it mean to interject his first outing with my overprotective concern? I ask the cashier behind the counter if he'd seen a blonde kid. No, he said, looking perplexed.  Suddenly, I was nauseous. I flashed to the story of two other little boys in New York, born 25 years apart from one another, whose mother and father gave them each their first little window of independence. I did not want to go to that dark place, but there I was, and it was like being thrown off of a cliff into a black hole, a giant vacuum sound of ""Then- Where- the- Hell- Is -He?"" echoing in slow motion. Our UPS guy, who has delivered me many packages over the years, stood in front of our door with a cart and a pile of boxes. ""I just gave my kid 5 dollars to go buy carrots downstairs, and he's not there,"" I barely spoke, the words caught somewhere deep inside of my throat. ""How long ago?"" he asked. ""Ten minutes,"" I lied. It had been closer to twenty. ""Is that too young?"" I asked him, like he could the ultimate judge of me, Dad of the Year. ""No, it's not too young,"" he tried to reassure me, as if that was the main question at hand. ""Is that him? In the blue shirt?"" Trodding down the street was Jamie, carrying a yellow grocery bag that knocked around his knees in that clumsy way he has that means he never gets to carry cartons of eggs home. ""Yes, that's him."" I hugged the UPS guy and he didn't hug me back.He's so tall for his age. He could have been a solid 11-year-old carrying that bag; that's what strangers would take him for. When he saw me in front of our building, I could read the frustration with me all over his face as it twisted into a grimace. ""What are you doing out here?"" he hissed. ""It's been a long time, where did you go?""""I went to Key Food like you told me to. Here's your change."" He handed me one penny. Inside of the bag were three large carrots and five small ones, hand selected with their fluffy green tops still attached, probably from the organic rack. ""I didn't tell you to go to Key Food,"" I said. I pointed through the window of the food co-op and into the refrigerated stand of vegetables. ""See the bottom row? See that bag? The carrots?""It took me a minute to re-orient myself to the facts of this last half hour. He'd not heard what I said correctly, but he came home with carrots after walking three long avenue blocks, crossing two busy intersections, and spending exactly what I sent him off with, down to one penny. We went upstairs and I got busy chopping. ""Thanks for not getting mad at me,"" he said. ""I wasn't mad, just really, really worried. But wow, you went all the way to Key Food and back. I'm so proud of you."" Never in a million years would I have sent him on his first solo walk in New York down to Avenue A and back, but as it turned out, he handled it. ""Wow, you had a quite an adventure, didn't you?"" I said in a long breath of relief.""No, Mom. I didn't. You asked me to get carrots, and so I walked to Key Food and bought carrots."""

They are the byproduct of consciousness.",2012-11-21,"Young man enjoying his freedom/rejoicing from his success in the countryside, in a wheat field at dusk (color toned image)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c8ad53c00005b0009cce5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a few readers have reached out to tell me, over the past month or so, I haven't written (directly) about improving performance. Rather, my articles have talked about ""touchy-feely"" sentiments like love, compassion, spirit, and concern for your fellow man. According to the same readers, these sentiments aren't often associated with kicking butt on or off the playing field.So in this article, I want to set the record straight. Let's take a close look at why I would discuss a subject matter that some of you perceive as irrelevant to success.To me, if you want to perform your best, love, compassion, spirit, and concern for others are absolutely essential, and here's why: They don't require deliberate thought. They are the byproduct of consciousness. When a person uncovers a high level of consciousness (the zone, as we might say in sports), awareness expands, insights flow, and answers -- including how to stay ahead of the competition -- become obvious. To the contrary, when a person exists at a low level of consciousness, the intellect (a person's thought system) gets overworked, the perceptual field narrows, and answers become elusive.My purpose, then, in writing about these innate sentiments is this: to turn you inward toward your most natural, fluent, and potent psychological perspective, and not outward (as do virtually all self-help strategies) toward grinding it out, willpower, disrespect, or following someone else's system or techniques -- all of which divorce you from your own intuition, freedom, and imagination.Here's something else you might want to consider: If winning athletes are asked to describe their state of mind during their finest moments, they will almost always use words like, ""No though. I just let go. I wasn't really trying. It came out of nowhere. I felt free and cooperative."" Why then, when you are struggling, would you look to an external mental-performance strategy or motivational tool that requires the exact opposite: thinking, effort, control, routine, or contempt for the opposition? The truth is that low levels of consciousness are momentary. The only reason a person stays there (in a slump) is because he or she is searching outside for the cause and turning to outside methods for the cure.Remember, the system (your mind) is blessed with an inherent propensity to elevate to consciousness on its own. So the answer to enduring peace of mind and consistent achievement is always an understanding of how the system works -- not the application of foreign coping mechanisms.Once again, the reason I often talk about ""touchy-feely"" sentiments is two-fold: to point you in the direction of your most natural, free-flowing, and powerful state of mind, and to point you away from anything that thwarts your instincts by adding thinking, or even doing, to your pursuit of excellence.For more by Garret Kramer, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."

Black Friday began in earnest as Target, Abercrombie & Fitch and other stores opened their doors at midnight.

It might not surprise you then to learn that I am a huge fan of Black Friday! Having said that, in order to be successful on this Friday (or Thursday, or Saturday, or Monday, whenever those deals pop up this year) you must have a plan.Ironically, many Americans overspend on Black Friday. The deals are just too good to resist. TVs are 50 percent off... Fantastic deal, but you don't have to buy seven of them to take full advantage of the deal.Our collective self-restraint and fiscal discipline could use some help. Holiday spending is expected to rise by 4.1 percent this year. That should be good news, and in some ways it is, but keep in mind that there are plenty of Americans who are still in debt from last year's holiday season. Don't perpetuate the irony and drive yourself further into the red on Black Friday. One fall when my kids were young, they decided that they wanted to buy a small television with money they had saved. I insisted that they researched what they wanted, found the best price and calculated the sales tax. When they saw how small the set that they could actually afford turned out to be, they were disappointed. I explained about holiday sales and promised that if they could be patient for another month, I would take them shopping on Black Friday. My kids had seen the crowds line up in years past at seemingly ungodly hours waiting to get into the stores. I think they were shocked that I agreed to go brave the crowds and elements with them, but I knew the deals that waited. I also knew that it would be a fun and memorable experience with my kids.I had my kids make a plan. They had to figure out where we were going and what time we should get there. They were so excited. We braved the mobs and they bought a television nearly twice the size of what they would've gotten if they hadn't waited. Their patience paid off and we had a wonderful time. There are two extremely important things to remember if you want to make your Black Friday shopping experience a success:Plan in advance: Make sure that everyone in the family has a gift-planning calendar. Trust me, this pays off in more ways than you might think. Of course, you know the dates of Chanukah, Christmas, Kwanzaa or any other holiday on which your family exchanges gifts, so these will be easy to mark. Add birthdays, anniversaries, graduations or any other special events that will call for a gift. You may even want to include your children's friends' birthdays too if you're feeling motivated and happen to be that organized. As you get closer to Black Friday, see which dates make sense to shop for. Some people buy all of the gifts they need for the upcoming year in those 24 hours. That's a tall order, but if you're up for it, you can cash in on some big savings.Make a list: In the same way a grocery list helps supermarket shoppers stay on track and not be lured by impulse buys, a list can also help with your holiday shopping. Sticking to a list will keep you from spending more than you intended. Remember; don't leave with seven TVs when you only need one.This Black Friday, consider taking your kids along for part of your shopping expedition. You don't have to leave the Thanksgiving Dinner table and go right to the stores either; there are some great deals still available Friday afternoon. Doing your homework can save you some hard-earned cash as well as prove to be a fun experience for you and your loved ones this Black Friday.This holiday season go forth and shop... responsibly. Listen to that little Neale voice in your head and resist the impulse purchases. When your January bills arrive, you'll be glad you did.Are you braving the crowds and elements this week?

Lee Drexler and James R. Cohen. Available from Quill Driver Books, an imprint of Linden Publishing. Copyright © 2011 by J. Lee Drexler and James R. CohenMany people think they are making a great purchase when they buy oil paintings at reputable, large art galleries in Manhattan on Madison Avenue, Fifty-Seventh Street or in Tribeca. Oil paintings by unknown but decorative modern artists sell easily for over $10,000 each. However, if you try to resell these paintings, you may receive far less money than you paid. Generally, the only way to sell these works is to accept one-half of the sale price or possibly much less than what you paid in the gallery. Sometimes the gallery is willing to sell the painting on a consignment basis and will only take one-third or one-half of the sales price. This is a better arrangement if the work sells. But it could take one to two years before it does; or it may never sell. An art gallery dealer whom I know regularly sells a minor artist's work for $6,000-$8,000. She is the only one that sells his works and thus constitutes the entire market for his artwork. One time I was handling an estate appraisal and I asked her what she would pay for one of his paintings. She answered that the most she would pay was $400. Unfortunately for my client, I could not find anyone else who would pay more. Just to make sure you are doing the math, the proposed sale price to the dealer was between one-fifteenth and one-twentieth of the price my client had paid to buy the piece from the same dealer five years earlier.On the opposite side of the coin is the couple who bought Jasper John's American Flag for $1,000 at Castelli Gallery and sold it twelve years later for $1 million. they were lucky, perhaps astute, but you can't count on this happening to you by any means. The safest way to buy art is at Sotheby's, Christie's, or a top auction house, where if you go to resell, you will usually be able to get close to what you paid. But you must know what you are doing or have an expert guide you.If you have a great eye, the way to make the most money buying art is to buy a relatively unknown artist's work at a gallery before the artist becomes famous and while the prices are still low. If you hit it right, you can have an astronomical increase in value. You have to have a good enough eye, a deep enough pocket, good luck and the patience to succeed.Be sure to click through HuffPost Home's slideshow to see ordinary items in your house that could be worth big bucks.

6,DIVORCE,Benefits Of Being A Divorced Woman,"Micki McWade, Contributor
Contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/benefits-of-being-a-divor_us_5b9c87e4e4b03a1dcc7f8022,There are some less-than-obvious benefits of being a divorced woman.,2012-11-20,Portrait of cute young business woman outdoor with hands spread,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c87e426000033007f83b6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There are some less-than-obvious benefits of being a divorced woman. Those benefits exist, provided a woman chooses to focus her attention on her own life and the well being of her children rather than on the past and what she cannot change. This mental and emotional discipline separates those who thrive after divorce from those who merely get by or drown in bitterness and disappointment. Focus is key. Below, the top six benefits of being a divorced woman:Strength. A divorced woman often grows stronger and more courageous than her married friends. She learns to balance new responsibilities along with the old ones and becomes more aware of her children's needs. She sees that she can solve unfamiliar problems and that she can get it done, even when feeling lower than low. This expanded strength will serve her well in many ways as she moves forward in her life.Compassion. Those who have been through the painful, sorrowful and gut-wrenching experience of divorce develop more empathy and compassion toward others. This pain opens her heart even more to others who are suffering. She becomes more relatable.Creativity. For every problem, there is a solution and divorced women find those solutions. Human beings don't grow as much when things go smoothly. We stretch ourselves and expand our capabilities during times of crises and change. Divorce offers many opportunities to become creative problem-solvers and consequently expand our skills.Self-discipline. Women who have been through divorce learn the value of measuring words. To protect her children, she exercises self-control and uses discretion when they are present. She learns patience when the divorce process doesn't go well or quickly enough. She learns to monitor spending as financial circumstances change. A divorced woman gives her children more love and attention as their lives shift, even when she is tired or stressed to the max.Self-direction. While some doors close, divorce opens others. Divorced women have the opportunity to heal. They reevaluate themselves and their circumstances -- who am I now? Who and what do I want in my life? What's standing in the way and how can I clear those obstacles? Initiative. Divorced women have the opportunity, in small and large ways, to explore possibilities. Even with limited time, she can look at course catalogs, take a class online, try a new sport, read about something that interests her and emulate successful people.When a woman is conscious about how she goes through and recovers from divorce, keeping the focus on herself and on what's best for her children, the possibilities are endless."

Let's not forget the cardboard box for open-ended challenges to transform into a new plaything. What's the role of fun or joy in selecting toys, or should a parent always be thinking of ""education""?Being a fully-developed person requires a good combination of thinking, common sense and experiences. We must also experience a full range of emotions to be fully human. It would not be good to be lopsided to one degree or another. It's better if we can solve problems, make good choices based on character and values, and feel glad and proud about finding solutions.Certainly, children need to solve problems, express their feelings and spend time each day in playful activities. If we are only rational and don't allow ourselves to express feelings, we drastically reduce and diminish the full human experience of joy and discovery. The world of toys provides learning and fun, surprises and skills, emotional growth, experiences of all kinds and much more.Enjoy lots of smart play and plenty of smart toys for a lifetime. Toys, puzzles, and games are good for children -- teens, adults and for seniors. Playtime is, after all, good for all ages and lasts a lifetime. Dr Toy's Tips for Holiday FunTurn off the TV and Turn on playtime for more fun, memorable and more meaningful family time during the holiday season and anytime. When there are no plug-ins, there will be more lively, real play. Everyone tunes into each other and listens. Create fun activities from board games to construction toys, making things and reading books out loud. Make a puppet show and create a puppet theater from a cardboard box. What were your favorite toys as a child? Have you found a special nostalgic toy to share with your child?

The rate of severely late credit card payments dipped nationally in the first three months of the year, even as banks issued more cards to borrowers with less-than-stellar credit, according to an analysis by credit reporting agency TransUnion. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c899a2100003300c52a02.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A young client sat across from my desk, somewhat started. He had just graduated from college and admitted that, during college, he had not been careful with his money. It's a familiar story: As a result of credit card mismanagement, he was climbing out of debt.Now that he had graduated and was looking for a job (to start his adult life PLUS to pay off student loans PLUS to pay off his debt) he learned that employers were pulling credit reports of their employees.This practice is sometimes thought to be an invasion of privacy and although I don't love the idea of it myself, I completely understand why employers do it: • Some do it because they are entrusting people they don't know with expensive assets; they want to know of any red flags that they should be concerned about prior to granting employment. I think this will be especially true if you work with money or other expensive assets.• Others pull credit reports of their employees regularly because those jobs are highly sensitive and the employers want to ensure that their employees aren't in debt and potentially tempted by bribery. • I suspect that some are pulling credit scores to confirm information provided on resumes or to ensure that they're not hiring someone with a habit of moving to a new city every 3 months.So whether you approve of the practice or disapprove, the reality is that employers are pulling credit reports and they might pull yours. Does this mean you won't get a job if you have filed for bankruptcy? Does this mean that you might lose the job you have because you spent more than you should have on that Vegas vacation?Well, each employer will have their own thresholds of what they consider acceptable and unacceptable but here's what I think: I believe they are less concerned with specific credit scores than they are with credit history. Remember, they're not necessarily looking for a specific score like a lender would. Rather, they want to get a third party viewpoint on how stable and consistent and mature you are... and they're using your credit report as a way to get that picture.With that in mind, it becomes even more important to pull your credit regularly and work on improving it, and make sure that the information is accurate!And with the recent graduate who sat in my office, that's exactly what we did. We pulled his credit reports, disputed (and eliminated) some errors, and put together a plan for him to get his debt under control by paying his amounts due on time each month because he was paying them over 30 days late.As of this writing, his credit is in much better shape and he's applying to jobs with confidence, knowing that it will only get better with time.If you are job-hunting now or thinking about looking for a job next year, or if you are in a job that pulls credit reports, do your career a favor and take some time to look at your credit reports right now.Please email me your credit concerns questions@jeannekelly.net"
