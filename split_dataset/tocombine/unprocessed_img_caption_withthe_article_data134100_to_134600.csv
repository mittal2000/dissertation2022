""Kim has a powerful appeal on screen that will lend itself as a strong asset for us to seek innovative partnerships across the modeling and entertainment platform for Kim,"" Ivan Bart, senior VP and managing director of IMG Models, told Variety. She's also got years of experience, having been in the entertainment world since she was just a bit older than Ireland is now. Ireland, of course, has been making waves of her own. After previously landing on the public's radar during her dad Alec Baldwin's voicemail scandal in 2007, the teen's now embraced a career in the fashion world, signing with both IMG Models and Two Management, scoring shoots for the likes of Elle and hanging with industry insiders.

1,TRAVEL,13 Tips to Stay Safe Through Any Travel Emergency,"Norm Schriever, Contributor

Natural disasters, blackouts, theft, or sudden medical issues are unnerving enough, but they can be positively frightening if they occur while on vacation. Far from home, in a foreign country, an emergency can leave us in dire circumstances -- and even be life-threatening. I've lived through my fair share: stung by a deadly jellyfish in a remote British Virgin island, surviving a 7.1 earthquake in Costa Rica that had the whole apartment wobbling and led us to evacuate, and most recently, the whopper of all natural disasters, stranded on Boracay Island in the Philippines as super typhoon Haiyan slammed into us. Honestly, I don't recall ever being so scared in my life, and if the 20-foot sea swells and 200-mph winds had hit us directly like they did Tacloban, half of the island would have been underwater. I'm skeptical we would have made it.I've encountered plenty of man-made dilemmas, as well, being robbed by murderers who'd escaped from prison in Bolivia, a high speed chase with thieves in Venezuela, and again, most recently, left stranded with no access to money when Wells Fargo cancelled my ATM card after the typhoon (for no apparent reason) -- right when I needed it most. Thankfully, I've learned to not only survive but thrive in the face of misfortune. So here are 13 tips to stay safe through any travel emergency:1. Email yourself any vital information. Before you leave home, put any pertinent user names and passwords, pin numbers, social security number, passport information, etc. together on one document. Email it to yourself (on a secure email) that you can log in from anywhere to access.2. Make sure other people have your itinerary. Enlist someone to be your safety net back in your home, and make sure they have copies of your vital information. Provide them with your detailed travel itinerary and have a few planned check-in points where they are expecting an email from you, letting them know all is well. 3. Register with the U.S. embassy. It's a great idea to register with the local United States embassy when you visit another country, called the Smart Travel Enrollment Program, especially in developing countries or out of popular tourist areas. 4. Give your hotel information to your contact back home.  Consider your hotel your ""safe house"" and always let them know if you are going on tours or day trips and with whom. Provide the hotels' phone number, email address, etc. to your contact person back home.5. Put money in the sole of your shoe. This has saved me a few times . Fold up $20 bills and place them under the soles of your running sneakers. If you ever get robbed or stranded, $40 cash will be invaluable.6. Only carry a copy of your passport. Make multiple copies of your passport, but only carry a copy out with you. Leave the original in the hotel safe.7. Split up your debit and credit cards for safety. Don't make the classic tourist mistake and put all of your debit cards, credit cards and identification in one place. Obviously, if that bag or wallet is lost or stolen you'll lose everything. Put one in your toilet bag in your checked luggage, one in your carry on or backpack, and keep one on your person.8. Know where the police station and hospital are.  It doesn't hurt to scope out the local emergency services when you get in town, especially if you have medical conditions. Keep a few extra bottles of water around and your electronics charged.9. Get a prepaid local cell phone. You can usually buy a local cell phone for temporary use and put the number of your hotel and a trusted taxi driver in it, just in case.10. Organize any medications.  Make sure you document any important medical information like blood type, medical conditions and allergies. Keep a copy on your person and one at the hotel. Keep your medications well organized and have a few dosages -- enough for 24 hours -- in your day bag in case of emergency. It also doesn't hurt to travel with a few basic medical supplies like Aspirin, Neosporin, butterfly Band-Aids, etc. 11. Check local and international news. In case of emergency (like a typhoon, protests, coup attempt, etc.) pay attentions to what the locals do, as they've probably dealt with those situations before, but also watch international news and research global Internet stories so your information is well rounded.12. Have an ""Oh, Gosh!"" bag ready. Of course I use much stronger language (but it may be a family vacation you're on). Keep one backpack or day bag stuffed with everything you would need if you had to make a quick exit or evacuate in case of catastrophe.13. Err on the side of caution. The good news is that nothing out of the ordinary happens to 99.999% of vacationers, but in case there is an issue, play it safe. Don't try to be a hero, don't put yourself or your family in danger, and please don't think it's a good time to be macho. It's much better to be overly cautious and get through the situation unscathed, alive and well to go on vacation again."
2,TRAVEL,Abraham's Kitchen,"Stefan Szepesi, Contributor

Each visitor here goes about his own peaceful business. This is our fifth day of exploring the Abraham Path and our first city walk of the journey; we take it slow. The places to see easily outnumber the few miles to walk. In contrast to the last few days, here we are not alone. From sunrise to late after dawn, the Balikligol park is filled with slow wanderers, a mixture mostly of locals and Muslim pilgrims from further away. They stroll past the Fish Lakes, the rose gardens and the half dozen Mosques -- each of them built at a spot of Abraham's story in Islam. The secret birth of Abraham, and his hiding in a cave up to his seventh birthday. The challenge the young Abraham posed to the pagan-worshipping King Nemrut and the king's resolve to kill him. Nemrut's catapulting of Abraham from the cliffs overlooking the Balikligol into an enormous fire below, and the mysterious metamorphosis of the fire into water -- and the firewood, according to legend, into sacred carp. The solidarity of princess Zeliha, Nemrut's daughter, who jumped after Abraham, and whose flames also converted into water saving her from death. Today, the two lakes commemorate Abraham and Zaliha's revolution against Nemrut, against polytheism and in favor of worshipping one single God. Both are overcrowded with large, enormous carp; their sacred status rendering them endless supplies of food by pilgrims. They have no enemies apart from their own appetite. On the Zaliha Lake, visitors can rent a small boat and row about the calm holy waters.  The tourism circus that has overtaken much religious heritage around the world is entirely absent here. We are left alone to our own impressions; free to wander and discover as we please. Pilgrims feed the obese carp, locals drink tea in the neatly kept gardens, and Turkish school groups visit Abraham's Birth Cave. Worshippers quietly enter and leave the Mosques that we visit. We can photograph anything. There are no minders. No special guardians. No tourism police. Some men swipe the plazas with brooms; others plant flowers in patches adjacent to a small madrasa.  On the streets of Urfa I hear Kurdish and Arabic. But all signs are in Turkish. English is virtually absent. Our upscale hotel at the edge of the park caters for all things we had to make do without in our homestays these past four days: private rooms and western-style toilets; a wireless connection and dinner at a table rather than cross-legged on the floor. There's even Efes available, Turkey's prime beer brand. But no English. Instead, we get shy smiles from the staff. The rooms are comfortable and quiet -- apart from a moment around 4 a.m. in the morning when the call for prayer from the four Mosques in the park reverberates against the massive rock on top of which sits Nimrod's Castle. Chanting follows. Abraham is revered even before the first rays of sunlight.   At the edge of the park I come across a campaign collecting donations for Syria. The pictures need no words, though Arabic and Turkish handwriting is all-present over white banners. To western visitors, the refugee crisis is not overtly present in Urfa, a city sixty kilometers north of the border, and relatively far from the camps managed by the Turkish government. Urfa is also a city that traditionally already has a mixed Arab, Kurdish and Turkish population. But we did notice UNHCR tents near the cotton fields in Harran yesterday, probably moved from their original set-up near the border as Syrians seek work on the plains of Harran. The day before that we met a man who had fled from Homs and was now living in the community of Kisas with his family. He had tried to do field work during the recent harvest, a hard fate for someone from a well-educated, middle-class background. The schooling of his children had stalled; they were trying to learn Turkish to proceed with their lives in a new land. These are but a few of the hard stories of this torn up region. We know them from the clinical daily news cycle. But they are harder and more real when you look them in the face.For many these stories have become the single simple face of this region and the chief reason not to visit. They miss out on the other side of the story, the deep cultural and social fabric of the Middle East, the resonance of places such as Urfa, which for millennia has been at the crossroads of civilizations. Barely a hundred yards from the banners on Syria, I pass the Mevlid-I Halil Mosque, the one commemorating Abraham's birth in this city. A sign in the far corner of its courtyard reads Hz. Ibrhim çorba evi, which means ""Prophet Abraham's Soup House."" A peek inside reveals a simple kitchen. This is an aşevi, a soup kitchen, which has been there since time immemorial, known to both hungry pilgrims and local people in need, serving them each morning without asking anything in return. The kitchen is literally a stone's throw from Abraham's Birth Cave. It reminds me of that other soup kitchen in the troubled city of Hebron about one thousand kilometers from here, and a stone's throw from Abraham's Burial Cave. And so the path connects not only through footsteps, but also through the scent, sound and tastes of soup cooked and shared in Urfa and Hebron, and many places in between. The two kitchens symbolize a theme weaved across the stories about Abraham's journey, and about this region more broadly: that of compassion; compassion for travellers, for pilgrims; compassion for the stranger that wanders in.Photography by David Landis, Joris van Winckel, and Stefan Szepesi"
3,TRAVEL,How To Have A Hawaii Vacation Like The Obamas,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hawaii-vacation-obamas_us_5b9db9e4e4b03a1dcc8c1310,"Pearl Harbor is an obvious stop for visitors to Hawaii, but the Punchbowl cemetery is a lesser known gem. Visiting a volcanic",2013-12-19,"HONOLULU, HAWAII - JANUARY 3: U.S. President Barack Obama smiles as he and the First Family walk through the Honolulu Zoo January 3, 2009 in Honolulu, Hawaii. Obama and his family are spending the holidays in his native Hawaii. (Photo by Kent Nishimura-Pool/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9db9e425000036003692f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Friday night, the Obamas will arrive in Hawaii for their sixth, annual Christmas vacation. At this point, they've pretty much perfected their Hawaii itinerary, which means that we lucky observers can simply take note and learn from the experts. Here's how the Obamas vacation in Hawaii: 1. Stay in a $25,000/week house in Kailua on OahuKailua is a posh neighborhood on Oahu's windward side (i.e., the side of the island that enjoys steady breezes). It has gorgeous, white-sand beaches, adorable boutiques, and one of the two Whole Foods on the island. The town has drawn attention to itself lately, however, separate from the Obamas' visit. The town's board recently petitioned the Hawaii State Tourism Authority to stop promoting Kailua as a destination for visitors, complaining that the influx of tourists has prompted rental properties and bed and breakfasts to spring up without proper permits. ""It doesn't feel like a neighborhood when you don't know the people there,"" board member Lisa Marten said. Well, at least everyone knows who Obama is. 2. Get Shave Ice at Island SnowShave Ice is a Hawaii staple; it's more refreshing than ice cream and more delicate than a snow cone. Whereas snow cones are made by dousing artificial flavors on crushed ice, shave ice is finely shaved (like fresh, powdery snow), which allows it to absorb the natural flavors like guava, coconut and pineapple that Hawaii is known for. Obama's reported favorite has three flavors: ""choo-choo cherry,"" ""da kine lemon-lime"" and ""tangy guava-orange."" (""Da kine"" is a versatile Hawaiian pidgin term most closely resembling ""whatchamacallit."") 3. Golf at Marine Base Kaneohe For servicemembers, golfing at Marine Base Kaneohe is just one of the perks of being stationed in Hawaii. The course is stunning and secluded with mountain views for the front nine and ocean vistas for the back nine. It's consistently ranked as one of the best Department of Defense golf courses in the world, and while it is open to the public, getting a tee time can be difficult since priority goes to active and retired servicemembers.Obama golfs here every year not just because it's gorgeous, but also because it's an easy spot for the Secret Service to secure. 4. Pay your respects at Pearl Harbor and/or the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific at Punchbowl Pearl Harbor is an obvious stop for visitors to Hawaii, but the Punchbowl cemetery is a lesser known gem. Visiting a volcanic crater is cool on it's own (this one offers panoramic views of Honolulu), but the Punchbowl crater intertwines Hawaiian and American history. Known as the ""Hill of Sacrifice"" in ancient Hawaii, the crater was used for human sacrifices. That name takes on a different meaning now that the crater is used to honor servicemembers and their sacrifices. President Obama’s maternal grandfather, Stanley Dunham, a World War II veteran, is buried here. Obama lived with his grandparents for a time as a child and is known to stop by the cemetery to lay a flower lei on his grandfather's grave.5. Have dinner at Alan Wong'sWith influences from across the Pacific Rim, including Japan, the Philippines, Korea, and Vietnam, Hawaiian food is a diverse and yummy culinary treat. Alan Wong's restaurants use locally sourced ingredients (a big deal in Hawaii since imported items must travel a minimum of 2,500 miles!) and feature such tantalizing concoctions as the ""New Wave” Opihi Shooter (local limpet, or sea snail, in spicy tomato water with fennel basil ume shiso essences). Obama has eaten here with friends and family, including his half-sister Maya Soetoro-Ng, who lives in Honolulu. Alan Wong has been added to the prestigious American Chef Corps and Obama invited him back to the White House to cook a luau for the Congressional Picnic in 2009. According to Wong, the President's favorite entree is Twice Cooked Soy Braised Short Ribs with Ko Choo Jang sauce, and his favorite dessert is ""The Coconut"": Haupia sorbet in a chocolate, coconut-shaped shell with lilikoi (passion fruit) sauce.6. Stay active with hikes & workoutsPlenty of hikes in Hawaii feature waterfalls, but there are only so many that you are allowed to swim in, which apparently matters to the Obamas. The Maunawili trail, which the family has been known to hike, winds through a lush tropical jungle (thus keeping the Obamas cool and out of the sun!) and ends at a great swimming hole and waterfall. Courageous hikers usually jump from the top of the waterfall, but we doubt the Secret Service lets Obama do this. It can be muddy, especially after it rains, but is otherwise a pretty easy-to-moderate hike.For his more vigorous workouts, the President uses Semper Fit -- the gym at the Marine base, which is only open to military ID holders. “They make the gym spic and span before he comes,"" according to one Marine spouse. ""It’s great for us.”7. Enjoy family timeVacation is a chance for everyone in your family to unplug from the rest of the world and reconnect with each other. As Arianna Huffington -- who will be escaping to Hawaii as well this holiday season -- recently blogged, ""Big Data, unfettered information, the ability to be in constant contact and our growing reliance on technology are all conspiring to create a noisy traffic jam between us and our place of insight and peace. Call it an iParadox: our smartphones are actually blocking our path to wisdom.""Between school, homework and running the country, the Obamas don't get many opportunities to unplug and focus on family time. Their annual Hawaii vacation receives a lot of scrutiny from the public and the press, but it's clearly an important family tradition for them. Michelle Obama once said that, ""You can’t really understand Barack until you understand Hawaii,"" by which she meant the unique local lifestyle and the values held by many in the island community. 8. Bodysurf at Sandy's BeachBelieve it or not, there is more to bodysurfing than just letting the waves pound your body into the shoreline. Watch the President in the below video and you'll notice he cuts lines and maneuvers within and around the waves, rather than slamming into them. Impressive stuff. Sandy's beach is a favorite among locals on Oahu because the waves break close to shore, making it ideal conditions for bodysurfing. It can also be dangerous, however, so novices might want to brush up on their skills before attempting anything like the President's smooth moves. 9. Grab lunch at Zippy's Georgia has Chic-Fil-A, California has In-N-Out Burger, and Hawaii has Zippy's. It's a local obsession, the appeal of which is confusing to outsiders, but the diner chain features such Hawaiian comfort foods as Korean fried chicken and saimin noodles. With locations all over Oahu, it's no wonder Obama grew up loving Zippy's and it's easy to understand why he has to have it when he comes home. Obama has cited his favorite dish as the ""Zip Min,"" a hot soup with saimin noodles, won tons, breaded shrimp, choi sum, fish cake, dried seaweed egg, sweet pork and green onions. Sounds delicious. 10. Enjoy the wildlife at Hanauma Bay Located near Sandy's beach, Hanauma Bay is one of Oahu's most popular snorkeling destinations. As a nature preserve, it's home to over 400 types of fish and an abundance of green sea turtles. Obama and his family have been known to both snorkel there and to visit Sea Life Park, the only place in the U.S. that raises green sea turtles in captivity. Green sea turtles are known as honu in Hawaii and are revered for both their dopey expressions and seemingly lazy lifestyle. It's not uncommon to come across them while paddleboarding or snorkeling, but because of their protected status (they're categorized as endangered species) you can be fined up to $2,000 or jailed for 30 days for touching them. **Bonus points: Get everyone in your entourage to wear aloha shirts!Although the President himself doesn't don the classic threads, his entourage of Secret Service does its best to fit in in Hawaii. According to Honolulu magazine, they sport high-end aloha shirts like Iolani and Tori Richard. They apparently embrace the aloha spirit as well. Despite the many complaints about traffic and security measures when the President is in town, Hawaii locals had nothing but nice things to say about the Secret Service agents themselves.“You'd think they’d get tired of their job, wanding people,"" one Kailua resident told Honolulu magazine. ""They’re so kind about it, and they’re not pushy or arrogant. They are so gracious. I’ve been impressed by running into them.”"
