Her name is Erica, Erica Smegielski,"" Clinton said. ""She lives the truth of what I have been saying every day.""Clinton paused, then revealed why Smegielski’s activism was especially moving. ""Erica’s mother, Dawn, was the principal of Sandy Hook Elementary School,"" Clinton said, drawing some audible gasps from the crowd. ""And she died trying to protect her children, her students.""Hochsprung was one of 26 people killed in the December 2012 shooting at the Newtown, Connecticut, school.Clinton praised Smegielski for translating the grief over the death of her mother into action.""She’d never been in politics before. But she has made it her mission to advocate for common-sense gun safety reform,"" Clinton continued, prompting loud, sustained cheers. ""You know, like the mothers of Eric Garner and Trayvon Martin and so many others, Erica has turned her sorrow into a strategy and her mourning into a movement.""""It isn’t easy, but as Erica said the other day, 'What if everyone who faced tough odds said, It’s hard, so I’m going to walk away? That’s not the type of world I want to live in,'” Clinton concluded. ""Erica, it’s not the type of world we want to live in. And we refuse to live in that.""It was fitting that Clinton chose to make her peroration about gun safety, since it is one issue where she has justly campaigned as the more progressive of the two Democratic candidates. Clinton, with the support of people who have lost family members to mass shootings, has been particularly persistent in her criticism of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders' vote in favor of a law that protects gun makers and sellers from some civil liability."
1,POLITICS,Populism Was The Real Winner On Tuesday Night,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democratic-party-populism-new-york-primary_us_5717af80e4b0c9244a7a7fd5,A silver lining for the Berned.,2016-04-20,Bernie Sanders built on the same populist anger that challenged New York's governor two years earlier.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5717b3381900002e0056bb37.jpeg?cache=fvjXCpOuSy&ops=crop_0_209_3000_1264%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Tuesday was a tough night for Sen. Bernie Sanders' presidential campaign. It was a promising one for the populist movement that has been building steam within the Democratic Party ever since the financial crisis.Hillary Clinton defeated Sanders by nearly 16 points in the New York Democratic primary, reducing his chances of securing the party's nomination to a mathematical moonshot. But a close look at the county-level voting data suggests that economic populism's appeal has increased across the state over the past two years.In 2014, law professor Zephyr Teachout mounted a primary challenge to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D). Her message then was similar to Sanders' today: Economic inequality has festered into a moral crisis, and consolidated corporate power is a threat to democracy. Teachout is now running as a Democrat to fill the open congressional seat in New York's 19th District, and the Sanders campaign has helped raise money for her candidacy.Back in 2014, Teachout won 34.1 percent of the primary vote, carrying 23 of the state's 52 counties.On Tuesday night, Sanders faced a candidate whom the state had previously elected to the Senate twice and who lost only one county to Barack Obama in New York's 2008 primary. But he still expanded Teachout's share to over 42 percent, while taking 39 counties. Take a look at the maps:Some caveats to the comparison: Teachout was challenging an incumbent with years of experience manipulating the levers of power. Sanders has been running a well-financed national campaign for nearly a year, while Teachout put together her bid in just a few months with almost no money. Turnout was high on Tuesday night and very low two years ago.But all of those factors suggest increasing populist momentum. The fact that the Sanders campaign is well-financed by small donations, for instance, indicates that he's been able to marshall energy that Teachout couldn't just two years ago.It's clear from the maps that while Cuomo relied heavily on urban voters, Clinton did so almost entirely. Sanders swept every corner of the state that wasn't the greater New York City, Rochester, Buffalo or Syracuse areas.Around Rochester and Buffalo, Sanders kept it close. While Teachout garnered just 36 percent of the vote in Rochester's Monroe County, Sanders took over 48 percent. Cuomo destroyed Teachout in Buffalo's Erie County, winning 72 percent to 13 percent. But as of this writing, Erie County votes are still being counted, and Clinton is up by just 812 votes out of the 99,586 tallied -- a difference of less than a percentage point.Cities, of course, are where the voters are -- 80 percent of Americans live in urban areas -- which is why Clinton was able to run up a double-digit statewide victory despite losing three-quarters of the state's counties.Part of this divide reflects Clinton's enduring popularity with black voters. Eight years ago, when her primary opponent was Obama, she still won 43 percent of black women in New York. This year, she beat Sanders 3-to-1 with the black vote statewide.New York's black voters are concentrated in cities. Looking back on Teachout's run, it's pretty clear that Cuomo also carried counties with a high concentration of black voters, while Teachout fared better in whiter parts of the state. The Sanders campaign can at least console itself with the fact that in several counties with high black populations -- Bronx, Queens, Erie -- he improved on Teachout's performance.But there's more going on here than a racial divide. The beneficiaries of a corporate-dominated economy don't tend to live in rural areas. They're urban elites. When Sanders and Teachout attack monopolies, big banks and corporate greed, they're assailing a lot of people who live in cities and wealthy suburbs nearby. Wall Street isn't just a metaphor in the New York primary; it's an actual street.Nor is finance the only industry based in New York -- the city is the heart of the multinational corporate borg. ABC, CBS, HBO, Foot Locker, J. Crew, Verizon (which owns The Huffington Post), Pfizer and a host of big law and accounting firms are headquartered in Manhattan, not to mention countless others in the city's suburbs. If an economic populist loses the black vote by a wide margin in a Democratic primary, there aren't enough white urban populists to make up the difference. The math for populists looks a lot better at the general election level. Since 80 percent of Americans live in cities, the vast majority of the 99 percent live there, too. Nationwide, urban voters and voters of color break Democratic, which has enabled Democrats to survive as a party even as the party has steadily shed the populist tenets of Lyndon Johnson's Great Society agenda. The Sanders campaign is demonstrating that Democratic Party voters are heading back toward Johnson's vision, and it's doing so without relying on corporate money -- a prospect that seemed inconceivable only a few years ago. In the future, party leaders won't be able to cite campaign finance demands to justify corporate-friendly policies, and they have a growing bloc of populist voters to grapple with. That's a real achievement.Zach Carter is a co-host of the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here or listen to the latest episode below:"

""In this campaign, we've won in every region of the country. ... But this one's personal. New Yorkers, you've always had my back. And I've always tried to have yours.""Clinton's victory adds to her delegate lead and damages Sanders' claims that he can catch up to her. More importantly, it avoids what would have been an embarrassing loss that would have boosted her rival's momentum. ""The race for the Democratic nomination is in the home stretch and victory is in sight,"" she added Tuesday night. Clinton had long led in the polls, although Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a Brooklyn native, refused to concede the state without a fight. The Clinton team recognized the symbolism of New York and knew what a loss would mean. She was campaigning in the state two weeks ago, even before Wisconsin's voters had gone to the polls.Sanders attracted massive crowds across New York. More than 28,300 people turned out to see him in Brooklyn's Prospect Park on Sunday, according to his campaign, which called it his biggest rally to date. The state has a natural core of supporters for him, with a significant number of strong progressives who turned law professor Zephyr Teachout's 2014 primary challenge to Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) into a real race. But Sanders also stumbled when an interview with the New York Daily News editorial board raised questions about his knowledge of certain policy areas and resulted in some brutal coverage.During last week's debate in Brooklyn, Sanders struggled to explain his vote to grant legal immunity to gun manufacturers, while Clinton continued to dodge calls to release transcripts of speeches she gave to Wall Street firms. Sanders also had to clarify comments that he didn't think Clinton was qualified to be president, presenting the former secretary of state with an opportunity to tout her qualifications. Clinton waged an aggressive campaign to win New York, built upon connections developed during her eight years as the state's junior senator. Backed by the governor, she sought to remind voters why they liked her and elected her then. ""We have an advantage in New York because we had Hillary here as our senator. We know how good she is,"" Cuomo told volunteers and other supporters at a phone-banking event in Buffalo on Monday. ""We know what she brought back to New York and how she helped [the University at Buffalo] and small businesses all across upstate New York and focused on the economy."" At times, it felt more like she was running for senator again, taking pages from the playbook of her 2000 and 2006 races, in which she won over skeptical voters by focusing obsessively on local concerns. Her campaign highlighted upstate initiatives she'd worked on as senator. Downstate, she focused on retail politicking more typical of a mayoral candidate. Over and over, Clinton's campaign reminded New York voters of what she'd done as senator, releasing ads highlighting some of those accomplishments. For her supporters, that message rang true.""I'm here all the way from Jamestown,"" Carol Jones, 55, said at an organizing event in Buffalo on Monday, referring to a city about two hours away. ""She knows where Jamestown is.""Jones said she would support Sanders if he became the Democratic nominee, but she wouldn't be happy about it. ""I'm not going to be an enthusiastic supporter [of Sanders] because I don't believe in unicorns and fairy dust,"" she said. ""It's yadda yadda yadda. ... There's no plan to get what he wants. There's no way it can happen. Not with the government the way it is. Hillary knows how to build those bridges, walk across the aisle and get it done."""

4,POLITICS,Outrage Over New York's Terrible Election Laws Could Actually Do Some Good,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-democratic-primary_us_5717df58e4b024dae4f0e530,Many presidential primary voters experienced a range of problems.,2016-04-20,"Many New York primary voters faced obstacles during Tuesday's vote, including thousands who were dropped from the rolls in the borough of Brooklyn.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5717eb7d22000036002540c2.jpeg?ops=crop_0_567_3948_2046%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Complaining about voting in New York is like kvetching about the G train or about overly aggressive costumed characters in Times Square -- everyone agrees that it’s unnecessarily terrible, but no one has resolved the problem. With more scrutiny than ever being applied to how the state runs its elections after Tuesday's presidential primary, now is a perfect time for New Yorkers to pick up the phone and call their legislators to tell them to improve the state’s election processes. (Solutions were proposed after the 2012 election, and going back as far as 1988, but nothing has changed because of political intransigence.) New York operates a “closed primary,” so each voter must be registered as either a Democrat or Republican to participate. Roughly three million New Yorkers, or about 27 percent of eligible voters in the state, were blocked from casting a ballot Tuesday. It didn't turn out so well.The hurdles for voters are compounded because New York has the nation’s earliest registration deadline for party registration. An eligible voter who was registered as unaffiliated had to switch their registration to a particular party by Oct. 9th -- more than six months ago -- to be able to vote for a presidential hopeful. In early October, Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton led Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) by 22 points in national polls. It’s understandable that an unaffiliated voter wouldn’t know that the state required them to switch their registration to Democratic to participate that far out, especially since no one was predicting that New York’s primary would be as competitive as it was.Sanders repeatedly criticized the nature of the state’s closed primary when it became clear it would affect his chances, since he tends to perform better among self-identified independents and first-time primary voters.“While I congratulate Secretary Clinton, I must say that I am really concerned about the conduct of the voting process in New York state and I hope that process will change in the future,” he told reporters Tuesday night.But New York’s election law problems aren’t limited to its ridiculously early registration deadline. The state is one of only 13 that has no early voting. It has no same-day registration, unlike 14 states and the District of Columbia. (Republicans who have cut early voting and eliminated same-day registration in states like North Carolina and Ohio have pointed to New York to justify their moves, arguing that they’re not the only ones who don’t make voting as easy as possible.) More than 120,000 voters were dropped from the rolls in Brooklyn ahead of the primary. New Yorkers who alleged they were purged from the rolls tried to sue so they could participate in the primary, but a judge blocked their lawsuit.The state Constitution requires Republicans and Democrats be equally represented at all levels of election administration. Common Cause has advocated for nonpartisan election administration to replace the current system, so “familiarity with election procedures would be the primary qualification for staff,” rather than partisan affiliation said Susan Lerner, the executive director of Common Cause New York.The state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said Wednesday his office had opened an investigation into the New York City Board of Elections. While some Sanders fans who were upset with Tuesday's result blamed the Democratic political establishment -- it is, after all, a blue state in general presidential elections with a Democratic governor -- New York’s political dynamics are a bit more complex. Republicans control the upper chamber of the state legislature and haven’t jumped at opportunities to bring a bill to the floor to make voting more accessible. Legislation that would have established two weeks of early voting passed out of the Democratic-controlled state Assembly in 2014 but died in the Senate, for example. “Many of the reforms we advocate for do get passed by the state Assembly and then they stall in the state Senate,” Lerner said. “We have a hard time getting anybody in the Senate to discuss it, much less take it seriously.”Lerner said her office was inundated with calls from eligible voters who were locked out of the primary because of their registration status. She advised those calling to complain to put pressure on their legislators, regardless of the party they are a member of, rather than yell at poll workers or disengage altogether.“The party apparatus here has managed to intertwine its tentacles around the election law, and what is keeping the parties alive is, they believe, their dominance of the election law and they are strangling it, like a tree with a parasitic vine,” she said.State Sen. Tim Kennedy (D), who sponsored legislation to move the party registration deadline closer to the primary, suggested his bill would pass out of the legislature if the GOP leadership in the state Senate gave it a chance. He argued that election reform would boost turnout: New York ranked 46th in turnout for the 2014 elections.“If this particular piece of legislation came to the floor in the Senate it would pass overwhelmingly -- but the Republican leadership has failed to bring this sort of election law reform for a vote,” he said. “Unfortunately, because of the historical political gamesmanship, what we have is an extraordinary, hopeless level of voter apathy in the process.” To ameliorate that distrust in the process, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) has called for automatic registration, so voters are registered when they interact with the Department of Motor Vehicles and other government agencies, as well as for early voting. The New York City Council has advocated for the state legislature to pass a slew of election reforms, as has New York City’s Democratic Comptroller Scott Stringer. None of these reforms will pass without state legislative action. Progressives hope Democrat Todd Kaminsky’s victory in the special election to fill Republican Dean Skelos’ vacated seat Tuesday could foreshadow more wins in November for candidates who want to make voting easier. “There’s definitely a real sense that our voting systems are archaic and there is real grassroots momentum for reforming our voting system and for broader political reform,” said Bill Lipton, the director of the New York Working Families Party. “The Kaminsky victory in Long Island means that the political conditions are changing and that energy could actually make it to Albany and make these changes real.” "

Women are still essentially locked out of the most powerful jobs in the country, according to a study released Tuesday by Strategy&, PricewaterhouseCoopers' consulting business. Female executives landed just 2.8 percent of the new chief executive jobs that opened up last year around the world, according to the analysis of 2,500 global public companies. Put another way, there were 359 open CEO slots last year and women filled just 10. That's the lowest percentage since 2011. Between the U.S. and Canada, only one woman scored a CEO job: Andrea Greenberg, who runs MSG Networks Inc.Close your eyes and picture a CEO. Is that person wearing a suit or a hoodie? Tall? Bald? Fat or thin? Chances are, you're not picturing a lady boss. If you Google ""CEO,"" the search engine almost exclusively returns photos of men. That makes sense. Most CEOs are men. And that's not changing. In fact, things are moving backwards. We haven't had this few new women chief executives in the U.S. and Canada since PwC first did this survey in 2004.There are currently only 20 female chief executives running S&P 500 firms, according to data compiled by Catalyst. And if Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer is ousted -- and there are indications that that may happen -- things might get worse.PwC is still confident, however, that things will one day be better for women. More than one-third of new CEOs will be women by 2040, the consulting firm predicts in its report, citing inevitable social forces. That's 24 years from now -- a quarter of a century -- and men would still have most of the top jobs. "

He is part of a breeding program that the Palm Beach Zoo participates in, along with more than two dozen other North American institutions.The Palm Beach Zoo is asking that the media not identify the tiger responsible for Konwiser's death, saying it could jeopardize the animal's safety.""The Zoo has no interest in assisting, allowing or encouraging blame on one of only 250 Malayan tigers remaining in existence,"" the zoo said in a statement Tuesday. ""The male Malayan tiger involved in the April 15th incident has never been blamed or identified. His future has never been in jeopardy. His age has never been divulged. He has never been involved in any other incident at Palm Beach Zoo,"" the statement says. ""The Zoo has never had any other animal-related human deaths in its 60-year history.""Local media outlets report that there have been at least three animal-related injuries in the zoo's history, two of which involved tigers.In 1990, a monkey reportedly bit a maintenance worker's hand after the worker entered an enclosure without management's approval. In 2008, a tiger bit a keeper's finger to the bone while she was hand-feeding the animal. And in 2011, a tiger scratched a maintenance worker's back after the man fell and landed against the tiger's cage in a restricted area.The Sun-Sentinel, a Florida newspaper, reports that the zoo has received backlash over the way it handled the incident that led to Konwiser's death.When a representative from the zoo called 911 following the tiger attack, the caller was initially vague about what had happened, saying only that paramedics were needed. According to the Sentinel, which obtained a recording of the call, the zoo worker didn't mention tigers until over a minute and a half into the call, despite repeated questions by the police dispatcher.Then, because the tiger had been tranquilized instead of shot, paramedics weren’t immediately able to enter the enclosure to treat Konwiser, the Sentinel reports.The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission and the West Palm Beach Police did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the Palm Beach Zoo referred The Huffington Post to the zoo's online statement."
8,POLITICS,Supreme Court Rules For Congress -- And Victims Of Iran-Sponsored Terrorism,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-iran-terrorism_us_5717dacde4b0c9244a7ab2cc,The ruling means Iran's central bank must pay terror claims.,2016-04-20,The Supreme Court ruled that a law that directed a specific result in favor of victims of Iran-sponsored terrorism does not violate the Constitution.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5717dfe92200002900254099.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- For a moment Wednesday, the three branches of the federal government seemed to line up in perfect harmony -- if only to show their support for victims of Iran-sponsored terrorism.In a case that stood to alter the rules for the separation of powers, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that President Barack Obama and Congress did not violate the Constitution when they passed a law favoring more than 1,000 victims and survivors of the Beirut barracks bombing and other terror plots linked to the Iranian government.The statute, known as the Iran Threat Reduction and Syria Human Rights Act of 2012, was described by the justices as ""unusual."" It essentially directed courts to award billions in assets held by Iran in a U.S. bank to the victims, which years earlier had won court judgments for their pain and suffering.Bank Markazi, Iran's central bank, sued to invalidate the law, complaining that the president and Congress overstepped their constitutional roles in telling courts how to rule ""in connection with specific litigation"" -- that is, the cases the victims originally brought against the Iranian government.In a 6-to-2 decision authored by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court ruled for the victims -- and in the process, for its co-equal branches of government, which it said did not ""transgress constraints"" the Constitution placed on them.""Congress acted comfortably within the political branches’ authority over foreign sovereign immunity and foreign-state assets,"" Ginsburg wrote in the Bank Markazi v. Peterson decision.Ginsburg, looking to history and centuries-old precedents that asserted courts' independence from the political branches, noted there aren't many ""restrictions"" the Constitution places on lawmakers' ability to pass ""retroactive legislation."" Outside of those, almost anything goes.""So yes ... Congress may indeed direct courts to apply newly enacted, outcome-altering legislation in pending civil cases,"" Ginsburg wrote. She added that victims had prevailed handily on the merits of their individual cases before Congress and the president enacted the law.The law, Ginsburg explained, merely ""serves to facilitate their ability to collect amounts due to them from assets of the judgment debtor"" -- Iran's central bank. She wrote that the law was a ""necessary and proper"" exercise of the political branches' power over foreign affairs.Chief Justice John Roberts, who during oral arguments appeared poised to play a pivotal role in the case, was outnumbered and relegated to a minority with only Justice Sonia Sotomayor.Sounding more or less resigned, Roberts appeared concerned the ruling would give Congress a kind of absolute power over the federal court system.""Hereafter, with this Court’s seal of approval, Congress can unabashedly pick the winners and losers in particular pending cases,"" Roberts wrote. ""Today’s decision will indeed become a blueprint for extensive expansion of the legislative power at the Judiciary’s expense.""Then came this kicker -- a line with a nod to James Madison in ""The Federalist"": The ruling will feed ""Congress’s tendency to extend the sphere of its activity and draw all power into its impetuous vortex,"" Roberts said.There may be some truth to that."

This time, it's about legislation to help Puerto Rico restructure $70 billion in debt ahead of a critical May 1 deadline.In an effort to break the ice, Republican and Democratic leadership aides met Wednesday afternoon with the House Natural Resources Committee and Treasury Department to discuss the bill, according to a senior GOP aide.Puerto Rico -- home to more than 3 million American citizens -- could default on $422 million of debt in 11 days if Congress fails to act before leaving for recess at the end of the month. The island already defaulted on a portion of its debt in January and other smaller loans last year, but the looming May 1 payment, and another $780 million in general obligation bonds that comes due on July 1, is cause for major concern.Puerto Rico’s debt crisis has been years in the making, and analysts warn it has the potential to disrupt municipal bond markets, leaving pensions and retirement funds exposed. Should the island default, the situation could become uglier and launch a number of lawsuits between bondholders and Puerto Rican utilities. And as the financial crisis in Puerto Rico has worsened, citizens have left for the U.S. mainland in numbers not seen in 50 years -- 84,000 moved in 2014 alone, a 38 percent increase from 2010.Congressional leaders originally agreed to act on legislation by March 31. But that didn’t happen. Late last month, the House Natural Resources Committee, led by Chairman Rob Bishop (R-Utah), introduced a bill that would establish a control board to help Puerto Rico handle its finances, and, if deemed necessary, grant some restructuring powers to the commonwealth. The initial reaction between party leaders and the White House was positive, with all sides issuing statements expressing small qualms with the legislation, but maintaining cautious optimism and an eagerness to work together. Then reality sunk in. Last week, the GOP-run Natural Resources Committee cancelled a markup on the bill -- it hasn't move since.Both sides point at the other as the reason the legislation hasn’t gone anywhere. Democrats say this is yet another example of conservatives controlling -- and derailing -- the GOP agenda. Republicans say they delayed the bill to give Democrats and the Obama administration more time to sort out specific language.“When I called off the vote, the bill would have passed with our side alone,” Bishop told HuffPost on Tuesday. “I wasn’t going to make my people vote for it if the Democrats weren’t ready to vote for it at the same time.”Asked what is the biggest issue blocking consideration now, Bishop told HuffPost that at this point, it’s just about letting members “feel comfortable with it” and letting them see what’s actually in the bill. (Republicans insist the legislation is not a bailout.) Bishop said he also needs time to combat some of the contentions outside lobbying interests have raised in opposition to the legislation.Past that, Bishop said, negotiators are working on small issues -- things like the composition of a debt restructuring board and the majority needed for board actions.“I think the basic outline of what we’re trying to do is going to remain intact,” Bishop said. “Maybe a tweak here and there.”But conservatives don’t see it that way.Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), a leader of the House Freedom Caucus and a conservative who was actually born in Puerto Rico, told HuffPost on Tuesday that tweaks weren’t going to win over conservatives.“Small changes won’t get us where we need to be,” Labrador said. He added that while conservatives want a limited number of changes, those changes are significant.What those changes are exactly, Labrador won't say. Asked if he won't publicly name the issues because they are less ideological changes and more adjustments that big banks and investors want, Labrador said, “I don’t get goaded into talking about stuff.”Labrador did say that Republicans should be shooting for at least 150 of the 246-member conference. “It’s got to be Hastert-plus,” Labrador said, referring to the informal Republican rule named after former Speaker Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) that states bills shouldn’t pass without a majority of the majority. (“I’m not that sure we should use Hastert anymore,” Labrador said of the name of the rule.)While conservatives want a few major changes, Democrats want vastly different ones before they sign off. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has expressed concern over the amount of control the oversight board will have over Puerto Rico’s ability to restructure, giving creditors a vote in those restructuring decisions, and whether the bill will raise the minimum wage on the island.But one House Democratic leadership aide told HuffPost that Republicans are less concerned with the Democratic changes than with working out issues on their side -- and with the creditors who hold a large chunk of the island’s debt in municipal bonds. “They aren’t really talking to us at the moment,” the aide said.Another Democratic aide backed that up, saying they hadn't heard anything from Republicans since the committee adjourned last week.“This is like a summer camp, where there’s a food fight on one side and they're more concerned about the food fight than the fire raging outside the camp,” said Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.), chair of the House Democratic Caucus.Rifts in the Republican ranks are an ongoing issue for the party. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) entered his new post after conservatives in the caucus chased then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) out the door for not taking harder positions against the administration.House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said on Tuesday that he believed Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) were working in good faith on the Puerto Rico legislation. But he warned that this may not be a leadership issue.“They confront the same problem that John Boehner confronted,” Hoyer said, adding that a “very significant” number of Republican members won’t listen to their leaders.Hoyer continued that he feared this latest Puerto Rican obstructionism was part of a pattern from Republicans, who blocked legislation on Hurricane Sandy relief, the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, and raising the minimum wage.“I have grave concern about any attempt of Speaker Ryan to try to negotiate the nuts and bolts of this bill solely within his own caucus,” said Rep. Joe Crowley of New York, the vice chairman of the Democratic Caucus.A vote for the Puerto Rican debt restructuring is expected to be bipartisan. Bishop told HuffPost he still thinks the final product will get a majority of both Democrats and Republicans.“I think at the end of the day, most of the Freedom Caucus will be along with it as well,” Bishop said of the conservative House group. He added that he expects some to vote no, but that he has been in communication with the HFC and “they haven’t said, ‘Hell no.’”As for how fast the House and Senate can move the legislation, and whether they can beat the May 1 deadline, Bishop was optimistic.“Part of the oath of office you take when you become a senator is to be incompetent,” Bishop said. “But even they recognize that this thing gets worse the longer you wait.”UPDATE: 4:20 p.m. -- After meeting with Ryan Wednesday afternoon, members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus said little had changed. Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) told HuffPost the discussion is ongoing, with ""no resolution"" to Democrats' concerns with the bill in sight. "

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5717d97b1900002d0056bb9f.jpeg?ops=crop_0_190_4765_2420%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON --  Senate Democrats are making a renewed push to address the dangers of lead water pipes across the country after their effort to send help to the city of Flint, Michigan, stalled.In the coming months, Democrats, led by Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.), plan to offer legislation that would inject billions into the nation’s crumbling water infrastructure through a piecemeal legislative strategy, using every avenue they think will work.“We’re going to take every opportunity we can to advance this bill,” Cardin told reporters, pointing to a Water Resources Development Act reauthorization senators are currently considering, the separate appropriations process, and even tax legislation if one comes forward as possible vehicles.A summary of the $70 billion package says it would include grants for public water systems to replace lead pipes, a mandatory requirement that states report elevated blood levels in children, and more aggressive testing and reporting of water lead levels.“I think it’s time we turn on the federal spigot, and begin to wash ourselves of inaction,” Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) said.Lawmakers first moved in January, in the aftermath of the water crisis in Flint. The city's 100,000 residents spent 18 months being told to drink brown water until warnings about its lead content were proven true when research showed in September that Flint children had suffered higher levels of lead in their blood.The water had high lead content because the city failed to add chemicals to prevent the water from leaching the heavy metal out of the city's lead pipes. But Flint's not the only city where water mains connect to homes and apartments via lead service lines, which the American Water Works Association says are found in roughly 30 percent of public water systems. The current national strategy isn't to replace the pipes, but rather to just keep an eye on how much lead gets into the water and mitigate -- but not eliminate -- the inherent risk of using lead pipes through anti-corrosive water treatment. The measures, unveiled Wednesday, represent a slight pivot away from an earlier Senate proposal designed specifically for Flint, and toward a broader approach previously outlined by Cardin. Though the Flint measure had bipartisan support, it couldn't get past a hold placed by Republican Sen. Mike Lee (Utah), who objected to the idea of a federal response to the local water crisis. More immediate aid for Flint isn’t being thrown by the wayside just yet. Michigan Democrats Sens. Debbie Stabenow and Gary Peters said they will continue to push the measure on any must-pass bill they think they can get it on. “[We] are all committed to make sure that we get help for the city of Flint as fast as possible and are looking for another vehicle to do that,” Peters said.Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, pitched the Water Resources Development Act as a way for both the package introduced on Wednesday and the more immediate Flint aid being shopped around by the Michigan senators to get passed. “We have the Water Resources Development Act, and it would seem to me to be nonsensical to look away from the whole issue of lead poisoning, whether it’s in Flint or any other place,” Boxer said. “If we can get some of this done through WRDA, we’re going to do it.”Even in low doses, lead exposure can cause brain damage and a range of health problems. It's not clear if the new proposal will win over any Republicans. A spokesperson for committee chairman Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) didn't immediately respond to a request for comment."

It set him up for another big night on April 26, when Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, and Maryland will hold primaries.With a campaign staff reboot and a more focused performance, Trump has sought to improve in recent weeks as a candidate. The tone of his victory speech was in keeping with a more measured style the often-brash billionaire has adopted.“We don’t have much of a race anymore based on what I’m seeing on television,” Trump said as television networks projected a large margin of victory for him. “Senator Cruz is just about mathematically eliminated.”Trump, 69, predicted some “amazing weeks” ahead for his campaign.Still, he has a long way to go to seal the nomination and begin trying to heal the wounds in his bitterly divided party. Some fence-mending may happen when he sends campaign advisers to the RNC meeting starting in Hollywood, Florida, on Wednesday.Trump’s haul of most of New York’s 95 delegates moved him closer to the 1,237 needed to win the nomination outright. Anything short of that will lead to a contested convention when Republicans hold their national conclave July 18-21 in Cleveland.“There’s only two issues left for Republicans: Will Trump get 50 percent of the delegates prior to Cleveland, and if not, how close will he be? New York gives him a nice boost, but it will take weeks before we know the answer,” said Ari Fleischer, who was White House press secretary under President George W. Bush.Cruz, a 45-year-old U.S. senator from Texas, came in third in New York and gave his primary night speech in Philadelphia, where he was already focused on running in Pennsylvania. He called on Republicans to unite around his candidacy.Ohio Governor John Kasich, 63, a long-shot candidate, is seeking to use his second-place showing in New York as proof he is emerging as Trump’s central challenger in the states that come up next on the calendar.NO KNOCKOUT PUNCH FOR CLINTONClinton, a former U.S. senator from New York, former secretary of state and former first lady, got nowhere near the knockout punch she needed to finally put Sanders away.But the broad smile on her face as she gave her victory speech spoke volumes about how important New York was to her bid to become the first female U.S. president.“Today you proved once again there’s no place like home,” Clinton said. “This one was personal.”The race for the Democratic nomination, she said, is now in “the home stretch, and victory is in sight.”Clinton, 68, was to campaign in Philadelphia on Wednesday. Sanders flew home to Vermont to take a day off the campaign trail.Clinton’s win made it nearly impossible for Sanders to overtake her commanding lead in delegates needed to win the nomination.Dilawar Syed, a tech entrepreneur who is also the co-founder and vice chairman of the AAPI Victory Fund, a Super PAC focused on mobilizing Asian-American voters, said it looked like Clinton has the nomination.“Clearly Senator Sanders has a lot of supporters and enthusiasm there. He also has raised a lot of good resources,“ Syed said. ""I think the primary will go on for some time.

""The Constitution, however, does not demand mathematical perfection.""Breyer pointed out that Arizona's retooled districts, which reflected a population shift below a 10 percent threshold the court has established for similar cases, weren't the product of ""illegitimate considerations."" But he did recognize that ""partisanship played some role” in the redrawing process -- just not enough to violate the Constitution.""Given the inherent difficulty of measuring and comparing factors that may legitimately account for small deviations from strict mathematical equality, we believe that attacks on deviations under 10% will succeed only rarely, in unusual cases,"" Breyer wrote.At only 11 pages, the Supreme Court's decision appears sparse -- a fact that University of California at Irvine law professor Richard Hasen, a voting rights expert, suggested was an attempt to avoid a bitter split along ideological lines in an area where the justices have ""some great disagreements.""""More flexibility for line drawers can be a double edged sword,"" Hasen wrote in a blog post Wednesday."

And there will never be anyone like you again.""",2016-04-20,"Kasich high-fives a boy who joined him on stage during a town hall meeting in Annapolis, Maryland, this week.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5716cdd82200002900253f19.jpeg?ops=crop_34_91_2920_1891%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"SCHENECTADY, N.Y. -- The man who asked the first question of the evening at John Kasich’s town hall meeting here on Monday was wearing sunglasses, and the candidate just couldn’t resist.“I wear my sunglasses at night!” Kasich said, as a staffer handed the man a microphone.The Ohio governor waited for the laughter in the audience to die down.“No, that’s just a song,"" he added. Kasich likes to punctuate campaign events with his characteristic brand of oddball levity. It's a good way to break up his heavy monologues about life and loss, as well as the frequent bouts of wisdom-dispensing that define his interactions with voters. ""You have to find out what your gifts are, and then you have to use them to heal the world,"" he instructed the man moments after poking fun at his sunglasses. If your current perception of the race for the Republican presidential nomination consists solely of the nasty and combustible standoff between Donald Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz, you’ve been missing a weird and wonderful component in the form of Kasich. The sense that his run for the White House amounts to little more than an endearing sideshow is, however, often bolstered by his events. The acoustics inside the Schenectady Armory, for instance, weren’t great. They were terrible, in fact, as a dull echo made it difficult to hear what the candidate was saying. The crowd of a few hundred people who turned out to see Kasich the day before he finished second in the New York GOP primary might have been impressive by the standards of a town hall meeting in New Hampshire last August. But just a day after Sen. Bernie Sanders' campaign said he drew nearly 30,000 people to a rally in Brooklyn, Kasich’s gathering felt less like a rock concert and more like a retreat for likeminded souls, featuring the candidate as motivational speaker and life coach extraordinaire.Kasich’s unique version of everyman shtick typically begins with his own rags-to-riches story of growing up the son of a mailman and the grandson of a coal miner who died of black lung disease. But more than any other candidate remaining in the race, Kasich thrives on the give-and-take with voters. It was only five or six minutes into his abbreviated stump speech in Schenectady that he took the first question from the man who wears his sunglasses at night.“What can you do as president to help inspire the people to live a good life, so they can all be successful?” the man asked.Kasich began his answer to that open-ended question with an even more open-ended question of his own. “Who do you think that depends on?” he asked. “Does that depend on a president?”Then, after a little more back-and-forth, the candidate tied it all in with the feel-good mantra that has been his unlikely ticket to mild success in a GOP race in which the loudest, angriest voices have otherwise prevailed.""I believe that everyone is made special, OK? Everybody,” he said. “I don't know if you believe this or know this, but there's never been anybody like you before. And there will never be anyone like you again. You're made special."" The ""Barney & Friends"" theme song, you may be surprised to hear, did not start playing from the public address speaker next. This is just the way Kasich talks to people on a regular basis. It's a presidential campaign in which the candidate doles out self-improvement advice at least as often as he does policy prescriptions and lays his emotions bare wherever he goes, all the while holding out hope that he can win an unlikely, multi-ballot victory at the Republican National Convention in just three months.To say that pulling off the feat would be the equivalent of hitting an inside straight would be an understatement. But Kasich appears to be drinking in every moment of the experience of running for president. His style of campaigning is an emotional rollercoaster ride of public bear hugs, flashes of temper and — perhaps most prominently — lectures on faith, humanity, the mystery of life, and how to live it. John Weaver, Kasich’s top strategist, calls it “conservative reform with a dose of Dr. Phil.” “It’s certainly evolved that way, and people feel comfortable, for whatever reason, talking to him about their deepest secrets or most significant concerns about their personal lives or the country,” Weaver said. “And he has an incredible ability to connect with people and be empathetic and help nurture people at these events."" While human empathy has become the centerpiece of the long-shot candidate’s message, make no mistake that Kasich is still playing to win. This is a race that has defied predictions at every turn, and as they stare down the prospect of an open convention, Team Kasich sees no reason to give up now.Even as the #NeverTrump movement has tended to coalesce around the idea that Cruz represents the last best chance to keep Trump from winning the GOP nomination, Kasich’s supporters aren’t ready to throw in the towel either.When asked if she could envision herself eventually backing Cruz for the greater good of stopping Trump, Arlyn Shultis, a Kasich backer from nearby Ballston Spa, breathed out an aghast murmur that seemed intended to convey near-horror.“That’s game theory, as opposed to who you think is best,” said her husband, Kenton Shultis. “[The Republican Party] is a private organization, and it can pick candidates however it wants to. And if it wants to succeed, fine, and if it wants to fail, that’s not so smart.”The argument that he is the only Republican remaining in the race who can win in November has become the central aspect of Kasich’s case -- and the one that his campaign is pushing forcefully, as it continues to seek out minimal opportunities to add to his modest delegate total.""The reasons I beat Hillary [Clinton] is because my appeal is broad and not narrow,” Kasich said during a relatively rare deviation from his discourse on topics such as self-worth and purpose at the Schenectady Armory. “My appeal is I can get blue-collar workers, and I can get independents."" Kasich will be in Hollywood, Florida, later this week as the Republican National Committee holds its annual spring meeting. He plans to hobnob there with convention delegates, in addition to making his case more thoroughly during a speech at a private reception for the RNC.His entire senior-level campaign team also plans to convene in south Florida to chew over his strategy, which relies on the far-from-certain assumptions that Trump will fail to win the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the nomination on the first ballot and that Cruz won’t become the immediate de facto choice if the front-runner does fall short.The Kasich campaign’s hopes rest on the premise that a first-round defeat knocks out Trump entirely and then Kasich steadily gains delegates on the second and third ballots in what will become a two-person race against Cruz. And then — most likely on that third or fourth ballot, their thinking goes -- sanity wins the day, and the delegates settle on the one man who has a realistic shot at winning the general election.In the meantime, the name of the game is picking up as many delegates as possible through June.To Trump’s chagrin, Cruz’s campaign has widely been credited for its ability to master the complex delegate selection process in various states. But there are recent signs that the Kasich campaign is holding its own in that regard, though within far more limited parameters. Kasich’s campaign boasts that it has secured the support of a majority of Indiana’s 57 delegates, in the event that the convention goes to a second ballot and they are relieved from their first-ballot obligations to the winner of the state’s primary. His team also believes that Kasich will do reasonably well in adding to his tally in the five Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states that vote next Tuesday.Still, the electability-in-November argument, rather than committed delegates, remains Team Kasich’s strategic lynchpin. “It’s demonstrably proven that John Kasich can win in a landslide and the other two would lose in a landslide, costing us at least one Supreme Court justice and probably the U.S. Senate, and that’s a compelling argument for people whose job is to put together a winning ticket,” Weaver said. “We have our own internal [delegate] count, and it’s significantly larger than what’s publicly discussed, and that’s because we’re picking up people who say that once they get past their legal obligation on the first ballot, they’re with us.”Even granting that assumption, however, Kasich faces long odds. He has won only his home state of Ohio thus far and will be hard-pressed to make the case why a candidate who has failed so often in the primaries and currently holds fewer delegates than Sen. Marco Rubio, who dropped out of the race over a month ago, should rightfully be handed the nomination in Cleveland.To keep his already dim hopes from burning out, the RNC would first have to revoke a rule, passed during the 2012 convention, that stipulates only candidates who have won the majority of delegates in at least eight states or territories can be nominated.And then there is the problem of lack of media attention. It’s a reality that reflects Kasich's dearth of primary season victories and perpetuates the idea that he is not a real contender — a perception that could prove toxic to delegates' thinking on second and third ballots.“Our campaign is not a movement, and we can’t get 20 or 30,000 people to a rally because we’re not famous and we don’t have a self-perpetuating energy clause,” said one senior-level Kasich adviser. “Most of the people who come out [for] those self-help sessions tend to come out because they actually want to hear John Kasich.”None of this seems to concern Kasich much, as he continues to campaign on a shoestring budget and his own terms, with only a small pack of embedded national network reporters documenting his moves and local news coverage often just as lacking.And if, as just about everyone expects, he doesn’t come out on top in the end, Kasich declares that he'll be happy to return to what he often refers to as “the second best job in America” with his head held high.""If we live life bigger than ourselves, and we eventually come to what I think the Lord wants us to do, and if we happen to be gone five minutes from now, well, it's gonna be like, you ran the race,” he said in Schenectady. “And a lot of it isn't how you run the race, it's how you finish the race."" This article was updated to reflect that Kasich finished second in New York's GOP primary."

Hochsprung, one of 26 victims of the massacre, was killed while trying to protect her students.“No more families should have to go through what we have,” Smegielski says. “Hillary Clinton is the only candidate that has what it takes to take on the gun lobby.”Clinton’s campaign website says she would strengthen gun background checks by closing loopholes and end legal immunity for gun makers and sellers whose products are used in violent acts, among other reforms.“No one is fighting harder to reform our gun laws than Hillary,” Smegielski continues, as footage of her hugging Clinton appears on screen. “She reminds me of my mother: she isn’t scared of anything. And that’s how I know she is the person who can actually make a difference.”Clinton had equally warm words for Smegielski in her Tuesday night speech.""You know, like the mothers of Eric Garner and Trayvon Martin and so many others, Erica has turned her sorrow into a strategy and her mourning into a movement,"" Clinton said.The Clinton campaign began airing a 60-second version of the ad Wednesday on network television in the Hartford, Connecticut, market, according to the campaign. A shorter, 30-second version of the ad will also be on network television in the entire state of Rhode Island, as well as the Hartford market. It will also air on cable TV in Fairfield County, Connecticut, a suburban enclave just outside New York City that includes Greenwich.A Clinton campaign aide said the spot was “part of a six-figure ad buy.”Clinton’s sizable win in her adopted home state of New York on Tuesday gives her significant momentum going into her next major face-off with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). Connecticut, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware will all hold their Democratic primaries next Tuesday.Sanders' loss to Clinton in New York has further narrowed his path to the Democratic nomination, increasing the pressure on him to win by big margins in the upcoming contests if he is to have any shot.Gun policy is one area where Clinton has had success portraying herself as more progressive than Sanders. Clinton has been particularly critical of Sanders’ vote for a 2005 law that gave gun manufacturers and dealers broad immunity to civil lawsuits over use of their products. The efforts by family members of the victims of mass shootings to hold Sanders accountable for his vote have added credibility to the critique.Sanders has said he would consider amending the law, but not repeal it, out of concern for its impact on small gun-sellers in Vermont.There is evidence that Clinton’s stance on gun safety may have helped her trounce Sanders in New York. Among the 60 percent of voters who thought Clinton would “better handle gun policy,” 90 percent voted for her over Sanders, according to a CNN exit poll."
