Russia on Thursday launched experimental broadcasts of a new 24-hour English-language TV news channel aimed at polishing its image abroad and presenting foreign audiences with a Russian view of the world. (AP Photo/Sergey Ponomarev )",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c08a1f00002e01247e84.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The posters have been popping up like guerilla art across downtown Washington, D.C. One of them, glued to the plywood walls of a construction site, depicts former Secretary of State Colin Powell's 2003 testimony to the U.N. Security Council in the run-up to the invasion of Iraq. ""This is What Happens when there is No Second Opinion,"" the poster reads. ""Iraq War: No WMDs. 141,802 civilian deaths.""Another poster next to it warns: ""In case they shut us down on TV, Go to RT.com for the Second Opinion."" RT, Russia's international broadcasting arm funded by the Russian government, is not being shut down. Its 24/7 broadcasts are carried on cable systems in the nation's capital and across the U.S. and its website streams live video, along with news articles and blogs. But RT is rapidly transforming itself into an American-style whistle-blower, relentlessly reporting on America's democratic deficiencies and malfeasance, at home and abroad. Forget Russia""At home"" means the United States, not Russia. Founded in 2005 as ""Russia Today,"" the cable and satellite broadcaster soon dropped the ""Russia"" part -- convinced, its editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan once told me, there was little interest abroad in life inside Russia. It re-branded itself, simply and anonymously, as RT. RT anchors occasionally refer to the local time in Moscow or note, for some shows, that they are broadcasting ""live from Moscow"" but, for the most part, RT America presents itself as international news network with an American accent. Many of its anchors and reporters are young, attractive Americans, bantering with guests, and urging viewers to ""Check us out on Facebook."" CNN's former talk show host, Larry King, licenses two of his shows, Larry King Now and Politicking, to RT. During the early days of the Ukraine conflict the network famously lost one American anchor, Liz Wahl, who quit on air, saying: ""I cannot be a part of a network funded by the Russian government that whitewashes the actions of Putin."" In March, another American, Abby Martin, also criticized Russia's military intervention in Ukraine but she stayed on and is now one of RT's stars. Martin, an American journalist, activist and artist who studied at San Diego University, hosts a show called Breaking the Set. It opens with a video clip of Martin, sporting sun glasses, dressed in heels and a short, form-fitting purple dress, seated aboard an RT helicopter flying over Manhattan. As the program begins, she walks briskly across the RT television studio. ""What's going on, guys?"" she asks hiply. The topic today: Ebola. The scariest aspect of the epidemic, she tells her viewers, is not the disease itself but the ""the sheer ignorance profoundly displayed by our educational system in response."" That's ""our,"" as in America's, not Russia's educational system. There's no mention of any steps Russia might be taking to protect itself from the disease. No mention of any assistance Russia might be providing to international efforts to fight or contain Ebola in Africa. Martin's target, it's clear, is the ""establishment"" that rules the U.S., which RT relentlessly attacks on behalf of Americans subjected to the ""establishment's"" rules. As her show's website explains: ""There are too many rules in our society that only prop up the establishment - an establishment that tries its hardest to divide and conquer the people. Breaking the Set is a show that cuts through the pre-written narrative that tries to tell you what to think, and what to care about.""One of RT's bêtes noires is fracking, the controversial method of extracting shale and other forms of gas and oil, which many environmentalists oppose. RT, too, it seems, is concerned about the environment. Its correspondents visit town hall meetings across small-town America and, cameras rolling, listen as citizens living near fracking sites complain about illness and disease caused, they say, by the technique. Russian President Vladimir Putin, too, is worried about fracking's effect on the environment. But there's another reason for Mr. Putin's -- and RT's -- concern: fracking is boosting oil production in the U.S. World oil supplies are growing and prices are dropping, threatening Russia's economy, which is heavily dependent on oil exports. The Russian government's battle against fracking goes beyond media campaigns and presidential statements, however. The Financial Times, citing comments by NATO chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen, recently reported that ""Russian intelligence agencies are covertly funding and working with European environmental groups to campaign against fracking and maintain EU dependence on Russian gas."" America, Home of the Un-FreeRT also is positioning itself as the champion of American democracy, and chronicler of its demise. Citing the U.S. Constitution, for example, Thom Hartmann, host of RT's program, The Big Picture, recently decried a ""corporate takeover of our government and the press."" Not a word about the Kremlin's tight grip on Russia's domestic media.Anchor Oksana Boyko's show proclaims: ""Freedom of speech means little; we have the right to question."" Host of Crosstalk, Peter Lavelle, skewers the ""imperial Pax Americana.""RT foregoes the usual experts who appear on commercial U.S. networks, opting instead for obscure commentators with an axe to grind. Occasionally it interviews celebrities whose views about who runs America conform to RT's narrative. Actor Alec Baldwin, for example, recently lambasted the American government's response to Hurricane Sandy, telling the anchor ""What's wrong in America is the government is no longer in control."" Two-time presidential candidate Ron Paul told RT's anchor that U.S. actions in the Middle East are illegal and ""totally immoral.""Taking a page from Fox News, an RT broadcast claimed America's ""mainstream media's"" reporting on the threat from the Islamic terrorist group ISIS is nothing but ""switch(ing) brand for marketing purposes."" Another RT broadcast charged that U.S. airstrikes against ISIS are, in reality, a means to divert attention from domestic (U.S.) issues. America the UglyThe America that RT depicts has little to love. It's a violent place, where police shoot innocent civilians, where voting means nothing, a land where citizens languish under the merciless control of big corporations, with the government and the press prisoners of a ""corporate takeover.""Of course, some American might actually agree with that analysis and RT's broadcasts hitch a ride on that viewpoint. At times, RT treads dangerous close to tried and true tropes from Soviet anti-capitalism propaganda. Here's how financial reporter Max Keiser's Keiser Report promos itself on RT.com's website: ""Markets! Finance! Scandal! Keiser Report's a no-holds-barred look at the shocking scandals behind the global financial headlines. Max Keiser and co-host Stacy Herbert lift the lid on world economics.""From the beginning, RT has specialized in conspiracy theories. The terrorist attacks of 9/11, it claimed, were likely the work of the U.S. federal government. This October RT broadcast a special report on the Malaysia Airlines passenger plane shot down over Ukraine, ""MH-17: The Untold Story,"" claiming a mysterious second plane may have been the culprit. Three years ago the network devoted major coverage to the ""Occupy Wall Street"" movement and the fixation continues with an October report on British comedian Russell Brand calling for a ""revolution"" within the US.To the BarricadesFueled by a reported 40 percent increase in its budget, RT continues to grow. It broadcasts in English, Spanish and Arabic and has created a video and live stream service called RUPTLY. RT claims to have ""global reach"" of over 700 million people in more than 100 countries, a figure industry analysts call inflated.But RT has the backing not only of the Russian government but of its President who believes that the media -- and RT -- are part of a fierce informational battle.At the opening of RT's Spanish-language broadcasting in Argentina, Putin proclaimed ""The right to information is one of the most important and inalienable human rights.""The ""rapid progress of electronic media,"" he said however, ""has made news reporting enormously important and turned it into a formidable weapon that enables public opinion manipulations.""Certain nations, he claimed, are attempting to ""monopolize the truth and use it in their own interests"" and under these conditions, ""alternative information sources become especially needed.""RT is not trying to ""monopolize the truth."" It is, instead inundating viewers with a tidal wave of ""alternative information."" Creating a distorted, fun-house mirror view of America, it cries crocodile tears for the land of the free which, it hints, never actually existed and is, most certainly, gone forever. It never even has to mention Russia. "

""That's an obvious thing.""On Monday, the U.S. Marshals Service in Scranton, Pennsylvania, said its marshals had done nothing ""inappropriate"" while arresting Frein and said it would provide a fuller account of the arrest later in the day.The hunt for Frein, 31, involved hundreds of officers from state, local and federal agencies, using helicopters, armored vehicles and sniffer dogs. Police said last week that he surrendered without a fight. Two firearms were found in the hangar where he was arrested but Frein was carrying no weapons.Tiffany Frein described her older brother as ""really smart.""""I don't know what to think,"" she said of the crimes he is accused of committing, adding that she had not thought of him as a troubled person. ""We don't really talk much,"" she said when asked how the rest of the family had reacted to the shootings and the manhunt.Frein, who was on the Federal Bureau of Investigation's list of Ten Most Wanted fugitives, is being held without bail and has not spoken to his family yet, his sister said.""We can't talk to him for a week or two, I think,"" she said.Frein, bruised and gaunt, appeared at the Pike County Courthouse last week in the handcuffs used by Corporal Bryon Dickson, 38, whom he is accused of killing on Sept. 12 at the state police barracks in Blooming Grove. Frein also is charged with wounding Trooper Alex Douglass, 31, in the shooting. Raymond Tonkin, Pike County's district attorney, says he will ask that Frein be sentenced to death if convicted.""I think that's a little extreme,"" Frein's sister said. ""If anything he needs help.""(Reporting by Joe McDonald; Editing by Jonathan Allen and Eric Beech)"

The increased media spotlight could affect the government's approach to funding, research, and communication about prevention -- shifts that could potentially impact thousands of lives annually.",2014-11-04,"Professor Adrian Hill, Director leader of the trials for the experimental Ebola vaccine holds a vial of the vaccine in Oxford, England Wednesday Sept. 17, 2014. A former nurse will be the first of 60 healthy volunteers in the U.K. who will receive the vaccine. The vaccine was developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and GlaxoSmithKline and targets the Zaire strain of Ebola, the cause of the ongoing outbreak in West Africa. A trial of the same vaccine has already begun in the U.S. (AP Photo/Steve Parsons/Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e69558e260000f92cb63aa6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After almost two months of screaming newspaper headlines and wall-to-wall cable television coverage about the Ebola outbreak, a calm descended over the media in late October. On Oct. 30, the Washington Post's front page carried the headline, ""New Cases of Ebola Declining, WHO Says."" The next day, the same real estate carried stories about the war in Syria and the CEO of Apple, Inc. Over the same two days, Ebola was nowhere to be found on the front page of the New York Times. It was 23 days after the death of Thomas Eric Duncan, the first and only confirmed Ebola fatality in the United States. Barring another victim arriving on U.S. shores, this slowdown in Ebola stories could be the start of a downward slope often seen in coverage of new, scary viral outbreaks. Coverage of epidemics often tracks well initially with the number of reported cases, with media attention waning in the aftermath of the initial outbreak. But these spikes stand in stark contrast to how the media covers chronic diseases and other health problems with huge human and economic costs to society. Despite far-reaching effects, these stories rarely find the media spotlight.This trend is borne out in a recent analysis undertook by the Wilson Center, which looked at more than a decade of reporting on diseases -- from HIV to tuberculosis and diabetes -- in the Post and the Times. For example, influenza saw Ebola-like spikes in coverage in 2006 and 2009, fueled by outbreaks of ""bird flu"" and ""swine flu."" More generally, HIV/AIDS saw numerous spikes in coverage throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. These initial spikes in media coverage are often followed by a quick descent into what one former AIDS reporter termed the ""inert space of journalistic fatigue."" Source: Lexis-Nexis But many of the costliest diseases facing society barely register above the background noise. These are the sort of issues doctors and health professionals have been warning us about for years. Almost 30 million people in the United States have diabetes, resulting in around $250 billion in medical costs and lost work and wages annually, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A recent report by the Rush University Medical Center indicated that in a single year Alzheimer's was responsible for 636,000 deaths in this country (killing more people than AIDS has done in three decades). Flu kills more than 35,000 Americans per year, but only gets front-page attention when associated with a spreading pandemic. Even Ebola, the focus of so much angst of late, barely registered as a blip in the press despite outbreaks in 1995 (315 deaths), 2000 (425 deaths), and 2003 (143 deaths).Of course, journalists by their very nature tend to focus on events, rather than issues. After all, what is news if not information about recent, important events? But the media is also an important part of our public health system -- not just an outside observer. In her book Selling Science, sociologist Dorothy Nelkin made the point that the public often understands complex issues not through direct experience or past education but through the filter of newspapers, television news, magazines, and websites. Or, as the popular adage goes: The press doesn't tell the public how to think, but what to think about. How the media covers public health matters, especially if media coverage shifts political attention or the allocation of scarce human and financial resources.Earlier this month, Times executive editor Dean Baquet told the Post that, despite not giving the story much play in the early days of the outbreak, the eventual media coverage did force the government to act. ""As it was, I would argue that the press moved more quickly than the government. I think you could make the case that we did influence the government,"" Baquet said.Imagine if some of that media pressure was more equally applied to ""forgotten"" health issues -- problems that are not front-page news because of the prevalence of the disease or how it is viewed by society. The increased media spotlight could affect the government's approach to funding, research, and communication about prevention -- shifts that could potentially impact thousands of lives annually. Coverage of Ebola seems to be slipping. Quarantines are expiring, revised guidelines have been established, and stronger protections are now in place. Assuming we get this outbreak under control, what is likely to happen next? Press coverage will dissipate, the sales of Richard Preston's 1994 book The Hot Zone will drop off (though we may get a movie out of this), and complacency will once again replace vigilance. Then the media will understandably redouble its focus on Ebola during the next outbreak (not to mention plenty of false alarms once flu season rolls around). But better balanced coverage could disrupt this cycle, where outbreaks receive short-term, hyperbolic bursts of coverage and ongoing, chronic issues rarely get covered despite their outsized impacts. This manic rhythm will persist as long as we continue to believe that our public health system is in the hands of doctors and public health officials when in fact the system also includes a powerful partner in the ever-fickle news media."
3,WORLDPOST,UN Warns It Is Running Low On Funds To Help Desperate Syrians This Winter,Sophia Jones,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/syria-winter_n_6101476.html,,2014-11-04,"A Kurdish refugee boy stands during a rainy day at the Rojova Camp, in Suruc, a rural district of Sanliurfa Province, on October 30, 2014. Heavily armed Kurdish peshmerga fighters were on their way by land and by air, joining militias defending the Syrian border town of Kobane, also known as Ain al-Arab, from the Islamic State group after setting off from Iraq. Kobane's Kurdish defenders have been eagerly waiting for the peshmerga since Turkey last week said it would allow them to traverse its territory to enter the town. AFP PHOTO/ BULENT KILIC (Photo credit should read BULENT KILIC/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d989133b00005d30ec982c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ISTANBUL -- With the fourth wartime winter for Syrians just around the corner, the United Nations is warning that its humanitarian effort is dangerously low on funding. Millions of Syrians could go hungry or have to endure the winter months without proper shelter, medical attention and fuel if the U.N. doesn't receive more funding soon, according to U.N. agencies working within Syria and cash-strapped neighboring countries. In its biggest humanitarian appeal to date, the U.N. this year has requested $3.74 billion for the surrounding region, to fund humanitarian operations related to the war. The U.N. said it has received only 52 percent of that annual figure. Of the additional $2.28 billion the U.N. says it needs for humanitarian operations within Syria, it has received only 39 percent.Humanitarian support to Syrians this winter will cost the U.N. $113 million, according to estimates. This aid includes funding for shelters, hospitals, clinics, winter clothing, blankets and other forms of support to help Syrians survive the harsh weather conditions. The U.N.'s World Food Program, which feeds Syrians in Syria, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Turkey and Egypt, says it will be forced to slash some of its food voucher programs in November and December if more funding doesn't come through. Food parcels inside Syria were already cut in size by 40 percent in October due to a funding shortfall. WFP's spokesperson in Amman, Joelle Eid, says the organization wasn't so pressed for cash last year. But now major cuts may have to be made as funding dries up.""This will have horrendous effects on the lives of these families who consider it a lifeline,"" she told WorldPost. ""Children will be forced to drop out of school and work. We would see an increase in child marriage, and many families would go back to Syria even if their area is unsafe.""It costs WFP a staggering $35 million a week to feed 6 million at-risk Syrians. Time is running out, Yacoub El Hillo, the U.N. Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Damascus, told WorldPost over Skype from Damascus. ""I am worried that the suffering of the Syrian people is now eclipsed by the attention given to ISIL,"" he said, referring to the extremist group in Syria and Iraq that calls itself the Islamic State, ""but also by the military action, at the expense of the people who are the key victims.""""I fear this is coming at a moment when winter is fast setting in in the region,"" he said. ""Even if they were able to cope in previous years, I think it's going to be more difficult this time.""While the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution this summer that authorized the distribution of humanitarian aid to Syrians without the regime's consent, the Syrian government and some opposition groups continue to block access to parts of Syria as the humanitarian situation deteriorates. Fuel prices are skyrocketing, and civilians are falling deeper into poverty, often living on a few dollars a day.The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has compiled an up-to-date list detailing how much individual countries have pledged, and which countries have yet to follow through on their promises.""The world can do better,"" El Hillo insisted. ""Donors can be more generous. Not to do so condemns millions of people. It will be a problem not only for Syria but also for Syria's neighbors.""The U.N.'s Director of Humanitarian Operations John Ging has warned that the countries bordering Syria are at their ""breaking point.""While roughly 6.5 million Syrians are displaced within the war-ravaged country, more than 3.2 million have fled across its borders, mostly pouring into Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey. At a major humanitarian conference in Berlin on Oct. 29, Turkey's Deputy Foreign Minister Naci Koru blasted the international community for not taking a larger role in aiding Syria's neighbors, which have borne the brunt of the refugee crisis.On the streets of Turkey's cosmopolitan Istanbul, destitute Syrian families wrapped in blankets beg for spare change. Along the border, many refugees who can't find a place in the already packed refugee camps sleep in bare-roomed apartments and cold bus stations. Meanwhile, Jordan has warned it can no longer accept refugees as it has for three and a half years. And refugees are also being turned away from Lebanon, where Syrians now make up nearly a quarter of the population."

The frightening thing is that one can watch an early '60s flick like Lover Come Back and find almost the same character attributes to females in a movie like The Other Woman, released this past April. Actress, singer and writer Marilyn Monroe was always cast as the dumb blonde even before she made it big. Her cameo in All About Eve"" is essentially a prequel to her blockbuster role as Lorelei Lee in Gentlemen Prefer Blondes; Monroe's characters spend every ounce of energy dumbing themselves down and looking glamorous in search of a rich man to solve all their problems. These roles not only bled past the movies to permanently define Monroe's image and typecast her, but also extended further to uphold twisted cultural norms. Even the starlet's celebrated then-husband Arthur Miller confined Monroe's talent in his 1961 film, The Misfits, her character Roslyn Taber obviously a metaphor for Miller's perception of his wife as the lonely woman who couldn't live without a man. Even today, A-list actresses spend most of their roles playing the damsel in distress or, if more autonomous, as a highly sexualized figure. According to the study ""Gender Bias Without Borders,"" jointly conducted by the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media, the University of Southern California, The Rockefeller Foundation, and UN Women, only 23.3 percent of films evaluated had a female lead or co-lead driving the plot. Furthermore, female characters were over two times likelier than males to adorn sexually revealing attire or be seen partially or fully naked. The study shows woman characters were also severely underrepresented in highly respected workforces, namely business, law, medicine and academia. Scarlett Johansson, who, for ambition, status and appearance, is easily comparable to Marilyn Monroe, epitomizes immoveable film stereotypes. Despite her theatrical accolades, Johansson is pushed into roles that don't allow for the utilization of her full potential. In 2014's ""Lucy,"" the actress plays a woman with a vessel to do virtually anything: the ability to utilize 100 percent of her brain capacity. And what does she do with this gift? She uses her sexual prowess to kill bad guys. While necessary for plot development, Lucy getting revenge is largely insignificant compared to the possibilities of what she could do with these powers, such as finding the cure for cancer or solving the Israel/Palestine conflict. As such, the lackluster storyline could support the misperception that women, regardless of intellect, remain the lesser gender, largely meant as sexual beings. Luckily for us, the solution to the problem of women being underrepresented and highly sexualized in film and TV is both possible and plausible. Women currently account for about seven percent of directors, 19.7 percent of writers, and 22.7 percent of producers, according to the earlier mentioned study. In other words, male persons behind the camera are the majority who produce gender inequality. But, if we encourage more Lena Dunhams and Jenji Kohans to become involved in film, the possibility for more female characters like Girls' Hannah Horvath and OITNB's Piper Chapman could come to life and silence inequality. Or, at the very least, media would benefit from more versatile points of view and creative female minds. So please, more Thelma and Louise and less ""Snooki and JWoww."""

It’s not that they’ve all walked into a bar, though Ansari could probably figure out the punch line to that joke. They’ve all spoken up for feminism this year, part of an unprecedented wave of men actively engaging with what’s usually called “women’s issues,” though violence and discrimination against women are only women’s issues because they’re things done to women -- mostly by men, so maybe they should always have been “men’s issues.”The arrival of the guys signifies a sea change, part of an extraordinary year for feminism, in which the conversation has been transformed, as have some crucial laws, while new voices and constituencies joined in. There have always been men who agreed on the importance of those women’s issues, and some who spoke up, but never in such numbers or with such effect. And we need them. So consider this a watershed year for feminism.Take the speech Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave on that country’s Independence Day. Usually it’s an occasion for boosterism and pride. Instead, he spoke powerfully of India’s horrendous rape problem. “Brothers and sisters, when we hear about the incidents of rape, we hang our heads in shame,” he said in Hindi. “I want to ask every parent that you have a daughter of 10 or 12 years age, you are always on the alert, every now and then you keep on asking where are you going, when would you come back... Parents ask their daughters hundreds of questions, but have any parents ever dared to ask their son as to where he is going, why he is going out, who his friends are? After all, a rapist is also somebody's son. He also has parents.”It was a remarkable thing to say, the result of a new discourse in that country in which many are now starting to blame perpetrators, not victims -- to accept, as campus anti-rape activists here put it, that “rapists cause rape.” That act, in other words, is not caused by any of the everyday activities women have been blamed for when men assault them. That in itself represents a huge shift, especially when the analysis comes from the mouths of men.The Obama administration, too, recently launched a campaign to get bystanders, particularly men, to reach out to protect potential victims of sexual assault under the rubric “It’s On Us.” Easy as it might be to critique that slogan as a tone-deaf gesture, it’s a landmark all the same, part of a larger response in this country to campus rape in particular.And here’s what it all means: the winds of change have reached our largest weathervanes. The highest powers in the country have begun calling on men to take responsibility not only for their own conduct, but for that of the men around them, to be agents of change. When X Doesn’t Equal YFeminism needs men. For one thing, the men who hate and despise women will be changed, if they change, by a culture in which doing horrible things to, or saying horrible things about, women will undermine rather than enhance a man’s standing with other men.There are infinite varieties of men or at least about 3.5 billion different ones living on Earth now, Klansmen and human rights activists, drag queens and duck hunters. For the purposes of feminism, I’d like to delineate three big blurry categories. There are the allies, mentioned above (and below). There are the raging misogynists and haters in word and deed. You can see them in various places online where they thrive (and seem to have remarkable amounts of time on their hands): the Men’s Rights forums, for instance, where they endlessly stoke the flames of their resentment, and the guys on Twitter who barrage almost any outspoken woman with threats and insults. Take the recent threat not just to kill media analyst Anita Sarkeesian for daring to speak up about sexism in video games, but to launch a massacre of women at a speech she was to give at the University of Utah. Sarkeesian’s not the only one in that world to receive death threats. And don’t forget all the gamers who have gone down the rabbit hole of misogynist conspiracy theories under the hashtag #Gamergate.Their position was recently attacked in a striking rant by avid gamer, former football player, outspoken queer rights advocate, and feminist Chris Kluwe. He told his gaming brethren, in one of his more polite passages: “Unfortunately, all you #Gamergaters keep defending this puerile filth, and so the only conclusion to draw is the logical one: That you support those misogynistic cretins in all their mouthbreathing glory. That you support the harassment of women in the video game industry (and in general). That you support the idiotic stereotype of the ‘gamer’ as a basement-dwelling sweatbeast that so many people have worked so hard to try and get rid of.”Someone then tweeted at Kluwe, “Go fuck yourself you stupid cunt. Gamergate is not hating on women.” To which I’d like to append a variation on Lewis’s Law (“all comments on feminism justify feminism”): the plethora of men attacking women and anyone who stands up for women in order to prove that women are not under attack and feminism has no basis in reality are apparently unaware that they’re handily proving the opposite. There are so many rape and death threats these days. In Sarkeesian’s case, the University of Utah declined to take the threat of a massacre at the school seriously (despite the fact that weapons could legally be brought into the lecture hall), because she gets death threats all the time and as a result, she had to cancel her own lecture.So there are the allies and the haters. And then there are a slew of men who may mean well, but enter the conversation about feminism with factually challenged assertions that someone -- usually, in my experience, a woman -- will spend a lot of time trying to rectify. They may be why Elizabeth Sims started a website called The Womansplainer, “for men who have better things to do than educate themselves about feminism.”Other times they try to refocus anything said about women’s woes on men’s woes. Reading men commenting online about campus rape, for example, you’d think that unconscious but malicious young women regularly impaled themselves on innocent bystanders for the purpose of getting them in trouble. Forbes recently ran, and then scrambled to delete, a tirade by a former president of an MIT fraternity titled ""Drunk Female Guests Are the Gravest Threat to Fraternities.” Sometimes, men insist “fairness” means admitting that men suffer from women just as women do from men, or even that they suffer more. You might as well argue that white people suffer from racism exactly as much as black people, or that there are no hierarchies of privilege and degrees of oppression in this world.It’s true, for example, that women do commit domestic violence, but the consequences are drastically dissimilar in both numbers or severity. As I wrote in Men Explain Things to Me, domestic violence is “the number-one cause of injury to American women; of the two million injured annually, more than half a million of those injuries require medical attention while about 145,000 require overnight hospitalizations, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and you don’t want to know about the dentistry needed afterward. Spouses are also the leading cause of death for pregnant women in the U.S.” Pregnant women are not, however, a leading cause of death for spouses of pregnant women. There’s just no equivalency.Not all men get this, but some do (and that might make a nice hashtag). Late this summer, for instance, I saw stand-up comic Aziz Ansari perform in a routine focused on sexual harassment. “Creepy dudes are everywhere,” he said, while describing a woman who had to take refuge in a pet store for an hour to shake off a guy following her. He pointed out that men never have to deal with women whipping out their genitals and masturbating at them in public or harassing them in other similarly grotesque ways. “Women just don’t do that shit!” he exclaimed. (He credits his girlfriend with turning him into a feminist.)The comedians Nato Green, W. Kamau Bell, and Louis C.K. are among the other feminist stand-up comics now speaking out, and Jon Stewart has had some fine feminist moments. It’s great that men are not only in the conversation, but an increasingly witty part of it as well.The uproar over last week’s news that three women say they were brutally assaulted by popular Canadian radio personality Jian Ghomeshi has been an interesting test case for the discourse. People of both genders have taken both sides, though those defending him have often reverted to the recurrent stereotype of the vindictively lying woman. This might, however, have been undermined by the five more women who then came forward to testify to similarly horrific experiences.Ideas are equipment to address and sometimes adjust reality. Seeing a host of new feminist ideas deployed in this case is a sign of how much ground those ideas have gained in the last year or so. During that time, I’ve watched several good men do the work of rethinking much of what they’ve been taught and reach new conclusions. The Obsession About False Rape Accusations: A Handy Pullout SectionOf course, the old ideas are out in force, too. Pretty much every time someone raises the subject of rape in my hearing (or online reading), a man pops up to raise the “issue” of “false rape accusations.” Seriously, it’s almost inevitably the first thing out of some guy’s mouth; men appear obsessed with the subject, and it often becomes a convenient way of changing the focus from widespread female victims to exceedingly rare male victims. As a result, I’ve assembled this handy pullout guide to the subject in the hope that I never have to address it again.Rape is so common in our culture it’s fair to call it an epidemic. After all, what else could you call something that impacts nearly one in five women (and one in 71 men) directly and, as a threat, virtually all women, that is so pervasive it modifies how we live and think and move through the world for most of our lives? Actual instances in which women have untruthfully claimed a rape occurred simply to malign some guy are extremely uncommon. The most reliable studies suggest that about 2% of reported rapes are false, which means that 98% are real. Even that statistic doesn’t mean that 2% are false rape accusations, because saying you were raped if you weren’t isn’t the same thing as claiming a specific person raped you when he didn’t. (No one sifts for the category of false rape accusation per se, by the way.) Still, those stats don’t stop men from bringing the subject up again and again and again. And again.Here’s what such accusations sound like in translation:Her: There’s an epidemic afflicting my people!Him: I'm worried about this incredibly rare disease I heard about (but didn’t research) that could possibly afflict a member of my tribe! Or maybe it sounds like this:Her: Your tribe does horrible things to mine, which is well documented.Him: Your tribe is full of malicious liars. I don't really have evidence of that, but my feelings are more rational than your facts. Keep in mind, by the way, when you consider those figures on rape, that most of them are not reported. Of the rapes that are, most are not prosecuted. Of those that are prosecuted, the great majority fail to achieve convictions. Bringing rape charges is generally not a fun and effective way either to seek revenge or justice, and falsely reporting a crime is itself a crime, something the police do not generally look kindly upon.Hundreds of thousands of rape kits collected by the police in this country were, we now know, never sent to crime labs for testing and a few years back, various cities -- New Orleans, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and St. Louis -- were exposed for not even bothering to file police reports on tens of thousands of rape claims. This should help convince you that the system does not work that well for rape victims. And remember who the police are: an increasingly militarized, mostly male group with high rates of domestic violence and some notable rape charges of their own recently. In other words, they’re not always the most sympathetic people for women -- particularly nonwhite women, sex workers, transgendered women, and other marginalized groups -- to talk to about male sexual misconduct. People also often wonder why colleges adjudicate rape cases themselves rather than report them to the police, particularly since many of them don’t do it well. The reasons are numerous, including the fact that campuses are required under Title IX (a 1972 amendment to the 1964 federal Civil Rights Act) to ensure equal access to education for everyone. Sexual assault undermines that equality under the law. Then there’s the fact that the criminal justice system is broken when it comes to sexual violence and that many rape survivors regard dealing with the legal system as a second round of violation and humiliation. Sometimes charges are dropped simply because the victim can’t endure the process any longer. And now, back to those false rape accusations. In the new hardcover edition of Men Explain Things to Me, I added this footnote: “False accusations of rape are a reality, and a relatively rare one, though the stories of those convicted falsely are terrible. A British study by the Crown Prosecution Service released in 2013 noted that there were 5,651 prosecutions for rape in the period studied, versus only 35 prosecutions for false allegations of rape (or more than 160 rapes for every false allegation, well under 1%). And a 2000 U.S. Department of Justice report cited these estimates for the United States: 322,230 rapes annually, resulting in 55,424 reports to police, 26,271 arrests, and 7,007 convictions -- or slightly more than 2% of rapes counted and 12% of rapes reported resulted in jail sentences.”In other words, reporting a rape is not likely to get someone jailed, and though perhaps 2% of rape charges are false, only slightly more than 2% of all charges result in convictions. (Some estimates go as high as 3%.) In other words, there are an awful lot of unpunished rapists out there. And most rapists, when accused or charged, do not admit to committing rape. Which means we have a host of rapists who are also liars out there, and that maybe the lies that abound are by men who have raped, not women who have not been raped.Of course false-rape allegations have happened. My friend Astra Taylor points out that the most dramatic examples in this country were when white men falsely accused black men of assaulting white women. Which means that if you want to be indignant on the subject, you’ll need to summon up a more complicated picture of how power, blame, and mendacity actually work. There have been incidents -- the infamous Scottsboro Boys gang-rape case of the 1930s, for example -- where white women were also pressured by the authorities to lie in order to incriminate black men. In the Scottsboro case, one of the accusers, 17-year-old Ruby Bates, later recanted and told the truth, despite the threats against her.Then there’s the Central Park jogger case of 1989 in which the police coerced false confessions and the judicial system (including a woman prosecutor) convicted and jailed five innocent African-American and Latino teens. The white victim, who had been beaten nearly to death, had no memory of the incident and was not a witness against them. In 2002, the real assailant confessed and the five were exonerated. Convicting the innocent tends to result from corruption and misconduct in the justice system, not just a lone accuser. Of course, there are exceptions. My point is: they are rare.The false-rape-allegation obsession apparently arises from a number of things, including the delusion that they are common and the enduring slander that women are naturally duplicitous, manipulative, and unreliable. The constant mention of the issue suggests that there’s a weird kind of male confidence that comes from a sense of having more credibility than women. And now that’s changing. Maybe by confidence I mean entitlement. Maybe what these guys are saying is: men are finally going to be held accountable and that frightens them. Maybe it’s good for them to be frightened or at least accountable.What Makes a Planet InhabitableThe situation as it has long existed needs to be described bluntly. Let’s just say that a significant number of men hate women, whether it’s the stranger harassed in the street, the Twitter user threatened into silence online, or the wife who’s beaten. Some men believe they are entitled to humiliate, punish, silence, violate, and even annihilate women. As a consequence, women face a startling amount of everyday violence and an atmosphere of menace, as well as a host of smaller insults and aggressions meant to keep us down. It’s not surprising, then, that the Southern Poverty Law Center classifies some men’s rights groups as hate groups. In this context, consider what we mean by rape culture. It’s hate. Those sports-team and fraternity rapes, the ones that sometimes result in young men swapping phone videos that they never seem to recognize as evidence of felonies, are predicated on the idea that violating the rights, dignity, and body of another human being is a cool thing to do. Such group acts are based on a predatory-monster notion of what masculinity is, one to which many men don’t subscribe but that affects us all. It’s also a problem that men are capable of rectifying in ways women are not.And maybe this is the answer to the guy in Alaska who asked me last June what feminism had in it for him. Remembering that conversation now, I can’t help but think of the slogan that John Lennon and Yoko Ono began to circulate in the Vietnam era: “War is over (if you want it).” It was always assumed to be about the Vietnam War and was revived in the years of George W. Bush’s wars, but it could mean any kind of war or every kind of war, including the ones that live in our own hearts and minds. Hate is an exhausting pursuit with no real victories, and enemies are not a good thing to have. The mind of a rapist must not be a pleasant place to inhabit, and men who can’t hear or recognize the humanity of half the population are missing something. If only the war were over! But, guy in Alaska, it would be nice if you could care about the well-being of others without reference to whether it confers advantages on you, too, especially since you have a lot of the advantages we aspire to, like being able to walk around without worrying about being a target.The other evening, I left a talk on what makes a planet inhabitable -- temperature, atmosphere, distance from a star -- by an astrophysicist I know. I’d thought about asking a young man who was a friend of a friend of mine to accompany me to my car in the very dark park outside the California Academy of Sciences, but the astrophysicist and I fell to talking and walked to the car together without even questioning the necessity of it, and then I drove her to her car.A couple of weeks earlier, I joined Emma Sulkowicz and a group of young women who were carrying a mattress between classes at Columbia University. You may already know that Sulkowicz is an art major who reported being raped and received nothing that resembled justice either from the campus authorities or the New York Police Department. In response, she is bearing witness to her plight with a performance-art piece that consists of carrying a dorm-room mattress with her whenever she’s on campus, wherever she’s going.The media response has been tremendous. A documentary film team was along that day and the middle-aged camerawoman remarked to me that, if campus consent standards had existed when she was young, if the right of women to say no and the obligation of men to respect women’s decisions had been recognized, her life would have been utterly different. I thought about it for a moment and realized: so would mine. So much of my energy between the ages of 12 and 30 was given over just to surviving predatory men. The revelation that humiliation, harm, and maybe even death was liable to be inflicted on me by complete strangers and casual acquaintances because of my gender and that I had to be on watch all the time to avoid such a fate -- well, that’s part of what made me a feminist. I care passionately about the inhabitability of our planet from an environmental perspective, but until it’s fully inhabitable by women who can walk freely down the street without the constant fear of trouble and danger, we will labor under practical and psychological burdens that impair our full powers. Which is why, as someone who thinks climate is the most important thing in the world right now, I’m still writing about feminism and women’s rights. And celebrating the men who have made changing the world slightly more possible or are now part of the great changes underway.Rebecca Solnit, a TomDispatch regular, is the author of 17 books, including an expanded hardcover version of her paperback indie bestseller Men Explain Things to Me and a newly released anthology of her essays about places from Detroit to Kyoto to the Arctic, The Encyclopedia of Trouble and Spaciousness.

It is easy to get explorers excited about doing something they have never done before. Seldom does it matter what the experience consists of, for as long as it is novel, it's practically guaranteed to be exciting, unique, and, in most cases, adrenaline-inducing. It takes a lot more for us to generate the same level of excitement for something we have already done countless times.Kayaking is one of those things for me.Which is not to say that I don't still enjoy it, but when I glance at our recent weXplore itinerary, it just has a hard time competing with things like caving and Hobbiton. It's a charmed life I live and I am well aware of how unappreciative my gut reactions are at times. But it just goes to show how wrong first impressions can be because as I emerged from a bus packed full of smelly teenagers carrying bags of unwashed clothes, I found myself telling everyone who hadn't been on my trip about the kayaking. Even more shockingly, I realized that I was referring to the experience my gut had told me was going to be ""ordinary"" as the highlight of my trip!So what made it so special? After all, I have already mentioned that it wasn't exactly the most hair-raising or adventurous activity that we did during our week long trip around New Zealand. In all honesty, I don't know exactly what did it. But if I had to take a guess, I would say it was the telling of stories that engulfed every rock, cave, and wave in the Bay of Islands.Things are always more special when you know their back stories. I noticed this same sort of phenomenon in Tanzania when we ate at an organic restaurant towards the end of the trip. The chef gathered us around before we ate and went into detail about every flavor, sauce, and spice that had been considered in the making of our meal. He told us the origins of each food and their part in the diet of the native tribes to the region. Every meal up until that point had been equally if not more delicious, but it was by letting us in on the secret that made that meal a highlight.As we were being told the stories that shadowed every feature of the region we felt included. We didn't need to wonder about the tales that blanketed the area because they were described to us in such detail that I could easily retell them to someone who wasn't present.

It's about doing something.",2014-11-03,2014-10-30-transtheoreticalstagesofchangemodel.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-30-transtheoreticalstagesofchangemodel-thumb.jpg,"It's been interesting watching history repeat itself in many Human Resources departments this past year.Back in 2003, when our employee health and performance program − GCC − was first conceived, I remember talking to some HR heads who were lamenting that their efforts to encourage healthy behavior among their employees were going unrewarded. They talked about how, months earlier, they'd allocated budget and provided every employee with a pedometer. As one Human Resources head of a global accounting firm explained, we put a pedometer on each employees' desk with a card explaining that in order to be healthy they needed to move more and wished them luck. It turned out, luck wasn't on their side, because as the HR head went onto explain: ""People put them on and for a few days we saw some already-healthy people kind of getting into it, but within a week or two, they'd all stopped wearing them and they were gathering dust in employees' underwear drawers.""This conversation guided me to the solution that became GCC. Looking back now, I must have heard this story in different forms from different Human Resources managers' lips in every corner of the world over the next few years. From 2002 to 2004, handing out pedometers was a common way for HR departments to sink budget into trying to encourage employees to get more active. The stories always end the same way because when you leave people to their own devices (pun intended) their pedometers always ended up in the same place; generally employees' underwear drawers. By 2004 we'd launched the GCC and pedometers were an important cog in the machine. But they weren't the machine per se.The term 'wearable technology' hadn't been coined in 2003, but pedometers are indeed a wearable technology because they are worn on the waist and they provide the wearer with a piece of data - how many steps they've taken. As many businesses learned the hard way back in 2003-2005, simply handing employees a wearable device that gives them data didn't actually achieve anything in isolation, aside from putting a big dent in budgets.The reason these devices were so critical was because we saw their potential in the context of giving employees a sense of self-awareness. The Transtheoretical Model of Health Behavior Change(1) (pictured below) is a useful point of reference in understanding the role that wearable technology plays in changing employees' behaviors over the long term. Putting a pedometer on an employee is like giving them a personal scoreboard that gives them a display of how active or inactive they have been. It is a tactical element that has the potential to capture the attention of employees regardless of whether they're in the Precontemplation, Contemplation or Determination phases but it is only a tactical element. This shiny, new scoreboard is only effective if there's a game to play. So we created the game which gradually moves all of these employees through to the Action Stage.In our game, employees are given the context of 10,000 steps per day, which is around 5 miles or 8 kilometers, and encouraged to find ways to take 10,000 steps per day, which for many employees is the single most potent and accessible way of leading a healthy life. With a device, a single data point to focus on, some context and the promise of a fun game to get involved in with their colleagues, employees weren't on the road to health yet, but they were standing at the starting line.In order to get employees moving along the path to health and taking action, we've proven that moving - and I mean this literally - is the best first step. In order ensure employees enter the Action Stage and move into and through the Relapse and Maintenance Stages, they need far more than any device can provide. They need to be able to set clear, measurable goals. They need peer support. They require ongoing excitement and motivation and they need a sense of reward.A 2007 experiment conducted by British psychologist Richard Wiseman concluded that 88% of people who make New Year's Resolutions like 'getting healthy' end up failing. Why? Because the absence of the four elements cited above stops them progressing through the Action Stage. Their 'get healthy' goal is not clear or measurable, they're afraid of exercise and see it has a chore or punishment, they are unlikely to see any tangible results for some weeks or months and it is unlikely that they will declare their resolution publicly. Without goal setting, ongoing motivation, reward and peer support it is not surprising that your gymnasium is full in January and empty again in March. It explains why the shiny new wearable devices Santa delivered last year, were conspicuously absent from people's wrists by the time the Easter Bunny hopped into town.The hard truth is that leading a healthy lifestyle isn't about buying something, or wearing something, or consuming something. It's about doing something. For example, giving people the single minded goal of taking 10,000 steps over 100 consecutive days is vital because it helps focus them on one data point. So often people fail to change and achieve the results because they start with too many things at once. Giving an employee one simple thing to focus on, and letting them use their own creativity and insight to figure out, ensures that they do. The Foundation for Chronic Disease Prevention's analysis of GCC 2014 showed that, within 100 days, 85% of participants achieved an average of 10,000 steps per day.When it comes to shepherding employees safely through the Relapse and Maintenance Stages, peer support is also critical. When we originally engineered GCC to have teams of seven, it was because we came up against a problem. We had to ensure that employees received a daily sense of motivation and momentum. A single employees' activity wouldn't move them far across the earth's surface, which would mean that it would take them a week to get from one virtual location to unlocking the next one. We correctly identified that this was potentially a fatal flaw. Imagine reading the same edition of the same newspaper for seven days in a row! The solution was to put employees into teams of seven, which would mean that their cumulative total would move them each day to a new place. This solved a big problem, but as we'd learn, it actually solved a whole bunch of problems that we hadn't yet encountered.When the first GCC rolled out in 2004, I remember visiting some of the people and organizations that participated. They were thrilled at how active everyone was, but it turned out that putting people into teams of seven was a stroke of accidental genius. It galvanized people and got them working towards a common goal. It made sign up easy because each time someone decided they wanted to do the GCC, they had to go and encourage six colleagues to join them. It got people into the program who ordinarily would have run (or gotten in their car and driven) a mile from it. It stopped people stopping, so as soon as people hit a big work deadline or felt tired, instead of dropping out, they felt a sense of responsibility to their team mates and kept going. It created a supportive environment that made entering and staying inside the Maintenance Stage easy, because along with making individual employees healthy, it helped entire workplace cultures become healthy.Exciting, motivating and rewarding employees so that they transition smoothly through the Stages of the Transtheoretical model of behaviour change, can't be left to a device and nor can it be expected that data itself will motivate employees. This is where gamification is such a critical element. The rules for GCC are simple. Form a team of seven, wear a GCC Pulse to count your steps and enter them each day for 100 days. Each time you do, your activity will be converted into miles, added to your team mates' activity and you'll progress along a virtual racecourse around the world. The more active you are, the further you go and the more places you'll visit and discover.The Relapse Stage is the time when most people fail when trying to create a new habit or set of behaviours. This is why employees' interaction with the GCC has to be enriching and create a sense of value and ritual. When the game is engineered and the content is curated and created well, the game becomes fun and addictive, the employee is distracted long enough from the fact that they're now doing something they'd been fearful of - exercising every day - and by the time they notice what is happening, the results are self evident, they're feeling energized, losing weight and looking forward to getting outside each day.Ultimately the reward for doing the things that need to be done (like exercising) and becoming healthy is intrinsic. Being healthy feels really good, it looks good, it is good. At some point as the 100 day mark approaches, employees come to a realization that the game was the thing that got them started and it got them moving and it stopped them stopping at times where they might have ordinarily relapsed. They realize that they couldn't have started the process alone and that the GCC brought a sense of self-awareness, motivation and reward regarding their health and working life.Lately, I have found myself in the same kinds of boardrooms and meeting rooms listening to a facsimile of the frustrated conversations I was hearing a decade ago. ""We bought everyone a device, but it hasn't worked. What should we do?"" Sure the devices cost a lot more and they're more shiny and complicated and regurgitate more numbers this time, but they're disappointing Human Resources departments across the world. History is repeating itself because without the complex and highly creative ecosystem I have described above, which accounts for the 'transtheoretical model of health behavior change', employees are once again being handed a tool which they have no training or motivation to use.For more information about how the GCC helps organisations around the world meet their employee health and performance objectives, visit www.gettheworldmoving.comReferences (1)James O.

In fact, it never ends with the venues and nightclubs that dot the Shore like fortresses against the winter chill.A recent rainy night at The Saint, a smaller Asbury Park brother to the Stone Pony, dripped like a melting jello shot. Blues artists, locals like Pat Guadagno, and distant, Jon Dee Graham from the Texas border country, brought together audience and performers, a few of us reluctant to abandon flip-flops. The Saint is only two decades old, but within it reminds of heartbreaks you think you had gotten over. It's not only about more established performers but also younger acts. My first trip to The Saint was several years earlier to see a young Staten Island band ""Hollywood Hangover"" with a dynamic front man, Walter Pehowich.On to the Summer StageBrookdale Public Radio 90.5 The Night, one of the country's few remaining public-supported and commercial-free stations, keeps Indy music flowing like a warm drink until it moves to its ""Summer Stage"" and the Beach in Belmar. Not all the acts conquered the Stage, but then others who may be overlooked surged upon the audience. This year it was Ben Fuller, Simone Felice, and 7Horse, who rose out of the sand to parlay a gritty, rock & roll that you could feel grinding between your toes. Jersey Shore music is complemented by the surf as humidity bastes New Orleans and Mississippi Delta Blues. The common components are the venues and performers that are in daily combat with obscurity, winning on the day of the show with their audiences but too frequently forgotten the next morning. Record contracts may be the hope but success is defined by an immersed audience, and perhaps a slightly larger fan base after their one-night stand. As with Brookdale Radio, the front man for alternative rock on the Shore, the changing business model offers few options to both the highly talented and the entertainingly persistent. Long Branch's Celtic Cottage frequently lives up to its Irish ambiance but also offers a regular stage for such rising talents as Steve Reilly, accompanying guitarist Steve DeVito, and the ""Rain Band."" (See: Steve Reilly in his original ""Skeleton Trees"")""Tim, Andy, & Joe"" bring guitar cohesion to the far-flung 9th Avenue Pier that has advanced as a sunset refuge overlooking Shark River. The Dublin House, Taste, and Jamian's in Red Bank offer unique venues that bring together demographically some of the most diverse audiences. Monday night is not only a night for football, wings, and beer, but Pat Guadagno at Jamian's and one of the best covers of ""I Am a Patriot"" and the ""Sultans of Swing"" with amazing acoustic guitar. Back in Asbury Park, when not playing for the UN's ""Global Citizen"" platform, Sandy Mack puts together some of the most compelling jam sessions from such diverse venues as upscale McLoone's Supper Club to the ""doggie bar"" defined Wonder Bar, the two venues separated by the width of a street on the still evolving Boardwalk. If this blog sounds as a celebration or roll call of Jersey Shore music, at least in part it is. ""Jersey Strong"" became the slogan after the devastation following Hurricane Sandy, (See: ""Linked by Tragedy of Disaster - Revived by Music"") but neither sympathy nor obstinance could define recovery without a compilation and lineup that is Jersey Song. Jersey summer song is defined by the music festival, particularly the three venues -- Asbury Park, Long Branch, and Point Pleasant -- and dates of the ""Jersey Shore Jazz & Blues Festival."" Refrain & Harmony - ""Exit 0"" ""Exit 0""It usually starts and ends at the southernmost tip of the Jersey Shore and the Garden State Parkway, the ""Exit 0 International Jazz Festival"" in Cape May. (See: ""Where the Road Ends, the Music Begins"") Every May the town lives up to its celebration of the return, before the Cape's population swells from the 3 or 4 thousand full-timers to the hundreds of thousands that feed the mood of summer. Jazz & the Power of SeductionExit 0 International Jazz Festival Executive Producer, Michael Kline, is a former New Orleans resident, jazz radio host, and music-artist agent. He describes jazz, America's original art form, as speaking ""a universal language that has the power to transcend, to rejuvenate, to cleanse, to energize, and to unite."" This Spring all my senses were titillated in the cultural tourism mecca that is Cape May. The Festival was a three-day magical cocktail of world-class musicians, a variety of musical genres, regional epicurean delights, and a vive d'esprit infused by a seductive ocean breeze permeating the atmosphere. I'm not a synesthete and able to see or taste music like my husband, Ambassador Mo Sacirbey, and friend and renowned author, Maureen Seaberg, who together with her husband accompanied us to the Festival and stay at the Victorian Motel. However, all my senses blended to propel Maureen and me onto the stage of ""Kermit Ruffins & the Barbecue Swingers."" It was the headliner's grand finale, ""A Night in New Orleans,"" and Kermit did request a dance card from us -- ""all ladies on stage."" As George Gershwin said: ""Life is a lot like jazz -- it's better when you improvise."" We did, also joining the revelry of a New Orleans second-number.This Round Over, but Last Call Will be in NovemberA concoction of everything seductive: Jazz - Latin, & New Orleans; Blues -- Soul - R&B - Rock- Hip Hop -- Funk - Gospel -- and Reggae is on the bill of fare November 7-9 at the autumn Exit 0 International Jazz event. Meet Your Music and award-winning, critically acclaimed artists, rising nouveau artists, and local favorites. Join Headliners who perform at Cape May Convention Hall, and sample over 30 sets of music in intimate club venues in this veritable jazz village. Be Seduced and Fall in Love with the Four Headliners The Cookers - This jazz supergroup, a melting pot of melodic, harmonic sophistication, (sax, trumpet, piano, and drums) sets the mood for an evening of mesmerizing expectation. Jon Batiste & Stay Human -- Compelling, electric young artist, who hails from a New Orleans musical family, is a cast frequent on HBO's Treme, whose pure stamina, accessibility, and appreciation in live performance just may have you join in a ""second line."" Rene Marie: ""Vulnerability and Sensuality, they're sides of the same coin."" A top vocalist whose sultry, sensuous voice works like a magnet to draw you into the mood. Monty Alexander & the Harlem-Kingston Express - Influenced by Louis Armstrong and Nat King Cole, he also accompanied Jersey idol Frank Sinatra at ""Jilly's"" a New York City club in 1963. This legendary pianist provides a blending chemistry of Jamaican reggae and North American jazz and will be a sensational climax to the evening.

DigestifThe drink, ""Sex on the Beach"" has a few variations, from the International Bartenders Official Association version to the one favored by Hard Rock Cafe. Regardless of preference, the combinations as well as variety define Shore Music, and frequently new ingredients and blends thrown in on the spur. Still, there is a tradition and style that flows like a current and a warm Summer breeze. -- Reminisce Frank Sinatra, New Jersey's own, and his rendition of ""Summer Wind.""Susan Sacirbey @DiplomaticallyXPERSONAL SUMMER PHOTO ALBUM: Celebrating with Kermit Ruffins - Cape May &  Summer Stage of Songwriters on the Beach - Belmar"
