Per The Shanghaiist, Chinese visitors to the so-called ""hermit kingdom"" have also been known to pick up ""bewildered"" North Korean children in the middle of their school performances to pose with them for pictures.These examples are but the latest in a trend of misbehaving Chinese tourists, attributed to the country's increasingly wealthy citizens. One of these visitors drew international outrage after he carved his name into a 3,500-year-old temple in Egypt.""Overseas travel is a new luxury, Chinese who can afford it compare with each other and want to show off,"" explained Liu Simin, a researcher with the Tourism Research Center of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, in an interview with Reuters.

While there, I'll teach a class on data journalism, offer a lecture series to other members of the department about the work we do with data, conduct research about the impact of a landmark 2009 freedom of information law, and work to serve as a bridge between my Chilean colleagues and people I know who do the same work in Spanish- and non-Spanish speaking countries. I'll also be doing some freelance work for Hoy, the Chicago Tribune's Spanish-language newspaper where I've worked since March 2011. I'll chronicle where things stand in the country that is just a generation removed from a brutal dictatorship, learn how better to write computer code, and work on some personal projects.And, when it's over, I get my job back at Hoy.To be able to go to another land is an enormous gift; to be able to do so with job security is even greater. Returning to Hoy and working at a place that supports this kind of striving and professional growth are just two of the many reasons I'm thrilled about the experience. In fact, we've wanted to go to the land of Nobel laureates Pablo Neruda and Gabriela Mistral for more than a decade.Dear friend, poet, human rights activist and generous soul Marjorie Agosin, a Chilean native who was a teenager in Athens, Georgia when the coup that toppled the democratically-elected Salvador Allende from power, has been our inspiration and our guide about her homeland. Dunreith and I read Neruda's Sonnet XVII to each other during our elopement and our subsequent public marriage ceremony at Look Park:I do not love you as if you were salt-rose, or topaz, or the arrow of carnations the fire shoots off. I love you as certain dark things are to be loved, in secret, between the shadow and the soul.I love you as the plant that never blooms but carries in itself the light of hidden flowers; thanks to your love a certain solid fragrance, risen from the earth, lives darkly in my body.I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you straightforwardly, without complexities or pride; so I love you because I know no other waythan this: where I does not exist, nor you, so close that your hand on my chest is my hand, so close that your eyes close as I fall asleep. There is the nation's trauma from the Pinochet era that Patricio Guzman depicted so hauntingly in his documentary film, ""Nostalgia for the Light.""As someone who counts attending South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1996 as a life thrill, I've studied the Chilean version of the TRC that was held earlier than the one in South Africa, but didn't go nearly as long or probe as deeply.There is the chance for Dunreith and me to truly immerse ourselves in Spanish. And there is the opportunity to travel to Argentina in September to meet with colleagues doing innovative work at the Argentinian paper La Nacion, and to fly in October to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil to attend the Global Investigative Journalism Conference. Dunreith and I are also thrilled to have this adventure as the first chapter in a new stage of our lives.After months of decluttering and painting and fixing and staging and showing and inspecting and appraising, we sold our house yesterday. This means that we've got no home address in the United States.It also means that we're free in a way that we've not been for the past decade.We've loved the house in many ways.It's where we've spent the vast majority of our married life, the place where we raised Aidan from a boy to a man, where we both turned 45 and Dunreith turned 50. We lived at 1509 South Boulevard while Dunreith's parents Marty and Helen and my stepmother Diane faltered before passing. It's the location where Aidan has lived longer than anywhere else.And yet, for years really, and especially after Aidan graduated from high school and attended Tulane, the house has felt larger and more expensive than what we needed.As of Wednesday morning, it belongs to someone else.Selling the house and setting off to Chile is not only the beginning of a new adventure for us.It's more confirmation that we can indeed live a life of choosing each day what we want to do and how we want to do it, that we can align our deepest dreams and most basic values with our daily actions, and that, while the end will inevitably come, it is possible to savor richly layered moments of joy in which we appreciate the past, work to the future and always, always live in the present.I can look across Dunreith and out the window and see the snow-capped Andes in the distance. We land in 10 minutes.Our adventure has already begun.This article first appeared on http:www.kellylowenstein.wordpress.com."

(Photo by Chris McKay/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badebc72400003000964881.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Rocker Ted Nugent allegedly fueled the flames of an already fiery rhetoric regarding Trayvon Martin this weekend when he said the unarmed ""gangsta wannabe"" teen ""got justice"" when he was shot and killed by George Zimmerman. In an interview aired on Maine's WGAN Saturday, the 64-year-old Detriot native mentioned Martin when the discussion turned to recent protests of his New Haven, Conn., concert, according to the New Haven Register. Protests were planned in response to Nugent's recent description of Martin as a ""dope smoking, racist gangsta wannabe,"" Hartford's WFSB reported. Thousands have signed a petition asking Toad's Place in New Haven to cancel the Aug. 6 show. On Saturday, he doubled down on those very comments. “Trayvon got justice,"" he said, according to the Register. He reportedly added that the 17-year-old was a “gangsta wannabe” who had a “bloodthirst,” a quality he claims is supported by the fact Martin was eager to “get into fights with people.”Last month, the ""Motor City Madman"" made headlines for comments he made about the Zimmerman trial in an op-ed for conservative news site, Rare.us. Nugent wrote that Zimmerman should sue Martin's family for emotional suffering. ""Trayvon Martin’s vicious attack on George Zimmerman and Martin’s tragic death have no doubt surely dragged Mr. Zimmerman through 18 months of untold emotional hell, pain, distress, anguish, fatigue, nightmares and financial ruin,"" he wrote. ""Again, following the narrative of the pro-Trayvon media types and other race-baiters, if Trayvon Martin was a minor, then Trayvon Martin’s parents may be held liable for the emotional pain and suffering Mr. Zimmerman has been put through for the past 18 months, and surely for the rest of his life.""Still, Nugent has insisted he is ""anti-racist."" (h/t Think Progress) Clarification: Ted Nugent's interview was conducted by ""The Weekend,"" a nationally syndicated radio show distributed by Premiere Radio Networks that airs on dozens of radio stations across the nation. The interview aired on WGAN. Language has been changed to clarify this. "

Brown Convention Center in Houston, Texas, U.S., on Saturday, May 4, 2013. After the U.S. Senate defeated a proposed expansion of background checks on gun purchases, the NRA's annual conference has a celebratory atmosphere. Yet as the festivities began, gun-control advocates swarmed town halls, organizing petitions and buying local ads to pressure senators from Alaska to New Hampshire to reconsider the measure that failed by six votes on April 17.

President Barack Obama has been rebuffed by Congress in his efforts to tighten gun laws, and the NRA has staunchly opposed gun control.Prominently featured in the museum are firearms used by historical figures - an engraved shotgun presented by Napoleon Bonaparte to a general in his army, guns from Missouri-born Old West outlaw Jesse James and weapons used in Western movies by tough-guy actors John Wayne and Clint Eastwood.One of the dioramas shows President Theodore Roosevelt, an outdoor enthusiast and avid hunter, on safari. Another depicts explorers Lewis and Clark, who mapped the vast Louisiana purchase, from St. Louis to the Pacific Coast, in the early 1800s.The museum incorporates reminders of the NRA mission - to defend the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution setting out the right to bear arms. One of the galleries, named ""Second Amendment"" includes a copy of the wording in the amendment, Supica said.Marketing materials touting the museum say it ""illustrates themes of hunting, conservation and freedom.""But the museum is ""not political,"" Supica said. It traces the history of guns in America, from the Revolution against British rule in the 18th century.The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, whose aim is to ""enact and enforce sensible gun laws,"" did not respond to a call and email for comment about the museum.Bass Pro Shops founder Johnny Morris, who started the hunting and fishing gear business in the early 1970s by making fishing lures, proposed the Missouri location after visiting the NRA's National Firearms Museum in Fairfax, Virginia.The Bass Pro store in Springfield has about four million visitors annually and is one of the state's top tourist destinations, said Tammy Sapp, Bass Pro spokeswoman.Like other Bass Pro Shops around the country, the Springfield store has fish and wildlife displays that recreate natural habitats, as well as stuffed and mounted wildlife. Springfield is the privately held retail chain's flagship store. (Reporting by Kevin Murphy; Editing by Greg McCune and Gunna Dickson) "
