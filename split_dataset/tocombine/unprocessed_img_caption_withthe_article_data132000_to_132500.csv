By,2014-01-12,"FILE - In this Jan. 18, 2008 file photo, a customer signs his credit card receipt at a Target store in Tallahassee, Fla. The U.S. is the juiciest target for hackers hunting credit card information. And experts say incidents like the recent data theft at Target's stores will get worse before they get better. That's in part because U.S. credit and debit cards rely on an easy-to-copy magnetic strip on the back of the card, which stores account information using the same technology as cassette tapes. The breach that exposed the credit card and debit card information of as many as 40 million Target customers who swiped their cards between Nov. 27 and Dec. 15 is still under investigation. (AP Photo/Phil Coale, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3060b3c000066000c4488.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jim Finkle and Mark HosenballBOSTON/WASHINGTON, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Target Corp and Neiman Marcus are not the only U.S. retailers whose networks were breached over the holiday shopping season last year, according to sources familiar with attacks on other merchants that have yet to be publicly disclosed.Smaller breaches on at least three other well-known U.S. retailers took place and were conducted using similar techniques as the one on Target, according to the people familiar with the attacks. Those breaches have yet to come to light. Also, similar breaches may have occurred earlier last year.The sources said that they involved retailers with outlets in malls, but declined to elaborate. They also said that while they suspect the perpetrators may be the same as those who launched the Target attack, they cannot be sure because they are still trying to find the culprits behind all of the security breaches.Law enforcement sources have said they suspect the ring leaders are from Eastern Europe, which is where most big cyber crime cases have been hatched over the past decade.Only one well-known retailer, Neiman Marcus, has said that they too have been victim of a cyber attack since Target's Dec. 19 disclosure that some 40 million payment card numbers had been stolen in a cyber attack. On Friday, Target said the data breach was worse than initially thought.An investigation found that hackers stole the personal information of at least 70 million customers, including names, mailing addresses, telephone numbers and email addresses. Neiman Marcus said it was not sure if the breach was related to the Target incident.Most states have laws that require companies to contact customers when certain personal information is compromised. In many cases the task of notification falls on the credit card issuer.Merchants are required to report breaches of personal information including social security numbers. It was not immediately clear if that was the case with the retailers who were attacked around the same time as Target.The Secret Service and Department of Justice, which are investigating the Target breach, declined to comment on Saturday. SCRAPING MEMORYTarget has not disclosed how the attackers managed to breach its network or siphon off some of its most sensitive data.The sources who spoke to Reuters about the breaches said that investigators believe the attackers used similar techniques and pieces of malicious software to steal data from Target and other retailers.One of the pieces of malware they used was something known as a RAM scraper, or memory-parsing software, which enables cyber criminals to grab encrypted data by capturing it when it travels through the live memory of a computer, where it appears in plain text, the sources said.While the technology has been around for many years, its use has increased in recent years as retailers have improved their security, making it more difficult for hackers to obtain credit card data using other approaches.Visa Inc issued two alerts last year about a surge in cyber attacks on retailers that specifically warned about the threat from memory parsing malware.The alerts, published in April and August, provided retailers with technical details on how the attacks were launched and advice on thwarting them.A Visa spokeswoman declined comment on the reports, which did not identify specific victims.It was not clear whether Target's security team had implemented the measures that Visa had recommended to mitigate the risks of being attacked.Yet a law enforcement source familiar with the breach said that even if the retailer had implemented those steps, the efforts may not have succeeded in stopping the attack.That is because the attackers were more sophisticated than the ones in the previous attacks described in the Visa alerts, according to the source. The source asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. DELAYED DISCLOSURERetailers are often reluctant to report breaches out of concern it could hurt their businesses. Target only acknowledged its 2013 attack after security blogger Brian Krebs reported the breach, prompting inquiries from journalists and investors.Neiman Marcus said an outside forensics firm discovered evidence on Jan. 1 that indicated the retailer had been the victim of a cyber attack. It disclosed the breach nine days later, after another inquiry from Krebs, who was following up on reports about a surge in fraudulent charges traced to the retailer.Target and J.C. Penney Co Inc. waited more than two years to admit that they were victims in 2007 of notorious hacker Albert Gonzalez, who was accused of masterminding the theft and reselling of millions of credit cards and ATM numbers.During his trial the companies were represented by lawyers who did not identify their clients as Target and J.C Penney.Doug Johnson, vice president of risk management policy with the American Bankers Association, said banks and credit card firms like Visa are forbidden from naming merchants that have been breached, unless they disclose it themselves.""It is really frustrating to the bank and also the customer,"" Johnson said.One of the sources who told Reuters about the recent rash of attacks said the memory parsing malware cited in the Visa reports was among the tools that the hackers had used, but said they used other techniques as well.Target spokeswoman Molly Snyder said the retailer is not commenting on the company's investigation of the breach.""This continues to be an active and ongoing investigation. It would be inappropriate to discuss details at this point.""Avivah Litan, a security analyst for Stamford, Connecticut -based Gartner information technology research firm, said she learned about a separate set of breaches, dating back no more than a few months before the Nov. 28 Thanksgiving Day start of the holiday shopping season, from a forensics investigator. She declined to provide his name.""Target was not the only retailer who got hit, but they got hit the biggest,"" Litan said.Investigators believe that the early series of attacks on retailers staged before late November were mostly used as trial attacks to help the hackers perfect new techniques they then used against Target, stealing payment cards at unprecedented speed, Litan said.Chris Gray, director of Denver, Colorado -based Accuvant information security firm's risk and compliance practice, said that sophisticated cyber crime groups do that because they only have once chance to get it right before victims catch on.""You want to test it and make sure it works,"" Gray said. ""Then you push it out at the appropriate time and do as much damage as you can."" (Reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston and Mark Hosenball in Washington; Editing by Grant McCool)"

They will compete for best motion picture in different categories, drama and comedy or musical, respectively.""Gravity,"" starring Sandra Bullock as an astronaut lost in space and life, also ranks high in experts' predictions and could give ""12 Years a Slave"" a challenge for the night's most coveted award, best drama.Golden Globes are also given out for television, where established dramas like ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Downton Abbey"" will compete with the likes of Netflix newcomer ""House of Cards.""The Golden Globes, under the purview of some 90 journalists in the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, have outsized clout in the awards race as buzz around these first honors influences members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in their voting for the Oscars, which will be handed out March 2.""You can just see the Oscar voter who starts to hear the buzz build for '12 Years a Slave,' and has been dreading picking up the (DVD) screener to watch the movie,"" said Keith Simanton, managing editor for the IMDB movie site.""But he reaches for it, and says to his wife, 'Maybe we ought to watch it.'""Oscar nominations will be announced on Thursday, but voting has already concluded. The Globes have a mixed record when it comes to predicting the Oscar best picture, though last year's best drama winner, ""Argo,"" did go on to win the Academy Award for best movie.The Golden Globes follow a very good year for film, both commercially and critically. North American box office receipts totaled a record $10.9 billion in 2013 and top performers went beyond the typical blockbuster action movies to include acclaimed films such as ""Gravity.""Sunday night could also boost the fortunes of smaller films that have fared well among critics, including Joel and Ethan Coen's paean to 1960s folk music ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" Spike Jonze's quirky computer-age romance ""Her,"" and Alexander Payne's homage to the heartland ""Nebraska."" OSCAR-WINNING WOMEN COMPETEThe intense competition extends to the acting races, where Britain's Chiwetel Ejiofor will compete for best actor in a drama for his role as the free man sold into slavery in ""12 Years a Slave."" Matthew McConaughey is also considered a frontrunner for his portrayal of an unlikely AIDS activist in ""Dallas Buyers Club,"" for which he lost 50 pounds.Leonardo DiCaprio will get his shot at best actor in a comedy or musical for his turn as a swindling stockbroker in Martin Scorsese's tale of American greed, ""The Wolf of Wall Street."" He has stiff competition from veteran actor Bruce Dern as a cantankerous and delusional father in ""Nebraska.""For best actress in a drama, it's a battle between Oscar winners, with Bullock going up against Cate Blanchett for her riches-to-rags role in Woody Allen's ""Blue Jasmine"" and Judi Dench for her turn as a mother looking for a long-lost son in adoption drama ""Philomena.""The HFPA will also honor Woody Allen with the Cecil B DeMille award recognizing outstanding contribution to the entertainment field. Allen, famously averse to awards shows, is not expected to collect the honor, but one of his favorite actresses, Diane Keaton, will reportedly stand in for him.While considered a warm-up for the Academy Awards, the Golden Globes live telecast on Comcast Corp's NBC network offers many of the same ingredients, such as the glamour of the red carpet for Hollywood's leading ladies and the dense concentration of Tinseltown's top talent in one room.But the Globes serve up cocktails and an air of whimsy and unpredictability in contrast to the more tightly scripted Academy Awards.Comedians Tina Fey and Amy Poehler will return to host the Golden Globes for the second consecutive year."

5,QUEER VOICES,Who's Better-Looking: Gay or Straight Porn Stars?,"Michael Alvear, Contributor

Is that true? We didn't want to define beauty, so we thought we'd let the public do it. As the poll progresses (you can vote here), we were struck by a couple of things in our preparation for it:1. It's difficult to find G-rated pictures of straight porn stars. The gay ones? They were everywhere. Why would that be? Men are the stars in gay porn and simply a prop in heterosexual porn. It makes sense that gay performers would be given the star treatment -- from G-rated model shoots to triple-X peep pics. Conversely, straight performers act as the velvet pillow for the crown jewels (women). No one seems interested in photographing the velvet.2. Gay performers clearly work out more than their straight counterparts. Appeal is a tricky thing and subject to individual preference, so we won't pass judgment on who's hotter, but the differences in fitness between the two groups of men is undeniable. You could grate cheese on many of the gay performers' abs. The straight ones? Well, you could roll dough. 3. Gay performers tend to be younger and more wholesome-looking. That doesn't make them hotter than their straight counterparts, but we were struck by the differences between gay and straight leading men. As we went through an avalanche of pictures for our poll, we couldn't help but notice that straight performers tended to be older and more Regular Joe-ish. 4. Straight performers have a wider variety of looks. ""The look"" is a function of the porn studio, but there is definitely a wider variance in the type of look men have in straight porn compared with gay porn. In straight porn, you'll see every body type represented, from skinny to muscular to fat, hairless to hairy, short to tall. Gay porn tends to present a much narrower view of men's bodies. Skinny is as rare as fat. It's all muscle-a-go-go. It's admittedly difficult to make side-by-side comparisons between men in gay and straight porn. To even everything out, we chose the most recognizable porn stars working today. By ""recognizable"" we mean that the performers either starred in recent, bestselling videos, are veterans with a long body of work or have won industry awards for their performances (like AVN Awards, considered the ""Porn Oscars"").Larry Flynt, the publisher of Hustler, once said, ""There are two kinds of people who oppose porn. Those who don't know what they're talking about and those who don't know what they're missing."" We agree, so don't forget to vote!Michael Alvear is the founder of the gay dating advice site Gay Dating Success."
