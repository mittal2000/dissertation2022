Remember them? This 1980s satirical troupe of anti-feminists called for abolishing the environment: ""It takes up too much space, and is almost impossible to keep clean.""After 30 years of being an activist, I had to wonder -- has it really been all for nothing? In fact, no. Thinking back to a few of the most memorable environmental campaign victories from my own experience, it's fair to say that had they not been won, the world would be even closer to -- perhaps already beyond -- that catastrophic tipping point, the point of no return, which the UNEP report warns us about.Here are some examples:1. Starting with the one closest to my heart, Antarctica. From 1982-1988, a handful of countries -- self-appointed stewards of one of the most hostile and environmentally sensitive places on earth -- negotiated a convention to open up Antarctica to oil drilling and mining. As the first Director of the Australian Antarctic envisaged it in 1964 (PDF):... mining deep inside the rock of the peripheral mountains of Antarctica will proceed throughout the long winter months... hollowed out of the rock, irradiated with simulated sunshine generated electrically from nuclear power, the mining townships will be independent of surface weather conditions and shift work will proceed around the clock... By 1990, after eight years of intensive campaigning, defying the prevailing wisdom which considered our call for a ""World Park"" unrealistic, the Antarctic Treaty Parties did an about-face. In two short years, they went from unanimously supporting the mining convention to rejecting it and unanimously supporting a comprehensive protection agreement instead. As I was often quoted as saying at the time, ""if we can't save Antarctica, what hope do we have of saving the rest of the planet?"" 2. Global Ban on Ocean Dumping. It's hard to believe that as recently as 30 years ago, the world's open oceans were treated with little more regard than an open sewer. Companies and governments routinely chartered vessels to dump their garbage, including toxic chemical and radioactive waste, straight into the sea (PDF).As the campaign against ocean dumping began to bite in the 1980s, and rules for dumping at sea were tightened, they came up with other creative solutions for disposing of the nastiest stuff -- like depositing it under the seabed, or incinerating it at sea. Out of sight, out of mind, and out of the public eye... or so they'd hoped. By 1993, one year after the first Rio Earth Summit, these practices were banned permanently worldwide, and there are no longer any country objections to the agreement. If you think fish stocks are in trouble now, just imagine where they'd be had it not been for this campaign.Activists blocking nuclear waste dumping. Photo courtesy of Greenpeace /Pierre Gleize, 19823. Offshore Oil Drilling. On July 21, 1982, two days after I started my first campaigning job (at Greenpeace in Boston), U.S. Interior Sec. James Watt offered up the entire U.S. outer continental shelf -- a total of a billion acres -- for oil and gas exploration and development.His highest priority was to lease ""frontier"" areas, and he was prepared to sacrifice some of the U.S.'s most environmentally sensitive marine ecosystems -- off of Alaska, California and New England. (Come to think of it, the plan was not dissimilar to that of Stephen Harper's all-out offensive to develop Canadian tar sands).As a result of the campaign against the Watt plan -- during which I once bid on 500 tracks on Georges Bank with no legal consequences I might add -- Congress passed a moratorium on leasing many of the most sensitive areas. The ban on new offshore oil development was reapproved annually up until 2008, and as a result of the Deepwater Horizon accident, offshore policy still remains in flux.These were not just paper tigers, agreements made then left on the shelf to rot. Some might suggest that these were somehow easy victories, clear cut black-and-white cases compared to the complexity of the issues to be addressed at next week's Earth Summit in Rio. In some respects this is true, but all I can say is they didn't feel easy at the time.If I've learned anything over the last 30 years, it's the importance of having impossible ambitions. As Nelson Mandela once said, ""it always seems impossible until it's done."""
6,WELLNESS,Becoming a Creative Warrior,"Amy Neumann, Contributor
Social Good Devotee; Founder, Free Tech for Nonprofits",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/creativity_us_5b9bd19de4b03a1dcc7a7e28,How can we manifest the creative impulse we feel?

We wonder: How can we produce high-quality work? How can we manifest the creative impulse we feel? Too often a creative drive that we experience can spark but then fizzle out because of our lack of confidence. We worry. How can what I produce be valuable when there is so much that is beautiful and intelligent around me? We want to know. How can I, as an artist, writer, business leader, develop a productive, meaningful path to creativity? Chogyam Trungpa's seminal book, Shambhala: The Sacred Path of the Warrior, describes a potential path for those interested in spiritual development, including meditative and loving-kindness practices. His words are also apt inspiration for those of us exploring our creative dimension. Trungpa advises us to ""feel that you are not special, but ordinary, extra-ordinary."" His advice seems contradictory, especially when we apply it to the creative urge. We've been trained by history and society to believe that the ""true"" creative must be special, different, even elevated. But living with the ordinary as Trongpa suggests helps us see that this is not so. Instead, we can begin our journey by adopting some of these ""ordinary"" tenets inspired by his teachings: Notice that goodness is all around us. Begin to notice the brief, beautiful moments that your interaction with the world brings you. The sound of a bird's wings as it moves from branch to branch, the flash of sun coming from behind a cloud, your child's hug (no matter how quick and rare). This appreciation allows you to see just how lovely the ordinary is. In the words of acclaimed painting instructor Charles Hawthorne: ""Anything under the sun is beautiful if you have the vision -- it is the seeing of the thing that makes it so.""The beauty of a moment captured - photo courtesy of Steve-H on FlickrAcknowledge that you are fearful. Let's face it. Creating is daunting. Living is difficult. How much of your day do you spend masking the fear (which can manifest in all sorts of ways) -- are you neglecting writing that book, starting a painting, crafting a business idea? Are you instead tweeting (too much), checking email, having a little more wine than is useful for clear creative expression? All distractions. If you can stay with your fear, letting yourself experience rather than avoid it, you may find other feelings within the fear. There might be sadness, anger or anxiety. Or all three! In any case, your goal here is to be gentle with yourself. Now is not the time to add to the fear by piling on criticism. Be tender with yourself. Forgive yourself for perceived lapses and inadequacies. You will find yourself much more able to free up your creative flow.Be simple. The most effective works get the basic stuff right. Whether it is composition, narrative structure or the moving crescendo of a speech, remember the essentials and get them right. How easy it is to over-complicate things and to stray from our core idea! If you can capture what it is that inspired you to begin your project in the first place and keep referring back to it as you move along, you will help yourself immensely. This is not to say that things don't evolve as you develop them. It is merely that we can fall through one rabbit hole after another until we are past the point of no return. ""Before you can think out of the box, you have to start with a box."" -- Twyla Tharp, The Creative Habit: Learn It and Use It for Life Chaos. It's everywhere. And there's nothing wrong with letting it nudge you out of complacency. So, while you keep it simple, you play at the edges. Think of any practice that you are working to perfect. It isn't static. Instead, once you have mastered one element, you realize that there is more to learn. In Trongpa's tradition, the closest corollary is coming back to the breath in meditation. We sit and our mind wanders. And we bring it back, acknowledging that our mind has strayed and appreciating that we can return again and again to our foundation, our idea. As long as I tell the truth, I feel that nobody can touch me. -- Henry RollinsBe true to yourself. At base, Trongpa's message is to be truthful and kind -- advice that applies directly to our creative selves. It is not about the labels you give yourself or your work, no matter what your work may be. It is, in the end, you and an ordinary white canvas, a blank page, an expectant audience. If you can gaze at the empty space and connect with your common, ordinary human impulse you will see that you are no more special than the rest of humanity. And that is okay. As you connect to your work and your audience with humility and honesty, the impact of your desire to connect will feed you and will inspire others. It is you, extra-ordinary in your ordinary approach to what inspires, that will produce the most truthful, moving work.Eliza Wing, the former president and CEO of Cleveland.com and president of Sideways, now runs Wing Consulting.
