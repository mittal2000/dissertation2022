International messages of congratulations poured in for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge following the birth of the third in line to the throne, celebrated by gunfire salutes across London. AFP PHOTO / WILL OLIVER (Photo credit should read WILL OLIVER/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d5fed2500003300366ee1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When a baby is born, there are actually two stages to the birthing process. The first delivers the baby. The second delivers the ""after birth"" -- tangible evidence of all of the hard work the mother's body has performed to ensure the baby reaches its fullest potential prior to being released from its mother's care. It's the ""work"" underlying the ""hope"" that every new baby brings to the world... a means of the body doing its job in ""parenting"" prior to the child's parents doing theirs. Once that child is born, however, the mother's body dispels of this responsibility rather quickly, placing it squarely in mom and dad's hands to continue the work and carry forth the hope. And it's then that a whole new phase of birthing takes place -- the outcome of which relying heavily upon the choices both parents make in the creation of the environment they provide for the child to grow up in.This week The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge join millions of parents in the latter phase of parenting, one which will necessitate very active roles in ensuring their child fulfills their personal hopes as well as the hopes of an entire country and world... no small task for certain. I have a feeling, though, that the Duke and Duchess will do just fine in their new roles as parents as neither of them seems to shy away from hard work or responsibility and they certainly have proven themselves to be respectful and loving towards each other and the monarch. In this particular case, hope and children have been given a very strong foundation in which to make history beyond just their obvious destiny. This is not always the case unfortunately, as many children are born to parents who fail to realize what ""parenting"" truly means, misconstruing a nourishing environment for one that offers ease and lacks the vital nutrients essential for children and hope to flourish. If any couple had the means of which to fall into this trapping, it would be The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. And yet, I hardly doubt this will occur.""Parenting"" is hard work folks and it's never ending! You can't avoid it, buy yourself out of it or camouflage what happens if you don't take it seriously. The big picture just won't let you do so and it will punish you gravely if you try... not to mention your children. We've all seen this, whether it be in our own backyards or in the tabloids as many notable names' children make us privy to the failings that celebrity cast down upon their families. Their tales of suicide, alcoholism, drug abuse, violent behavior, and criminal offenses are quite sad and reflective of priorities gone awry.The word ""parent"" isn't just a title granted us when ""one and one make"" three. It requires us to be grownups all the time and at the expense of ourselves if necessary. To accept reality, make the best of every circumstance, grab hold of happiness, find strength when we can barely stand, and cling to our own hope so that our children may learn to cling to theirs. It implores sticking to the plan Mother Nature set forth upon conception so that we may craft the optimum environment for our child to grow. The process is clear and stands as a guiding light in the face of many pertinent choices we will make down the line. It's not easy, but when done properly, it's worth every painstaking moment. What better way to live a life than to bring hope into the world in the form of a child. I'm sure the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are saying something very similar to this right about now as their little bundle captivates them prior to captivating the world. There may be many hard days of work to come but as Mother Nature has already proven to them, hard work pays off.In this case... it brought forth a future king! Congratulations to the Royal Family and all of England!"

Article by the Editors of Budget Travel.Whether you're headed to the Emerald Isle any time soon or simply window-shopping, we've rounded up 10 of the best attractions Ireland has to offer, from natural wonders on the Atlantic coast to Dublin's literary highlights, a world-famous castle, and traditional music and merriment.SEE 35 STUNNING PHOTOS OF IRELANDDavy Byrnes PubThis establishment on Dublin's Duke Street is mentioned in Irish novelist James Joyce's masterpiece, Ulysses, and attracts visitors from around the world for precisely that reason. Stop in for a pint of stout and a taste of the famed Dublin wit at the heart of Joyce's work.Abbey TheatreHaving presented the work of playwrights such as William Butler Yeats, John Millington Synge, and Samuel Beckett, Dublin's Abbey Theatre can rightly claim to be the treasure house of Irish literary culture. Catch a play, then follow the actors to a favorite nearby haunt, the Flowing Tide, for refreshment.Trinity CollegeFounded in the 16th century by Queen Elizabeth I, this college, on the south bank of the River Liffey in central Dublin, boasts alumni that include Jonathan Swift, Oscar Wilde, and Samuel Beckett. Today, it is home to the iconic Book of Kells, a spectacular illuminated manuscript from the Middle Ages.NewgrangeIn County Meath, about 30 miles northwest of Dublin, this prehistoric passage tomb (a narrow passage made of large stones with a covered burial chamber) takes you back to 4000 B.C., a thousand years before England's Stonehenge. During the winter solstice, the rising sun shines through a small opening above the tomb's doorway, illuminating the chamber.Blarney CastleYup, it's as touristy as it gets, but countless visitors have made the five-mile pilgrimage from Cork City to this impressive tower to kiss the legendary Blarney Stone (by some thoroughly unreliable accounts, a fragment of Jerusalem's Wailing Wall) in hopes of acquiring the gift of gab. Before you schlep all the way, be warned: In order for your lips to reach the storied stone, you have to lean backward over a parapet with an attendant holding your legs to keep you from falling.Aran IslandsA short boat ride from Rossaveal or Doolin will take you to these islands off the Atlantic coast where the Irish language is still spoken. The smallest of the islands, Inisheer, is like a time capsule of ancient Ireland, with its patchwork of fields and stone walls; the Hotel Inisheer is famed for traditional Irish music and merrymaking.Cliffs of MoherTowering 700 feet above the roaring Atlantic Ocean, these shale and sandstone cliffs, near the village of Liscannor about halfway between Kerry and Connemara, make you feel as if you are standing on the edge of the world. A visitors' center offers guided tours and on clear days you can see past the Aran Islands all the way to Connemara.Skellig MichaelA 700-foot-high rock that rises from the sea off the Iveragh Peninsula in County Kerry, Skellig Michael can be reached by an hour-long boat ride from Valentia Island. But when you disembark your journey isn't complete; you can climb 650 small steps cut out of the rock to see the remains of a 7th-century Christian monastery.Maamturk MountainsGalway has been a mecca for cyclists for years, and the Maamturk Mountains offer gentle climbs that take you past pristine lakes and bogs, plus the opportunity to coast down into tiny Leenane, where the Atlantic Ocean flows into Killary Harbour.Glenveagh National ParkNorth of Galway, this isolated park is home to red deer and falcons and offers some of the most beautiful hiking, such as the Derrylahan Trail and the Glen Walk through the Derryveagh Mountains.More From Budget Travel: Eat Like a Local: Dublin 35 Stunning Photos of Ireland 15 Things You Didn't Know About Ireland Genealogy Travel: Find Your Roots in IrelandWant the inside scoop on the hottest travel deals?

2,PARENTING,Dadmissions: Parenting Advice For Will and Kate,"Pete Wilgoren, Contributor
Contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dadmissions-parenting-adv_us_5b9d5e62e4b03a1dcc87236a,I wanted to congratulate you on your upcoming new arrival and offer some sage advice from parents everywhere. You are in for incredible changes just ahead including a major lack of sleep for your servants and staff and nurses.,2013-07-22,"NEW YORK, NY - JULY 22: A sign in the window of the British restaurant and grocery Tea & Sympathy reads. 'It's A Boy' as it celebrates the birth of Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, and her husband Prince William's first child on July 22, 2013 in New York City. The Royal couple had a baby boy who was born at 16.24 BST and weighed 8 pounds, 6 ounces. The child, who is now third in line to the throne, has yet to be named. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d5e6226000036007fd830.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dear William and Catherine, I wanted to congratulate you on your upcoming new arrival and offer some sage advice from parents everywhere. You are in for incredible changes just ahead including a major lack of sleep for your servants and staff and nurses. Babies don't sleep much and they do tend to keep an entire palace awake. We'd always sooth our babies to sleep with Baby Einstein music and one of those mobiles which shines stars on the ceiling (not sure if they work on 30 foot, gold leafed ceilings, with custom crown molding). I don't know if you are registered at Babies R Us or not, but William, IKEA furniture for baby comes in very handy and it is super affordable although not-so-easy to put together, just make sure to keep a ziploc bag of all the spare pieces you're left with at the end when you build something. Also, we've had extremely good luck with the Diaper Genie when it comes to keeping our castle smelling nice, the diapers come out looking like a beautiful white set of heirloom pearls if you use it right. You and Catherine can do paper, rock, and scissors to see who empties it. Make sure the royal chef stashes a box of Cheerios when your baby starts to eat solids: kids love Cheerios, homemade mac and cheese, hot dogs, and those apple sauce squeezers, I'm sure you've seen them at your local Trader Joe's when you grocery shop. When it comes to clothes, the baby should have lots of Osh Kosh clothes, Childrens Place clothes, oh and you can both save BIG if you cash in your Gym Bucks at Gymboree every few months; just watch the expiration date because when it's passed, it's too late. As far as entertaining the kids, they love bounce houses, zoos, park playgrounds, and many places accessible via limousine or private Lear Jet, just make sure to keep a DVD player for those long road trips with the kids to avoid the royal ""are we there yets."" Oh, by the way, I have an extra pack-n-play if you need it (those things are gold) and it's in pretty good condition still.But heed this advice, kids can get spoiled very easily. Did you ever see Silver Spoons? Ricky had a train and video games in his living room. Spoiled rich. He was a punk. Don't let that happen to your kids. And refuse the urge to put them on a reality TV show. Hangin' with the Royals might SOUND like a good idea, but trust me, it would be a royal boo boo to Kardashianize the Kids. Think about the long term. College is expensive nowadays. Remember to start a 529 plan for the kids so you afford school one day, and teach them the value of money, so they know about repaying all those student loans they'll have. I hope you and Catherine will be starting a Facebook page soon to update us on every single meal, step, and milestone your new baby makes. And you guys should be blogging. We look forward to it. And be sure to take lots of photos because I'm not sure there will be enough photographs and magazine covers and newspaper headlines. All kidding aside, kids grow up fast and yours will too. They will be growing up under a microscope of public adoration and scrutiny. Make sure to take some time and enjoy them out of the spotlight. How the grow up, the values they learn, and what they do with their lives all starts with YOU. Sincerely, DadmissionsWhat parenting advice would YOU give the royal couple?

I duck into Duane Reade, the only store there seems more of than even Starbucks in this town. In line with my items, I feel good energy from behind the register. This bright-eyed young woman is the source. While making change for the person in front of me, she breaks into song: ""These boots are made for walkin', and that's just what they'll do!... here you go hon, have yourself a great day... I mean a great night... whatever."" She riffs, with a sparkling New York-ese, Latina lilt. I step up and say ""You could just play it safe and say 'have a great life' and you'd cover all the bases!"" ""That's a good point!"" smiles Penélope. Hard to believe, but she gets bashful when I ask to make a picture, so I invite her friends Evette and Jury to join in and promise to bring them prints. The next day I return with prints and at first don't see her -- she looks very different with her hair let down. I watch as she attends to a constant line of customers, including an older lady who questions everything on her receipt. Penélope takes care of her with equanimity and grace. Finally I give her the prints, which she loves. She invites me back in an hour to join her for her break, which I do. She gets a Subway half-sandwich, with chips and drink, and we head over to the fountain at Columbus Circle. Originally from the Dominican Republic (""DR"" as she says), one of 12 siblings (from multiple marriages) Penélope soon starts her third year of schooling in child education. She lives apart from her parents but stays in close contact with her mom -- her best friend -- back home. She thinks about acting and modeling but sighs -- ""I'm not tall enough."" ""Don't let that stop you if that's your dream!"" I encourage. ""I'm not sure -- I really love working with children... I don't smoke or drink and I barely go out with all my working. Tonight I might go dancing with my girlfriends. I love dancing! Mostly, I love the simple things in life. Sitting at this fountain, listening to the water, watching the children play. I was here with my boyfriend and he wanted to go and I said 'let's stay just a little longer.""' Our hour finished, her sandwich barely eaten, Penélope heads back to the store while I catch a northbound bus, thankful to the rain for introducing us.info@kindsightfoundation.org www.robertzuckerman.comFor more by Robert G.
