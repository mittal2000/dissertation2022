3,POLITICS,The Achievement Gap In High School Graduation Rates Appears To Be Narrowing,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-high-school-graduation-rates_n_6878362.html,,2015-03-16,"Education Secretary Arne Duncan speaks with reporters after he and Attorney General Eric Holder toured the Northern Virginia Juvenile Detention Center in Alexandria, Va., Monday, Dec. 8, 2014. Holder and Duncan used the event to announce guidelines aimed at providing quality educational services for youth in correctional facilities as part of President Barack Obama's My Brother's Keeper initiative. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8edaf210000d601c96c9a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Even though significantly more white and Asian/Pacific Islander students are graduating from high school than their Hispanic, black and American Indian peers, achievement gaps in this area still appear to be closing.Data released Monday by the U.S. Department of Education shows that the high school graduation rates for Hispanic, black, white, American Indian and Asian/Pacific Islander students all increased between the 2011-12 and 2012-13 school years. However, the rate of growth for some groups has been faster than for others, making it so the graduation rate gap between white students and black, Hispanic and American Indian students has narrowed over time.The release of this data comes a month after the DOE announced that national high school graduation rates had reached a historic high. During the 2012-13 school year, 81 percent of American students graduated from high school in four years. “America’s students have achieved another record-setting milestone,” Secretary of Education Arne Duncan said in a statement last month. “We can take pride as a nation in knowing that we’re seeing promising gains, including for students of color.”Monday’s announcement outlines the specific gains achieved by students of color.“The hard work of America’s educators, families, communities and students is paying off. This is a vital step toward readiness for success in college and careers for every student in this country,” Duncan said in a statement. “While these gains are promising, we know that we have a long way to go in improving educational opportunities for every student -- no matter their ZIP code -- for the sake of our young people and our nation’s economic strength.”The graph below shows what graduation rates looked like for each subgroup in 2012-13.On Monday, President Barack Obama met with leadership from the Council of the Great City Schools, a coalition that represents urban school districts throughout the country, about pressing education issues, including a rewrite of the No Child Left Behind Act. In the meeting, Obama reportedly cited these high graduation rates as evidence that his administration's school initiatives are working.Duncan also addressed members of the organization on Sunday at their annual legislative conference, according to Education Week. ""You could have said, 'stop, this is too hard... our kids can't do this' for whatever reason,"" Duncan said in reference to the group's work to improve graduation rates. ""You hear that, sadly, from other groups. [You] never hear that from here. And if we can continue to accelerate the pace of change, think what that means for our kids, and our families, and our communities, and our cities, and, ultimately, for our nation."" "
4,LATINO VOICES,Employment for Latinos Comes Back to Life,"Vanessa Cardenas, ContributorVice President, Progress 2050, Center for American Progress",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/employment-for-latinos-comes-back-to-life_b_6878406.html,"While Latinos have made significant strides in some industries that pay above average wages such as construction, Latinos still hold the highest concentration of workers in the lowest-paying industry -- services occupations.",2015-03-16,"FILE - In this Sept. 4, 2014 file photo, protestors, including Kris Varrette, right, chant for increased wages and union rights at fast food restaurants in Las Vegas. Wal-Martâs decision to raise hourly wages for its lowest-paid workers provides a glimmer of hope for others working at minimum wage or just above. Other retailers and fast food restaurants may now follow suit in order to hold on to employees. (AP Photo/John Locher, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baea4d5250000360037db15.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last Friday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) released their Employment Report for the month of February. The monthly ritual brought good news for the labor market. Overall, an additional 295,000 jobs were gained in the month of February, averaging out to nearly 300,000 over the past six months. The national unemployment rate fell to 5.5 percent, decreasing by 1.2 percentage points from just one year earlier.And while this month's jobs report showed robust macroeconomic growth, the report held even better news for some of the nation's most vulnerable communities -- people of color. Since February 2014, the Latino unemployment rate has fallen by 1.5 percentage points to 6.6 percent. The African American unemployment rate changed by 1.6 percentage points -- from 12 percent to 10.4 percent. Meanwhile, the white unemployment rate declined by 1.1 percentage points from one year earlier and still remains below the national average at 4.7 percent.Across the board, these communities have experienced strong job growth; however, Latinos, in particular, have seen massive economic gains since the end of the Great Recession. The Latino unemployment rate has fully recovered back to its pre-recession levels. This compares to a recovery of about 91 percent of the way for African Americans, 87 percent of the way for Asians and 96 percent of the way for White workers as of December 2014. Additionally, employment among Latinos has increased by 5 percent, compared to 3.8 percent for African Americans and 1.4 percent for whites. The increase is at least in part due to demographics where the average white worker is older than the average American, while the average Latino tends to be much younger. Despite post-Recession employment gains among Latinos in the labor force, struggles in educational attainment, occupational advancement and higher wages are still quite evident. The most recent BLS report on labor force characteristics shows that Latinos continue to struggle disproportionately to their ethnic and racial counterparts. Among Latinos in the labor force aged 25 and older, a whopping 29 percent had less than a high school diploma and 31 percent were high school graduates with no college degree. Educational attainment often leads to career advancement and increased earnings potential, and the lack thereof continues to stymie economic security for Latinos today. Meaning that Latinos continue to be pushed into low-wage work that often provides sub-par wages and lack employer-sponsored benefits that are crucial to achieving the American dream. BLS data shows that the median weekly earnings of a full-time Latino salary worker was only $578 in 2013, compared to $802 for white workers.While Latinos have made significant strides in some industries that pay above average wages such as construction, Latinos still hold the highest concentration of workers in the lowest-paying industry -- services occupations. It should come as no surprise then that Latinos also have the lowest concentration of workers in the highest-paying major occupational category -- management, professional and related occupations. Whereas only 20 percent of Latinos hold management, professional and related occupations, 50 percent of Asians, 29 percent of African Americans, and 39 percent of whites fall within this same category.  Given the population growth in the Latino community and the increasingly important role they play in our economy and future workforce, more needs to be done to close the gaps they face. Some state and local policymakers have already taken the first step towards raising wages for the Latino community. On January 1 of this year, the minimum wage rose for 20 states and D.C., and in total, 29 states and D.C. now have minimum wages above the federal minimum. This is a huge victory for Latinos as they are more likely to find themselves in low-wage work. Yet, policymakers need do more to ensure fair wages for Latinos and other struggling workers. A start would be to raise the federal minimum wage, strengthen collective bargaining rights, and invest in apprenticeship programs and STEM education. We need to develop targeted policies that promote educational and occupational advancement for communities of color. It's about time that Latinos begin to see their economic contributions translated to fair wages, and policymakers need to take steps to enable the economic recovery of all workers.

5,POLITICS,Mitt Romney Thinks Iran Is Like North Korea. Former Nuclear Negotiators Disagree.,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/romney-iran-north-korea_n_6873806.html,,2015-03-15,"Former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney answers questions during a question-and-answer period following his address to the student body and guests in Starkville, Miss., Wednesday, Jan. 28, 2015. Romney joked about his time as a candidate and addressed a number of world issues including terrorism, world economy and domestically ""the need for strong American leadership,"" and job creation for Americans. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8eda02100005002c96c90.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Joining the chorus of Republicans predicting doom-filled outcomes from negotiations over Iran’s nuclear program, Mitt Romney penned a USA Today op-ed on Friday, challenging President Barack Obama to walk away from the talks. Citing the nuclear-armed North Korea as an example, the two-time Republican presidential candidate warned that any agreement reached between Iran, the U.S. and its five negotiating partners would inevitably lead to the Islamic Republic obtaining nuclear weapons. This analysis, according to multiple nonproliferation experts, demonstrates a shallow and incomplete understanding of each state's nuclear programs and geopolitical aspirations. At the crux of Romney's argument is the notion that Iran’s leaders, like North Korea’s, are irrational and cannot be trusted to abide by the rules or calculus that compel decision-makers in the U.S. “Agreements with tyrants and fanatics have very short shelf lives,” wrote Romney, pointing to the collapse of the 1994 Agreed Framework, which required North Korea to dismantle its nuclear capabilities in exchange for fuel oil and light water reactors from the U.S.While the 1994 agreement collapsed in 2002, the op-ed fails to acknowledge that during the eight-year lifespan of the agreement, North Korea’s nuclear program was dealt significant setbacks. According to Joel Wit, a former State Department negotiator involved in talks on North Korea’s weapons program, 1993 intelligence estimates predicted that within a decade, the rogue country would have enough fissile material to make 75 to 100 nuclear weapons. Despite violations of the agreement, by 2002 North Korea’s nuclear program had been so crippled it could barely produce five nuclear weapons. Today, North Korea faces no international obligations nor inspections -- yet recent studies project that it will take the country until at least 2020 to develop enough fissile material for 100 weapons. “That’s 2020 versus 2003. So we can’t just say, ‘Gee, everything that’s been done with has failed,’” said Wit. “We can’t say we de-nuked North Korea, that’s obvious. But the 1994 agreement did succeed in that it certainly delayed by 20 years the worst possible outcome.”Former Governor of New Mexico Bill Richardson, who has participated in negotiations with North Korea since the collapse of the 1994 agreement, also pushed back on Romney’s comparison. “I don’t buy into the premise that all rogue regimes are the same. This is apples and oranges,” he said, referring to nuclear negotiations between the two countries. While Richardson expressed skepticism about the deal being drafted with Iran, he noted that Muammar Gaddafi’s decision to dismantle Libya’s weapons of mass destruction program proves that “rogue” states are capable of rational negotiations. Unlike North Korea, whose leadership has intentionally isolated the country from the rest of the world, Iran has demonstrated that it wants robust international trade relations and to exert influence in the region. “That gives Iran a great incentive to negotiate a good deal that restores its international status,” said Kelsey Davenport, director for nonproliferation policy at the Arms Control Association. “Iran views the U.N. Security Council sanctions on its country as a stigma -- as an illegal act that they want to see undone. North Korea, on the other hand, often takes pride in being sort of the pariah of the international community. There is much more of an incentive for countries who want to remain part of the global order to negotiate.""Even those that defend the 1994 deal with North Korea as partially successful in curbing its nuclear ambitions admit the deal's ultimate collapse can provide some “lessons learned.” While Romney predicts that the deal with Iran will be weaker than the one reached with North Korea because it does not force the Islamic Republic to dismantle its nuclear facilities, Wit pointed out that the 1994 agreement had far fewer inspections requirements than what is expected to be included in the final deal with Iran. Partially in response to the collapse of the North Korean agreement, the U.N. nuclear watchdog, known as the International Atomic Energy Agency, has drafted an additional protocol to the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons Treaty requiring member states to allow inspectors comprehensive access to their nuclear facilities. Iran, already party to the NPT, is expected to ratify the additional protocol as part of a final nuclear deal. Unlike other components of the deal, Iran’s requirements under the additional protocol are permanent. “This means that even after the limits on Iran’s nuclear program expire, monitoring and inspections regimes will remain in place,” said Davenport. “The additional protocol was designed to give inspectors extra tools that ensure no covert nuclear activities are taking place.” "

Legal junkies and feminist disciples alike have long admired the Justice's badassery since she took her seat in the court in 1993. But it was her scathing dissent of the Supreme Court's decision to allow private businesses to refuse certain forms of birth control coverage to their employees that launched her OG status into public consciousness. From the only slightly ironic Notorious R.B.G. meme to musical remixes of her dissents, pop culture reverence of the Supreme Court veteran seems here to stay. Ginsburg turns 82 on March 15. In response to the question of whether she has considered stepping down, she has said: ""As long as I can do the job full steam. I think I'll recognize when the time comes that I can't any longer. But now I can."" In other words, she's literally too legit to quit.On R.B.G.'s birthday, we honor her 21 years on the Supreme Court and 82 years of general badassery with just a few notable quotes showing just how brightly that candlepower burns.

Four years ago, the then CEO of the Tennessee Hospitality Association, Walt Baker, took much heat and lost a lot of business for his marketing firm when he also likened the First Lady to a monkey. Four years later, a Belgian newspaper, De Morgen, went one, in fact, two better. Before Obama's visit to the Netherlands in March 2014, it ran a Photoshop picture that depicted both Michelle and President Obama as apes. De Morgen was not just your run of the mill far right, shrill racially xenophobic European newspaper. It purported to be a progressive newspaper. Yet, despite its alleged politically enlightened stance, it apparently saw no contradiction in its ape imagery of the president and Michelle. In February 2009, New York Post cartoonist Sean Delonas ignited a firestorm with his casual depiction of President Obama as a monkey.In the nearly five years between Baker and Figueroa's idiotic pop-offs, with De Morgen sandwiched in between, the depiction, pillorying and vile spoofery of the Obamas as apes, monkeys and gorillas in the pack of race baiting websites, chat rooms, college frat parties, and student websites in assorted offbeat, crude, vile cartoons has become standard fare. That's not an accident. The long, sordid and savage history of racist stereotyping of African-Americans has been the stock in trade of race baiting and racial ridicule for more than century. A few grotesque book titles from a century ago, such as The Negro, a Beast; The Negro, a Menace to American Civilization; and The Clansman depicted blacks as apes, monkeys, bestial, and animal-like. The image stuck in books, magazines, journals, and deeply colored the thinking of many Americans of that day... that day?In the movie version of Rudyard Kipling children's classic, The Jungle Book, the Disney Studios in 1967 graduated from the other standard animal depiction of African-Americans as black crows to depicting African-Americans as the monkey like jive, gibberish blathering King Louie. The film was remade in 1994.Black personalities and notables have been special targets of the ape and monkey taunts and digs. Jackie Robinson was regularly taunted by opponents with monkey gestures and gibes. Black basketball greats Patrick Ewing and Michael Jordan were ridiculed in cartoons as apes. And it's become a virtual ritual for white fans to toss banana peels at black soccer players in Europe The vile ape characterization of blacks is much more than a passing fancy of cranks, haters and unreconstructed bigots. In 2007, Penn State researchers conducted six separate studies and found that many Americans still link blacks with apes and monkeys. Many of them were young and had absolutely no knowledge of the vicious stereotyping of blacks of years past. Their findings with the provocative title ""Not Yet Human: Implicit Knowledge, Historical Dehumanization and Contemporary Consequences,"" in the February 2008 issue of Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, was published by the American Psychological Association.The overwhelming majority of the participants in the studies bristled at the faintest hint that they had any racial bias. But the animal savagery image and blacks was very much on their minds. The researchers found that participants -- and that included even those with no stated prejudices or knowledge of the historical images -- were quicker to associate blacks with apes than they were to associate whites with apes.This was not simply a dry academic exercise. The animal association and blacks has had devastating real life consequences. In hundreds of news stories from 1979 to 1999 the Philadelphia Inquirer was much more likely to describe African Americans than Whites convicted of capital crimes with ape-relevant language, such as ""barbaric,"" ""beast,"" ""brute,"" ""savage"" and ""wild."" And jurors in criminal cases were far more likely to judge blacks more harshly than whites, and regard them and their crimes as savage, bestial and heinous, and slap them with tougher sentences than whites.First Lady Michelle Obama is a woman, a black woman, and has been a repeated soft target for the frustrations and even scorn of the Obama loathers. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Obama opponents eagerly latched onto out-of-context statement she made at a campaign rally in which she allegedly questioned her faith in America, and made a supposedly less than reverential reference to the flag. They brutally tarred her as a closet anti-American, race-obsessed, black radical. That made her an instant campaign liability. For weeks, she virtually disappeared from the campaign trail.During her years in the White House, Michelle's public acclaim and notoriety as a popular and much admired and respected First Lady has grown. This is too much for some. Figueroa was the latest to show that. In the process, he again showed there is nothing new in the ape slur of a president and his wife.--Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

Tsarnaev is charged with the April 2013 attack that killed three people and injured more than 260. He could face the death penalty if convicted. (AP Photo/Jane Flavell Collins)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2c3992400005000546943.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Scott MaloneBOSTON, March 15 (Reuters) - A question looms over the trial of accused Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as federal prosecutors enter the final stages of their case against him: Will he testify in his own defense?Tsarnaev's lawyers opened the trial this month with a blunt admission, saying he helped his older brother carry out the twin bombings that killed three people and injured 264 near the renowned race's finish line on April 15, 2013.Rather than fighting to prove his innocence, defense attorneys hope to spare the ethnic Chechen from execution by persuading the jury he played a secondary role to Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, who masterminded the attacks and was killed after a gunfight with police later that week.That strategy has led the defense to hang back through the first six days of the trial, allowing prosecutors to sail through 51 witnesses, including people injured by the blasts and first responders who attended to them.When the trial resumes in U.S. District Court in Boston on Monday, prosecutors will move on to the final hours before Tsarnaev was found hiding in a drydocked boat.After they conclude their case, it will be up to defense attorneys to determine whether to call Tsarnaev, 21, to testify. He could do so either before the jury reaches a verdict or during the sentencing phase of the trial, when jurors would determine whether to sentence him to death or life in prison.""The prosecution is going to try to demonize him, so the defense has to try to humanize him,"" said James Acker, death penalty specialist and professor at the State University of New York in Albany. ""It would be very hard to do that effectively without putting Tsarnaev on the witness stand.""The most aggressive cross-examination defense attorneys have undertaken so far in this trial came last week when FBI agent Stephen Kimball testified about two Twitter accounts Tsarnaev maintained, where he sent messages including ""I will die young"" and a joke about the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.Rejecting those messages as evidence of murderous intent, defense attorney Miriam Conrad pointed out that the first was a line from a Russian rap song, while the second was taken from a cable comedy program. SINCERITY KEYIf Tsarnaev testifies and comes across as sincerely sorry for the deaths and gruesome injuries suffered by the bombing victims, that could soften the hearts of the 12 jurors and six alternates who will decide his fate, legal experts said.""A death sentence is less likely to be imposed if the defendant testifies and is remorseful,"" said William Bowers, who conducted the Capital Jury Project, which polled about 1,200 jurors who sat on death penalty trials during the 1990s.Putting Tsarnaev on the witness stand would also carry a risk, however, since it is not clear what he might say or whether he would respond angrily under questioning, experts said.""He's going to undoubtedly want to testify so he can get his message out and the messages is that he committed these crimes in the name of Allah,"" said Boston defense attorney Geoffrey Nathan, who is not involved in the case.The jury this week viewed a note that prosecutors say Tsarnaev wrote on the hull of the boat where he was found hiding, suggesting the attack was an act of retribution for U.S. military campaigns in Muslim-dominated countries.""I can't stand to see such evil go unpunished,"" the note read. ""We Muslims are one body, you hurt one you hurt us all.""Tsarnaev has not spoken during the proceedings, sitting quietly with his lawyers, who may still be deciding whether to put him on the stand, said Robert Bloom, a professor of law at Boston College.""It's his counsel's call and that call is based on what kind of impression he would make to the jurors,"" Bloom said. ""It's a risky move, no matter how you cut it."" (Reporting by Scott Malone; Editing by Tom Brown)"

For these reasons, I will not lecture at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the spring of 2015.",2015-03-15,A beautiful fall day on the quad of the Univsersity of Illinois in Champaign. The Student Union is in the background.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae5698250000cf0037c461.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nearly a year ago, I agreed to give two talks this spring at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign -- a Chancellor's Lecture and a keynote address to the Women Faculty of Color in the Academy Conference. At the time I agreed to speak, Dr. Steven Salaita was in a dispute with the university over his tweets which Chancellor Phyllis Wise said ""demonstrate that Dr. Salaita lacks the judgment, temperament and thoughtfulness to serve as a member of the [UIUC] faculty."" Recently, Salaita filed a lawsuit alleging that the university breached a contract to employ him and violated his rights to freedom of speech. This legal action has dramatically reshaped the conversational space on campus and erodes the possibility of the open conversation I had hoped to have during my talks there. In light of the changed environment, I will not speak at UIUC this spring. I am disappointed because I planned to share what I had learned from time spent engaging in robust discussions on college campuses across the country on Title IX and the protection of all students' rights to educational equality, specifically, protection against verbal sexual harassment and physical sexual assault. In my lectures, I argued that development of effective Title IX policies and procedures demands full consideration of the college-community context and deep understanding of perspectives from the most vulnerable individuals on campus, even before they become victims of harassment or assault. In settings, ranging from small liberal arts colleges to large research universities, I touted comprehensive conversations with inquiry, as Michelle Fine has ably summarized, ""shaped by those who have paid the greatest price for injustice"" (Fine 2011) as best academy practices, as well as models for greater public understanding. University administrators (including presidents, chancellors, and provosts), faculty and students have attended these sessions in the spirit of candid discussion aimed at problem solving. During the fall, as negotiations between UIUC and Professor Salaita broke down and a boycott of the university grew, I began crafting my University of Illinois lectures to address the tensions between the protections of civil rights laws aimed at providing equal educational opportunity, on the one hand, and freedom of speech, on the other. My position is that the clash between the university and Dr. Salaita reflects a tension between two values: The prohibition against language that furthers a hostile environment and freedom of expression. Both of these values can seek to promote inclusivity. I naively thought that a fruitful conversation on the campus of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign could lead to reconciliation based on the shared interest behind both, even with the Salaita affair as a backdrop. I have concluded that the productive discussion I envisioned cannot occur in the shadow of active litigation and the resulting present intense polarity. For these reasons, I will not lecture at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the spring of 2015. Court cases are the ultimate ""winner-take-all"" affairs with the primary objective of resolving the dispute between the two parties, not attending to the needs of all members in the community. By necessity, both sides in litigation harden their positions, lest they give away something that might be used against them in legal proceedings. The lawsuit shrinks and infects the conversational environment available to those on campus, especially university administrators, seeking the production and dissemination of knowledge that extends to issues that go beyond the immediate dispute. While a court of law may be exactly the correct and only place to resolve the conflict between Dr. Salaita and UIUC, the litigation completely alters the context for any talk I can give.I deeply regret the missed opportunities to address the entire campus and the women faculty of color and, especially, to hear from those voices in the words of Toni Morrison, ""routinely ignored or played down or unknown."" Whether I am present or not, there will come a time for the UIUC community to wrestle with the ongoing question writ large of how to protect both basic civil rights and freedom of expression. The most recent example of this clash is University of Oklahoma President David Boren quick reaction to the video of a Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternity's racist, celebratory chant that included references to African Americans being lynched. Citing freedom of speech, Boren's critics were equally swift to condemn his decision to close the chapter and expel two of its members. Nevertheless, with the campus reeling from this episode, President Boren's rapid response is no substitute for deep inquiry into and community reckoning with the racial climate on the Norman, Oklahoma campus that students have complained about for some time. The myriad expression versus hostile environment conflicts that have surfaced in colleges and universities across the country should remind us that these issues are not going away. But they also suggest to me that the academy has an obligation and an opportunity to model the work that is to be done as the public at large grapples with these questions."

Short of the State Department finding some grenade of an email, the release of some 55,000 Clinton emails from the government archives is more likely to reinforce Clinton's formidable leadership and executive abilities than subtract from her decades-old image of an American Iron Lady.Republicans will wail at her desire for privacy in not turning over her personal emails, but look at America's angst on this very topic. Many citizens feel that our privacy has been compromised, by everyone from the government to Russian hackers; that our private stuff is under threat. Hard to imagine that the citizenry will begrudge Clinton's desire for some modicum of privacy even as her official emails are published on a State Department website.The Washington press corps has been foaming at the mouth, an expected reaction. At a recent networking event of political reporters, one 2016 campaign beat journalist, writing for a major national paper, was almost salivating. ""It's just like the Clintons!"" he cried. ""So typical! This is huge!""This would be his meal ticket for the next few weeks, and I could not help but feel happy for him. Washington journalists need scandal to thrive. The routine reporting of the minor personalities who haunt the halls of Congress or of obscure second-rank Cabinet secretaries makes for poor copy.And while the Benghazi Brigade in the GOP is still marching along in the desert, hoping to stumble on to a smoking gun, their political shenanigans in not releasing the voluminous collection of Clinton's email that they possess will only further tarnish their credibility. And there is no polling that I've seen that shows that Benghazi is even a remotely relevant issue for the non-Tea Party majority of the electorate.It's no wonder, then, that the 2016 GOP pre-candidates have stayed largely silent on the Clinton email brouhaha. First, you can bet that more than one of those candidates has used multiple email accounts themselves while in office. The widespread ownership of email glass houses makes it awkward, if not outright dangerous, for these candidates to throw rocks at Clinton. In fact, former Governor Jeb Bush was quite loquacious with his private email account -- even using it to discuss security issues and troop deployments. Second, if any of these candidates think that Clinton's email flap will both endure and be a factor in 2016, they are getting bad advice. As nonpartisan Charlie Cook in National Journal pointed out, there are much more real, politically relevant and resonant issues that will either result in Clinton presidency or an upset.Clinton has a built-in advantage -- her gender. It now looks that she will use the glass-ceiling theme to connect with millions of people who think that the disparities in opportunity, income and talent-based achievement between men and women is not only unfair, but damaging to all women, two-income families and the economy in general.Some percentage of Americans, likely a large one, would like to cast a historic vote. When polling points to Americans wanting ""change,"" what bigger change than a woman as president?Clinton is white. Yes, President Obama was elected twice, with millions of votes over the 50 percent victory threshold. But looking at the election data that show a precipitous drop in his support among white voters, relative to past Democratic candidates, one can infer some racial bias in a sliver of the electorate. Clinton might be able to attract those voters simply because she is not an African-American man.In terms of the Latino vote, even though many Republicans are counting on him, Sen. Marco Rubio's (Fla.) craven flip-flopping is not likely to endear him to many Hispanics outside of Miami. Conversely, Clinton is hugely popular among Hispanics, as is her husband. She's been a steadfast supporter of immigrant rights and was Latino voters' favorite during the 2008 primaries. She will sweep the Hispanic vote.Lastly, the first couple of months of Republican congressional hegemony has been an exercise in immigrant-baiting. Republicans seem to have a visceral need to attack undocumented immigrants. It's an article of faith among the majority of Republicans who voted in both chambers of Congress several times that Obama's immigration actions must be destroyed -- even if young people like the Dreamers are deported. In a recent Latino Decisions poll, 89 percent of American Latinos favored Obama's executive actions.I learned my lesson about predictions when I projected former Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) as the 2012 GOP nominee. But in this case, short of a deus ex machina event, it's a good bet that Hillary Clinton will next occupy the White House."

What could have been an innocuous scheduling change drew attention after an anonymous source from the Kazakh government told Reuters it was due to illness. Observers raised more red flags after Putin skipped an annual meeting with the Federal Security Service the next day.These missed meetings sparked the online rumor mill, and soon the hashtags #ПутинУмер (Putin is dead) and #WhereIsPutin were trending on Twitter, reports Reuters.

Portman says he will wait until after the midterm elections to decide whether to mount a presidential run or to focus on winning a second Senate term in 2016. (AP Photo/Al Behrman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ed8f2500008e013a5b13.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In recent public polling from Ohio, a consistent truth about the state's junior senator, Rob Portman, is that much of the electorate simply doesn't have a sense of who he is.This past week offered voters noteworthy examples of how Rob Portman sees the world -- and they demonstrate unimpressive judgment:During events commemorating the 50th anniversary of the March in Selma, Alabama, Portman said that restoring key provisions to the Voting Rights Act following the Supreme Court's 2013 gutting of core pieces of the historic legislation was a mere matter of making ""tweaks."" Moreover, Portman admitted to not even being aware of existing Senate legislation to make these crucial restorations. Next, only days later, Portman signed on to a widely-criticized letter by freshman senator and Tea Party darling, Tom Cotton, undermining his own government in its negotiations with Iran and compromising our national security.Rob Portman likes to project the image of someone who thinks carefully about the issues. Yet, these two recent examples make one wonder what exactly he was thinking. To be clear, I have nothing against Rob Portman as a person. But there is a stark difference in our visions for Ohio and for our country. I believe that the United States is strongest at home when we support everyone's ability to speak up and speak out: A central part of that is guaranteeing that all Americans are able to vote without encountering unnecessary obstacles along the way.Further, I believe that the United States is strongest on the international stage when politics ends at the water's edge and we don't compromise national security interests with blatantly political actions.   Photo-ops and grandstanding do not translate into leadership. For Rob Portman to attend the celebration commemorating the bravery of civil rights leaders who marched across the Edmund Pettus Bridge, and tell reporters that: ""This day is about more than just tweaks to the Voting Rights Act,"" shows a senator who is deeply out-of-touch. This is the same man who also voted against the National Voter Registration Act. The Supreme Court's 2013 ruling eroded much of what was at the core of the Voting Rights Act, leaving states with histories of voter discrimination free to erect new hurdles to the ballot box. Indeed, Portman has supported reducing ballot access in his home state of Ohio.Portman said he is interested in ""learning from the lessons of the past,"" but later conveyed: ""That he doesn't know if parts of it [the Voting Rights Act] need to be strengthened.""Senator, they do -- urgently. The reach of Rob Portman's bad week went well beyond his startling comments in Selma. Actions matters more than words, and while Portman wishes to come across as measured, his decision to be among the 47 Republican senators who sent a letter to the leaders of Iran undermining the current diplomatic process was irresponsible at best and dangerous at worst.Without question, Iran's nuclear program is a serious threat which must be handled firmly. But Portman's impulse to first play politics is not the way. The Cincinnati Enquirer didn't mince words to their hometown senator, saying: ""Portman's decision to sign the letter to Iran was a mistake.""  In the course of the current election cycle, Ohioans will get to know Rob Portman better, and it will become increasingly apparent that his decision-making is short-sighted and out-of-touch. As I travel the state talking with families and students and seniors, it's clear they want new leadership and a fresh approach to solving problems. Ohioans can't afford more of Rob Portman's poor judgment. They deserve new representation which puts people, not politics, first."

To the best of my knowledge this was the first time that the United States had responded to a terrorist attack on a close ally with a musical performance. The French found the whole response perplexing. Many Americans were embarrassed.Initially, I admit, I was less than thrilled by the White House's response. With the benefit of hindsight, I've come to conclude that the issue was not the nature of the response, but rather the choice of artist and repertoire. Don't get me wrong -- I like James Taylor and his music. He reminds me of college and misspent youth. But given the gravity of the situation, I think we should have responded with one of our ""big guns."" I would have sent Kenny Rogers.On the way back from Paris, Kenny could have stopped in Washington and swung by the White House to host a seminar on foreign policy. What would Kenny Rogers, quintessential American country music star and budding theorist of international politics have advised the foreign policy minions at the White House? I'm so glad you asked. No doubt he would have told them... ""You've got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away, and know when to run."" Pity he didn't have the chance. Kenny Rogers Portraying ""The Gambler.""Fifteen years of American foreign policy in Iraq has been an unmitigated disaster. It is a failure that cuts across the usual political divide of Democrats versus Republicans, Liberals versus Conservatives or Progressives versus whatever. In retrospect, we would have been far better off leaving Saddam Hussein in place. Not because in the end he had any redeeming features -- he did not -- but because, from the standpoint of American interests in the area, everything that has followed has been worse. It's hard to know what is the most laughable: the neocon, cold war retreads, who, having watched one to many World War II flicks, genuinely thought that American troops entering Baghdad would be greeted by cheering throngs of Iraqis, or those uber-cool, detached, unemotional 21st century pragmatists who honestly believed they would be cheered by those same throngs when they left. Neither happened. Whatever cheering Iraqi politicians did was limited to Uncle Sam's checkbook. It garnered standing room only crowds of admirers, and thunderous applause every time it was flipped open.Critics on both the left and the right have been quick to excoriate the other side. Republican stupidity, Democratic naiveté, international oil, not to mention that ""vast right wing conspiracy"" or its half-brother, the ""great left wing conspiracy,"" plus a half-century of misguided Middle East foreign policy have all figured prominently in those denunciations. In reality, history is too complex a phenomenon to reduce to the consequences of one independent variable. Invariably it is the result of the interaction of multiple variables whose complex and often unanticipated results are as much shaped by good intentions and devious intent as they are by their unintended consequences. It may be emotionally satisfying to point to a single cause and proclaim a self-satisfying ""got you,"" but to do so is intellectually dishonest and historically inaccurate.The American intervention in Iraq was prompted by the belief that Hussein had developed a vast arsenal of chemical weapons of mass destruction (plausible given the fact that he had used chemical weapons during the war with Iran and against Shia rebels in the south and Kurdish rebels in the north); that he was developing atomic weapons and was, according to one report, possibly only weeks away from having useable atomic bombs (laughable to the extreme, only the suggestion that he had obtained such weapons from the tooth fairy would have been any more farfetched); that he was developing biological weapons (plausible that he was dabbling into such weapons, but not a shred of evidence that they were even remotely close to weaponizing any such research); and purported links to al-Qaeda (also plausible, but given the disdain that bin-Laden had for the Ba'ath party and ""secular Arab socialists,"" also highly unlikely). I will leave it to future historians to decide whether the invasion of Iraq in 2003 represented a colossal failure of intelligence or an example of an exercise in a mass, hysterical self-deception at the highest levels of the American and British governments. Iranian Soldier During Iraqi Chemical Weapon Attack, Iran-Iraq War 1980-1988The consequences of that invasion are well known. The Hussein government was overthrown and replaced with a Shiite-dominated government. Iraq was wracked by a Shiite-Sunni civil war fueled by militant Sunni Salafist organizations directed initially at both American and coalition military forces and the Shiite government and its police and military forces, and later especially against Iraq's Shiite civilian population as well. Despite a brief interlude of relative peace from 2010 to 2012, violence between Iraq's Shia and Sunni communities erupted again leading to the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and eventually its evolution into the organization known as Islamic State (IS).Over the course of 2014, ISIL and then IS took control of most of western Iraq, and the majority of the population centers in the region known as the Sunni Triangle, in central Iraq. Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, although not technically in the Sunni Triangle, was also taken. At one point, in late summer, it looked as if the city of Baghdad itself would fall to IS militants. Only the intervention of American air power and Iranian Revolutionary Guard and Quds force units and the mobilization of Shiite militias stemmed the onslaught from Islamic State. To be clear, the conquest of Baghdad would have been no easy matter and it was by no means inevitable. Nonetheless, the combination of airpower and additional ground forces stopped the Islamic State's further advance eastward.The United States now finds itself in a difficult dilemma. American airpower can punish Islamic State. It can erode its military capabilities, strike at its concentrations of men and materials, and help to halt its further advance. Without boots on the ground, however, air power alone is insufficient to roll back the territorial conquests of Islamic State. Having pulled American troops out of Iraq, despite the warnings of many of its own military advisors that such an action was premature, the White House now finds it politically suicidal to reintroduce large numbers of American ground troops to active combat in Iraq, so that they can refight the same battles for the same cities that American soldiers died for once before to stabilize Iraq a decade ago. Islamic State MilitantsInstead, we have quietly forged a de facto alliance with Iran and with its Shiite militia proxies to support the American air intervention and to stiffen the resolve and military effectiveness of the Iraqi Army to resist any further expansion of Islamic State and to begin to roll back its territory. This new cooperation is coming at a time when the White House is seeking to normalize American relations with Iran by trying to reach a ""comprehensive accord on the Iranian nuclear program."" Those negotiations are primarily occurring in the context of ongoing negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 committee, a United Nations Security Council sanctioned group consisting of the United States, Russia, China, France, United Kingdom, and Germany. The first five are all permanent members of the UN Security Council, Germany is currently a member but not a permanent one, hence the P5+1 designation. In addition, there are also ongoing discussions between representatives of the U.S. and Iranian governments. A successful conclusion to the negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 would result in the ending of sanctions against Tehran and hasten the process of reconciliation between Washington and Tehran.Many of America's European allies, as well as its traditional allies in the Middle East, including such disparate allies as Israel and Saudi Arabia, have expressed concern that in its desire to normalize relations with Tehran, Washington will accede to the eventual acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran and to the Iranian government's agenda of political Shiism. That agenda is seen as destabilizing to the Middle East in general and to the Gulf States in particular. The overthrow of the Hussein government has already eliminated an existential threat to Iran resulting in its emergence as the principal regional power in the Persian Gulf and in the creation of a broad arc of Iranian influence that runs across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon to Gaza and which, with the success of the Houthi rebellion in Yemen, now has an important outpost on the other side of the Arabian peninsula. Moreover, it is hard to put aside the concern that the White House's determination to reach an agreement with Iran is driven in part by a desire to beef up an otherwise dismal foreign policy résumé. The Obama administration has little to show for six years of foreign policy. The reset with Russia proved to be a short circuit. To be clear, Russian aggression against its neighbors has been the primary cause for the steady deterioration of U.S.-Russian relations, but initial American ambivalence in the face of Russian aggression against its smaller neighbors was also a contributing factor. Vagueness and ambivalence have a role to play in the conduct of diplomacy but in the face of aggression they often times serve to encourage and validate ""bad behavior."" That was the lesson of Munich and the desperate attempt to secure ""peace in our time."" It is a lesson that the West continues to forget at its peril. It is a lesson whose refresher course is often paid for with blood and capital. The fact is that the nations of Eastern Europe are more uncertain about their future today than at any time since the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939.  Putin and Obama Confer During G20 Meeting in St. Petersburg, September 5-6, 2013.Likewise, the pivot to Asia proved to be a pivot to nowhere. To be fair, the United States did obtain a commitment from China to reduce its carbon emissions. Does that mean that the Chinese navy will be in the market to buy carbon credits to offset its expanded deployment in the South and East China Seas? Will the lasting legacy of ""the pivot"" be the 21st century concept of ""carbon neutral hegemony?"" No doubt China's neighbors will gain solace from the realization that the expansion of Chinese military power on East Asia will be accomplished without an appreciable increase in carbon pollution.  China's 1st Aircraft CarrierWhen it comes to the Middle East, the Obama administration presents a veritable smorgasbord of policy disasters. Where does one start? Let's see, there was the overthrow of the Gaddafi regime where the White House pioneered the concept of ""leading from behind"" or was that ""leading with their behind?"" Bear with me, all of this 21st century ""cool hand Luke,"" detached, unemotional uber pragmatism is a little hard for me to keep straight sometimes. Then there was the infamous red line we drew in the sand in Syria when we warned Assad against the use of chemical weapons against the militants looking to overthrow his regime. He crossed it with impunity. The White House forgot where they had drawn it and conveniently erased it. Rule number one at the Obama White House: When writing down key principals of U.S. foreign policy be sure to always use a pencil -- easier to erase that way.  Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq, Iranian Backed Shia Militia GroupLet's not forget the ongoing and very public spat with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. I'm not a big fan of Netanyahu. I think that his policy of continuing to build Israeli settlements in the West Bank is ultimately further destabilizing the region and makes a realistic Israeli-Palestinian peace accord that much more difficult to reach. Subjecting the democratically elected leader of a small state to petty humiliations is beneath the dignity of a great power, however, and it demeans the office of the presidency regardless of the political affiliation of the person who holds it. For all our faults, we are, and should be, better than this.To his credit, President Obama did win the Nobel ""We're So Glad You're Not George W. Bush"" Peace Prize for... well for not being George Bush, I guess. That's an accomplishment he shares with 350 million other Americans. Since George W. is constitutionally barred from ever running for president again, future American presidents should have a lock on this prestigious prize. Not sure if Jeb Bush would qualify. He isn't George W. after all; still the Nobel Peace Prize Committee might find it traumatizing to give it to him. He may have to settle for an honorable mention. Last, but not least, there was the recent opening to Havana. A fresh new approach to our relations with Cuba and an end to a half-century of myopic ""containment."" That seems to be going nowhere also as the Castro brothers have concluded that Washington needs good relations with Havana more than Havana needs them with Washington. They have an impressive list, starting with the turnover of the Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay and a demand for reparations for the damage that the American embargo inflicted on Cuba as a prerequisite to restoring relations. Honestly, you can't make this stuff up. Don't hold your breath on a breakthrough with Cuba anytime soon, not unless the White House does something really shortsighted.If President Obama were still a student at Harvard Law and U.S. Foreign Policy a required class he would, at best, be facing an Incomplete and at worse an F. Bye-bye, Law Review. As that noted strategist of international politics, Kenny Rogers, has observed, ""That the secret to survivin' is knowin' what to throw away and knowin' what to keep."" Let's face the facts in Iraq. The Baghdad government is steadily slipping into Tehran's orbit. Given the long standing ties between Iraq's Shiite politicians and Tehran that outcome was probably inevitable. No one is responsible for ""losing"" Iraq because we never ""had it"" in the first place. What support and influence we do have seems contingent on our willingness to open our checkbook. Why is the United States paying to train an army for a government that seems completely unappreciative of the American lives and capital that have been expended on its behalf, and that at the same time exports four million barrels of crude oil each and every single day? First of all we have other cards to play in Iraq. The Kurds desperately need American support both in their fight with Islamic State and political support to allow the export of Kurdish crude oil without being dependent on the Baghdad controlled Iraq National Oil Company. We should supply Kurdish Peshmerga forces with the heavy weapons they have requested and which, in deference to the Baghdad government, we have declined to send. We should also end American opposition to the direct export of Kurdish controlled petroleum. We should also support Kurdish efforts for greater autonomy and eventually for an independent Kurdish state. Such a state would be a key American ally in the region and an important deterrent to the continued expansion of Iranian influence in the area.Kurdish Peshmerga ForcesLikewise, notwithstanding the often tense and historically strained relations between the United States and Iraq's Sunni community, the fact is that the United States is the Sunni community's best hope for a lasting peace and a fairer treatment either as a largely autonomous state within a federated union or itself as an independent state. We've worked successfully with the Sunni tribal chiefs before. We can do it again.Iran's nuclear agenda, regardless of whether it ever leads to the development and deployment of nuclear weapons, and its program of political Shiism is ultimately as destabilizing to the Middle East as Salafist inspired jihadist violence. Notwithstanding Tehran's willingness, or so it claims, to slow down key elements of its nuclear program and allow unfettered inspections of its nuclear facilities, it has shown no willingness to end or minimize its Shiite political agenda. Rather than accommodating that agenda and eliminating the sanctions against Iran in return for a promise of stretching out its nuclear development program and helping the Baghdad government in its fight with Islamic State, we should do the opposite. Baghdad is a lost cause. It was a bad hand and we made things worse by insisting on playing it and continuing to insist on staying at the table. As old poker hands are fond of pointing out, if you haven't figured out who the mark at the table is in the first five minutes, then you're the mark. Time to fold that hand and move on. Leave it to history to determine who to partition blame to. We don't have that luxury.On that same front we need to bring a meaningful military effort in support of the Free Syrian Army (FSA) rebels attempting to overthrow the Assad regime. Rather than accepting the inevitability that, as the Syrian government recently reminded us, ""Assad is here to stay,"" we need to do whatever we can to insure that the FSA succeeds in overthrowing the Iranian proxy government in Damascus. It's their fight. We can't win it for them, but there is a lot more support we can bring to bear. During the military intervention over Kosovo, also restricted to just the deployment of air power, the United States flew more sorties in a day then we fly over Syria in a week. Iranian Missile TestThis is not the time to end the sanctions against Iran; not as long as a key element of Tehran's government policy is the export of Shiite political activism and revolution to its Middle East neighbors. At the same time, it goes without saying that the Sunni Arab regimes in the region need to integrate their Shia subjects into the political and economic life of their respective countries or Iranian financed, trained, and inspired Shia militias will do it for them. Diplomacy is about nuance. It's about navigating across a myriad of shades of gray where right and wrong or not always readily apparent or well defined. Sometimes, in trying to distinguish across those nuances we lose sight of the forest from the trees. At the risk of oversimplification, sometimes we just need to focus on the overriding big picture rather than all of the extenuating circumstances. In this case the big picture is clear. Containing Iran's agenda of political Shiism is just as crucial as containing Salafist jihadist violence. Accepting that agenda as the price for Iranian support in Iraq is a bad trade. As Kenny Rogers so succinctly put it you've got to ""Know when to fold 'em."""

To the best of my knowledge this was the first time that the United States had responded to a terrorist attack on a close ally with a musical performance. The French found the whole response perplexing. Many Americans were embarrassed.Initially, I admit, I was less than thrilled by the White House's response. With the benefit of hindsight, I've come to conclude that the issue was not the nature of the response, but rather the choice of artist and repertoire. Don't get me wrong -- I like James Taylor and his music. He reminds me of college and misspent youth. But given the gravity of the situation, I think we should have responded with one of our ""big guns."" I would have sent Kenny Rogers.On the way back from Paris, Kenny could have stopped in Washington and swung by the White House to host a seminar on foreign policy. What would Kenny Rogers, quintessential American country music star and budding theorist of international politics have advised the foreign policy minions at the White House? I'm so glad you asked. No doubt he would have told them... ""You've got to know when to hold 'em, know when to fold 'em, know when to walk away, and know when to run."" Pity he didn't have the chance. Kenny Rogers Portraying ""The Gambler.""Fifteen years of American foreign policy in Iraq has been an unmitigated disaster. It is a failure that cuts across the usual political divide of Democrats versus Republicans, Liberals versus Conservatives or Progressives versus whatever. In retrospect, we would have been far better off leaving Saddam Hussein in place. Not because in the end he had any redeeming features -- he did not -- but because, from the standpoint of American interests in the area, everything that has followed has been worse. It's hard to know what is the most laughable: the neocon, cold war retreads, who, having watched one to many World War II flicks, genuinely thought that American troops entering Baghdad would be greeted by cheering throngs of Iraqis, or those uber-cool, detached, unemotional 21st century pragmatists who honestly believed they would be cheered by those same throngs when they left. Neither happened. Whatever cheering Iraqi politicians did was limited to Uncle Sam's checkbook. It garnered standing room only crowds of admirers, and thunderous applause every time it was flipped open.Critics on both the left and the right have been quick to excoriate the other side. Republican stupidity, Democratic naiveté, international oil, not to mention that ""vast right wing conspiracy"" or its half-brother, the ""great left wing conspiracy,"" plus a half-century of misguided Middle East foreign policy have all figured prominently in those denunciations. In reality, history is too complex a phenomenon to reduce to the consequences of one independent variable. Invariably it is the result of the interaction of multiple variables whose complex and often unanticipated results are as much shaped by good intentions and devious intent as they are by their unintended consequences. It may be emotionally satisfying to point to a single cause and proclaim a self-satisfying ""got you,"" but to do so is intellectually dishonest and historically inaccurate.The American intervention in Iraq was prompted by the belief that Hussein had developed a vast arsenal of chemical weapons of mass destruction (plausible given the fact that he had used chemical weapons during the war with Iran and against Shia rebels in the south and Kurdish rebels in the north); that he was developing atomic weapons and was, according to one report, possibly only weeks away from having useable atomic bombs (laughable to the extreme, only the suggestion that he had obtained such weapons from the tooth fairy would have been any more farfetched); that he was developing biological weapons (plausible that he was dabbling into such weapons, but not a shred of evidence that they were even remotely close to weaponizing any such research); and purported links to al-Qaeda (also plausible, but given the disdain that bin-Laden had for the Ba'ath party and ""secular Arab socialists,"" also highly unlikely). I will leave it to future historians to decide whether the invasion of Iraq in 2003 represented a colossal failure of intelligence or an example of an exercise in a mass, hysterical self-deception at the highest levels of the American and British governments. Iranian Soldier During Iraqi Chemical Weapon Attack, Iran-Iraq War 1980-1988The consequences of that invasion are well known. The Hussein government was overthrown and replaced with a Shiite-dominated government. Iraq was wracked by a Shiite-Sunni civil war fueled by militant Sunni Salafist organizations directed initially at both American and coalition military forces and the Shiite government and its police and military forces, and later especially against Iraq's Shiite civilian population as well. Despite a brief interlude of relative peace from 2010 to 2012, violence between Iraq's Shia and Sunni communities erupted again leading to the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and eventually its evolution into the organization known as Islamic State (IS).Over the course of 2014, ISIL and then IS took control of most of western Iraq, and the majority of the population centers in the region known as the Sunni Triangle, in central Iraq. Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, although not technically in the Sunni Triangle, was also taken. At one point, in late summer, it looked as if the city of Baghdad itself would fall to IS militants. Only the intervention of American air power and Iranian Revolutionary Guard and Quds force units and the mobilization of Shiite militias stemmed the onslaught from Islamic State. To be clear, the conquest of Baghdad would have been no easy matter and it was by no means inevitable. Nonetheless, the combination of airpower and additional ground forces stopped the Islamic State's further advance eastward.The United States now finds itself in a difficult dilemma. American airpower can punish Islamic State. It can erode its military capabilities, strike at its concentrations of men and materials, and help to halt its further advance. Without boots on the ground, however, air power alone is insufficient to roll back the territorial conquests of Islamic State. Having pulled American troops out of Iraq, despite the warnings of many of its own military advisors that such an action was premature, the White House now finds it politically suicidal to reintroduce large numbers of American ground troops to active combat in Iraq, so that they can refight the same battles for the same cities that American soldiers died for once before to stabilize Iraq a decade ago. Islamic State MilitantsInstead, we have quietly forged a de facto alliance with Iran and with its Shiite militia proxies to support the American air intervention and to stiffen the resolve and military effectiveness of the Iraqi Army to resist any further expansion of Islamic State and to begin to roll back its territory. This new cooperation is coming at a time when the White House is seeking to normalize American relations with Iran by trying to reach a ""comprehensive accord on the Iranian nuclear program."" Those negotiations are primarily occurring in the context of ongoing negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 committee, a United Nations Security Council sanctioned group consisting of the United States, Russia, China, France, United Kingdom, and Germany. The first five are all permanent members of the UN Security Council, Germany is currently a member but not a permanent one, hence the P5+1 designation. In addition, there are also ongoing discussions between representatives of the U.S. and Iranian governments. A successful conclusion to the negotiations between Iran and the P5+1 would result in the ending of sanctions against Tehran and hasten the process of reconciliation between Washington and Tehran.Many of America's European allies, as well as its traditional allies in the Middle East, including such disparate allies as Israel and Saudi Arabia, have expressed concern that in its desire to normalize relations with Tehran, Washington will accede to the eventual acquisition of nuclear weapons by Iran and to the Iranian government's agenda of political Shiism. That agenda is seen as destabilizing to the Middle East in general and to the Gulf States in particular. The overthrow of the Hussein government has already eliminated an existential threat to Iran resulting in its emergence as the principal regional power in the Persian Gulf and in the creation of a broad arc of Iranian influence that runs across Iraq, Syria and Lebanon to Gaza and which, with the success of the Houthi rebellion in Yemen, now has an important outpost on the other side of the Arabian peninsula. Moreover, it is hard to put aside the concern that the White House's determination to reach an agreement with Iran is driven in part by a desire to beef up an otherwise dismal foreign policy résumé. The Obama administration has little to show for six years of foreign policy. The reset with Russia proved to be a short circuit. To be clear, Russian aggression against its neighbors has been the primary cause for the steady deterioration of U.S.-Russian relations, but initial American ambivalence in the face of Russian aggression against its smaller neighbors was also a contributing factor. Vagueness and ambivalence have a role to play in the conduct of diplomacy but in the face of aggression they often times serve to encourage and validate ""bad behavior."" That was the lesson of Munich and the desperate attempt to secure ""peace in our time."" It is a lesson that the West continues to forget at its peril. It is a lesson whose refresher course is often paid for with blood and capital. The fact is that the nations of Eastern Europe are more uncertain about their future today than at any time since the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1939.  Putin and Obama Confer During G20 Meeting in St. Petersburg, September 5-6, 2013.Likewise, the pivot to Asia proved to be a pivot to nowhere. To be fair, the United States did obtain a commitment from China to reduce its carbon emissions. Does that mean that the Chinese navy will be in the market to buy carbon credits to offset its expanded deployment in the South and East China Seas? Will the lasting legacy of ""the pivot"" be the 21st century concept of ""carbon neutral hegemony?"" No doubt China's neighbors will gain solace from the realization that the expansion of Chinese military power on East Asia will be accomplished without an appreciable increase in carbon pollution.  China's 1st Aircraft CarrierWhen it comes to the Middle East, the Obama administration presents a veritable smorgasbord of policy disasters. Where does one start? Let's see, there was the overthrow of the Gaddafi regime where the White House pioneered the concept of ""leading from behind"" or was that ""leading with their behind?"" Bear with me, all of this 21st century ""cool hand Luke,"" detached, unemotional uber pragmatism is a little hard for me to keep straight sometimes. Then there was the infamous red line we drew in the sand in Syria when we warned Assad against the use of chemical weapons against the militants looking to overthrow his regime. He crossed it with impunity. The White House forgot where they had drawn it and conveniently erased it. Rule number one at the Obama White House: When writing down key principals of U.S. foreign policy be sure to always use a pencil -- easier to erase that way.  Asa'ib Ahl al-Haq, Iranian Backed Shia Militia GroupLet's not forget the ongoing and very public spat with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu. I'm not a big fan of Netanyahu. I think that his policy of continuing to build Israeli settlements in the West Bank is ultimately further destabilizing the region and makes a realistic Israeli-Palestinian peace accord that much more difficult to reach. Subjecting the democratically elected leader of a small state to petty humiliations is beneath the dignity of a great power, however, and it demeans the office of the presidency regardless of the political affiliation of the person who holds it. For all our faults, we are, and should be, better than this.To his credit, President Obama did win the Nobel ""We're So Glad You're Not George W. Bush"" Peace Prize for... well for not being George Bush, I guess. That's an accomplishment he shares with 350 million other Americans. Since George W. is constitutionally barred from ever running for president again, future American presidents should have a lock on this prestigious prize. Not sure if Jeb Bush would qualify. He isn't George W. after all; still the Nobel Peace Prize Committee might find it traumatizing to give it to him. He may have to settle for an honorable mention. Last, but not least, there was the recent opening to Havana. A fresh new approach to our relations with Cuba and an end to a half-century of myopic ""containment."" That seems to be going nowhere also as the Castro brothers have concluded that Washington needs good relations with Havana more than Havana needs them with Washington. They have an impressive list, starting with the turnover of the Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay and a demand for reparations for the damage that the American embargo inflicted on Cuba as a prerequisite to restoring relations. Honestly, you can't make this stuff up. Don't hold your breath on a breakthrough with Cuba anytime soon, not unless the White House does something really shortsighted.If President Obama were still a student at Harvard Law and U.S. Foreign Policy a required class he would, at best, be facing an Incomplete and at worse an F. Bye-bye, Law Review. As that noted strategist of international politics, Kenny Rogers, has observed, ""That the secret to survivin' is knowin' what to throw away and knowin' what to keep.""

I hadn't worked in a while,"" Greenfield told The Huffington Post last year. ""I remember that it was quick and easy. Then the way they had cut it together, and with the music they chose, it ended up being a really nice scene. It was one that my mom loved. [...] It was a very big confidence-building moment for me.""But despite the positive memories, Greenfield said he really never had the chance to talk with star Peter Gallagher, who played the adult version of Sandy on the popular teen series.""I met him once, and I was like, 'Hey, man, I played the young you!'"" Greenfield recalled last year. He said Gallagher was a bit flummoxed by the comment. ""I don't think he gave a shit,"" Greenfield joked. ""I suppose if someone played the young me, I probably wouldn't give a fuck either.""But now the two men are co-stars again in Michael Showalter's new film, ""Hello, My Name Is Doris."" The comedy, which stars Greenfield and Sally Field as a pair of unlikely friends, premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival on Saturday night. Gallagher appears briefly as a self-help guru, but does not share the screen with Greenfield.""There was a part of me who thought I should go say hi,"" Greenfield told The Huffington Post on Saturday about seeing Gallagher on the film's set. ""But I'm going to divulge something to you: I got too nervous.""Greenfield said he was sure Gallagher would have been lovely if they had chatted, but his nerves won out. ""I get nervous around very few people. I don't know why, but he's one of them,"" Greenfield said. ""I feel like the only thing I have to say to him is, 'I played the young you.' I think that's a fucking weird way to open up.""Fortunately, Greenfield had no such problem becoming close to Showalter. The pair grew friendly while filming David Wain's ""They Came Together,"" which Showalter co-wrote. ""I think I became a secondary assistant to him,"" Greenfield said. ""At one point, I was cleaning his phone.""While the ""New Girl"" star was filming the drama ""About Alex"" in 2013, he was offered the co-leading role in ""Hello, My Name Is Doris."" But it was almost a full year before the film would begin shooting. ""It was cool when it started coming together with all the different actors,"" Greenfield said. Cast members include Beth Behrs, Rich Sommer, Natasha Lyonne, Tyne Daly and ""Bleachers"" lead singer Jack Antonoff. Field, whom Showalter had held up as an ideal version of Doris, came aboard as well. It's the actress' first leading role in a film in almost 20 years.""I've worked with a lot of people, but Sally is definitely on a different level,"" Greenfield said of his Oscar-winning co-star. ""But I knew that if I treated her as such, it was going to fuck me. I have to do scenes with her, and I can't be fanning out or so precious around her."" The onscreen relationship between Field and Greenfield spurs a coming-of-age for Field's Doris, an office worker struggling to cope with life after the death of her mother. As Field said after the film's premiere on Saturday night, Showalter balances heavy dramatic moments with ridiculous screwball comedy in a way that feels fresh and almost subversive. ""We had a lot of fun,"" Greenfield said of his time with Field. ""I think we walked away from this with a nice friend.""Now if she can only introduce him to Peter Gallagher.""Hello, My Name Is Doris"" does not yet have distribution.

Kahlon, who in November 2014 announced a comeback, is at the head of a new centre-right party called 'Kulanu' (All Of Us). AFP PHOTO / GALI TIBBON (Photo credit should read GALI TIBBON/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14722240000030a51b80c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"JERUSALEM, March 15 (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, trailing in opinion polls two days before a parliamentary election, publicly offered on Sunday the Finance Ministry portfolio to a potentially king-making rival.Facing possible upset defeat in the March 17 vote, Netanyahu has launched a media blitz to counter what appears to be a rising tide of support for his main opponent, the center-left Zionist Union.Moshe Kahlon, a former member of Netanyahu's Likud party whose newly formed centrist party could be a deciding factor in who becomes prime minister, dismissed the offer as pre-election spin.No party has ever won a majority in Israel's 120-seat Knesset, and the party leader with the best chance of forming a majority coalition is tasked with leading the new government.The latest opinion polls predict the Zionist Union taking between 24 and 26 seats in the election, compared with 20-22 seats for Likud.But even if Likud is outnumbered, Netanyahu is counting on a larger right-wing block to support his bid for another term, and Kahlon, with around 10 seats in the polls, could tilt things in his favor.""If I am the one to put together the government, he (Kahlon) will be part of the coalition. Without regard of the number of seats (he wins), he will get the finance portfolio,"" Netanyahu said on Israel Radio.A former communications minister, Kahlon delighted Israelis by promoting competition in the cellular market, a move that slashed the prices of mobile telephone services.He broke ranks with Likud after social protests in 2011 and opted to sit out the 2013 election, later forming the Kulanu party and now making a run for the Finance Ministry.Though a natural partner for Netanyahu, he is being wooed by both sides and has not ruled out joining a coalition led by Isaac Herzog of the Zionist Union.""We're 48 hours before the election, there was no doubt such spin would come,"" Kahlon told Israel Radio regarding Netanyahu's offer. ""I didn't ask for the finance portfolio from Herzog or from Netanyahu. I asked for the finance portfolio only from the public.""Beyond promising to speed up economic reforms that will lower living costs, Netanyahu has kept the focus for the most part on security issues.Over social media and broadcast interviews, the three-term leader has accused unspecified foreign governments and tycoons of funneling tens of millions of dollars to opposition activists working to undermine him and boost the Zionist Union joint list, led by Herzog and Tzipi Livni.They, in turn, have dismissed this as a bid by Netanyahu to shift voters' attention from socio-economic problems to security challenges such as the Palestinian statehood drive and Iran's nuclear diplomacy, on which the prime minister argues that he alone can resist pressure from abroad.
