President Barack Obama on Friday marked the 60th anniversary of the Supreme Court's landmark Brown v. Board of Education school desegregation decision by recommitting to ""the long struggle to stamp out bigotry and racism in all their forms."" Obama also scheduled a meeting Friday with families of the plaintiffs as well as the lead attorneys and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund.

""He will lay out why the right policy is one that is both interventionist and internationalist, but not isolationist or unilateral.""Obama, determined not to repeat what he views as the mistakes of his Republican predecessor, George W. Bush - U.S. involvement in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan - has leaned heavily on diplomatic activity instead of military force.In the case of Ukraine, he has ordered sanctions against some of Putin's inner circle and businesses associated with the Kremlin power structure but has made clear he will not threaten military force for Moscow's seizure of Crimea.The fear among some in Washington is that Obama's handling of Russia will prompt China to flex its muscles in the South China Sea, where tensions have already been rising over such actions as the placement of a Chinese oil rig in waters claimed by Vietnam.On Syria, Obama backed away from a threat to use military force over the use of chemical weapons against Syrian civilians by the Syrian government. While a deal struck with Russia is leading to the disarming of Syria's chemical weapons stockpile, the three-year-old Syrian civil war rages on and President Bashar al-Assad remains in power.Obama will emphasize that Syria remains a counter-terrorism threat as a haven for militant groups. U.S. officials have debated whether to supply heavier weapons and increase covert aid to Syrian rebels.""We do see Syria as a counter-terrorism challenge. However, the right policy approach continues to be strengthening the moderate opposition, which offers an alternative to both the brutal Assad regime, and the more extremist elements within the opposition,"" the White House official said.The official said Obama will say the United States is the only nation capable of galvanizing global action and why ""we need to put that to use in an international system that is sustainable and enduring, and that can address challenges from traditional ones, like maritime and trade issues, to emerging ones, like climate change.""(Reporting By Steve Holland; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)"

I have not heard this remark. If (it was said), then it is unacceptable. I think he himself realizes that. He is a well-brought-up person.""I know him and other members of the royal family personally. But I have got used to all kinds of things over the years.""According to a British newspaper, the 65-year-old prince made the comment earlier this week during a tour of Canada.Charles told the woman, who lost relatives during the Holocaust and was recounting how she had fled Poland, that ""Putin is doing just about the same as Hitler"".Putin's response came after Russia's foreign ministry had criticized Charles for his remarks, saying they did not reflect well on a future British monarch and were an ""unacceptable"" attempt to spread propaganda against Russia over Ukraine.The Soviet Union lost more than 20 million people in the war and the victory over Nazi Germany is celebrated across Russia as a national triumph.Putin, a former KGB spy, has repeatedly spoken about the sacrifices of what Russians call the Great Patriotic War and he himself lost a brother in the Nazi siege of Leningrad.The palace where Saturday's interview took place, where G20 leaders met last September, was itself seriously damaged between 1941 and 1944 by the German armed forces.However, Russia's annexation of Crimea has led to some in Ukraine and a few Western politicians to liken the incursion by Putin to the actions of Hitler.Former U.S. secretary of state Hillary Clinton had to clarify remarks in March suggesting Putin's justification for his actions over Crimea to protect ethnic Russians was reminiscent of claims made by Hitler over foreign territories.The prince's office and Cameron, who has scolded the Kremlin for annexing Crimea and supporting pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine, have declined to comment on Charles's reported remarks because they had been made during a private conversation.However, the comments have raised some eyebrows in Britain as the royal family is not expected to voice political views publicly and the head of state is merely a constitutional figurehead.Queen Elizabeth, Charles's 88-year-old mother, has never aired such emotive sentiments during her long reign.""In constitutional monarchy policy and diplomacy should be conducted by parliament and government,"" opposition Labor lawmaker Mike Gapes wrote on Twitter.

Although California became the first state to legalize cannabis for medicinal use in 1996, the state has yet to establish a set of standards guiding the cultivation, production and sale of the plant, which has led to what Ammiano described to The Huffington Post as ""chaos.""""I am optimistic that we can continue to work with all parties to finally create regulation that will satisfy all needs,"" Ammiano said in a statement Friday, ""from federal law enforcement down to the very sick patients who depend on the health benefits only marijuana can provide.""California currently leaves it up to local governments to decide how they want to implement the state's medical marijuana law. As a result, some cities, like San Francisco and Oakland, have established clear-cut systems that dictate where dispensaries can operate and impose fees that directly enrich their coffers. Other places, like San Diego and San Jose, remain largely unregulated, with very little control over where pot-related businesses can operate. San Jose lawmakers are currently mulling legislation that would effectively make it impossible for medical marijuana providers to exist.""Marijuana has never been regulated by the state as any other business,"" Ammiano told HuffPost last year after introducing similar legislation. ""Cities and counties don't know what to do or what they can do. Police are unsure how to respond.""AB 1894 would create a division within California's Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to regulate all medical marijuana-related entities throughout the state, from the farmers that cultivate the plant to the storefronts that sell it. The proposal would allow the agency to impose fees on marijuana businesses in order to raise revenue for the state, and local municipalities would also be allowed to impose additional taxes. ""Without regulation, there's no way to capture any of the income that could go toward our infrastructure or other worthy causes,"" Ammiano told HuffPost last month.California's lack of statewide regulations over its pot program has left it vulnerable to federal interference, as the drug is still classified as a Schedule 1 substance (along with heroin and LSD) in the eyes of the national government. In 2011, a coalition of U.S. attorneys launched an aggressive crackdown on medical marijuana operations throughout the state under the guise that the industry had spiraled out of control. Since then, hundreds of businesses related to the drug have closed, and thousands of people have lost their jobs. Last month, the Drug Enforcement Administration raided several dispensaries in Los Angeles, and a pot shop in Mendocino, closed by federal authorities earlier this year, only recently reopened.By contrast, the Obama administration has been less combative in states with more comprehensive regulations. Colorado, for example, has faced fewer DEA raids and has been allowed to implement its groundbreaking recreational, adult-use law largely in peace. Late last year, Attorney General Eric Holder indicated that the federal government would not intervene in states that had ""strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems.""""While statewide regulations won't change federal law, it does seem to be the case that states that have uniform, clear regulations are less likely to be interfered with by the feds,"" Tom Angell, the head of weed advocacy group Marijuana Majority, told HuffPost last mont. ""It's very confusing in California right now: a patchwork of regulations city to city and county to county.""Ammiano has made many attempts to create statewide medical marijuana regulations over the past few years, but each piece of legislation stalled or was defeated by opponents who argued the measures didn't address key issues like the environmental implications of growing cannabis or the criteria for doctors to make recommendations to patients. He's confident his current bill addresses every concern and more. ""I'm cautiously optimistic,"" he told HuffPost last month. ""People have seen that the more regulation you have, the less chaos you have.""Meanwhile, marijuana reform advocates believe a measure like Ammiano's is the key to paving the way for a law that would allow recreational use by adults in the state. Recent polls have suggested a majority of Californians support legalizing pot for recreational purposes, and Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) has joined an effort to place a legalization initiative on the 2016 ballot.But first, ""we need to show that California has the ability to regulate marijuana,"" Angell said. ""This would help further demonstrate how tax revenue can be generated and put into needed programs."""

The '#bringbackourgirls' slogan has become a huge global phenomenon following the abductions, albeit controversial, as world and opinion leaders get involved under its banner on social media to aggitate for the release of the girl-students by the islamist militants who continued their rampage by razing two schools in Bauchi state, northern Nigeria, where Boko Haram gunmen previously attacked a girls' school.

She fed us yogurt, cheese, butter and buttermilk from that goat, but every other day she took whatever the goat and hens produced to sell at market to pay school fees for me, my two sisters and my three brothers. She was illiterate, but full of wisdom. She knew that the only way to give us a brighter future was to educate all of her children, boys and girls. Thanks to my mother's hard work, I have been able to gain advanced degrees and now run an international charity that reaches out to poor families much like the one I grew up in. Thanks to my mother's example my four daughters are all in school or serving their communities as educated professionals. My daughters have so much to offer as professionals, as community members, and someday as mothers, that the kidnapping of nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls more than three weeks ago by the militant group Boko Haram fills my heart with a mix of dread and rage. I am encouraged that the U.S. has deployed a team to help recover the girls, but as days pass, I know they are living through hell. They are away from home, held captive and suffering through the assaults and indignities we politely call sexual slavery. This criminal act, along with similar crimes that have gone on for years -- the trafficking of girls, burning down girls' schools, terrorizing families into keeping their daughters home -- is truly an abomination. When I think about how hard my mother worked to send me and my siblings to school, I know that these girls' mothers are working just as hard. I know it! Whether they have been to school or not, mothers know how essential education is for their daughters.These Nigerian mothers and fathers who are missing their daughters so keenly right now are following in the tradition of the great Nana Asma'u, a poet, scholar and teacher who was a princess of the Sokoto Caliphate, which makes up part of modern-day Nigeria. An advocate for universal education, Nana Asma'u was fluent in four languages, the author of scores of books and organizer of a sisterhood of female teachers who taught girls and women in their homes. Nana Asma'u has been a role model for me since I entered adulthood and pursued my education, and remained a sort of guiding star as I started a family and entered humanitarian work. She understood what the development world has found to be true: educating girls is an investment with fantastic returns for individuals, communities and countries. UNESCO has shown that children born to literate mothers are 50 percent more likely to survive to age five. Girls who stay in school marry later and have smaller families, according to the U.N., which calls girls' education a ""lifeline to development."" UNICEF even offers a hint as to why militants might want to steal and enslave these girls before they can realize their full potential: ""Offering girls basic education is one sure way of giving them much greater power -- of enabling them to make genuine choices over the kinds of lives they wish to lead."" These girls deserve to have power over their own lives. Instead, Boko Haram wants to control them, and it claims that the religion of Islam supports this agenda. But in reality the relationship between women and education was forged even before Nana Asma'u's brilliance illuminated what is now Nigeria. In Islam's earliest days, Aisha, wife of the Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, became one of the central scholars and teachers of Islam after his death and educated numerous men and women, many of whom traveled long distances to learn from her.Like Aisha and Nana Asma'u these girls deserve the chance to learn, prosper and share their gifts with the world. These schoolgirls who have been stolen and subjected to horrible atrocities are our little sisters. They are tomorrow's leaders, tomorrow's teachers, tomorrow's doctors and yes, they are tomorrow's mothers. And so we must defend their right to learn, grow and flourish in safety. To comfort their mothers and defend our global tomorrow, girls must be allowed to go to school.  Khalil Demir is the executive director of the Zakat Foundation of America"
