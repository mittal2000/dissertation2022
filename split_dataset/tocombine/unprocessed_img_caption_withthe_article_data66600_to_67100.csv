0,POLITICS,Supreme Court Sides With Children Automatically Sentenced To Die In Prison,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-life-sentence-children_us_56a63efee4b0d8cc109aacac,"Under the Constitution, those sentenced as minors to mandatory life imprisonment without the possibility of parole may get a new day in court.",2016-01-25,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday offered a window to the more than 2,000 people who were sentenced as teenagers and are now serving life in prison. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday ruled that children automatically sentenced to die in prison should get an opportunity to try for a more lenient sentence.The decision, a 6-to-3 opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy, made retroactive a 2012 ruling declaring that such sentences for minors -- known as mandatory life imprisonment without the possibility of parole -- are unconstitutional.""Henry Montgomery has spent each day of the past 46 years knowing he was condemned to die in prison,"" Kennedy wrote, referencing the Louisiana man at the center of the case. ""Per­haps it can be established that, due to exceptional circumstances, this fate was a just and proportionate punishment for the crime he committed as a 17-year-old boy.""Kennedy said that ""prisoners like Montgomery must be given the opportunity to show their crime did not reflect irreparable corruption,"" thus restoring ""their hope for some years of life outside prison walls.""The chief question the justices wrestled with in Montgomery v. Louisiana was whether the 2012 decision, Miller v. Alabama, should be extended to every juvenile offender who was sentenced to die in prison without consideration of ""youth and its attendant characteristics"" -- including factors such as age, upbringing and familial environment.In answering that question affirmatively, the court reiterated the principle that ""children are constitutionally different from adults in their level of culpability"" and possess ""diminished culpability and greater prospects for reform.""But the Supreme Court didn't outright rule that life imprisonment without parole is never appropriate for youth offenders. Relying on language from prior decisions applying the Eighth Amendment to juvenile punishment, the court instead observed those sentences should still be available, but only for ""the rarest of juvenile offenders, those whose crimes reflect permanent incorrigibility.""Still, the ruling could potentially offer a window to the more than 2,000 people who were sentenced as teenagers and are now serving life in prison.""Allowing those offenders to be considered for parole ensures that juveniles whose crimes reflected only transient immaturity -- and who have since matured -- will not be forced to serve a disproportionate sentence in violation of the Eighth Amendment,"" the court said.In dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia -- joined by Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas -- assailed the court's reasoning and said that extending the 2012 precedent to juvenile sentences that predated it ""is just a devious way of eliminating life without parole for juvenile offenders"" once and for all.Scalia then offered this passage.""And then, in Godfather fashion, the majority makes state legislatures an offer they can’t refuse: Avoid all the utterly impossible nonsense we have prescribed by simply permitting juvenile homicide offenders to be considered for parole,"" he wrote.Though it is immediately unclear how the ruling will shake out in the nine or so states that disproportionately sentence juveniles to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole, Kennedy did seem to cabin his opinion by noting that giving this new opportunity to youth offenders will ""not impose an onerous burden"" on the states.""The opportunity for release will be afforded to those who demonstrate the truth of Miller’s central intuition -- that children who commit even heinous crimes are capable of change,"" he wrote."

He fled Syria three years ago with his wife and three sons to escape the fighting that had arrived at their doorstep in the city of Aleppo.In the sunny garden patio of Aleppo’s Kitchen in Anaheim, California, Hajomar’s jovial smile and portly stature give him a carefree appearance. But a closer look reveals his thinning hair and kind eyes framed with crow’s feet, signs of the stress and trauma he has endured for the past three years.Hajomar recounts his family’s narrow escape from a war that has displaced over 10 million and caused the deaths of almost 300,000 Syrians to date. “The war had come to my city, to Aleppo,” he explains. “But I’m lucky. Before it came to the city, I bought a ticket from Turkey, from Istanbul, in case something got worse.”It did get worse.After a heart-wrenching decision to abandon their home, the Hajomars made the perilous drive through the mountains of Syria into Turkey, where they boarded a plane bound for the United States. Once in Los Angeles, the Hajomars opened Aleppo’s Kitchen and began hiring refugees to help support those caught up in the conflict. They joined a robust community of Syrians and Syrian-Americans who are attempting to fight the war against Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad’s regime from over 7,000 miles away.Much of this community immigrated to the United States decades ago. The resulting population of Syrians in Southern California is one of the largest in the country. They embrace two main goals in regards to the ongoing conflict. The first is to pressure the international community to help solve the conflict inside of Syria instead of focusing solely on the resulting refugee crisis and the rising tide of Islamic extremist groups like ISIS. Their second goal is to support the immediate needs of the Syrian people and the refugees who are suffering through what the United Nations has deemed, “the largest humanitarian crisis since the Second World War.”While most of the Los Angeles Syrian community escaped the fighting, the ubiquitous nature of the war deeply affects them. “Every person here today has either lost a family member in the offense by the Syrian regime, or one of their family members has been taken into a prison and they don’t know anything about them or they have lost their homes,” says Suzanne Meriden, director of operations at the Syrian American Council (SAC). “Every one of these people has been touched in one way or another."" In response, L.A.’s Syrian community mobilized. “The community here immediately engaged in support of the revolution,” says Hussam Ayloush, executive director of the L.A. chapter of the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CARE) and National Chairman of the SAC. “Many organizations focus on advocacy and relief, on youth, and have been conducting forums, picnics, social gatherings, media gatherings, political events.” The passion and dedication of the Syrian diaspora in Los Angeles manifested in different types of activities, including political advocacy, media and education campaigns and individual grassroots efforts. The community aims to help victims of war and to end the Syrian conflict.Political AdvocacyIt has been challenging for the Syrian community to fully engage in the political process. “The Syrian-American community has not been politically very active mainly because of the fear of repression from the regime,” says Ayloush. “Everybody knows that if you get active here, the regime will punish you and punish your family members.”Despite the risks involved, political events play a critical role in the Los Angeles community’s efforts. “After the revolution, people did break this fear barrier and decided it’s worthwhile,” Ayloush continues. “If the young people of Syria were willing to take bullets during peaceful protests demanding freedom, then we might as well take that risk and stand up in support of these brave young men and women.”According to Ayloush, one of SAC’s political goals is to work with the U.S. Government to bring about change. “It could be through increasing of humanitarian assistance that we provide as the U.S. to refugees or through increasing the number of refugees admitted into the U.S, or through trying to change our foreign policy by supporting the rights of the Syrian people,” he says.The SAC’s Suzanne Meriden agrees that the community’s political efforts are fundamentally important in achieving their long-term goals. “The most important point is to tell the world that yes, it’s important to help the refugees right now,” says Meriden. “But we would actually help more people who are about to become refugees if we were to speak out to our government and ask that they do something about Syria.”Media and Education CampaignsOrganizations such as SAC and CARE are also working on publicity campaigns to help educate the American public about the ongoing conflict. “We try to work with media and the public in general to make sure that people are informed about what’s happening in Syria,” says Ayloush. “And how we, as Americans can support the Syrian people through their struggle for freedom that is going on now.""Lack of information about the Syrian conflict generated misconceptions that the advocacy organizations are working to correct. Ayloush believes that for some people, “when they think of Syria they’re thinking of terrorist groups like ISIS, or think of something that is completely removed from them, that doesn’t impact them in any way.” In his experience, education and information efforts are crucial, “to counter the misrepresentation that comes sometimes from certain pro-regime outlets or misinformation that happens because of lack of understanding.”“We’re lacking, but not because we’re not empathetic people as Americans. We’re lacking because the media is completely either distorting what’s really happening or just not sharing the truth,” Meriden agrees.Individual EffortsWhile political advocacy and media campaigns are crucial in dealing with the root of the conflict, an immediate need exists to help both the refugees and those still trapped in Syria. Nidal Hajomar found a way to help the Syrian cause through his work. And he does it right from his restaurant in Anaheim.Hajomar recalls being approached by Syrian refugees looking for work after he opened Aleppo’s Kitchen. He at first only hired them to do temporary work in his restaurant during the high-season of Ramadan. When the season ended, Hajomar found himself faced with a conflict. “I mean, where can they go?” he asks. “I don’t need them anymore but at the same time I have to do something for them. I cannot leave them. So I talk to God. I said, ‘Please God. Help me just to help them.’”Hajomar’s prayers were answered when he decided to keep his new staff working in the restaurant and to continue hiring refugees in need. He was approached by an older woman who had lost two sons in the fighting and needed to find work to support their two wives and five children.“She wanted to work but I needed somebody younger,” says Hajomar. But he could not turn her away. “I looked at her and said, ‘Okay, go ahead inside.’”Hajomar worked with his new employee to produce an updated menu featuring rare, homemade Syrian food. It was a risk, but it paid off. “Now my business is booming. Maybe because I help people, so God helped me,” he muses. In the years since, Aleppo’s Kitchen has become an informal gathering place for the Syrian support movement in L.A.For Hajomar, there is no other choice. “It’s going to be 10,000 Syrians coming. Most of them, they’re going to come to Los Angeles maybe,” he says. “So the Syrians, they should prepare themselves to help those refugees. Syrians should help Syrians.”Ayloush agrees that Syrian-Americans must continue to help their community- both locally and overseas- as the war rages on. But he also sees a place for non-Syrians in the conflict. “You don’t have to be Syrian to care about what is happening in Syria. You just have to be a caring human being,” Ayloush points out. “Get informed. This is a strive for freedom and justice, something similar to our history here in America. We struggled for liberty and justice for all. Syrians are doing the same thing.”Ayloush believes that by lobbying the American government, U.S. citizens can bring about the major political and humanitarian changes needed to end a long war.Which is exactly what Syrians like Nidal Hajomar are hoping for. “The only thing that will make us happy is when we go back home to visit those people we love,” he says. “Not now. But I hope.”This post is part of a partnership between The Huffington Post and USC Annenberg School for Communications and Journalism. Also on HuffPost:"
7,THE WORLDPOST,How A Leading Egyptian Historian Found Himself In The Middle Of A Revolution,Nick Robins-Early,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/khaled-fahmy-egypt-revolution_us_569f9e03e4b0875553c26707,"Khaled Fahmy shares his memories of Egypt's uprising, five years after Tahrir.",2016-01-25,"Fahmy and thousands of others spent 18 days in Cairo's Tahrir, demanding an end to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's authoritarian regime.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569fe84c1a00001001ab0f99.jpeg?ops=crop_1_0_420_326%2Cscalefit_1280_noupscale,"After over a decade of teaching in the United States, Professor Khaled Fahmy arrived in Cairo a few months before the Egyptian revolution. A leading historian of modern Egypt and an expert on the Middle East, he would find himself unexpectedly at the center of one of the most pivotal moments in the region's history.Fahmy joined thousands of others in Cairo's Tahrir Square, where 18 days of intense protests finally caused Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to step down after three decades in power. After Mubarak's fall in February of 2011, Fahmy continued to be an outspoken activist and writer on Egyptian affairs, accusing both the Muslim Brotherhood of former President Mohammed Morsi and current President Abdel Fattah Sisi of corrupting what the revolution tried to achieve.Fahmy, who is now a visiting professor at Harvard University, spoke with The WorldPost about the events of Egypt's revolution and the successes and failures of the Arab Spring now that five years have passed.You returned to Egypt just months before the revolution began after working abroad for years. What was Cairo like during that period before the uprising?There was something in the air. When a friend asked me in late 2010 what brought me back after so many years of living abroad, I responded that I felt something was happening. I wasn’t even thinking politically. I was thinking there was something among the youth when it came to literary and artistic production. New films, a new kind of music, new literature, regardless of the topics, were irreverent toward political authority, and of religious and political tradition.At the same time, on a political level, the actions of young people after the killing of Khaled Said, the Alexandrian activist, were unprecedented. There was something very new about this type of civil disobedience, of young men and women both in Alexandria and Cairo wearing black, holding hands in silent marches and turning their backs to the cities in protest.To me, as an academic and a historian of modern Egypt, that resonated. I could sense that something was happening, but of course I never predicted that it would take the shape it did. What are some of your strongest memories from your 18 days in Tahrir Square?The most vivid memory is from very early on in the 18 days. It was a long, difficult and dangerous day for us all -- my sister, myself and my friends. My sister got beaten and for a few hours she lost her son and then found him tear-gassed.I was with my friends in another location in the city, and was tear-gassed more than once. We tried to go across the Qasr al-Nir bridge to Tahrir but were turned back, and friends of mine left and right were falling from birdshot fired by the police. At a certain moment, I found myself trapped on a bridge leading to Tahrir that we could not cross. It wasn't just that bullets were being fired, the possibility of a stampede on that bridge was a horrifying feeling.But then the police collapsed. The police cordon was in front of us, literally a few feet away, and I could see the young police conscripts and they were terrified. I saw many of them just drop their guns and shake their heads, saying they couldn't go on. Seeing the police collapse in front of you is an unforgettable memory.When the police withdrew, it became safe for us to go to Tahrir. Their withdrawal, and the fact that the army stepped in and decided not to open fire at the protesters, allowed us to stay in Tahrir for 18 days. How did you contextualize the events during the revolution as a historian?I found myself in the midst of something that I immediately recognized as a historic moment. I usually can’t interview my historical subjects and I have to study them in a different way, but in this case I had Egyptians right in front of me. I wanted to capture this moment somehow. Immediately after Mubarak stepped down, the director of the national archives told me they were forming a committee to document the revolution and were appointing me director. This was a dream come true, and the idea was to try and find a way to capture as many voices of the thousands and thousands of people who participated in these 18 days as possible, and preserve them for posterity.Eventually the project failed. The activists who had participated in the revolution asked us a very important question: ""Can you guarantee us that what we tell you will not fall in the hands of security services? Because you’re taking our voices, which are basically self-incriminating."" I couldn’t give them that guarantee. Their fears were very valid. You've written that Egypt has trouble envisioning its future because it has trouble choosing a point in its past that it wants to resurrect. Could you expand on that idea a bit?One of the main differences between what was happening in Egypt and the Arab world on the one hand, and what had happened in Eastern Europe during its color revolutions, was this business about the past.Even in a country as complex in its history as, say, Hungary, there is a notion that if they can pretend there was an earlier moment in modern Hungarian history in which Hungary was really pure -- when it had not been contaminated by communism or the Nazi occupation or civil war -- then they can use that moment as a rallying point on which to build their hopes for the future.I think one of the problems with the Arab Spring is that we cannot as Arabs or Egyptians agree on any such moment. What is the political model or historical moment that Egyptians find most inspiring? You wipe out Mubarak and his 30 years of tyranny, but do you want to go and bring the clock back to pre-Mubarak times? Were Egyptians really happy under [former President Muhammad Anwar] Sadat or [former President Gamal Abdel] Nasser? Is the problem with the so-called July regime of the 1952 revolution? If we wipe that out, do we want to bring back a monarchy? Or is it an Islamic state that goes back to the so-called Islamic empires? Do we want to be Ottomans again? None of this is tenable. Not only historically, but as an intellectual political enterprise. What were some of the defining moments for you that led you to oppose the Muslim Brotherhood's rule under President Mohammed Morsi?Morsi’s election, for me, was a great opportunity. I thought that it would finally bring the Islamists off their pedestal, that it would finally get them to talk seriously and to offer concrete, practical answers to our problems.In public appearances, I defended Morsi and the Brotherhood. I didn’t believe the Brotherhood had an answer, but we had to accept it. I argued that's what democracy is like -- people voted, and I respected the Egyptian people and their verdict. Two moments marked a turning point. In November and December of 2012, Morsi effectively declared himself to be above the law. I did not go demonstrate in front of the presidential palace myself, but my friends did and they were tortured by Brotherhood militias, in makeshift detention centers that the Brotherhood had established in the vicinity of the presidential palace.I started wondering whether we were dealing with a political party with which one disagrees or whether we were dealing with a religious-ethnic social cult from which one is barred from entrance. I concluded we were dealing with the second. The second moment came a couple of months later, in March or April of 2013. My friends and I started working on drafting a very ambitious freedom of information law. We looked into examples of many countries across the world and we met with the drafting committee within the Ministry of Justice.There was a meeting presided over by the justice minister himself. Instead of talking about freedom of information, the minister spent an hour denying the existence of police brutality and torture in Egyptian prisons. That’s when we all lost it.Torture is a cardinal issue for me. It’s something I had been studying academically for many years and it’s what drove me to take to the streets from day one. Several months before the meeting, a cousin of a friend of mine was beaten to death in police custody, in a police jail. So I couldn't tolerate for the minister of justice to deny this is happening. I stood up and told him, ""Your excellency, we cannot sit with you. We came to discuss freedom of information, we were willing to work with you but you are coming here to talk about something completely different and something that is very sensitive and you are insulting us by saying that this is not happening, and by denying the existence of torture and police brutality.""We did not risk our lives to end up with this. So that’s when I turned against him, and the following day I went down to Tahrir and signed the petition asking for mass mobilization against Morsi. How has Egypt’s path over the last five years changed you personally?I became more aware of how intractable Egypt's problems were. Looking back at the past five years, one is much wiser because what we witnessed is something people usually only witness in a lifetime, if even that.But five years down the line, it’s not like I’ve lost my naiveté. But I’ve come to appreciate the energies of this country even more, I’ve come to see this generation of the '80s, how resourceful they were and proved themselves to be. These are now the people being rounded up and put in prison.I’ve actually been more inspired by the potential of this country, but at the same time I also have sobered up about the depths to which the Egyptian authorities can go and how ready they are to use violence and intimidation to silence opposition.If you had these five year again, would you do anything differently?That’s of course a question that we keep asking ourselves all the time, and let me say first I would still have taken to the streets against Morsi. I don’t regret it, I think he was unfit for government and I don’t ever regret the decision to demonstrate against Muslim Brotherhood rule.My regret is that we hadn’t paid enough attention to building a movement. The 18 days were unprecedented in Egyptian history. There was an unprecedented level of activism and trust in the future, a trust in public life and a belief that we needed to do this for our country. Very few nations and people pass through this moment. We did not build on this momentum, we did not try and transform this emotion into something more sober, less flamboyant, a lasting grassroots organization that can shift into a politically meaningful movement and that can take the form of a political party. We didn’t transform this energy into something more durable. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.This post is part of a series ​looking back at five years after the start of the protests in Cairo’s Tahrir Square.

After Mubarak's fall in February of 2011, Fahmy continued to be an outspoken activist and writer on Egyptian affairs, accusing both the Muslim Brotherhood of former President Mohammed Morsi and current President Abdel Fattah Sisi of corrupting what the revolution tried to achieve.Fahmy, who is now a visiting professor at Harvard University, spoke with The WorldPost about the events of Egypt's revolution and the successes and failures of the Arab Spring now that five years have passed.You returned to Egypt just months before the revolution began after working abroad for years. What was Cairo like during that period before the uprising?There was something in the air. When a friend asked me in late 2010 what brought me back after so many years of living abroad, I responded that I felt something was happening. I wasn’t even thinking politically. I was thinking there was something among the youth when it came to literary and artistic production. New films, a new kind of music, new literature, regardless of the topics, were irreverent toward political authority, and of religious and political tradition.At the same time, on a political level, the actions of young people after the killing of Khaled Said, the Alexandrian activist, were unprecedented. There was something very new about this type of civil disobedience, of young men and women both in Alexandria and Cairo wearing black, holding hands in silent marches and turning their backs to the cities in protest.To me, as an academic and a historian of modern Egypt, that resonated. I could sense that something was happening, but of course I never predicted that it would take the shape it did. What are some of your strongest memories from your 18 days in Tahrir Square?The most vivid memory is from very early on in the 18 days. It was a long, difficult and dangerous day for us all -- my sister, myself and my friends. My sister got beaten and for a few hours she lost her son and then found him tear-gassed.I was with my friends in another location in the city, and was tear-gassed more than once. We tried to go across the Qasr al-Nir bridge to Tahrir but were turned back, and friends of mine left and right were falling from birdshot fired by the police. At a certain moment, I found myself trapped on a bridge leading to Tahrir that we could not cross. It wasn't just that bullets were being fired, the possibility of a stampede on that bridge was a horrifying feeling.But then the police collapsed. The police cordon was in front of us, literally a few feet away, and I could see the young police conscripts and they were terrified. I saw many of them just drop their guns and shake their heads, saying they couldn't go on. Seeing the police collapse in front of you is an unforgettable memory.When the police withdrew, it became safe for us to go to Tahrir. Their withdrawal, and the fact that the army stepped in and decided not to open fire at the protesters, allowed us to stay in Tahrir for 18 days. How did you contextualize the events during the revolution as a historian?I found myself in the midst of something that I immediately recognized as a historic moment. I usually can’t interview my historical subjects and I have to study them in a different way, but in this case I had Egyptians right in front of me. I wanted to capture this moment somehow. Immediately after Mubarak stepped down, the director of the national archives told me they were forming a committee to document the revolution and were appointing me director. This was a dream come true, and the idea was to try and find a way to capture as many voices of the thousands and thousands of people who participated in these 18 days as possible, and preserve them for posterity.Eventually the project failed. The activists who had participated in the revolution asked us a very important question: ""Can you guarantee us that what we tell you will not fall in the hands of security services? Because you’re taking our voices, which are basically self-incriminating."" I couldn’t give them that guarantee. Their fears were very valid. You've written that Egypt has trouble envisioning its future because it has trouble choosing a point in its past that it wants to resurrect. Could you expand on that idea a bit?One of the main differences between what was happening in Egypt and the Arab world on the one hand, and what had happened in Eastern Europe during its color revolutions, was this business about the past.Even in a country as complex in its history as, say, Hungary, there is a notion that if they can pretend there was an earlier moment in modern Hungarian history in which Hungary was really pure -- when it had not been contaminated by communism or the Nazi occupation or civil war -- then they can use that moment as a rallying point on which to build their hopes for the future.I think one of the problems with the Arab Spring is that we cannot as Arabs or Egyptians agree on any such moment. What is the political model or historical moment that Egyptians find most inspiring? You wipe out Mubarak and his 30 years of tyranny, but do you want to go and bring the clock back to pre-Mubarak times? Were Egyptians really happy under [former President Muhammad Anwar] Sadat or [former President Gamal Abdel] Nasser? Is the problem with the so-called July regime of the 1952 revolution? If we wipe that out, do we want to bring back a monarchy? Or is it an Islamic state that goes back to the so-called Islamic empires? Do we want to be Ottomans again? None of this is tenable. Not only historically, but as an intellectual political enterprise. What were some of the defining moments for you that led you to oppose the Muslim Brotherhood's rule under President Mohammed Morsi?Morsi’s election, for me, was a great opportunity. I thought that it would finally bring the Islamists off their pedestal, that it would finally get them to talk seriously and to offer concrete, practical answers to our problems.In public appearances, I defended Morsi and the Brotherhood. I didn’t believe the Brotherhood had an answer, but we had to accept it. I argued that's what democracy is like -- people voted, and I respected the Egyptian people and their verdict. Two moments marked a turning point. In November and December of 2012, Morsi effectively declared himself to be above the law. I did not go demonstrate in front of the presidential palace myself, but my friends did and they were tortured by Brotherhood militias, in makeshift detention centers that the Brotherhood had established in the vicinity of the presidential palace.I started wondering whether we were dealing with a political party with which one disagrees or whether we were dealing with a religious-ethnic social cult from which one is barred from entrance. I concluded we were dealing with the second. The second moment came a couple of months later, in March or April of 2013. My friends and I started working on drafting a very ambitious freedom of information law. We looked into examples of many countries across the world and we met with the drafting committee within the Ministry of Justice.There was a meeting presided over by the justice minister himself. Instead of talking about freedom of information, the minister spent an hour denying the existence of police brutality and torture in Egyptian prisons. That’s when we all lost it.Torture is a cardinal issue for me. It’s something I had been studying academically for many years and it’s what drove me to take to the streets from day one. Several months before the meeting, a cousin of a friend of mine was beaten to death in police custody, in a police jail. So I couldn't tolerate for the minister of justice to deny this is happening. I stood up and told him, ""Your excellency, we cannot sit with you. We came to discuss freedom of information, we were willing to work with you but you are coming here to talk about something completely different and something that is very sensitive and you are insulting us by saying that this is not happening, and by denying the existence of torture and police brutality.""We did not risk our lives to end up with this. So that’s when I turned against him, and the following day I went down to Tahrir and signed the petition asking for mass mobilization against Morsi. How has Egypt’s path over the last five years changed you personally?I became more aware of how intractable Egypt's problems were. Looking back at the past five years, one is much wiser because what we witnessed is something people usually only witness in a lifetime, if even that.But five years down the line, it’s not like I’ve lost my naiveté. But I’ve come to appreciate the energies of this country even more, I’ve come to see this generation of the '80s, how resourceful they were and proved themselves to be. These are now the people being rounded up and put in prison.I’ve actually been more inspired by the potential of this country, but at the same time I also have sobered up about the depths to which the Egyptian authorities can go and how ready they are to use violence and intimidation to silence opposition.If you had these five year again, would you do anything differently?That’s of course a question that we keep asking ourselves all the time, and let me say first I would still have taken to the streets against Morsi. I don’t regret it, I think he was unfit for government and I don’t ever regret the decision to demonstrate against Muslim Brotherhood rule.My regret is that we hadn’t paid enough attention to building a movement. The 18 days were unprecedented in Egyptian history. There was an unprecedented level of activism and trust in the future, a trust in public life and a belief that we needed to do this for our country. Very few nations and people pass through this moment. We did not build on this momentum, we did not try and transform this emotion into something more sober, less flamboyant, a lasting grassroots organization that can shift into a politically meaningful movement and that can take the form of a political party. We didn’t transform this energy into something more durable. This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.This post is part of a series ​looking back at five years after the start of the protests in Cairo’s Tahrir Square.

Trump, a real estate mogul, is leading the Republican race.Sanders has railed against ""millionaires and billionaires"" and the political power they wield throughout his insurgent campaign for the Democratic nomination.""That is not what, to my view, American democracy is supposed to be about, a contest between billionaires. If that takes place, I am confident that we will win it,"" Sanders said.Many analysts believe a Bloomberg entry into the race could siphon Democratic votes and be another blow to Clinton, a former secretary of state and the wife of former President Bill Clinton.An independent bid would be a heavy lift for Bloomberg. The last major third-party candidate, Ross Perot, won 18.9 percent of the vote in 1992, which some observers believe enabled Bill Clinton to defeat then-incumbent President George H.W. Bush.Hillary Clinton, who won the Register's endorsement on the Democratic side on Saturday, said she expected to negate Bloomberg's rationale for running.""He's a good friend of mine and I am going to do the best I can that I get the nomination and we'll go from there,"" she told NBC's ""Meet the Press.""""The way I read what he said is that if I didn't get the nomination he would do it ... I will relieve him of that,"" she said.Trump noted that he and Bloomberg have differences on the issues of gun control and abortion and that he would love to compete against him. Bloomberg wants more gun control and to preserve a woman's right to choose whether to have an abortion.""I know Michael very well and would love to compete with him. He is very opposite from me on guns and pro-life ... I would love to have Michael get in the race ... I would love to compete against Michael,"" Trump told CNN.The current mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, was cool to a Bloomberg run on ABC’s ""This Week.""“I don't think the people of the country want to give more money to billionaires at this point ... I don't think most Americans think billionaires are the ones who are going to help give us a more fair economy,"" he said.(Additional reporting by Julia Edwards in Washington; Editing by Paul Simao)Also on HuffPost:"

Since then, several of the former workers have filed suits accusing the company of unfairly terminating them and executives of illegal behavior.Among those suits was one by Ruzicka, who sued the company last week, claiming that he was fired for trying to expose wrongdoing by top executives, according to the St. Paul Pioneer Press. Ruzicka claims in the suit that company president William Austin is evading paying Minnesota state taxes, fits hearing aids in the state without a license and once told him it is good for businesses to keep a separate set of records for tax officials, the Pioneer Press reported. Ruzicka also accuses Austin of encouraging manufacturers to use faulty parts for hearing aids donated to the company's foundation and using company funds for personal expenses, according to the Star Tribune.Former Operations Vice President Keith Guggenberger also sued the company in October, claiming executives retaliated against for not promoting Austin's stepson. Julie Miller, a former executive assistant, accused the firm of dismissing her for being married to a Starkey official who was fired.Starkey, in turn, has accused Ruzicka of stealing millions of dollars from the company, and accused Miller of getting ""hundreds of thousands of dollars"" from a secret account.In November, agents from the FBI and IRS raided Ruzicka's home. A company spokesman said at the time there was an investigation to determine whether Starkey had been the victim of criminal activity, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.  No wrongdoing has been settled yet.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misstated that the event was hosted by the Starkey Hearing Foundation; it was hosted by the affiliated Starkey Hearing Technologies."

Rick Snyder’s response to the water contamination crisis in Flint ― even though the situation was caused by Snyder’s own administration. “I admire Rick Snyder for stepping up right now,” Bush said on CNN’s “State of the Union.” “He’s going to the challenge. He’s fired people and accepted responsibility to fix this.”Bush’s praise comes as some are demanding Snyder’s resignation over the preventable disaster in Flint, where as many as 100,000 people have been drinking and bathing in brown, lead-contaminated water that the government previously told them was safe. As The Huffington Post’s Arthur Delaney reports, this happened because Snyder’s government gave Flint bad water treatment advice. When host Jake Tapper said he was surprised to hear positive words for Snyder given his role in the catastrophe, Bush held firm and said he’s impressed with the way the Republican governor is owning the issue. “Instead of saying, ‘The dog ate my homework, it’s someone else’s fault,’ once it became clear, he’s taking the lead now,” Bush said. “That’s exactly what I think leaders have to do.”Also on HuffPost:"

Thanks to Palin's return to the national stage in Iowa earlier this week, during which she endorsed Donald Trump, Fey had plenty of material to work with in last night's cold open. The sketch starts off with Darrell Hammond as Trump (another all-star impression) welcoming Palin to the stage. ""I am so honored to introduce my guest today. She's great,"" he says, adding, ""Course she's great, she's endorsing me, all right?"" Fey then walks out wearing a sparkly outfit that mirrored Palin's own Iowa ensemble and kicks off her endorsement speech. ""I wanted to take a break from my full-time career of writing things on Facebook to fly down here and lend my support to the next president of the United States, Donald J. Trump,"" Fey says.Throughout her speech, aimed at Americans who've lost their jobs over the years, Hammond (as Trump) provides mocking commentary in an aside. Of course, he adds a jab at Jeb Bush complete with a touch of sexism. Because what would a Trump sketch be without a sexist remark? ""Isn't she just the total package: smart, legs, yelling, everything,"" he says during Palin's speech. ""I haven't seen a woman this impressive since Jeb Bush."" After a series of bird-like cacaws and a whole lot of rhymes, Palin delivers the kicker: ""Guess what, America? I don't really think this guy should be president. I'm just here 'cause he promised me a spot in his cabinet. And I belong in a cabinet 'cause I'm full of spice and I got a great rack!""

All of which allow him to play into ― and exploit ― every media weakness and bad habit in a chase for audience and numbers.As a result, said Goodwin, the 69-year-old Trump has preempted serious scrutiny of his past, character, record in business and suitability ― if any ― for the office of president.In the old days Goodwin writes about, vetting (and probably dismissing) Trump would also have been the province of party leaders: prominent, experienced (though not necessarily wise) power brokers in politics, government, business and other upper realms of American society.But the phrase “party leader” today is an oxymoron, and picking nominees today is totally the province of voters in caucuses and primaries, which makes the civic role of the mainstream press all that more important, Goodwin observed. “We in the media are the key purveyors of the qualities of the candidates and of telling people who they are and what they stand for,” said Goodwin, a Pulitzer Prize winner whose best-selling books on Lincoln, the Roosevelts and Lyndon B. Johnson include studies of their dealings with the press.“The responsibilities are pretty great.”Is the press carrying out those responsibilities in the case of Trump?“No. I don’t think so,” she said.Every candidate is dealing with the same editorial and institutional trends: obsession with polls and conflict, the shorter attention spans of most news consumers and the ruthless aggregation, measurement and marketing of user interactions across scattered social media.But no one uses these trends as cynically or successfully as Trump to avoid the scrutiny that only the media can provide and that the media, mesmerized, is not providing. “Every day he is a new story, which is brilliant in its own right,” said Goodwin. “We see him in a debate, yelling at an opponent, or making fun of somebody or saying something outrageous.”The focus on conflict rivets attention on the present. And by constantly jabbering about polls and his chances, Trump also throws the focus on the unknowable (but cheap for the media to speculate about) future of the campaign. “It’s: ‘How is he going to do?,’” said Goodwin. “It’s: ‘How is this happening? Oh my God, he is leading! It’s possible he could win!’”By dwelling on the glittering present and the entertainingly uncertain future, Trump erases all sense of history, context and accountability for his own life and actions.“He doesn’t let you have time to go back to his past,” said Goodwin.“Do we know, at this point, about his modus operandi in business? Do we know how he treated his staff? Do we know what kind of leader he was when he was building his business? I mean, I don’t know the answers to these things.“All I know is that, when I see him now, it’s like his past is not being used by the media to tell us who the guy really is.”No person in public life is more in need of deep investigative scrutiny than Trump, said Goodwin. But the best way to tell his story is through long, complex print pieces of a kind that most audience today have little patience for.Writing about the late 19th century muckrakers, Goodwin gained an appreciation both for their methods -- they might take two years investigating an oil company -- and the patience of reform-minded readers of those times.“The trouble today is, first of all, committing the resources, and then it would be a really complex story, and given people’s attention span, who would be reading it?“And yet I have to say that print journalism is still much more able to tell a complicated story, not only because of length but because the way sentences work. It can’t be shorthanded.”Trump has another tactic for defeating press scrutiny of the traditional kind, according to Goodwin. In his role as a celebrity brand, Trump isn’t selling a movement or a specific agenda, or even the details of his own track record.He is selling his stage persona -- and the related notion that his supporters can somehow mimic him by voting for him. It’s a materialistic version of a religious appeal: the “prosperity gospel” of Norman Vincent Peale and Rev. Ike.Or it’s like becoming another Beyoncé by buying her lipstick. “It’s the idea that he’s ‘The One’ and that they can BECOME him,” said Goodwin. “You’re always looking for a leader who is going to have an impact on your life. I mean, it makes some sense. But in another way it makes no sense at all.”Media amplifies the presumed power of Trump by conflating celebrity with clout and voters’ faith in an agenda with fan worship.“Bernie Sanders is a movement; Trump is not a movement. What movement was he ever in? What movement is he in now?“It’s just him.

24,LATINO VOICES,This Medical School’s Effort To Help Dreamers Could Benefit Entire Communities,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dreamers-medical-school_us_568be522e4b0b958f65ce7ed,"""It's definitely my duty to turn around, give a hand and give back.""",2016-01-24,Emelin Garcia receives her white coat at a ceremony at Stritch School of Medicine at Loyola University Chicago.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568bebf5190000190178b0f7.jpeg?cache=rVUfvyXZdZ&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Diana Andino first started researching medical school -- something she had been working toward for years -- she hit a brick wall. Andino, who was born in Ecuador, is undocumented. Most of the schools she considered or contacted wouldn't take her because she didn't have a Social Security number and wouldn't be legally eligible to work. She kept preparing anyway, finishing her undergraduate degree at the University of Houston in 2011 and volunteering at clinics. When classmates asked her why she wasn't applying to medical school like they were, she didn't know what to tell them. ""It was discouraging seeing them apply and I was just like, I know I have everything to be in medical school but I cannot apply because I don't have a 9-digit Social Security number,"" Andino said. ""It was really frustrating at times."" That changed in 2012, when she received the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, status, for so-called Dreamers. President Barack Obama's program was a turning point in many undocumented young people's lives -- finally, they could apply to work legally and stay in the country they'd called home for years. Andino applied when the program opened in August 2012, and was approved soon after. In the years since, nearly 700,000 people have gained DACA status.There was also an unexpected upside, both for DACA recipients and a medical profession facing a shortage of doctors and a growing immigrant population to serve. The door is being opened for doctors who want to work in underserved communities like the ones where they grew up.As of 2015, 50 medical schools out of 142 surveyed said they would admit students with DACA status, according to the Association of American Medical Colleges. But that doesn't mean all of them have actually done so. One school in particular has made an unprecedented effort to not only allow Dreamers to enroll, but also encourage them and help pay for it -- a difficult endeavor since undocumented immigrants can't receive federal student aid. Loyola University Chicago's Stritch School of Medicine was the first to invite and admit students with DACA status in 2014. Now, it has 20 Dreamers enrolled -- 14 in the first-year medical class and six in the second-year.""Our school is now producing physicians, some 160 per class, who know an awful lot and are able to treat immigrant patients in a way that they never would have been able to before,"" said Mark G. Kuczewski, chair of its Department of Medical Education. ""That is the benefit of diversity, is what they bring to the school,"" he added. ""Everybody learns something about everybody.""Andino applied to 11 schools, but Loyola was the only one that could help her get the funding she needed. Trinity Health, which owns the Loyola University Health System, is granting four-year loans with low interest rates for seven DACA recipient medical students. Loyola’s undergraduate college also just began a student-led scholarship fund that will raise about $50,000 per academic year. Those funds will be matched by Don Graham, who founded the group TheDream.US to give scholarships to Dreamers.When Andino graduates, as part of a requirement for the loan she received from the state, she'll go to work in an underserved area of Illinois.Her story is similar to those of her DACA recipient classmates. Most of them became interested in medicine after watching their friends and families struggle to find health care, translating for them when they did. Researchers from the UCLA Center for the Study of Latino Health and Culture argued in a 2014 paper that more medical schools should admit more undocumented students in part because of those experiences, which could inspire them to fill much-needed primary care roles in underserved and low-income communities.Emelin Garcia Nieto, 22, noticed while translating for others how much more comfortable other immigrants felt when dealing with medical professionals they could talk to in their native language.""My community was definitely -- is still -- underserved, so having that experience and wanting to give back and making the community healthier or better,"" Garcia Nieto said. ""Going through it definitely gives me experience and I think that's definitely why I want to give back. I was able to be successful but it hasn't been that way for everyone. It's definitely my duty to turn around, give a hand and give back.""When Silvia Plascencia, 22, was growing up, her family didn't have insurance and had to drive about two hours to go to free clinics. ""I realized that the only way to give back my appreciation for those physicians was to try to do it myself for other people,"" she said.Plascencia also wants to help other undocumented students, who might think they can't go to college -- something she struggled with herself when a high school counselor told her she had few options, given her legal status. She applied for and received scholarships that helped fund her undergraduate degree, and now is in her first year at Loyola. ""We're living proof that it is possible,"" Plascencia said. ""It might be a little bit more challenging, but sharing that is really important.""Manuel Bernal, a 25-year-old who came to the U.S. from Mexico when he was aged two, found the school after a series of let-downs from others that said they couldn't take him. He stumbled across a blog post that said Loyola was accepting applications from DACA recipients for its summer program. Bernal was accepted, and then he applied for medical school there. Now he's in his second year, and preparing for his first set of board exams this summer.""Coming from Tennessee where I was always told to be very quiet about my immigration status, to be able to share with classmates, share with faculty, share with mentors, and be open about my experiences, my journey, that was big,"" Bernal said.CLARIFICATION: This article has been updated to clarify that Loyola's student-led scholarship fund was an undergraduate initiative.

(Spoilers for ""Degrassi: Next Class"" and other shows ahead!)The new series, ""Next Class,"" revisits the issue of school shootings in its finale ""#SorryNotSorry."" The episode follows introverted sophomore Hunter Hollingsworth (Spencer MacPherson), who is shunned by his peers after he's exposed as one of the trolls who threatened a fellow student on social media. Unlike the series' first take on on the subject, there's no actual shooting this time around. But the episode serves as a reminder that just like sex, drugs and acne, the threat of gun violence in schools is very much something that teens have to worry about. ""Degrassi"" is shot and set in Toronto, but the show's biggest fan base is in the U.S., thanks to its presence on TeenNick. And with every passing year, the production of the show becomes shiner and the new cast members more attractive -- in other words, more Americanized. While the issues Canadian and American teens deal with generally aren't so different, it's important to note that from the time the series first tackled the issue in 2004 until its most recent episode, there were a total of seven school shooting in Canada, versus 163 school shootings in the United States in the past three years alone.The show's executive producer and writer, Sarah Glinski, told E! News that, in tackling the school shooting storyline again, the writers always knew they didn't want the character to go through with the act this time around. ""We had talked about the finale episode and him bringing a gun to school, I think we always knew that we didn't want him to do it,"" she said. ""We wanted to talk about what people [like Hunter] needed from the people around them, from their friends and family, so they're not alone, that there's an opportunity to talk them back. So that was always the plan.""Even though no shots were fired in the episode, it still should have been shocking to viewers. As Glinski noted, in 2004, a student bringing a gun to school was surprising. In 2014, after the massive increase in school shootings shown in the media, that same storyline isn't.""Back then, in season four, I don't think anyone would've ever expected Rick to bring a gun to school,"" Glinski said. ""[Now, y]ou can watch kids on Twitter, they're like, 'Oh my goodness, I think Hunter is going to bring a gun to school.'""While at this point, yet another school shooting episode may seem trite, the data prove it's as relevant as ever. ""Degrassi"" isn't the first -- and likely won't be the last -- TV show to depict a school shooting on screen. In fact, the subject has been a surprisingly common theme in some of our favorite TV shows since the mid-'90s. Read on to see which shows tackled the topic successfully and which fell flat.""My So Called Life"" (1994)""My So Called Life"" addressed school shootings in the episode ""Guns and Gossip."" After a gunshot goes off in school, Brian Krakow (Devon Gummersall) feels pressured to tell someone that Rickie (Wilson Cruz) brought the gun, even though it wasn't true. Rickie did, however, want people to think he brought the gun, thinking it would stop others from bullying him for his sexuality. Aside from touching on gun violence, the episode brought attention to the potential effects bullying can have on an impressionable teen mind.But not everyone thought it was successful. Reflecting on the episode in 2014, Gawker's Jacob Clifton said, ""Rickie's defense of high school concealed-carry basically comes down to 'the only thing that can stop a bully with a gun is a gay kid with a gun,' which works on a character level but is some bullshit by any other standard."" The episode aired at a time when guns and metal detectors in school were a big topic of discussion, as the AV Club noted.""7th Heaven"" (1998)In ""Johnny Get Your Gun"" the show tackled the general theme of violence among children. In one scene, Simon (David Gallagher) is threatened by Johnny (Jake Richardson), a classmate and the ex-boyfriend of Simon's new girlfriend, who says he's going to kill him. Simon's dad, Eric (Stephen Collins), finds himself trying to protect his son and ends up getting shot by Johnny instead. The episode ultimately drove home the ""if you see something, say something"" message. It was extra sensitive because it dealt with young kids, who arguably don't always know how serious the consequences of their actions can be.""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" (1999)The episode ""Earshot"" first aired almost exactly five months after Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold murdered 13 people and injured 21 others when they opened fire at Columbine High School on April 20, 1999.The shooting was still fresh in most people's minds when the show aired the episode in which its teen vampire hunter (Sarah Michelle Gellar) develops the ability to read minds and learns that a fellow Sunnydale High student is plotting to kill everyone. Ironically, the episode wasn't a response to the massacre at Columbine but was originally slated to air a week after the shooting. For a show like ""Buffy,"" which dealt with a new Big Bad each season, a boy with a gun proved to be just as terrifying as anything the Hellmouth could throw at the Scooby Gang. ""Degrassi: The Next Generation"" (2004)After being pranked on a quiz show by his peers, Rick finally snaps and ends up shooting Jimmy, who he thinks was responsible for the prank, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down. He also aims at Emma (Miriam McDonald), claiming that she just ""played him"" when they were dating. But before Rick can shoot Emma, Sean (Daniel Clark) intervenes to protect her and accidentally shoots Rick. Rick's motives are nothing new. Bullying is often cited as a reason for these acts of terror, while the shooters' feelings of being ignored or mistreated by women are another (as was the case in the horrific Isla Vista shootings). The storyline continued in future seasons, as Jimmy's paralysis was a constant reminder of the tragic events that happened in the school hallways. ""One Tree Hill"" (2006)In the episode ""With Tired Eyes, Tired Minds, Tired Souls, We Slept,"" ""One Tree Hill"" brought back Jimmy Edwards (Colin Fickes), a character who had been shuffled off the series after Season 1. Jimmy’s anger toward his former friends and tormentors at school resonated deeply with Tree Hill’s residents and the audience, both of whom had largely forgotten he existed.After the episode aired, Hilarie Burton, whose character, Peyton, was injured in the shooting, revealed that many members of the cast were uncomfortable tackling the subject matter.""We got the script, we were very upset about it... We were like 'This hasn't happened in so long. Why would we bring this up? We don't want to encourage or give attention to that kind of behavior,'"" she told Fanvasion. ""Then literally while we're having this conversation with our creator and our bosses, two incidents happened.""The episode, which was later dubbed ""the Columbine episode,"" was well-received by critics who called it ""a turning point for the series."" ""American Horror Story"" (2011)When we're introduced to Tate Langdon (Evan Peters) in Season 1 of ""American Horror Story,"" we don't know that he's actually dead. We eventually find out in episode 6, ""Piggy Piggy,"" that he was shot by police after he opened fire at his high school. The episode is set in 1994, five years before the Columbine shootings took place. The storyline seemingly aimed for shock value more than anything else, and in the context of the show, it worked. It didn't sit so well with critics, though, and garnered backlash with some saying it ""went too far."" ""Obviously everything on the show, if done in real life, is insanely terrible -- maybe a viewer somewhere knew a man who had his neck snapped while drowning in an apple-bobbing tub and was gravely offended when the show did that -- but this particular set piece seemed so deliberately exact,"" The Atlantic's Richard Lawson wrote in a recap. ""There was a particular event, or events, that they were trying to directly evoke and that's just cruel.""Glee"" (2013)In the episode titled ""Shooting Star,"" the New Directions are forced to hide in the choir room after hearing two gunshots. Except it wasn’t a school shooting at all. Becky (Lauren Potter), a cheerleader with Down syndrome, brought a gun to school because she was afraid of the future and didn’t want her friend Brittany to graduate. Coach Sylvester (Jane Lynch) takes the blame for mentee Becky, who accidentally fired the gun before surrendering it to Coach; no one was injured in the episode. In typical ""Glee"" fashion, the show never honestly engaged with Becky’s experience, leaving her storyline largely unresolved. As BuzzFeed’s Louis Peitman pointed out, saddling Becky with the shooting plot was problematic, especially considering how many viewers drew connections between autism and Newtown, Connecticut shooter Adam Lanza.The episode also garnered plenty of backlash, especially from the Newtown community, who were upset that no one among them was notified about the subject matter ahead of time. ""Degrassi: Next Class"" (2016)In ""#SorryNotSorry,"" the ""Next Class"" Season 1 finale, Hunter brings a gun to a school dance after being shunned by his peers. In the buildup to the dramatic scene, Hunter snaps at one of his best friends, argues with his mom about confiscating his electronics and even writes a ""kill list."" The shooting ultimately doesn't happen, as Hunter's older brother manages to call the police before anything fatal occurs. Like Rick in ""Degrassi: The Next Generation,"" Hunter is portrayed as someone who feels misunderstood and targeted by others. Once again, the show manages to depict a school shooting with sensitivity while also bringing awareness to issues like cyber bullying and mental health. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that ""Degrassi"" aired its school shooting episode 15 seasons ago, when in fact, it aired 11 seasons ago.NOTE: Seven school shootings occurred in Canada from the time ""Degrassi"" first tackled the issue in 2004 until its most recent episode on Jan. 15.

We are conceived, born and die in a bed. We make love, sleep, dream, heal and are entertained in our bed. We burrow deeply into it in times of sorrow and awaken to a new day from it each morning.Our very first bed was a cradle of loving arms with an undulating soft chest as a mattress. It was alive, sensitive and responsive to our subtlest needs. Sleep was a dynamic process, a natural collaboration between the sleeper and this living cradle. Unfortunately, this sense of an organic sleep experience is quickly forgotten as we grow up. The bed devolves into a thing - an inert piece of furniture or equipment where we stash the body for its overnight recharge.I don't mean to sound animistic and suggest the bed is alive in any literal sense, but I am suggesting that it is more like a vehicle than a static piece of furniture. Children, who intuitively sense that sleep and dreams carry them to another world, are frequently drawn to beds in the shapes of cars, trains, wagons, boats and airplanes. Although beds and vehicles may appear to be complete opposites in one respect, they actually have much in common. Both transport us to another place. And although often taken for granted, both cars and beds require a dynamic relationship with their owners. Just as we think about car and driver, it's useful to think in terms of the bed and sleeper.A good car integrates performance, comfort and safety. We expect it to perform - to provide us with reliable and efficient transportation while requiring minimal maintenance. Of course, we also prefer that it transport us comfortably. And we fully expect that it will do so safely. Cars can also be personalized, allowing us to configure seats, mirrors, sound systems, GPS, temperature, and other variables.We also want our bed to perform well - to be reliable and easy to maintain. We expect a good bed to be comfortable. Advances in technology provide us with expanded options for enhancing comfort, especially in terms of adjustability and temperature management. And we want the bed to be safe - think fire-retardant and bed bug resistant. A good bed can also be personalized with a broad range of bedding and sleep accessories. But the bed is so much more than a mechanistic vehicle - it's a magic carpet. It whisks us from the ordinary world of waking to the expansive and mysterious world of slumber. The bed is a personal stargate, a portal that catapults us to extraordinary landscapes in consciousness - to sleep and dreams and all those ineffable and liminal places surrounding them. But for too many, the bed has become a battlefield. Many millions of us struggle nightly with insomnia, nightmares and other sleep challenges. People with long histories of sleeplessness tell their doctors they hate their beds and they often grow anxious as bedtime nears. They pray for a peaceful night while remaining on guard for yet another battle. A simple shift in perspective about the bed-and-sleeper relationship can help bring more peace to our nights. Good sleepers commonly assert that they love their beds and are often delighted as bedtime draws near. Because they feel perfectly safe there, good sleepers let their guard down as they slip into bed. They don't just sleep on a bed - they sleep with it. And though it may seem silly to romanticize the bed, doing so can rekindle that deep trust we experienced as babes cradled in loving arms."

What follows are eleven of the best strategies that successful people use in these moments.,2016-01-24,Portrait happy man exults pumping fists ecstatic celebrates success screaming under money rain falling down dollar bills banknotes isolated gray background with copy space. Financial freedom concept,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb33ad9240000320055caa7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Our brains are hardwired to make much of modern life difficult. This is especially true when it comes to dealing with uncertainty. On the bright side, if you know the right tricks, you can override your brain's irrational tendencies and handle uncertainty effectively.Our brains give us fits when facing uncertainty because they're wired to react to it with fear. In a recent study, a Caltech neuroeconomist imaged subjects' brains as they were forced to make increasingly uncertain bets -- the same kind of bets we're forced to make on a regular basis in business.The less information the subjects had to go on, the more irrational and erratic their decisions became. You might think the opposite would be true -- the less information we have, the more careful and rational we are in evaluating the validity of that information. Not so. As the uncertainty of the scenarios increased, the subjects' brains shifted control over to the limbic system, the place where emotions, such as anxiety and fear, are generated.This brain quirk worked great eons ago, when cavemen entered an unfamiliar area and didn't know who or what might be lurking behind the bushes. Overwhelming caution and fear ensured survival. But that's not the case today. This mechanism, which hasn't evolved, is a hindrance in the world of business, where uncertainty rules and important decisions must be made every day with minimal information.As we face uncertainty, our brains push us to overreact. Successful people are able to override this mechanism and shift their thinking in a rational direction. This requires emotional intelligence (EQ), and it's no wonder that -- among the one million-plus people that TalentSmart has tested­ -- 90% of top performers have high EQs. They earn an average of $28,000 more per year than their low-EQ counterparts do.To boost your EQ, you have to get good at making sound decisions in the face of uncertainty, even when your brain fights against this. Fear not! There are proven strategies that you can use to improve the quality of your decisions when your emotions are clouding your judgment. What follows are eleven of the best strategies that successful people use in these moments.They quiet their limbic systemsThe limbic system responds to uncertainty with a knee-jerk fear reaction, and fear inhibits good decision-making. People who are good at dealing with uncertainty are wary of this fear and spot it as soon as it begins to surface. In this way, they can contain it before it gets out of control. Once they are aware of the fear, they label all the irrational thoughts that try to intensify it as irrational fears­ -- not reality ­- -and the fear subsides. Then they can focus more accurately and rationally on the information they have to go on. Throughout the process, they remind themselves that a primitive part of their brain is trying to take over and that the logical part needs to be the one in charge. In other words, they tell their limbic system to settle down and be quiet until a hungry tiger shows up.  They stay positivePositive thoughts quiet fear and irrational thinking by focusing your brain's attention on something that is completely stress-free. You have to give your wandering brain a little help by consciously selecting something positive to think about. Any positive thought will do to refocus your attention. When things are going well and your mood is good, this is relatively easy. When you're stressing over a tough decision and your mind is flooded with negative thoughts, this can be a challenge. In these moments, think about your day, and identify one positive thing that happened, no matter how small. If you can't think of anything from the current day, reflect on the previous day or days or even the previous week, or perhaps you're looking forward to an exciting event. The point here is that you must have something positive that you're ready to shift your attention to when your thoughts turn negative due to the stress of uncertainty.They know what they know -- and what they don'tWhen uncertainty makes a decision difficult, it's easy to feel as if everything is uncertain, but that's hardly ever the case. People who excel at managing uncertainty start by taking stock of what they know and what they don't know and assigning a factor of importance to each. They gather all the facts they have, and they take their best shot at compiling a list of things they don't know, for example, what a country's currency is going to do or what strategy a competitor will employ. They actually try to identify as many of these things as possible because this takes away their power.They embrace that which they can't controlWe all like to be in control. After all, people who feel like they're at the mercy of their surroundings never get anywhere in life. But this desire for control can backfire when you see everything that you can't control or don't know as a personal failure. People who excel at managing uncertainty aren't afraid to acknowledge what's causing it. In other words, successful people live in the real world. They don't paint any situation as better or worse than it actually is, and they analyze the facts for what they are. They know that the only thing they really control is the process through which they reach their decisions. That's the only rational way to handle the unknown, and the best way to keep your head on level ground. Don't be afraid to step up and say, ""Here's what we don't know, but we're going forward based on what we do know. We may make mistakes, but that's a lot better than standing still.""  They focus only on what mattersSome decisions can make or break your company. Most just aren't that important. The people who are the best at making decisions in the face of uncertainty don't waste their time getting stuck on decisions where the biggest risk is looking foolish in front of their co-workers. When it comes down to it, almost every decision contains at least a small factor of uncertainty -- it's an inevitable part of doing business. Learning to properly balance the many decisions on your plate, however, allows you to focus your energy on the things that matter and to make more informed choices. It also removes the unnecessary pressure and distraction caused by a flurry of small worries.They don't seek perfectionEmotionally intelligent people don't set perfection as their target because they know there's no such thing as a perfect decision in an uncertain situation. Think about it: human beings, by our very nature, are fallible. When perfection is your goal, you're always left with a nagging sense of failure, and you end up spending your time lamenting what you failed to accomplish and what you should have done differently, instead of enjoying what you were able to achieve.They don't dwell on problemsWhere you focus your attention determines your emotional state. When you fixate on the problems that you're facing, you create and prolong negative emotions and stress, which hinders performance. When you focus on actions to better yourself and your circumstances, you create a sense of personal efficacy that produces positive emotions and improves performance. Emotionally intelligent people don't allow themselves to become preoccupied with the uncertainties they face. Instead, they focus all their attention and effort on what they can do, in spite of the uncertainty, to better their situation.They know when to trust their gutOur ancestors relied on their intuition -- their gut instinct -- for survival. Since most of us don't face life-or-death decisions every day, we have to learn how to use this instinct to our benefit. Often we make the mistake of talking ourselves out of listening to our gut instinct, or we go too far in the other direction and impulsively dive into a situation, mistaking our assumptions for instincts. People who successfully deal with uncertainty recognize and embrace the power of their gut instincts, and they rely on some tried-and-true strategies to do so successfully:They recognize their own filters.They're able to identify when they're being overly influenced by their assumptions and emotions or by another person's opinion, for example. Their ability to filter out the feelings that aren't coming from their intuition helps them focus on what is.They give their intuition some space. Gut instincts can't be forced. Our intuition works best when we're not pressuring it to come up with a solution. Albert Einstein said he got his best ideas while sailing, and when Steve Jobs was faced with a tough problem, he'd head out for a walk.They build a track record. People who deal well with uncertainty take the time to practice their intuition. They start by listening to their gut on small things and seeing how it goes so that they'll know whether they can trust it when something big comes around.They have contingency plans . . .Staying on top of uncertainty is as much about planning for failure as it is about hoping for the best. Experts at handling uncertainty aren't afraid to admit that they could be wrong, and that frees them up to make detailed, rational, and transparent contingency plans before taking action.

An easy way to do this lies in something that you have to do every day anyway -- breathing. The practice of being in the moment with your breathing trains your brain to focus solely on the task at hand and quiets distracting thoughts. When you're feeling overwhelmed, take a couple of minutes to focus on your breathing. Close the door, put away all other distractions, and just sit in a chair and breathe. The goal is to spend the entire time focused only on your breathing, which will prevent your mind from wandering. Think about how it feels to breathe in and out. This sounds simple, but it's hard to do for more than a minute or two. It's all right if you get sidetracked by another thought -- this is sure to happen at the beginning -- and you just need to bring your focus back to your breathing. If staying focused on your breathing proves to be a real struggle, try counting each breath in and out until you get to twenty, and then start again from one. Don't worry if you lose count; you can always just start over.

This is especially true when it comes to dealing with uncertainty. On the bright side, if you know the right tricks, you can override your brain's irrational tendencies and handle uncertainty effectively.Our brains give us fits when facing uncertainty because they're wired to react to it with fear. In a recent study, a Caltech neuroeconomist imaged subjects' brains as they were forced to make increasingly uncertain bets -- the same kind of bets we're forced to make on a regular basis in business.The less information the subjects had to go on, the more irrational and erratic their decisions became. You might think the opposite would be true -- the less information we have, the more careful and rational we are in evaluating the validity of that information. Not so. As the uncertainty of the scenarios increased, the subjects' brains shifted control over to the limbic system, the place where emotions, such as anxiety and fear, are generated.This brain quirk worked great eons ago, when cavemen entered an unfamiliar area and didn't know who or what might be lurking behind the bushes. Overwhelming caution and fear ensured survival. But that's not the case today. This mechanism, which hasn't evolved, is a hindrance in the world of business, where uncertainty rules and important decisions must be made every day with minimal information.As we face uncertainty, our brains push us to overreact. Successful people are able to override this mechanism and shift their thinking in a rational direction. This requires emotional intelligence (EQ), and it's no wonder that -- among the one million-plus people that TalentSmart has tested­ -- 90% of top performers have high EQs. They earn an average of $28,000 more per year than their low-EQ counterparts do.To boost your EQ, you have to get good at making sound decisions in the face of uncertainty, even when your brain fights against this. Fear not! There are proven strategies that you can use to improve the quality of your decisions when your emotions are clouding your judgment. What follows are eleven of the best strategies that successful people use in these moments.They quiet their limbic systemsThe limbic system responds to uncertainty with a knee-jerk fear reaction, and fear inhibits good decision-making. People who are good at dealing with uncertainty are wary of this fear and spot it as soon as it begins to surface. In this way, they can contain it before it gets out of control. Once they are aware of the fear, they label all the irrational thoughts that try to intensify it as irrational fears­ -- not reality ­- -and the fear subsides. Then they can focus more accurately and rationally on the information they have to go on. Throughout the process, they remind themselves that a primitive part of their brain is trying to take over and that the logical part needs to be the one in charge. In other words, they tell their limbic system to settle down and be quiet until a hungry tiger shows up.  They stay positivePositive thoughts quiet fear and irrational thinking by focusing your brain's attention on something that is completely stress-free. You have to give your wandering brain a little help by consciously selecting something positive to think about. Any positive thought will do to refocus your attention. When things are going well and your mood is good, this is relatively easy. When you're stressing over a tough decision and your mind is flooded with negative thoughts, this can be a challenge. In these moments, think about your day, and identify one positive thing that happened, no matter how small. If you can't think of anything from the current day, reflect on the previous day or days or even the previous week, or perhaps you're looking forward to an exciting event. The point here is that you must have something positive that you're ready to shift your attention to when your thoughts turn negative due to the stress of uncertainty.They know what they know -- and what they don'tWhen uncertainty makes a decision difficult, it's easy to feel as if everything is uncertain, but that's hardly ever the case. People who excel at managing uncertainty start by taking stock of what they know and what they don't know and assigning a factor of importance to each. They gather all the facts they have, and they take their best shot at compiling a list of things they don't know, for example, what a country's currency is going to do or what strategy a competitor will employ. They actually try to identify as many of these things as possible because this takes away their power.They embrace that which they can't controlWe all like to be in control. After all, people who feel like they're at the mercy of their surroundings never get anywhere in life. But this desire for control can backfire when you see everything that you can't control or don't know as a personal failure. People who excel at managing uncertainty aren't afraid to acknowledge what's causing it. In other words, successful people live in the real world. They don't paint any situation as better or worse than it actually is, and they analyze the facts for what they are. They know that the only thing they really control is the process through which they reach their decisions. That's the only rational way to handle the unknown, and the best way to keep your head on level ground. Don't be afraid to step up and say, ""Here's what we don't know, but we're going forward based on what we do know. We may make mistakes, but that's a lot better than standing still.""  They focus only on what mattersSome decisions can make or break your company. Most just aren't that important. The people who are the best at making decisions in the face of uncertainty don't waste their time getting stuck on decisions where the biggest risk is looking foolish in front of their co-workers. When it comes down to it, almost every decision contains at least a small factor of uncertainty -- it's an inevitable part of doing business. Learning to properly balance the many decisions on your plate, however, allows you to focus your energy on the things that matter and to make more informed choices. It also removes the unnecessary pressure and distraction caused by a flurry of small worries.They don't seek perfectionEmotionally intelligent people don't set perfection as their target because they know there's no such thing as a perfect decision in an uncertain situation. Think about it: human beings, by our very nature, are fallible. When perfection is your goal, you're always left with a nagging sense of failure, and you end up spending your time lamenting what you failed to accomplish and what you should have done differently, instead of enjoying what you were able to achieve.They don't dwell on problemsWhere you focus your attention determines your emotional state. When you fixate on the problems that you're facing, you create and prolong negative emotions and stress, which hinders performance. When you focus on actions to better yourself and your circumstances, you create a sense of personal efficacy that produces positive emotions and improves performance. Emotionally intelligent people don't allow themselves to become preoccupied with the uncertainties they face. Instead, they focus all their attention and effort on what they can do, in spite of the uncertainty, to better their situation.They know when to trust their gutOur ancestors relied on their intuition -- their gut instinct -- for survival. Since most of us don't face life-or-death decisions every day, we have to learn how to use this instinct to our benefit. Often we make the mistake of talking ourselves out of listening to our gut instinct, or we go too far in the other direction and impulsively dive into a situation, mistaking our assumptions for instincts. People who successfully deal with uncertainty recognize and embrace the power of their gut instincts, and they rely on some tried-and-true strategies to do so successfully:They recognize their own filters.They're able to identify when they're being overly influenced by their assumptions and emotions or by another person's opinion, for example. Their ability to filter out the feelings that aren't coming from their intuition helps them focus on what is.They give their intuition some space. Gut instincts can't be forced. Our intuition works best when we're not pressuring it to come up with a solution. Albert Einstein said he got his best ideas while sailing, and when Steve Jobs was faced with a tough problem, he'd head out for a walk.They build a track record. People who deal well with uncertainty take the time to practice their intuition. They start by listening to their gut on small things and seeing how it goes so that they'll know whether they can trust it when something big comes around.They have contingency plans . . .Staying on top of uncertainty is as much about planning for failure as it is about hoping for the best. Experts at handling uncertainty aren't afraid to admit that they could be wrong, and that frees them up to make detailed, rational, and transparent contingency plans before taking action. Successful people know they aren't always going to make the right decision. They know how to absorb and understand mistakes so that they can make better decisions in the future. And they never let mistakes get them down for too long.. . . but they don't ask, ""What if?""""What if?"" statements throw fuel on the fire of stress and worry, and there's no place for them in your thinking once you have good contingency plans in place. Things can go in a million different directions, and the more time you spend worrying about the possibilities, the less time you'll spend focusing on taking action that will calm you down and keep your stress under control. Successful people know that asking ""what if?"" will only take them to a place they don't want, or need, to go to.When all else fails, they breatheYou have to remain calm to make good decisions in the face of uncertainty.

Hundreds of Occupy Wall Street participants held a march to mark the movement's anniversary.

Though such debates stretch back centuries, only recently have academics gotten the ability to use data to test how well legislatures represent the people they ostensibly serve. So far, the evidence hasn't been kind, with two leading academics arguing recently that, ""the preferences of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.""That's academic for: ""American democracy is a joke.""Much of the academic work, and nearly all of the press coverage of the field, has focused solely on the United States. In a new working paper, a luminary in the field, political scientist Larry Bartels, expands his analysis to explore the relationship between policy and public preferences to the international arena. First, Bartels finds increasing demand for a stronger safety net across in many countries where data stretch back more than two decades, including the United States. (Indeed, support for more social spending has increased the most dramatically in the U.S.). He does so by using a question that asks individuals to indicate where they would like more government spending. (The question notes that tax increases may be necessary to boost government spending.) Although there are eight spending areas in the International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) data, Bartels focuses in on four: pensions, health, unemployment benefits and education.While it initially appears that policymakers respond to changes in public preferences, Bartels shows that in fact the changes are endogenous. When Bartels controls for economic growth and unemployment, the apparent relationship between public opinion and public spending is eliminated. (See the dashed line in the figure below.)Bartels finds massive differences between the rich and poor on preferences for social spending, budget cutting and ""welfare state values."" To determine public support for budget cutting, Bartels used a question that asked whether cuts in government spending as ""some things the government might do for the economy."" What Bartels refers to as ""welfare state values"" are these questions: ""On the whole, do you think it should or should not be the government's responsibility to provide a job for everyone who wants one?"" and ""On the whole, do you think it should or should not be the government's responsibility to reduce income differences between the rich and the poor?""As the chart shows, the rich are less supportive of social spending, more supportive of budget cuts, and opposed to government guaranteeing jobs and reducing inequality (""welfare state values"").The United States was a leader in class conflict, with the largest gap between the rich and poor on social spending of any nation, the second highest gap on budget-cutting preferences (only Finland had a greater level of class conflict) and the fourth highest gap on welfare state values (after Netherlands, Sweden and New Zealand). The Nordic countries had among the highest gaps in opinion, suggesting that many of the rich may feel that the country has gone too far to reduce inequality and providing public goods. In only one country, South Korea, were the rich more supportive of higher social spending than the poor. In all countries, the wealthy were less supportive of ""welfare state values"" than the poor.When Bartels compared the policy preferences of the rich and poor to actual policy results (with controls) his results were disturbing. He finds that low-income preferences had virtually no effect on policy outcomes.Then Bartels, in a deeply original and important contribution to the literature, estimates what the effect of equal representation would be on social spending, and uses that measurement to conclude that, by contrast, biased responsiveness reduces real social spending per capita by 28 percent on average. In the United States, he finds that the gap is around 40 percent.To repeat: Social spending in the United States is 40 percent lower than it would be if policymakers didn't disproportionately respond to the rich.A paper by researcher Derek A Epp, currently under review, suggests one possible source of the problem: ""During periods of high inequality the government engages in fewer policy activities on a narrower range of topics."" He finds that redistribution is one of the first issues pushed off of the agenda. This is largely in line with the work of a group of political scientists who find that policy stagnation has reduced the ability of government's to respond to rising inequality.Further, as I've noted, the agendas of the poor and rich are different, the poor and middle class tend to be more concerned with issues of redistribution like poverty and the minimum wage. Legislatures are increasingly stretched, and they rely more on pre-packaged bills by organizations like ALEC and turn to interest groups and lobbyists to help analyze and draft legislation.Lee Drutman has made this argument forcefully and frequently, noting, ""The entire House and Senate combined spend less on staff ($2 billion a year) than corporations spend on lobbying ($2.6 billion a year)."" The result is obvious: economic inequality only further strengthens the power of the already wealthy, creating a self-fueling cycle. As Drutman notes, the solution is equally obvious: bolster legislative capacity by increasing staff size and salaries. At the state level, we need professionalized state legislatures. (While part-time citizen legislators sound good, the research suggeststhey do a bad job representing their constituents.)The literature on inequality and democracy continues to expand dramatically. There's been increasing research at the state level, as well as new studies examining race, gender and the interactions of race and class. Further, studies are increasingly honing in on the donor class, differential turnout and rising economic inequality as explanations for this unequal representation.The solutions are simple to imagine, but more difficult to put into practice. Unions promote both economic and political equality -- they both push up the wages of workers and mobilize politically for the interests of the middle class. Automatic voter registration would boost turnout, and combined with non-partisan get-out-the-vote operations offers the most viable route to boosting turnout among low-propensity individuals. Disclosure of campaign donations, robust public financing of electionsand limits on the ability of corporations and wealthy individuals to influence elections could alleviate the pervasive influence of money over politics.As it happens, policies to reduce the power and influence of the elite class over politics have broad public support, across all parties. (The charts above show net support, meaning I subtracted the share of people against the policy from the share in support.) The problem, of course, is getting the politicians already under the sway of powerful interests to pass laws limiting their influence over politics.This piece originally appeared on Salon. "

His views on the region went completely unchallenged in the absence of a counter-argument, and due to the format of his session, members of the audience were not able to ask questions or intervene.However, one must admit that Zarif's ability to twist facts is phenomenal! Indeed, had there been an award at Davos for ""Spin Doctor of the Year,"" then he would have won it... hands down!Iran's FM made it seem like Tehran was the region's cuddly teddy bear who has been desperately trying to reconcile with Saudi Arabia, which he naturally portrayed as the ""big bad wolf.""Frankly, I wasn't sure if Zarif was being serious or joking when he stressed in front of the WEF audience of global movers and shakers that his country is a firm believer in diplomacy as a means of resolving conflicts.If this is the case, then what on earth is the Iranian Quds Force (or paramilitary terrorist groups affiliated to it) doing in Iraq and Syria? In fact, this elite Revolutionary Guard Unit is so focused on destabilizing Iran's Arab neighbors that I honestly suggest it should be renamed the ""Anywhere-but-Quds Brigade.""Furthermore, if the Iranian regime is truly such a peace-loving dove, then perhaps it should consider withdrawing from the three UAE islands it still occupies, stop supporting the murderous Assad regime which has overseen the killing of 200 thousand people and stop backing Yemen's Houthi militias which staged a coup against the legitimate government of President Hadi.Of course, this was a fair comment as the Saudi participation was perceived to be mostly business-oriented. The delegation -- which consisted of a few ministers, government officials and prominent businessmen, as well as a number of princes and individuals coming in their personal capacity -- wasn't seen by many to reflect the size, prominence and change happening in the kingdom.Zarif went on to stress that this attack was officially condemned and that the perpetrators will be prosecuted. However, he -- unsurprisingly -- didn't dwell much into how this attack was allowed to happen in the first place under a regime which otherwise wouldn't allow a mosquito to freely move without permission! Excuse me? How was Riyadh supposed to act when - on top of all the aggression mentioned above -- the Iranian regime sat back and watched its thugs attack and set fire to the Saudi embassy in Tehran?Zarif also dwelled on how Saudi Arabia's defense expenditure is far greater than Iran's -- yet he failed to recognize that this is a natural result of Tehran meddling with the region left, right and center. At the end of the day, Saudi Arabia would also prefer to spend more of its money on development -- however with Houthi missiles coming in from the south and Iran bragging from the north about becoming an empire and occupying Arab cities, what else could Riyadh have done?Naturally, not everyone in Davos bought the Iranian narrative, however almost everyone I met said one thing: ""we wish the Saudis were here to be able to tell their side of the story.""Of course, this was a fair comment as the Saudi participation was indeed low key compared to size, prominence and change happening in the kingdom: a few ministers, government officials and prominent businessmen, as well as a number of princes and individuals coming in their personal capacity.However, I understand that behind closed doors FM Zarif was taken to task on his country's shameful stance on Syria by a former senior Saudi official. Unfortunately, only a handful of people -- and no media -- saw that.Now, the kingdom is not without its faults and certainly not above criticism. However, until it is fairly represented and publicly present at such important global events, this will only mean that Iran can continue getting away with spinning the truth and Zarif's politically incorrect fairy tales will prevail.*This blog post was originally posted in Al Arabiya English.
