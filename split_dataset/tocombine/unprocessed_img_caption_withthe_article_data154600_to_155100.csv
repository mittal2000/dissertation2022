0,TRAVEL,May Is the Best Month in Paris,"Sidonie Sawyer, Contributor
French-American Features and Travel writer ♫.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/may-is-the-best-month-in_us_5b9d2a84e4b03a1dcc8514ac,"Tourists in May in Paris can have a great time -- hotels are cheaper, lines are shorter, and restaurant waiters are nicer.",2013-05-17,French national flag flying in front of a Government building in Paris.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d2a8426000036007fc23a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"From the East Coast, I flew to London, so the travel time from the USA to Europe is fairly short, and I love taking the train between London and Paris (takes only two and a half hours). My ears kept on popping as the Eurostar fast train rushed through tunnels before heading to open space. As the bullet train between London and Paris sped through the English countryside, rolling hills of greens undulated, as black and white fat cows barely look in the direction of the train. It's been said that the speeding train is so fast, the lazy cows can't follow it with their gaze, and gave up trying.Tourists in May in Paris can have a great time -- hotels are cheaper, lines are shorter, and restaurant waiters are nicer. When I first climbed the Eiffel Tower, I stood in line like everyone else, but soon realized that you don't have to wait for hours if you go up the thousands of stairs, you get a great exercise, it's a nice challenge, and you can gloat about it later.This time around, I decided that I would finally ""do the catacombs'' (faire les catacombes), the secret network of underground streets running underneath each street of Paris. The réseau has been open and shut sporadically throughout the years, as many rave parties have doomed it to obscurity for months at the time. And then there were the famed rats. I guess that was my main fear. The only public entrance to the Catacombes is from under the mighty lion sculpture on the Place Denfert Rochereau, in the 14th arrondissement. It is a very alternative experience, to say the least.Let me explain the arrondissements.The city proper of Paris has 20 arrondissements, or districts, numbered from 1 to 20, with the first one at the heart of Paris, and the other ones ""snailing"" out clockwise, with the 20th ending at the lower right hand side of a map, as seen from the sky. Parisians traditionally use their numbers to position themselves in the city. For example one would say: ""I live in the 5th arrondissement, but I work in the 16th.""The city was once Roman and called Lutèce. Some remnants of stone walls and many entrance arches to the enclosed city are still there, proofs of the highly skilled Roman architects. Each of the 20 districts has its own mayor, city hall, firefighters, and all the attributes of a small town. And yet, it's still the City of Paris.So Paris is a snail, in many ways, including traffic-wise. What is called the embouteillages (traffic jams) have to be one of the most annoying thing about the capital. Luckily, the subway and bus networks are amazing, fast, mostly modern, and fairly cheap. The Métro is easy to use, even if you don't speak a word of French, you can follow the routes on graphic maps located in every station.In Paris, scooters are king. The queens are the rented bicycles Velipeds. The very popular program took off almost instantly among Parisians, business people, shopping moms, or students alike. You stick your credit card in a machine and for a few Euros, you get a bike for an hour or less, or more, that you can return at any terminal station, strategically placed every few blocks in the entire city. You get charged only for the time you use the bicycle. If you don't return it though, you're in trouble, meaning the system will charge late fees directly into your credit card. The bikes are everywhere and they even have their own special lanes in some streets, sharing with buses and taxis, sometimes a scary proposition. The bikes have an internal mechanism that makes them a little heavy, so it's hard to climb up to Montmartre, or some other steep hill, if you're not a regular biking practitioner.The majestic opera house of Paris, the Palais Garnier, is one of the city's most beautiful landmarks. You can take a tour and visit the inside of the opera house, with its grand foyer, majestic staircases, imposing and graceful architectural details. Guides will even tell you about the persistent legend of the underneath lake and the famous phantom. Even most Parisians don't know that the avenue de L'Opéra, leading to the opera house, is not lined with trees like most avenues of Paris because its master architect, Charles Garnier, did not want anything to block the view of the building, so he instructed the urban planners of the time to never plant anything along the way leading to his structure. To this day, the city respects that ordinance.Every public or private museum in Paris has at least one day, or one evening, each week that offers free entrance. Some have a no-charge-ever policy for students, the unemployed, or kids. Even the popular Musée du Louvre has days and times when the entry fee is waived. It is possible to visit most of the museums for free if you plan well. And of course the hundreds of private art galleries around the city are always free to visit.Besides eating, walking in Paris is my favorite thing to do. You can go up a hill on a cobblestoned street and find a cathedral; you can pace an oak alley among tombstones, climb mounds of soft grass leading to a temple. Every neighborhood has a story to tell, and Paris being such an old lady, most street have grand facades, courtyards, gardens, Roman remnants, bizarre adornments and relics of past history. Paris has a lot of parks and greenery; about 40 locations are named gardens.One of the charming ways to walk among flowers is to follow the Promenade Plantée, a 3-mile long green lane in the 12th arrondissement, that follows an abandoned railway line, similar to the High Line in New York City. My favorite place is the Parc des Buttes-Chaumont, a huge public space on top of a hill in the 19th arrondissement that offers great views of the city below. Besides up and down paths, the park has a temple, grottos that echo, and an artificial lake.The sidewalks enduring annoyances (aka doggies' poop) of Paris are still a big problem and it will take generations before Parisians carry little plastic bags to put away their dogs' affairs. So un-chic. Parisians consider it fair game if their pooch simply goes outside. The month of May in Paris is almost always the traditional time for strikes. Perhaps because the weather gets better and it's that much easier to walk outside in protest with fair temperature -- perhaps, too, because as the air gets hotter, so do tempers. Many social revolutions have started in May in France, from students protests to truck drivers airing dissatisfaction, from train conductors wanting more money, to street sweepers needing more benefits. A wonderful thing in Paris in the summer (July-August) is how late the day lingers. Until 10 or 11 p.m., you are still outside in daylight. Having dinner at terraces when the light is still warm is amazing. You can catch a late movie and come out before it's dark outside. And in the western part of France, in Brittany, in June, the daylight stretches all the way to midnight.La fin."

But 76 countries still criminalize homosexuality, and LGBT and HIV+ travelers still face additional scrutiny, security and safety risks all over the globe. Thousands of us have watched former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's historic speech to the United Nations Human Rights Council in December 2011, demonstrating America's commitment to the advancement of LGBT rights. (And if you haven't, stop right now and do so!)As America's most senior government officials talk the talk, its Bureau of Consular Affairs is walking the walk for LGBT travelers, making sure that U.S. citizens have access to accurate and current LGBT-specific information when planning overseas travel. The Department has debuted an LGBT Travel Information page, linked right from the home page of the Department's official travel information website, www.travel.state.gov. And the Bureau of Consular Affairs regularly updates information about the legal and social climate for LGBT travelers to the country-specific travel information page provided for every country around the globe where there are criminal penalties or concerns. In February, we at ManAboutWorld were invited to participate in the first-ever roundtable discussion at the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Consular Affairs, kicking off their Smart Traveler Day, designed to support the Department's ongoing efforts to keep U.S. citizens informed and connected to the latest travel information, and to emphasize the assistance they provide to U.S. citizens traveling overseas.The Department's Office of Overseas Citizens Services is committed to making sure that U.S. Embassy staff are prepared to assist LGBT U.S. citizens who find themselves in trouble while out of the country -- with the sensitivity, understanding and confidentiality that may be required.

The first three are from personal experience. The next two are questions that you need to just trust me on -- don't ask.,2013-05-16,Profile of expectant mother's hands on bump with countryside background.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d2b66240000300094f82b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I have been pregnant three times and delivered three babies. All girls. Now they are teenagers -- I have no idea where the time went but those are thoughts for another post. Each time I went through my pregnancies, I gained in the neighborhood of 30 pounds. By today's standards, that seems to be a pretty average amount of weight. (In 1965, the year I was born, my mother was only allowed to gain two pounds per month for a total of 18 pounds. She was so afraid of getting yelled at by her doctor that she would often fast before visits. Yeah, not a good idea.) I know some women gain more and some gain less. It is not about comparing. I promise you, Kim Kardashian, it is not about comparing, so don't listen to what people say. But I will tell you that if I gained 30 pounds, it looked like I gained 100. I carried huge. It was in my face, my arms, my belly, my butt, my chest, just about everywhere. Needless to say, you could liken me to a whale, a house, or an elephant. Yeah, that big. Today's post is about what not to say to a pregnant woman. The first three are from personal experience. The next two are questions that you need to just trust me on -- don't ask.1. ""Ma'am, do you think you could get off the ride?"" This question is not a common catch phrase so it deserves some explanation. I was pregnant with my second daughter -- four days away from giving birth. I took my oldest daughter to a town festival. She was nearly 3-years-old and eyeing a little train-ride that chugged around the park. I bought us two tickets and we hopped on the train. We were holding hands and giggling, waiting for the train to pull out of the station. But there was a hold up. The train wouldn't move. The conductor got off the train and checked the engine, before attempting to start her up again. Still no action. Again, and a bit agitated this time, the conductor got off the train, fidgeted with another button or two, then got back on to pull us out of Grand Central. Still no movement. Finally, he got off the ride and walked down the line of cars. He took one look at me and said, ""Ma'am, do you think you could get off the ride?"" My eyes got wide, my brain a mix of terror (I can't leave my daughter on the ride alone) and embarrassment (I am not big enough to stop a train from moving). My daughter gave me a nod and a smile. ""It's okay, Mommy,"" she said. I stepped off the ride. The conductor started up the train, and magically it moved, with a chugga chugga choo choo, around the park. I cried. I hope no other pregnant woman hears those ten words, strung together in just that way, while experiencing the same devastating results.2. ""Where do you buy clothes big enough to fit you?"" This time I was pregnant with my first daughter. Can you imagine? A real, live person actually asked me that. I was at work, putting change in the vending machine, trying to buy myself a Snickers bar (I was hungry) when the offender spewed out those words. Honestly, I don't remember my answer. If I know me, and I do, I probably smiled and giggled and avoided any kind of an answer. My answer I don't remember. Her question I will never forget.3. ""I can tell you are having a girl because your nose got really wide.""  True story. Someone said this to me. I spent the remainder of my pregnancy staring at my deformed nose in the mirror, wondering how much wider it would get. And did its width really determine the sex of my baby? Apparently it did.4. ""How much do you weigh now?"" While nobody asked me this personally, just think about it. If you wouldn't ask this question of someone who isn't pregnant (and I am going out on a limb here thinking you wouldn't) then don't ask it of someone who is. You can think it. Wonder about it. Noodle it over. But for the love of God, DON'T ASK IT.5. ""Can I touch your belly?"" No. See above answer. If you wouldn't ask this question of someone who isn't pregnant (and I am going out on a limb here thinking you wouldn't) then don't ask it of someone who is. It is awkward and stalkerish. Keep your hands to yourself.When you step near a pregnant woman do me, and pregnant women everywhere, a favor -- think before you speak."

NOLA's French Quarter is both a garishly pantomimed tourist attraction and the genuine article: a place where cavernous atria of T-Shirt shops and Frozen Daiquiri arcades double as midnight concert halls for street musicians so talented that even Billy Joel would wonder, 'Man, what are you doin' here?'Recently, I found myself back at a fine hotel in the Crescent City. It was 10 days ago during JazzFest. My 20th Jazzfest in a row -- not counting the one I missed -- and the five-day flurry, as described in its very own chapter in my Foodie Road Trip Guide ""A Fork on the Road: 400 Cities, 1 Stomach,"" was frenetic as usual:  Threaten, cajole and drag The Traveling Diva out of bed @ 9am Café du Monde @ 10am Fairgounds by 11am Music, Food, Ridiculous Fest Fun until 7pm Dinner with cabal of drunken, yet appropriately hilarious friends, at 9pm Live music in one of 20 great clubs til 3am REPEAT X 4Once a year for 20 consecutive years -- except the one I missed -- I come to this sticky Afro-French-Caribbean-Indian-Anglo Port to gorge myself in a cultural hedonism so pungent and soulful that for weeks afterwards, everyplace other place I am seems like a bland version of Orlando by comparison.Music mavens from around the Globe descend on the bayou every spring to experience NOLA's carefully curated voodoo mash-up of American music, food and hospitality. Everything about New Orleans during Jazzfest Goes To Eleven. The jamming is louder. The musical combinations are tastier. The thunderstorms are drenchier. Like visiting Lake Placid during the Olympics - or Disneyland... any day of the year -- the whole population is putting on The Show. Also like Disney, the folks and fabric of the touristy French Quarter between Canal and Esplanade, are well aware of their mystique -- and do all they can to monetize their decadently swoozy 90 square block adult theme park. And ever the dutiful fan boy, my posse and I return each year to consume the cultural gumbo presented to us in easily digestible weekend chunks.But not today. Today is just an ordinary Saturday. No Festivals. No events. No emergencies. Just a ""normal"" weekend in America's least normal City. Its today again. After only 10 days away, I'm back in NOLA for a quick weekend show. I arrive a day early to enjoy a rare day off away from home. Alone, all day, without a Fest to ingest or friends with which to roam, I decide to spend my empty day filling up on the ""Real"" French Quarter... while wondering if there is, or ever has been, any such place.In order to truly experience the City, I leave my Bluetooth cocoon behind -- no headphones for walking music. No cell phone for aimless conversations on my aimless walk. I wondered if after Katrina, the City, out of necessity, had descended into parody of itself to keep the tourism dollars flowing. So without the glitter of headliners like Springsteen and Fleetwood Mac, I wanted to experience the sights, smells and tastes of the Quarter, circa 2013. I wondered if the New Orleans I'd come to 'know' over the last two decades - except the year I missed - was the real New Orleans at all.Walking up Royal from Canal Street, the first thing, of course, is the music. Sounds wash over my ears like a crashing tide. The master mix changes every 10 feet; Zydeco down that alley, Brass in front of the 8th District Police Station, Louis Prima jumping out of the Fleur Girl gift shop. Busking, a corporatized ""attraction"" at such well meaning knock-offs as Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade...and every outside Mall in America with 'charming roving musicians,' is authentically alive and well here below sea level. To be sure, some of the musicians are veteran barkers, as skillful at working the crowd as they are their own axes. But they're not aspiring musicians, they're not snarky hipsters grinding ironic tunes for an unknowing gaggle of pikers. They are proud professionals, young and ancient, alabaster and inked, proudly filling their city with a nectar that only ferments here. And unlike anywhere else I've been, to survive, the players start at good and get better from there. Marginal musicians simply can not make a living here, too much talent in too small a place.But the topography of the Quarter is just the canvas. It remains as it has been, mostly, for over 200 years. It's the music -- the application of human energy and inspiration against wood and metal -- that is alive and new. Even a weathered chestnut like ""Georgia on my Mind"" reveals new thrills as these unsung artists throw paint in the middle of the street.And I can't sit and listen without some Café au Lait and a melty Muffuletta. Wouldn't be right. The savory blend of olives, creamy cheese and salty meat -- all the excess grease having long ago deliciously soaked into the airy, catcher's mitt sized bun -- melts in my mouth like... like... a giant sandwich. Next to Louis Prima and Sam Butera, it's the tastiest Italian legacy here. What's the 'authentic' NOLA Mufuletta? The last one you ate. Like gumbo, each spot slaps their own savor on this traditional meal. Hot or cold, hand-made or store-bought olive spread, they're all worth taking the time to enjoy. Which, unlike during the frenzied pace of my Fest Trips, I'm doing today.And as I slouch into this bench, morsels of all the conversations swirling around the music pepper my ears.Two chuckling, soon to be Fathers-in-Law trail a straggle of groomsmen through Jackson Square as they bicker about the fastest way to Frenchman Street.The big man in the Trumpet/Tuba duo in front of the church plays a Dixieland version of Hank Williams' ""My Bucket's got a Hole in it,"" before explaining that the lyrics are more than a metaphor... by passing around his bucket during his solo. I listen as the breathless 22-year old girl from Kansas standing behind me explains why she is so in love with her new boyfriend who's brought her home for the first time to meet the family this weekend at his boyhood home on the West Bank. She talks, barely taking the time to breathe, through the entire song, her gush of newly discovered love unintentionally riding the melody in almost perfect syncopation. I'm full. The sun's doing down, and as I turn to walk back to my hotel, I steal a glimpse of this tableau of strangers that until now, I'd only seen with my ears. The girl is slender, pale and glowing in a simple farm dress and knit cap. On the bench behind me sit her incongruent confidants -- two ancient black men hanging on her every word. One is dressed impeccably in a grey suit, royal blue tie and matching pocket square. The other, in dreadlocks and a rumpled tracksuit, cradles a dented sax in his lap like a baby. They both wear hats that tell those who know, they too, are players on the Street. They gaze at her with faces filled with wonder and wisdom, another contradiction. Reliving while maybe coveting that magical moment in life where nothing else matters, everything is clear, and the unbroken road stretches out straight as an arrow in the headlights of your band new car. When all you need is a full tank of gas and a fresh hotel room somewhere down the road.Authentic soul in a cartoon city. Thankfully, it's still available -- at least here it is. All you gotta do is unplug and listen.
