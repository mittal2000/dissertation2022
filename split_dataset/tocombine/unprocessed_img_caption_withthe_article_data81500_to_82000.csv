Later that month, the death of unarmed black teen Michael Brown threw these deep tensions into sharp relief, as one community mourned and took action to protest the police violence that had characterized a building #BlackLivesMatter movement. August 9 marks one year since 18-year-old Brown was shot and killed by former Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson. Scenes of the community mourning Brown's death, subsequent protests, and a militarized police presence in the small Missouri city inspired anger and action across the nation, which would play out in reactions to cases of excessive, sometimes lethal police force against black men and women in the year to come.One year later, the legacy of Ferguson's transformation blankets the small city. Some signs are visible. Others are imperceptible. Reuters photographer Adrees Latif photographed the neighborhood streets, government buildings, schools and local businesses shortly after Michael Brown's death, returning this summer to photograph the same places nearly a year later.As a community rebuilds and markings of grief and anger fade, Ferguson's streets and buildings may look unchanged. But as these 11 images show, they will never be the same. "
1,POLITICS,El Paso Is Fighting To Reclaim The Border’s Soul,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/el-paso-juarez-border-fight_us_55c77b2de4b0f73b20b9aa81,"For the first time since 9/11, local leaders from both sides of the border ran side by side.",2015-08-09,"<p>Standing high on Rim Road against the Rockies, El Paso and Juarez spread across the desert below. </p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55c77dca1700006e00566ffa.jpeg?cache=KEieXOcThH&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"EL PASO -- Driving along El Paso’s Rim Road, which hugs the southern tip of the Rockies, it’s difficult to tell where Texas ends and Mexico begins. Looking down on the town below, a thick, black line marks the desert sand ahead in the distance, running over a hill into the emptiness beyond. It’s a fence, the very visible border that divides El Paso, Texas, and Juarez, Mexico. Behind it curves the Rio Grande, a skeleton of its former self used primarily for irrigation once it hits Texas.Mention that fence and you’ll have Rep. Beto O’Rourke (D-Texas) in your ear. The fence, for O’Rourke, symbolizes all that’s wrong with outside perceptions of the border and what it’s like to live just across the river from Mexico.“I’m really embarrassed by the fence,” O’Rourke told The Huffington Post. “We are the largest truly binational community in the world and our connection is our strength. Any attempt to divide that or separate it, especially with this awful fence the East Germans would be ashamed of, is the wrong way to go.”While Republican presidential hopefuls debated Thursday night for the first time, arguing for more security on the border, and a higher wall, O’Rourke prepped for the highlight of the U.S.-Mexico summit he put together this week: a 10K race looping from El Paso into Juarez, and ending atop the Paso Del Norte Port of Entry.O’Rourke aims to send a message that the border is far different than the image painted by candidates.The race, held Saturday morning, was meant to signal all that has changed for the two border towns. O’Rourke, as well as local nonprofits, entrepreneurs and philanthropists, hope the race will help to redefine and reclaim the region they call home. It was the first time such a race has been able to be held since the Sept. 11 attacks, which ramped up security at the border.The three-day summit, which concluded Saturday, involved cabinet officials from the administrations of U.S. President Barack Obama and Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto; lawmakers from Mexico and the U.S.; the mayors of El Paso and Juarez; and the head of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The atmosphere in the two border towns throughout the summit was a far cry from that on the campaign trail.“People want to see the wall built,” Ohio Gov. John Kasich said Thursday during the Republican presidential primary debate hosted by Fox News.Business mogul Donald Trump took it even further when asked to defend his charges that the Mexican government is sending over “rapists” to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who called his comments horrible.“This was not a subject that was on anybody’s mind until I said it,” Trump said. “The fact is, since then, many killings, murders, crimes, drugs pouring across the border are money going out and drugs coming in. And I said it, we need to build a wall and it has to be built quickly and I don’t mind having a big, beautiful door in that wall so people can come into this country legally. But we need, Jeb, to build a wall. We need to keep illegals out.”Bush, on the other hand, stood by his comments that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants come to the U.S. out of “love” and because they “have no other option.”Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, like Trump, pushed for a more secure border, as did Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas). Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), who is also running for the nomination, offered a bit more, arguing that the majority of people coming across the border are not from Mexico, but Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, before adding that the U.S. needs a fence because “people feel like we are being taken advantage of.”The residents of El Paso and Juarez tell a very different story.Empowered by a corrupt law enforcement system in Juarez, drug cartels and gangs killed, kidnapped, robbed and extorted many, leaving the city in ruin until residents, mainly the affluent and organized, pushed back.Even during the height of the violence that plagued Juarez from 2007 to 2011, El Paso remained one of the safest cities in the U.S.During the destruction, El Paso was relatively untouched, instead witnessing an influx of businesses and residents that left Juarez. Now that Juarez is returning to normal, some who left are returning home. Those who have stayed are experiencing a boom in business in El Paso, which is growing every day alongside the new opportunities offered by a safer Juarez.Despite the violence, Juarez’s maquila industry -- large assembly and manufacturing operations -- didn’t falter. Workers were left alone and the massive plants owned by companies like Johnson & Johnson, Honeywell, Delphi and Flextronics were not harmed.Though there has been a significant drop in violence in Juarez, a stigma remains, and it damages outsiders’ views of what living on the border is like.“I don’t think the border region is sufficiently well understood outside of the border region, whether it’s in D.C. or in Mexico City,” said William Duncan, U.S. deputy chief of mission in Mexico. “Over time you are going to see the border as a barrier become less relevant to our lives.”Whether one resident of El Paso stopped traveling to Juarez during the violence and another didn’t, or a native of Juarez moved away and another stayed, they all agree on one thing: Juarez is safer, and El Paso never stopped being safe.Lydia Nesbitt is one of the people who never stopped working in Juarez during the violence. During the height of the turmoil, she worked at the Universidad Autónoma de Ciudad Juarez as the director of industry relations, creating ties between students and major businesses through research, internships and continuing education. To Nesbitt, Juarez is now safer than the American cities of Chicago and Detroit.Nesbitt now works for the Borderplex Alliance, an organization dedicated to bringing native El Pasoans that left for school or work back to the border region to help spur change and innovation. Many are already coming back, and some have never left. The reason: Texas exports more goods than any other state in the nation and El Paso firms exported roughly $21 billion in merchandise abroad just last year. Despite rapidly increasing commerce, trade and transportation of goods between the U.S. and Mexico, problems arise because of the way the border and those living in surrounding cities are viewed. At times, outside politicians have argued for militarization of the border, which would only hurt businesses, the economy of both cities, and the regular traffic of residents who work and go to school across the border. Some 600 to 1,000 kids legally cross the Paso Del Norte Bridge from Juarez to El Paso to go to school every day, according to Customs and Border Protection. And that’s only one bridge out of the four international bridges that enter into El Paso.It’s a way of life for the cities and additional Border Patrol agents wouldn’t help, residents say. It’s Border Protection officers that are needed to expedite the flow of traffic and secure the legal ports that thousands cross from Juarez into El Paso. (Agents are those in green uniforms scattered across the vast desert along the border; officers are in blue, manning the thousands that legally cross at bridges and entry ports.)It’s for those reasons that when O’Rourke took office in 2012, beating out incumbent Democrat Silvestre Reyes in the primary, he decided to change the focus of the U.S.-Mexico summit that Reyes had held annually.The summit -- once a gathering of law enforcement leaders and only U.S. lawmakers and administration officials -- initially did not invite anyone from the Mexican side. The focus: security. At the last conference Reyes sponsored, guests included Raytheon, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and officials from the Drug Enforcement Administration and Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.To hear local businesses, city and patrol leaders, and Mexican senators and cabinet officials tell it, O’Rourke is helping push dialogue toward reclaiming the border, and what it means to live along it.O’Rourke joked that during prior conferences, American officials talked amongst themselves about “security, and security, and security.”It’s a matter of deciding, O’Rourke argued, “who defines the U.S.-Mexico relationship.”O’Rourke said the question will come down to if the U.S. wants the border and its nearby communities to be defined by those “responsible” for or residing in the area, like Mexican government leaders and American secretaries, or by “a reality television show star.”In an effort to gain control, and awareness, O’Rourke ran through downtown El Paso on Saturday, into Juarez, and through its streets -- streets that try but cannot hide the last remnants from a time of violence, but also show signs of growing life.The only indication that you had crossed the border into another country was the Paso Del Norte Bridge, which had Border Protection officers on either side, helping move the race along. In both El Paso and Juarez people cheered, one shouting, “Reunited and it feels so good.”The loop passed the new Triple-A Chihuahua baseball stadium in El Paso -- a point of pride for the city -- and a towering cathedral in Juarez. Many mentioned over and over how “historic” it was that the race was the first one of its kind since 9/11.The some 1,000 people who ran the 10K mounted the final hill by ascending the Paso Del Norte Bridge to cross the finish right on the border line. With one foot in Juarez, the other in El Paso, they paid little if any attention to the security presence and the fence in the distance splitting the countries in two.“I am certain that in my lifetime the fence will come down,” O’Rourke said after the race. “And we will look back on it and realize that was a big mistake.”"

""Make some noise for my baby father,"" she told the crowd, who went berserk.Minaj and the 28-year-old rapper, whose real name is Robert Rihmeek Williams, have been dating since around December 2014 and seem to enjoy playing guessing games with the public. In April, Minaj posted a photo of herself wearing a heart-shaped ring on her finger, sparking engagement rumors the couple neither confirmed nor denied for more than a month. Minaj then cleared the air in a cover story for The Fader, telling the magazine, ""[Our relationship] is definitely real, but it ain't really time to get married yet.""It's hard to know if Minaj was being serious when she called Meek Mill her ""baby father,"" but we'd guess that she wasn't, judging from the emoji-laden tweet she posted following her show, early Sunday morning: A request for comment to Minaj's rep was not immediately returned.

The initial invasion of the Gallipoli peninsula had occurred in two principal locations: at the very end of the peninsula at Cape Helles and at a small cove, since renamed Anzac cove, about a quarter of the way up the peninsula on the Aegean side. The cove was almost directly opposite the Narrows at Canakkale where the Ottomans had placed heavy artillery and an extensive series of minefields to prevent Allied ships from proceeding further up the Turkish straits.The landings at Anzac Cove had gone nowhere, with the Australian and New Zealand troops unable to advance in the face of murderous fire from Turkish infantry entrenched in the heights looking down on the landing beach. British and French forces at Cape Helles had attempted to advance up the peninsula. While their beachhead was more extensive, they too failed to make appreciable progress, and what little forward advance was achieved came at a high cost in dead and wounded. Allied and Ottoman Positions in Gallipoli, August 1915 The August Offensive was designed to break through to the Turkish lines on the Sari Bair ridge, which overlooked Anzac cove, then drive across the narrowest portion of the Gallipoli Peninsula trapping Ottoman forces between Allied troops in the south and the Anzac forces. In addition, the advance would have allowed Anzac Forces to outflank the Ottoman fortifications at Canakkale and cut them off from supplies and reinforcement.The first phase of the operation began on August 6, with a new landing at Suvla Bay, approximately five miles north of the current Anzac position. Simultaneously, Anzac forces launched an attempt to breakout from their position by beginning a new drive to the northeast into the rugged country parallel to the Sari Bair ridge. The plan was to link up with the British forces landing at Suvla Bay and outflank the Ottoman forces by capturing the high ground behind them further up on the Sari Bair ridge. Anzac forces were further supported by the British 13th Division and a number of other Brigade formations.  Turkish Soldiers Captured During the Landing at Suvla BayThree new British divisions would carry out the landings at Suvla Bay: the 10th Irish Division, the 11th (Northern) Division and the 13th (Western) Division. These divisions were considered ""New Army"" in that they had been created from new recruits following the virtual annihilation of the British Expeditionary Force that had been dispatched to France in August 1914. They were untested in battle and had received only the most rudimentary training. In addition two Territorial Army Divisions, the 53rd (Welsh) Division and the 54th (East Anglian) Division were to provide reinforcement. Tasked primarily for home defense, these territorial divisions were better trained but equally untested in battle. In addition there was also one division of dismounted yeomanry, the 2nd Mounted Division. The yeomanry were cavalry units of the Territorial Army that were being deployed as an infantry division. In the meantime, Allied Forces at Cape Helles staged an attack on an isolated farm known as Krithia Vineyard in the hope of drawing Ottoman troops to the south and away from the Sari Bair ridge. The diversionary attack failed to draw any significant Ottoman troops.  British Beachhead at Suvla Bay, August 1915 The landing at Suvla Bay was a disaster. None of the troops had received any training in mounting amphibious operations. Landing at night, many of the boats ran aground on sand bars forcing the men to disembark into the surf and wade, in some cases as much as 200 yards, ashore. There was an absence of reliable reconnaissance or maps of the landing area. Many troops became intermingled and officers, who traveled in separate craft, became separated from their units. Nothing had been learned from the disastrous landings at Anzac cove four months before. Little forward progress was made and British forces suffered 1,600 casualties during the first day from sniper file and artillery bombardment from the high ground overlooking the bay. Attempts to seize the high ground above the landing zone proved ineffective. British forces were reinforced by the 53rd Division on August 9 and the 54th Division on August 10, but by then heavy Ottoman reinforcement had matched the initial British advantage in troop strength.   Anzac Troops Advancing Against Ottoman Positions Along the Sari Bari Ridge, August 1915On August 15, the Commander of the Allied Forces in Gallipoli, General Sir Ian Hamilton, replaced the British Commander at Suvla Bay, Lt. General Sir Frederick Stopford, and a number of his subordinate commanders. Lt General Sir Julian Byng was transferred from France to assume control of the operation. There were a number of repeated attempts to break through the Ottoman lines above Suvla Bay and to link up with the Anzac force attempting to break out from Anzac cove between August 20 and the 29. Initially, all of these attempts failed.  Allied Troops Being Evacuated from Gallipoli, January 1916By the end of the month, however, Allied forces had manage to gain control of Hill 60 creating a solid front line from Suvla Bay to Anzac Cove. While the new front line represented a significant improvement over the previous Anzac position, it fell far short of cutting off the southern portion of the peninsula. The line represented the furthest advance of the operation and was the last pitched battle of the Gallipoli campaign. Five months later Allied forces withdrew bringing the Gallipoli campaign to an inglorious end."
