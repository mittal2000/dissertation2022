0,TRAVEL,All the World Is a Stage: Will the UAE Play a Part?,"Dayna Steele, Contributor
Rock Talk business speaker, host of The Rock Business TV serie...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/uae-play-a-part_us_5b9db983e4b03a1dcc8c0cba,"There was one instance where I knew I had come dangerously close to crossing an invisible line. I innocently asked a question of the assembled tourists and international workers known as expatriates, or expats. The chill I felt was stunning, and I immediately realized what I had done.",2013-12-19,"Skyscrapers stand on the city skyline beyond a jet skier passing close to the shore in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, on Monday, Aug. 12, 2013. As Dubai recovers from its slump caused by the global financial meltdown, Abu Dhabi is expanding faster, according to figures from their governments published last month and building projects and tourism mean the non-oil economy has overtaken Dubai's entire output, the data showed.

With that last-minute instruction, before I hung up to board my aircraft for a very long journey, I knew this was going to be very different than any other vacation stored in my memory.If it were not for the common site of robe attire, abaya for women, and dishdasha for men, you could be in any major metropolitan location. The two large UAE cities, Abu Dhabi and Dubai, are beautiful metropolitan areas and the Emiratis are gracious hosts. The cities are bustling with business and commerce as well as with great restaurants, fabulous hotels, and world-class entertainment. You can even snow ski in a mall.Yet despite all this glitz and glamour, there is always a very faint feeling of tenseness and unease knowing the locals are watching you. It is definitely a location you do not visit without a little personal research on the rules and customs you should adhere to strictly.Though I never had any problems while visiting, there was one instance where I knew I had come dangerously close to crossing an invisible line. A group of us got together early one evening for a rowdy happy hour. Yes, there are bars, and there is liquor in the UAE. Just the fact that we were being loud was a bit of a problem. Then I innocently asked a question of the assembled tourists and international workers known as expatriates, or expats. It went something like this:""I see all the construction and know there is a business plan to grow the area into the millions within a few years, with residents and tourists flocking to what you are now building. How can the Emiratis expect that to happen, expect to be considered a desirable destination by the rest of the world, if you can still be arrested for hugging in public, among other things?"" I asked.It was as if I had walked into a Twilight Zone episode -- I no longer existed. Every -- and I mean every -- person in our group stopped talking to me and turned away silently, either looking down at their phones or at some imaginary spot on the carpet. The chill I felt was stunning, and I immediately realized what I had done.If any of these temporary workers or tourists had given any credence to my query, and if a nearby Emirati had heard it and reported it, these new-found friends of mine could have been deported from the country immediately or, even worse, jailed like Shezanne (Shez) Cassim. Cassim is the Minnesota resident currently locked up at a high-security United Arab Emirates prison after posting a 19-minute comedy video parodying Abu Dhabi security. (It is a very safe area).It is sad to see the negative publicity the UAE is now receiving. The area is beautiful and, for the most part, the Emiratis are welcoming of all guests. However, this negative press is justified and it was inevitable. It is the answer to that question I posed late last year. If the UAE wants to play on the worldwide stage as a glittering super star, the remaining hardline Emiratis will have to follow the script the rest of the world has written.Note: I reached out to several expats as well as others who have visited for their comments on Cassim and these latest developments in the UAE. Not one would go on record with a comment for fear of reprisals in the country."
1,PARENTING,What My Daughter Learned from The Nutcracker,"Shannon Sutherland, Contributor

Before the show she cried because she wanted to be onstage NOW. After her part was done she cried because she wanted to go back on stage NOW.",2013-12-19,2013-12-19-1380106_10102502075462519_890291634_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-12-19-1380106_10102502075462519_890291634_n-thumb.jpg,"Last week, my daughter and I were in a production of The Nutcracker at The Joffrey Ballet School. It was exhausting, to say the least. We rehearsed twice a week for twp months and she had to stay up way past her bedtime for tech rehearsals and performances. Before the show she cried because she wanted to be onstage NOW. After her part was done she cried because she wanted to go back on stage NOW. It was also very hard to keep her quiet when the director was talking and when we were supposed to be frozen during the party scene. When we were onstage, I had to react to everything that was happening while keeping my toddler calm.I know what you're thinking; my 2-1/2-year-old didn't have to be in The Nutcracker. I am complaining about being tired from something I decided to do. I could have said no when she asked to be in a show. If she persisted, I could have ignored her and turned on the TV. It would have been much easier that way. My back still hurts from lugging her around Manhattan to and from rehearsal. So, why did I put myself in a situation that would cause my terrible 2-year-old to throw more temper tantrums than usual?Well, over the summer my daughter asked to be in a ""show."" Her daddy and I are both comedians, so that must be where she got the idea. I was thrilled when I found out her ballet school lets 2-year-olds participate in their production of The Nutcracker. She played a party baby in the party scene so she got to live out her dream of being in a show without having too much pressure. I was told if she cried I could take her offstage. It was a party scene, after all, and what 2-year-old doesn't act cranky at a party?My daughter loved the rehearsals. She made friends with the other dancers and talked about them non-stop. She walked to school singing the only verse from The Nutcracker she knew over and over again. Every night before bed she practiced her moves and asked when she got to go to another rehearsal. When it finally came time for opening night, she surprised me by being completely comfortable on stage.It was a great experience and I am so proud of my daughter. I know I am biased, but she was really cute in The Nutcracker. On the surface, that may look like the reason I dragged my daughter to all those rehearsals; so I could see her be her adorable little self onstage. And yes, it is a part of it, but a very small part of it. The real reason I let her be in a show at such a young age is because of the giant smile in the picture above. And why is she smiling, you ask? Am I holding a lollipop? A toy?Nope! She's smiling because she is wearing her special Nutcracker shirt and it has her name on the back. She's smiling because she made a ton of new friends while doing something really fun. She's smiling because she worked really hard for two months and now she finally gets to share her hard work with her family. She's smiling because she's proud of herself.As a mom, I often get bogged down with the day to day tasks of caring for my daughter. There are no perfect kids or mothers but I try to teach my daughter some of the more important lessons like listening, using her manners words, and that at the grocery store she shouldn't run around screaming gobble gobble like a turkey. But what I've found is that the most important thing I can teach her is to have pride in herself and her accomplishments.Most children who take ballet, don't grow up to become prima ballerinas but for me and many other parents who sign their toddlers up for classes that's not the point. For us, it's about letting our kids experience the joy that comes from hard work and doing something all by themselves.I have no idea if my daughter will want to be in The Nutcracker again next year. Her first show could also be her last or it could be the first in a lifetime of opening nights and curtain calls. Only time will tell. But no matter what she chooses to do with her life, I will always remember the enormous smile on her face after her first performance when she turned to me and screamed, ""I did it! I'm a dancer!"" because at the tender age of 2 she was able to experience the happiness that comes from pushing yourself and succeeding.This was previously published on PoopPeePuke.com"
2,HOME & LIVING,Pantone Color of the Year -- How to Decorate With Radiant Orchid,"Alessandra Wood, PhD, Contributor
Director of Style, Modsy",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pantone-color-of-the-year_us_5b9dbab6e4b03a1dcc8c1cee,"Treading between pink and purple, the Pantone color elicits strong feelings of both love and hate.",2013-12-19,2013-12-19-GrahamBrownNeonCityPrintedCanvasArt1.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-12-19-GrahamBrownNeonCityPrintedCanvasArt1-thumb.jpg,"The much awaited announcement of the 2014 Pantone Color of the Year came this month. Our Tastemaker decorators had mixed reactions to Radiant Orchid. Treading between pink and purple, the Pantone color elicits strong feelings of both love and hate.If you like to stay on trend with interior design, you might consider a few pops of Radiant Orchid. It can add warmth and feminine touches to your space. So what's the best way to incorporate it into your interior decor? My advice: unless you want to change your interiors next year, either use it sparingly in pieces anchored with classic forms, or go big and bold and don't look back. There is no middle ground here.Consider some small accessories for your bedroom, living room, or bathroom. A few great picks:Neon City, Graham and Brown, $49.99 Great art will always be in style. This piece is anchored with blues and greens that will keep it in style. A great accent for a living room or hallway.Silk Clock, All Modern, $49 The modern lines of this clock will keep it looking fresh even when Radiant Orchid is no longer the color of the year. Add it to your office or kitchen. Fuschia Throw, Jayson Home, $150 A little more on the fuschia side, this throw will add a bold pop of color to your living room. Pair it with navy blue and golds to keep it current. Agate Acrylic Tray, Shop Ten 25, $440; Snake Pillow, Shop Ten 25, $80 Shop Ten 25 has a great selection of accents in this color family. These accessories have an unexpected twist that will keep them fresh in the future.Looking to be a little more bold? With a color like this, you might as well go big or go home. Something I've noticed from years of studying design history: unexpected design transcends time, like the work of my favorite interior designer, Dorothy Draper. So maybe you'd rather not play it safe with this color. Here are some daring ways to use this hue:Haute House Chair, Horchow, $2459 Because the shade of this chair slants a little more towards purple and the chesterfield shape is incredibly classic, these will become defining features of your living room for years to come. They are bold and daring, and a perfect statement piece.1980s Wallpaper, Designer Wallcoverings Retro inspired, this wallpaper is certainly fearless. A great statement for a hallway, bathroom, office, or accent wall in your living room. Mysticism Bed, ABC Home, $3505.50 This might be as bold as it gets. Even finished in neutral upholstery, this oversized bed would make a statement, but it's especially daring in this shade. So, if you like the Pantone Color of the Year, why not add a few pops of Radiant Orchid to your space with minor accessories here and there. And if you love the new Pantone color, be bold and commit to it for a few years with some amazing statement pieces."
3,PARENTING,A 20-Something New Mom Takes Your Questions,"Jessica Blankenship, Contributor
Writer, vodka enthusiast and future wife of Bon Iver",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-20-something-new-mom-takes-your-questions_us_5b9d9bd1e4b03a1dcc8a23e2,"Cooking a person in your guts, pushing it out, and guiding it through the mindf*ck of being suddenly alive is an all-consuming project.",2013-12-18,Their Baby Cuteness Doesn't Predict Adult Attractiveness ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9b03bb26000036007ef76b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Is your brain exploding with unimaginable love feelings? Here's the thing: the first few minutes, and days, and even weeks or months after giving birth, not everyone is immediately b*tch-slapped with love for their kid.You do feel... connected. You feel a primal, biological need to feed, and protect this squishy, new water balloon of a human. But that compulsion can be uncomfortable at first. Sure, you've loved people before, but your primary obligation has heretofore been ultimately to yourself. I really don't think it's until you have a child that you actually love someone more than yourself, in a literal way. And in the beginning, before you've had a chance to get to know your baby and truly fall in love with the person they are (you will eventually, and it's f*cking grand), you still immediately know that your obligation is to them. It's intense. Personally, I dug these super big, super cosmic, ancient she-warrior protective instincts coming out in me. In the rest of my life, I feel so interested in so many things that my energy towards them can get frantically scattered. Having moments of feeling unshakable purpose and focus is refreshing and empowering. Don't convince yourself that you're a broken, dead-hearted, bad mother if you feel a lack of immediate, blinding love for this brand new person who you just f*cking met. And let's not pretend that ""loving someone more than yourself"" is an altogether positive thing. It can be a dangerous thing. If nothing else, it's a truly disorienting thing. Your entire emotional composition becomes reconfigured, and while I can't say that there is ultimately anything bad about having anyone -- baby or otherwise -- inspire a love that hardcore, it's not always an easy adjustment to make. That said, my baby is gorgeous and smells delicious and laughs at me and is basically a unicorn, so there's nothing sad about this huge emotional shift, even if it's weird. It's good weird.Do you miss living alone? Yes and no. What I came to realize is that feeling comfortable with this huge shift is dependent upon the same thing that allows me to feel comfortable with any big change in my life; it's not about feeling 100 percent sure, 100 percent of the time, about choosing one thing over another, as much as it is about accepting that there can -- and almost inevitably will -- be a balance to things. Most of life is lived in gray areas, with situations constantly evolving.In this case, as to whether or not I miss living alone, I guess the answer begs a more specific question. When someone asks this, they usually really mean, ""Does it suck having someone else in your space all the time forever?"" The whole answer, as I understand it so far, is yes, that would suck. But you can't let things be like that. The trick is to realize that, contrary to the widespread notion that to parent is to martyr your entire existence in servitude to your child, your relationship with your kid is like a relationship with anyone else you love. You need balance. You need boundaries. You need to take care of yourself. Not only will that save your sanity and make you a more complete person who will undoubtedly be more positive, present, and altogether wonderful for your kid, but you'll be teaching him or her that no relationship is a one-way street. I mean, I figure my son's very first relationship, the template upon which he will base all future relationships, is with me. What kind of sh*tty disservice would I be doing him if I taught him that you should forsake yourself for someone you love, or that you should expect someone you love to surrender themselves completely to you? Some things about living alone will get left behind. And you should mourn those things. The completely unfettered freedom of pre-baby life will never stop tugging on your nostalgia bone altogether, but that doesn't mean you prefer it, or are longing for it, or regret having a kid. It just means you were awesome. You can still be awesome, you just have to do so while nurturing, and loving, and being respectful of another person sharing your space. But learning how to do those things will make you endlessly more awesome, so it works out.Does labor hurt? No. That's what I say when someone is ridiculous enough to ask me this question. I just say ""no"" and nothing else. Wallow in your confusion, fool.Do you still have a social life? Prepare to be surprised by your friends. Some people who you considered to be serious ride-or-die besties will suddenly disappear, while others who you never would've imagined as the down-to-diaper type will rise up as unexpected sources of solidarity during this time of change. Don't kid yourself -- your social life will never look the same. You won't be randomly deciding on a Friday afternoon to run off to the beach for the weekend with friends. New love bed death, impromptu road trips, and other such social pursuits require a wonderfully irresponsible shirking of obligations, which isn't so cool once a human life is the thing you would need to blow off. But there is a trade-off. Feeling good about swapping old pastimes for new ones is the same when you have a baby as it is when, say, you get a really great new job; you have to let go of certain things you love that conflict with your new commitment, but the commitment itself begets some incredible rewards of its own. And they're new things. The real key to escaping social withdrawal pains after entering babydom is to be brave and adventurous enough to look forward, to not need to cling to the things that are comfortable and familiar. You have to feel excited about learning, and moving forward, and evolving. But fighting against growth is going to make for a painful, friction-filled life no matter what. If a baby doesn't alter your 20s social bubble, something else eventually will.Yeah, but you can still see people sometimes, right? Cooking a person in your guts, pushing it out, and guiding it through the mindf*ck of being suddenly alive is an all-consuming project. As with any kind of all-consuming project, the more wholly you commit yourself to it, the more successful it will be. That said, things level out. Suddenly, you're not pregnant anymore, your newborn is an older baby who sleeps all night and is increasingly independent, and you find yourself able to start re-integrating your pre-baby interests. There is an upside to being taken out of your normal social routine: you figure out which parts of it really mean something to you, rather than just being sh*t you did because there wasn't anything else to do. At first, when you're pregnant or the baby is brand new, and you truly have no time or energy for anything, you miss everything. It's shocking. More time goes by, and you only keep missing a few things. You miss certain friends and activities more than others, and you realize that you don't miss a lot of things at all. When you find yourself in a position where your kid is asleep for the night and you have a few hours until you involuntarily pass out, and you have to pick the one very most special thing to do, you can't help but look at your choices in that moment, and know what is actually important to you. And you'll want to eat your baby's face in gratitude for finally helping you weed out some of the senseless activity noise that used to clutter and overwhelm your life. You have a legitimate hierarchy of priorities now! Ring the alarm! High five!How is your vagina? Like, is it weird now? No. Not weirder than it was before, anyway. I'm not going to pretend that the prospect of fitting a nine-pound person through my vaj-hole didn't have me convinced that it was game over for my vagina looking youthful ever again. I thought my clit would fall off and I would never have an orgasm again, or that the nerves would somehow come loose. But as it turns out, vaginas are magicians. They just do the damn thing, take a breather, snap back, and get back to business. And while I feel like mine is pretty much the same, I'm staunchly against the vagina-shaming aesthetic standards that our society brutally upholds. Vaginas are inherently weird looking, and eventually mine won't look as young as it once did, and I plan to love it anyway. And any potential sex partner who isn't entirely into the overall awesome, gross weirdness of sex organs isn't someone I want to let up in there anyway. As a whole, I'm still blown away by what my body did to make a person. It's unreal. Bodies are incredible.This article originally appeared on Thought Catalog.

4,WELLNESS,Why Do We Heed Celebrity Health Advice?,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/celebrity-health-advice_us_5b9db8b0e4b03a1dcc8c012a,Researchers from McMaster University and the Harvard School of Public Health examined studies published from 1806 to today,2013-12-18,"NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 25: Actress Suzanne Somers leaves the 'New York Live' taping at the NBC Rockefeller Center Studios on September 25, 2013 in New York City. (Photo by Ray Tamarra/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9db8b02000003100fe1305.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There's no question that when celebrities put their name behind a cause, people hop on the bandwagon. And sometimes, it's for good -- for instance, consider the money raised for Parkinson's research by actor Michael J. Fox's foundation, or the money raised to fight HIV/AIDS by singer Sir Elton John's charity. But on the other side of the coin, celebrities can cause needless worry and even undermine the good of public health -- such as Suzanne Somers' advocacy of bioidentical hormones to supposedly reverse aging, though there's no evidence to suggest the effectiveness of such products. So what makes us fall for celebrity health messages, even when they can be so off-base? Researchers from McMaster University and the Harvard School of Public Health examined studies published from 1806 to today looking at why celebrity medical advice and messages seem to affect the decisions we make about our own health. The findings are published in the British Medical Journal. The researchers found that several reasons prevailed. They include:- The ""halo effect"": People generally trust celebrities, so whatever they say seems to be more credible than if someone off the street said it. - ""Herding"": People think that if other people have done it, it must be true and OK to do. - A true connection: The connection between a celebrity and product/behavior is often viewed as authentic, increasing that celebrity's credibility. - The ""cool factor"": If a celebrity is doing a certain thing, people also want to do it because of the ""social capital"" you achieve. ""Celebrities can thereby be helpful or threaten the public’s health,"" researchers wrote in the study. ""Their power can be harnessed to disseminate information based on the best available research evidence, or it can be abused to promote useless products and bogus treatments."" On the plus side, famous names can also hold sway for positive health behaviors. A recent study in the journal Preventive Medicine showed that when a celebrity quits smoking -- in this study's case, Brazil President Lula da Silva -- interest in smoking cessation among the general public rises dramatically.

7,FOOD & DRINK,Cooking Off the Cuff: The Once And Future Bean -- Striped Bass,"Edward Schneider, Contributor
Travel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-the_us_5b9db99ae4b03a1dcc8c0ea8,The simplicity of this dish is striking. It is just cooked beans on a plate topped with a piece of fish.,2013-12-18,The unidentified bean: perhaps a Lazy Housewife pole bean? Any ID would be welcome,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9db9982000004e00fe1371.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Before and after last week's pasta e fagioli with celeriac, beans have repeatedly been on the menu at our house this winter (actually, fall, even though it's snowing outside), with pork, with duck, with lamb and with other vegetables, mainly in soups and braised dishes. Once, with the addition of extra bean broth, the remains of a duck and pork belly braise morphed into a hearty soup that was good enough to serve to guests.Most recently, I made something completely different. I was looking at photographs from an September-October trip, and these reminded me that in two restaurants, one in London and one in the Hampshire countryside, Jackie and I ate fish on a bed of white beans (in both cases, French coco beans, which are very like our great northern beans and which you see a lot of in Britain). The version I slightly preferred, at London's Merchants Tavern, was a little lighter and the sauce part of the bean mixture a little less dense (though it still contained bean puree to give it some body). It had a lovely aroma of rosemary if I remember aright, and even if it didn't it was rosemary that came to mind as I thought about making something along the same lines at home.The first thing to consider was the beans (the fish would not be identified until a visit to the farmers' market a day or two later). I was going to cook a pound of cannellini anyway, and these were already soaking. But there was also this Ziploc bag of beautiful little elongated white beans. Unlabeled, of course, and hence anonymous, though I did remember their having entered the apartment within the past year. (If anyone recognizes them from the photograph, please ID them by leaving a comment on this post.) Whatever they were, between their relative youth and their small size, they needed only a few hours of soaking until they were swollen and soft enough to bite into easily. Using my more or less Tuscan method, I brought them to the boil very, very slowly in salted water with a little oil and, in this case, a sprig of fresh rosemary and a small clove of garlic, peeled but whole. At a bare simmer, they were tender in about an hour -- though that is not something you can count on with whatever beans you might use: great northerns, cannellini and other white beans are certain to take longer unless they were dried very recently or unless you cook them in a pressure cooker, which works very well.I removed all the rosemary leaves (which of course had detached from the stem and had to be picked out one by one) and the garlic, and let the beans cool in their broth before refrigerating them. A couple of mornings later, the (snow-dusted) farmers' market offered quite a few viable fish options, among them striped bass. It is hard to resist that fish, and it is a safe choice for company -- no one doesn't like it, except for those who don't eat fish at all of course.When I got home, I took some of the cooked beans and their broth, heated them in a little pan and pureed them using an immersion blender. The goal was a creamy consistency and good flavor; by tinkering with the quantity of broth the former was easy to attain, and the latter was ninety percent built in: the beans were delicious and the rosemary-garlic-olive-oil flavor present but not obtrusive. Still, because fish was on the menu and because lemon and rosemary always get along extremely well, I also added the grated zest and the juice of half a medium lemon, resulting in a brighter but still beany flavor. I also reinforced the rosemary flavor with a teaspoonful of chopped fresh rosemary leaves.At dinner time, I separately reheated the whole beans and the puree (checking seasoning), then turned to the striped bass. The seasoned fish was cooked plain in a skillet with olive oil; when the skin had browned I put the pan into the oven to finish cooking the flesh. If the oven hadn't been on for another purpose, I'd have cooked it all the way on top of the stove. You could also steam the fish; though you'd miss the nice crisp skin, the outcome would be lovely -- softer both in flavor and in texture.Just before the fish was done, I put some beans and some puree onto each (heated) plate, then topped this with a piece of fish. I thought of drizzling each serving with good olive oil, but thought better of it: there was still a residual olive-oil aroma from the initial cooking of the beans, and there was no need to reinforce this -- though it wouldn't have done any harm and you might like to try it.The simplicity of this dish is striking. It is just cooked beans on a plate topped with a piece of fish. But with good beans, good seasoning and good fish, it is a real pleasure to eat. And it makes a nice diversion from the usual round of heavier wintery bean dishes -- to which we are now eagerly reverting before today's snowfall melts."

You've spent the day touring his boyhood home, a bit shocked to see the actual bed on which Sarah Roosevelt gave birth to him, and spent hours learning about our only US President to have been elected four terms in a row only to die a year and a half into his fourth term. FDR's New Deal helped steer our country out of the Great Depression and his final years brought us into the Second World War. If you do nothing else in this town, spend a day here.But Hyde Park and its neighboring towns hold much more in store for visitors, and for those who plan to spend a few days here, the following attractions should not be missed. Val-Kill: Eleanor Roosevelt National Historic SiteConsidered ""The First Lady of Civil Rights,"" journalist-activist Eleanor revolutionized the role of the First Lady. When her husband Franklin Delano Roosevelt (FDR) entered the White House in 1933, Eleanor traveled 40,000 miles during his first presidential year alone. As a matter of fact, it was headline news when she stayed home. Eleanor continued to agitate for humanitarian causes even after FDR's death in 1945 -- representing the US in the newly formed United Nations, and authoring the Universal Declaration of Human Rights guaranteeing ""equal citizenship for all."" Taking a strong stand on Civil Rights, she was threatened by the KKK, who put a $25,000 bounty on her head during a solo trip to Tennessee, driving on dark mountain roads, finding burning crosses at every turn. She was petrified, but courageous.Named after the Dutch word for Country Stream, Val-Kill was the only home Eleanor Roosevelt ever owned. Inside, it is preserved just as Eleanor left it, thanks to the fact that most of the furniture once sold off has been returned intact. You can just imagine Eleanor picking flowers outside, arranging them on the drop-leaf table and settling into her couch made at her on-site factory, Val-Kill Industries. She hosted royalty and world dignitaries in this very modest space, allowing for a ""Ten Minute Cocktail Hour."" (As the daughter of an alcoholic, she frowned on drinking, but would tolerate it for ten minutes). She had her dining room table set with cheap glasses she called ""crystal,"" and furnished her home with Val-Kill produced tableware and furniture. She'd often invite 20 people for an impromptu dinner, throwing her staff into a tizzy. One guest was Nikita Khrushchev who spoke Russian all morning, but then at the conclusion of dinner, reached across the table for a cookie and said in perfect English, ""one for the road.""If you are lucky enough to get 90 year old Doris Mack as guide, she'll tell you firsthand how the Roosevelt's would host at-risk kids from the Wiltwyck School for Boys for picnics and a swim in the pool. Eleanor, Mack says, gave her daughter her first ""doll of color."" Mack met Eleanor through her husband, who wrote his PhD dissertation on the Wiltwyck School and was invited many times to Val-Kill.Vanderbilt Mansion National Historic Site A 54-room relic of the Gilded Age this late 1890's Beaux-Arts Vanderbilt Mansion is arguably the best example of an intact Gilded Age Mansion in existence, and unbelievably, compared to other Vanderbilt mansions around the country, the smallest. Begin in what was the Bachelor's Guest Cottage (now Visitor's Center), with animal heads over a walk-in fireplace. A uniformed ranger guides you through the life and seasonal cottage of Frederick Vanderbilt, one of eight Vanderbilt grandchildren who conspicuously consumed their Grandpa Cornelius's vast fortune. Fredrick and his wife, Louise, spent just a few months a year here and had no children, so the home was left to Frederick's niece, Margaret Van Allen, who was approached by none other than neighbor Franklin D. Roosevelt who implored her to donate the home to the National Park Service. A tour provides an intimate look at this palace of excess, simply a showcase for great wealth rather than multi-generational ancestral home. It held neither family portraits nor photos. Fainting couches were scattered about for corseted women guests who tended to loose consciousness. After meals, men smoked cigars in Frederick's study -- his a ""Gilded Age Man Cave,"" while the women gossiped in Louise's fit-for-a-queen gold-leafed reception room. You'll be sure to gape at the opulence throughout the hour-long tour.Staatsburg Historic Site (Mills Mansion), StaatsburgLike the Vanderbilt's place down the road, this McKim, Mead and White designed mansion was built in 1895 to showcase great wealth. Originally belonging to the family of Ruth Livingston, Ruth aspired to rise to the top of Society after marrying financier Ogden Mills. She hired McKim, Mead and White to expand the 25-room Hudson River home into the 79 room palace it is today. See Ruth and Ogden's royal bedrooms with 18 ft. ceilings, draped in finery: hers a fantasia in pink, with crystal chandeliers, his deep burgundy with crowns on headboard and ceiling. Fans of a certain PBS show will want to take the 1 ½ hour Downton Abby Tour, which brings you back to the days when the elite would visit and, Ruth probably hoped, turn green with envy.Locust Grove, PoughkeepsieThis was the home of Samuel Morse, the ""Father of Modern Telecommunication,"" who purchased the Ornamental Federal-Style Locust Grove in 1847, then remodeled it as an Italianate Villa with a large Tuscan tower and 2-story porte cochere as a Hudson River-side summer retreat for his family. In 1835, as a Professor of Art at NYU, Morse also had a penchant for electromagnetic communication -- devising the dots and dashes that would become known as Morse Code. You can learn about his life and inventions as well as the lifestyle of the Young Family who bought the home in 1895, a couple of decades after Morse's death.Walkway Over the Hudson, PoughkeepsieThe 1.28 mile Walkway Over the Hudson State Historic Park was once the steel Poughkeepsie-Highland Railroad Bridge that from 1888 to 1974 bore the weight of up to 3,500 freight cars a day. A dominant force in transporting western raw materials with eastern industrial centers, the bridge fell into decline after a fire nearly destroyed it in 1974. Transformed into a public park in Fall 2009, the bridge hovers 212 feet above the Hudson River and draws thousands of hikers, dog-walkers, new parents pushing strollers and tourists each year. Views up and down the Hudson River from the bridge are what you'd expect from a river valley that launched a whole school of art; magnificent. Tour then Have a Meal at the Culinary Institute of America (CIA)With an enrollment of 2,800, the Culinary Institute of America (CIA) in Hyde Park is a destination unto itself. Take a tour through tiled halls, peaking into the ""Wine Spectator"" Classroom -- the only place in New York State where students aged 18-21 can sip (then spit out) wine -- the Anheuser-Busch Lecture Hall where students learn the art of classical cuisine, and various kitchens to watch men and women in whites mixing, chopping and learning the elements of cooking. Students make meals for each other, so you'll be sure to see a few working away before taking their trays to the former Jesuit Chapel, now the magnificent Farquharson Dining Hall. This college for the cooking elite pampers those lucky enough to score a table at one of the four training restaurants: American Bounty and Bocuse (both high end), Apple Pie Bakery Café and Catherina de' Medici (more casual). Though the chefs and staff are students, meals merit favorable comparison to many multi-starred restaurants. The contemporary Bocuse, named for French Celeb chef, Paul Bocuse, replaced the fussier Escoffier Room.Try to get a coveted seat hard by the kitchen window to watch students cooking and line up for filled orders. Opt for the Black Truffle Soup -- a piquant beef broth, infused with earthy truffle and topped with a dome of golden puff pastry ($13). Finish with ice-cream made tableside with dramatic clouds of dry ice. You don't know what's more thrilling -- the excellent food or the knowledge that these waiters and chefs will be off to the finest restaurants (or starting their own) within three weeks.You'll find more information about these attractions and recommendations for other area restaurants and lodging at GetawayMavens.com."

This is the first child for Casiraghi, daughter of Princess Caroline and granddaughter of the late Prince Rainier and Princess Grace, and her fiance, Gad Elmaleh. Raphael is just the latest of the noble bébés in Monaco. In March, Charlotte's brother Andrea Casiraghi and his then-fiance, Tatiana Santo Domingo, welcomed a son, giving Princess Caroline her first grandchild. Princess Stéphanie, Caroline's sister, has no grandchildren yet, although she has three children of her own. We can't help but point out, however, that Stéphanie and Caroline's brother, Prince Albert II, not only has no grandchildren -- he still has no children with his wife, Princess Charlene. Albert does have two children (and at least one more lingering paternity test), but each were born out of wedlock and therefore cannot claim the throne as legitimate heirs. So the pressure is on Albert's wife, Princess Charlene, to produce an heir. ""Now I'm settled, and I think kids will come,"" Char told Hello! back in May. In the meantime, Albert and Charlene have more than enough nephews to keep themselves occupied...Congrats to Charlotte and Gad! We can't wait to see Raphael.A most stylish mother:Want more?
