0,POLITICS,A Super PAC Was Actually Fined For Breaking The Rules,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/super-pac-fine-mitt-romney_us_566b3ee8e4b0e292150df0cb,"The nearly four-year FEC investigation led to a $50,000 penalty.",2015-12-11,The super PAC was supporting Mitt Romney's 2012 presidential campaign.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/566b3f841f00002d00e9b97b.jpeg?ops=crop_37_30_3133_1926%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Election Commission last month fined a super PAC for illegally re-airing a commercial in 2012 that had been produced by Mitt Romney's presidential campaign. Better late than never.In 2012, Restore Our Future, the super PAC run by Romney's former aides, spent $4.3 million to run a television ad detailing Romney's role in helping to locate a coworker's missing child while he was head of Bain Capital. That spot was originally created by Romney's even-less-successful 2008 presidential campaign. The super PAC simply rebroadcast the exact same ad with a new disclaimer saying it was paid for by Restore Our Future.The move violated multiple campaign finance laws. The republication of campaign materials must be reported to the FEC as an in-kind donation to the campaign, which the super PAC did not do. Even if it had, super PACs are prohibited from contributing to a candidate's campaign. The running of the ad therefore constituted a form of illegal coordination between the super PAC and the campaign.At the time of the ad's airing, the Campaign Legal Center filed a complaint with the FEC. Restore Our Future's lawyer Charles Spies, now the lawyer for Jeb Bush's super PAC, told The Huffington Post that the super PAC had bought the footage from the firm hired to create it. Paul Ryan of the Campaign Legal Center said the act of purchasing it did not matter.""If the ad was prepared by Romney or an agent of Romney, then this rule applies,"" Ryan said at the time. ""The rule would be meaningless if you could transfer the legal rights from the campaign to another actor.""Restore Our Future further argued to the FEC that the use of footage produced by the 2008 Romney campaign could not be an in-kind contribution to the 2012 Romney campaign because ""Mitt Romney as a 'candidate' in 2008 is an entirely different entity from Mitt Romney as a 'candidate' in 2012.""The FEC had not previously considered whether the law could be applied across election cycles to the same candidate. The agency decided it could.In November, the FEC levied a $50,000 fine on the super PAC.Despite its apparent victory, the Campaign Legal Center was not pleased by the size of the fine or the length of the investigation.""This was a blatant violation of the law. It's unacceptable that the FEC took nearly four years to resolve the matter with a fine that amounts to a light slap on the wrist for millions of dollars in illegal spending,"" Ryan said in a statement.He has a point: A comparatively small fine, levied long after the election concluded, does not amount to vigorous enforcement of the law.""On the bright side,"" Ryan said, ""the FEC has now confirmed the obvious: it's illegal for Super PACs to recycle candidate campaign ads."""
1,IMPACT,Here's More Proof That Giving Housing To Vets Prevents Homelessness,Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/even-more-proof-that-giving-housing-to-vets-prevents-homelessness_us_5668acc1e4b009377b23baf9,"At the conclusion of the pilot program, just 6% of clients remained homeless.",2015-12-11,"Jannet Taylor, who served at Fort Hood, was at risk of losing her home after she lost her job at a nonprofit. But with help from Veterans Homelessness Prevention Demonstration, Taylor was able to avoid being evicted and eventually got a job at the VA. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5669eed219000024007899ab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the deadline to end veteran homelessness fast approaches, additional research has proven that eliminating the issue lay in a simple approach: providing housing.Numerous studies have concluded that giving housing to homeless people is a cost-effective and surefire way to keep them off of the streets. And a new report has found that that same approach also works to keep at-risk veterans housed, healthy and better equipped to get jobs, despite the fact that this demographic often faces greater medical and disability issues than the general population.The Veterans Homelessness Prevention Demonstration, one of the first groups to target post-9/11 veterans, released a report on Thursday highlighting the successes of a three-year pilot program, which provided housing and case management services to 2,023 homeless and at-risk veterans.At the conclusion of the program, the group found that just 6 percent of participants were homeless.The program followed the “housing first” model, which pushes providing shelter to people in need first, and then addressing their health and employment issues. It’s an approach that successful U.S. cities and states have implemented in order to meet the Obama administration’s goal of ending veteran homelessness by the end of 2015.Virginia became the first state to “functionally” end veteran homelessness in November. That means the state has housed every homeless veteran who was open to receiving help and could shelter a veteran in need within 90 days. To effectively address the needs of its clients, VHPD partnered with the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Labor, in order to rapidly house at-risk veterans and those who were homeless for less than three months.HUD funds for each household ranged from $3,513 to $5,626 to cover the program’s costs.Participants were assigned to one of five sites around the U.S. where they were given housing assistance, health care and employment services. The median length of stay for participants was 84 days before transitioning to a long-term housing solution.While the program followed the standard housing first model, it had to tailor the approach in order to address the specific obstacles that veterans face.For example, 44 percent of clients rated their health as “poor.” That’s “remarkably high,” according to the report, considering that fewer than one in 10 people in the U.S. are in fair or poor health.This demographic also faces additional challenges when it comes to securing employment.Forty-three percent of veterans reported being unable to work due to a disability.But by connecting veterans with benefits programs, and providing job assistance to those who are able to work, the program was able to significantly increase clients’ incomes.At the conclusion of the program, the average household’s income increased by 43 percent to $1,535.Part of the program’s success hinged on its ability to cull resources from multiple agencies to immediately address crisis situations.Jannet Taylor, a veteran who served more than a dozen years in the Army and National Guard Reserve, was one of the clients who benefited from the program’s pliability.After earning her degree, Taylor worked in the nonprofit sector. But after the organization lost its grant funding, the breast cancer survivor lost her job and was at risk of losing her home in 2012. When learned about VHPD, Taylor enrolled in the organization’s central Texas branch. The group helped stave off her eviction and began working with her on securing a new job. Within four months, Taylor got a job that paid enough for her to keep her house. She now works as medical support assistant at the VA.“I am in a good place now,” Taylor said in a statement. “Yes, I had some difficult times, but then, I guess without the rain, you can’t enjoy the sunshine.”Also on HuffPost:"

The move came hours after the U.S. Justice Department filed a brief at the U.S. District Court in Dallas saying the federal government and not the states sets U.S. policy on immigration.Texas said in that case the government had provided the information it requested on the group, which was two families of six each who arrived in Dallas and Houston on Monday.After the November 13 attacks in Paris for which the group Islamic State claimed responsibility, Texas Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, was one of the first governors to seek to block on security grounds the resettlement of Syrians in their states.""It is essential that a judge consider halting the Syrian refugee process, at least on a temporary basis, to ensure refugees coming to the United States will be vetted in a way that does not compromise the safety of Americans and Texans,"" Abbott said in a statement.A family of eight Syrian refugees, including six children ages 6 to 15, is due to arrive in Houston on Thursday, along with a 26-year-old Syrian woman whose mother resides in the area, the Justice Department said last Friday in a court filing.The Justice Department said in that filing the Refugee Act of 1980 requires the government to consult on a regular basis with states about the sponsorship process and distribution among states.""It does not create any obligation to provide advance consultation regarding individual resettlement decisions,"" it said in the filing.A federal judge is expected to hear a request from Texas in the next few weeks seeking an injunction to halt the resettlements.A Texas House committee will hear testimony on Dec. 15 on Abbott's plans to halt Syrian refugee resettlement in the state.Since fiscal 2011, 243 Syrian refugees have resettled in Texas, the U.S. filing said, making it one of the main U.S. relocation sites since the Syrian civil war erupted about four and a half years ago.

5,POLITICS,Rubio's Boast Of Stopping Obamacare 'Bailout' Omits Some Crucial Facts,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marco-rubio-obamacare-bailout_us_5668a2dfe4b0f290e521e056,But his move did cause problems for some insurers and their customers.,2015-12-10,Marco Rubio claims he led an important strike against Obamacare.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5668a37f1600002800e55809.jpeg?cache=WI114KMcTe&ops=crop_0_32_5604_3406%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Marco Rubio likes to brag that he is the mastermind behind the Republicans' one successful attack on the Affordable Care Act -- that he stopped a ""bailout"" of private insurance companies and, in the process, saved taxpayers $2.5 billion. The boast has some truth. What the GOP presidential candidate doesn't mention is that, because of his efforts, some people are likely to face higher premiums for their health coverage and insurance markets on the whole are less stable.Nor does Rubio mention that just last year he supported using taxpayer funds to prop up another insurance program -- through an arrangement that more closely resembles a bailout than anything in the Affordable Care Act.The object of Rubio's ire is the law's ""risk corridor"" program. Its purpose is to smooth the transition from the old, unreformed insurance market to a world in which carriers must provide insurance to anybody, regardless of pre-existing conditions, and in which they cannot vary premiums based on likely medical risk.The officials and lawmakers who actually wrote the Affordable Care Act understood that, initially, insurers wouldn't know how to set their new premiums and design their new packages. The data collected before the health care law took effect simply couldn't provide enough information about who would actually sign up for coverage in the new market -- or what kind of policies they'd want. Insurers might guess wrong, charge too much and make extra profits. Or they might guess wrong, charge too little and incur extra losses.The idea of risk corridors is to protect both the insurers and the taxpayers. Insurers who made those extra profits would pay into the system, while insurers who saw unexpected losses would get money back. The hope was that the program would turn out to be roughly revenue-neutral, with the money coming in covering the money going out. It didn't work out that way. On the whole, insurers expected a mix of customers with a relatively higher proportion of healthier people than those who did sign up -- a legitimate problem, but one the risk corridors were designed to address. Following the first year of coverage in 2014, insurers put in claims to the risk corridor program worth a net $2.5 billion. (To be more precise, claims to obtain money from the program equaled $2.9 billion, while insurers' payments into the system came to $362 million.)By then, however, Rubio and other conservatives had already started attacking the program as a bailout -- not just of the health insurance industry, but of Obamacare itself. Administration officials tried to dodge those attacks by stipulating that the program would be ""budget neutral"" without specifying how, precisely, the Department of Health and Human Services would accomplish that.Unsatisfied, Rubio called upon Congress to block HHS from shuffling funds within the department budget. Late last year, he succeeded in passing such an amendment to a big government spending bill. Under its terms, HHS in 2015 could make payments only with the money coming into the risk corridor program from other insurers. The prohibition does not apply for 2016, which is why the issue is coming up now on Capitol Hill, with conservatives making the same demands to block funding. Chances are good they will succeed.Insurers understood the implications of Rubio's victory better, and earlier, than just about anybody else. They knew it would mean that the federal government couldn't make the promised payments. Sure enough, the administration announced a few months ago that HHS would be paying just 13 percent of the money that insurers had expected, because that's all the money it had at its disposal. Large insurers, like Blue Cross plans, have the customers and cash reserves to absorb those losses pretty easily. It's a different story for smaller insurers who had counted on that money. The loss of risk corridor money is one reason, and maybe a big reason, that a dozen small cooperative insurers have shut down in the last few months. Going forward, some insurers are bound to charge higher premiums, at least for the next year or two, because they can't count on risk corridor money -- although we don't know how significant the premium increases will be or how many people they will affect.Rubio claims that his victory has weakened Obamacare and it has, albeit incrementally. But the basic conceit of the Florida senator's claim -- that he's stopped a bailout, the kind most Americans associate with the Wall Street or auto industry rescues -- doesn't hold up to even casual scrutiny. This wasn't a case of corporations acting irresponsibly and then, after incurring hundreds of billions of dollars in losses, demanding that taxpayers rescue them. This was business and government agreeing in advance to share in either profits or losses, in order to help along a fledgling insurance market. Politifact has rated Rubio's claim as ""mostly false."" Even some conservatives, like Scott Gottlieb, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, have said that calling the risk corridors a bailout is wrong. The numbers also put Rubio's boast into perspective, since $2.5 billion is tiny given the size of Obamacare -- and the health care law is, by all accounts, costing significantly less than even its promoters expected.Rubio and his allies might argue that they oppose risk corridors on sheer principle, that government simply has no business insulating insurers from losses (or sharing in their profits). But if that's the case, the Affordable Care Act shouldn't be the only government insurance program on their target lists. Medicare Part D should be too. Part D, which a Republican Congress designed and a Republican president signed into law in 2003, provides prescription drug benefits to seniors and the disabled through private insurance companies. It has a risk corridor program that operates almost exactly like the one in the Affordable Care Act. The only substantive difference is that Part D's program is permanent. Yet neither Rubio nor any other conservative is yelling about that.But, then, Rubio's definition of a ""bailout"" seems to change a great deal depending upon the circumstances. Early in 2014, the federal flood insurance program came up short on funds and needed an infusion of dollars. Without the extra money, flood insurance premiums would have risen sharply and real estate markets could have taken a hit. The problems would have been particularly severe in Florida, with its low-lying land and vulnerability to hurricanes. Rubio hemmed and hawed a bit, called for long-term changes to the program, but ultimately voted for the infusion of money because it would spare his constituents the financial burden. That's a fair position for an elected official, even a conservative one, to take. But Rubio seems to think the same calculus doesn't apply when there's an opportunity to score political points against President Barack Obama and his health care law."

Jeb Bush’s super PAC has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is relying on illegal corporate contributions for his campaign.It might be ironic to see Charles Spies, lawyer for Bush’s Right to Rise super PAC, file a complaint against another candidate after Right to Rise has been the subject of multiple FEC complaints and a referral for investigation by the Department of Justice, but the allegation is worth considering nonetheless.At issue is Trump’s reliance on Alan Garten, the counsel paid by his Trump Organization, to threaten other political organizations running negative advertisements against Trump with a “multi-million dollar lawsuit” if they do not cease and desist. Using official Trump Organization letterhead, Garten has sent letters to Bush’s Right to Rise, the conservative Club for Growth, a super PAC supporting Ohio Gov. John Kasich’s presidential campaign and Bush megadonor Mike Fernandez for running advertisements opposing Trump’s candidacy, and the company StopTrump.us for printing anti-Trump t-shirts. The complaint leveled against Trump, his campaign and his company alleges that Garten’s letters threatening retribution are in fact an in-kind corporate contribution. Federal political candidates are banned from receiving corporate contributions whether direct or in-kind. Spies’ complaint further argues that Trump is in violation of the 2002 Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act’s ban on the solicitation and use of funds that exceed candidate contribution limits, also known as “soft money.”Trump’s campaign has claimed that Garten is simply providing his services on a volunteer basis, something allowed by law. However, the fact that his legal threats are communicated on official Trump Organization letterhead is a seeming indication that they carry the full weight of the corporation.The outcome of this complaint will likely not be known for sometime as the FEC generally takes years to fully investigate serious violations of campaign finance law. Even then, those investigations can often end with no determination of a violation if the commissioners deadlock on a vote to find any wrongdoing or impose any penalty.In the meantime, the actions that spurred the complaint do provide a preview of the kinds of conflicts that could emerge from a Trump presidency. As The Huffington Post has reported, many important conflict of interest ethics laws do not apply to the presidency, which would allow Trump to maintain control of the Trump Organization while also occupying the presidency.Even if Trump handed off control of the corporation to his children, as he maintains he would do if elected, its lawyers could still pursue legal action, backed by the company’s treasury, against critics making negative remarks, running negative advertisements or speaking negatively about Trump in the press.Read the FEC complaint against Trump and the letter Spies sent to Trump's lawyer below:"

Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) offered harsh words about her colleagues Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) in an interview released Thursday, questioning whether either senator was qualified to be president.Speaking on the ""The Axe Files,"" a podcast hosted by former White House adviser David Axelrod, the Missouri Democrat accused Rubio of folding ""like a cheap shotgun"" on immigration reform and said Cruz isn't respected by his colleagues.""I hate to speak ill of my colleagues. I think Marco is smart. I think he is capable. I watched him find that sweet spot of compromise on immigration reform, but then he broke down like a cheap shotgun the minute the right started chewing on his rear end,"" McCaskill said.Rubio helped draft the so-called ""gang of eight"" immigration reform bill in 2013, but has since distanced himself from the legislation, which went on to die in the House. Cruz and other conservatives have criticized Rubio for supporting the bill, which would have provided a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. while also strengthening border security. ""He was like, 'What? Me? Immigration reform? Wasn’t me.' And that was really disappointing to me,"" McCaskill said of Rubio's reversal.""That’s not what presidents are made of,"" she said. ""Yes, you’ve got to be sensitive to where the country is, but you also have to lead. You have to lead. You can’t be led. You’ve got to lead.”Turning to Cruz, McCaskill said she wouldn't be surprised if he won the nomination, but added that his colleagues don't respect him.""It worries me a little bit because you don’t have to be popular with other senators, but you need to be respected by other senators if you have what it takes to be President of the United States,"" she said. ""I mean, Barack Obama wasn’t popular with all the other senators, but he was respected. Marco is respected. I don’t think Ted has the respect of his fellow senators.”McCaskill was an early supporter of President Barack Obama's candidacy and has endorsed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election. The senator also had some criticism for Obama, saying that he sometimes failed to consider the perspective of lawmakers who might fear the political consequences of supporting a given issue.""He is my friend and I am loyal to him,"" McCaskill said, ""but one of the president's shortcomings is that sometimes he sees the world through his eyes and doesn’t do, I think, enough work on being empathetic about how other people view things.""Also on HuffPost:"

Yale said this week its investigation ""found no evidence of systematic discrimination against people of color.""Jonathan Holloway, dean of Yale College, the undergraduate school at the university, wrote to the campus on Wednesday:Students inside the party reported that early in the evening, before the party became crowded, guests were granted admission on a first-come basis; men and women of color were among those admitted. On the other hand, students also reported that as the event became intensely crowded, hosts restricted admission, applying subjective criteria and using harsh language. When the investigation focused on what hosts had said specifically, two students provided credible accounts that they were told, or heard either one or two SAE members say, ""white girls only"" as they were seeking admission to the party, although the SAE members interviewed denied making these statements and nobody else who was interviewed heard the statements.The original claim stemmed from a Facebook post by a Yale student who received a secondhand account of the alleged discrimination from a friend who does not attend the school. SAE members have denied all along that they ever said the party was ""white girls only,"" and said black members of the chapter had been called ""Uncle Toms"" following the accusations.When the accusations first surfaced, SAE's national office noted that police had directed fraternity members ""to stop admittance and to create clear walkways outside of the house"" and that it was at this point that someone allegedly said the party was restricted to white people.Yale's investigation found SAE members had mismanaged the crowd at the party and acted ""disrespectfully and aggressively"" toward potential guests. The investigation could not, however, determine that members engaged in racist behavior. Yale will not sanction the fraternity, Holloway said.The university also investigated reports that students spat on attendees at the William F. Buckley Jr. Program's fifth annual conference, but also concluded in that case there wasn't enough evidence to support the claim.Tyler Kingkade covers higher education and is based in New York.

Crowds chanted for the removal of Police Chief Greg Suhr during a contentious public meeting of the city's police commission in City Hall Wednesday night. Outrage over the police shooting of Mario Woods on Dec. 2 has been simmering thanks to several cell phone videos showing police confronting and ultimately shooting Woods. He was armed with a knife and was a suspect in a stabbing earlier that day. Suhr has claimed officers shot Woods after he made a threatening movement with the knife, though public radio station KQED analyzed the video and concluded that a gunshot can be heard before Woods raised his arm. Prior to the shooting, officers used pepper spray and beanbag rounds on Woods, but he clung to the knife despite being hit.Woods was shot 21 times, according to the San Francisco Examiner.Earlier this month, conflict in Chicago over the officer who fatally shot Laquan McDonald led to the firing of that city's police chief, Garry McCarthy. Faced by a series of protests and vigils over Woods, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee has told police to resolve confrontations with the ""minimum use of force.""Suhr also called for his officers to be equipped with Tasers so they have a less lethal weapon to confront some suspects.Protesters, including members of Woods' family, want the five officers who fired charged with murder. The cops' names haven't been released. Woods' family also wants the city to pay for his funeral, according to a cousin who spoke to NBC Bay Area.The San Francisco Police Department could not immediately be reached for comment."

Gen. Wesley Clark, a retired four-star general and former supreme allied commander of NATO forces in Europe, is a surrogate for Clinton's campaign. In a July interview with MSNBC, he spoke favorably of the internment of Nazi sympathizers during World War II and suggested the government should do the same for radical jihadists today. “If these people are radicalized and they don’t support the United States and they’re disloyal to the United States as a matter of principle, fine,” Clark said. “That’s their right and it’s our right and obligation to segregate them from the normal community for the duration of the conflict.”Clark later said his comments were mischaracterized and that he was “for separating people who have made dangerous decisions from the rest of society.”""My comments from last July were not directed at any religion or faith but in response to a question about ISIS recruitment inside the United States,"" Clark said in a statement Thursday evening.

I am troubled by the reaction, from some, to those comments and regret any misunderstanding.""The general stumped for Clinton in Iowa on Veteran’s Day, and the campaign has touted his endorsement on its Facebook page.The controversy over the general's ties with Clinton comes as Donald Trump’s anti-Muslim rhetoric has called attention to Islamophobia in America. Most recently, Trump called to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. While Clinton has forcefully condemned the GOP candidate's proposal, the groups who wrote to her on Thursday say they are “concerned your campaign is sending mixed messages when it comes to Islamophobia.” They ask the former secretary of state to make it clear “that you find such extreme proposals unacceptable” by condemning Clark’s remarks.Clark’s comments further “the anti-Muslim mob mentality” fostered by Trump and other GOP presidential hopefuls, the groups say. They argue that Clinton should “lead by example.”“Mr. Trump recently refused to say whether he would have created Japanese internment camps during World War II,” the letter says. “Anything less than a crystal clear contrast with such fear-mongering will only fuel more hate crimes against American Muslims.""The groups points out that Clinton's campaign immediately removed the mayor of Roanoke, Virginia, from its state leadership team in November after he suggested that the wartime imprisonment of Japanese-Americans during World War II could be a model for interning Syrian refugees.“The internment of people of Japanese descent is a dark cloud on our nation’s history and to suggest that it is anything but a horrible moment in our past is outrageous,” Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin said at the time, explaining the campaign's decision.In a statement Thursday, Clinton spokesman Jesse Ferguson said, ""Hillary has vocally opposed any discrimination against Muslims, believing that any of policies or comments that discriminate against a religion are wrong and not who we are as a country.""On Wednesday, Clinton bashed Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from coming into the country. She addressed Muslim-Americans in an email to supporters, saying that ""what you're hearing from Trump and other Republicans is absolutely, unequivocally wrong."" “Now is the time for all of us to stand up to hateful, dangerous words and deeds,” she said.But Murshed Zaheed, acting political director of CREDO Action, which organized the letter, said Clinton’s response to Trump was undercut by her campaign’s ties to Clark.“While Secretary Clinton is talking the talk when it comes to fighting back against Islamophobia, she has so far refused to walk the walk,” Zaheed said. “By not disassociating herself with General Wesley Clark, Sec. Clinton is choosing to stick with a loyalist over staying true to her principles.""The other groups that signed the letter are ColorOfChange.org, MPower Change, Emerge USA, Bend the Arc, Demand Progress, American Family Voices, We Act Radio, Presente.org, Islamic Society of Boston Cultural Center, and the Muslim American Society of Boston.This story has been updated to include comments from Clark and from the Clinton campaign.Also on HuffPost:"

And dancing better than J.Lo. And J.Lo being angry. I don't want J.Lo to be angry at me."" We feel you, Amy -- we don't think anyone would ever want Jennifer Lopez to be mad at them. For Fallon's turn, Poehler asked, ""Where is some place you've never had sex?"" ""My 20s,"" the host responded, causing the audience and his guest to erupt into laughter.
