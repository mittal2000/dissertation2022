In fact, Jenner, who still isn't old enough to vote or legally purchase alcohol in the U.S., has been touting their ""Viper Venom Wrinkle Fix"" as part of her daily beauty routine since October. And over on the company's website, Nip + Fab encourages shoppers to try ""Kylie's favorites,"" which include ""Glycolic Fix Pads"" that promise to ""unveil younger-looking skin."" Other than having a a hugely recognizable celebrity attached to their brand, it's not clear what Nip + Fab's real strategy is in having a teenager shill anti-aging products. It's kind of like saying: ""These products must work. She gets carded everywhere, and so will you."" H/T: Styleite "

Willie Barrow, a front-line civil rights fighter for decades and a mentor to younger generations of activists, died Thursday in Chicago. She was 90.Barrow was a field organizer for the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., marched on Washington and Selma in the `60s and more recently focused concern on Chicago's gun violence and changes to the Voting Rights Act.Barrow had been hospitalized for treatment of a blood clot in her lung and died early Thursday, said fellow activist the Rev. Michael Pfleger.""She's one of those icons in the movement we've been able to hold onto for a long time, to learn from, to be loved by, to be challenged by,"" Pfleger said.Barrow helped organize sit-ins and boycotts in the South with civil rights icons including King, Rosa Parks and the Rev. Ralph Abernathy.Alongside the Rev. Jesse Jackson, Barrow co-founded the Chicago chapter of Operation Breadbasket, which would become Operation PUSH.Around Chicago, she was known to many as ""godmother"" or ""mother"" for the care she took to advise and inform younger activists.Known as the ""little warrior,"" her short height belied a fiery, charismatic, tell-it-like-it-is attitude unchecked by either concern for political correctness or the stature of whomever she was addressing.""She was a great motivational speaker with the unusual gift of being able to take a scared group of people and inspire them to take militant non-violent action to correct a wrong,"" Jackson said. ""She was an authentic freedom fighter in the linage of Sojourner Truth, Rosa Parks and Fannie Lou Hamer.""She took up causes ranging from women's rights to AIDS awareness. Her son, Keith, died of the disease in 1983. And she traveled widely on missions of peace and outreach, including to Vietnam, Russia, Nicaragua, Cuba and to South Africa when Nelson Mandela was released from prison.Barrow was born in Burton, Texas. In 1936, as a young child, Barrow demanded to be let on her all-white school bus.""The fight for equality she joined that day would become the cause of her life,"" President Barack Obama said in a written statement that lauded Barrow for her ""pursuit of justice for all God's children.""""To Michelle and me, she was a constant inspiration, a lifelong mentor, and a very dear friend,"" Obama said. ""I was proud to count myself among the more than 100 men and women she called her `Godchildren,' and worked hard to live up to her example. I still do.""She studied theology at a seminary in Oregon and moved to Chicago in 1945. Becoming involved in the civil rights movement, Barrow said she always sought to be close to those with power.""I opened my house up to all of the powerful women in the movement - Coretta Scott King, Dorothy Height, Addie Wyatt,"" she once told the Chicago Sun-Times. ""That's how I learned."" And she wanted to pass that wisdom on to others.""We have to teach this generation, train more Corettas, more Addies, more Dorothys,"" she told the newspaper. ""If these youth don't know whose shoulders they stand on, they'll take us back to slavery. And I believe that's why the Lord is still keeping me here."" "

The demonstrators are calling on US President Barack Obama to stop deportations. AFP PHOTO/Mandel NGAN (Photo credit should read MANDEL NGAN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ed57240000310098fcd3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Two of the most heralded aspects of President Barack Obama's executive actions on immigration are stalled in the courts, which means activists' efforts to sign up undocumented immigrants for relief are on hold as well. It's a setback, but immigration advocates are determined to make sure the hard-fought victories of Obama's executive actions are not diminished by the legal hurdles -- or by a deportation apparatus that continues to churn. ""The situation that we find ourselves in is unfair. It has millions of people on hold,"" said Lorella Praeli, advocacy and policy director of the group United We Dream. A federal judge is currently considering a lawsuit brought by 26 states over Obama's deportation relief programs, which he announced in November 2014. On Feb. 16, the judge blocked the programs from moving forward while the lawsuit is pending, and he announced Monday that he won't decide whether or not to reverse that decision until, at the earliest, after a hearing on March 19. The Justice Department asked an appeals court on Thursday to step in within 14 days and overturn the judge's ruling. As a result, the administration cannot start its new program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, which was announced as part of Obama's package of executive actions. DAPA would grant work authorization to some undocumented immigrants who have lived in the U.S. for years and are parents of citizens or of legal permanent residents. The judge's ruling also delayed the planned expansion of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an existing program that gives work permits to certain undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children. Supporters of the stalled policies, from the White House down to community groups, say they are confident they will eventually be able to move forward. Sympathetic members of Congress and activists have continued to hold workshops to publicize the executive action programs and ensure people are ready to apply once they open. One of their goals is to keep undocumented immigrants from being afraid to sign up for DAPA and DACA when the time comes. But immigration activists are also keeping their focus on the present, and making sure those with long-standing ties to the U.S. are not deported.  Praeli said that in spite of the judge's decision, there's still plenty to do. ""It gives us more time to dig into other parts of the announcement and to understand the problems in other areas,"" she said. ""The new enforcement priorities -- how are they being implemented, who is getting apprehended, who is getting removed, what are the practices at the local level. We're busy in a different way."" Her group is operating a hotline to inform people about the executive actions and collecting stories of undocumented immigrants who would be eligible for relief under the stalled policies, but are instead being detained. Across the country, advocacy groups are continuing long-standing efforts to call attention to what they say are unfair deportation proceedings against established community members. Immigrant advocacy groups are also pushing back on the way immigration enforcement has been carried out since the executive actions were announced. In addition to DAPA and the expanded DACA, Obama and Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson in November also announced new prioritization policies for Immigration and Customs Enforcement that are aimed at ""felons, not families."" The idea is that convicted criminals, those who pose national security threats and recent border-crossers should be deported, while immigrants with long-standing ties to the U.S. should not face the imminent threat of deportation. But the ""felons, not families"" construct is controversial. Many immigration advocates note that some people have criminal records only for immigration-related crimes, or are being targeted now for long-ago crimes for which they have already served their time.The #Not1More campaign, a coalition of groups calling for fewer deportations, urged Obama this week to do more to stop police-ICE collaboration while the lawsuit over DAPA and expanded DACA is playing out. One of their concerns is that basing immigration enforcement practices on criminal enforcement is a bad idea, since immigrants often get profiled by police. ""We have a community that's already criminalized,"" said Erika Almiron, executive director of the Philadelphia group Juntos and a member of the #Not1More campaign. ""We also have immigration law that's constructed on a criminal justice system that we know has been already disproportionately affecting our community negatively."" One of the policies included in Obama's executive actions was an attempt to respond to concerns about police-ICE collaboration. The president announced an end to the Secure Communities program, which asked local law enforcement to hold people whom they would otherwise release if ICE requested it. A new policy, called the ""Priority Enforcement Program,"" is to be implemented in place of the controversial program. Advocates applauded the death of Secure Communities, but many are concerned PEP could be more of the same. Last Friday, a coalition of groups held a press conference outside ICE headquarters in Washington calling for more transparency about the program. The activists have also requested more information on PEP through a Freedom of Information Act request.On Thursday, Jessica Karp Bansal of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network issued a statement calling for the administration to stop ""mining the local criminal justice system for deportations in order to meet its ill-conceived and self-imposed quota,"" and hand over more details about PEP before it becomes a failure like Secure Communities was.   ""Without complete transparency and accountability for PEP -- which so far has been entirely lacking -- we are concerned that it, too, will become a dangerous dragnet that undermines the purposes of DAPA and unnecessarily perpetuates the pain caused by our broken immigration system,"" she said.

6,SPORTS,University Professors Form Coalition To Fight For NCAA Pay,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/professors-ncaa-pay-employees-legal_n_6858682.html,They have their work cut out for them.,2015-03-12,"ARLINGTON, TX - APRIL 04: The Wilson basketball with the Final Four logo is seen as the Kentucky Wildcats practice ahead of the 2014 NCAA Men's Final Four at AT&T Stadium on April 4, 2014 in Arlington, Texas. (Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb77a06220000ba01dd12c5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of professors representing universities from around the country announced Thursday the formation of a national coalition dedicated to fighting for the labor rights of college men’s basketball and football players. The group, which is calling itself the College Athletes Rights and Empowerment Faculty Coalition (CARE-FC), released a statement in which it explained at length why the professors had decided to come together. “For decades, the athletes who serve as the centerpiece of the college sport business have been denied access to fair compensation ... adequate health care protections … and avenues to shape, contest, and respond to the rules imposed on them,” the statement reads in part. “As scholars who have studied these issues for many years, we are deeply troubled by the failure of higher education and college sport officials to acknowledge college football and men’s basketball players in major programs as employees with rights to bargain collectively.”The coalition, which consists of 19 professors, at least one of which has blogged for The Huffington Post before, has focused its efforts on football and men’s basketball because, they say, the NCAA and universities themselves openly admit the pressures on and time commitments of the players in those sports are different than the pressures on other student-athletes. “We firmly believe there will be no genuine reform in the college sport industry until college football and basketball players are accorded status as employees with the attendant legal and civil rights that accrue,” the statement reads. “To that end, we stand behind and with college football and men’s basketball players in their efforts to be treated humanely and with dignity.”When it comes to convincing the court of public opinion, the coalition has its work cut out for it. According to a recent HuffPost/YouGov poll, only 33 percent of Americans currently support the idea of paying college basketball and football players, while 46 percent oppose the idea and 22 percent say they are unsure. At the policy level, the fight for NCAA pay has led to mixed results at best. In just the past year, advocates for student-athletes have experienced victories (the Ed O’Bannon antitrust case), losses (pushes in Michigan and Ohio to restrict the labor rights of student-athletes) and waiting games (whatever happened to that Northwestern football union, anyway?).When asked about the coalition, Stacey Osburn, the NCAA’s director of public and media relations, told HuffPost that the NCAA vehemently opposes classifying student-athletes as legal employees, instead focusing on recent improvements the NCAA has made to its current system, such as “ensuring scholarships are not revoked for athletics reasons and more stringent concussion management requirements.”""We strongly disagree with the notion that student-athletes are employees,” Osburn wrote. “While improvements need to be made, we do not need to completely throw away a system that has helped literally millions of students over the past decade alone attend college.""""We want student-athletes –- most of whom will never make it to the professional leagues –- focused on what matters most, namely finding success in the classroom, on the field and in life,” she added. The NCAA recorded nearly $1 billion in revenue in the 2014 financial year and ended up with a $80.5 million surplus. The nonprofit association says it invests 90 percent of its revenue directly back into its student-athletes. "

The research by the University of Southern California Dornsife’s Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration says that permitting undocumented adults to work in the United States legally would help boost their earnings enough to push their households over the poverty line. The Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program, or DAPA, is the farthest reaching of a group of executive actions announced by Obama in November to address the issue of immigration amid congressional gridlock. The program, which officials estimate could benefit about 4.1 million people, allows undocumented parents of U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents to apply for a temporary reprieve from deportation and work authorization. “With more income in the household due to DAPA implementation, over 40,000 children could be lifted above the official poverty line,” the study says. “We also know that one of the single largest factors impacting student learning and future economic performance is parent’s socioeconomic status; for that reason, DAPA seems like the sort of anti-poverty and pro-child measure that should rally politicians from across the political spectrum.” The estimates that total earnings for DAPA-eligible households in California would rise by $1.6 billion per year if the program were implemented. The researchers say extending work authorization to DAPA-eligible migrants would rise in wages to higher earnings in the formal job market, more incentives for job training and greater ease in finding jobs that match applicants’ skill levels. More undocumented immigrants reside in California than any other U.S. state. Some 1.6 million children of people who would be eligible for DAPA live there, according to the study -- a figure that accounts for 17 percent of the total number of children in California. About 93 percent of the children of DAPA-eligible parents are U.S. citizens. A federal judge in Texas issued a preliminary injunction last month blocking the program’s implementation after 26 states sued to overturn the program, arguing that Obama’s executive actions are unconstitutional.

Todd Russ, R-Cordell, amends language in the state law that governs the responsibilities of court clerks. All references to marriage licenses were removed.Russ said the intent of the bill is to protect court clerks caught between the federal and state governments. A federal appeals court overturned Oklahoma’s ban on same-sex marriage last year. Russ, like many Republican legislators in the state, including Gov. Mary Fallin, believes the federal government overstepped its constitutional authority on this issue.Acknowledging that his bill is partially in response to the federal court ruling, Russ told ABC News affiliate KSWO that the federal government lacks the power to “force its new definitions of what they believe on independent states.”Russ said the federal government is attempting to change the traditional definition of marriage, so his legislation would place the responsibility for officiating marriages in the hands of clergy.“Marriage was historically a religious covenant first and a government-recognized contract second,” Russ told The Oklahoman.The legislation has sparked controversy, both in the Legislature and with groups such as Americans United for Separation of Church and State. Oklahoma Democrats are concerned that the legislation will lead to a “Pandora’s box” of issues, including polygamy, once the government’s authority to regulate marriage is removed.Americans United released a statement opposing the bill, saying it is biased against same-sex couples and nontheists, including atheists. Russ has been unapologetic in defending his exclusion of nontheists from the right to marry.“They don’t have a spiritual basis for a marriage and don’t want to have a clergy member or a priest or someone involved in the spiritual aspect,” Russ told KSWO, “then they can file an affidavit of common-law marriage.”The bill would require court clerks to issue certificates of marriage signed by ordained clergy or affidavits of common-law marriage.The Senate has not yet voted on the measure. Nor has Gov. Fallin indicated what she will do if the bill passes the Senate."

The current transportation funding measure, known as the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21), expires at the end of FY 2014 on Sept. 30. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ed58240000300098fcd5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A pair of Democratic senators has introduced legislation to reform the nation's chemical safety laws, two days after a bipartisan group of senators released their own chemical legislation. Sens. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and Ed Markey (D-Mass.) introduced the Alan Reinstein and Trevor Schaefer Toxic Chemical Protection Act on Thursday. The senators said their bill would require the Environmental Protection Agency to evaluate whether chemicals are safe before they are brought to market, would speed up the EPA's process for reviewing chemicals, and would force the agency to review all chemicals already on the market. The bill would reform the 1976 Toxic Substances Control Act, which many have complained is outdated and too weak to protect Americans from exposure to chemicals. It comes shortly after another pair of senators, Tom Udall (D-N.M.) and David Vitter (R-La.), introduced their own legislation on the subject. Many environmental and public health groups have criticized the Udall-Vitter bill as not going far enough in reforming the nearly four-decades-old legislation. The Boxer-Markey bill would also allow states to continue setting tougher regulations on chemicals than the federal standards. California has historically been a leader in tougher standards, and the Udall-Vitter bill would limit states from doing so in the future, which has been a point of contention for Boxer. The Boxer-Markey bill is named after Alan Reinstein, who died from mesothelioma, and Trevor Schaefer, a brain cancer survivor.Boxer has accused the sponsors of the rival legislation of being overly deferential to the interests of the chemical industry in crafting their bill. ""Our citizens deserve nothing less than a bill that protects them -- not chemical companies,"" she said in a statement Thursday.The Environmental Working Group, which has argued that the Udall-Vitter bill ""will only make things worse,"" praised the Boxer-Markey effort. The group said the new bill would hold chemicals in the marketplace to the same safety standards required for pesticides and other chemicals used in foods. ""Americans rightly expect that chemicals in everyday products they use are safe, especially for children who are most vulnerable to toxic exposures,” EWG President Ken Cook said in a statement. “The Boxer-Markey bill would make sure that the nation’s chemical safety law meets that expectation.”Daniel Rosenberg, senior attorney in the Health Program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the bill ""more ambitious and forward-thinking"" than the Udall-Vitter bill. ""This bill gives a sense of how much could be achieved with a full-fledged effort to reform our broken toxic chemicals law,"" said Rosenberg.The Udall-Vitter bill has 17 co-sponsors, including Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.), the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over the legislation. A hearing on the bill is schedule for Wednesday.  "

He could face life in prison if convicted.Patz vanished as he walked alone for the first time to a school bus stop in his Manhattan neighborhood on May 25, 1979. His disappearance sparked a national movement to find missing children, with his picture one of the first to appear on milk cartons.Prosecutors at Hernandez's trial in state Supreme Court in Manhattan focused on the defendant's drug use and on testimony by Dr. Michael First, a psychiatrist at New York-Presbyterian Hospital and witness for the defense.First has testified that he diagnosed Hernandez with a ""schizotypal personality disorder"" in 2012, a few months after he was arrested.Prosecutors tried to cast doubt on that diagnosis, suggesting Hernandez's visions and hallucinations were due to drug abuse and not mental illness.Hernandez used cocaine for 20 years, from 1985 to 2005, First said. The psychiatrist said he considered Hernandez's drug use when developing his diagnosis in 2012 but said it was no longer relevant as Hernandez no longer used cocaine.He said Hernandez's hallucinations have continued while he has been in prison since 2012 without access to cocaine.The psychiatrist described the diagnosis and Hernandez's drug use as a ""chicken and egg"" problem of ""which came first, drug use or the psychiatric condition.""First said symptoms of Hernandez's disorder include hallucinations and problems distinguishing imagination from reality.Hernandez recounted that a voice told him to approach the boy and lure him into the basement of a Manhattan grocery where he worked, the doctor testified.Hernandez also said there were other people in the basement whom he described as old, gray-haired and wearing hospital-style gowns, First said.Patz, whose body has not been found, was declared dead in 2001.

Separately, the Justice Department said it would offer extra training and help to communities that are not part of the project, which is part of the Obama administration's ""My Brother's Keeper"" initiative aimed at minority men.Weeks of protests that followed the shooting of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, by a white police officer in Ferguson, exposed the frayed relations between that community and law enforcement and underscored the need for a nationwide initiative, Holder has said. ""What I saw in Ferguson confirmed for me that the need for such an effort was pretty clear,"" Holder said in a September interview with The Associated Press in which he announced the project.The department last week cleared the officer, Darren Wilson, of criminal civil rights charges in that shooting but also released a scathing report that detailed a slew of discriminatory policing practices in Ferguson and a profit-driven criminal justice system. Since that report, Holder said he has seen signs of progress and a community willing to create change. The police chief and city manager, for instance, both resigned in the last week.He condemned the shootings of two police officers early Thursday in front of the Ferguson Police Department, calling it a ""pure ambush"" and the act of a ""damn punk.""""Incidents like the one we have witnessed throw into sharp relief why conversations like the one that we've convened today and we're going to be having - to build trust between law enforcement and the communities that they serve - are really so important,"" Holder said.----Follow Eric Tucker on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/etuckerAP "

She limited her TV viewing to shows on the Discovery and History channels (if religion consisted solely of archaeological hunts for the ""real"" Jesus and other mysteries of the Bible, LBL would be on board), with an occasional smattering of PBS.When video stores started popping up, LBL could now watch films that she hadn't seen in theaters. But video stores necessitated actually going somewhere to choose the film, and often resulted in walking the aisles reading titles of movies she hadn't wanted to see anyway. Or, she would rush to the video store for a specific film and discover that it wasn't in stock and, instead, purchase a box of microwave movie theater popcorn.Netflix was a revelation. Suddenly, films magically appeared in her mailbox. She never even had to take her pajamas off in order to watch movies she had initially bypassed. Some of them were actually good. But the real magic was the ability to watch TV shows that everyone in the world, except her, had seen and loved.Friends started hurling advice at her. Watch ""The Sopranos""! Watch ""Mad Men""! Watch ""The Wire""! Watch ""Scandal""! Watch ""The Good Wife""! LBL's head was spinning. She and Now Husband took the plunge with ""The Wire."" She was hooked. She was a Netflix junkie, standing at the door and waiting for the sight of the thin red envelope of joy.LBL and Now Husband don't TIVO. They don't subscribe to premium TV channels. They continued to wait patiently for the little red envelope. When ""The Wire"" ended, they watched ""Friday Night Lights,"" ""Treme,"" ""24"" and started ""Mad Men."" They thought life could get no better than this. Until those same friends said ""Why are you waiting for the mail!? You should get Netflix On Demand!""""Mad Men"" was the first show they saw On Demand. One day, they sat on the couch for four hours, watching Don Draper be a handsome, talented asshole, and consuming more alcohol than was imbibed during the entire run of the Roman Empire. LBL didn't know why she was so taken with ""Mad Men,"" since she didn't really like any of the characters on the show. Joan was cool, except LBL spent most of her time being mind-boggled over those breasts. People suggested, ""But doesn't the show remind you of how things were when you were growing up?"" LBL thought about it and suspected it did, minus the money, the alcohol, the cigarettes, the fancy clothes, the nice homes, the cars, the restaurant meals and the fact that people spoke without accents.""Mad Men"" was the beginning of a slippery slope, made even more slippery with the advent of original Netflix productions. Life soon devolved into a nightly stay on the couch. ""Breaking Bad"" was the show that brought LBL and Now Husband into the 21st century. Now they understood what all the fuss was about, although it was tough to get other people excited about talking about a show they had watched several years ago.When LBL and Now Husband jumped onto the current productions, everything changed. Conversations with friends revolved around the bottomless smarminess of Frank Underwood, the ordeals of Piper, the horror of the Red Wedding. Was Brody really a terrorist? What's the deal with the Children of the Forest? LBL and Now Husband were part of the club, if a club could be defined as a place where nobody ever left home.LBL now scans Netflix and Hulu for any shows she can watch when she and Now Husband aren't in front of the TV together. This takes place primarily in the middle of the night and involves primarily a murder (""The Killing"") or serial killers (""The Fall""). These shows have replaced her usual fare of watching reality shows about hospital emergency rooms. LBL isn't sure why death (or the anticipation of or the cheating of) should be so compelling at these times, but it is.Of course, there's ""Downton Abbey,"" which reminds LBL that she is still an educated, cultured human being, although her graduate degree and deep appreciation of culture is often limited to comments like ""Holy shit! That dress is amazing!"" or ""I love Mary's new 'do!"" or ""How is it that Daisy is getting cuter as the show goes on?"" or ""I think there is something seriously wrong with Edith's daughter. Everyone just carries her around and all she ever does is to stare vacantly. ""Just when LBL thought she could stoop no lower with her TV viewing, she and Now Husband have started a new viewing habit. When they are home in the afternoon, around 4 p.m. they tune into ""House of Cards"" in order to watch one episode in advance of their nighttime viewing. As soon as Season 3 was released, they tuned in. But Now Husband inadvertently started Season 1, Episode 1 all over again. After a minute, they decided to start watching the series from the beginning. They are now on Season 2 and take joy in being able to once again appreciate that they have absolutely no idea what is going on (What is it with that bridge, anyway? Why does everyone let Frank push them around? Does Remy have the ability to teleport himself? Do Frank and Claire ever have sex or do they just sit on the window sill and smoke? And, most importantly, where can those ribs be purchased?)LBL envisions countless others, all seated on their couches/chairs/Barcaloungers/beds, spending their evenings staring at a TV/laptop/cell phone screen. She and Now Husband take comfort in the fact that they, like those others, are in a woman's prison/in the White House/in the head of an unmedicated bi-polar/in the Lands Beyond the Wall at the same time they are chomping away on their microwave movie theater popcorn."

The hearing is underway to address the public defender's allegations of a widespread, unconstitutional jailhouse informant program that he feels affects the case of his defendant. (Photo by Mark Boster-Pool/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ed532400003100577972.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LOS ANGELES -- An Orange County Superior Court judge removed the O.C. District Attorney's office from prosecuting a mass murder case Thursday, saying the government had made ""significant"" violations of due process during the case. However, the judge also ruled that Scott Dekraai -- who last year pleaded guilty to shooting and killing his ex-wife and seven other people in a hair salon in 2011, in what remains the biggest mass murder in county history -- will still face the death penalty. Deputy public defender Scott Sanders, Dekraai's attorney, argued that his client should be spared the death penalty, given the egregious wrongdoing he said the government was involved in during the trial.""Certain aspects of the District Attorney's performance in this case might be described as a comedy of errors but for the fact that it has been so sadly deficient,"" Judge Thomas Goethals read from his shocking ruling Thursday in court. Sanders argues that DA Tony Rackauckas' office obstructed justice by withholding evidence that may have helped Dekraai's defense. Sanders also claims that Rackauckas' office covered up for Orange County sheriff's deputies accused of lying on the stand about evidence gathered in the Dekraai case using a controversial jailhouse informant program. ""We respectfully disagree with the court's ruling,"" Susan Schroeder, OCDA chief of staff, told The Huffington Post. ""We will be in discussion with the attorney general in the near future to decide if we're going to exercise our right to appeal the case.""""This is an extremely horrible and sad day for the victims -- our hearts go out to them,"" Schroeder added. ""They are the ones being made to suffer by this ruling.""Rackauckas has maintained that no one in his office intentionally behaved inappropriately.In light of evidence first presented by Sanders during a February hearing, Goethals ruled that there had been ""significant discovery violations"" by the prosecutors that deprived Dekraai of his right to due process and a fair trial.As Goethals read from his ruling Thursday, a visibly distraught Dekraai turned and whispered ""I'm sorry"" to victims' family members who were present at the hearing.Paul Wilson, the husband of one of the shooting victims, Christy Wilson, said he was ""embarrassed and disgusted"" by the actions taken by the DA's office. ""I hope that [DA] Tony Rackauckas and his office are held accountable for this,"" Wilson told the Los Angeles Times Thursday.The sheriff’s department has acknowledged “deficiencies” in its policies and protocols involving jailhouse informants. “As a result, we have already begun to implement some changes in our policy that create more robust mechanisms to document inmate handling,” Sheriff's Lt. Jeff Hallock told HuffPost in 2014, after an earlier ruling from Goethals that found the DA's office had been negligent in its use of information gathered from jailhouse informants.According to Sanders, the Orange County Sheriff's Department placed jailhouse informants in cells with inmates awaiting trial, hoping to collect incriminating evidence. Authorities often deploy informants to help bolster a case -- a tactic that's perfectly legal, even when the informant receives something in exchange.However, in some Orange County cases, the sheriff’s jailhouse informants allegedly recorded conversations with inmates who were already represented by lawyers, a violation of an inmate’s right to counsel. Then, prosecutors presented damning evidence gathered from informants in court, while withholding evidence that could have been beneficial to the defense -- a violation of a defendant's right to due process.Furthermore, Sanders argues that when O.C. Sheriff's Deputies Ben Garcia, Seth Tunstall and William Grover testified about the jailhouse informant program in 2014 and 2015, they lied ""with shocking frequency"" about how the program works and how evidence was obtained. Sanders says that the DA's prosecutors then refused to condemn the deputies' dishonest testimony, and instead ""frequently championed it.""""The lying and deception we saw in this courtroom is unlike the lying and deception we’ve ever seen in courtrooms,"" Sanders said Thursday in court.Tom Dominguez, president of the Association of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs union, said the group ""firmly"" backed the deputies. ""We believe that a thorough appellate review of the record and of the legal requirements will make it clear that the deputies testified to the best of their ability,"" he said. In a scathing 506-page motion filed last year, Sanders argued that county prosecutors had engaged in “outrageous government conduct” by failing to tell defense lawyers certain details of the jailhouse informant program. Informants collected incriminating statements made by the defendants and shared them with prosecutors in exchange for reduced charges or other favors, Sanders claimed.In his 2014 ruling, Goethals agreed that prosecutors engaged in some ""misconduct"" by withholding evidence, but he stopped short of calling it ""outrageous."" The judge also said that some law enforcement personnel who appeared as courtroom witnesses were “credibly challenged.” He said that various jailhouse informants against Dekraai and other murder defendants had “sought and expected consideration” for their testimony and were “each directly or impliedly promised by law enforcement that such consideration would be forthcoming."" On Thursday, Goethals ruled that in light of the alleged misconduct, the evidence presented during Dekraai's upcoming penalty hearing will be limited only to that which directly relates to the 2011 mass killing. That evidence includes statements Dekraai made before he was booked into county jail, as well as statements from people affected by the shooting.Now that the OCDA's office has been recused, the office of California Attorney General Kamala Harris will take over the responsibilities for the remaining hearings in the case. Dekraai's penalty hearing is scheduled to begin later this month.This article has been updated to include the comments of the Association of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs president. "

Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/madonna-gay-fans-_n_6846882.html,,2015-03-11,"FILE - This Feb. 8, 2015 file photo shows Madonna performing at the 57th annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles. Madonna, Rihanna and Sam Smith will perform at the second annual iHeartRadio Music Awards on March 29, 2015, at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, iHeartMedia announced Monday, March 9, 2015. (Photo by John Shearer/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafd7fc250000940037fc60.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over the course of three decades, Madonna has become synonymous with provocation, panache and pop prestige. No less central to the diva's record-smashing career, of course, has been her ardent gay audience. The community has, once again, played a prominent role in the lead-up to the March 10 release of “Rebel Heart,” the Queen of Pop’s 13th album and most musically diverse offering in a decade. To promote the album, Madonna teamed up with the gay social app Grindr, giving five lucky users the chance to chat with her one-on-one. She also tips her hat to those fans on the album’s most self-referential tune, “Veni Vidi Vici,” with the line, “And when I struck a pose, all the gay boys lost their mind.” On the eve of the “Rebel Heart” release, HuffPost Gay Voices and five other LGBT media outlets caught up with Madonna at the offices of Interscope Records in New York. In typical Madonna fashion, the superstar held court in an intimate, all-white music room that was perfumed with eucalyptus oil. She looked fit and glamorous in a flowing black and gold dress, and was as succinct and confrontational as one would expect, directing the individual journalists to form a semi-circle in the room, facing her directly. “It’s better if we all can look each other in the eye,” she said. “I prefer it. I’m Italian, I don’t like anybody behind me.” Although she’s in the midst of a whirlwind publicity tour, the Queen of Pop was in a particularly chatty mood, sharing candid thoughts on “Rebel Heart” and its occasionally troubled history, her gay fans, social media and more. You were forced to change the release schedule for your new album because of the song leaks that took place last year [and earlier this year]. The next time you go to create a new album or film, is your process going to change because of these new threats?  Yeah. I’m never going to put anything on a server and send information back and forth, as it had been done. That was the first mistake. But then the last leak came from the mastering lab, and that was just a technician’s oversight after everything that had happened and everyone knew that we had to crack down and be really super secure -- we were hand-delivering everything -- someone sent the record on the server again, and my hacker is very clever, obviously. So, again, it was not up for very long, but it was snatched, so I would never do anything like that again. Hand-deliver! Did [the leaks] change anything about the way the tracks were sequenced, or…?  It changed everything! First of all, it drove me insane and made me feel an overwhelming sense of anxiety. It made me second-guess everything. Suddenly I thought, “Oh God, everybody’s heard all these demos!” There were some demos that I actually liked the demo version of, and then I thought, “Well, they heard the demo, now they’re going to be expecting other things.” It kept making me think, “Should I change it or should I just leave it how it was?” I was second-guessing everything, rather than having to just choose for myself and put it out, as I would normally as an artist. The way he leaked it and the way the stuff starting coming out and coming out and coming…it kind of drove me crazy, because it started making me think, “I don’t even know what version I should be putting out.” As someone who has always admired your work, I found it devastating, too -- I thought, ""What a horrible thing to do.""  Yeah. And also very confusing, because a lot of things were being sold on my supposed “fan” sites, and I kept thinking…my fans should be supporting me and protecting me so…I don't know. The whole thing confused me. Still does. And what [my hacker] did was a white collar crime. He's in jail in Israel. So I don't even know what's going to happen to him. I hope he goes to jail for a long time, but I don't know what's going to happen. Let's not dwell on that subject! You’ve been such an important part of the gay community for so long. What would be some differences between the gay audiences you see coming out in 2015 versus the audiences you saw in 2005 or 1995 or 1985? How have you seen the community evolve around you?  When I first came up, the whole AIDS epidemic was starting, and… the gay community that I experienced from the beginning of my career was mostly and overwhelmingly concerned with staying alive. I felt really aware of the preciousness of life and time… and people who were HIV positive were treated so badly. I was very disturbed by things, but I also saw a lot of love and connection in the gay community at that time. Like all progress that is made in all marginalized communities or groups, I think, after time goes by and you earn certain rights or you break through certain barriers, you can sometimes take for granted what you have now that you didn't have before, and then that would lead to a certain lack of community in a way. What's your whole perspective on [Grindr and] hook-up culture?  It's part of the modern world we live in. I think that there are just as many a**holes meeting the old-fashioned way as there are meeting in the new hook-up culture. Thematically and lyrically, [“Rebel Heart”] is a lot more self-referential that you have been in the past. During the process of the writing and the production was that something that you did intentionally or was it just part of the process?  I don't know. I didn't set out to write certain kinds of songs, I just set out to write good songs, and that was the mood I was in and that's what I was channeling. Sometimes I was in nostalgic moods and looking back, sometimes I was in the mood to write a song as if I was writing in my journal and reveal certain parts of me that I was ready to reveal. On the song “Body Shop,” the music is folksy and made me think of a lullaby, but then you listen to the words, and they are…   Sexually provocative. Was that your intention to contrast the music with the lyrics?  Was it intentional? No. Again, it just happened. I was working with Tony Gad, who spent a lot of time in India, and … the song has kind of an Indian flavor to it. And I liked the idea of the body of a car as a kind of sexual metaphor. What you do to a car, what you do in a car. So...lots of innuendoes, lots of fun. And we all love a really cute mechanic! If you were a car, what type of car would you be?  That’s a good one. I might be a Bentley. But I might be an Aston Martin, and then I might be a Jaguar, and then I might be a Cadillac. So it depends on what day it is. Can I have a few cars? Can I be a few cars? I'm not a Smart Car. Your music has shaped the lives of multiple generations of pop and dance music fans. When you set out to create an album, do you feel any responsibility to that fan base at all?  I don't feel like I have a responsibility from a sonic point of view, but I do feel like I have responsibility to impart some kind of wisdom and inspiration to people, yeah. We're all very excited about the upcoming tour. Can you give us a preview of what you've got planned?  No. Why would I do that? I want it to be a surprise for you. You've worked with so many people over the years, who has pushed you the furthest as an artist and a performer?  Working with Toby Gad… he really pushed me a lot [as a songwriter]. He was constantly questioning my choice of words, and sometimes I would get really irritated with him. I started calling him an S.S. officer, which he's clearly not. He's the sweetest, most lovely guy ever. He really pushed me, and Diplo really pushed me. He really was particular about lyrics and phrasing and my vocal performances. He pushed me a lot, too. In the end it served me well on this record. You released your “Living For Love” video through Snapchat, and you're doing Grindr and all these different types of social media. Is that going to be a continuous theme throughout the rest of this album?   I like to try new and different ways to present my work to people, so yeah, why not? The “Living For Love” video…I think this was your first time bringing what you do with your tour visuals to a full-on music video concept. Is that also something that we'll get to see again?  I guess so. The thing about that song, it’s such a passionate song, I had to present it in a passionate way. I used mythology to tell that story of the minotaur and the matador and fighting for love and the color red and flowers and horns and death and naked men. You know, the important things in life! I don’t want to make every video the same, but I did love the richness of that video. To me, it felt like a painting that came to life. But I wouldn’t want to do that for every video. Like, when I do “Bitch I’m Madonna,” it's going to be a whole different aesthetic. [Regarding the song] “Veni Vidi Vici,” was it just a trip down memory lane for you?   It was a trip down memory lane. To be in this business for over three decades…I don’t actually think about it that much, but a lot of the people that I worked with were asking me so many questions. In a way, I think I underestimate what I’ve been through and what I’ve witnessed. So I think it was just important to do that … to dwell in a bittersweet nostalgic point. At this stage in your career, what still frightens you?  Ignorance. What are your reading right now?  One is The Goldfinch, and the other is the Bob Fosse biography. Do your kids have a favorite song of yours?  They really love “Bitch I’m Madonna.” That’s my teenagers’ favorite song. My son David, who plays guitar, likes “Devil Pray.” That's his favorite. What do you love most about pop music?  Well, I love how accessible it is. What do you despise about pop music?  Despise? That’s such a strong word. Well, I’m not crazy about how homogenized how it's become. It used to be so much more diverse. Maybe it’s just what’s played on the radio sounds very much the same. But I can’t say, “I despise,” that’s too much. In my house, we don't use words like “despise” and “hate,” we say, “strongly dislike.” This interview has been edited for content and length.  "
28,POLITICS,HUFPPOLLSTER: Clinton Email Controversy Spurs Negative Facebook Chatter,"Mark Blumenthal, Ariel Edwards-Levy, and Janie Velencia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-emails-increased-_n_6846466.html,,2015-03-11,2015-03-11-1426070690-8529208-GallupViewsofNetanyahu.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-11-1426070690-8529208-GallupViewsofNetanyahu.png,"The Clinton email controversy leads to more interaction and a more negative tone about her on Facebook, but are attitudes changing? Democrats sour on Netanyahu following his speech to Congress. And Americans prefer local government to Washington. This is HuffPollster for Wednesday, March 11, 2015.CLINTON EMAIL STORY GENERATES FACEBOOK CHATTER - A Facebook analysis shows a ""huge, sustained spike in the number of Facebook interactions"" about Hillary Clinton since news broke about her use of a private email address while she served as Secretary of State that shows a ""gradual but marked downturn"" in tone. As reported by Buzzfeed's Katherine Miller, Facebook interactions about Clinton had ranged between 151,000 and 319,000, before the New York Times broke its first story about Clinton's use of private email. Interactions with Clinton posts immediately jumped to 1 million on March 3, peaking at 1.5 million on March 5 and declining gradually to 672,000 on March 7 (the graphics in the story initially had the March 7 figure as 672 million; Buzzfeed corrected the error on Wednesday morning). Facebook defines interaction in this instance as people commenting about Clinton on their accounts. [Buzzfeed]As volume increases, tone turns negative - More from Miller: ""The share of conversation about Clinton that was positive dipped from 57% during one period in the fall to 52% in January and then a 50% average in February. By Feb. 28, that sentiment [about Clinton] turned negative, and has stayed largely more negative than positive as conversations multiplied amid debate over her use of a personal email account. The sentiment data is drawn from a Facebook project that analyzes the language and symbols used by the massive social networks users....The sentiment data may not mirror polling data, though it has so far roughly tracked public polls. Her favorability rating has gradually declined, from peak over 60% in 2010, to below 50%, according to a recent New York Times average of public polls."" A measure of opinion, but not a poll - This episode highlights both the promise of Facebook data analysis and its challenge. The posting of stories and comments by millions of Americans, who can explicitly ""like"" what they see, allows for groundbreaking tracking of public opinion in real time. Yet the large spike in engagement means analysts should not track the data as they do opinion polls, which represent multiple measurements of the same population over time. In this case, the recent downturn of sentiment may reflect a change in the population interacting with posts about Clinton, with Republicans and conservatives increasingly activated. It will take standard polling to confirm whether attitudes about Clinton have changed, and not just those talking about her on Facebook. DEMOCRATS SOUR ON NETANYAHU - Jeffrey Jones: ""After Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's much-publicized and controversial address to Congress, Americans' opinions of him have worsened. His [overall] favorable rating is down seven percentage points, to 38%, while his unfavorable rating has increased five points, to 29%. These changes are largely confined to Democrats; Republicans' views are essentially stable. The current rating, based on a March 5-8 poll, came just days after Netanyahu's March 3 address to Congress. Netanyahu's 45% pre-visit rating ranked among the highest Gallup has measured for him....The March 3 visit appears to have soured Americans' -- specifically Democrats' -- views of Netanyahu, though he remains more positively (38%) than negatively (29%) rated overall. Thirty-three percent of Americans do not have an opinion of Netanyahu, essentially unchanged from before the visit. Since February, Democrats have shifted from a 32% favorable/32% unfavorable opinion of Netanyahu to 17% favorable/46% unfavorable. The majority of Republicans, 62%, view the Israeli prime minister favorably."" [Gallup]AMERICANS PREFER LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DC - NJ Heartland Monitor Poll Nancy Cook: ""The most recent results of the 22nd Heartland Monitor poll, sponsored by Alllstate and National Journal...[show] the public favoring state and local institutions over the federal government as the places best equipped to offer solutions to the country's ongoing economic and social challenges. And federal government? Well, it just leaves people wanting more, according to the polling data. Of the 1,000 American adults surveyed, just 26 percent said that national-level institutions were making progress, compared to the 64 percent who favored the state and local levels. This conclusion cuts across the lines of gender, education, socioeconomics, and even different regions of the country. In short, Americans are fed up with the sniping and paralysis at the federal level and instead are turning their attention to local governments and groups for solutions."" [National Journal]FUNDAMENTALS EXPLAIN CONGRESSIONAL DYSFUNCTION - Matt Grossmann and David A. Hopkins: ""Immediately after Republicans gained control of the U.S. Senate in the 2014 midterm elections, incoming majority leader Mitch McConnell pledged that 'there will be no government shutdowns' on his watch. Yet the newly unified Republican Congress took less than two months to force a standoff with the Obama administration over appropriations for the Department of Homeland Security… With Congress facing the exhaustion of the Highway Trust Fund in May, the need to raise the federal debt ceiling by the fall and the end of the fiscal year Sept. 30, more governing crises are possible, and maybe even probable... Republicans have been more ideologically unified and motivated than Democrats for at least 50 years. Given this foundational asymmetry, it is hardly surprising that the Republican Party is particularly susceptible to powerful internal movements pursuing greater ideological purity. The asymmetric nature of the parties is likely to shape the 2016 presidential nomination contests. As long as presumptive favorite Hillary Clinton retains strong support among the social groups that constitute the Democratic electoral base ...she has little reason to fear a serious intraparty challenge from the ideological left...The Republican presidential field, in contrast, will likely be dominated by multiple candidates who each claim the mantle of true conservatism.

This last collection is vast, kept in the daily dredge of my mind.The Dinner, 1993.My senior year of college. I'm out to a Really Nice Dinner (not pizza, not cafeteria food, not... pizza.) The restaurant's rich wood paneling reflecting the soft candlelight on our table, which wore a bonafide white linen table cloth. I sat with three men -- two men I adored (one, my first love and the other, a dear friend) and my boyfriend's father. Laughter trickled from our table, our bodies titled toward each other. The wine and the candle light plumed together and pinked my cheeks. I felt-lit up. Pretty. We ate steak and decadent twice-baked potatoes. My boyfriend's father delivered the news from their hometown and family. We learned that his little brother now had a girlfriend. We're all listening to Mr. Smith, (not his real name) describe Tom's (not HIS real name) girlfriend and suddenly, his eyes fell on me.""She's actually a lot like you, Denise.""I start to fluff up my feathers a bit. I beamed. Then he said,""She's kind and nice and not drop-dead-gorgeous."" (Now, in Mr. Smith's defense, I know my memory has torqued this event, his words.

His dimples-OH! his dimples, slices of heaven revealed when he smiled.One warm spring morning, I walk toward my school. Dewy sunlight spills all around. I realize Adam is walking toward me. ME. My stomach flops and flips and a rush of flush floods my face. He looks into my eyes with his impossibly blue ones and says,""Hi.""""...Hi,"" I reply.He smiles.I smile.""Do you want to go out with me?""The sun is now neon bright, all colors are electric and sounds are so loud.""Yes!"" I say. I can feel my smile broaden, lips making that last effort to rise up and over my braces.A lovely pause, a moment when it's all true and then,""Just kidding,"" he smiles. He turns away.Distant giggles escape from behind a cement pillar. The giggles bound off the sidewalk and pavement and hit me like grenades. Adam walks toward that pillar. Two familiar heads pop out from behind the pillar, heads thrown back in laughter. Apparently, the success of their evil plan and my misery are hysterical.I just stood there.

30,WOMEN,My Mental Collection,"Denise Ullem, ContributorWriter, Universal Grit",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/my-mental-collection_b_6846538.html,,2015-03-11,2015-03-11-1426088557-5149889-ScreenShot20150311at10.44.58AM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-11-1426088557-5149889-ScreenShot20150311at10.44.58AM-thumb.png,"I'll tell you something.I collect a lot things:T-shirts, in towering soft stacks in my closet.Nature's hearts -- rocks, leaves, tiny sea shells-which I keep in a small bowl by my kitchen sink.Quotes that stun me, stop me, inspire me-written on whatever I can record them on or in.New words, written diagonally on scraps of paper to Look Up and Remember, tucked in notebooks, library books, surrounding my desk.Slights, negative words, sentences and thoughts -- anything negative about me. This last collection is vast, kept in the daily dredge of my mind.The Dinner, 1993.My senior year of college. I'm out to a Really Nice Dinner (not pizza, not cafeteria food, not... pizza.) The restaurant's rich wood paneling reflecting the soft candlelight on our table, which wore a bonafide white linen table cloth. I sat with three men -- two men I adored (one, my first love and the other, a dear friend) and my boyfriend's father. Laughter trickled from our table, our bodies titled toward each other. The wine and the candle light plumed together and pinked my cheeks. I felt-lit up. Pretty. We ate steak and decadent twice-baked potatoes. My boyfriend's father delivered the news from their hometown and family. We learned that his little brother now had a girlfriend. We're all listening to Mr. Smith, (not his real name) describe Tom's (not HIS real name) girlfriend and suddenly, his eyes fell on me.""She's actually a lot like you, Denise.""I start to fluff up my feathers a bit. I beamed. Then he said,""She's kind and nice and not drop-dead-gorgeous."" (Now, in Mr. Smith's defense, I know my memory has torqued this event, his words. Maybe it was, ""She's lovely and nice and sorta pretty, kinda like you, Denise."" So while I write this as a quote, it most certainly isn't. But we get his gist: not exceptional, not gorgeous, NOT PRETTY.)Middle School, 1983.Really, I could just end this one here. These two little words stir up such collective angst. I tell two of my friends that I have the biggest crush on Adam (not his real name, either). Ooooo, they gush and Ohhh, we promise we won't tell. I swear I can still see his ridiculously long eye lashes revealing his piercing blue eyes. His dimples-OH! his dimples, slices of heaven revealed when he smiled.One warm spring morning, I walk toward my school. Dewy sunlight spills all around. I realize Adam is walking toward me. ME. My stomach flops and flips and a rush of flush floods my face. He looks into my eyes with his impossibly blue ones and says,""Hi.""""...Hi,"" I reply.He smiles.I smile.""Do you want to go out with me?""The sun is now neon bright, all colors are electric and sounds are so loud.""Yes!"" I say. I can feel my smile broaden, lips making that last effort to rise up and over my braces.A lovely pause, a moment when it's all true and then,""Just kidding,"" he smiles. He turns away.Distant giggles escape from behind a cement pillar. The giggles bound off the sidewalk and pavement and hit me like grenades. Adam walks toward that pillar. Two familiar heads pop out from behind the pillar, heads thrown back in laughter. Apparently, the success of their evil plan and my misery are hysterical.I just stood there. Stunned that the pain was so piercing, yes, but also that this kind of meanness existed.I've even collected negative thoughts that I think people may have thought about me. You may not have known this about me, but I'm a collector of made-up-thoughts-for-other-people.The Beach, Summer of 2014.I walk along my beloved ocean's edge. Hot sun sears my shoulders.

Detractors called the move -- in recognition of the late gay mogul's $1 million bequest to the beleaguered center -- ""insane,"" fearing it would only fuel right-wing allegations about the gay community's obsession with sex. What those critics missed, and what continues to missed over a decade later, is the role pornographers like Holmes played in building the gay rights movement we know today.Several years ago, I set out to make a documentary about Holmes, Seed Money, which premieres this spring. During the process, I discovered how much we, as a community, owe to intrepid smut-peddlers like Chuck who risked their lives to help us live out ours.You see, when the early homophile movement began in the early 1950s, the U.S. government didn't differentiate between homosexual rights manifestos, gay erotica or dirty pictures. All were considered illegal, and using the postal service to distribute any of them could and did result in long prison sentences. So perhaps it's not surprising that pornographers, who had years of experience fighting those battles, were often prominent figures in the emerging homophile movement's leadership. Jim Kepner, founder of the ONE National Gay and Lesbian Archives, was a noted author of gay erotica. Hal Call, one of the first presidents of the Mattachine Society, the pioneering gay rights organization in San Francisco, was an adult film director and owner of the Adonis Bookstore. Rather than be a liability, pornographers could provide a strategic advantage to the movement. They not only knew the legal restrictions (and how to get around them), they had the money to fight the obscenity battles that cleared the way for greater discussions of sexuality. Pornographers were the advance troops of our sexual revolution.Homophile organizations like Mattachine and Daughters of Bilitis had publications, of course, but their reach -- often just a few thousand circulation -- was miniscule compared to that of ""posing strap"" magazines like Physique Pictorial and Tomorrow's Man. It wasn't political tracts, but pornography that provided most gay men with their first connection to -- and awareness of -- a larger gay culture. Perhaps that's why in the early days of gay liberation, porn was embraced as a vital part of our cultural fabric. The very first issue of The Advocate celebrated a court victory won by two pornographers, Conrad Germain and Lloyd Spinar -- who had faced 145 years in prison for sending nudes through the mail -- on its front page. Gay sexuality was dangerous and subversive, and any chance to speak it, explicitly or otherwise, was a strike for freedom and visibility.And at a time when mainstream media portrayed homosexuals as pathological, depressive and criminal, porn offered a sunny alternative. We might scoff at porn theaters now, but looking up at that screen, a closeted man could see a promise of gay life that was open and positive, with larger-than-life men who were bold and unashamed in ways he might only aspire to be.For those who lived outside city centers, that same promise came in the form of mail-order magazines and 8mm loops -- Chuck Holmes' business. As the owner of the legendary Falcon Studios, Holmes had the widest reach of the early pornographers, and he was vocal about creating imagery that would make gay men feel proud of their sexuality. For tens of thousands of closeted customers in small towns across the country, those Falcon films were the ""It Gets Better"" videos of their day.Pornographers contributed in thousands of other ways, of course -- by funding the movement directly, by lending resources and distribution, by educating audiences about safer sex during the AIDS crisis, and by lending their mailing lists to fledgling organizations like the Human Rights Campaign Fund. (Chuck Holmes was a prodigious donor to the HRC, and later served on its Board of Directors.)But as the movement moved more into the mainstream, adult filmmakers were less and less welcome; their contributions pushed back into the closet. Checks, literally and metaphorically, were returned. Despite his tireless work on behalf of gay and progressive causes, Chuck often remained closeted about his business. Even in death, his name and money carried a stigma.It's one reason I chose to make Seed Money -- as a way of talking about what these early gay filmmakers contributed to our culture, and to finally give pioneers like Chuck the recognition they deserve. It hasn't been easy. Some I've talked to still see this history as a black eye on the movement, something that will hurt us in political fights over issues like marriage. But I say if we allow our sexuality to be a source of shame, and hide our history to appease our critics, we're not nearly as out or proud as we think we are.Seed Money: The Chuck Holmes Story, premieres Friday, April 10 at the Boston LGBT Film Festival.

Six months earlier, I'd taken a job at GRACE, which had recently released The Meatrix, a four-minute parody of the Matrix films created to educate viewers about the problems caused by factory farms. Released pre-Facebook, Twitter, YouTube or smartphones, our distribution opportunities were limited; the unwieldy cardboard box I hauled across town was filled with copies of The Meatrix on VHS and CD-ROM -- and I was headed to the post office.Yet The Meatrix was an overwhelming success, ultimately viewed by millions of fans across the globe who shared the movie via email, word of mouth, and, of course, on all the VHS tapes and CD-ROMs I mailed.The response was remarkable given the decidedly unsavory subject of The Meatrix: Factory farms are among the grosser topics one can explore -- especially since these squalid facilities produce the vast majority of the meat, eggs and dairy products that Americans consume every day. But unlike the factory farm documentaries that had come before (think disturbing undercover footage of animal abuse and repulsive imagery of million-gallon manure cesspools), The Meatrix presented the ills of industrial livestock production in a manner that viewers could stomach.Same Fight, New FrontsOn a sweltering afternoon in July 2014, I found myself sweating through my shirt again, this time as I sat at a conference table discussing plans for releasing the 10-year-anniversary version of The Meatrix. As GRACE's founder pointed out, this particular anniversary would not be cause for celebration; although The Meatrix successfully educated millions of people about factory farms, in many ways, the problem had grown worse; over the past decade, factory farms had grown larger and more numerous, consolidation within the livestock sector had increased, and industry had redoubled its efforts to lobby Congress and to confuse the American consumer. Sadly, every point made in the original Meatrix was still completely accurate -- factory farms continue to pollute the environment, threaten public health, abuse antibiotics, devastate rural communities, and compromise animal welfare.GRACE is releasing the 10-year-anniversary version of The Meatrix not as a self-congratulatory retrospective, but as an urgent call to action. While great strides have been made by sustainable food system advocates, factory farms remain a lamentable reality. Nonetheless, as Moopheus notes in the movie, there is a resistance, and it continues to grow.To mark this new chapter of The Meatrix, we've partnered with advocacy organizations around the country to add monthly actions to our website to empower Meatrix viewers to change the food system. The first group we're featuring is Food Policy Action, which has created a Scorecard that provides objective, factual information about how members of Congress are voting on the most important food legislation. Over the course of the next year, we'll continue to highlight the good work of our friends at Meatless Monday and Animal Welfare Approved (the gold standard in sustainably produced meat labels), encouraging Meatrix fans to eat less - but better - meat, and to join us in each month's featured action. Can we harness all the enthusiasm the films have generated over the years to push for a food system that is fair to farmers, healthy for consumers, humane for animals, and good for the planet? We hope so.Stream the new movie at The Meatrix.com, or contact us and I'll mail you a DVD. This post was originally published on Ecocentric blog."

What was the last book you read? These are two of my favorite questions to ask in order to jump start a conversation with an old friend or a new acquaintance.,2015-03-11,2015-03-10-1426007419-8153956-TucsonFestivalofBooks.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-10-1426007419-8153956-TucsonFestivalofBooks-thumb.png,"What are you reading? What was the last book you read? These are two of my favorite questions to ask in order to jump start a conversation with an old friend or a new acquaintance. It always warms my heart when I listen to someone talk about a book they are reading or when I receive a book recommendation. Recently I received two books, one from a close friend and the other from a new business colleague; I eagerly began reading both of them. Truth be told, if you looked beside my bed, you would see that I generally have three or more books in process at any one point in time. I simply love books! I love the feel of a book in my hands and the comfort gained from knowing one is tucked away inside my briefcase or suitcase realizing it is readily available to take me on a journey or provide new information as soon as I open it.Recently I learned that approximately 600,000 to one million books are published annually in the United States with almost half of those being self-published. Often I smile when I think of those that were anxious that ""books"" would go away with the introduction of electronic reading devices. Books are very prevalent in today's society whether in digital or print format. And with that literacy programs are abundant as well as book festivals and book fairs. With the month of February being the ""Love of Reading"" month, I recently learned much about the issue of reading and literacy, recognizing much of it is worth sharing.For example, this week, for the seventh year, the Tucson Festival of Books will take place on the campus of the University of Arizona. More than 450 authors will be on hand with an audience expected to exceed 130,000 people over the course of two days (March 14-15). Authors such as Mitch Albom, Amy Tan, Gail Sheehy, Robert Crais, Dave Barry, Scott Turow, Valerie Plame and Catherine Coulter to name a few will be providing insight into their books, writing process as well as sharing some tips and ideas. But more important to the visitor is the opportunity to touch, feel and look at the books with many available for purchase. The Tucson Festival of Books began in 2009 with 350 authors and presenters while attracting 50,000 individuals over two days. It has grown tremendously while continuing to operate as a nonprofit organization with a mission and focus of improving literacy rates among children and adults. In its mere six years of existence, more than $1 million has been donated to literacy organizations. The Tucson Festival of Books is adding to the resources available for literacy programs and making a difference. What most people don't realize is that reading and literacy are important to a functioning and healthy society. It is estimated by experts that almost 40 percent of 4th graders in the United States are not achieving basic levels of reading proficiency. As you might suspect, the number is higher among low-income families as well as certain minority groups and those who have English as their second language. Experts share that the dire consequence of a child not being able to read is they may never participate fully in American society. Further, it is predicted that their employment opportunities, ""...grow dim and the chance for anti-social behavior increases. In short, they will be viewed as ""problems."" In addition to organizations such as the Tucson Festival of Books, many nonprofits are focused on efforts to improve literacy and get books in the hands of people on a national and local level. Let's take a look at some of them.Reading is Fundamental (RIF) is a nonprofit organization focused on literacy and encouraging young people to read. According to the website of RIF, ""Literacy is the ability to read and write -- is essential to fully developing a sense of well-being and citizenship. Children who are solid readers perform better in school, have a healthy self-image, and become lifelong learners, adding to their viability in a competitive world."" The goal of Reading is Fundamental is to put a book in every child's hands. To many this might seem easy but often for many children books are not available. That is why book fairs and festivals, such as the Tucson Festival of Books, as well as local public libraries are so important in communities.Literacy DuPage is located in DuPage County in Illinois one of the wealthiest counties in the United States. With wealth, many assume that there is no need for a literacy program. But often illiteracy is hidden or looks differently than we would assume it does. Here are three examples of how it could look:1. It is the successful businessman who is a functioning illiterate who always traveled with his wife who interpreted and read everything to him; then found himself lost when she died before him. How would he function on business trips?2. It is the woman in her fifties who couldn't read but walked into a nonprofit organization focused on literacy with the dual goals of wanting to learn to read her Bible and know her letters. She now sees words everywhere, even in her dreams.3. Or the high school dropout who ditched literacy classes his grandpa took him to (dodging out the back door after he was dropped off) until his grandpa caught on and sat in the reception area while he learned. That young man is now in medical school. The tagline of Literacy DuPage is ""Literally changing lives"" and this is done through providing free literacy tutoring for adults in west suburban Chicago in DuPage County. Their tutor training teaches people to help a neighbor read, write, speak, and understand English better. The volunteer tutors of Literacy DuPage have helped thousands of people achieve greater success in life through literacy. Literacy DuPage is definitely making a difference in their community as are other literacy groups throughout the country such as Macomb Literacy Partners and 826 | National. We think everyone can read. But one merely has to think about it to realize that in many communities adults read below a level of functional literacy. Such individuals have difficulty reading a newspaper, understanding simple directions on a prescription, taking a written test for their driver's license...and for a number of them English is their second language.Here are some startling statistics:1. According to a study by the WriteExpress Corporation findings show that low literacy directly costs the healthcare industry over $70 million every year.2. It is projected by the same study 2/3 of students who cannot read proficiently by the end of 4th grade will end up in jail or on welfare. Over 70% of America's inmates cannot read above a 4th grade level.3. Even more shocking is that one in four children in American grow up without learning how to read according to the same study. These statistics should shock us into a new reality and into wanting to do something. Here are my top five (5) tips for making books important, supporting literacy efforts and insuring you will be making a difference: 1. Go to book festivals and fairs like the Tucson Festival of Books; visit with authors of genres you normally don't read with the goal of learning something new. 2. Make donations to local literacy efforts in your community and nationally. 3. Start a book club for kids. Studies show that kids who don't read proficiently by 4th grade are four (4) times likelier to drop out of school.  4. Consider donating the books you have at your home and office, especially those you will not be reading again. You can donate them to a local library, school, domestic violence center, Boys and Girls Club, YWCA, YMCA, Big Brothers/Big Sisters program. The list goes on and on. 5. Make time to read. And read to younger children. People, especially children, will emulate your behavior. BONUS Tip: Visit and/or volunteer at your local public library. They are an amazing resource in your community. Reading is so important. Books are important. Literacy is critical. Become involved. By doing any of these recommendations, you will be assured of Making A Difference (M.A.D.)!"
