0,SCIENCE,High-Speed Camera Captures Amazing Downward And Upward Lightning,Lee Speigel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/upward-lightning_us_57462987e4b055bb11712e52,"Scientists are still mystified about how, exactly, lightning forms.",2016-06-14,"A composite image during two Florida thunderstorms showing (at left) downward lightning discharge as it spreads its ""limbs"" out en route to the ground; and (at right) a rare upward burst of lightning.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576074342200002d00f80f62.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Lightning. Most of us have seen or felt the often dramatic and sometimes terrifying gigantic bolts of electricity streaking through the sky during a thunderstorm.It may surprise people to know that for as long as scientists have studied lightning, it's still a bit of a mystery how, exactly, lightning forms.In May, researchers at the Florida Institute of Technology filmed the video below. They're using a high-speed camera to capture amazing lightning flashes -- downward ones from thunder clouds, as well as rare upward lightning discharges. These striking videos -- with their real-time speed slowed down -- show multi-bursts of lightning seeming to crawl down (or up!) and opening out into menacing, claw-like appendages, culminating with huge bursts of electrical, bomb-like images. Yet each of the lightning events in the videos lasted less than one second.""We know lightning exists, but it seems that the electric field is not large enough for lightning to get initiated,"" according to physicist and principal investigator Ningyu Liu, of FIT's Geospace Physics Laboratory in Melbourne, Florida.""Lightning is an electrical discharge process and we know, to start lightning, we need a very large electric field, which can accelerate free electrons inside the cloud. But so far, from measurements, it seems the electric field inside the thunder clouds is actually not that large. Certainly it doesn't exceed the threshold value to start electrical breakdown,"" Liu told The Huffington Post.Liu explains why it's still a mystery how lightning begins.""It's a very complex process because it's difficult to send electric field sensors in the right region at the right moment,"" Liu said. ""Ideally, we want to put a sensor right before the lightning is initiated to measure the field inside the thunder cloud. But it's very difficult to do that. We can't predict when lightning will begin, where it will propagate and which object on the ground it will strike.""The National Severe Storms Laboratory, located in Norman, Oklahoma, confirms the ongoing mystery over lightning formation:""Lightning is a giant spark of electricity in the atmosphere between clouds, the air, or the ground. In the early stages of development, air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud and between the cloud and the ground. When the opposite charges build up enough, this insulating capacity of the air breaks down and there is a rapid discharge of electricity that we know as lightning.Adding to the unknown factor of lightning is the occasional rare moment when nature's electrical outburst moves up instead of down.The following video shows some of the scarce upward lightning videotaped by Liu and his team:""Sometimes lightning can propagate upward from the thunder cloud tops. It can reach 60 to 70 kilometers [about 40 miles] into the low ionosphere,"" said Liu, referring to a conducting layer of the upper atmosphere that helps transmit radio signals around the world.""For some communication systems, we use this layer to propagate signals from point A to point B. If this ionosphere is modified by upward lightning, then it can produce some disturbances in the communications signals.""Here are more examples of upward lightning from a previous Discovery Channel program, ""Raging Planet"":As fascinated as Liu is researching the mystery of lightning, he cautions everybody not to put themselves in harm's way as a storm approaches.""Lightning, of course, carries a lot of current, charge and voltage,"" he says. ""When current flows through an object, it can produce a lot of heat, which can really cause serious damage.""So, I don't want to be nearby any strike recorded on the video."""

It based that conclusion on an analysis of the country's production of weapons-grade uranium and plutonium recovered from spent nuclear fuel.In revised estimates contained in a report provided to Reuters, the institute's David Albright and Serena Kelleher-Vergantini said North Korea may have added another four to six weapons since then, for a total of 13 to 21 or even more today.The report said the 13 to 21 estimate did not take into account the possible production of additional highly enriched uranium at a second centrifuge plant thought to exist in North Korea.""Nonetheless, this exercise, despite not being comprehensive, shows that North Korea could be significantly increasing its nuclear weapons capabilities,"" the report said, adding that most of the increase could be attributed to the production of weapons-grade uranium.The report came a week after a senior U.S. State Department official told Reuters that North Korea had restarted production of plutonium fuel, indicating that it planned to pursue its nuclear weapons program in defiance of international sanctions that followed its fourth nuclear test in January.Plutonium also can be used to make nuclear weapons.The institute's report said the group independently confirmed activity inside the radiochemical laboratory at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear site.It said commercial satellite imagery from June 8 did not show direct signs, but noted ""indirect signatures associated with plutonium-separation"" there.These included the removal of tanks previously spotted in front of the laboratory's reception building and signs that a coal-fired steam generation plant may have been active on June 8.The report also noted signs of external activity at a site the institute identified as a possible isotope-separation facility that could be used to produce tritium for thermonuclear weapons that North Korea has said it intends to develop.North Korea vowed in 2013 to restart all its nuclear facilities, including the main reactor and a smaller plant at Yongbyon, which was shut down in 2007 as part of an international disarmament-for-aid deal that later collapsed.North Korea announced at a rare congress of its ruling Workers' Party last month that it would strengthen its nuclear weapons capability.(Reporting by David Brunnstrom and Jonathan Landay; Editing by Richard Chang)"

4,POLITICS,Marco Rubio Opens The Door To A Senate Run. Here's Why He Probably Won't Do It.,"S.V. Date, The Huffington Post",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marco-rubio-2016-election_us_575ece05e4b00f97fba8eba9,It's about the money.,2016-06-13,"Marco Rubio has bills to pay, and that could persuade him not to run for Senate again.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) reverses course and runs to keep his Senate seat, he'll face new foes in the form of rival Republicans who want the job, but also an old one: a perpetually thin bank account.Ever since he entered the presidential race a year ago, Rubio has insisted that he had no interest in a second six-year term. He said it was impossible to accomplish anything in Congress, which was why he wanted to run for president.The Florida senator seemed to soften his tone on that decision during a Monday morning interview on Hugh Hewitt's radio program as he talked about the mass shootings in Orlando. ""It really gives you pause to think a little bit about your service to your country and where you can be most useful to your country,"" Rubio said.The GOP primary field in Florida currently includes two sitting congressmen, Reps. David Jolly and Ron DeSantis, the sitting lieutenant governor and longtime Rubio ally Carlos López-Cantera, and self-funded millionaire Carlos Beruff. Recent polls show Beruff and Jolly leading, but neither cracking even 20 percent. Should Rubio decide to jump in the race, the qualifying deadline in the state is June 24, with the primary taking place two months later. But tight deadlines aren't the only thing impeding Rubio's return to the Senate. His newfound sense of duty could also run up against the reality of paying the bills.""I think his instincts are to get out into the private sector and raise his income level,"" said Al Cardenas, a former Florida GOP chairman who has known Rubio since the 1996 Bob Dole presidential campaign.That tension between public office and hard cash has defined Rubio's entire political career, as his salary increased yet failed to keep up with his upgraded lifestyle.As Rubio's power grew in the part-time Florida legislature, so did his outside income, rising from less than $100,000 in 2000, when he was first elected, to triple that less than four years later, after he had secured the votes necessary to become state House speaker. That enabled his move from a $175,000 home in West Miami to a much bigger, $550,000 home a few blocks away -- on which he immediately took out a $135,000 home equity loan.Rubio's upset victory over Florida Gov. Charlie Crist for the U.S. Senate gave him a national profile, but also brought new money woes. The Senate job pays $174,000, which is considerably less than what Rubio had been making in his final years in the Florida House of Representatives. A book deal that delivered more than $1 million in advances let Rubio pay off law school loans and other debts. Yet his decision to liquidate a retirement account for such things as replacing a broken refrigerator in 2014 suggests the book money is largely gone -- even as the mortgage payments on his bigger house and the private school tuitions for his four children remain.Cardenas gave Rubio his first job nearly two decades ago as a zoning lawyer and said he realized, even back then, that Rubio was more interested in his political ambitions than his day job. Nevertheless, Cardenas said he doesn't know how Rubio can afford to stay in the Senate.""My sense is that the circumstances have not changed for him,"" Cardenas said, adding that Rubio's desire to make more money directly conflicted with his political boosters' hopes to keep him in the national spotlight to enable a second presidential run. ""Where he comes out on that, I don't know.""One other factor could be at play for Rubio, Cardenas said: the danger that he might not win. Rubio's popularity took a beating in his home state during his presidential run, which ended with the Florida senator losing his home state to eventual nominee Donald Trump by 18 points. ""If you run for re-election and you lose, your political future is over,"" Cardenas said. ""That's a very significant risk to take in this political climate."""

Jared Polis (D-Colo.) released a statement calling the shooting “a direct attack on equality, diversity, and freedom; It was an act of terror against all Americans.”Polis, the first openly gay man elected to Congress as a freshman and the co-chair of the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, went on to decry the FDA’s ban of sexually active gay men from donating blood. He asked that donors be judged by their behavior — including drug use and unprotected sex — and not their sexual orientation.Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) also spoke out against inequality in the shooting’s wake.“Don’t let anyone tell you that we have full equality in this country. LGBT people are not political wedge issues – we are human beings and we are entitled to full equality under the law,” he said in a statement. “I hope that, in the aftermath of this horrific shooting, our country will move towards greater love and acceptance of all Americans.”Like Polis, Cicilline urged greater gun control, particularly on assault-style rifles like the one authorities say the Orlando gunman legally purchased just days ago.""It just should not be this easy for someone to walk into a gun store and walk out armed with a weapon of war that is designed to kill as many people as quickly as possible,” he stated.Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) also weighed in, but said the focus should be on healing in the immediate aftermath of the attack.“It is my hope that our first response will be to remember our common concern for the victims and those who love them,” he stated.Maloney asked that the public view the survivors of last year's Charleston massacre, which left nine black parishioners dead, as examples of how to move forward.""They did not allow themselves to be defined by the hatred of their attacker and neither should we,” he said.He went on to ask for ""a serious and rigorous conversation about gun violence, terrorism and anti-LGBT hatred in the coming days.”Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) responded to the horror with pride and unity, stating: “I will always be a proud member of the LGBT community and I will always feel proud to live in a country built on the principles of freedom and tolerance. No person or group can take that away.”He noted on Twitter: ""Pride Month is a celebration of love & compassion. That is what will prevail.""Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), the first openly gay person elected to the Senate, said that thoughts and prayers following the tragedy ""are not enough.""""This was not only a horrific attack on the LGBT community, it was an attack on the freedoms we all hold dear,"" she said in a statement. ""The question now for America is are we going to come together and stand united against hate, gun violence and terrorism?""A fired-up Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) demanded that Congress turn their moments of silence into moments of action.""Unfortunately, this body is too chicken to address the epidemic of military-style assault weapons because that would upset the gun manufacturers and special interests,” he brazenly said in a statement.“In the end all we will do is have yet another moment of silence, rather than a moment of action,"" he stated. ""That disrespects the lives of the people who were killed not just yesterday, but every day by gun violence."""

At the Joy Metropolitan Community Church, a predominantly gay congregation in the city, members of the Orlando Gay Chorus led mourners through tearful songs to commemorate the victims' lives.

Wade will be decided before the end of June.,2016-06-13,"Pro-choice advocates face off against anti-abortion supporters during a rally at the Supreme Court on March 2, 2016, as Justices hear a case concerning a Texas law regulating abortion clinics and providers.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575eaac11500002b0073a2d9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As she waits for the U.S. Supreme Court to rule on a challenge to a restrictive Texas abortion law, Amy Hagstrom-Miller said she hopes she will not have to close up to three of the clinics she operates in the state, but is planning for it just in case.Hagstrom-Miller founded Whole Woman's Health, which runs four facilities in Texas that provide abortions and led the legal challenge to the law.She said she has spreadsheets listing staffers who would be laid off if the court allows the law to survive, and is thinking about selling buildings and medical equipment as well as shutting her clinics in Fort Worth, San Antonio and McAllen.""I would be irresponsible if I didn't plan,"" Hagstrom-Miller said in an interview.The Supreme Court is due to rule by the end of June on whether the Texas law, which imposes strict regulations on abortion doctors and clinic facilities, violates a woman's constitutional right to end her pregnancy as set out in the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling. The court has not issued a major abortion-related ruling since 2007.The law requires abortion doctors to have ""admitting privileges,"" a type of formal affiliation, at a hospital within 30 miles (48 km) of the clinic. That provision has been implemented. A second provision, not yet in effect, requires clinics to have costly hospital-grade facilities including extensive standards for such attributes as corridor width, room size, floor tiles and the swinging motion of doors.Supporters of the law, passed by a Republican-led legislature and signed by a Republican governor in 2013, say it was enacted to protect women's health.Abortion rights advocates say it imposes medically unnecessary regulations intended to shut clinics and has dramatically reduced access to abortion in Texas, the second-most-populous U.S. state with about 27 million people.Getting a clear-cut ruling is complicated by the fact that the court is down to eight justices, split evenly with four conservatives and four liberals, following the February death of conservative Antonin Scalia.One possibility is a 4-4 split that would affirm a lower court's decision upholding the law but would not set a national legal precedent that could guide other states eager to pass similar statutes.Because it is unlikely one of the court's liberals would join the four conservatives, there is almost no chance of a broad ruling upholding the law and giving other states a green light to enact similar measures. Numerous Republican-governed states have considered measures that would restrictabortion availability.'NOT A CATASTROPHE'For abortion opponents, who no longer have Scalia to cast a fifth vote to tip the balance in their favor, a 4-4 split leaving the Texas law in place may be the best result possible.John Eastman, a professor at Chapman University School of Law in California, an abortionopponent who filed a brief with the high court backing the Texas law, said if the justices cannot deliver a decisive ruling, ""It's not a catastrophe.""""I'd rather have women's health and safety in some parts of the country than no parts of the country,"" Eastman said.Legal fights over similar laws are ongoing in several states, including Mississippi, Louisiana and Wisconsin.If the court leaves in place the lower-court ruling upholding the Texas law, the number ofabortion clinics in the state would drop from the current 19 to nine, abortion providers said. Texas had 41 abortion clinics when the law was passed.""A 4-4 decision would leave us in the untenable situation where a woman's ability to get anabortion will depend on where she lives,"" said Jennifer Dalven, a lawyer with the American Civil Liberties Union, which opposes restrictive abortion laws.Another possibility is that the justices strike down the law, or invalidate one of the two provisions at issue while keeping the other. It may be more likely that the admitting-privileges provision, already in effect, would survive, while the hospital-grade facilities requirements, which the justices themselves temporarily blocked, would not.Justice Anthony Kennedy could be the key player in any such scenarios, which would require at least one conservative to join the four liberals. Kennedy is a conservative who in past rulings has endorsed Roe v. Wade, but has voted to uphold some abortion restrictions.""It comes down to Justice Kennedy, and during the argument he didn’t show his hand too much,"" said John Seago, the anti-abortion group Texas Right to Life's legislative director, adding that the ruling could give abortion opponents ""ideas about what laws we could pass.""Another possibility is that the court returns the case to a lower court for further proceedings, as Kennedy suggested during March 2 oral arguments.""It's overwhelming for me when I think what could happen if it's not a favorable decision,"" said Dr. Bhavik Kumar, who performs abortions at two Texas Whole Woman's Health clinics. ""I try not to think about it every minute of every day.""(Reporting by Lawrence Hurley; Additional reporting by Jilian Mincer; Editing by Will Dunham)"

15,POLITICS,"FBI Director: 'Strong Indications' Orlando Shooter Was Radicalized, But Not That He Was Part Of Network",Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fbi-director-orlando-shooter-omar-mateen_us_575f0c5fe4b0e4fe5143494f,The gunman expressed loyalties to ISIS and other extremists.,2016-06-13,FBI Director James Comey said the agency would look closely into its past investigation of the gunman who killed nearly 50 people at an Orlando gay nightclub.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575f0d951500002a0073a45b.jpeg?cache=dPkcL2vxzo&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The gunman who carried out the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history on Sunday expressed loyalty to the self-described Islamic State, but also claimed solidarity with bombers who had no ties to the terrorist group, FBI Director James Comey said on Monday. Those statements, Comey noted, add to the confusion about the motives of the man who opened fire on a Florida gay nightclub, killing 49 individuals and injuring many more. The FBI director declined to use the name of the shooter, who has been identified as Omar Mateen, a 29-year-old U.S. citizen. Mateen died in a shootout with law enforcement.The FBI is still investigating why Mateen attacked Pulse nightclub -- including whether he was inspired by anti-gay bigotry -- but Comey said there are strong indications that he was radicalized, and that his radicalization happened partly over the internet. Yet there are no indications thus far that Mateen was part of any network or that his actions were directed by anyone outside the United States, according to both Comey and President Barack Obama.Instead, calls with a 911 dispatcher on Sunday and previous statements that led to a 2013 FBI investigation indicated Mateen had multiple and sometimes contradicting loyalties. Officials now are ""trying to untangle different streams of motivation,"" as Comey put it.Mateen reportedly called 911 around 2:30 a.m. on Sunday, after he was already in Pulse and had begun shooting. He hung up, and then called back and spoke to a dispatcher, according to Comey. When Mateen hung up again, the dispatcher called back and they spoke for a second time. During those calls, Comey said, Mateen pledged loyalty to the leader of the Islamic State group, also known as ISIS. The gunman also expressed solidarity with attackers unrelated to ISIS: Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who carried out an attack on the Boston Marathon in 2013, and Moner Mohammad Abusalha, an American suicide bomber who once attended the same mosque as Mateen and carried out an attack on behalf of an al Qaeda-affiliated group. Mateen first came under investigation from the FBI in 2013, after his coworkers were alarmed by his statements on terrorism, which Comey described as ""inflammatory and contradictory."" Mateen told coworkers he had family connections to al Qaeda; that he was a member of Hezbollah, an enemy of ISIS; and that he had mutual acquaintances with the Tsarnaev brothers, Comey said. Mateen's coworkers reported his statements to the FBI, which interviewed him twice during a 10-month investigation that included looking into two trips he made to Saudi Arabia. The agency determined he had lied about those connections and did not pose a threat, and eventually closed the investigation, taking him off a terrorist watch list.Mateen was not the specific subject of a second investigation, but the FBI interviewed him again in 2014 during an investigation of Abusalha. The agency found ""no ties of any consequence"" between them, Comey said. Comey said he didn't ""know what to make"" of the gunman expressing solidarity to multiple groups and attackers, ""except it underscores the importance of the work we're now doing to try and understand all of his motivations, and if there are multiple, what they are and how to untangle them."" Earlier this month, Mateen was able to legally purchase two firearms he used in the shooting, and the FBI was not notified because he was no longer on a watch list, Comey said. Comey said he had not yet seen evidence that the FBI or other law enforcement agencies should have acted differently, but they would continue to look closely at the matter. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump criticized intelligence efforts in the wake of the attack after congratulating himself for being ""right"" when predicting terrorist attacks. He used the tragedy to renew his call for an indefinite ban on Muslims entering the United States -- even though Mateen was an American-born citizen -- and said Monday that many Muslims already living in the U.S. ""are worse than"" Mateen. Trump also suggested that Obama might have connections to or sympathize with Muslim terrorists. Comey declined to comment on Trump's statement about intelligence or calls for a Muslim ban. But he said relationships with the Muslim community were critical for efforts to combat terrorism. ""They do not want people committing violence in their community or in the name of their faith,"" he said. "

Trump, who launched his presidential candidacy a year ago this week by attacking Mexican immigrants as “rapists” and drug dealers, began receiving obsessive coverage out of the gate, as every outrageous statement fueled news cycles and pushed most of the other Republican candidates to the margins.While news organizations have typically focused on the actual frontrunners in the year leading up to a presidential election, journalists this cycle quickly turned the spotlight on a low-polling reality star quick to make incendiary, headline-grabbing remarks.Not only did Trump enjoy far more attention last year than his primary rivals, a fact clear to anyone who flipped on cable news, but the media coverage was largely favorable and contributed to his rise, according to a new report from Harvard's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.Professor Thomas E. Patterson examined news coverage from 2015, a period dubbed the invisible primary, and found that Trump received an ""unusual"" amount of attention at time when there was little indication by way of polls that he could win. ""Upon entering the race, he stood much taller in the news than he stood in the polls,"" Patterson wrote. ""By the end of the invisible primary, he was high enough in the polls to get the coverage expected of a frontrunner. But he was lifted to that height by an unprecedented amount of free media.""Though Trump certainly received some negative coverage last year, Patterson found the media's heavy focus on him to be beneficial to his candidacy. ""Trump’s coverage was positive in tone—he received far more ‘good press’ than 'bad press,'"" Patterson wrote. ""The volume and tone of the coverage helped propel Trump to the top of Republican polls.""The Shorenstein report cites data from Media Tenor, a firm that analyzes news coverage, and focuses on eight major news outlets: CBS, NBC, Fox, The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Wall Street Journal, The Los Angeles Times and USA Today. Patterson found that each outlet's coverage of Trump was generally favorable.A lot of the favorable coverage stemmed from the media's tendency to focus on the campaign horserace instead of candidates' policy positions. More than half of the coverage of Trump was focused on the horserace and campaign activity, Patterson found, while “only 12 percent of Trump’s coverage addressed his issue stands and political beliefs.”The media didn't adequately vet Trump's business record and failed to challenge some of his most persistent talking points, such as his demonstrably false claim that he publicly opposed the Iraq War before it began.Patterson also looked at the Democratic contest, which “got less than half as much news exposure as the Republican race” and really only picked up as presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) began to shrink late in the year.Though he was largely ignored early on, Sanders received the most favorable coverage of any Republican or Democratic candidate during his unlikely rise, according to the study. Meanwhile, Clinton got the least favorable coverage of any leading Republican or Democratic contender.""Whereas media coverage helped build up Trump, it helped tear down Clinton,"" Patterson wrote. ""Trump’s positive coverage was the equivalent of millions of dollars in ad-buys in his favor, whereas Clinton’s negative coverage can be equated to millions of dollars in attack ads, with her on the receiving end.""News organizations gravitated toward the Trump phenomenon, Patterson concluded, because ""journalists are attracted to the new, the unusual, the sensational—the type of story material that will catch and hold an audience’s attention."" ""Trump fit that need as no other candidate in recent memory,"" he wrote. ""Trump is arguably the first bona fide media-created presidential nominee. Although he subsequently tapped a political nerve, journalists fueled his launch.""Read the full study here.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

More than half of the coverage of Trump was focused on the horserace and campaign activity, Patterson found, while “only 12 percent of Trump’s coverage addressed his issue stands and political beliefs.”The media didn't adequately vet Trump's business record and failed to challenge some of his most persistent talking points, such as his demonstrably false claim that he publicly opposed the Iraq War before it began.Patterson also looked at the Democratic contest, which “got less than half as much news exposure as the Republican race” and really only picked up as presumptive nominee Hillary Clinton’s lead over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) began to shrink late in the year.Though he was largely ignored early on, Sanders received the most favorable coverage of any Republican or Democratic candidate during his unlikely rise, according to the study. Meanwhile, Clinton got the least favorable coverage of any leading Republican or Democratic contender.""Whereas media coverage helped build up Trump, it helped tear down Clinton,"" Patterson wrote. ""Trump’s positive coverage was the equivalent of millions of dollars in ad-buys in his favor, whereas Clinton’s negative coverage can be equated to millions of dollars in attack ads, with her on the receiving end.""News organizations gravitated toward the Trump phenomenon, Patterson concluded, because ""journalists are attracted to the new, the unusual, the sensational—the type of story material that will catch and hold an audience’s attention."" ""Trump fit that need as no other candidate in recent memory,"" he wrote. ""Trump is arguably the first bona fide media-created presidential nominee. Although he subsequently tapped a political nerve, journalists fueled his launch.""Read the full study here.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

I’m the only one here,’” he joked, adding that the fan ""couldn't have been nicer."" The actor received a text from his manager the next day, alerting him that he had unknowingly taken a picture with Britney Spears and it had received thousands of likes after she posted it to her social media. “No, I didn’t know it was her!

The answer is probably obvious: As a young teen with swoopy bangs, a moody MySpace page, and a penchant for hating all things school-related. I, too, bumped the twin duo on my chunky iPod in the early '00s.With their latest release ""Love You to Death,"" Tegan and Sara have come a long way musically, while continuing to be monumentally vocal and inspirational for those within the queer community. We caught up with the band in the futuristic New York concert space Samsung 837, where they kicked off the venue's ultra-hip summer concert series.You guys were recently on James Corden's ""The Late Late Show"" the other day. Can you talk a little bit about that performance and what it was like?Sara: OK, so two interesting things. The one thing that was really exciting was, first of all, the other guests. A lot of time, it's guests that you're like, ""Oh, it's that person. That's cool."" But, Ben [Schwartz], who was on the show ... I just scored a film, and he's one of the leads in the film that I scored, so I mean, I've memorized that man's face. He's so familiar to me that [it] feels incredibly intimate now. We were excited.Tegan Quin: He was also promoting his last episode of ""House of Lies,"" so we were excited to see him.Sara: ... And then Linda [Cardellini] who's on ""Freaks and Geeks"" ... We were basically like, ""Are you kidding?!""Yeah, her in that role was life-changing for me.Sara: Another thing ... We asked them, because we had just done Fallon and had just sung ""Boyfriend"": ""Can you help us make it unique and different from what we just did two weeks ago?"" They brought the whole audience up to the stage and let the whole audience stand around onstage. So, we were able to almost perform ... to me, it feels like a live performance. James is also hilarious.Tegan: Yeah, he came and hung out with us for a minute before the show. We were telling him how he was on our list of things that we wanted to do with this record. He was like, ""That's so nice."" We said, ""Our dad -- of course, our family is ecstatic at our success -- he in particular was so thrilled when he heard we were doing James Corden."" And Sara was like, ""Well, he [asked] if we were doing 'Carpool Karaoke.'"" And we said no. And he said, ""Oh"" [in a disappointed tone]. James burst out laughing.So, you would be down to do ""Carpool Karaoke""?Tegan: Yes. I think what's so amazing [about James Corden] is that he's getting the kind of artists that maybe wouldn't necessarily go on and play a TV show to do something really unique and different. I actually don't know what an Adele or a Sia [do]. Their voices are just so amazing. He was telling us about the Broadway one and how they had to do it a second time because they were so bloody loud. He was saying how it was blowing the microphones because their voices were so powerful, and I'm like, ""Yeah, I don't want to follow that.""What's your favorite one?Sara: Justin Bieber.Tegan: Wait, the first one or the second one?Sara: The first one ... Where he's eating fries in it.Tegan: I think the Adele one is magic. She can do no wrong. I recently saw your Vulture article where you talked about your favorite songs that you've done. Your sound has changed a lot -- how has that changed your relationship with your fans, and what you've noticed over the course of the few years?Sara: Tegan and I always say how if you let the fans ask the question, almost always the first question we will get from the audience is, ""Tegan, what's your favorite Sara song?"" and ""Sara, what's your favorite Tegan song?"" There's this interest to know what we like about our music, or which song we like of each other.When you think about your catalog and the songs you're most proud of, [the article] was exciting ... I think because we have such a respect for our older material, even though we've transitioned and sort of evolved into this new sound, one thing is that we will never leave that other music behind. It's important to us to continue to honor those older records and give an opportunity for our fans to hear them, even if we change them slightly ... We're doing a version of ""Back In Your Head,"" for example, tonight; there's no acoustic guitar. It's not immediately the most recognizable version of the song, but all the things that should be there are there. Bass line is there. The melodic piano hook is there. The vocal harmonies are still the same.Yeah, you're still you.Sara: We're still trying to be a band that, even if you found us 15 years ago, you still love us ...The truth is, we don't really listen to a lot of rock music anymore, so it makes sense to us that we would have transitioned our sound a bit, but for people who are listening to rock music and still want us to be a rock bad, I think there's no good answer. There's no, ""Well, how do we make them like us?"" They don't like that music. They don't like pop music. So we try to offer alternative versions, acoustic versions ... We still do our storytelling, detail. We still care about that stuff. So, you would say that your fans are super important to you. But sometimes do you feel like you get in your head about that? For me, I would be [overly analytical] and always nervous.Tegan and Sara: Yes! Sara: If we felt like we were doing something that was truly making people unhappy, we would step in ... So, I think that's what allows us not to act from a place of fear. We work from excitement and joy and challenging ourselves and others. We make music we really believe in. I think it also comes off sincerely.Tegan: The most common feedback since we transitioned from guitar-focused music has been, ""We wish you more guitar-focused."" We didn't just accidentally end up with a record and were like, ""Oh, shit! We forgot to do the guitars!"" 👏 👏 👏 👏 ""Love You to Death"" is out now."

Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) is pushing back on ""meatless Monday"" campaigns by introducing amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act that would ban the campaign from Defense Department cafeterias.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575f14232200002e00f80b26.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) has beef with the idea of military personnel participating in “meatless Mondays,” and last week introduced amendments to the National Defense Authorization Act that would ban the initiative from military cafeterias.The idea of meatless Mondays -- forgoing meat one day a week to promote the health and environmental benefits of a vegetarian lifestyle -- has been gaining traction throughout the U.S. and has earned support from organizations including the Humane Society of the United States.The U.S. military does not currently participate in meatless Monday, nor has there been any evidence that any branch intends to enforce it anytime soon. The U.S. Coast Guard Academy in Connecticut started a meat-reduction program several years ago, and recently began working on the initiative with the HSUS. Several veteran-affiliated organizations have embraced the meatless Monday idea in the last few years as well, including the Veterans Health Administration and New York state's Veterans’ Wellness publication. The Norwegian military adopted meatless Mondays in 2013. But Ernst wants to make sure there will never be a formal program barring Monday meat-eating at U.S. military establishments. She told agricultural consulting business Pro Ag that meatless Mondays are “misguided,” according to Politico. She contended that “our men and women in uniform should have the option to consume the protein they need, including meat, on a daily basis.” Her amendments are scheduled for a vote in the Senate on Tuesday.Ernst served in the Army Reserve and National Guard for 23 years, and grew up on a farm. Her state is a leader in meat production -- which makes some people question if Ernst’s opposition to meatless Mondays is about a different kind of pork entirely.“This whole issues makes me wonder is Sen. Ernst is putting Iowa agribusiness interests over our interest in our military,” Paul Shapiro, vice president of farm-animal protection for HSUS, told The Huffington Post. Ernst received almost $200,000 from agribusinesses during her 2014 senatorial campaign. Ernst cites the 2015 federal dietary guidelines to support her argument that members of the military need meat-based options to fulfill their daily protein requirements. However, those dietary guidelines contradict themselves when it comes to recommending how much meat a person should eat. They do not explicitly limit a person’s daily recommended amount of red meat or processed meat, but they do point out that lower meat consumption is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.The Coast Guard Academy has cut its meat consumption by 10 percent in the last three years but began officially collaborating with HSUS last year, according to Shapiro. The organization paired up with the academy’s executive chef, Michael Cummins, to create meals with meat alternatives: For example, substituting beans for chicken in burritos and serving spaghetti with marinara sauce instead of meatballs. More people making such substitutions could held combat the country's “too fat to fight” issue, Shapiro suggested -- currently, 1 in 3 young people in the U.S. are reportedly too heavy to serve in the military.A plant-based diet is often cheaper than one that's meat-based, so practicing meatless Mondays could have financial benefits as well, Shapiro said. Shapiro is skeptical that Ernst’s amendments will pass the Senate, although he was hesitant to make any predictions.“I’ve learned that it’s bad to predict, but I think that this is such a wacky proposal that I have a feeling that it won’t go far,"" he said. Ernst’s office did not respond to a request for comment. UPDATE: 6.14 -- The Senate did not vote on Ernst's meat amendment Tuesday, but did pass the NDAA by a vote of 85 to 13."

The case, titled Puerto Rico v. Franklin California Tax-Free Trust, centered on whether the island is excluded from some aspects of federal bankruptcy law, but not others.The U.S. Bankruptcy Code generally precludes Puerto Rico, unlike the states, from seeking bankruptcy protection for its municipalities and public corporations. A 1984 congressional amendment established that Puerto Rico is not considered a ""state"" for the purpose of such protections.Elsewhere, federal law bars “states” from enacting their own municipal bankruptcy laws.In court, Puerto Rico argued that by excluding the island from the definition of “state” for the purpose of extending federal bankruptcy protections to its municipalities, the law effectively excluded the island from all federal bankruptcy provisions that apply to states. That would mean Puerto Rico is free to pass its own bankruptcy law to fill the void.Puerto Rico’s creditors contended, however, that federal law can simultaneously consider the island a ""state” when it comes to prohibiting local bankruptcy measures and deny that Puerto Rico is a “state” when it comes to accessing federal bankruptcy protection.The Supreme Court’s majority opinion, written by Justice Clarence Thomas, accepted the creditors' argument, even as it acknowledged the gravity of Puerto Rico’s debt crisis. Thomas wrote that the text of federal bankruptcy law declares that Puerto Rico is not a ""state"" specifically for the purpose of extending bankruptcy protection to municipalities -- and that's it.“The plain text of the Bankruptcy Code begins and ends our analysis,” he wrote.If Congress had wished to exempt Puerto Rico from the entire federal bankruptcy law, it would have said so explicitly, Thomas added.“Congress ‘does not, one might say, hide elephants in mouseholes,’” he wrote, quoting a 2001 Supreme Court case holding that Congress would not change the fundamental meaning of a law through vague language.Thomas' majority opinion was joined by two of his liberal colleagues, Justices Stephen Breyer and Elena Kagan, and two of his conservative bench mates, Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy. (Justice Samuel Alito recused himself from the case.)That breakdown comes as something of a surprise since all four liberal justices appeared sympathetic to Puerto Rico’s side during oral arguments in April. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, whose parents were born in Puerto Rico, wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.Sotomayor was receptive to Puerto Rico’s argument that only entities considered a “state” for the purposes of extending bankruptcy protections to municipalities are subject to the rest of the law’s provisions. The statehood definition in that one clause determines how other aspects of the law apply to Puerto Rico, according to Sotomayor.Since Congress denied Puerto Rico the same federal bankruptcy powers as the states have in 1984, it ""excluded Puerto Rico from Chapter 9 for all purposes -- it shut the gate and barred it tight,"" Sotomayor wrote.She emphasized that the majority’s ruling that federal bankruptcy law pre-empts Puerto Rico’s local bankruptcy legislation has “real-world consequences.”""Congress could step in to resolve Puerto Rico’s crisis. But, in the interim, the government and people of Puerto Rico should not have to wait for possible congressional action to avert the consequences of unreliable electricity, transportation, and safe water—consequences that members of the Executive and Legislature have described as a looming 'humanitarian crisis,'"" Sotomayor wrote. ""Statutes should not easily be read as removing the power of a government to protect its citizens.""Puerto Rico's government had hoped the local bankruptcy measure would give it another tool in its struggle to emerge from a fiscal crisis that has forced it to dramatically reduce public spending and raise taxes. The island’s public utilities bear $20 billion of its $70 billion in debt. The Supreme Court's decision will add pressure on the Senate to pass the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act -- or PROMESA, for short -- which passed the House with bipartisan support last week. The bill would create a financial oversight board empowered to help the island rebuild its economy and restructure its debts, including through a court-supervised process that could force resistant creditors to accept losses. Puerto Rico faces a $2 billion debt payment on July 1 that it likely can't afford to pay.“This decision demonstrates how important it is that the Senate passes Puerto Rico debt legislation as soon as possible,” Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA, a religious anti-poverty organization, said in a statement.Monday's ruling is also the Supreme Court's second consecutive decision circumscribing Puerto Rico’s control over its own affairs. A 6-2 majority ruled on June 9 that Puerto Rico could not prosecute two criminals that the U.S. had already prosecuted in federal court, because the island’s authority to prosecute comes from Congress.Taken together, the two decisions could inspire action by the political forces in Puerto Rico seeking greater independence from the United States, through statehood or other means."

Puerto Rico faces a $2 billion debt payment on July 1 that it likely can't afford to pay.“This decision demonstrates how important it is that the Senate passes Puerto Rico debt legislation as soon as possible,” Eric LeCompte, executive director of Jubilee USA, a religious anti-poverty organization, said in a statement.Monday's ruling is also the Supreme Court's second consecutive decision circumscribing Puerto Rico’s control over its own affairs. A 6-2 majority ruled on June 9 that Puerto Rico could not prosecute two criminals that the U.S. had already prosecuted in federal court, because the island’s authority to prosecute comes from Congress.Taken together, the two decisions could inspire action by the political forces in Puerto Rico seeking greater independence from the United States, through statehood or other means."

Trump said in New Hampshire, following a shooting at a gay club in Orlando, Florida, over the weekend. ""Clinton wants to allow Radical Islamic terrorists to pour into our country — they enslave women, and murder gays. I don’t want them in our country.""The gunman, who was an American citizen born in New York City, reportedly declared his allegiance to the Islamic State militant group before carrying out Sunday morning's massacre. Trump, however, didn't sound very comfortable with a public display of affection between two men in May of 2014, after Michael Sam kissed his boyfriend on national television in celebration of becoming the first openly gay football player drafted by the NFL. “And you know, I don’t know — if everyone thinks that’s a wonderful thing, I guess that’s fine with me. But it looked pretty out there to me,"" Trump said of the kiss in an interview on Fox News' ""Fox and Friends.""The mogul later added, “I’ve heard many people — I’m not even speaking for myself, but I’ve heard many people that thought the display after he was chosen was inappropriate. And whether or not it was, I don’t know. But it was certainly out there a little bit. And I’m very happy that he got chosen, I’m all for it. I think it’s great actually that he got chosen. I hope he does so well. But I thought when he — he was really going at it... I haven’t seen anything like that in a while.”LGBT voters support Clinton over Trump, 84 percent to 16 percent, according to a recent Whitman Insight Strategies survey. Over the weekend, Trump also assured a conference of Christian conservatives that he opposes marriage equality.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

It's the only institution of the 15 surveyed in which most people polled -- 55 percent -- express little or no confidence.""Congress has the ignominious distinction of being the only institution sparking little or no confidence in a majority of Americans,"" the study's author, Jim Norman wrote.But Congress can take a little bit of encouragement from the survey, which sampled more than 1,000 people in the first week of June. Nine percent is better than the 7 percent confidence rating the institution scored in 2014, and the 8 percent it scored last year.Overall, the lack of confidence in Congress reflects a decade-long dip in how citizens feel about most major U.S. institutions, with the average confidence score falling from 38 percent in 2006 to 32 percent in 2016.The institution that scores the best marks for public confidence is the military, with a 73 percent rating. Next is small business at 68 percent, followed by police at 56 percent.Another institution in no position to brag is the media. Since 2006, the percentage of respondents expressing ""a great deal"" or ""quite a lot"" of confidence in television news has fallen from 31 percent to 21 percent, and confidence in newspapers has fallen from 30 percent to 20 percent. The silver lining for the media is that around 40 percent of Americans still have some -- if not a lot -- of confidence in TV and newspapers.""Americans clearly lack confidence in the institutions that affect their daily lives: the schools responsible for educating the nation's children; the houses of worship that are expected to provide spiritual guidance; the banks that are supposed to protect Americans' earnings; the U.S. Congress elected to represent the nation's interests; and the news media that claims it exists to keep them informed,"" wrote Norman."

The group's vehement opposition to restrictions on even the heaviest weaponry available has allowed people on the no-fly list to buy guns.""I just came from a meeting today in the situation room, in which I've got people who we know have been on ISIL websites, living here in the United States, U.S. citizens,"" Obama said at the town hall, using another name for the Islamic State group. ""And we're allowed to put them on the no-fly list when it comes to airlines, but because of the National Rifle Association, I cannot prohibit those people from buying a gun.""""This is somebody who is a known ISIL sympathizer, and if he wants to walk into a gun store or a gun show right now and buy as many weapons and ammunition as he can, nothing's prohibiting him from doing that even though the FBI knows who he is,"" the president said.The scenario Obama described as a possibility has now come true. Omar Mateen, 29, bought a semi-automatic rifle and a handgun less than a week before he killed around 50 people at a gay nightclub in Florida. Mateen had been investigated by the FBI twice -- once in 2013 and again in 2014 -- but was still legally allowed to obtain the weapons.Mateen had called 911 on Sunday to say he was affiliated with the Islamic State, although U.S. officials have said there isn't any evidence he actually has a direct link to the terrorist group. The New York Daily News also lambasted the NRA in its Monday cover story of the shooting. The outlet posted a headline reading ""THANKS NRA"" alongside images of the paper's other pointed front pages from past mass shootings.Despite the president's call for ""common sense"" gun control, there have been 133 mass U.S. shootings in the 164 days of 2016. The event in Orlando was the deadliest such attack in U.S. history.H/T Twitter/RickyFTW"

Last week, HuffPost conducted a survey to see how opinion on gun control had stabilized in the absence of recent high-profile mass shootings. (That's not to say without violence. Among the fatal shootings to make headlines in the four days since the poll started running: a 22-year-old singer was killed after a concert in Orlando, seven people were killed in Chicago, and a man killed his wife and four daughters in New Mexico.)Of the 1,000 people who took the survey, all but one completed it before the Orlando attack.In many ways, the survey's results look similar to those conducted directly following tragedies, although they represent a modest ebb in support for gun control since the attacks in San Bernardino, California, in December. Americans are generally in favor of stricter gun policies, but unconvinced that there's the political will to pass new laws to implement them.A 52-percent majority called gun violence a very serious problem, and 48 percent wanted stricter gun laws -- down 6 and 7 points since the San Bernardino shootings, respectively. Twenty-six percent said in the latest poll that the laws shouldn't be changed, while 18 percent wanted laws that were less strict. The public was almost evenly divided whether it's politically possible to pass stricter gun laws, with 39 percent saying that it is, and 36 percent that it's not. Thirty percent said that mass shootings are just a fact of life in the U.S, while 51 percent believed that the attacks can be stopped. After San Bernardino, 46 percent thought that new gun laws were a possibility, and 58 percent that mass shootings could be stopped. The survey also offers some hints about how the issue of gun violence could play out in the upcoming election. Forty-two percent of registered voters said they trusted the Republican Party more to handle issues related to guns, while 39 percent had more faith in the Democratic Party. But voters in both parties place about equal importance on the topic. Forty-four percent of Democratic voters, and 45 percent of Republican voters, say the issue will be very important to their vote.Partisan divides over gun control have become increasingly stark in recent years. While less than a decade ago, Republicans and Republican-leaning independents were evenly split on whether gun rights or gun control was more important, the GOP has soured dramatically on gun control since President Barack Obama took office.Seventy-six percent of Democrats and 42 percent of independents, but just 17 percent of Republicans, favored stricter guns laws, the survey found. Democrats were 39 points likelier than Republicans to call gun violence a very serious problem.While Democratic beliefs have remained relatively stable in recent HuffPost/YouGov polls, the level of Republican support was dramatically lower in the latest survey. That 17 percent support among Republicans is down from 26 percent after the San Bernardino shootings, and 27 percent after last year's fatal shooting of two journalists on live television.The survey results can't predict how people will react to a shooting that, even against a grim tapestry of precedent, remains remarkable for its scope -- or how much of an effect on public policy or the presidential election a shift in opinion will even have. Support for gun control spiked after the Newtown shootings and, to a lesser extent, after the San Bernardino attacks, but soon faded away, while other attacks have failed to provoke as much response. The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted June 9 through June 12 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

More details on the polls’ methodology are available here.Most surveys report a margin of error that represents some, but not all, potential survey errors.

We're going to ultimately declare a war on Islamic supremacists and we're going to say, if you pledge allegiance to ISIS, you are a traitor and you have lost your citizenship. And we're going take much tougher positions. In the late 1930s, President Franklin Roosevelt was faced with Nazi penetration in the United States. We originally created the House Un-American Activities Committee to go after Nazis. We passed several laws in 1938 and 1939 to go after Nazis and we made it illegal to help the Nazis. We're going to presently have to go take the similar steps here.The Special Committee on Un-American Activities was formed in 1934 to investigate Nazi propaganda and organizations spreading propaganda inside the U.S. It later shifted its focus, investigating disloyalty and subversive activities by U.S. citizens. By 1945, however, the panel was largely focused on investigating purported communist ties -- using its power to subpoena and blacklist Hollywood actors, screenwriters and directors. It is commonly associated with Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.), whose notorious witch hunts against purported communist agents earned him censure by the U.S. Senate.In 2011, Gingrich said the committee was ""absolutely"" a good idea ""when it was created.""The gunman in the Orlando shooting was Omar Mateen, an American citizen who reportedly declared his allegiance to the Islamic State militant group before carrying out Saturday night's massacre. Mateen was killed by a SWAT team. President Barack Obama has said there's no clear evidence that Mateen was acting as part of a larger terrorist network.The mass shooting, the deadliest in U.S. history, prompted a stir in the 2016 presidential campaign over the weekend.Trump responded with tough-sounding bromides but little else, calling for ""strength"" and ""strong surveillance,"" more bombing in the Middle East and efforts to ""knock out"" the Islamic State's internet capabilities. He also implied, not for the first time, that Obama is somehow sympathetic or even connected to Muslim terrorists -- a charge that a House investigative committee on terrorist sympathizers, like the one proposed by Gingrich, might be tasked with looking into.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.How to help:"

She was 96. Waldo's daughter, Lucy Lee, confirmed to ABC News that her mother died on Sunday morning. Lee told ABC that her mother was diagnosed with a benign brain tumor five years ago that was inoperable. Waldo was born in Washington in 1920. She got her first acting role -- she was uncredited -- in the 1938 film ""Cocoanut Grove."" She also did plenty of work in radio. In 1952, the actress appeared on an episode of ""I Love Lucy"" and continued to make cameos on other shows such as ""The Andy Griffith Show"" and ""Get Smart."" In 1962, Waldo would step into her most famous role as teenager Judy Jetson on the Hanna-Barbera animated series ""The Jetsons."" The show aired from 1962 to 1963 before returning for two more seasons in 1985 until 1987. Waldo also voiced Judy in the 1988 TV movie ""Rockin' with Judy Jetson"" and the 1990's ""Jetsons: The Movie."" Waldo played the character until she was 70 years old.Aside from appearing on the future-set cartoon show, Waldo lent her voice to a number of characters including Josie of ""Josie and the Pussycats,"" Penelope Pitstop of ""Wacky Races"" and Morticia Addams on ""The Addams Family."" In 2000 she reprised her role as Penelope Pitstop for a ""Wacky Races"" video game. Waldo was married to writer and director Robert E. Lee from 1948 until his death in 1994.

Pulse, like any other gay or queer-friendly club, is a safe place for gay men. For gay women. For gay men and women of color. For trans and gender nonconforming people. For anyone who needs a reprieve from the looming hands and eyes of straight dudes who don't always understand the word, ""No.""Over the last few years, the concept of a ""safe space"" has been repeatedly taken to task. And some of the most vocal detractors are straight, white men -- a group of people for whom these safe spaces for pretty explicitly not designed for. Last September, The Atlantic published a widely-circulated piece, ""The Coddling of the American Mind,"" in which two white men accused everyone else of being hyper-sensitive. Millennials take a lot of heat online, but it feels like straight, male academics especially love to call millennials ""highly sensitive,"" ""self-absorbed,"" and ""feeble,"" for daring to request spaces free of misogyny, homophobia or racism. And of course, there is Twitter, where the deploring of the oversensitive millennial comes less from academics, and more from conservative white dudes who equate a need for safe space to ""liberal insansity.""As we tragically learned this weekend, marginalized communities are still not safe from hatred and bigotry. In the wake of Orlando, we need and deserve these safe spaces more than ever. Because make no mistake: many of the people who lament safe spaces are likely the same gun-loving fear mongers who are so afraid of their neighbors that they cannot physically part with their assault weapons; the same people who rush to purchase more guns after every mass shooting, because they are actually full of fear that they may have to separate themselves from the machine that has senselessly murdered elementary school students, movie-goers, people seeking health care at a Planned Parenthood clinic, and churchgoers.This widespread hatred, simmering just under the surface -- or out in the open -- among some Americans, should no longer be surprising. Just look at the schoolyard bully who has managed to become the current Republican presidential candidate, whose fear is so acute that he actually needs to erect a wall around it.Many straight men still don't understand that it is guys who look and sound like them who are sources of fear for so many marginalized groups. That when I want to walk down the street hand-in-hand with a woman I don't do it to be whistled at like a dog, catcalled and kissed at. That when a man kisses another man he is not a threat, and he does not deserve to be hated and feared. That when a trans woman wants to use the restroom, she's much more likely to be attacked than to attack somebody else. That their slinging of assault rifles doesn't make anyone but themselves feel safer.Members of marginalized communities deserve a place to get away from the sheer volume of threatening, toxic masculinity. Give us four walls and a roof where we can dance without uninvited straight mens' hands on our bodies, where gay men can kiss without the fear of being seen as repulsive, and gay women can kiss without it being a straight dude's pornographic fantasy.Consider that what we are asking for is nothing much at all: a space to be ourselves. If you are a straight man disgruntled by a marginalized group's need for a safe space, let me explain something to you on behalf of everyone who is tired of being shot and groped and mocked and told to smile and followed and harassed and humiliated:We are not a threat to you. You are a threat to us. And we are allowed to want to be safe. "

His father, Seddique Mateen, has claimed that his son became upset after seeing two gay men kissing in Miami a few months ago. Pulse was a haven for Orlando's LGBTQ community. Muslim organizations and activists across the country have spoken out against the shooting, explicitly calling it a hate crime.Rasha Mubarak, regional coordinator for Orlando's branch of Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), an advocacy organization, said in a statement: “We condemn this monstrous attack and offer our heartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of all those killed or injured. The Muslim community joins our fellow Americans in repudiating anyone or any group that would claim to justify or excuse such an appalling act of violence.”Hassan Shibly, chief executive director of CAIR-Florida, called for unity in a Facebook video, saying that it was important not to allow politicians to use this attack to ""promote fear, division and hate"" within America. ""America is one of the best places in the world to be a practicing Muslim -- to be Jewish, to be Christian, to be atheist, to be whoever you want to be, it offers us more freedom to practice our religion than almost anywhere else,"" Shibly said. ""And whoever betrays that trust and that freedom that God offers us in this country and commits such horrific crimes against humanity will have to answer to God for his horrific crimes.""Other leaders in the community encouraged Muslims in the Orlando area to donate blood -- even though it is Ramadan, a holy month of fasting for Muslims. The Red Cross recommends drinking water and after before donating blood, but during Ramadan, Muslims are encouraged to refrain from both eating and drinking while the sun is out. Mahmoud ElAwadi, a financial advisor at Merrill Lynch, posted a photo to his Facebook page after donating blood at a bank in Orlando and called on other Muslims to donate. ""Our blood all look the same so get out there and donate blood cause our fellow American citizens are injured and need our blood,"" ElAwadi wrote on Facebook. ""Our community in central Florida is heart broken but let's put our colors, religions, ethnicity, sexual orientation, political views all aside so we can UNITE against those who are trying to hurt us."" Others responded with financial donations. Muslim Americans in Central Florida have been fundraising for the victims' families online. As of Tuesday afternoon, they've raised more than $60,000.Laila Abdelaziz, a staff member at CAIR Florida, told The Huffington Post that her community started the fundraise because it was ""the right thing to do.""""Our faith is our guidance to be the best human beings we can possibly be, and in a moment like this, our faith calls on us to support and mourn with the families of the victims, to act in whatever way we can to manifest the light and togetherness of community, rather than division and hate,"" she told HuffPost.While condemnation of the attack has been unequivocal across the board, some activists hoped that American Muslims would go one step further and speak out against interpretations of Islam that are opposed to same-sex relationships. Like the Bible, the Quran contains verses that condemn homosexuality. LGBT Muslims have reported that it is hard for them to find queer-friendly prayer spaces and mosques. Some report feeling marginalized and even invisible. Imam Daayiee Abdullah, a gay imam based in Washington, D.C., told The Daily Beast that some Muslims prefer to ""put their heads in the sand or be silent"" about LGBT issues. He hoped more Muslims worldwide will speak out against such interpretations of Islam. ""We need more Muslims worldwide to speak out to counter the hate so that those who harbor such horrible views realize their views are not consistent with our faith,"" Abdullah said. LGBT-friendly Muslim organizations do indeed exist and Muslim advocacy groups have been promoting an understanding of Islam that is inclusive of LGBT people. Queer Muslims have also been vocal in the aftermath of the attacks. One of these organizations is the Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity (MASGD). On Sunday, leaders within that community reiterated that the Orlando shooting can't be neatly categorized as a fight between the LGBTQ community and the Muslim community. ""As LGBTQ Muslims, we know that there are many of us who are living at the intersections of LGBTQ identities and Islam. At moments like this, we are doubly affected. We reject attempts to perpetuate hatred against our LGBTQ communities as well as our Muslim communities. We ask all Americans to resist the forces of division and hatred, and to stand against homophobia as well as against Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bigotry."" Wahajat Ali, a Muslim American writer, expressed hope online that his community would use this moment to uplift LGBT Muslims who ""often suffer in silence and have been ostracized and demonized by multiple communities in America for their sexuality, religion and ethnicity."" He encouraged Muslims to denounce anti-LGBT legislation that has been introduced in states across the country.""I believe this is a moment for us straight Muslims to aggressively and sincerely assert our solidarity with the LGBT community, not for sake of politics, talking points and expedient alliances, but around shared values and visions of creating an America where no one is hazed, victimized, brutalized or murdered simply for 'being,'"" Ali wrote on Facebook. ""Their struggle for freedoms and equality is our struggle and is the American struggle. Period."" This article has been updated to include comment from Laila Abdelaziz.

The Muslim community joins our fellow Americans in repudiating anyone or any group that would claim to justify or excuse such an appalling act of violence.”Hassan Shibly, chief executive director of CAIR-Florida, called for unity in a Facebook video, saying that it was important not to allow politicians to use this attack to ""promote fear, division and hate"" within America. ""America is one of the best places in the world to be a practicing Muslim -- to be Jewish, to be Christian, to be atheist, to be whoever you want to be, it offers us more freedom to practice our religion than almost anywhere else,"" Shibly said. ""And whoever betrays that trust and that freedom that God offers us in this country and commits such horrific crimes against humanity will have to answer to God for his horrific crimes.""Other leaders in the community encouraged Muslims in the Orlando area to donate blood -- even though it is Ramadan, a holy month of fasting for Muslims. The Red Cross recommends drinking water and after before donating blood, but during Ramadan, Muslims are encouraged to refrain from both eating and drinking while the sun is out. Mahmoud ElAwadi, a financial advisor at Merrill Lynch, posted a photo to his Facebook page after donating blood at a bank in Orlando and called on other Muslims to donate. ""Our blood all look the same so get out there and donate blood cause our fellow American citizens are injured and need our blood,"" ElAwadi wrote on Facebook. ""Our community in central Florida is heart broken but let's put our colors, religions, ethnicity, sexual orientation, political views all aside so we can UNITE against those who are trying to hurt us."" Others responded with financial donations. Muslim Americans in Central Florida have been fundraising for the victims' families online. As of Tuesday afternoon, they've raised more than $60,000.Laila Abdelaziz, a staff member at CAIR Florida, told The Huffington Post that her community started the fundraise because it was ""the right thing to do.""""Our faith is our guidance to be the best human beings we can possibly be, and in a moment like this, our faith calls on us to support and mourn with the families of the victims, to act in whatever way we can to manifest the light and togetherness of community, rather than division and hate,"" she told HuffPost.While condemnation of the attack has been unequivocal across the board, some activists hoped that American Muslims would go one step further and speak out against interpretations of Islam that are opposed to same-sex relationships. Like the Bible, the Quran contains verses that condemn homosexuality. LGBT Muslims have reported that it is hard for them to find queer-friendly prayer spaces and mosques. Some report feeling marginalized and even invisible. Imam Daayiee Abdullah, a gay imam based in Washington, D.C., told The Daily Beast that some Muslims prefer to ""put their heads in the sand or be silent"" about LGBT issues. He hoped more Muslims worldwide will speak out against such interpretations of Islam. ""We need more Muslims worldwide to speak out to counter the hate so that those who harbor such horrible views realize their views are not consistent with our faith,"" Abdullah said. LGBT-friendly Muslim organizations do indeed exist and Muslim advocacy groups have been promoting an understanding of Islam that is inclusive of LGBT people. Queer Muslims have also been vocal in the aftermath of the attacks. One of these organizations is the Muslim Alliance for Sexual and Gender Diversity (MASGD). On Sunday, leaders within that community reiterated that the Orlando shooting can't be neatly categorized as a fight between the LGBTQ community and the Muslim community. ""As LGBTQ Muslims, we know that there are many of us who are living at the intersections of LGBTQ identities and Islam. At moments like this, we are doubly affected. We reject attempts to perpetuate hatred against our LGBTQ communities as well as our Muslim communities. We ask all Americans to resist the forces of division and hatred, and to stand against homophobia as well as against Islamophobia and anti-Muslim bigotry."" Wahajat Ali, a Muslim American writer, expressed hope online that his community would use this moment to uplift LGBT Muslims who ""often suffer in silence and have been ostracized and demonized by multiple communities in America for their sexuality, religion and ethnicity."" He encouraged Muslims to denounce anti-LGBT legislation that has been introduced in states across the country.""I believe this is a moment for us straight Muslims to aggressively and sincerely assert our solidarity with the LGBT community, not for sake of politics, talking points and expedient alliances, but around shared values and visions of creating an America where no one is hazed, victimized, brutalized or murdered simply for 'being,'"" Ali wrote on Facebook. ""Their struggle for freedoms and equality is our struggle and is the American struggle. Period."" This article has been updated to include comment from Laila Abdelaziz.

47,BUSINESS,Walgreens Is Walking Out On Scandal-Struck Theranos,Alexander C. Kaufman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/theranos-walgreens-deal_us_575eb9c2e4b0ced23ca88de1,It's been a rough month for the blood testing startup so far.,2016-06-13,Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes plummeted earlier this month on Forbes' billionaire list. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575ec5cd2200002d00f809d2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Things just got much worse for Theranos.On Sunday, pharmacy giant Walgreens abandoned the embattled blood-testing startup accused of failing to deliver accurate results with its tests. The move came roughly nine months after The Wall Street Journal exposed major problems with the company's technology, which claimed to be able to run more than 240 blood tests using just a drop of blood. ""We have carefully considered our relationship with Theranos and believe it is in our customers' best interests to terminate our partnership,"" Brad Fluegel, Walgreens' senior vice president and chief health care commercial market development officer, said in a statement. The announcement strikes yet another major blow against Theranos, the 13-year-old startup that once boasted former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and George P. Schultz as board members.Nearly two weeks after the Journal published its exposé, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration said tiny vials Theranos used to collect patients' blood were not approved medical devices. In January, Walgreens suspended sending tests through Theranos' California laboratory, sparking a standoff between the two companies. According to a February report in the Financial Times, lawyers for Theranos believed there was ""little legal basis for terminating the partnership."" But the damage was already done. “They’ve been unhappy with the relationship and it’s really a question of working through the contractual and legal arrangements,” an unnamed person familiar with the matter told the FT of Walgreens' position. “They’re not interested in the Theranos deal.”In March, federal regulators proposed banning Theranos founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes from the blood testing industry for two years. ""Quality and safety are our top priorities and we are working closely with government officials to ensure that we not only comply with all federal regulations but exceed them,"" Brooke Buchanan, a Theranos spokeswoman, wrote in a statement on Sunday. ""We are disappointed that Walgreens has chosen to terminate our relationship and remain fully committed to our mission to provide patients access to affordable health information and look forward to continuing to serve customers in Arizona and California through our independent retail locations.""It's unclear how much the deal was worth.By backing out of the partnership, Walgreens puts Theranos' finances in further jeopardy. Two weeks ago, Forbes downgraded the company's value from $9 billion to $800 million. In doing so, the magazine -- whose lists evaluating the world's richest people and companies are considered the most definitive measure of wealth -- valued Holmes' net worth at about nothing. ""At such a low valuation, Holmes' stake is essentially worth nothing,"" reporter Matthew Herper wrote in a report announcing the reassessment. ""Theranos investors own preferred shares, which meanes they get paid back before Holmes, who owns common stock."" Holmes was previously valued at about $4.5 billion. "
48,POLITICS,Here's What Happened When A Terrorist Attacked LGBT People In A Country With Strict Gun Laws,Jessica Schulberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lgbt-israel-guns_us_575f0721e4b0e4fe5143407a,"There's no right to bear arms in Israel, and the death count in recent terror attacks is much lower than in terror-inspired U.S. mass murders.",2016-06-13,"In Israel, the soldiers are heavily armed, but civilians have to clear several tests before they can legally purchase a gun. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575f20091500002b0073a4a6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Like Florida shooter Omar Mateen, Yishai Schlissel was a homophobic extremist determined to kill gay people. But Schlissel, unlike Mateen, lived in a country with strict gun laws: Israel. When Schlissel attacked a gay pride parade in Jerusalem a year ago, he was armed with a knife, not an assault rifle.He stabbed six people, killing a 16-year-old girl before he was apprehended. Mateen used a semiautomatic assault-style rifle to shoot more than 100 people in a Florida gay nightclub early Sunday, killing 49, before law enforcement officers shot him to death.There is no such thing as a right to bear arms in Israel. To get a gun, an individual has to apply for a license, show a need for a firearm (either for work or personal safety), demonstrate an ability to safely use a gun, and pass a mental health check. Licenses are only granted to individuals who have been Israeli residents for more than three years and who are over 21 years of age if they served in the military, and 27 if they didn’t. Even after obtaining permission to buy a gun, the government limits the amount of ammunition an individual can purchase. In Israel, a country that faces frequent terror threats, proving a “need” for a gun isn’t automatic. During the Second Intifada, a violent Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s, author Daniel Gordis applied for a license to purchase a gun, citing his frequent travels to dangerous areas to report on violence. Gordis, now a senior vice president at Shalem College in Jerusalem, said the government rejected his application. “I thought it was a legitimate request and they turned me down,” Gordis said during a phone interview. “Obviously, I was momentarily annoyed that I got turned down -- but, actually, I took the larger view of it, and I thought, ‘Wow, that’s pretty amazing!’“Israel has a sense that there’s no right to a weapon,” Gordis explained. “A weapon is a responsibility, and it can be earned. Or you can have a need for a weapon -- but you don’t have a right to weapon.” Last year, the Israeli government encouraged individuals with firearms licenses to carry their weapons, and made it easier for people living in certain areas to legally carry a gun. The policy changes were tied to the wave of Palestinian attacks and drew criticism from Palestinian rights groups. But even with the changes, access to guns in Israel remains far more regulated than in the U.S.“The message is a bit mixed,” in Israel's relaxed gun restrictions, said Natan Sachs, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute who focuses on Israeli policies. Because of Israel's near-universal mandatory military service, guns are ubiquitous in the country, he said. “But there is still no perception in Israel that people, writ large, should just carry arms,” he added.In the U.S., owning firearms is considered an inherent right, regardless of need or the ability to safely use weapons. In a country with few restrictions on firearms purchases, Florida, in particular, has some of the least-restrictive regulations on gun ownership. The Sunshine State, which received an “F” last year on a scorecard compiled by Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, doesn't restrict the sale of assault weapons, limit the number of guns that can be purchased at one time, or require background checks for private sales, including sales at gun shows. Guns & Ammo magazine ranked Florida as the 12th-best state to own a gun, describing the state’s laws as the “envy of gun owners nationwide.”Mateen, who was once on an FBI watchlist for possible ties to terrorism, legally purchased a semiautomatic assault-style rifle capable of spraying bullets as fast as the shooter can pull the trigger. Asked if an Israeli civilian could get access to the type of assault weapon used by Mateen -- and by numerous other U.S. mass murderers -- Gordis was emphatic. “Never, never, never, never, never, never, zero,” he said. “People are walking around with pistols. … The only people walking around with real serious guns are soldiers.”When terrorists in Israel get guns, they don't always work. Last week, two Palestinian gunmen opened fire on civilians in Tel Aviv. But they were using cheap imitations of a Swedish World War II-era rifle. Video footage of the attack shows one gun appearing to jam and an ammunition clip falling out of the second. The two terrorists killed four people in the attack. Part of the reason for Israel’s strict regulation of civilian gun ownership is that the country has a security-driven interest in making sure weapons don’t flow into the hands of terrorists. “There is a very tight monitoring of where all the weapons are,” Sachs said. “The last thing you want, especially in a place like Israel, is to have arms roaming free.” "

He even expanded the idea to include potential visitors from any nation or place that he (as president) would deem a threat.He insinuated that both President Barack Obama and presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton were ignorant, weak-willed or complicit – or all three – in what he termed a total breakdown of U.S. immigration security.And like an orange-haired knight of the 12th century, he in effect vowed to lead a crusade -- not to capture Old Jerusalem from the infidels, but to protect a New Jerusalem (America) from being overrun by what he repeatedly (at least 18 times) called “radical Islam” or “Islamic terrorists.”It was surely the most virulent attack on another culture and faith in American politics in decades. And it echoed vitriol of past centuries unleashed against Catholics, Jews, African-Americans and others once deemed to be outsiders.Now many may hope that Trump’s screed – delivered in Manchester, New Hampshire, at Saint Anselm College, an institution named in honor of a paragon of Christian rationalism – was a wild shot that landed harmlessly in the New England woods.It was anything but. With the sure touch of a safecracker, Trump on Monday sought to bring forth the deep insecurities of an American electorate that is not only frightened about terrorism but more generally alarmed that the America they thought they knew is disappearing in the latest waves of immigration, networks of new technologies, and the rising power of distant cultures.Trump, who burst onto the political stage a few years ago insinuating that Obama was a foreign-born Muslim agent, has now expanded that charge to include 1.6 billion Muslims around the world and other people from other places he deems dangerous. Chinese businessmen, Mexican drug dealers, NATO bureaucrats – they are all threats, but the leading edge of fear is Muslim immigration in Trump’s worldview.It is a view shared by more voters than perhaps Democrats and media elites appreciate. A poll in March showed that half of all voters agreed with Trump’s call for a “temporary” ban on Muslim immigration to the U.S.After Orlando, that number is sure to grow – especially if Trump has anything to do with it.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.How to help the Orlando shooting victims:"

""We think that is the right course of action.""The Iraqi army launched the offensive on Fallujah on May 23, with air support from the U.S.-led coalition.
