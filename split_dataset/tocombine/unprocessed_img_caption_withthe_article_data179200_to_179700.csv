0,PARENTING,Why We Need More Doctors Online,"Claire McCarthy, M.D., Contributor
Pediatrician at Boston Children's Hospital, Assistant Professo...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/doctors-online_us_5b9c323ae4b03a1dcc7d038b,"If we really care about the health decisions our patients make, we need to do everything we can to be sure that they find good information -- which means getting online ourselves.",2012-08-28,2012-08-28-scNow_Top10Badge_Pediatrics_300x250.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-08-28-scNow_Top10Badge_Pediatrics_300x250.png,"I got a really unexpected honor last week: according to Sharecare, I'm the top online influencer for children's health.I truly didn't see it coming. I didn't go into the online space to be an influencer. I've been writing about health and parenting for more than twenty years; when publishing moved into the online space, I just moved along with it. But having been online, blogging and doing other social media, it has become increasingly clear to me that I need to be there -- and that more doctors need to be there with me.The main reason? Because that's where the patients are. According to Pew Internet, eight out of ten people with internet access look up health information online. I'm seeing it more and more in my patients; ""I looked it up online, and..."" is something I hear all the time now. People don't wait for an appointment, or even for their doctor to call them back -- they Google their symptoms and very often make health decisions based on what they find. If we really care about the health decisions our patients make, we need to do everything we can to be sure that they find good information -- which means getting online ourselves.We need more doctors and other health professionals writing good content, but getting online doesn't necessarily mean writing. It could mean finding good websites and sharing them. It could mean commenting when we see something that we agree with -- or don't. It could mean engaging in one of the many conversations going on in social media about health.It seems like most of the conversation about doctors being online involves concern about ethics and professionalism. I admit that I've seen some stuff on Facebook and Twitter that has made me cringe, and clearly it's not a good idea to give specific medical advice online (nothing can replace a good history and physical examination). But this is all manageable.Dr. Katherine Chretien did a study of tweets sent by doctors and found that only 3% might be considered unprofessional, and less than one percent had any private patient information. Overall, these are small numbers. As my doctor-blogger colleague Wendy Sue Swanson says, we are way worse on elevators than we are online. It's easy enough to come up with guidelines and education to help doctors navigate the online space ethically, professionally and safely. Another doctor-blogger friend of mine, Bryan Vartabedian, who writes a great blog called 33 Charts, has some really good ideas about this, including a recent post about how he handles online questions from patients.The thing is, we can't let these concerns stop us from getting online -- because people who are not medical professionals are there and doing a better job of giving bad information than we are of giving good information.There is also tremendous opportunity in the online space. There is so much that we doctors are supposed to be doing and saying and teaching people in our always-too-brief appointments; what if we sent them to good websites (or content we create ourselves) for generic health information and spent those precious minutes the way each patient needs us to? Obviously we can't do this for everyone, but if we could do it for even a few, it could make a real difference.The Internet brings tremendous opportunities for connecting with and learning from our patients and their families. The Internet is changing how we think about health; it has empowered people to look for different kinds of answers and to share their experiences with others. As doctors, we have so much to bring to the conversation -- and so much to gain.So, here's my message to my profession: Let's not get left behind. Let's find ways to support health care professionals in giving patients what they want and need online -- and in doing it well. Let's think of the Internet as an extension of the exam room space -- and a tool to help people lead healthier, better lives.And my message to patients and families: be patient with us doctors. We'll get online with you sooner or later (maybe you could encourage your doctor to do so!). In the meantime, remember to check in with us about what you find when you go there. We want to make sure that you are making the best health decisions possible-after all, that's our job."

Holmes appears in Arapahoe County District Court in Centennial, Colo. Holmes is accused of killing 12 people and wounding 58 in the attack during a midnight showing of the new Batman movie. His attorneys say that he is mentally ill. Letters, his resume and a personal statement written by Holmes paint a picture a bright student who is committed to pursuing a career as cognitive neuroscientist. (AP Photo/Denver Post, RJ Sangosti, Pool, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c328f2200003000d925e0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"James Holmes, the 24-year-old former neuroscience graduate student who's been charged in the gruesome movie theater shooting in Aurora, Colo., last month, had asked a fellow graduate student about a mental condition called dysphoric mania weeks before the shooting, the New York Times reported. According to the Times report:She messaged back, asking him if dysphoric mania could be managed with treatment. Mr. Holmes replied: ""It was,"" but added that she should stay away from him ""because I am bad news."" It was the last she heard from him.The detailed Times report did not say whether this condition is something that Holmes had officially been diagnosed with, or what kinds of treatment he was receiving for this condition if he did, indeed, have it.But Dr. Alan C. Swann, who has conducted research on the condition, told HuffPost that dysphoric mania -- also known as mixed mania -- can be harder to treat and diagnose than if someone experiences the more well-known symptoms of bipolar disorder. Most people know that bipolar disorder involves mood swings from depression to mania. But ""it's not always that well compartmentalized, not for everybody,"" explains Swann, who is the director of research at the University of Texas Harris County Psychiatric Center and professor and vice-chairman of research of the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. With dysphoric mania, a person may be in a manic phase, but that mania is tinged with dark, negative emotions, explains Swann, who is not involved in Holmes' treatment. A person can feel depressed and hopeless, but they can be activated and have energy at the same time. This could also put them at a higher risk for self harm and suicide, he says.According to a 2000 study in the journal Comprehensive Psychiatry that examined the characteristics of mixed mania compared with depression and mania, Italian researchers said that ""patients with depression more frequently reported a history of suicidality than those with mania, whereas they did not significantly differ from patients with mixed mania."" However, ""it's not like people should be afraid of people in mixed states,"" Swann tells HuffPost. ""It's a severe form of illness. It just means they have a more severe illness to overcome."" If a doctor knows to look out for this mixed state of mania and depression, it's not difficult to diagnose dysphoric mania. But the tricky part is exactly that -- knowing to look for these combined symptoms. ""The problem is it goes against what you learn in school. When someone is depressed, they [the doctors] have to look for some subtle sides of the opposite,"" Swann says. ""If someone's manic, you have to look for the opposite of mania -- helpless, anxious, worried … It can be hard to see.""Right now, mixed mania is listed under bipolar disorder in the current Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). However, in the upcoming DSM-V, there is a proposed revision to define bipolar disorder with mixed features as either being ""predominantly manic or hypomanic,"" coupled with three symptoms of depression (like fatigue, feelings of worthlessness, etc.) or as being ""predominantly depressed,"" coupled with three symptoms of mania (like elevated mood, extreme talkativeness, more energy, etc.). WebMD reported that mixed episodes of depression and mania affect anywhere from 20 to 70 percent of people with bipolar disorder. It's more difficult to treat with antipsychotic or mood-stabilizing medications -- ""it generally takes more time and medicine to get well,"" Swann says -- since certain mood-stabilizing drugs like lithium that are typically used for bipolar may not work quite as well for dysphoric mania. And if a doctor doesn't catch the signs of mania and only treats the signs of depression with antidepressants, it could actually exacerbate the mania, Swann says, as ""antidepressants often backfire in bipolar disorder because they can make someone who's depressed and activate them.""

5,TRAVEL,American Community In Mexico Disappointed By American Drug Policies,Andrew Burmon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mexico-drug-war-american-community_us_5b9c31b4e4b03a1dcc7cfecb,"American retirees and tourists had historically flooded into the lakeside communities of Chapala and Ajijic, which boast",2012-08-28,"Description Lake Chapala, Jalisco | Source http://www. ... com/people/31235830@N00 Francisco Javier Espinoza Pￃﾩrez from Obregon, Mexico | ... ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c31b43c00005b0009ab3f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This post is part of the HuffPost Shadow Conventions 2012, a series spotlighting three issues that are not being discussed at the national GOP and Democratic conventions: The Drug War, Poverty in America, and Money in Politics.Michael Haskett has been busier since Mexican police discovered two vans full of dismembered bodies sitting near Lake Chapala in May. According to Haskett, who runs the Vida Alarms safety and emergency response service, that horrific discovery frightened many of the American expats living nearby, who had long worried about the incursion of narco-violence on their sunny idyll.""Some of them were just deciding that they'd thought about this for a long time and there was finally catalyst,"" says Haskett. ""Some of them were afraid to see their own shadow.""American retirees and tourists had historically flooded into the lakeside communities of Chapala and Ajijic, which boast affordable housing and excellent medical services, as well as perpetual spring temperatures, but locals say that flow has begun to slow. Though these idyllic communities -- all colorful main streets and aging monasteries -- sit well away from the drug corridor, Jalisco's expats are beginning to feel the effects of U.S. drug and gun policies.Prior to the gory discovery at the lake, violence in the Guadalajara exurbs had been rare and random. Haskett, who believes the threat is little different than in other communities north of the border, says he'd previously seen demand in his product increase following a handful of incidents: A shootout in Chapala left three gunmen dead and two bystanders injured, a Chapalan woman and her German husband were killed during the course of a robbery, an Ajijic man was shot outside his home. Over this past weekend, a Jalisco-based cartel blocked off highways near Chapala, presenting locals with evidence of escalation.Still, a constellation of road blocks is a far cry from the horrors being reported in Ciudad Juarez, where the cartels left dozens of bodies in the streets and intimidated locals with decapitations. While the U.S. government contributed to former Mexican President Felipe Calderon's cartel crackdown -- the State Department claims to have provided $1.6 billion in assistance through the Merida Initiative since 2008 -- American drug consumption contributed to the cartels. In a 2009 speech in Monterrey, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton estimated that U.S. citizens purchased roughly $25 billion in illicit drugs annually. That money is part of what bothers Chapala locals, because it means that narco-trafficking is a growth business.Sid Grosvenor, a real estate agent who runs the Chapala Club community website, compares the current explosion of crime in Mexico to the growth of gangs during Prohibition. Rather than seeing the cartel problem as endemic, Grosvenor laments Mexico's geographic misfortune in sharing a border with ""the largest drug consuming country in the world."" ""Many [expats] think that the U.S. should legalize marijuana, which accounts for a large percentage of the profits of the cartels, tax it with revenues going to aid law enforcement along the border,"" says Grosvenor, who has programmed his cell phone so he can call police patrol cars whenever he sees something suspicious.Ken Smith, a local originally from California, says that some Americans and Canadians are packing up and heading north because they feel unsafe. He claims to have also ""heard many accounts of gringos who have cancelled plans to move here."" For his part, Smith says he feels safe even though he's met young men who have later been abducted and witnessed a shootout near his home. ""What has not yet returned to normal [since the discovery of the corpse-filled vans] is business,"" says Smith. ""There is much talk about foreigners drastically reducing the asking price of their homes, which are then purchased by middle and upper class Mexicans from Guadalajara and Mexico City.""Smith says he doesn't expect the situation to improve.""U.S. drug policy is a direct cause of the violence in Mexico,"" says Smith. ""It is irritating that most Americans think that corruption and bribery are only on the south side of the border.""According to Richard Kiy, President and CEO of the International Community Foundation, which works with Mexican charities and monitors cross-border relations, both Smith's jaundiced attitude toward U.S. policies and his cavalier attitude toward the risk posed by drug-related violence are representative of expat communities around Mexico. A 2011 poll showed that while narco-violence did not affect the frequency or duration of 94.5 percent of expats' stays in Mexico, 64.2 percent of expats credited the clashes with decreasing the number of visits from family members and friends, thanks to a February travel warning. Kiy blames the fears of infrequent visitors on sensationalism and the American tendency to ""consume our news in sound bites and headlines,"" but admits that the rise of cartels has changed the way Americans view Mexico and Mexicans view America.""Drug-related violence has fundamentally changed the perception that many Americans have of Mexico,"" says Kiy. ""Many Americans that once frequented Mexico are now too frightened to cross the border. On the other hand, many Mexicans feel that America is not doing enough to curb the country's demand for illicit drugs. Furthermore, many Mexicans remain frustrated by the free-flow of arms coming across from United States into Mexico, which has a strict ban on the importation of fire arms.""Though the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives's ""Fast and Furious"" program was designed to help stop the flow of guns into Mexico, it resulted mostly in scandal. Guns continued to cross the border.The guns Chapala's expats fear may be held by Mexicans, but they are purchased in the U.S. with American money.For now, Chapala remains paradisiacal and fairly safe. Expats and locals mix, mingle and work together to bring in foreign tourists -- Mexico has offset the decline of American tourism by attracting other nationalities. But a different future, a worse future, is now imaginable.Bodies are easier to bury than fear.HuffPost Live will be taking a comprehensive look at America’s failed war on drugs August 28th and September 4th from 12-4 pm ET and 6-10 pm ET.

Romney, were patriarchs of adjoining Mormon communities back in the mid-19th century. Miles P. Romney, it turns out, was indebted to Freeman's ancestor, and now Freeman's taken her argument for repayment to the public.The story begins when federal marshalls targeted the prominent Mormons, eventually arresting both under strict anti-polygamy laws. Romney skated on the co-habitation charge by sending two of his three wives into hiding, but another charge -- relating to land dispute claims -- stuck. ""Now we come to the matter I’d like to bring up with Mitt,"" Freeman writes in the ""Los Angeles Review of Books.""Flake had more money than Romney and ended up posting bail -- set at $1,000 each -- for both men. But Romney allegedly skipped town and fled to Mexico with his wives and their children. ""He left my great-grandfather Flake holding the bag,"" Freeman writes.Now, about 130 years later, the author estimates the debt to be worth about $25,000. (She's willing to let the interest on the bill slide.) ""It's never too late to make a situation right, and since Mitt Romney seems to have sufficient funds now to cover his ancestor's old debt, I'd like to call upon him to do so,"" Freeman writes.The presidential candidate's fortune is hard to pin down, with his assets generally thought to be worth anywhere between $85 million and $264 million, according to CNN. Either way, the former Massachusetts governor can probably afford the bill. After all, the Romneys declared a loss of $77,000 on their 2010 tax returns for their share in the care and feeding of their top dressage horse, Rafalca, according to The New York Times.If Romney does decide to honor his ancestor's bond loan, Freeman said he can be assured the money will be distributed fairly and equally among William Jordan Flake's approximately 15,000 living descendants.This is not the first time details of the Romney family saga have come to light. The prominent Mormon's family history has been examined carefully during his many years in public office, and in January a new biography titled ""The Real Romney"" was released by publishing house HarperCollins. Written by a pair of veteran Boston Globe reporters, the investigative book included several details of Miles P. Romney's life. However, according to this account, the elder Romney had five wives, more than 30 children and was ordered to flee to Mexico by church officials, the Washington Post notes."
