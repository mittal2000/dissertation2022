The program has struggled under a deluge of unprocessed cases.Still, the number of commutations Obama has given is more than double the previous six presidents combined, the White House said.Obama has now commuted the sentences of a total of 306 people, including 110 who had been serving life terms.Among those named on Thursday, were Jasmine Allen of Florida, who had been convicted of conspiracy to distribute a small amount of cocaine base, Wade Cutchen of Virginia, serving a sentence for possession and intent to distribute heroin and cocaine, and Tomma Jean Kent, of Iowa, who had been convicted of conspiracy to distribute methamphetamine(Reporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by Peter Cooney and Alistair Bell)"

Last year, a Kansas judge blocked a law signed by Governor Sam Brownback, a Republican, that would have banned a common second trimester abortion procedure.The Kansas Department of Health and Environment plans to cut Planned Parenthood off from state Medicaid funds beginning next Tuesday, according to court documents.Planned Parenthood filed its lawsuit against Kansas on Wednesday, arguing the state will break federal law and violate the U.S. Constitution when it follows Brownback's order to cut funding, the court records showed.""This action challenges the unlawful, unwarranted and politically motivated decision,"" the suit said.Brownback, a Republican, has said he would ensure that no taxpayer money would go to Planned Parenthood.By cutting funds to the organization, he wanted ""to protect the unborn and support a culture of life in Kansas,"" said Eileen Hawley, the governor's spokeswoman, in an email to the Wichita Eagle newspaper published on Wednesday.In April, federal Medicaid Director Vikki Wachino sent the letter to Medicaid agencies in all 50 U.S. states, warning them against cutting off funds to Planned Parenthood.Wachino's letter did not name Planned Parenthood directly, but said state Medicaid funds for healthcare providers may only be restricted if the provider cannot perform covered medical services or bill for services appropriately."
2,POLITICS,Chicago’s Top Prosecutor Will Not Try The Officer Who Killed Laquan McDonald,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anita-alvarez-recuse-laquan-mcdonald_us_572b8913e4b0bc9cb046004d,#ByeAnita,2016-05-05,Cook County State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez was criticized for her close ties to the Chicago police union. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572b895f160000580431dd5f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Cook County State’s Attorney Anita Alvarez announced on Thursday that she will recuse herself from prosecuting the case against Jason Van Dyke, the Chicago Police officer accused of murdering 17-year-old Laquan McDonald in 2014. Alvarez has asked that a special prosecutor be appointed. The move is a reversal for Alvarez, who had previously said a special prosecutor was unnecessary. ""While it has not been an easy decision, I believe that it is the right one because it will help to avoid unnecessary legal delays and provide continuity in the handling of this very important and complicated case,"" said a statement from Alvarez’s office. ""It would also ensure that one designated prosecutor will handle this case as it proceeds to trial.""Alvarez has been heavily criticized for the way her office handled McDonald’s death. In October 2014, Van Dyke shot McDonald 16 times as the teen walked away from police. Alvarez’s office received the dashcam footage of the shooting two weeks after the incident. But Van Dyke wasn’t charged with first-degree murder until November, when video of the shooting was made public via a court order. Following the video’s release, large-scale protests were held throughout the city. Activists made “16 shots and a cover up” a battle cry, demanding Alvarez’s resignation. The #ByeAnita campaign used social media to inform voters of Alvarez’s professional history. In March, Alvarez, who has a record of being harsh on juvenile offenders and lenient on police misconduct, lost her shot at re-election to challenger Kim Foxx in Chicago’s Democratic primary. Alvarez cited the recent election as a reason for her recusal on Thursday. ""While there is no legal conflict of interest that would prevent the state's attorney's office from continuing the prosecution of this case, I believe that the results of the recent election and the impending transition of this office make this the best and most responsible decision,” the statement from her office said.In February, several organizations filed a legal petition in criminal court claiming that Alvarez’s close relationship with Chicago’s police union was a conflict of interest. The close political allegiance, the petition said, would prevent her from “zealously and effectively” prosecuting Van Dyke. The petition was signed by the Cook County Bar Association, the Chicago Urban League and Reps. Danny K. Davis (D-Ill.) and Bobby Rush (D-Ill.). Alvarez’s recusal still needs to be approved by the presiding judge, who will address the issue in court on June 2."

The auto giant invested $500 million in Lyft earlier this year with the clear intent of developing driverless technology.A source close to Lyft, who declined to be identified because they were not authorized to speak for the company, emphasized to The Huffington Post that the program is at a theoretical stage, rather than an imminent reality, at this time. While Lyft has long been an advocate for driverless technology, a fleet of self-driving taxis will be tested at GM's headquarters long before they hit public streets.A Lyft executive told the Journal the fleet will likely be comprised of Chevrolet Bolts powered by technology developed by Cruise Automation, which Chevrolet parent company GM acquired in March. Other specifics of the program -- including its location -- are far from certain. But the Journal reports that once it's running, customers will be allowed to opt out should they prefer to have a human driver at the wheel.GM did not immediately respond to a request for comment, but has previously hailed Cruise Automation's technology as ""unmatched"" in the auto industry, presenting it as a significant advantage over competitors like Google, Tesla and Lyft rival Uber, who are rushing to develop their own driverless car tech. Uber declined to comment. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, a nonpartisan research group that tracks legislation, California, Florida, Michigan, Nevada, North Dakota, Tennessee and Washington, D.C., have passed laws to some degree permitting self-driving vehicles on their streets.For the time being, that means Lyft's self-driving taxis will likely be limited to a city in one of the six states, or possibly the District of Columbia, as autonomous vehicles can't legally operate on public roads elsewhere.David Strickland, the former chief of the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the agency that oversees regulations for self-driving cars, told Reuters last week that the government must establish guidelines for automakers before the technology can be used broadly.Indeed, as a fender-bender involving a self-driving Google car in California recently highlighted, the technology -- while arguably safer than human drivers -- isn't exactly flawless.In 2014, 6.1 million crashes on U.S. roads killed 32,675 people and injured 2.3 million more, Reuters reports. NHTSA says about 94 percent of all traffic crashes are caused by human error.""What people are looking for is clear rules of the road of what needs to be done for [fully autonomous] vehicles to be on the road,"" Strickland said. ""Nobody wants to take a shortcut on this.""The NHTSA plans to release something to that effect sometime this July.Note: The Huffington Post's Editor-in-Chief Arianna Huffington is a member of the board of directors for Uber, one of Lyft's competitors, and has recused herself from any involvement related to the site's coverage of that company."
4,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: Donald Trump’s Nomination Isn’t Shocking According To The Polls,"Natalie Jackson, Ariel Edwards-Levy, and Janie Velencia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-nomination-polls_us_572b3a3be4b0bc9cb045c503,Trump led the pack for nearly a year. Why are we surprised he won?,2016-05-05,Sharp rise in support for increased defense spending,http://www.people-press.org/files/2016/05/PP_16.05.01_sharpRise_310px.png,"There was a lot of ink spilled on doubting primary polls -- some of it justified, but some probably due to Trump disbelief. State general election polls show Clinton leading over Trump, although some of the margins are small. And support for increased defense spending has reached its highest levels in over a decade. This is HuffPollster for Thursday, May 5, 2016.A TRUMP NOMINATION SHOULDN’T BE A SURPRISE BASED ON POLLS - With Donald Trump the last man standing in the Republican nomination race, a retrospective look at polls from the last year results in one major conclusion: Trump was a stronger candidate than anyone wanted to admit. He skyrocketed to the top of an incredibly crowded pack soon after announcing he was running. Every time there seemed to be a ceiling for his support, he cracked it and broke through. Countless articles (including from HuffPollster) reminded us that primary polls weren't predictive, they could be wrong and that Trump’s numbers were driven by his celebrity and name recognition. Turns out celebrity status and name recognition don’t go away when people are voting. With the exception of Iowa, time and time again the Republican primary polls were right. Early primary polls aren’t always predictive of outcomes -- in 2008, Hillary Clinton, after leading solidly for more than a year, saw Barack Obama soar past her once voting started. But in this case, they were. Trump’s lead was actually much more stable than Romney’s in 2012 - Trump’s lead was remarkably consistent in the national primary polls. Unlike 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, who lost his lead four times to four different candidates, including once after voting started in early 2012, Trump never faced substantive opposition. He was buoyed by an overwhelming advantage in airtime and the party establishment's inability to coalesce around one of his rivals. Trump succeeded despite his low favorable ratings and slower-than-usual delegate accumulation. But the polling consistency for Trump raises the question: Was the intense polling criticism in late 2015 as much about Trump’s lead as it was about the polls themselves? It’s easy to see how disbelief that Trump was leading, and strong dislike for Trump’s politics, could have colored polling coverage this year. A lesson: The seemingly impossible can happen - Nate Cohn, discussing why pundits missed on Trump: “We were just overconfident. There haven’t been very many presidential elections in the modern era of primaries. There certainly haven’t been enough to rule out the possibility that a true outsider could win the nomination, even if it seemed very incongruent with what had happened in the post-reform era. That’s a lesson to keep in mind heading into the general election.” [NYTimes] A LOOK AT STATE-LEVEL GENERAL ELECTION POLLING - Although the general election is just getting underway, pollsters have been asking about hypothetical state match-ups for months. As it stands, Hillary Clinton leads Trump in each of the 10 states where HuffPost Pollster has enough data to calculate an average,  by margins ranging from 2 to 21 points. Things will change in the next six months, but an early assessment gives Clinton the advantage. Early state-level handicapping also favors Clinton - An early state forecast by election handicapper Charlie Cook estimates that 304 electoral votes will go to the Democratic nominee, and 190 will go to the Republican nominee; 44 votes are rated as a toss-up. Notably, Colorado, Florida, and Virginia, all of which were tossup states in 2012, are in the “lean Democrat” column. [Cook Political Report]Prediction markets: Trump has a 30 percent chance of winning - David Rothschild: ""Trump is trailing models of where the generic Republican should be at the start of the election. He is going to start out at about 30 percent likelihood to win the election. The generic Republican versus the generic Democrat should be have about a 47 percent chance (or you could say Clinton is going to start out at about a 70 percent chance to win the election where the generic Democrat versus the generic Republican should be about 53 percent). Of course, Trump is not the generic Republican and Clinton is not the generic Democrat. The 70 percent/30 percent data comes from aggregating prediction market data. This time in 2008 and 2012 the Democratic nominee’s chances were about 60 percent, so 70 percent is a pretty strong opening number. But, it is certainly not insurmountable. The reason is pretty simple, there just are not that many swing states and Trump could, probably will not, but could win them."" [HuffPost] SUPPORT FOR DEFENSE SPENDING REACHES HIGHEST LEVEL SINCE POST 9-11 - Pew Research: ""With the United States facing an array of global threats, public support for increased defense spending has climbed to its highest level since a month after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when 50% favored more defense spending. Currently, 35% say the U.S. should increase spending on national defense, 24% say it should be cut back and 40% say it should be kept about the same as today. The share favoring more defense spending has increased 12 percentage points (from 23%) since 2013. Most of the increase has come among Republicans. Fully 61% of Republicans favor higher defense spending, up 24 percentage points from 2013. Support for more defense spending has increased much more modestly among other partisan groups. And the gap in support for higher military spending between Republicans and Democrats, which was 25 percentage points three years ago, now stands at 41 points."" [Pew]MOST TRUMP SUPPORTERS BELIEVE IN CLIMATE CHANGE - Mollie Reilly: ""[Fifty-six] percent of people supporting Trump in the 2016 race think global warming is real. Among John Kasich voters, that percentage jumps to 71, while only 36 percent of Ted Cruz’s supporters believe in man-made climate change. (Kasich and Cruz both left the presidential race after Indiana’s primary.) Trump voters were also more likely to back a presidential candidate if he or she strongly supported addressing global warming. Meanwhile, nearly all Democratic voters — 93 percent of Bernie Sanders backers and 92 percent of Hillary Clinton supporters — believe in global warming. But while most Trump voters acknowledge that climate change is happening, just 35 percent said they were worried about it. In contrast, 83 percent of Clinton supporters and 80 percent of Sanders supporters are concerned by current warming trends.""

Their makers had lobbied for their more expensive, typically hand-rolled products to be excluded from such oversight.The FDA said in a statement that the regulations will bring all these products in line with how it oversees other tobacco products such as cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and roll-your-own tobacco.E-cigarettes are handheld electronic devices that vaporize a fluid typically including nicotine and a flavor component. Using them is called ""vaping.""In 2009, the FDA began focusing on e-cigarettes as the product began appearing in the U.S. market. That year, President Barack Obama signed the Family Control Act, a law that gave the agency authority over cigarettes, smokeless and roll-your-own tobacco products. Congress also gave authority to the agency to assert jurisdiction over other tobacco products.The FDA is trying to limit teen use, which has been soaring, by prohibiting sales to those under 18 and the distribution of free samples. But the agency does not directly limit flavors in e-cigarettes, which vary from bacon to bubble gum and have been popular with teens.The use of e-cigarettes is on the rise among U.S. middle and high school students, according to government figures, and officials said they are now the most commonly used tobacco product among youth.Data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the FDA's Center for Tobacco Products released in April showed that 3 million middle and high school students reported using e-cigarettes in 2015, compared with 2.46 million in 2014.The FDA established a staggered review period for products introduced after Feb. 15, 2007, of between 12 and 24 months. The FDA had proposed a two-year grace period.(Reporting by Caroline Humer and Jilian Mincer in New York and Toni Clarke in Washington; Editing by Will Dunham)"

Her 17-year-old son, Jordan Davis, was gunned down by a 47-year-old white man at a Florida gas station in 2012 over playing loud music.This year will mark the fourth Mother's Day McBath will have to spend without her son. And McBath isn't alone. The mothers of Tamir Rice, Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Sandra Bland, Michael Brown, Trayvon Martin and so many others will most likely reminisce over their lost child on Sunday. While tough, this can also be a moment of strength for moms, said McBath. She shared some poignant advice with The Huffington Post about how these moms can practice some much needed self-care this Mother's Day. ""First and foremost, you've got to lean on God,"" she told HuffPost. ""He's always there for you no matter what, and he can fill the pain that you feel on Mother's Day. And also, just surround yourself with family and friends. Do something that you enjoy doing. Do something that edifies you, edifies your spirit and your soul.""McBath, who was honored at VH1's ""Dear Mama"" ceremony which will air on Sunday, has spoken out against gun violence and used her activism to honor her son and fight for other moms whose children have been gunned down.""When our children are being gunned down in the street and our loved ones are being gunned down in the street, then we have a responsibility as mothers to really speak up against what we see happening,"" she said. ""We're the givers of life. And we also need to be willing to preserve that life that we've given.""Along with fighting on behalf of their children, McBath wants mothers to find solace by remembering their child's legacy. She said one lesson her son taught her was to ""walk out the very thing that I was trying to teach him."" Reminiscing on that lesson is one way, she said, she'll honor her son this Sunday.""Know that no matter what, even though physically your loved one is not there, that, still, in spirit they're with you and that you carry on their life,"" McBath said. And just revel in that for the day and know that you're still loved and still cared for and no matter what, you're still a mother.""Watch a clip of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton honoring McBath from VH1's ""Dear Mama"" special, airing Sunday at 9 p.m. EST, below."

The nearly two-minute-long video -- entitled “Why is Google sponsoring hate?” -- features an image of the Google homepage as someone searches racist tactics used by Donald Trump, such as “scapegoating immigrants” and “anti-Muslim hysteria.” It then cuts to footage of Trump employing the inflammatory tactic shown on screen, including his infamous remarks calling Mexican immigrants “rapists” and “criminals,” and his announcement of a proposed ban on Muslims entering the United States.""It isn't too late for Google to do the right thing,"" the video concludes in text on the screen. ""Tell Google: Don't sponsor hate. #DumpTrump.""CREDO blasted the video to 360,000 of its members in an email. A subset of emails sent to several thousand members every day for several weeks will include a request that they call Google senior employees to ask them to withdraw from the agreement to provide the live stream. (CREDO confirmed that it has the office phone numbers of dozens of Google staff members.)CREDO has also purchased Facebook ads featuring the video that are targeted at some 10,000 Google employees in the San Francisco Bay and Washington, D.C., areas.CREDO Action’s Heidi Hess, who is leading the new campaign to pressure Google, said that in the event that Trump begins to tone down his rhetoric as part of a general election strategy, the organization does not want corporations to excuse their ties to a Trump-led Republican party by claiming he never meant what he said.“The goal of the video is to make really clear to Google and to other corporations that are still considering whether or not to support the Republican National Convention, that when they support the convention, they are buying Trump’s platform along with the political access they are trying to buy,” Hess said.UltraViolet Action, an online women’s rights group, is taking a more tongue-in-cheek approach to pressuring the tech giant. The group announced on Monday that it was debuting a “Big Wig. Tiny Hands.” extension for Google Chrome. The extension, available for download at tinyhands.io, allows users to attach an image of Donald Trump’s hair to the Google logo on Google’s search engine homepage.Riva Litman, a Google spokeswoman, said Google’s goal in providing the live stream is to make the convention “accessible to millions of people (via YouTube) that can't be there in person.”Litman denied that the sponsorship represented any kind of an endorsement of Trump’s views, and noted that Google provided the same service for the conventions of both major parties in 2012. “This is a completely neutral, nonpartisan role -- and we aren't endorsing either party or candidate,” Litman said. “We're just there to provide access, information, and data.”The company has not yet announced plans to provide the live stream for the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia, which will take place later in July after the GOP convention.But CREDO Action rejects the notion of neutrality in a convention headlined by a hate-monger like Trump.“One of the major political parties has chosen to nominate a bigot,” Heidi Hess said. “It is not politics as usual. It is a real time for these companies to make a choice and decide what side of history they want to be on.”The progressive groups' new initiatives follow a petition campaign started by Color of Change and joined by CREDO Action, UltraViolet Action and other groups demanding that Google, Coca-Cola, Xerox, AT&T, Adobe Systems, Cisco and other companies cancel their plans to sponsor a “Donald Trump-led” Republican national convention in Cleveland this July.Activists from the organizations delivered more than 500,000 petition signatures to Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, last Thursday. As part of their action, a plane holding a banner with the message, “Google: Don’t be evil. #DumpTrump,” flew over Google headquarters and the San Francisco Bay. Notwithstanding the colorful protest and volume of petition signatures, Google announced that it had finalized its plans to provide the official live stream, and other associated services, for the convention.There are indications that other companies may be more responsive to the pressure, however. The New York Times reported on March 30 that Coca-Cola decided to donate $75,000 to the Republican national convention this year, down from its $660,000 donation to the GOP gathering in 2012. The company did not specify to the Times the reasons behind its decision, but the paper noted the Atlanta-based company’s investment in promoting its brand to communities of color. Color of Change’s version of the petition also featured Coca-Cola more prominently than any other corporation.One reason Google’s backing for the Republican National Convention has become a focal point of CREDO Action and UltraViolet Action’s efforts is because of the ostensibly liberal, benevolent image Google promotes, embodied in its famous motto, “Don’t be evil.”Google has a long history of ties to the Democratic Party, including an especially close relationship with the Obama White House. “When you allegedly promote values of diversity and inclusion you are asking to be held to a higher standard,” Hess said.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

(CREDO confirmed that it has the office phone numbers of dozens of Google staff members.)CREDO has also purchased Facebook ads featuring the video that are targeted at some 10,000 Google employees in the San Francisco Bay and Washington, D.C., areas.CREDO Action’s Heidi Hess, who is leading the new campaign to pressure Google, said that in the event that Trump begins to tone down his rhetoric as part of a general election strategy, the organization does not want corporations to excuse their ties to a Trump-led Republican party by claiming he never meant what he said.“The goal of the video is to make really clear to Google and to other corporations that are still considering whether or not to support the Republican National Convention, that when they support the convention, they are buying Trump’s platform along with the political access they are trying to buy,” Hess said.UltraViolet Action, an online women’s rights group, is taking a more tongue-in-cheek approach to pressuring the tech giant. The group announced on Monday that it was debuting a “Big Wig. Tiny Hands.” extension for Google Chrome. The extension, available for download at tinyhands.io, allows users to attach an image of Donald Trump’s hair to the Google logo on Google’s search engine homepage.Riva Litman, a Google spokeswoman, said Google’s goal in providing the live stream is to make the convention “accessible to millions of people (via YouTube) that can't be there in person.”Litman denied that the sponsorship represented any kind of an endorsement of Trump’s views, and noted that Google provided the same service for the conventions of both major parties in 2012. “This is a completely neutral, nonpartisan role -- and we aren't endorsing either party or candidate,” Litman said. “We're just there to provide access, information, and data.”The company has not yet announced plans to provide the live stream for the Democratic national convention in Philadelphia, which will take place later in July after the GOP convention.But CREDO Action rejects the notion of neutrality in a convention headlined by a hate-monger like Trump.“One of the major political parties has chosen to nominate a bigot,” Heidi Hess said. “It is not politics as usual. It is a real time for these companies to make a choice and decide what side of history they want to be on.”The progressive groups' new initiatives follow a petition campaign started by Color of Change and joined by CREDO Action, UltraViolet Action and other groups demanding that Google, Coca-Cola, Xerox, AT&T, Adobe Systems, Cisco and other companies cancel their plans to sponsor a “Donald Trump-led” Republican national convention in Cleveland this July.Activists from the organizations delivered more than 500,000 petition signatures to Google headquarters in Mountain View, California, last Thursday. As part of their action, a plane holding a banner with the message, “Google: Don’t be evil. #DumpTrump,” flew over Google headquarters and the San Francisco Bay. Notwithstanding the colorful protest and volume of petition signatures, Google announced that it had finalized its plans to provide the official live stream, and other associated services, for the convention.There are indications that other companies may be more responsive to the pressure, however. The New York Times reported on March 30 that Coca-Cola decided to donate $75,000 to the Republican national convention this year, down from its $660,000 donation to the GOP gathering in 2012. The company did not specify to the Times the reasons behind its decision, but the paper noted the Atlanta-based company’s investment in promoting its brand to communities of color. Color of Change’s version of the petition also featured Coca-Cola more prominently than any other corporation.One reason Google’s backing for the Republican National Convention has become a focal point of CREDO Action and UltraViolet Action’s efforts is because of the ostensibly liberal, benevolent image Google promotes, embodied in its famous motto, “Don’t be evil.”Google has a long history of ties to the Democratic Party, including an especially close relationship with the Obama White House. “When you allegedly promote values of diversity and inclusion you are asking to be held to a higher standard,” Hess said.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Garland described how, in the late 1980s, he helped prosecute a violent New York gang that moved to the nation's capitol, where it ""took over a public housing project"" and “terrorized” the residents.One key gang member, Richard Smith, was sentenced to life in prison plus 30 years following his conviction in 1989. Smith was supposed to die behind bars. But less than a week after Garland’s White House speech, a federal judge sent the 51-year-old inmate home.The story of how Smith went from being a federal lifer to walking free is complex -- much like the nation's sentencing laws. Smith was one of the first defendants convicted under the 1988 Anti-Drug Abuse Act, which mandated a life sentence for individuals involved in major drug trafficking rings.Smith, who was 24 when he was sentenced, was described as a ""principal lieutenant"" to the ringleader of a drug operation that supplied crack cocaine to dealers who operated out of the Mayfair Mansions housing complex a few miles east of the U.S. Capitol building. He was arrested with a gym bag containing 10 guns -- including a firearm that qualified as an automatic weapon, which drastically lengthened his prison term. When he was sentenced, the judge said that he had participated in a kidnapping and shootout, and alleged that he even pointed a gun at a police officer's chest on one occasion and at an officer's face on another occasion. Smith faced 23 counts, ranging from use of juveniles in drug trafficking to distribution of more than 50 grams of cocaine base. He was originally convicted on seven counts. Add in a substantial criminal history, and Smith was sentenced to a life term plus additional years. Later appeals and court rulings, including one from a panel that included the future Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, vacated some of those convictions, including the enhanced sentence for the machine gun charge.In 2008, Smith, then being held in a federal prison in Florida, successfully argued for a reduction in his prison term based on new sentencing guidelines for crack cocaine. Even with those reductions, his total sentence was still 33 years, which at that point would have meant he had several more years left behind bars. In 2014, the U.S. Sentencing Commission approved a measure allowing federal prisoners to ask the court to retroactively reduce their sentence under a restructuring of the mandatory drug sentencing laws. More than 26,000 federal inmates have had their prison terms reduced as a result of this change, according to the commission's data.Smith's lawyers reached an agreement with the federal government to avoid further litigation over his sentence, which shaved three more years off his time. With credit for not having any infractions while behind bars, he could be released immediately.Smith was discharged on March 22 of this year, just days after Garland mentioned the case at the White House. Smith was initially supposed to go to a halfway house for six months. But because his mother needed help taking care of his disabled brother, he was allowed to head straight home -- a situation that a prosecutor acknowledged was unusual.""This was the first guy who was virtually immediately released,"" said Assistant U.S. Attorney Barry Wiegand, who is handling sentencing reductions for hundreds of individuals who were sentenced in federal court in the District of Columbia. ""At first I wanted a halfway house, because it's hard for someone to serve years in the pen and then be dropped back on the street. When I came to learn that his mama needed help and he would care for her, I dropped the request.""Part of the reason the government agreed to the reduced sentencing, Smith's lawyer Patricia Daus said, was that ""people who may have done things in their 20s can mature.""At the hearing in which he was granted early release, U.S. District Judge Ellen Segal Huvelle noted that Smith had been locked up ""for a long time"" and said it's not easy for prisoners to re-enter society. ""I assume you will do fine, but I will be very disappointed if otherwise,"" she said.One of his first priorities will be securing a job, Smith said in an interview after his release. He's spending time with his daughter and three grandchildren, and helping his mother and brother at their home in the Bronx, where he last set foot in 1988. He's getting used to everything that changed while he was behind bars -- he said his ""mind is blown"" by smartphones. ""When I went in, we just had those big Macintosh computers. Now the screen is smaller ... harder for me to see, really,"" he said. His mother, Lois Smith, said she was shocked to learn that the man who helped send her son away for life had been nominated to the highest court in the land.""At the time, the government took them and made an example out of them. They got a lot of things wrong. He killed nobody. The time he did is outrageous,"" she said. ""They've had him for half of his life, and I just would like to have him for the rest of my life.""President Barack Obama nominated Garland on March 16 to fill the vacancy created by Justice Antonin Scalia's death. Garland, who currently serves as the chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, is seen as a centrist candidate with at least some shot at breaking down Republicans' resistance to holding a vote or even a hearing on Obama's choice. Polls show that a majority of Americans believe that the Senate should move forward with Garland’s nomination process -- although most don’t know who he is or have an opinion about him.Some critics have said that as a judge, Garland has sided too often with law enforcement, perhaps because of his time spent as a federal prosecutor. One prominent legal writer argued that Garland is ""to the right of Scalia on criminal justice."" He has rarely voted to overturn a criminal conviction and often gives prosecutors and police the benefit of the doubt.As Smith's own journey illustrates, there has been a shift in the nation's thinking about the type of harsh sentencing laws that were used against him nearly three decades ago. Congress has been considering reducing the length of certain mandatory minimum sentences for federal drug crimes, amidst increasing recognition that the sentence's length is not as much of a deterrent as its certainty, as well as the fact that older individuals are much less likely to commit crimes. Smith said he does not hold a grudge against Garland.""I'm not mad at him though. It was the guidelines, not him,"" Smith said. ""It wasn't about the conviction. It was about moving along with the guidelines and the war on drugs."""

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) thinks it's worth risking Hillary Clinton becoming president and nominating a liberal Supreme Court nominee versus confirming President Barack Obama's moderate pick.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572a599d160000e90031db33.jpeg?ops=crop_211_229_2789_1771%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A day after dropping out of a bitter presidential primary against GOP front-runner Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas) still thinks the next president should fill the Supreme Court vacancy -- even as some conservatives are starting to see President Barack Obama's nominee as their best hope.As of Tuesday night, it's all but decided that former Democratic Secretary of State and U.S. senator Hillary Clinton will go up against the TV reality star in November. It's not the way the GOP wanted this to go. Despite sweeping in the primaries, Trump is wildly unpopular in polls -- even more than Clinton -- and, at least based on current numbers, isn't likely to win the general election.Consider what that means for filling the Supreme Court seat. Republicans have a choice between confirming Obama's pick, Merrick Garland, a moderate middle-aged guy, or Clinton's nominee, a potentially younger and more progressive pick than Garland. Add to the mix that Democrats have a shot at reclaiming the Senate majority in November, which would put Republicans in an even weaker position for filling the court seat. In this scenario, Garland is clearly the better option.But Cruz, who was hoping to be the guy making decisions at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. next year, is sticking with his party's argument that Obama shouldn't get to make decisions about the Supreme Court because he's in his last year in office.""His position as expressed in his WSJ op/ed is not changed,"" Cruz spokesman Phil Novack told The Huffington Post on Wednesday. He's referring to a Wall Street Journal piece by Cruz, outlining the GOP's strategy of blocking Garland.The hitch for Republicans is that even if Trump does win, nobody really knows who he would put on the court. All he's said so far is that he would defer to the conservative Heritage Foundation for ideas. Even Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who is leading the blockade against Obama's pick, conceded ""it's a gamble"" to hold the Supreme Court seat open for Trump.It's a potential lose-lose scenario for the GOP. Some conservatives rang the alarm bells about this Tuesday as Trump became the party's presumptive nominee.Those concerns don't seem to be translating on Capitol Hill. The Huffington Post reached out to all 24 Republican senators* up for re-election to see if they prefer holding the court seat open for Clinton or Trump instead of voting on Obama's nominee. A handful responded. They all said yes.""Senator Scott believes the next President should choose who should fill the vacancy,"" said Sean Smith, spokesman for Sen. Tim Scott (S.C.).""Senator Lankford feels the same regarding Judge Garland,"" said Darrell Jordan, spokesman for Sen. Jim Lankford (Okla.). ""No hearings. No vote.""""His position remains the same,"" said Kevin Smith, spokesman for Sen. Rob Portman (Ohio).""Senator Coats continues to believe the right thing to do is to give the American people a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court justice,"" said Matt Lahr, spokesman for Sen. Dan Coats (Ind.).*Sen. Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) has already said Garland should get a vote."

But a U.S. judge overturned it last year, agreeing with conservation groups that the Fish and Wildlife Service had failed to properly assess impacts of the rule change on federally protected eagle populations.The revised proposal cites significant expansion within many sectors of the U.S. energy industry, particularly wind energy operations in the Western states, at a time when bald eagle numbers are growing while golden eagles appear to be in decline.Nevertheless, the Fish and Wildlife Service concluded that the U.S. population of roughly 40,000 golden eagles could endure the loss of about 2,000 birds a year without being pushed toward extinction. And the agency suggested that bald eagles, estimated to number about 143,000 nationwide, could sustain as many as 4,200 fatalities annually without endangering the species.The new proposal, which is open for public comment through July 5, would make wind farms and other energy developers responsible for monitoring eagle deaths from collisions with facility structures.That arrangement was decried by the American Bird Conservancy, which led the successful legal challenge against the previous eagle permit plan.The conservancy's Michael Hutchins said a system that relies on industry rather than government regulators to monitor and report problems fails to protect a beloved bird of prey stamped on the great seal of the United States.The American Wind Energy Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The number of eagles killed each year at wind facilities is not precisely known, according to the Fish and Wildlife Service. An estimated 545 golden eagles are thought to perish annually from collisions with obstacles ranging from turbines to vehicles, the agency said.(Editing by Steve Gorman and Sandra Maler)"

Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, doesn't sound particularly comfortable with sharing classified information with GOP presumptive nominee Donald Trump.""The practice of providing intelligence briefings to the presidential nominees of both parties is a sound one,"" Schiff said in a Thursday statement. ""Whether it is premature in the case of Donald Trump is one question; whether it would do any good is another.""Traditionally, Republican and Democratic presidential nominees start getting briefed on intelligence and homeland security matters after they are officially nominated at their party's conventions. That means Trump, and likely Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, will have access to sensitive information after July.The idea of Trump, who is notorious for his unfiltered, bombastic and extemporaneous manner of speech, getting briefed on classified material is already rattling some in the intelligence community. Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said earlier Thursday that he flat-out opposed briefing Trump on sensitive information because he worries the billionaire TV reality star would leak it for political gain.A spokesman for Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.), who chairs the House Intelligence Committee, said he is fine with briefing Trump on delicate matters.""The Chairman has said that, if requested, he would brief whomever the nominee is after the nomination is made official at the convention,"" said Nunes spokesman Jack Langer. ""That still applies.""Requests for comment from Sens.

""Those are assessments that will have to be made by the intelligence community,"" Earnest said. ""The president has full confidence in the ability of our professionals in the intelligence community to make those assessments.""As for whether the president has confidence in Clinton, who is currently under investigation for potentially mishandling classified information during her time as Secretary of State, the White House spokesman said yes.

16,POLITICS,How An Accused San Francisco Cop’s Rape Case Blew The Lid On A Racism Text Scandal,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/san-francisco-cops-racist-text_us_572a6b46e4b096e9f0903c83,Police knew about the texts for months before releasing them.,2016-05-05,"San Francisco police chief Greg Suhr (L) and FBI Special Agent in Charge David Johnson (R) hold a news conference to discuss the arrest of San Francisco political and media consultant Ryan Chamberlain on June 3, 2014 in San Francisco, California.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5861934f1500002300915f3d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SAN FRANCISCO -- The San Francisco Police Department has been hit hard in recent days by yet another scandal involving offensive text messages. But what's remarkable is that the hateful language even came to light.Authorities recently arrested a retired lieutenant and a former officer on separate charges, and in the midst of that scandal has further been embarrassed by the release of a batch of racist and homophobic messages between them and two other cops. The messages that included derogatory remarks about several marginalized groups, including blacks, Latinos and LGBT people, emerged while authorities probed the cops over allegations that one had raped a woman in August -- yet San Francisco Police Chief Greg Suhr only loosened his grip on the texts last Friday.That came two days after the district attorney's office filed charges against former Lt. Curtis Liu for allegedly tipping off Jason Lai that he'd been accused of rape and for later lying to supervisors about it. The slowly building and complicated controversy took a turn on Wednesday, when Liu denied through his attorney to Bay City News that he was the source of any of the texts that have shocked the famously open-minded city. Liu also pled not guilty Wednesday to charges that he interfered with the police investigation into the rape accusation against Lai while both were still members of the force. This is the second time since late 2014 that the public has learned that groups of city cops used derogatory language in messages to each other. The department appeared reluctant to release this second set of messages, but ultimately relented amid growing public pressure. The latest blemish for the department originated with allegations that Lai raped a woman that he'd met on patrol. Authorities didn't prosecute Lai for the alleged sexual attack, but the internal affairs division and district attorney have since said that they uncovered other wrongdoing. In March, Lai was busted on misdemeanor charges of misusing data from criminal and motor vehicle records. He's pleaded not guilty.Days after Lai faced charges, the police department revealed that Lai and three others ""had sent text messages containing reprehensible racial and homophobic remarks,"" according to a statement. The department said it had known about the material for months and that the officers had been suspended in the fall while the Police Commission evaluated how to discipline them. Initially, Suhr's office declined to release the contents of the messages, because charges were pending against Liu. Public pressure, however, rose quickly. The city's public defender Jeff Adachi called for an immediate investigation.The first glimpse of the messages came weeks later on April 26 almost by chance. Adachi's office recently obtained some of the texts, because it was defending a robbery suspect and Lai had been one of the cops involved in his arrest. As part of the discovery process, the district attorney gave the public defender Lai's texts that had been found while the rape accusation was being investigated. Lai wrote that blacks were ""barbarians,"" and like ""a pack of wild animals on the loose."" He also used a Cantonese insult for blacks and wrote ""too bad none of them died."" The texts also insulted Latinos, Indians and LGBT people.That was just the tip of the iceberg, according to Adachi. He called for more texts to be released, and said that at least 207 criminal cases, including three murders, should be reviewed to see if Lai's apparent biases influenced the outcome. “It is chilling how casually former officer Lai dehumanizes the citizens he was sworn to serve,” Adachi said in a statement at the time. “He wished violence upon the very people he was being paid to protect and none of his colleagues turned him in.”The larger pool of texts, that were released on April 29, included slurs like ""nigger"" and ""beaner,"" to talk about suspects and used ""gay"" as an insult for coworkers. The names of the senders and recipients were redacted:""We think it is important for the public to know that we conducted the investigation, discovered the texts and took immediate action, and that those responsible for such hateful texts are no longer police officers,” Suhr said. ""Those former members betrayed the public’s trust and the trust of the right-minded, hard-working men and women of the San Francisco Police Department.""Suhr and Mayor Ed Lee scrambled to quickly control the outcry. Suhr announced that all officers would complete anti-harassment training, the Associated Press reported. Lee, meanwhile, wrote a letter to the city's 2,100 police officers asking them to report colleagues who display bigoted attitudes or behavior. The police department has been reeling for months, as it faced widespread criticism for a series of controversial fatal shootings by officers that have led to calls for Suhr to resign and prompted the Department of Justice to investigate. Five hunger strikers demanding Suhr's ouster have camped outside the police station in the Mission neighborhood for two weeks."

Her fifth-grade student had jumped from his chair and was climbing onto his desk. “Sit down in your chair right now, please,” said head teacher Margaret Paulk, supervising from the back of the classroom. Her tone had the don’t-mess-with-me authority of a 25-year teaching veteran, and, even while chatting with a visiting reporter, Paulk’s gaze never left her students.Velásquez looked embarrassed. “I’m sorry, it was my fault. I just asked him to get a pencil,” she said quietly to Paulk, unnerved by how quickly a peaceful literary lesson had unraveled into papers-flying, table-rocking chaos as she and her Seattle Teacher Residency (STR) colleagues attempted to teach 17 elementary school students, five of whom get special education support.The day’s assignment, called Studio Day, is a four-times-a-year hands-on workshop, a sort of A-to-Z instructional think tank for lesson prep and teaching, with a heavy emphasis on group troubleshooting and feedback. Velásquez and her fellow grad students had spent the morning preparing the lesson; after lunch, their classmate Alicia Nicas taught it to the fifth-graders while the group observed and stepped in for one-on-one work with several students. At day’s end, the student teachers and their University of Washington professors would gather to deconstruct the day’s work.STR stands out from many teacher training programs because its graduates enter the workforce with a dual teaching degree: general education or special education, plus a desirable extra certification that will better-prepare them to teach children with special needs or children who are not fluent in English. This is unusual among teacher training programs and vital for the jobs STR graduates will eventually fill in Seattle’s public schools. “Residencies build pipelines of teachers in response to very specific district needs,” said Anissa Listak, executive director of the National Center for Teacher Residencies, via email. “These are teachers that are unlike any other being produced by local providers.” (STR is one of 658 alternative teacher prep programs nationwide according to a 2013 U.S. Department of Education report.)Related: What happens when teachers spend more time in a classroom — before teaching? Many teacher preparation programs have been criticized for failing to provide enough high-quality classroom experience for teachers-in-training, but Velásquez and her 30 classmates will spend four days per week, for the duration of their 14 months in graduate school, learning and teaching alongside seasoned, carefully vetted and paid mentor teachers in Seattle Public Schools.While many first-year teachers report feeling under-prepared and ineffective, Velásquez is part of a cohort of 76 STR graduates and residents with a reputation for high-level performance right out of the blocks. To keep teachers at their jobs longer, STR asks that each of its graduates make a five-year commitment to a high-poverty Seattle school; with their dual degrees, Velásquez and her classmates will make a dent in Washington’s severe teacher shortage. As a woman of color, she will help fulfill the residency’s mandate to recruit and supply a racially diverse pool of new teachers.And yet, STR teeters on the brink of survival.STR is financially unstable, is too expensive to operate and is not producing enough teachers, argues the Seattle School Board, a key partner in the residency. The board’s loss of faith highlights the fundamental crisis undermining the program: Successful residencies require multiple players harmoniously working together — school districts, university or college teaching programs and fundraising entities. Without a healthy working relationship between the partners that created STR, Maria-Elena Velásquez and her classmates may be among its last graduates.Toward the end of Studio Day, visibly exhausted, Velásquez and her classmates gathered around a library table at Adams Elementary School, snacking on popcorn and tangerines. Paulk, the fifth-grade teacher, joined them for the post-lesson brain dump. “I’m so jealous of your program,” said Paulk to the group. “When I was studying to be a teacher, my student teaching lasted just one week.”Related: The first year of teaching can feel like a fraternity hazing The Studio Day lesson — weaving similes and metaphors into love poems — was overseen by a University of Washington literacy instructor and a special education instructor. This co-teaching model is unique to Studio Day and helped the grad students pay special attention to various learning differences among the fifth-graders. Having a special education professor in the room also allowed the teachers-in-training to grapple with a few of the challenges they will encounter at their future jobs.“I noticed a few of the kids had inflatable bumpy cushions to sit on and fidget toys,” said Velásquez’s classmate James Dixon, who is currently employed as a paraprofessional in a Seattle public school while earning his teaching degree through STR. “How will I go about getting those types of supports when I’m working in a Title 1 school? Where do I get money for that?”Seattle’s residency program originated in 2011 when Seattle Public Schools, the Alliance for Education (which raises money for the school district) and the University of Washington’s College of Education agreed to join forces to address Washington state’s teacher needs.“The beginnings were very organic,” said Sara Morris, president and CEO of the Alliance for Education. “It was a kismet moment and we were interested in what was happening with the residency model in Boston. As close colleagues, we sat down and said, ‘We should do this here.’ ” These three partners were soon joined by the teachers’ union, the Seattle Education Association. “There were very few challenges at the beginning,” said Morris. “And having the teachers’ union as a partner eliminated so many potential roadblocks.”But in short order, a whirlwind of leadership turnover — five superintendents in the last decade -- led the partnership to a very public impasse that pitted the school district against its fundraising partner, the alliance. “We can no longer allocate our limited amount of leadership resources to initiatives with low system-wide impact or high costs,” wrote district Superintendent Larry Nyland in a letter to the alliance in October 2015. “We need funds for high-leverage initiatives with broad student impact.”Nyland and the school board, who did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this article, noted that the alliance failed to support the district’s funding priorities, had not sustained adequate funding levels and had become a “critical friend” to the district — frequently challenging its decisions and authority — rather than an ally. “There was no issue with the quality or scope of the residency itself,” said Morris, the alliance president. “I think if you strip away the emotion, the district was saying: ‘We just want you to be a traditional school foundation. We want to hand you a list of 50 things we need money for, you raise the money and give it to us and that’s the end of the conversation.’ But that’s not how we operate. We are recognized as an accountable entity that has oversight; there is no funder who will just write a check and say, ‘use it as you like.’ ”The souring of the partnership reached its apex in November 2015 when the school board voted to end its relationship with the alliance, or, at a minimum, restructure it significantly. Along with this public dressing down, the school district cut its annual financial contribution to STR from $230,000 in 2015-16 to a projected $50,000 for 2016-17, according to STR spokesperson Jami Sheets. The residency program’s costs are expected to exceed $1.5 million in 2015-16, with the expenses divvied up between the district, private donors and federal funds.“This has been a very intense and public unraveling of what we had hoped would be a strong partnership,” said Listak, of the National Center for Teacher Residencies, which supports 22 residencies nationwide with technical assistance and networking. “Whatever this political in-fighting is all about, it’s become an adult issue and is not at all about kids and education.” These relationship woes are not entirely uncommon among residencies, she noted, although they occur more frequently between a university and a school district.“We want to empower school districts to be more active players in teacher prep,” said Listak. “The flip side to that model is that when you have major turnover within a district, it will create challenges in the partnership. You are prone to the priorities of leadership when you are in service to a district.”Related: The exhausting life of a first-year teacherStudio Day at Adams Elementary was wrapping up. Alicia Nicas, the a 37-year-old STR grad student on a special education track who had volunteered to be the day’s demo teacher, decompressed at the library table with her classmates. Nicas looked visibly relieved to have survived the day’s exercise. She’d conquered her pre-performance jitters and delivered a strong lesson to the crowded classroom filled with Paulk’s fifth-graders, plus 11 fellow students and the University of Washington instructors observing her work.Nicas, a single mom of two daughters, picked STR for many reasons but among the most important: the $16,500 student stipend, paid out monthly over the course of the program. “That was huge. I looked at other programs but I couldn’t afford any of them without financial support,” she said. This despite the fact that, “because I’m on a special education track, there’s a much bigger loan forgiveness.”Still, Nicas and her classmates must pony up $27,560 tuition for the University of Washington’s five-quarter program. Even with a monthly stipend, this creates a huge challenge for STR as it tries to recruit racially and socio-economically diverse future teachers. Although STR offered a full tuition refund in its first year, it can no longer afford to do so. “If you have high tuition, you’re going to have a hard time recruiting diverse applicants,” said Listak. “Diversity is literally linked to that value package.”Tuition does not cover all the program's costs. This year, according to the alliance, it will cost an additional $50,000 (a slight increase over the prior two years) to prepare each teacher via the Seattle residency. Listak maintains this is not more expensive than traditional teacher prep programs and its costs are offset by district savings due to having less teacher attrition.Not everyone agrees with her big-picture analysis. Sandi Jacobs, senior vice president for state and district policy at the National Council on Teacher Quality, feels that it’s time to circle back to traditional teacher prep programs.“Given the cost of residencies, we think much more attention needs to be paid to how to improve the student teaching component in traditional teacher preparation programs,” said Jacobs. “Districts and [university] programs can work together to make the student teacher experience similarly intensive.”Right now, the alliance and Seattle Public Schools are licking their wounds and expectations are dialed way back. The hoped-for benchmark of training 60 teachers each year beginning in 2018 has been halved. The original financial model, in which the school district would shoulder 51 percent of the program’s annual cost by 2018, has been scaled back to a tentative one-third model in which STR’s costs will be shared equally among the district, federal or state funds and private donors.Meanwhile, the alliance has found a new dance partner. In 2017, backed by a $90,000 grant from Boeing Co., STR will begin training high school science, technology, engineering and math teachers for jobs in four neighboring South King County school districts.“[The South King County school districts] have seen the value and understand it, even with just a minimal amount of exposure to the program,” said Marisa Bier, STR’s program director. “I think there’s a possibility the [Seattle Public School] district will decide not to continue supporting the residency. But the residency is seen as a national model, and if the district decides it doesn’t want to be part of this, there are other districts that do.”This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

As a woman of color, she will help fulfill the residency’s mandate to recruit and supply a racially diverse pool of new teachers.And yet, STR teeters on the brink of survival.STR is financially unstable, is too expensive to operate and is not producing enough teachers, argues the Seattle School Board, a key partner in the residency. The board’s loss of faith highlights the fundamental crisis undermining the program: Successful residencies require multiple players harmoniously working together — school districts, university or college teaching programs and fundraising entities. Without a healthy working relationship between the partners that created STR, Maria-Elena Velásquez and her classmates may be among its last graduates.Toward the end of Studio Day, visibly exhausted, Velásquez and her classmates gathered around a library table at Adams Elementary School, snacking on popcorn and tangerines. Paulk, the fifth-grade teacher, joined them for the post-lesson brain dump. “I’m so jealous of your program,” said Paulk to the group. “When I was studying to be a teacher, my student teaching lasted just one week.”Related: The first year of teaching can feel like a fraternity hazing The Studio Day lesson — weaving similes and metaphors into love poems — was overseen by a University of Washington literacy instructor and a special education instructor. This co-teaching model is unique to Studio Day and helped the grad students pay special attention to various learning differences among the fifth-graders. Having a special education professor in the room also allowed the teachers-in-training to grapple with a few of the challenges they will encounter at their future jobs.“I noticed a few of the kids had inflatable bumpy cushions to sit on and fidget toys,” said Velásquez’s classmate James Dixon, who is currently employed as a paraprofessional in a Seattle public school while earning his teaching degree through STR. “How will I go about getting those types of supports when I’m working in a Title 1 school? Where do I get money for that?”Seattle’s residency program originated in 2011 when Seattle Public Schools, the Alliance for Education (which raises money for the school district) and the University of Washington’s College of Education agreed to join forces to address Washington state’s teacher needs.“The beginnings were very organic,” said Sara Morris, president and CEO of the Alliance for Education. “It was a kismet moment and we were interested in what was happening with the residency model in Boston. As close colleagues, we sat down and said, ‘We should do this here.’ ” These three partners were soon joined by the teachers’ union, the Seattle Education Association. “There were very few challenges at the beginning,” said Morris. “And having the teachers’ union as a partner eliminated so many potential roadblocks.”But in short order, a whirlwind of leadership turnover — five superintendents in the last decade -- led the partnership to a very public impasse that pitted the school district against its fundraising partner, the alliance. “We can no longer allocate our limited amount of leadership resources to initiatives with low system-wide impact or high costs,” wrote district Superintendent Larry Nyland in a letter to the alliance in October 2015. “We need funds for high-leverage initiatives with broad student impact.”Nyland and the school board, who did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this article, noted that the alliance failed to support the district’s funding priorities, had not sustained adequate funding levels and had become a “critical friend” to the district — frequently challenging its decisions and authority — rather than an ally. “There was no issue with the quality or scope of the residency itself,” said Morris, the alliance president. “I think if you strip away the emotion, the district was saying: ‘We just want you to be a traditional school foundation. We want to hand you a list of 50 things we need money for, you raise the money and give it to us and that’s the end of the conversation.’ But that’s not how we operate. We are recognized as an accountable entity that has oversight; there is no funder who will just write a check and say, ‘use it as you like.’ ”The souring of the partnership reached its apex in November 2015 when the school board voted to end its relationship with the alliance, or, at a minimum, restructure it significantly. Along with this public dressing down, the school district cut its annual financial contribution to STR from $230,000 in 2015-16 to a projected $50,000 for 2016-17, according to STR spokesperson Jami Sheets. The residency program’s costs are expected to exceed $1.5 million in 2015-16, with the expenses divvied up between the district, private donors and federal funds.“This has been a very intense and public unraveling of what we had hoped would be a strong partnership,” said Listak, of the National Center for Teacher Residencies, which supports 22 residencies nationwide with technical assistance and networking. “Whatever this political in-fighting is all about, it’s become an adult issue and is not at all about kids and education.” These relationship woes are not entirely uncommon among residencies, she noted, although they occur more frequently between a university and a school district.“We want to empower school districts to be more active players in teacher prep,” said Listak. “The flip side to that model is that when you have major turnover within a district, it will create challenges in the partnership. You are prone to the priorities of leadership when you are in service to a district.”Related: The exhausting life of a first-year teacherStudio Day at Adams Elementary was wrapping up. Alicia Nicas, the a 37-year-old STR grad student on a special education track who had volunteered to be the day’s demo teacher, decompressed at the library table with her classmates. Nicas looked visibly relieved to have survived the day’s exercise. She’d conquered her pre-performance jitters and delivered a strong lesson to the crowded classroom filled with Paulk’s fifth-graders, plus 11 fellow students and the University of Washington instructors observing her work.Nicas, a single mom of two daughters, picked STR for many reasons but among the most important: the $16,500 student stipend, paid out monthly over the course of the program. “That was huge. I looked at other programs but I couldn’t afford any of them without financial support,” she said. This despite the fact that, “because I’m on a special education track, there’s a much bigger loan forgiveness.”Still, Nicas and her classmates must pony up $27,560 tuition for the University of Washington’s five-quarter program. Even with a monthly stipend, this creates a huge challenge for STR as it tries to recruit racially and socio-economically diverse future teachers. Although STR offered a full tuition refund in its first year, it can no longer afford to do so. “If you have high tuition, you’re going to have a hard time recruiting diverse applicants,” said Listak. “Diversity is literally linked to that value package.”Tuition does not cover all the program's costs. This year, according to the alliance, it will cost an additional $50,000 (a slight increase over the prior two years) to prepare each teacher via the Seattle residency. Listak maintains this is not more expensive than traditional teacher prep programs and its costs are offset by district savings due to having less teacher attrition.Not everyone agrees with her big-picture analysis. Sandi Jacobs, senior vice president for state and district policy at the National Council on Teacher Quality, feels that it’s time to circle back to traditional teacher prep programs.“Given the cost of residencies, we think much more attention needs to be paid to how to improve the student teaching component in traditional teacher preparation programs,” said Jacobs. “Districts and [university] programs can work together to make the student teacher experience similarly intensive.”Right now, the alliance and Seattle Public Schools are licking their wounds and expectations are dialed way back. The hoped-for benchmark of training 60 teachers each year beginning in 2018 has been halved. The original financial model, in which the school district would shoulder 51 percent of the program’s annual cost by 2018, has been scaled back to a tentative one-third model in which STR’s costs will be shared equally among the district, federal or state funds and private donors.Meanwhile, the alliance has found a new dance partner. In 2017, backed by a $90,000 grant from Boeing Co., STR will begin training high school science, technology, engineering and math teachers for jobs in four neighboring South King County school districts.“[The South King County school districts] have seen the value and understand it, even with just a minimal amount of exposure to the program,” said Marisa Bier, STR’s program director. “I think there’s a possibility the [Seattle Public School] district will decide not to continue supporting the residency. But the residency is seen as a national model, and if the district decides it doesn’t want to be part of this, there are other districts that do.”This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education.

20,POLITICS,How The NRA Is Making Bank Off Of Urban Gun Violence,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chicago-nra-gun-violence_us_57292f57e4b0bc9cb045133c,A new documentary puts the powerful gun lobby in its crosshairs.,2016-05-05,"Pam Bosley stands inside the St. Sabina Catholic Church with a photograph of her son, Terrell, who was gunned down in 2006. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Chicago’s long-standing bad rap on gun violence drew fresh attention in the first months of 2016 when early numbers suggested that the city was facing one of its worst homicide rates in years. Throughout the decades-long debate over the city’s seemingly intractable gun violence problem, there's little consensus on what's behind the scourge; citizens have blamed everything from gang members to gun regulation to scrutiny of the police. In his new documentary, filmmaker Robert Greenwald suggests a different root cause: the NRA. In the recently released ""Making a Killing: Guns, Greed, and the NRA,"" Greenwald explores how the lucrative gun industry and the powerful gun lobby puts profit over people by scuttling legislative efforts to address even the most common-sense gun law reforms.""There’s a profit motive here,” Greenwald said. ""Many of these parents are paying a terrible price for it.”The film eschews policy experts and talking heads in favor of those who have been directly affected by gun violence. Among them is Pam Bosley, a Chicago mother whose 18-year-old son, Terrell, was shot on the steps of his church en route to choir practice.Bosley's name is one of several -- like Hadiya Pendleton, Jonylah Watkins and most recently, Tyshawn Lee -- that have become shorthand in national headlines for Chicago's gun problem. Yet the pervasive nature of the killings has done little to shift the national dialogue around guns.Particularly in Chicago, Greenwald said the NRA and other gun lobbyists have long exploited racial stereotypes to shape perceptions of urban gun violence by talking in coded terms that tie the problem to “thugs” or “gun runners.” “They talk about Chicago being the Wild, Wild West and there’s no doubt in my mind that there’s a strong racial bias that’s not stated overtly,” he said.Father Michael Pfleger, the city's most politically active Catholic priest, takes exception to the way the NRA and its pro-gun sympathizers characterize Chicago's gun violence victims.""Some of the things they say about our kids -- being gangbangers and whatnot -- it's unbelievable,"" Pfleger said during a March screening of the film at his St. Sabina church on the city's South Side. The false narrative that urban gun violence is exclusively ""gangbangers shooting gangbangers"" is just a convenient excuse to not empathize with the problem -- and it lets people wave it off as unrelated to the efforts of the gun lobby, Pfleger said. ""The NRA has been a master at convincing people 'guns make you safer,'"" he said. ""Until we connect the dots that what happens on the South Side, or Newtown, or to Gabby Giffords can happen anywhere, anybody is a target."" Greenwald brought his film to Plfeger's church, where more than half of the attendees at the screening raised their hands when asked if their lives had been touched by gun violence. ""We want to connect personal pain with public policy,"" Greenwald said. ""It’s important to connect them to the fact that legislation would have stopped Pam’s son from being shot on the steps of the church.""Bosley repeatedly has said that there was no accountability following Terrell's death. Last year, Bosley and the mother of another shooting victim filed a lawsuit against three suburban gun stores. They argued the stores don’t adequately regulate gun sales near the city-suburb border with Chicago, where gun laws are comparatively stricter.""If her son had had an accident on a rusty nail, there would be more possible accountability,"" Greenwald said. ""But a lethal weapon? There is no accountability. No legal or moral repercussions."" The NRA did not respond to a request for comment.Outside of Chicago, Greenwald's film argues that people have lost their lives due to the gun lobby’s efforts to remove any hindrance to buying firearms. Because of the NRA’s opposition to firearm regulation — including gun storage laws or waiting periods — the film argues children have been injured in gun accidents, domestic violence victims have been killed by abusers, and overall, everyone has easier access to deadly weapons.""In any one of these tragedies, in any one of these incidents, take away the gun and look how different the situation is,” Greenwald said. Data indicates that the NRA remains so steadfastly successful in its mission that even the massacre of 20 schoolchildren and six adults in the 2012 Newtown school shooting couldn't slow its efforts. Nationwide, states actually trended toward weaker gun laws in Newtown's wake. ""The NRA has made us think they are all-powerful. Really, they are just the mouthpieces of these companies that have the money to buy members of Congress,"" said Rep. Jan Schakowsky (D-Ill.), who has an F rating from the NRA on pro-gun issues. Fledgling and struggling politicians are especially susceptible to the NRA’s powerful draw, Greenwald said.""If you're a politician and you align with the NRA, you know you’re going to be well-funded and you’re going to have passionate people behind you,"" the filmmaker said. ""It’s hard to think rationally when your paycheck is written by the devil,"" he added. ""Not that money explains everything, but the money certainly does distort one’s perspective.” The famously secretive lobby wasn't always that way, Greenwald said. ""A shift happened around 1971 or 1972; there was a sort of a takeover by a more radical faction,"" Greenwald said. ""Instead of hunters and conservationists, [members] were lobbying for the gun companies."" The film names Wayne LaPierre, the CEO and executive vice president of the NRA, as one of the gun advocates who orchestrated the shift. (Greenwald noted LaPierre and other NRA leaders were “not really interested” in talking to him about the film.) Greenwald said he hopes the film, which can be screened for free, will help build the kind of momentum that eventually prompted life-saving regulations in the once-untouchable tobacco and auto industries. ""The solutions are so varied and so simple in some cases that it’s truly mind-boggling,"" Greenwald said. ""We’ll look back on this, our grandchildren will look back on this, and wonder that this even existed."""

For the active ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers) member and writer, sharing insights on the business of the music industry with the youth is a void that needs to be fulfilled by the established, veteran stars for the betterment of music.The multi-platinum, singer-songwriter was among the many musicians on hand to share their wealth of music knowledge during this year's 11th annual ASCAP ""I Create Music"" Expo in Los Angeles on April 28. Featuring keynote speaker Timbaland, the three-day event, which is dedicated to songwriters, composers, artists and producers, included performances from the likes of McKnight and also provided informative sessions for music creators.""I think one of the problems with music today is that very few of the really good people in this business very rarely go back to even talk to the kids who are coming up, or inspiring the people who are coming up, to give them some insight as to how we did it,"" McKnight said to The Huffington Post. ""I think the people that did it for my generation were the Stevie Wonders and the Lionel Richies of our day, and I think it's very important that we do the same thing for this next generation of people, because if we don't they'll be left to their own devices and having to fend for themselves.""The ""Anytime"" crooner went on to tell HuffPost how Prince's legal battle with Warner Bros. in 1993 to retain control over his music can be used as a valuable lesson for artists who may be negotiating their own record deal today.""Most of us artists have no idea how valuable what we do is actually worth,"" he said. ""So when you talk about being a businessman, you have to do both, because fame and fortune don't always go hand in hand... If you can get successful and powerful enough, you can sort of get back some of those things that belong to you. But as we see, as Prince is now gone and didn't have a will, so people are going to be fighting over $300 million dollars… it should be a lesson to everyone, when you're going into negotiation that is something that you should want and need to have back at some point."" As for his thoughts on artists being vocal on social justice issues and incorporating those messages into their music, McKnight says now is ""the perfect time to do that."" One artist in particular that he considers to be at the forefront of uplifting the masses is none other than Beyoncé.""Beyoncé, to me, she's the one artist that's been able to bridge the gap between the hay day of our day and really continuing to make strides at a time when it's almost impossible,"" he said. ""So whatever she does, obviously she's one of the only people in the world that's able to do that, but it's pretty amazing to see, whether it's her vision or the people that are around her, what she's able to do and what she's allowed to do is an inspiration to everyone, because she's doing it on her own terms. Especially for a female in this business. There's very few females in this business that has this kind of power. So it's really amazing to see.""In addition to his contribution to the ""I Create Music"" Expo, in February, McKnight released his new album, the first in three years, titled, ""Better."" The singer-songwriter also inked a label and distribution agreement with The Sono Recording Group in April, with plans of signing new talent and releasing his first live DVD this fall.Check out pictures from the 11th annual ASCAP ""I Create Music"" Expo below.

22,BUSINESS,How (Not) To Prevent The Next Big Financial Bubble,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/federal-reserve-interest-rates-financial-bubble_us_572a4abde4b096e9f09018d6,The Federal Reserve is essential. But which tools it should use is up for debate.,2016-05-05,Federal Reserve chairwoman Janet Yellen faces new pressure to raise interest rates. But is doing so the best way to curb a potential financial bubble?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572a4f6c1300002900380899.jpeg?cache=tODAgeW4Ug&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Federal Reserve should not increase interest rates in order to deflate financial asset bubbles, two progressive economists argue in a policy brief released Thursday. Dean Baker and Josh Bivens' analysis, “The wrong tool for the right job,” tries to rebut an increasingly common argument for a Fed interest rate hike that could hit Americans in their wallets.Baker and Bivens, of the Center for Economic and Policy Research and the Economic Policy Institute, respectively, marshal existing research to cast doubt on the idea that raising rates is an effective way to curb asset prices. And they maintain that since raising rates puts downward pressure on job growth, doing so to combat an asset bubble risks causing economic pain in the name of uncertain gains. Instead, they make the case for using targeted financial regulations to achieve the same goal without the unnecessary ""collateral damage.""What economists call an asset “bubble” is when prices for a particular financial asset -- such as housing, stocks or bonds -- vastly exceed the asset’s inherent value. The proverbial asset bubble then tends to burst abruptly when investors realize there is not a rational basis for the investment craze, pushing prices into a tailspin that can send tremors throughout the economy.The 2000s-era housing bubble is at the heart of the contemporary policy debate about the Federal Reserve, because it was the largest and most economically devastating bubble in recent U.S. history. Some analysts believe that the Federal Reserve could have prevented that catastrophic bubble had it increased the influential federal funds rate (the interest rate at which banks lend to one another using funds held at the Federal Reserve) sooner and more dramatically. The Fed increases this benchmark rate to head off excessive inflation. The cost of borrowing throughout the economy that's tied to that benchmark, including certain kinds of home loans, then also rises. It is a cycle that ultimately lowers prices. (The knock-on effect on other interest rates is why raising the singular federal funds rate is often described as raising interest “rates.”)If the Fed had made it more expensive to borrow in order to buy a home, the thinking goes, the housing bubble could have been much smaller or avoided entirely.There is a trade-off baked into that decision though: Those same rate increases are designed to put a damper on economic demand, which risks slowing the pace of job growth. Now a host of important figures, from Kansas City Regional Federal Reserve Bank president Esther George to likely Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, are calling on the Fed to raise the benchmark rate out of concerns that we are once again enabling a financial asset bubble.Historically, the Federal Reserve raises its influential federal funds rate to head off the rising price of goods, not assets. The central bank has a dual mandate to maintain price stability and full employment. But the prices of consumer goods have grown at a rate that's consistently under the Fed's 2 percent inflation target, leaving inflation hawks with little evidence to push for a rate hike.Bivens posited that the turn to citing asset bubble fears is ""window dressing"" for people who want to raise rates for various other reasons after so many years when the benchmark rate was at or near zero. ""It is a kind of ex-post justification,"" he said.Thus far, Fed chairwoman Janet Yellen and most of her colleagues have resisted these calls, rejecting the notion that there is a financial bubble driving current economic growth.The Fed raised the benchmark rate to between 0.25 and 0.5 percent in December, the first increase since the financial crisis. It has since decided to hold off on additional increases amid fears of a slowdown in global markets and an appreciating dollar. (Esther George dissented from the Fed decision-making body's March and April rate announcements.)Central bank officials will next convene on June 14-15 to decide once more whether it is time to raise the benchmark rate.But progressive economists like Baker and Bivens are not taking any chances, since they believe the Fed has a long history of prioritizing inflation fears at the expense of workers.And the stakes are high. Despite a record streak of job creation, wage growth has been sluggish, raising the possibility that even a modest change in economic conditions could slow down progress even further.Baker and Bivens do not directly address the question of whether an asset bubble is currently developing. Rather, they try to demonstrate why low interest rates were not in themselves responsible for the 2000s housing bubble, in order to argue that raising them is an inappropriate way to avoid future bubbles.U.S. home prices began their sharp rise in the late 1990s, a time when the Fed was increasing the benchmark rate, they point out. And the economists note that the housing sector continued to roar from 2004 to 2006, when the Fed was steadily raising rates.In addition, Baker and Bivens draw on 2010 research by then-Fed chair Ben Bernanke to highlight that many countries where central banks made credit harder to come by than the U.S. -- relative to the specific economic conditions -- actually had bigger housing booms during the 2000s.In lieu of rate increases that could have unintended economic consequences, Baker and Bivens' analysis calls for the Fed to use its powers of “communication” and regulatory authority to rein in bubbles when it sees them developing. That means the Fed chair would use her bully pulpit to call out sectors of the economy that are growing irrationally, indicating her clear intention to deflate it through regulatory action or other means if investors do not act on their own.The Fed then has the authority, according to Baker and Bivens, to raise the minimum down payment on home mortgages, for example, in order to preclude reckless borrowing. It can also raise capital requirements for the large financial institutions it oversees.Joseph Gagnon, a monetary policy expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, who was an economist at the Fed for many years, agrees with Baker and Bivens that the central bank should not raise rates in order to curb potential bubbles when better tools are available.“Raising interest rates is a shotgun approach, shooting pellets all over the economy,” Gagnon said. “But if you use regulatory policy, it is like a rifle. It focuses in on the problem and does not affect everything else.”Mark Calabria, a Fed watcher at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he is skeptical that many of the regulatory changes needed to really prevent asset bubbles are politically feasible.“It is highly unrealistic that we are going to start ratcheting back mortgage eligibility because we are still a country that loves homeownership that much,” he said.Given that reality, he contended, interest rates should be “part of our tool set,” even as he acknowledged their effects on asset bubbles are not completely clear.“Whereas [Baker and Bivens] see the connection between interest rates and asset prices as being fuzzy, I see the connection between interest rates and jobs being fuzzier,” he concluded."

Removing them would cause a slump of $381.5 billion to $623.2 billion in private sector output, the Washington-based non-profit said in its analysis.The study added that removing those workers could leave potentially millions of jobs unfilled due to a lack of legal workers willing to do them. Industries with the highest share of undocumented workers include farming, construction, and hospitality, according to the research.""The things Donald Trump has said are utterly unworkable,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the forum's president, and the top economic adviser to Senator John McCain's 2008 presidential campaign. Trump, who effectively sealed the Republican nomination this week, has called for thedeportation of anyone living in the United States illegally, arguing foreign workers hold down salaries and contribute to unemployment.That position has drawn strong opposition from business leaders like the conservative billionaire Koch brothers as well as from human rights advocates. Trump has further angered opponents by saying Mexico was sending rapists and drug dealers to the United States, and by calling for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the country to shore up national security.But his hard line stance on immigration has also triggered strong support among many U.S. voters.Some 52.6 percent of respondents to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in September said they want to see most or all undocumented immigrants deported, compared with 34.6 percent who want to see most or all of them stay.The American Action Forum analysis used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to estimate the value of the output from undocumented immigrants. It also concluded that there would not likely be enough legal employees in these sectors to fill the vacancies that would result from massdeportations.The study did not factor in potential impacts of mass deportations on consumption, investment and other economic factors, the group said.The U.S. economy is projected to produce some $18.7 trillion worth of goods and services in 2016, according to the International Monetary Fund. A loss of $400 billion in output would amount to about 2 percent of that figure.(Editing by Richard Valdmanis and Alistair Bell)"

The feminist icon responded to the presumptive GOP presidential nominee's assertion that Hillary Clinton plays the ""woman card.""""I think [Donald Trump] is playing the testosterone card,"" said Steinem, pausing for a moment. ""No, I don't wanna say that because both women and men have testosterone. He's playing the masculinity card, because gender... is totally made up and we can unmake it up. He doesn't know that.""Trump has talked about the supposed ""woman card"" before, but last week he doubled down on that rhetoric. ""If Hillary Clinton were a man, I don’t think she would get 5 percent of the vote,"" he said.L'sigh. We'll be trying to tune out Trump for the next six months and tune in to what Gloria Steinem has to say, instead.Watch the trailer for Steinem's new Viceland series ""WOMAN"" below:Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
26,SPORTS,"Donald Trump Tends To Cheat During Golf, Oscar De La Hoya Says",Juliet Spies-Gans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-oscar-de-la-hoya-golf-course_us_572b470ae4b0bc9cb045c7f8,"Little Marco. Lyin' Ted. Now, Cheating Donald?",2016-05-05,Donald Trump hits out of the sand on the first hole of the Poppy Hills Golf Course during the second round of the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am in 2005.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For Oscar De La Hoya, one’s conduct on the golf course is indicative of his or her character off the links. And, unfortunately for the GOP, the fairway isn’t a flattering mirror for presumptive presidential nominee Donald J. Trump.Speaking in Las Vegas, the former boxing champion relayed a story from 2014, when he and his friends were about to tee off at Trump’s Los Angeles-based National Golf Club. Trump apparently approached the group and asked if he could join, to which they agreed. Trump then picked up a club, squared his shoulders and promptly began to cheat his way through the course, leaving De La Hoya and partners surprised and amused behind him.According to De La Hoya, Trump’s first shot landed in the water. The next went out of play. The third sliced back into the water. And the fourth was lost to the surrounding bushes.But the next thing the group knew, Trump was standing over a ball in prime location.“Donald, what he does is he tees off first so we go off to our balls, and what do we see but Donald Trump right in the middle of the fairway,"" De La Hoya explained. ""He said, 'Hey, look, I found my first ball.'""“We’re like, ‘OK, yeah.’ We’re cracking up, [but] not in front of his face,” he said.And on the game went. On the next hole, history seemed to repeat itself, as a ball that Trump hit into the bushes showed up right in the heart of the course, just about three feet from the hole.""‘And by the way, I'm picking it up,’"" De La Hoya remembered The Donald declaring. ""‘It's a gimme.’""It's not the first -- or the second, or the third -- time someone's accused Trump of lying his way down the fairway. But two years after they teed off, De La Hoya no longer seems to be laughing about the incident.For De La Hoya, in the wake of the ugly, volatile Republican primary season we just witnessed, a man who would cheat on his own course is surely a man whose presidential caliber and qualifications we should question.“[His course conduct] shows something about his character,” he said. “Golf is a gentleman’s sport. You don’t lie about your score, you don’t lie about moving your ball.""""It goes to show what we’re dealing with,” he said."
27,POLITICS,The GOP Would Probably Have A Better Chance Of Winning Without Trump,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-fundamentals_us_572bc573e4b016f37895415f,"Polls suggest he's underperforming compared to a ""generic"" Republican candidate.",2016-05-05,"Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump speaks in New York on May 3, 2016, following the Indiana primary.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572bc6d81300002900380b91.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If Donald Trump weren't actually the presumptive Republican nominee, the 2016 race would probably be shaping up to be pretty competitive, say those who predict election results for a living.As political scientist Julia Azari wrote earlier this week:Election forecasts based on what political scientists like to call the 'fundamentals' — the state of the economy, how long the incumbent party has been in office, and how popular the incumbent is — are usually pretty accurate. Second, polarization has emerged as a powerful force in American politics. With an electorate that’s pretty set in its party preferences, it’s not too hard to figure out what the vote might look like.Working in the Democrats' favor, President Barack Obama's job approval rating, which languished in the red for most of his second term, now looks as healthy as it did during his 2012 re-election, and views of the economy have modestly rebounded.On the other hand, voters may be more than ready for a change after sticking with one party for two terms, which would (theoretically) give the GOP an advantage.Attempts to model elections give these factors different weights. Economist David Rothschild, the founder of the forecasting site PredictWise, says a ""generic"" Republican candidate should have a 47 percent chance -- or just under even odds -- of winning the presidency. Another model, created by a team of political scientists, gives the GOP a more bullish 60 percent chance of winning the election.But 2016 is different, and Trump is anything but generic.Predictions based on fundamentals carry the assumption that both candidates are on a relatively even footing -- what political scientists John Sides and Lynn Vavreck liken to a game of tug-of-war in which ""both sides are pulling equally hard."" Yet while both the real estate mogul and Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton are historically unpopular, Trump is overwhelmingly so, with polls putting his unfavorability rating at an average 60 percent. “In terms of any domestic personality that we have measured, we’ve never seen an individual with a higher negative,” Democratic pollster Peter Hart said in March, describing Trump's image as ""exceptionally rancid.""Trump is also straining party unity in a way that Clinton doesn't seem to be. Partisan concerns may eventually win over Republican voters and political dignitaries, but Trump's nascent general election campaign has already inspired a wave of high-profile GOP holdouts to condemn him.House Speaker Paul Ryan said Thursday that he wasn't ready endorse Trump. The two most recent Republican presidents, George W. Bush and George H.W. Bush, have said they'll skip the Republican National Convention, as have previous GOP nominees Mitt Romney and John McCain.By contrast, Clinton has yet to sew up her primary or win over Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), but she's already won the backing of much of the Democratic establishment.""This was never the Democrats' race to win,"" Sides said in an email Tuesday. ""I think as of right now, Trump's negative favorables make him less likely to win than you'd expect given the fundamentals.""Other measures of the race, including horserace polls and prediction markets, back up that sentiment. PredictWise's Rothschild gives Trump just a 30 percent chance of winning the election. HuffPost Pollster, which includes all publicly available polling, shows Trump starting off 7 points behind Clinton nationally, and trailing her in a number of crucial states.  ""Although we remain convinced that Hillary Clinton is very vulnerable and would probably lose to most other Republicans, Donald Trump's historic unpopularity with wide swaths of the electorate - women, millennials, independents and Latinos - make him the initial November underdog,"" forecasters at the Cook Political Report said Thursday, explaining why their map shows swing states like Florida, Colorado and Virginia leaning blue. A recent George Washington University Battleground poll made it especially clear how the presidential race might be different if Trump weren't involved.The survey split voters into two groups: Half were asked to pick which of the two parties they trusted most to handle a range of issues, while the other half were asked specifically about Clinton and Trump.Voters gave Republicans a substantial lead over Democrats on jobs, taxes and the economy, and a smaller edge on foreign policy. Adding Trump's name to the mix immediately ceded that advantage.""The Republican Party has a strongly favorable political environment for winning the White House. If a mainstream Republican candidate were the presumptive nominee, the GOP would likely be in a strong position for a lot of wins, top to bottom, in November,"" pollsters Ed Goeas and Brian Nienaber, from the GOP polling and research firm The Tarrance Group, wrote when the survey was released.""However,"" they added, ""the party is facing the challenge of the possibility of an unconventional nominee who is likely to squander most of this favorable environment due to his temperament and rhetoric.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
28,POLITICS,Feds Tell North Carolina Governor That Anti-LGBT Law Violates Civil Rights Act,Ryan J.

Pat McCrory that the state's anti-LGBT legislation violates federal laws.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572a53341300001a013808b2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A North Carolina law that bans transgender individuals from using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity violates federal civil rights laws by discriminating against students and employees on the basis of sex, the Justice Department told Gov. Pat McCrory (R) on Wednesday.Vanita Gupta, the head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, wrote a letter that gives McCrory until Monday to confirm that “the State will not comply with or implement HB2,” according to The Charlotte Observer.Federal officials have previously said that states that fail to give transgender students full access are engaged in discriminatory activity. Last month, the federal appeals court in the 4th Circuit ruled in favor of a transgender high school student who is suing his school board because he was banned from the boys' bathroom.The state of North Carolina and McCrory have come under increased pressure from outside organizations as a result of the law, which was passed to prevent the city of Charlotte from establishing an anti-discrimination ordinance. The federal government says that the law violates both the rights of employees under the Civil Rights Act and the rights of students under Title IX, meaning that the state could lose out on millions of dollars in federal school funding.The law, Gupta wrote, ""is facially discriminatory against transgender employees on the basis of sex because it treats transgender employees, whose gender identity does not match their biological sex, as defined by HB2, differently from similarly situated non transgender employees."""
