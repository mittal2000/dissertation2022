But for Hillary Clinton, the event generated good news: Three wins in a row against her competitors, coupled with an increasing sense that come next fall, she will be a formidable opponent on the main debate stage.Clinton has long been a talented debater -- in 2008, she was consistently better than Barack Obama, though in the final analysis that superiority did not pay off at the ballot box. What she has demonstrated in the current election cycle is an even higher degree of fluidity in this most singular of political communication formats. Her performance in Saturday night's debate in New Hampshire should give pause to her would-be Republican rivals. This is a woman who knows how to debate.It's not just her command of the material or her ease in the spotlight that makes Hillary Clinton a solid debater. It is her apprehension of the particular requirements of this milieu. Too many candidates fail to perceive that debating is not the same as giving a speech, or fielding questions in a press conference, or interacting with voters in a town hall. Debates have their own demands, their own folkways. Although each event is distinct from the next, at bottom electoral debates function as a clearly defined television genre, a genre that necessitates certain behavior from its participants.Consider Clinton's ability to modulate her delivery over the course of the ABC debate. In this case, the candidates -- not to mention the audience -- were subjected to a program that clocked in at two and a half very long hours. As the minutes ticked by, Clinton displayed a range of performing modes: aggressive and amiable, serious and funny, scripted and spontaneous. She correctly intuited that no performer can stand on a stage for two and half hours without offering viewers some measure of variety: tempo changes, tonal shifts, gradations in the color palette.Compare this flexibility of approach with her two competitors on the stage, Bernie Sanders and Martin O'Malley. Except for rare moments, Sanders delivers everything in the same relentless honk, as though he has swallowed a loudspeaker. His debate demeanor is exactly the same as his demeanor in rallies, even though the context could not be more different. Because he so rarely fluctuates, Sanders gives the audience little reason to lean in and listen for the unexpected.O'Malley, over-caffeinated in this debate, came off as borderline obnoxious in his determination to be a player. Aggressiveness in debates is not in itself inappropriate, but too much aggression smacks of desperation. Both stylistically and rhetorically, O'Malley falls into a rut of predictability--over-relying, for instance, on anecdotes to illuminate abstractions. Every single person this man meets, apparently, embodies a political issue to be made hay of on the debate stage. And then there are the Republicans. With the notable exception of Marco Rubio, this year's crop of GOP debaters is an essentially one-dimensional field, at least in the presentational sense. Trump exudes bluster. Cruz exudes smarminess. Carson exudes narcolepsy. Bush exudes awkwardness. And so on. The Republican candidates, despite their larger numbers and more frequent debate appearances, are sorely lacking in the on-camera fluency that has become a Hillary Clinton hallmark. In the ABC debate, as the second segment kicked off, Clinton was missing in action, her lectern conspicuously empty when the questioning began. Suddenly, as Bernie Sanders was about to answer, Clinton materialized from the darkened wings, strode onstage to the audience's applause, leaned into her microphone with a grin, and said, ""Sorry."" It was a nice little human moment, not terribly important in the great scheme of things, but symbolic of Clinton's understanding of debates as live, unscripted events that should be taken seriously, but not too seriously.  The final line of her closing statement -- ""Thank you, good night, and may the force be with you"" -- showed that Clinton also understands the value of the scripted moment. This ability to embrace the two disparate halves of televised debates -- choreography and spontaneity -- is something few candidates understand, much less bother to master. With each debate, Hillary Clinton is showing voters that as a practitioner of the art, the force is most definitely with her."
1,POLITICS,Sanders Campaign Says DNC Will Restore Voter Data Access,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-dnc-data-access-will-be-restored_us_5674e6cde4b014efe0d5aca2,"MANCHESTER, New Hampshire, Dec 18 (Reuters) - The Democratic National Committee has agreed to restore voter data access to",2015-12-19,Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and the Democratic National Committee reached an agreement regarding the Democratic presidential candidate's access to a crucial voter database Friday. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5674ee40160000d400eb948c.jpeg?ops=crop_11_307_5749_3533%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Democratic National Committee agreed Friday night to reinstate Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) presidential campaign's access to its voter database, which had been suspended following a data breach.The DNC blocked Sanders' access to the data Friday morning, after Sanders campaign staffers wrongly accessed voter information from rival Hillary Clinton's campaign on Wednesday. Sanders' campaign claimed that the DNC ""capitulated"" as a deadline neared for a court hearing on a request for an emergency injunction that the Sanders campaign sought after suing the DNC in federal court Friday afternoon. Sanders' lawsuit sought the ""immediate restoration"" of the campaign's access to the database, arguing that the campaign would lose roughly $600,000 a day in donations without it. The campaign said in a statement that its access to the database should be restored by Saturday morning.“We are extremely pleased that the DNC has reversed its outrageous decision to take Sen. Sanders’ data,” Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver said in a statement. “Clearly, they were very concerned about their prospects in court. Now what we need to restore confidence in the DNC's ability to secure data is an independent audit that encompasses the DNC's record this entire campaign.""A person close to the situation said that the Sanders campaign would not be dropping its lawsuit against the DNC, despite the agreement.The DNC had demanded that Sanders' campaign prove it no longer possessed any data from Clinton's voter file before it restored Sanders' access to his campaign's own voter information. In a statement early Saturday, DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) said Sanders' campaign ""has now complied"" with the committee's request to provide the information it had requested.""Based on this information, we are restoring the Sanders campaign’s access to the voter file, but will continue to investigate to ensure that the data that was inappropriately accessed has been deleted and is no longer in possession of the Sanders campaign,"" Wasserman Schultz said. ""The Sanders campaign has agreed to fully cooperate with the continuing DNC investigation of this breach. The fact that data was accessed inappropriately is completely unacceptable, and the DNC expects each campaign to operate with integrity going forward with respect to the voter file.”Schultz added that the DNC would continue to work with the data vendor, NGP VAN, ""to ensure that a breach of this nature never, ever happens again and that our data is secure.”Clinton national press secretary Brian Fallon tweeted early Saturday that the campaign was ""pleased"" with the firm hired to conduct an independent investigation into the data breach. Lawyers for the Sanders campaign alleged in their lawsuit that the DNC “failed to implement reasonable data security measures,” which led to “the inadvertent disclosure” this week of the Clinton campaign's confidential voter information.But Clinton's campaign and the DNC told a different story. ""This was not an inadvertent glimpse into our data and it was not, as the Sanders campaign has described it, a mistake,"" Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said in a press call with reporters Friday afternoon. Audits of the NGP VAN program show that four accounts linked to Sanders made 24 separate efforts to save the Clinton data within the system and one effort to export the data to a spreadsheet. Clinton's press secretary tweeted after Sanders' suit was filed that ""if you are so proud of your grassroots organization, you should not need to resort to stealing campaign data."" The Sanders campaign fired its national data director, Josh Uretsky, earlier on Friday, and said it was considering disciplinary action against other staffers who may have been involved in the breach. Schultz defended the DNC's decision to suspend Sanders' database access, arguing that the move was an appropriate response to the agreement the campaigns had with the committee to not access one another's proprietary information. Clinton's campaign criticized Sanders for sending a fundraising email off of the breach, titled ""Urgent: DNC tipping the scales for Hillary Clinton,"" arguing that it was fanning the flames of the dispute to raise cash. Sanders' campaign manager, in turn, accused the DNC of ""actively attempting to undermine our campaign"" to help Clinton. Clinton, Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley are participating in the Democratic primary's third debate Saturday evening in New Hampshire.Also on HuffPost:"

Gerald Turner said in a statement, which heavily weighed into his and the Board of Trustees' decision not to participate in the so-called ""campus carry"" law.""The results were overwhelmingly in favor of SMU remaining weapons free when the law goes into effect,"" he said in a statement. ""More than two-thirds of students who responded to the Student Senate letter said they favored SMU remaining a weapons-free campus. In addition, faculty, staff and students supported SMU remaining weapons free by 10 to 1 in their online responses.""But public universities will be required to allow concealed handgun permit holders 21 and over to carry handguns when the law takes effect on Aug. 1, 2016. This falls on the 50th anniversary of one of the deadliest U.S. gun incidents on a campus when Charles Whitman killed 16 people by firing from a perch atop the University of Texas at Austin campus' clock tower.Private universities have been allowed to opt out and many of the biggest-named schools in the state have done so including Rice University and Texas Christian University.Critics have said it would be dangerous to have professors discussing grades with pistol-packing students, and that college youths and firearms could make for a deadly combination.Supporters of the law enacted by the Republican-controlled Texas legislature have said that schools would be safer by having more guns in more places, with the firearms held by those who have gone through the requirements needed for a concealed handgun permit.A University of Texas advisory committee said it faced widespread opposition to campus carry but has reluctantly recommended allowing handguns in classrooms when the law goes into effect, saying last week it cannot bar the firearms under the state measure.The University of Texas system is one of the nation's largest with an enrollment of more than 214,000.Governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, has said the law could prevent mass shootings because someone with a licensed concealed weapon could be on campus ready to confront a potential gunman.Eight states now have provisions allowing the carrying of concealed weapons on public postsecondary campuses, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, which tracks state laws.

3,POLITICS,Chief Justice Roberts Made 'Human Error' In Overlooking Conflict Of Interest,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chief-justice-roberts-conflict-interest_us_567430a5e4b06fa6887d0ee3,The head of the Supreme Court inadvertently participated in a case involving a company where he had a significant financial stake.,2015-12-19,"Justice Stephen Breyer was forced to sell off $33,000 worth of stock after a reporter discovered he inadvertently heard a case where he had a conflict of interest.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Earlier this year, a Supreme Court justice took action in a case where he had an unintended conflict of interest.Actually, that happened twice this year. One of the incidents involved Justice Stephen Breyer, and you might have heard about that, because it led the court to make public a letter explaining the ordeal.The other incident involved Chief Justice John Roberts, and you may not have heard about that one, because it just came to light this week. Back in October, Roberts participated in the consideration of an appeal involving Texas Instruments -- a company in which Roberts or one of his family members holds stock worth up to $250,000, according to his latest financial disclosure form.Fix the Court, a nonprofit that lobbies for more transparency and accountability at the high court, first discovered Roberts' oversight and published the findings on its website Friday.Kathleen Arberg, the court's public information officer, told Bloomberg that Roberts' mistake was no more than ""human error.""""There was a conflict that should have been caught but was not,"" she said.Under federal law, judges at all levels of the federal judiciary must ""disqualify"" themselves from a case when they have a financial interest in it. But Roberts somehow overlooked the fact that Texas Instruments -- best known for the ongoing supremacy of its outdated graphing calculators -- was one of several companies hoping to convince the court to take up their case, an environmental cleanup dispute.In the end, Roberts' conflict didn't matter because the court rejected the appeal outright in October, on the first day of the court's current term. No explanation was given for the rejection.Later that same month, Breyer was embroiled in a similar conflict in a big energy case, forcing him to sell off about $33,000 in stock after a reporter blew the whistle on it.""Chief Justice Roberts' oversight, as well as Justice Breyer’s similar mistake, demonstrate that the Supreme Court’s current system of self-checking for conflicts isn't working,"" wrote Gabe Roth, Fix the Court's executive director, on Friday. After Breyer's mishap, The National Law Journal reported that the justices have a seemingly arcane and non-uniform approach to avoiding potential conflicts, feeding the ""long-standing perception of the court as a collection of nine separate law offices that do things their own way, without much coordination among chambers.""""The conflict-checking process is an internal one carried out by the individual chambers,"" Arberg said at the time. ""The process does not include use of software.""It's not clear whether Roberts' and Breyer's oversights will usher in more modern mechanisms at the Supreme Court -- but the question could be answered soon. Later this month, Roberts will be issuing his year-end report on the federal judiciary.""I hope that the chief justice acknowledges some of these institutional shortcomings in his year-end report, and that he'll make some reforms and some changes that will make the process more open and will reduce the chances of this happening yet again,"" Roth told The Huffington Post.In the past, Roth has called for requiring justices to set up blind trusts in order to avoid financial recusals altogether, since recusals can lead to 4-4 ties in potentially game-changing controversies like last week's affirmative action case. (Justice Elena Kagan was absent from that hearing for a non-financial reason: her prior role as solicitor general in the Obama administration.)Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is widely expected to play a pivotal role in that case, once told members of Congress that such 4-4 ties ""mean that everybody's time is wasted."""

Axelrod even acknowledged that he could have ""worded"" his first tweet better.The DNC blocked the Sanders campaign’s access to its own voter database on Friday morning, after the DNC discovered that four accounts linked to the campaign wrongly tried to save and export the Clinton campaign’s data, which inhabits the same party-run system.The party restored that access early Saturday morning, but not before the Sanders campaign sued the DNC in federal court on Friday afternoon, seeking an injunction to immediately overturn the DNC’s initial denial of access, and claiming the party’s move would cost the campaign $600,000 a day in donations.Democracy for America, a 1 million-member online progressive group that endorsed Sanders on Thursday, had gathered 115,000 signatures for a petition to restore the Vermont senator's access to voter files by late Friday night. The petition was authored by Robert Reich, a popular liberal economist and former secretary of labor in the Bill Clinton administration.DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (Fla.) said in a statement that the party ended the suspension after the Sanders campaign “complied” with a request to prove it no longer had access to Clinton’s data. The statement also said the Sanders campaign had agreed to “fully cooperate with the continuing DNC investigation of this breach.”The Sanders campaign had already fired its national data director, Josh Uretsky, before suing the DNC, and has also said it might discipline other staffers linked to the breach.Meanwhile, a source close to the Sanders campaign told The Huffington Post that the lawsuit would proceed despite the restoration of access to the key data.The fact that a Democrat as prominent as Axelrod publicly accused the party of overreacting to real wrongdoing by Sanders’ staff in an attempt to help Clinton, however, speaks to a lack of confidence in the DNC under Wasserman-Schultz’s leadership that has been building for some time.The Democratic Party’s rank-and-file progressive activists -- and their preferred presidential candidates, Sanders, an independent, and Martin O’Malley, a former governor of Maryland -- maintain that Wasserman-Schultz rigged the primary process in favor of Clinton by allowing fewer debates than the party has hosted in the past and scheduling several of them on weekends when they will attract fewer viewers. The Sanders and O’Malley campaigns argue that they are at pains to compete fairly with Clinton, who has a major name-recognition advantage, without the opportunity to debate her frequently to the largest possible national television audience.The DNC has sanctioned just six Democratic presidential primary debates for the 2016 race, compared with 25 debates during the 2008 contest between Clinton and Obama.Three out of the six debates occurred or will occur on a Saturday or Sunday night, including one this Saturday at 8 pm ET in Manchester, New Hampshire.The Republican Party, by contrast, is hosting 12 presidential primary debates. Two of the debates planned will occur on weekend nights, and a third falls on a Friday. The GOP has yet to announce the date of one debate in March.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the number of GOP debates.Also on HuffPost:"

9,HEALTHY LIVING,Drinking Coffee Tied To Lower Risk Of Death,"Kathryn Doyle, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/health-benefits-of-coffee_us_567497ade4b06fa6887d8ae0,Drink up. ☕,2015-12-19,"Coffee (Or At Least, The Caffeine!) Can Help You Proofread Better ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ca3f4d170000b70056734e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"(Reuters Health) - In a 10-year U.S. study, people who drank coffee regularly were less likely to die of many causes, including heart disease and diabetes, than those who didn't drink coffee at all.The more coffee study participants consumed, the lower their risk of dying, and decaf drinkers showed a similar pattern.“Coffee contains numerous biologically active compounds, including phenolic acids, potassium, and caffeine,” said lead author Dr. Erikka Loftfield of the National Cancer Institute in Rockville, Maryland.Many studies have found that coffee consumption is associated with lower risk of overall and heart-related mortality, Loftfield told Reuters Health by email.The researchers used data from a previous study on 90,317 adults without cancer or history of cardiovascular disease who were followed from 1998 through 2009. They had reported their coffee intake, along with other dietary and health details, at the start of the study.By 2009, about 8,700 people had died. After accounting for other factors like smoking, the researchers found that coffee drinkers were less likely to have died during the study than nondrinkers.The risk of death was lowest for those who drank four to five cups of coffee per day. A similar association was seen among drinkers of decaffeinated coffee as well, according to the results in American Journal of Epidemiology.Coffee drinkers had a reduced risk of death from heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, pneumonia and influenza and suicide, but not cancer, the researchers found.“Although coffee drinking has also been inversely associated with incidence of certain cancers, like liver, in epidemiological studies, we did not observe an association between coffee and overall cancer mortality,” Loftfield said. “This may be because coffee reduces mortality risk for some cancers but not others.”People who consumed two to three cups of coffee per day had approximately an 18 percent lower risk death during follow-up compared to those who reported drinking no coffee, she said. Drinking up to five cups per day, or 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, is not associated with any long-term health risks, Loftfield added.Moderate caffeine intake, up to 200 milligrams per day, is even safe for pregnant women, according to a statement by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.“There is an accumulating number of studies of very high quality that show that people who drink more coffee tend to have better health outcomes,” said Dr. Marc J. Gunter of Imperial College London, who was not part of the new study.“Coffee drinking is correlated with other health behaviors,” and those who drink it regularly may have other healthy habits, like exercising and keeping to a healthier diet, though the researchers tried to account for those other factors, Gunter told Reuters Health.The study doesn't prove that coffee extends life.“You could argue that people who are already sick might not be drinking as much coffee,” Gunter said.But coffee may also have a direct effect on inflammation or cardiovascular health, he said.“It doesn’t seem to do you any harm, if you like drinking coffee then carry on,” Gunter said.Coffee can be part of a healthy, balanced lifestyle, and it may even do some good, though we can’t yet recommend than non-drinkers adopt the habit for health reasons, he said.SOURCE: bit.ly/1MhQhtl American Journal of Epidemiology, online November 27, 2015.Also on HuffPost:"
10,POLITICS,Totally Not Drunk New Mexico Governor Chastises Cops For Breaking Up Her Hotel Party,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/drunk-new-mexico-governor-cops_us_5674aae0e4b014efe0d5aaf0,"They were just eating pizza, you see.",2015-12-19,New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez (R) was caught on tape admonishing police for breaking up a gathering in her Santa Fe hotel room.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5674ac1f190000d30078a576.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez (R) was forced to apologize on Friday after audio surfaced of her admonishing police officers who tried to disband a hotel party she was attending.Three audio recordings obtained by several local media outlets feature staff at the El Dorado Hotel in Santa Fe, New Mexico, calling police in the early hours of Dec. 13 to ask them to kick noisy people off the hotel premises after complaints from other hotel guests.“We have guests that have been partying in their room,” Shelly Garcia at the El Dorado front desk told the Santa Fe police dispatcher. “They’ve been warned already and they are still not quieting down.”Garcia told police that the rowdy guests had been throwing bottles off their hotel room balcony.The hotel staff didn't know at the time that they were calling the cops on the governor, but they would soon find out.Martinez came to the front desk after three police officers showed up at the hotel.A slurry-sounding Martinez can be heard on the second recording repeatedly pestering Garcia to tell her who had complained -- or at least say what room they were in.“Oh you can tell the police, but they won’t tell you -- you won’t tell me?” Martinez said. “I’ll get it from the cops.”Martinez then gets on the phone with the police dispatcher, who also refuses to identify the people who complained.Listen to all three audio clips in order below, courtesy of the New Mexico Political Report.The third, and funniest recording, has Martinez speaking to an officer on the phone, incredulous that cops had been sent to the hotel. It's unclear at that point whether she is back in her room.“So we’re sitting in there, I’m the governor of the state of New Mexico, and we’re in there with my sister, who’s disabled, along with about six other people who are having pizza,” Martinez said.Told by the cop that there were reports of partying guests throwing bottles off the balcony, Martinez gave this creative denial:“I’m sorry. There’s no one on the balcony and there’s no one throwing bottles off the balcony,” she said. “And if there were, it was about six hours ago.”Then, still seemingly on the phone, Martinez turns to Sgt. Anthony Tapia, one of the officers at the hotel.“We are eating pizza, and drinking Cokes, and whoever was throwing bottles is not there, hasn’t been there for like six hours,” she tells the sergeant.It sounds as if Tapia then agrees to leave the hotel.Santa Fe police confirmed to the New Mexico Political Report that police spoke to Martinez, but did not enter the room. Nor did officers file a report on the incident, because no arrests were made.Martinez spokesman Chris Sanchez provided a statement to KRQE News 13, a CBS TV affiliate in Albuquerque, saying that Martinez “regrets the way this situation was handled by her and her staff and will further address that later today.”Sanchez said in the statement that Martinez had been attending her annual staff party in the El Dorado’s ballroom. She then went up to a staff member’s hotel room.“Unbeknownst to the Governor, there had been complaints about noise and someone throwing what turned out to be snowballs from the balcony of that room earlier in the night while the governor was in the ballroom,” Sanchez said. “While the Governor was in the hotel room, she was informed a complaint had been recently made, and was also made aware of the earlier complaints. At that time, the other guests left and the Governor went downstairs to the front desk to find out more information about the complaints and assure the hotel staff that those who had caused those issues had long ago left, and there was no longer a problem.”Sanchez also said Martinez “took a call from the Santa Fe police” while at the front desk, even though it's clear from the audio recordings that she insisted on speaking to the police -- not the other way around.Sanchez did not immediately respond to a request to clarify the discrepancy.The incident could prove to be a political liability for Martinez, a rising star in the Republican Party who was elected head of the Republican Governors Association in November. She has been talked about as a possible Republican vice presidential candidate.ProgressNow New Mexico sent out a press release advertising the incident to reporters on Friday afternoon.Also on HuffPost:"

The new movie sequel âStar Wars: The Force Awakensâ begins screening tonight. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4d715240000310097b44a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If the original Star Wars film had never happened, the entertainment industry would be in shambles, toys and games would be a minuscule industry, the publishing industry would in all likelihood be dead, many other industries from apparel to packaged goods would be struggling, and unemployment would be higher on a global scale.Here's why.George Lucas didn't just create a movie in 1977; he ushered in the modern day blockbuster era with a new, powerful playbook that all other entertainment executives and studios now follow. The original 1977 Star Wars film eventually grossed over $777 million worldwide and all of the previous six Star Wars films resulted in a total worldwide box office of just over $4 billion. But George Lucas didn't just create a film series, he created a new financial model that led to the modern day franchise. The retail value of the merchandise that Star Wars generated from the first six films is estimated to be five times its box office success, or roughly $20 billion. Until Star Wars, movies simply did not generate revenue beyond the box office, which is why 20th Century Fox allowed George Lucas to keep the rights to merchandise. And so the 1977 Star Wars changed the calculus that goes into green-light decisions. Giving the thumbs-up these days has as much to do with the downstream entertainment and merchandise potential than it does with a movie's initial box office projection. In many cases, the theatrical release is a break-even proposition due to heavy production and marketing expenses. So a number of films, perhaps even those such as The Hobbit, Pirates of the Caribbean, and Despicable Me might have never been approved had downstream revenue sources been nonexistent. I was at a recent studio meeting where one story idea was preferred over another because the potential for merchandise was greater. That's standard today. It wasn't before 1977.Consider even Toy Story 3; the film did about $1 billion in theaters worldwide, but its total retail take from all revenue sources was estimated to be roughly $10 billion. You gotta believe that this went into Disney's green-light decision.This all began in 1977 with Lucas who discovered, either through brilliance or dumb luck, that an engaging imaginary world, with sympathetic characters we wish to emulate via their aspirations and possessions, and an emotionally powerful and relatable storyline, can translate into enticing toys and video games to play, emotionally fulfilling soundtracks to listen to, colorful iconography to wear, engaging books to extend the narrative, school supplies to indicate our interests, cool room accessories to reshape our environments, and even tasty food to consume. This playbook is evident in nearly every Disney film since the 1989's The Little Mermaid that ignited the Disney Renaissance, and is further evident in Harry Potter, Transformers, Avengers, Jurassic World, The Hunger Games, The Lego Movie, Guardians of the Galaxy and many more. And so, had it not been for the 1977 Star Wars and the blockbuster playbook, the film industry would be struggling today. One study revealed that 5% of all films, most notably the blockbusters that successfully use the playbook, account for nearly all studio profits. The other 95% of films lose money or barely break-even. Said another way, most smaller films would not be made today were it not for blockbusters that fund them. Had it not been for Star Wars, 20th Century Fox might not exist today. Due to the success of the original 1977 film, the company's stock price zoomed from a low of $6 in June 1976 to roughly $27 after the film. Revenues jumped from $195 million in 1976 to $301 million in 1977. Subsequent films in the franchise helped stabilize the studio's growth. That's quite a gift in an environment where studios have a habit of going broke or getting absorbed. (Note: Disney has the rights to the seventh film onward). Had Star Wars and the blockbuster playbook never existed, Disney might be half its size...or less. There might have been no The Little Mermaid, no Mulan, and no The Lion King. It's hard to imagine that when Michael Eisner and Frank Wells joined The Walt Disney Company in 1984 that they did not have the Star Wars blockbuster playbook in mind. They saw a sleeping giant in Disney with great potential and a game plan created by Lucas. Had Star Wars and the blockbuster playbook never existed, the toy industry would be a much smaller industry. Tent pole films keep the toy industry alive. Avengers. Frozen. Pirates of the Caribbean. Batman. Spider-Man and more all use the playbook. So, too, does Lego, which achieved great success through licensing movie properties like Star Wars and more recently created a highly success film of its own, The Lego Movie. Hasbro recently won the license to the Disney Princess line, all of which are derived from film properties, and combined will result in hundreds of millions of dollars into Hasbro's coffers each year. None of which would exist without the playbook.Had Star Wars and the playbook never existed, the publishing industry would be all but dead. For years, book publishers have been struggling to simply stay afloat. ""Event films"" have tossed them a lifeline of ""Event Books"". Even entertainment vehicles that began as books, Harry Potter for example, benefitted greatly by the movies that sold more books. The comic book end of the publishing industry greatly benefited as studios began to search for enticing stories that could be the foundation for a blockbuster franchise, which in turn would generate demand for more comic books.Had Star Wars and the playbook never existed, the packaged goods industry and retailers would be smaller. A LIMA Study found that the global retail sales of all licensed entertainment/character-based merchandise from all sources was roughly $107 billion in 2014. With profit margins being razor thin in many businesses, a popular character on a cereal box can make the difference between success and failure. Had Star Wars and the playbook never existed, worldwide unemployment would be higher. The percentage of company revenue that goes to labor costs averages between 10% to 30% depending on the industry. Assuming a 15% ratio, and applying that to the LIMA's study $107 billion in revenue, gives us labor expenses of $16 billion each year that are a direct result of entertainment/character-based merchandise. That equates to hundreds of thousands of jobs around the world. And this does not take into account jobs created due to other downstream revenue sources such as movie entertainment/character-based parades, musicals, theme park rides and ancillary products and services from downstream suppliers. On a worldwide basis, the 1977 Star Wars and its playbook, in the hands of so many studios today, results in millions of jobs. Had the playbook never existed, the Great Recession might have been the Great Depression II. Yes...my numbers are rough ""guesstimates"", but the impact, whether you double the numbers or divide them by half is the same. The introduction of Star Wars and the blockbuster playbook, now used by all studios, has been immense. It's also possible that had George Lucas not hit on this game plan, that another creator would have stumbled upon it soon or later. But what if they did not? The world would be very different today. And now Star Wars: The Force Awakens, is about to debut. Box office projections are staggering, and some estimate that the film might eventually bring in nearly $2 billion at the worldwide box office. But that's a tip of the franchise iceberg. The massive consumer interest, created by an equally impressive Disney marketing machine, will lead to an immense retail onslaught of toys, video games, fast food, apparel, soundtracks, publishing, and themed products in many aisles at the supermarket. And the studio, theater owners, moviegoers, and employment statistics will be better for it. Much more so than had Star Wars never existed."

It's like the Beckhams always say as they climax in unison, ""Sex rules and I understand it!"" While I cannot account for the undoubtedly poetic and beautiful thoughts men have while doing what we were technically put on earth to do, here are some thoughts that I, an Experienced Sex Person™ have had during sex, or as I like to call it, ""Sure, I guess."" ________________________________________1. ""Why is it so dark / light / candle-lit / strobe lit?"" One of my favorite parts of sex is considering the amount of light that is in the room and how I will self-centeredly interpret this as a direct reflection on me as a Sex Person. How does one interpret light levels? What if a fog machine is introduced into the mix? Okay now I want a fog machine.2. ""Hahaha what do I do with my hands?"" As in group photos, it's hard to know what to do with your cute little opposable meat hooks. They get fidgety, or you can let them hang out on either side of you head doing this weird surrendering ""okay, fine, we're having sex"" thing, or you can let the other person link their meat hooks in yours. Or you can do what I do, which is accidentally hold someone in a vice-like handshake until neither of us climax.3. ""I appreciate your selflessness but you have been going down on me for an entire episode of Master Chef Jr."" Sometimes you need to know when to say when, particularly when I've been unresponsive for twenty minutes and am saying things like, ""You know what, I would have sex with Gordon Ramsay"" or ""But only if he was wearing that cool French hat the whole time.""4. ""Time is a mere construct that will one day consume us all."" Many women lay serious emphasis on how long a man can last in bed, but when it becomes clear that pillow talk about professional wrestling and depression medication is imminent, I like to ruminate on the fragility of time.If we're considering the time that the universe has existed, the time between me coming over to your place after performing standup comedy in what is essentially a parking lot and the Ming dynasty is miniscule, making the time that we're actually having sex infinitesimally smaller, invisible to the eye, ultimately meaningless.What is two minutes versus twelve, in the grand scheme of things? Besides a massive disappointment that I will regale in detail to my coven of lady-friends across the country three minutes after I leave your home? Drops in a barrel, my friend.I should watch Cosmos.5. ""Where is the cranberry juice and how long do I need to wait before I can drink it?"" My favorite part of sex is thinking about what I'm going to do once it's over. People are scary and full of germs and if someone gives me, a delicate flower, a UTI, I will have to kill myself. Thusly: Where's the cranberry juice at? Can I mix it into an alcoholic beverage to be cooler about it?By this time, I am consumed with thoughts of fruit juice and will not climax.6. ""PLEASE DO NOT MAKE EYE CONTACT WITH ME WHILE YOU ARE GOING DOWN ON ME DURING THE JUDGING PORTIONS OF MASTER CHEF JR."" THERE ARE CHILDREN IN THE ROOM.7. ""What arrangement of vowels is the most arousing?"" Entering coitus (that can't be a correct way to say it) with a fellow being often includes an unspoken contract to make a noise every once in awhile, usually vowels, though a clicking of the mouth and a series of hard consonants might do it for some couples. But what vowels are the most arousing? Here is a list of some that I have tried, usually after counting twenty seconds in my head so as not to seem too noisy:""Eeeeiiii"": sounds like you are seeing a ghost. Fun for October! ""Oooooo"": can be good, but can also sound like a mom finding handsoap on sale. ""Uuuuuo"": depends on how husky your voice is during execution. If you err too high, it gets firetruck-y. ""Iiiiiiiiiiiiiii"": sounds like you are about to begin a sentence. Go for it! Iiiiiiiiii am having a good time thank you!""8. ""Do I Uber Pool home?"" So you've already decided that you're not going to spend the night -- think of an excuse later. Do you take the fiscally responsible route and Uber Pool home with a pair of teenagers who just got off their shift at Baskin Robbins or do you treat yourself to a post-coital fuck chariot (regular Uber) being driven by an actor that would just love for you to check out his IMDB page? The choice is yours.9. ""Butt?"" Nothing like some light body part inventory to keep the mood going. Butt roll call. Where are they? Are they there? Ok good. I will think about touching one, but probably won't.10. ""My parents are texting me and I kind of want to answer?"" Do you like that, babe?11. ""Do I fake an orgasm or subject this poor soul to the reality that life is not fair?"" There is the kind option, and there is the option that is a little lazy but I will tell myself is holding a mirror to society.Sorry, pal.12. ""Hahahahaha oh no that is not my name, abort abort abort!"" I do not care who Kristen is but I am not her and you have been ejected from me like a trap door that opens in the floor except the trap door is my vagina and the floor is your penis, a big fan of Kristen's.Jamie is a comedian and writer whose baby teeth have been bronzed and loaded into a gun for when the moment is right. You can find her some of the time, most days at @hamburgerphone or jamieloftusisinnocent.com.________________________________________ More from Playboy.com: The Zero Masturbation Guide to More Sex 10 Ways Men Can Improve Their Sex Lives, According to Science  Inside New York's Underground Lap Dance Parties"

Known for her '80s and '90s R&B hits (""Make It Like It Was, ""Baby Come to Me,"" and ""A Whole New World"" with Peabo Bryson) the singer spent the past 15 years shying away from the music that made her famous. In that span of time she underwent brain surgery in 2009 and devoted herself to recording gospel music and being a pastor at two churches in Atlanta, GA alongside her husband (Pastor John Sidney Battle III, former NBA star with The Atlanta Hawks and Cleveland Cavaliers). But now after a self-imposed exile from secular music she is returning with a new album The Day Life Began, set for release on January 22, 2016. The album--recorded in an impressive five days--fuses her passions for R&B, gospel and jazz with songs such as the romance of ""Imperfect Love,"" the foot-stomping gospel of ""He's Alright"" and the jazzy ""A Night of Love."" Belle shared with us details on her newfound personal freedom enabling her return to R&B, early career struggles, the lesson Phyllis Hyman taught her, remaining relevant and why she proudly wears her gray hair.  Courtesy: Shanachie EntertainmentSouleo: After 15 years, why return to R&B music now?Regina Belle: When I went into gospel I didn't think it was respectful to still do R&B and gospel at the same time. It is not because of anything written or the church going off on me. It was more of Regina putting stipulations on herself and stating where she couldn't go because she got this calling in her life. But now I feel freer than I ever have in life. It feels like I am covering all aspects of what I do and operating in the gift God gave me. I believe God has freed me up to go in some other places because I am responsible and understand the power of music.Souleo: On the album you cover Phyllis Hyman's ""You Know How to Love Me."" Did you two share a personal relationship that inspired you to cover her song?  Regina Belle: I had a relationship with her. She is the reason for my lows [vocals] being what they are. She always emphasized the importance of having a great mid-range. But she said, 'If you go to highs and lows there ought to be a richness.' That is what sets you apart as a woman because that is unexpected. Even before that at Rutgers University in the late 1970s I was part of the African Student Congress. I was instrumental in getting her and Peabo Bryson to come to the college. Years later I would sing a duet with Peabo and be on stage with Phyllis. For me she was a wonderful person, energetic, charismatic and musically I have never heard a male or female whistle a solo. Souleo: What was that period of time like for you when you first came out in 1987 surrounded by the likes of Phyllis and Peabo?Regina Belle: When I first came out ""Show Me the Way"" was a hit record but I was also renting a house in Hackensack, NJ. I was making enough money strictly to pay the band. There were times when I had an eviction notice. Some days I had to come home, get off the tour bus, run in the house, change clothes and get in my car to go to New York and do background vocals for different artists. That's how I made my money to pay my bills. That continued for the first year of my career but I was committed to being this artist even if I couldn't do it the way I wanted to do it.Souleo: On your album with the song ""Open Your Eyes,"" you sing about some of the social injustices in the world today. What motivated you to record that song?Regina Belle: My assistant, Ivy Taylor told me that we needed to have something on the record that speaks to world issues. That's how that song came to be. You can roll off a number of incidents we are experiencing right now from ISIS to Black Lives Matter. We have multiple black men and women losing their lives simply for being. Who gets to say you don't get to live anymore? I don't understand that. And it doesn't stop there. Can we go into the school system and look at the imbalance of what our children are learning? We are functioning crazy people.   Souleo: Well somehow you seem to mange to stay sane in this 'crazy' world. What do you hope this album does for you now with a return to R&B?Regina Belle: I really want to get the word out that I am still relevant and have something to say. I want to be who I am now. I rock my gray hair because it is a blessing. I colored mine for many years but I've gotten compliments from so many men and women about being brave enough to sport the gray. I even wear it on the cover of my record. I am comfortable in my skin and I want listeners to feel that as well.**** The weekly column, On the ""A"" w/Souleo, covers the intersection of the arts, culture entertainment and philanthropy in Harlem and beyond and is written by Souleo, founder and president of event/media content production company Souleo Enterprises,LLC."
