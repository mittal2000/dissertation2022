Once you've sorted your Washingtons and Hamiltons stateside, check out a political science program abroad to add international knowledge to your think bank. Take advantage of our local study break suggestions because it's harder to blackmail you with foreign debauchery when you run for governor.Europe: Geneva, Switzerland The global fondue melting pot of Geneva is one of the world's most important cities financially and diplomatically. It's home to the second biggest United Nations office (after NYC) and many other intergovernmental agencies. Most poli-sci study-abroad programs focus on international relations (you know, because of the whole Geneva Convention thing). Known as the ""Capital of Peace,"" the Swiss army is equipped with tweezers, a toothpick, nail file and corkscrew that all fold away into a nice red pocket knife. You'll be safe.Study Break! Situated between two lakes and surrounded by dominating mountain ranges, Interlaken is the adventure sports capital of Europe. Whether you want to skydive, bungee jump, go canyoning, hang glide or scale a glacier, this is the spot for good, old-fashioned shit-your-pants adventure.Australia: Canberra, Australia One hundred years ago, presumably over a Fosters, an old convict from Sydney met with an old convict from Melbourne and pitted each of their respective colony's best boxing kangaroos against each other in a death match that would determine which city would be Australia's capital. When the match ended in a draw, a random location between the cities was chosen, and Canberra became the capital. Here, you can learn more about this and other fascinating Australian law-making processes in the Parliamentary Internship Program -- a program that lets you work directly with members of Australia's Parliament for a full semester of college credit.Study Break! Fraser Island in Queensland is the world's largest sand island. College students flock to party here with water so turquoise it looks photoshopped and sand so powdery white it would excite, confuse and ultimately disappoint Lindsay Lohan.Africa: Gabarone, Botswana Botswana has a stable, well-run government in a continent where corruption-free governance is tougher to find than blood diamonds. You'll study the politics of Botswana as well as Africa's role in world politics at a top African university.Study Break! The massive Okavango River Delta attracts a dense concentration of Africa's big mammals with its expansive crystal clear water channels. You can row around in dugout canoes and camp in the open among wildlife with no fences or cages. It's like a weekend camping at your local state park -- if your local state park had elephants, hippos, lions, hyenas, rhinos and zebras roaming freely.South America: Santiago, Chile The capital of one of the fastest growing economies in South America is home to a trio of universities with world-class political-science programs and was rated the second-best city for students in Latin America. With all courses in Spanish, you'll get plenty of practice in the language with the most native speakers outside of China.Study Break! Head way south to Torres Del Paine National Park in southern Patagonia. On the four-day trek you'll see jagged snow-capped peaks, avalanches crumbling down mountainsides, icebergs calving off glaciers and the iconic granite towers. The entire trek is near sea level, so there's no threat of altitude sickness.Asia: Hong Kong, China As East Asia lines itself up to be the center of the global economy, Hong Kong offers a unique perspective with its combination of Western and Eastern influences. You can get a study abroad twofer as many poli-sci programs emphasize bilingualism and biculturalism.Study Break! Take a ferry across to Macau, Asia's Las Vegas. Make a few short-term investments at a casino then blow your winnings at a club or titty bar. Remember to save a bit for the the Macau Tower bungee jump -- the highest in the world.Written By: Brian Biros"

Obama announced his nominations of White House counterterrorism adviser John Brennan to be the director of the Central Intelligence Agency and former Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel as Secretary of Defense. AFP PHOTO/Brendan SMIALOWSKI (Photo credit should read BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb0fc2000004e00fdacbc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As many prepare to visit the Washington, DC region for President Obama's second inauguration, I would like to share with you my top recommendations for presidential-themed visits. This list is very subjective; my passions and places I return to time and again to experience the inspiring history around us.1. The fabulous Smithsonian Museum Support Center in Suitland, Maryland is normally closed to the public, but several times a year, the Smithsonian Associates take tours that you can join. Check here for info. Virtually unheard of until Dan Brown's book The Lost Symbol, what can you see at this vast collections storage and conservation facility? Over 55 million objects, all fascinating, but one collection draws me back every time -- Teddy Roosevelt donated many collections to the Smithsonian. Part is publicly displayed, but those here can be seen, with their original accession cards still attached, exactly the way they were donated at the turn of the century.2. For dinner, dine in the gorgeous wine cellar at the elegantly refurbished Jefferson Hotel. The Jefferson's award-winning sommelier, Michael Scaffidi, formerly of the French Laundry, has meticulously recreated Thomas Jefferson's wine collection as documented at Monticello and through his travels -- including the Madeira used to toast the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Rumor has it that the Jefferson is a favorite spot of President Obama, but you didn't hear it from me.3. Visit another Jefferson collection at the Library of Congress. Thomas Jefferson offered to sell his personal library to the Library of Congress as a replacement for the loss when the British burned the U.S. collection during the war of 1812. In 1815, Congress purchased it for $23,950. Sadly, over two-thirds of Jefferson's personal collection was lost to fire in 1851. Since then, the Library has been painstakingly trying to recreate his original collection. You can view it by special appointment and there is no surer way to get a real sense of our third president than through his books -- and his wine.4. The Mount Vernon Estate and newly opened world-class museum is an obvious choice. You will experience the day to day life of our first president and of a large estate. Two small details, however, always intrigue me. Don't miss the portrait of Louis XVI, a major benefactor to the American Revolution, in the dining room, and right around the corner the Key to the Bastille presented to President Washington by General Lafayette to commemorate the French Revolution. The times they were a-changing. Don't miss Washington's Grist Mill down the road. 5. On a poignant note, of all my ""presidential"" visits the one item that touched me the most is at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History. Included in the many items in their Abraham Lincoln collections, is a small White House coffee cup. Abraham Lincoln placed this cup on a windowsill in the White House on his way out to Ford's Theater on the evening of April 14, 1865. A servant noticed and after he heard about the assassination, he saved the cup, which was later presented to Lincoln's son Robert Todd Lincoln. This small cup illustrates a very personal moment in time which still resonates today.6. Dinner again, at Bourbon Steak at the Four Seasons in Washington, DC. OK, this is a stretch for my theme, but they have the absolutely best french fries (remember Freedom Fries, does that make the connection?) and they say the steak is not bad either. Many foreign presidents and kings have stayed here and no doubt have had the french fries! 7. For your hotel, for presidential proximity, the only choice is the luxurious Hay Adams. Right across from the White House, no one is closer. Ask for a room overlooking the White House and your view will be much better than that you see on CNN newscasts. I promise! I hope you will come explore Washington during this inauguration or any time. History is alive here and you can see, taste and sense your past.Best wishes President Obama on the occasion of your second inauguration!"

For most of his childhood, he thought nothing of it. ""Honestly, who cares about how fat they were as a child?"" he says. But around the eighth grade he began to realize that he didn't look like everyone else. His male classmates' bodies were changing -- some were growing tall and lanky, others starting to develop broad shoulders. Biceps would bulge subtly beneath their t-shirts during gym class. They were starting to look more like men. Jeff was still just fat. ""I used to look at them, and then myself, and think, 'Why can't I be that lucky?'"" he remembers. No one was teasing him; he was just aware that the others looked somehow better. Definitely different. Or, rather, he was the one who looked different. ""It wasn't specifically about girls or even sports, and no one ever told me that I shouldn't look the way I did,"" he says. ""But I could sense that they were somehow better than I was."" For years, we've acknowledged the fact that no matter how much we try to temper it, girls face immense pressure to look a certain way -- from the media, Hollywood, and probably most of all each other -- a pressure that many would say starts early and doesn't ever really end. Research from NYU's Child Study Center has reported that girls become aware of the role physical appearance plays in how they're perceived, and received, by others as early as age nine, when their self-esteem peaks before plummeting drastically. But while girls are still three times more likely than boys to have a negative body image, according to the National Mental Health Information Center, those numbers are changing. More and more boys report being concerned with -- at times consumed with -- how they look. A recent study published in the journal Pediatrics reported that 40 percent of boys in middle and high school exercise regularly -- and 90 percent at least occasionally -- with the specific goal of bulking up. An earlier study in the British Journal of Health Psychology found that boys overwhelmingly reported feeling pressured to fit a certain physical ideal -- and that ideal was ""toned and muscular.""While it may seem that society's expectations for boys are simply catching up with those long held for girls, the fact is that old gender stereotypes play a significant role in what's happening here. Even as our acceptance of less rigid gender roles grows in other areas -- girls, we know, are just as good as, if not better than, boys in math, while boys who play with dolls don't necessarily grow up to be any less professionally aggressive than those who play with Matchbox cars -- the pressure on boys to be ""toned and muscular"" represents a return to a traditional notion of masculinity and what it means to be a man. The message: It's fine if boys want to go around wearing sparkly nail polish as kids, as long as they grow up to be big and strong and macho. It's hard to avoid, in a way. On a daily basis, boys are inundated with images of a beefy sort of masculinity, from the guys of the Jersey Shore, whose collective abs inspired their own line of workout DVDs, to Hollywood hunks like Channing Tatum, named by People magazine as the Sexiest Man Alive, and Taylor Lautner, who reportedly asked that his shirtless scenes be limited in the final installment of the Twilight series, so objectified had he begun to feel. During the recent holiday season, shirtless young men greeted shoppers entering some locations of Hollister, a clothing store that caters to teens and pre-teens. And while we've long blamed Barbie, let's face it: Ken's no slouch. Still, many boys report that the biggest pressure they feel comes from their coaches and peers --both male and female. After all, girls, too, are exposed to the many images of muscularity, and attention from girls (or lack thereof) helps fuel boys' desire to compete with one another for the title of biggest, strongest, best. But here's where it gets trickier for boys: Boys, more than girls, want to look good, but they don't want to admit it. That's because traditional notions of masculinity exclude any interests or traits that could be considered girlish -- things like grooming and dieting. And so while many pre-teen and teen girls take pride in openly preening -- whether that means painted nails and perfectly stick straight hair or a carefully cultivated disheveled Goth look -- boys have to ""play tough"" and stoic.   In sixth grade, Neil, a baseball player, began lifting weights once or twice a week, at the encouragement of his dad. But as his body began changing, he grew dependent not on the strength it gave him on the field, but on the compliments he got from others. Lifting for the physical benefits became second to lifting for an ego boost. And the bigger he got, the more he had to work out to keep eliciting reactions, even as he tried to downplay how much time he was putting in at the gym. He didn't want it to seem as if he wanted, needed, approval as much as he did. ""I began going to the gym before school, so I wouldn't run into anyone I knew,"" he says. ""I would go crazy if a day went by where I was kept from working out."" Even now, at 22, he still feels that if skips a few days at the gym, he's ""less of a man."" Outwardly, though, he works hard to project the image of the guy who can eat an entire pizza and look great. If an increasing awareness of body image encourages boys to eat well, go to the gym, and take better care of themselves, that's not a bad thing. Health club memberships are going up: Hooray. But when awareness turns to obsession, secrecy, or shame, the results can veer into the dangerous. According to the Pediatrics study, 38 percent of middle and high school boys use protein supplements and 6 percent admit to having experimented with steroids. Jeff, who eventually lost 40 pounds by going to the gym and eating less, maintains he was never anorexic or bulimic. But he admits there were many days he was really, really hungry. And the negative implications aren't just physical -- not at all. Too much emphasis on fostering masculinity and defining ""what makes the man"" has significant consequences. Gender typing is believed to impede emotional development and account for violent behavior in boys. Boys who don't feel pressured to adhere to gender roles, on the other hand, grow up to be more independent, more open-minded, and more sexually tolerant than their peers. They are more respectful of themselves, and of women. All of which to say: Working out isn't bad. A generation of boys becoming more aware of their bodies isn't bad. But working out in pursuit of an outdated notion of masculinity is most definitely not the direction in which we want our sons to be headed. We've just come too far.Peggy Drexler, Ph.D. is a research psychologist, Assistant Professor of Psychology at Weill Medical College, Cornell University and author of two books about modern families and the children they produce.

5,PARENTING,Flu Is Here: 5 Things Parents Must Do,"Claire McCarthy, M.D., Contributor
Pediatrician at Boston Children's Hospital, Assistant Professo...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/flu-advice-things-parents-must-do_us_5b9cb687e4b03a1dcc812269,What parents need to remember about hand sanitizers.,2013-01-12,"CHICAGO, IL - JANUARY 10: Dr. Anne Furey Schultz examines Alice Corcoran, who was experiencing flu-like symptoms, at Northwestern Memorial Hospital on January 10, 2013 in Chicago City. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention flu is widespread in 41 states. The CDC has reported 22,048 flu cases from Sept. 30 through December 31, 2012 compared with only 849 for the same period last year. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb6872100003300c53c10.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The flu is here, big time. According to the most recent influenza (flu) surveillance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC): * 29 states are reporting high activity, 16 are reporting moderate (up from 9 the week before) and 47 say that there are flu cases throughout the state. * Hospitalizations for flu have doubled since the week before  * 20 children have died from the flu this seasonIt's time to take this seriously -- and do these five things:1. Get flu shots -- for yourself and your children.It's not too late; while the flu shot can take a couple of weeks to really take effect, we've still got a couple of months of flu season ahead of us. It's not 100 percent effective, but hey, when it comes to the flu, any protection is good. For those of you who say you don't need it because you are healthy, I hope you understand that the flu doesn't discriminate; it's happy to infect anyone. Very young kids are more likely to get complications of the flu (as well as people with health problems and the very old), but anyone can get sick--and anyone can spread it to others. This isn't just about you.If your children are scared of needles, there is a nasal spray for people ages 2-49 who are healthy (and who don't have close contact with people with severely weakened immune systems). You, yourself, don't even have to get a needle.For those of you who say that the flu shot makes people sick... while side effects are possible after any vaccine (I felt a bit yucky the day after getting mine), the flu shot can't give you the flu because the virus in it is dead. And the one in the nasal spray is pretty darn close to dead. If people get sick after the flu shot, it's because they caught the flu before it could protect them, or they caught another virus.2. Wash everyone's hands.All the time. I mean it. You'd be surprised how much this can cut your risk of infection. Carry hand sanitizer and use it frequently, especially when you are out and about (you just don't know who touched that door handle before you). Plain old soap and water is fine too--but you need to use plenty of soap and wash for at least 20 seconds (which is about as long as it takes you to sing ""Happy Birthday"" twice or the alphabet song once).It's important to remember that most hand sanitizers contain alcohol (apparently some teenagers drink them to get drunk, go figure). If you've got a baby or toddler that always puts their hands in their mouth, you may want to err on the side of soap and water. Carrying wipes with you and using them frequently can help, too, although they may not kill all viruses.3. Stay away from sick people.I get that this isn't always easy or even possible. But during flu season, it's totally acceptable to ask about the health of everyone before accepting an invitation (or a playdate) and to tell people they aren't allowed to hold your baby. You are also excused for changing your seat on the train, or leaving a party early. It's always nice to be pleasant, and white lies can help (""Can't afford to miss any work--got a big project due"", or ""Doctor's orders, sorry""), but sometimes staying healthy is just more important than being polite.4. Be considerate of others.This is the flip side of the last one. Please, cover your coughs and sneezes (with a tissue or the inside of your elbow, not your hands). Don't go to work--or to the movies or parties or any other public place you don't absolutely need to go--if you are sick. Don't send your kid to school sick; I know you don't want them to get behind, and it messes up work to keep them home, but it's really unfair to infect other children.5. If you think you or your kids have the flu, call your doctor.Note that I said ""call."" These days, doctors' waiting rooms are one of the best places to catch or give the flu. But do check in with your doctor if you have symptoms of the flu (which include fever, cough, runny nose, sore throat, muscle aches, headache and sometimes vomiting or diarrhea), to see if you should get antiviral treatment.

The recent New York Times editorial ""Haiti's Long Road,"" has expressed this ""distance between hope and reality."" As the chairman of Libraries Without Borders, a humanitarian organization which has worked in Haiti since 2009, I reject this outlook and encourage people to recognize the earnest rebuilding efforts and successes Haitians have achieved since the earthquake. I have witnessed firsthand how well-designed projects with small- and medium-sized budgets can make a tremendous impact if the work is implemented with local actors on the ground. Immediately following the 2010 earthquake, Libraries Without Borders set up libraries in IDP camps that helped more than 500,000 Haitians to heal from trauma and move forward through reading and education. A year later, our organization brought Haitians BiblioTapTap, 4x4 mobile libraries that provided Haiti's most remote populations with a unique space for reading, discussion and cultural activities.After establishing the first digital library in the country, Libraries Without Borders, in partnership with the University of Haiti, is eagerly developing plans for the country's first ever central university library reserve, which will make available more than 500,000 books and academic resources to tens of thousands of Haitian students, researchers and professors. Haitians and their institutions -- not us -- requested that books and access to knowledge and culture be made priorities for reconstruction and they were right. Books not only restore a sense of normality for disaster victims, but they also inspire communities to heal and grow. Books connect people to people. They stimulate individuals' intellect and capacity to look forward. Of course, books are not a comprehensive solution -- they are simply an important vehicle for rebuilding Haiti. At the end of the day, the strength and resolve required to put Haiti on the path to robust reconstruction and sustainable development lies with the drivers of that vehicle: its own citizens. Now, more than ever, the international community must continue supporting Haitians and accompany them in the fight for their country's future."

In southern West Virginia, they often go to the coal mines. In the northern counties, they go to the oil and gas industry. But everywhere, corrections officers are fleeing the state's regional jails and prisons for better-paying jobs. With the 49th-lowest starting salary in the nation, it's no surprise. (AP Photo/Steve Helber)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2e397210000e700c7a2a0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Looking to cut a corrections budget that accounts for nearly a quarter of the state's general fund each year, Michigan lawmakers have reopened the door to privatizing state prisons.Prison systems constitute a major slice of state budgets across the country, prompting legislators to explore savings measures. Under legislation signed into law by Gov. Rick Snyder (R) this week, Michigan could send inmates to a troubled private prison or privatize other prisons as part of an effort to trim costs in the state's $1.9 billion corrections system.The legislation is a potential boon for the GEO Group, the nation's second-largest for-profit prison operator, which owns a now-vacant youth prison in rural Baldwin, Mich. Ever since the state canceled its contract with GEO in 2005, company executives have unsuccessfully tried to find inmates to fill the 1,725 empty prison beds. The company boosted its spending on political lobbying in Michigan more than fivefold last year.But the Baldwin prison has a checkered past. The state closed the facility, its only private prison, in 2005, following a series of audits and investigations that found high levels of assault, frequent staff vacancies and operating costs that exceeded those in comparable state prisons.Civil rights and criminal justice policy groups argue Michigan cannot ignore its troubled history with privatization. ""There's absolutely no reason to think that conditions will necessarily be better, or that problems like staff turnover will have been solved,"" said Barbara Levine, executive director of the Citizens Alliance on Prisons and Public Spending, a Michigan group that advocates for sentencing reform and reducing prison populations. ""There are a lot of lessons to be learned.""Michigan's experience with privatization offers a case study of the challenges many states have faced in outsourcing public safety to for-profit corporations: Cost savings often don't materialize, and lower wages lead to high rates of turnover, which critics say compromises safety. Private prison corporations such as the Florida-based GEO Group grew in the 1980s and '90s as state prison populations soared, and in more recent years as the federal government detained record numbers of undocumented immigrants. The companies have angled for growing shares of state and federal inmates, promising cost savings for governments struggling to balance budgets.But those savings have often proven illusory, according to a series of reports by federal and state auditors. State reports in Arizona, where nearly a quarter of the prison system is privatized, have found that medium-security private prisons cost more than state prisons when factoring in medical care and other costs. Studies on Florida's private prisons have also shown minimal cost savings, despite state requirements that private facilities must produce savings of more than 7 percent.Michigan state Sen. John Proos (R), who introduced the prisons bill last year, said the legislation is part of a broader effort to determine whether private contracting can bring down costs across the corrections system -- for food services, transportation and healthcare, in addition to outright management. Any contractor would be required to demonstrate a 10 percent cost savings.""This is a colossal industry in the state of Michigan that requires constant and diligent management,"" Proos said. ""The only way I could get my arms around the budget question of whether or not we are adequately using taxpayer dollars to provide those services was to ask the private sector to bid for those services.""Graphic courtesy of Michigan House Fiscal AgencyProos said the new law does not mandate that any prison be privatized, but he expects the state to begin asking private companies to submit proposals. A spokesman for the Michigan Department of Corrections did not respond to requests seeking comment.Earlier versions of the prison privatization bill focused specifically on authorizing the state to contract again with the GEO Group facility in Baldwin. The current legislation addresses prison privatization more broadly, and it contains language that allows the GEO facility to house Michigan adult prisoners.A GEO Group spokesman, Pablo Paez, wrote in an email that the company has a policy of not commenting on legislative matters or competitive bids.The Baldwin prison dates back to the late 1990s, when the state was looking for a private contractor to run a new prison for young males who were convicted of serious adult crimes. GEO, which was then called Wackenhut Corrections Corporation, opened the North Lake Correctional Facility in 1999, and problems started to emerge soon after.A local newspaper, The Grand Rapids Press, published an investigative series in 2000 that found high rates of serious incidents, such as assaults and attempted suicides, at the youth prison. Such incidents were occurring at three times the rate of the state's maximum-security prisons, according to the findings.A state audit in 2005 concluded that a high rate of staff turnover at the private facility was another serious problem, one that could ""negatively impact the safety and security"" of the prison, according to the audit.The audit also found that the prison wasn't saving the state any money, and that inmates could be transferred to existing state facilities at lower costs.Paez, the GEO spokesman, did not respond directly to questions about the operational issues at the Baldwin prison, saying only that the company is ""proud of its long-standing partnerships,"" including with government officials in Michigan. He wrote in an email that the prison is a ""state-of-the-art facility"" that abided by the state's contractual requirements and ""adhered to the highest national standards.""In 2005, then-Gov. Jennifer Granholm (D) vetoed additional funding for the youth facility, over protests of Republicans in the legislature, a decision that saved the state $18 million. GEO Group and local governments near the prison sued, claiming a breach of contract, but the courts sided with the state.After Michigan canceled the contract in 2005, GEO Group continued to try to fill the prison and recoup costs. Beginning in 2008, the company embarked on a $60 million plan to expand the prison from 500 beds to more than 1,700 -- even though there were no prisoners.The speculative prison expansion was needed to attract new government customers and achieve the proper ""economies of scale for our prospective clients,"" GEO chief executive George Zoley said in a 2008 investor conference call. The company tried marketing to the federal Bureau of Prisons to house criminal undocumented immigrants, but cost cutting at the bureau halted any new contracts.In 2010, California signed a deal with GEO to send more than 2,500 prisoners to the Michigan facility. But less than a year later, the state reversed course and asked for its inmates back -- part of a California prison realignment plan that brought out-of-state inmates home.Beginning in late 2011, legislators in Michigan started introducing bills that would allow the GEO Group to house state prisoners again. According to state lobbying records, the GEO Group spent nearly $30,000 lobbying during the first half of last year, a more than tenfold increase from the same time period a year before. One of the company's lobbyists is Rick Johnson, a former speaker of the Michigan House.Proos, the senator who sponsored the prison bill, said any past problems with the GEO Group in Michigan or other states should be taken into account when state officials evaluate any contract proposals.""You want to make sure that you're spending these tax dollars wisely, and for good benefit,"" he said. ""What we can't do is sit by and allow the costs to continue to skyrocket.""Staffing is the most expensive cost in any prison system, and wages tend to be lower at private prisons, where correctional officers are generally not unionized. Michigan lawmakers passed the prison privatization bill during a lame-duck legislative session last month, alongside right-to-work legislation that is expected to dampen the power of unions in the state. Critics of privatization argue the most substantial cost savings would come from broader reforms in sentencing and parole laws, not through lower-paid staff at a private facility. A report released by the Pew Center on the States last summer found that Michigan had the longest average length of stay for prisoners out of 34 states analyzed.The study found that significant numbers of non-violent offenders were being released after long sentences, and that Michigan could reduce its average daily prison population by 3,300 without any impact on public safety -- for an estimated savings of $92 million a year.Discussion around reopening the Baldwin prison also comes despite a decline in Michigan's prison population in recent years. Several state-owned prisons are also empty, prompting questions about why Michigan would need to reopen a private prison and force a major realignment of the system.Natalie Holbrook, a co-director of the Michigan criminal justice program at the American Friends Service Committee, a justice reform group, said the state should be thinking about long-term impacts when considering ways to trim costs.""You save money if you close down a prison, not open a new one,"" she said."

There are many more people who are completely unaware!Identity theft can happen to anyone and it could be relatively contained, like if someone gets one of your credit card numbers, or it could be much broader with longer-term consequences, like if someone is able to take most of your personal information, banking information, and access to credit. According to one study done in 2003, it took victims an average of 600 hours to fix problems created by identity theft.Identity theft is costly, time-consuming, and can dramatically lower your credit score, making life extremely difficult for many years while you work to correct the problem.So stopping identity theft as quickly as possible the best course of action.Reviewing creditor statements every month is a good way to keep regular tabs on your existing accounts but that won't alert you to new accounts opened in your name. A way to find those is to pull your credit reports regularly (at least twice a year, or perhaps even more frequently than that) and review them for information that does not belong to you. One of the resources you can use to get your free report is AnnualCreditReport.com.But what happens if you are the victim of identity theft? I recently spoke to Maxine Sweet, vice president of public education for Experian. She gave me some excellent advice, which I'm summarizing below. The best course of action is to get in touch with each of the three credit reporting agencies directly -- Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion -- and let them know that you have been a victim of fraud.Ask for a fraud alert to be placed on your credit report. A fraud alert is a 90-day alert placed on your report that warns lenders to verify your ID, giving you time to determine if you really are a victim, and automatically opts you out of pre-approved offers (such as those credit card offers you get in the mail). If you find that you are a victim, you need to file a police report and may choose to request an extended fraud victim statement that will remain on your credit report for seven years. (Don't worry, you will still be able to apply for loans and other forms of credit but you might be required to provide additional identification, so that lenders can make sure that you are you and not someone posing as you!)And, because you are a victim of fraud, you will also receive your credit report for free from each of the credit reporting agencies. (Don't use AnnualCreditReport.com -- save it for when you want to regularly check your credit throughout the year.) Once you get your credit reports, go over them carefully. Identify any issues that are incorrect. Some of these might be innocent errors because credit reporting companies update billions of accounts each month reported from many different lenders, but some of the errors might be indicators of identity theft. As well, watch for credit accounts that you do not recognize and, on credit accounts that you do recognize, watch for activity that wasn't from you.Identity theft is a costly, growing problem and it's not going away any time soon. The best defense is a good offense (by checking your credit regularly) but if you do become a victim of identity theft, get in touch with the credit reporting agencies and put a stop to it immediately!"

AIG said this included more than $7 billion of damages claims against Bank of America.AIG is not seeking monetary payments in the lawsuit, but wants the court to clarify that the New York-based insurer still has the right to sue issuers of securities in Maiden Lane II.New York Fed spokesman Jack Gutt declined to comment. Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson also declined to comment.The lawsuit is part of the fallout from AIG's $182.3 billion federal bailout that began in September 2008, and which was fully paid off last year.It came after AIG provoked a firestorm in Congress and from the American people this week as it mulled whether to sue the government that bailed it out by joining a $25 billion lawsuit by former Chief Executive Maurice ""Hank"" Greenberg. AIG eventually decided to stay out of that case.When it sued Bank of America in August 2011, AIG accused the Charlotte, North Carolina-based lender of misrepresenting the quality of more than $28 billion of securities it had bought from the bank and its Countrywide and Merrill Lynch units.An AIG spokesman said Friday's lawsuit ""narrowly seeks a declaration from the Court that a 2008 contract between AIG and ML II did not transfer to ML II AIG's right to sue Bank of America and other financial institutions for the billions of dollars of damages they caused AIG and its shareholders in connection with the fraudulent sale of RMBS to AIG.""According to Friday's complaint, Maiden Lane II paid $20.8 billion for a variety of subprime and other mortgage securities from AIG, barely half of their estimated $39.3 billion face value.The case is American International Group Inc et al v.

""To not include that part of history would have been irresponsible and inaccurate. We fully support [director] Kathryn Bigelow and [screenwriter] Mark Boal and stand behind this extraordinary movie.""Debate over Bigelow and Boal's intentions with the film has raged since late last year, when the film debuted for an Oscar qualifying run in New York and Los Angeles on Dec. 19. Those who have taken issue with ""Zero Dark Thirty"" include Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Carl Levin (D-Mich.), as well as Alex Gibney, an Oscar-winning filmmaker. In a blog written for The Huffington Post, Gibney took issue with some of the facts presented in ""Zero Dark Thirty,"" which asserts that key information about bin Laden's personal courier was offered up by a prisoner named Ammar, who was previously waterboard. The identity of bin Laden's courier led the CIA to the Al Qaeda leader's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. From Gibney's blog:""Ammar"" is a composite character likely modeled after two characters. The first was probably Hassan Ghul, who was interrogated by the CIA in 2004 with coercive techniques (NOT including waterboarding) and who did provide some details about Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti. But according to Senator Dianne Feinstein (who has access to all of the classified files) all of the vital information was provided prior to the rough stuff. The first clues about al-Kuwaiti were obtained in 2002 through the use of traditional interrogation methods.Sens. McCain, Feinstein and Levin took their outrage one step further, writing a letter to Sony and Pascal.""We believe the film is grossly inaccurate and misleading in its suggestion that torture resulted in information that led to the location of [Osama] bin Laden,"" they wrote in December.As recent as this week, the debate about whether ""Zero Dark Thirty"" is pro-torture remained in play. As TheWrap notes, Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences member David Clennon said he would not vote for the film in any Oscar category because of its content. ""Zero Dark Thirty"" scored a nomination for Best Picture, but Bigelow was snubbed in the Best Director category at the Academy Awards, putting the overall awards picture of the film in heavy doubt. (The 1989 film ""Driving Miss Daisy"" was the last Best Picture winner to capture the award without a corresponding Best Director nomination.) It's worth noting, however, that Boal did receive a nomination for Best Original Screenplay.“Torture is an appalling crime under any circumstances,” Clennon wrote in a blog post. ""'Zero' never acknowledges that torture is immoral and criminal. It does portray torture as getting results.”""We are outraged that any responsible member of the Academy would use their voting status in AMPAS as a platform to advance their own political agenda,"" Pascal said in her statement. ""This film should be judged free of partisanship. To punish an Artist's right of expression is abhorrent. This community, more than any other, should know how reprehensible that is. While we fully respect everyone’s right to express their opinion, this activity is really an affront to the Academy and artistic creative freedom.""For their part, Bigelow, Boal and Pascal haven't been thrown under the bus entirely. CIA director Michael Morell said in a statement that many tactics were used to find bin Laden.""[T]he truth is that multiple streams of intelligence led CIA analysts to conclude that bin Laden was hiding in Abbottabad,"" Morell said. ""Some came from detainees subjected to enhanced interrogation techniques, but there were many other sources as well.”""Zero Dark Thirty"" is out in theaters now.

The government is publishing its Energy White Paper, which is expected to send a strong message of support fof up to 20% of electricity to be produced by renewable energy. * Campaigners had been hoping that the Government would stick to previous aims of ensuring that 10% of energy would be generated by renewables by 2010 increasing to 20% by 2020, but Energy minister Brian Wilson said he was less interested in setting targets than in creating the conditions which will help renewable energy take an increasing share of the market. 14/7/03: It has been announced hundreds of offshore wind turbines are to be built around the coast of Britain after an 'historic' move by the Government to speed up the development of green power. Three areas of the country will be opened up to offshore wind farms which could be powering one in six households by the year 2010. Campaigners described the move as the dawn of a new clean energy era. *22*10/03: The Government gave the go-ahead for four new windfarms which will generate enough electricity to power 230,000 houses. The windfarms will be built up to four miles off the coast of Norfolk, Lincolnshire and Essex, with each site made up of 30 turbines. Energy Minister Stephen Timms said the new developments would help the Government reach its target of producing 10% of electricity from renewable sources by 2010. Windfarms could power up to one in six UK households under Government plans to boost renewable energy.The new windfarms will be built at Lynn, off the coast of Skegness; at Inner Dowsing, north of Skegness; off the coast of Cromer; and at Gunfleet Sands, off Clacton-on-Sea. *13/05/04: Cherished beauty spots are at risk from thousands of proposed new wind turbines, a new report claimed. Country Life magazine said Ramsbury in Wiltshire, Bradworthy in North Devon, Saddleworth Moor in Lancashire and Romney Marsh in Kent were among areas 'under threat' from the expansion of wind power. 20/09/04: Nearly three-quarters of the population agree that wind farms are necessary to help meet current and future energy needs in the UK, despite a vocal protest against their expansion, it is reported Monday September 20 2004. Now a campaign from the British Wind Energy Association will unite those in favour of wind farms and challenge myths that they are unpopular, noisy and a blot on the landscape.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb12ce3240000500096b10d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dear President Obama,Congratulations on your reelection and on walking Congress back from the ""fiscal cliff."" Good luck with the upcoming debt ceiling and budget cuts negotiations, too. Here are recommendations for your second term that will address energy-climate change challenges while expediting economic growth, spurring innovation, and creating more jobs. A Brookings Institution study found that ""newer 'cleantech' segments produced explosive job gains and the clean economy outperformed the nation during the recession..."" and that ""(m)edian wages in the clean economy... are 13 percent higher than median U.S. wages."" Energy companies are boasting about creating millions of jobs too.Thank you for including tax credits for renewable energy in the fiscal cliff deal, and for emphasizing clean energy and climate change in your recent interviews and your speech after winning reelection. I presume that means you plan to do more in energy and climate change, even though it will be controversial and require strong leadership. Go for it! You have the business community at your back, despite the oil and gas lobbyists' claims. In a recent study by the global consulting firm Accenture, ""more than nine in 10 business executives believe that sustainability is of significant importance to their business"" with 44 percent saying it is ""critical"" to their businesses. "" Jeff Immelt, the CEO of General Electric and a revered leader who headed up your Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, said on Charlie Rose recently that energy was a key issue for the country.So, plow forward with aggressive, ""Big Hairy Audacious Goals"" and engage the public on clean, affordable energy as aggressively as you campaigned for president. Be bold! Here are 10 ideas to help drive a clean energy economy:• Reduce the oil and gas industry ""subsidies"" and require investment: In exchange for these subsidies, require that the companies invest those funds in clean energy technologies. As President Reagan used to say, ""Trust but verify."" As a provision of qualifying for the subsidy, require that they provide evidence the funds went to clean fuels investments (current levels are insufficient).• Increase the investment in ARPA-E to drive innovation in clean energy. As Cheryl Martin, Ph.D. Deputy Director of ARPA-E said on my panel on ""The New Ecosystem of Innovation"" at the Greenbiz VERGE conference in November, government programs provide critical ""catalytic"" funding ""to remove a certain amount of technical risk... for things that are too early for it to make a corporate portfolio."" The funding can come from the savings in reduced oil and gas ""subsidies."" • Since the Republicans are not likely to eliminate the oil and gas subsidies, at least reduce them and create more public-private partnerships to develop 100 percent ""clean coal"" by 2020, such as those in the Energy Department's Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI), including with universities. Six such projects were announced but three withdrew, so at the very least replace the three projects that withdrew. We will not be getting off coal any time soon and we can solve this challenge with American ingenuity. • Demand that ""fracking"" be 100 percent environmentally sound by Dec. 31, 2013, with the EPA conducting random testing at sites. This is crucial, especially as natural gas becomes a larger percentage of our energy supply.• Establish national clean energy standards. As stated in The Center for American Progress report Taking Action on Climate Change:There's no mystery about what kind of federal policy reform is necessary to ensure that a significant percentage of America's energy is generated from low-carbon sources: passing a national clean energy standard that provides the long-term market signal needed by utilities and other industries to make big, job-creating capital investments in clean energy.You saw how the rise in fuel efficiency standards you demanded for automobiles drove innovations in that sector and created jobs. Look at what various states, and other countries like Germany and Denmark, are doing as well.• Put a price on carbon. It will create revenue without raising taxes and will drive innovation. As the VP of the Environmental Defense Fund (and your former energy and environment adviser on the National Economic Council) Nat Keohane wrote recently in Bloomberg Businessweek:The most scientifically sound and economically efficient policy step is to limit carbon pollution via a cap or tax. A $20-per-ton carbon price -- collected as a tax or by auctioning carbon allowances -- would raise on the order of $100 billion per year while creating powerful economic incentives to curb pollution in the most cost-effective manner (and develop new technologies to do so).• Develop more public-private partnerships to innovate clean energy solutions, such as the Department of Energy Small Business and Clean Energy Alliance Partnership, which provided funding to incubators of promising clean energy start-ups. We need to enable clean energy ingenuity and these start-ups won't survive without support. On my VERGE Innovation panel, Dr. Martin described the ""network"" ARPA-E has built with Duke Energy, the Electric Power Institute, and the Department of Defense, for example. • Adopt creative financing options for renewable energy innovation, such as Master Limited Partnerships recommended by one of your top picks to be Energy Secretary in Obama II, former Colorado Governor Bill Ritter on Platt's Energy Week, and in the recent NREL report. The NREL report talks about MLP's and other ""renewable power project securitization"" options, the Green Bank, and your home town of Chicago's Infrastructure Trust. It says securitization ""may offer the opportunity... for wide-scale and rapid investment."" • Get the Infrastructure Bank created, and make sure energy efficiency and renewable energy incentives and financing are included, as well as the smart grid. Maybe Vice President Biden can work his magic on this like he did with Senator McConnell on the fiscal cliff negotiations.• ""Remember the ladies,"" as Abigail Adams admonished her husband John Adams in 1776. Women are being woefully left behind in the energy/climate change economic boom, and it's unacceptable and ineffective. Women hold only 12 percent of the jobs in the industries of mining, quarrying, oil, and gas extraction; 15 percent of the green economy jobs; and 24 percent of STEM jobs overall. Don't you want your daughters to have a fair shot at these lucrative jobs?Today, many green economy jobs remain unfilled. There are nearly 500,000 green economy jobs posted on Monster.com, and more than half are going unfilled, as Susan Fallon, vice president of Government Solutions of Monster.com told me on Green Connections Radio™ a couple of weeks ago. Help fill the jobs-skills gap by incentivizing energy companies to hire women, and to contract with women-owned small businesses. Also, set and enforce higher set-asides for WOSBs in energy industry-related government contracts, holding agency leadership accountable for meeting them. To strengthen these initiatives, fix the inconsistencies in reporting on jobs and small businesses in energy and green economy companies, and include gender. Use your bully pulpit and your executive powers to sell the public on the urgency, drive energy innovation and distribute the related economic opportunities equitably. Ask the American people to stop punishing compromise and to start rewarding it instead. Seize the moment, Mr. President. You have a new Congress -- with a record number of women -- and you are unencumbered by election pressures. Inspire the new Congress to turn their backs on fear and embrace disruptive ideas. As Einstein said, ""We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them."" The decisions you make now will determine our energy and climate future for generations. How many more extreme, expensive and deadly storms will it take?Happy New Year.All the best,Joan Michelson"

We're barely two weeks into 2013, and Shell Oil has already made headlines by losing control of one of its Arctic drill rigs in the Gulf of Alaska. In what seems like a never-ending series of missteps by Shell as they look to drill in the Arctic Ocean, their drilling rig, the Kulluk, is -- at least temporarily -- safely anchored after it ran aground near Kodiak Island in Alaska. Interior Secretary Salazar has called for an expedited assessment of Shell's 2012 drilling season, including the grounding of the Kulluk and problems with Shell's other drilling rig, the Noble Discoverer. It's the right move, but we must ensure that this is a public, transparent process resulting in an objective and comprehensive review. What's more, we need to ensure that the assessment addresses a fundamental issue: whether it is possible to conduct safe and responsible Arctic drilling operations at this time. For now, we're calling on Secretary Salazar to suspend drilling activities in the Arctic seas.Shell's track record in 2012 -- and continuing into 2013 -- reveals a disturbing pattern and raises serious questions.The Kulluk's problems began when heavy seas snapped the towline while the rig was on its way to Seattle. Crews managed to re-establish the towline connecting the vessels, but the tugboat then experienced total engine failure, leaving both adrift in rough seas and high winds. I headed Alaska's environmental agency during the Exxon Valdez spill response, so I know how much harm can result from an industrial accident in Alaskan waters. When the Kulluk ran aground on an island near Kodiak, Alaska, photographs and video showed waves pounding the grounded drilling unit. According to Shell, the Kulluk had up to 150,000 gallons of diesel fuel, with approximately 12,000 gallons of lube oil and hydraulic fluid, on board. Fortunately, no spillage or serious injury to crew or responders has occurred so far, but Shell's failures jeopardized the lives of responders and threatened the surrounding environment. Imagine how different the result could have been if this same failure had taken place in the even more remote waters of the Arctic -- where Shell hopes to drill -- and not near a Coast Guard station on Kodiak Island.In less dramatic, albeit headline-worthy news, another of Shell's Arctic drillships, the Noble Discoverer, had troubles of its own. After being towed to Seward, Alaska, a Coast Guard inspection revealed serious issues with safety and pollution prevention equipment. The problems were so severe that the Discoverer failed to meet federal and international requirements. The Coast Guard cited the Discoverer for the deficiencies and ordered the ship to remain in port until it was brought back into compliance with regulations. As these ongoing incidents continue to unfold, they only add to other issues that arose during last summer's drilling operations -- including the near-grounding of the Discoverer near Dutch Harbor last July and a failed test of Shell's oil spill containment system that left the equipment ""crushed like a beer can,"" in the words of a government observer. The Arctic is an unforgiving environment, and oil companies like Shell are not in control. In light of Shell's demonstrated inability to carry out safe, responsible Arctic operations, the Interior Department's forthcoming assessment must be transparent, objective and comprehensive in scope -- including a rigorous investigation of Shell's drilling rig and oil spill response equipment failures. Shell's pattern of failures and near-misses demands an honest and thoughtful reconsideration of the company's plans for the Arctic. We need a time-out on Arctic drilling until we have improved our understanding of the region, protected important ecological and subsistence areas, and developed effective methods to clean up an oil spill in icy Arctic water.As we move deeper into 2013, let's resolve to make sure the good news for the ocean outweighs the bad. Whether it's in the icy waters of the Arctic -- crucial for ocean wildlife and the people who live on the coast of our Arctic seas -- or the waters near you, it's a good time to work for a safe and healthy year for our ocean."
