INTENSIVE CAREA spokeswoman for Britain's Health Protection Agency, where scientists analysing samples from the Qatari man found a match with the fatal Saudi case last weekend and reported their finding to the WHO, said on Saturday the 49-year-old was still in intensive care.He is being cared for at St Thomas's hospital, where he has been connected to an artificial lung to keep him alive.The WHO says there is so far no evidence to suggest the potentially fatal virus spreads easily from person to person. Scientists say the genetic makeup of the virus suggests it may have come from animals, possibly bats.The WHO has been collaborating with laboratories such as the HPA and another lab in the Netherlands which were responsible for the confirmation of new virus.""These laboratories have been working on the development of diagnostic reagents and protocols which can be provided to laboratories that are not in a position to develop their own, and these are now available,"" it said.But it stressed only patients who fulfilled strict criteria - including having severed respiratory syndrome, requiring hospitalisation, having been in Qatar or Saudi Arabia or in contact with a suspected or confirmed case, and having already been tested for pneumonia.""The essence is that this is not for people with coughs and colds,"" WHO spokesman Glenn Thomas told Reuters.Six suspected cases in Denmark last week turned out to be false alarms and Thomas said it was important ""to alleviate the burden of testing"" by ensuring health authorities and members of the public understand the criteria for a suspected case.

WSI is owned by security firm G4S, which was at the center of a dispute over security at this year's London Olympic Games.The move came after the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), an Energy Department agency, sent a letter on Friday to B&W Y-12 President Charles Spencer saying it had ""grave concerns"" about his company and WSI providing security at Y-12, the nation's only site for storing and processing weapons-grade uranium.The letter recommended that B&W terminate the subcontract with WSI and work with it to take over security operations after the July 28 break-in.The nun, Megan Rice, and two others cut perimeter fences to reach the outer wall of a building where enriched uranium was stored. The site was shut temporarily after the breach.An investigation by the Energy Department's inspector general last month found a security camera had been broken for about six months and was part of a backlog of repairs needed for security at the facility.The NNSA repeated on Saturday that Energy Secretary Steven Chu has said the incident was an important ""wake-up call"" for the entire nuclear complex.""The security of our nation's nuclear material is the Department's most important responsibility, and we have no tolerance for federal or contractor personnel who cannot or will not do their jobs,"" said NNSA spokesman Joshua McConaha.After the incident the NNSA's top security official and two other federal officials were reassigned. In addition, top officials at WSI were removed and officers associated with the break-in were fired, demoted, or suspended without pay.WSI's parent company, G4S, found itself the focus of a political and media storm this summer in Britain over outsourcing of security after it failed to provide enough guards for the Olympics.WSI did not immediately answer a request for comment about the ending of the contract.It seems few other jobs will be lost over the incident that brought new questions about the government's outsourcing of sensitive security operations.B&W said in a statement it will offer employment to all Y-12 security police officers and active union workers with WSI Oak Ridge.The NNSA and Department of Energy are engaged in reviews of security operations from the contractor, to the federal management, to the security model, McConaha said.The final review will begin after Chu asks outside observers to analyze current protection of nuclear materials and explore more options for protecting the sites.Chu received a classified review of the Y-12 incident earlier in the week by the department's health, safety, and security office."

As the New York Times' Steven Greenhouse recently reported,2012-09-29,"MIAMI GARDENS, FL - SEPTEMBER 16: NFL replacement referees discuss a play during a game between the Miami Dolphins and the Oakland Raiders at Sun Life Stadium on September 16, 2012 in Miami Gardens, Florida. (Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2d530210000e700c79e2e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Each week in Muscatine, Iowa, Tony Newton and his friends watch the trucks haul grain out of the local corn-processing plant, trying to gauge production at the Grain Processing Corp. The reason for their curiosity? Newton and his fellow labor union members are plant employees who've been locked out of their jobs for years in a labor dispute with the company. By seeing how many trucks leave the plant, the idled workers get a vague sense of how their replacements are faring.""Sometimes it’s a lot, sometimes it's a little,"" said Newton, a 26-year veteran at the plant and president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 86D. ""We see what they're putting out as far as production goes, and it can't be what it once was.""The lockout of NFL referees that ended this week may have felt like an eternity to football fans, particularly fans of the Green Bay Packers, which lost a game Monday night thanks to a blown call by replacement officials. But the referee work stoppage only ate into three weeks of the season before the league and the referees' union struck a deal. It's quite a different story in Muscatine, where Grain Processing Corp. employees from the union local have been locked out since August 2008. The Grain Processing Corp. stoppage is the longest ongoing lockout listed with the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, a government agency that mediates labor disputes. There is no definitive data on such stoppages. Another source, the Labor Department, only tracks stoppages involving at least 1,000 workers, so there may be lockouts longer than the one at Grain Processing.Four years is a brutally long time for a work stoppage that, at its outset, involved more than 300 employees. According to Newton, it continues to take a toll, at least on the roughly 100 workers who haven't left the area or taken new jobs at other companies as the lockout has grinded on.""I can't even count all the divorces that have happened, or people who've filed for bankruptcy,"" Newton, a 50-year-old married father of three, said. ""But on the other side, there are a lot of people who found better jobs.""These days, as union representation has dwindled to single-digits in the private sector, the American public seems to associate lockouts primarily with professional sports. In addition to the NFL referees, the league's players were locked out for four months during last year's pre-season after negotiations over a new contract broke down. NHL players, meanwhile, have been locked out since earlier this month as the players' union wrangles with owners over their contract, threatening the start of the hockey season. But lockouts are hardly just the domain of professional athletes. As the New York Times' Steven Greenhouse recently reported, the number of lockouts at American workplaces in general has surged in recent years, as even profitable employers try to gain an advantage in negotiations with workers in the weak economy. According to Bloomberg BNA, lockouts now account for a record percentage of work stoppages, and at least 17 companies locked out their workers in the U.S. in 2011.In one high-profile case, more than 1,000 workers represented by the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers union have been locked out of their jobs with sugar beet processor American Crystal Sugar for over a year in North Dakota, Iowa and Minnesota. Members of Congress have finally weighed in, trying to pressure the company to come to the table and put union members back to work.A lockout is different from a strike. In a lockout, the workers do not choose to walk off the job in protest. Instead, they are forced off the job by management as a negotiating tactic. Deprived of a paycheck, workers are more likely to scale back their demands or accept concessions at the bargaining table, management believes.Nelson Lichtenstein, a labor historian at the University of California, Santa Barbara, said lockouts have historically been used by companies going ""on the offensive,"" trying to leverage hard economic times or workplace trends.""In general, it's safe to say lockouts take place more frequently when management has the upper hand,"" Lichtenstein said. ""There are a lot of lockouts when wages or conditions are stagnant or going down and management thinks they can do more of that.""In the case of Muscatine, workers and management originally disagreed over several issues, but Newton said the differences have been whittled down primarily to pensions and outsourcing. By Newton's telling, Grain Processing Corp. wants to freeze employees' defined-benefit pensions and switch them to less attractive 401k-type plans, as employers have done throughout the country, including the NFL. In addition to resisting the savings plan switch, Newton said the union wants contract language requiring that the company prove it's economically necessary before outsourcing work. Newton said that workers will have no job security if the company has the freedom to outsource. He also argued that the lockout will limit the union's influence by driving out unionized workers. Company spokeswoman Janet Sichterman said that the company is working in good faith to reach a new contract, and that the issues left to resolve are ""not economic.""""When the employees return, they will continue to enjoy one of the best packages of pay and benefits in the region and in our industry,"" Sichterman said in an email. ""We remain committed to ending the dispute in a fair and equitable manner that will allow [the company] to operate in the most efficient and responsible way possible for a company operating in a volatile agricultural marketplace and global economy.""Many of the locked out workers found jobs at a nearby power plant, where their skills were in demand. Those who are left, Newton said, tend to be approaching retirement age and are fighting to maintain their pensions. As the local's president, Newton has been collecting a wage through the union, though he said it's not what he earned at the plant. He said he and his family are eager to get ""some normalcy"" back in their lives once the lockout is resolved. But unlike, say, the lockout of NFL referees, the union doesn't have mounting public scrutiny on its side. Now that the four-year mark has passed, the demonstrations aren't as frequent, and residents don't talk about the lockout like they used to. ""There's support, but over time it dwindles,"" Newton said. ""People move on with their lives and I don’t fault them. But there's still support.""The company and the union were last at the negotiating table in June.""I can empathize with anyone when I hear 'locked out,'"" Newton said, bringing up a phrase he'd heard often during the NFL dispute. ""I know exactly what they're going through. You have a lot of days where you're just in a mood where you're going through life. Some days you're happy, some days you're down. This is a chapter in our lives that we don’t want to define the book."" "
3,BUSINESS,$10 Billion in Hidden Costs: It's Time for Mutual Funds to Level the Playing Field,"Miles Livingston, Contributor

Sept. 19, 2011. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2d533200000e800000bec.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Mutual fund investors who choose no-load funds with low management fees no doubt think they are getting the best possible deal. But even investors in ""low cost"" funds get hit with hidden costs that amount to more than $10 billion annually. These expenses are generated whenever someone buys or sells shares. The problem is exacerbated when short-term traders move in and out of funds. Portfolio brokerage commissions and market impact costs associated with buying and selling shares are borne by all shareholders, which means short-term shareholders are getting a free ride -- or at least a cheap ride -- at the expense of long-term shareholders. Mutual fund companies are well aware that these hidden costs are being passed along to all shareholders, and if you read a prospectus carefully, you will find a disclaimer that reads something like this one from Vanguard's Equity Income Fund:""As money is shifted into and out of a fund by a shareholder engaging in frequent trading, a fund incurs costs for buying and selling securities, resulting in increased brokerage and administrative costs. These costs are borne by all [Vanguard's emphasis] fund shareholders, including long-term investors who do not generate the costs.""Several procedures have been used to reduce this wealth transfer from long-term investors to traders, including minimum holding periods, restrictions on the total number of transactions during a specific time frame and redemption fees for a specific time period after purchase. Restrictions on minimum holding periods or the number of transactions may reduce in-and-out trading, but only minimally. Redemption fees do nothing to reduce liquidity costs created by inflows, which are substantial. If none of these procedures are effective in reducing short-term trading costs, why do some mutual funds continue to use them? The reason appears to be the compensation pattern for management fees. Management fees are typically a proportion of assets under management, which gives fund managers an incentive to increase assets as much as possible. There is a clear conflict of interest between the incentives for increasing assets versus the goal of reducing liquidity costs imposed on long-term mutual fund investors. But it is time for mutual funds to put investors first and level the playing field by changing the way they charge shareholders for trading. Quite simply, a ""pay as you go"" system is needed so those who are trading in or out pay for the cost of their trades. In a research paper David Rakowski, associate professor of finance at the University of Southern Illinois, Carbondale, and I examine a new approach to correct the inequitable wealth transfer in mutual funds. Known as the Sacks Equalization Model (SEM), it is a patented algorithm developed by Seymour Sacks, a 50-year veteran of the securities industry. With SEM, the portfolio brokerage commissions for purchasing shares are added to the purchase price and the revenue generated by this mark up is returned to the general revenues of the fund. The price paid to redeeming investors is the net asset value minus brokerage costs incurred to sell some of the fund's securities. SEM can logically be extended to include the market impact costs of transactions caused by new inflows to the fund or redemptions. For example, if market impact costs and commissions result in a cost of $.04 to buy or sell a share with a net asset value of $10.00, a purchaser would pay $10.04 and a seller would receive $9.96. This approach is not only fair, but it can easily be adopted by any open-end mutual fund and it can improve fund performance by up to one percent. What's more, the algorithm can improve performance for long-term shareholders without unduly punishing short-term traders or dampening assets under management. It is a straightforward solution to a problem that has been with us as long as the mutual fund industry. The question now is: Will the industry step up? Miles Livingston, Ph. D., is Bank of America Professor of Finance at the University of Florida, Gainesville, and has studied mutual funds and the capital markets extensively."

Lawmakers from rural communities, as well as big mailers, have pushed back against plans to close facilities. A Postal Service plan to close thousands of post offices was derailed earlier this year.The Postal Service says it no longer handles enough mail to justify its current number of facilities and workers.In May, the mail agency said it would consolidate 140 of its 461 processing sites by February 2013, with more to follow. The plan involved shrinking the area where customers can expect mail to be delivered the next day, with the eventual expectation that delivery would slow further.The PRC opinion said that at most, that plan would save about $2 billion, slightly less than the Postal Service has projected. But if the move depleted mail volumes by driving advertisers and other mailers online, savings would be much lower, the PRC said.It also said the Postal Service focused on moving processing from small plants to large ones, but the PRC found that it could save more by looking at productivity rather than size.Using a model that would close the less productive sites first, the PRC said the USPS could save about $1.8 billion with minimal revenue loss and fewer changes to delivery times.The Postal Service said when it announced the plan that its second phase of closings and service changes would begin in early 2014. The PRC recommended the USPS use that time to study the initial changes and consider other cost-cutting options.A Postal Service spokeswoman said the agency is reviewing the advisory opinion."

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6b438250000cf0039b970.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Jim McCabe, Golfweek  MEDINAH, Ill. –- You want evidence that this was a Ryder Cup day unlike so many others? Start with the most experienced participant of them all, Phil Mickelson.Having made his Ryder Cup debut in 1995 when his playing partner, Keegan Bradley was 9, and his afternoon opponent, Rory McIlroy, was 6, Mickelson has known far more downs than ups. But Day 1 at Medinah CC surely was one of few highlights because for the first time in his Ryder Cup history, Mickelson won two matches in the same day.Hard to fathom, but it’s true, and what’s more, Mickelson stopped a couple of skids that sort of framed his heartache in this event.By teaming with Keegan Bradley for a 4 and 3 win in foursomes over Sergio Garcia and Luke Donald, Mickelson won his first team match since a Friday afternoon four-ball win with Anthony Kim in 2008. And it was his first foursomes triumph since teaming with David Toms on Saturday afternoon in 2004.Overall, Mickelson improved to 3-5-4 in foursomes. His four-ball mark improved to 6-8-2 with an afternoon triumph over Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell.• • •NOT THE USUAL STUFF FROM STALWARTS: At the other end of the spectrum were Lee Westwood and Tiger Woods.Westwood struggled in foursomes (with Francesco Molinari), but salvaged something of the day thanks to the utterly brilliant rookie, Nicolas Colsaerts. Thus, in his eighth Ryder Cup, Westwood still hasn’t lost twice in a day and he improved to 17-12-6 in his career.The same can’t be said for Woods, who got his wish, two matches with good friend Steve Stricker, but they were hardly the dependable anchors captain Davis Love had hoped for.Losing, 2 and 1, in foursomes, and 1-up in four-ball, Woods was beaten twice in a day for the third time in his Ryder Cup career. He also lost twice on Friday in 2002 and Friday in 2004.Stricker and Woods are now 2-3 in their Ryder Cup partnership. Woods’ Ryder Cup record fell to 13-16-2 and he’s now 1-7 in matches against Westwood.• • •SHORT AND VERY SWEET: The tidy, par-4 15th proved to be an American cash cow. All four foursomes teams in the morning made birdie to win the hole, while McDowell and Westwood each drove into water right. Of the three matches that got that far in the afternoon four-ball, the Americans won one, lost one, and halved one. For the day, the seven American teams that made it that far played it in 6-under.• • •TOUGH TIMES CONTINUE: Jim Furyk – who alongside Brandt Snedeker went to the 18th hole in foursomes and lost to Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell – is now 8-16-4 in his Ryder Cup career, 3-6-2 in foursomes. But here’s a head-shaker: Furyk hasn’t enjoyed a victory over one of the current European Ryder Cuppers since he beat Garcia in singles – in 1999! He’s a combined 1-17-3 against this crew in blue.• • •TEMPER THAT ENTHUSIASM: A scintillating performance in the afternoon four-ball could go a long way in building an American victory, but a word of caution. It was the first 3-1 American advantage in a session since the Friday afternoon four-balls in 1995 at Oak Hill CC. Of course, Europeans relish what happened that year, an unforgettable comeback in singles that led to a 14 1/2 - 13 1/2 victory.• • •DAY 1 IS GOOD TO AMERICANS: It’s the third consecutive Ryder Cup in which the Americans have led after Day 1. It was a hybrid of sorts in 2010, with just four matches because of rain, and the U.S. led, 2 1/2 - 1 1/2. They also led in Valhalla in 2008, 5 1/2 - 2 1/2.• • •GOOD START FOR NEW GUYS: Pretty brilliant day for the rookies. Three of the four Americans (Webb Simpson, Jason Dufner, Keegan Bradley) won their debut matches, while the only European rookie (Nicolas Colsaerts) not only won, he was a one-man machine, his nine birdies powering his team’s win over Woods and Stricker.• • •NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM: If long and unimaginative par 3s tickle your fancy, get on out here to Medinah CC. For the morning foursomes, the second was set up at 192 yards over water, the 13th at 249 over water, and the 17th at 184 over water. The eighth was 208, but it didn’t play over water. What a novelty.• • •SHORT SHOTS: Mickelson and Bradley handed Garcia his first-ever loss in foursomes. The Spaniard had been 8-0-1 . . . . . It was also the first-ever foursomes loss for the team of Garcia and Donald. They had been 4-0 . . . . . Bradley is Mickelson’s 14th Ryder Cup partner and his eighth in foursomes . . . . . Dustin Johnson won his first team match in the Ryder Cup, going out with Matt Kuchar for a four-ball triumph over Justin Rose and Martin Kaymer. Johnson lost all three team matches he played in 2010 . . . . . There was just one team bogey by either side in the afternoon four-ball, that by Mickelson and Bradley as they struggled at the par-4 sixth . . . . . Kaymer, once No. 1 in the world but now spiraling at 32nd, demonstrated that he’s still got some issues with his game. He sat out the foursomes and failed to make a birdie in his afternoon four-ball alongside Justin Rose . . . . . Westwood was the only other afternoon player to go without a birdie."

Throughout the first four games of the season, Buckeye fans have been forced to suffer through long stretches of frustration only to be followed by moments of brilliance and glimpses of the Ohio State Buckeye team that everyone is waiting to see under Coach Urban Meyer.Take for example last week's outing against UAB. The Buckeyes slogged through an entire half of mistake ridden football only to score two touchdowns in two minutes before heading to the locker room. Just as frustrating is the lack of answers as Meyer tells us that the three things that concern him most are, ""Offense, defense and the kicking game.""As the Buckeyes head to East Lansing to meet the Michigan State Spartans, the time has come for Ohio State to ""play angry"" as Meyer called it at the beginning of the season. Now that Michigan has proven to be, well, Michigan and Wisconsin finds themselves struggling the Ohio State/Michigan State Big Ten season opener could be the most important conference matchup of the season.Michigan State demonstrated weakness in their passing game against Notre Dame and again in their struggles against Eastern Michigan. And while the Buckeyes have had their problems in the secondary, they have also forced seven turnovers so far this season which could play big in this game.That leaves Michigan State running back Le'Veon Bell and it's not like Ohio State defensive coordinators Luke Fickell and Everett Withers haven't spent the week (if not the entire season) preparing for him. Their ability to not only contain Bell but wrap him up and bring him down (a problem in past games) will be a huge factor. Expect the Buckeyes to put all efforts into stopping the Spartan running attack forcing Michigan State quarterback Andrew Maxwell to prove himself in the air.If the Buckeyes can contain the Spartan ground game and force them to pass, it could be a long day for Michigan State.So far this season the Ohio State offense has centered on the play of quarterback Braxton Miller. He's provided a much needed spark and turned the game around on more than a few occasions. Miller's total carries has actually become a point of controversy among Buckeye fans. Concern over his 27 carries against UCF was met by criticism that he wasn't getting enough touches in games that followed. Whatever the case, stopping Miller will be a primary focus for the Michigan State defense.Miller won't be the only threat coming out of the backfield though as Carolos Hyde is expected to return from injury. For the first time this season, both Hyde and Jordan Hall will be available to handle ground duties. So far this season Michigan State has done well against the run and they will be looking to make Ohio State face a formable secondary.Early in the season the receivers were a problem for the Buckeyes but since then they have come of age. Michigan State will be the first true test as they face off one on one against an effective Spartan secondary. Go to man Devin Smith has already earned his spot on the highlight reels for the season with an amazing one-handed touchdown catch in the season opener against Miami. If he can establish confidence early, expect big things from him in this game.Corey ""Philly"" Brown is also establishing himself in the receiving corps and look for Jake Stoneburner in the short game as Meyer looks to move the ball around.Offensively for Ohio State, it may come down to the high pressure, quick attack passing game that the Buckeyes have been working to develop since Meyer came on board. Expect short, quick scoring drives in an attempt to put the Spartans on their heels early and keep them there.Although the Buckeyes have been up and down so far this season, they know the gravity and importance of this game. Practice time is over and Meyer has made it perfectly clear what is expected and what it will take for Ohio State to come out on top. If the Ohio State football team lives up to the potential Buckeye fans know it can produce, Michigan State is in trouble.Prediction: Ohio State 24, Michigan State 17.Jim Lodico is the owner of The Buckeye Blog where he share his incredibly biased analysis of the Ohio State Buckeyes and the college sporting world.

The crowd cheered louder as the ball crept toward the hole and when it stopped, Bradley’s caddie, Steven Hale, held his hands aloft, just inches apart, to signify its proximity to the hole.Mickelson’s magnificent wedge, and another European miscue, allowed the United States’ dream team of Bradley and Phil Mickelson to win its Saturday morning foursomes match, 7 and 6, tying the largest winning margin in a team match in Ryder Cup history.“We’ve had so much fun,” Mickelson said. “The crowd has provided so much energy, and it’s brought our best golf out.”The Americans’ clinching par was classic Mickelson. He pulled his tee shot well right of the fairway. Bradley pitched out, about 100 yards short of the green. Mickelson’s shot landed about 20 feet left of the hole, then slowly gained momentum as it rolled down a slope, nearly going in before stopping close. Westwood then left his 20-foot birdie putt about five feet short, and Donald missed the next one, to give the Americans a third consecutive victory. Their status as the stars of this week is all but ensured.“We just kept pushing and trying as hard as we could,” Donald said, “but they kept coming up with great shots.”Foursomes is not a format for low scores, but the Americans made six birdies in 12 holes Saturday. Just as importantly, they were bogey-free. The Europeans were 2 over.Mickelson is one match from having his first spotless Ryder Cup since his 1995 debut, when he went 3-0. The Americans’ successful duo will not play Saturday afternoon, as Davis Love III doesn’t want any of his charges playing five matches this week.Mickelson and Bradley didn’t lose a single hole Saturday. The Americans have played just 44 holes in three matches. They’ve won 18 of them, or 41 percent. They’ve only lost five holes, and trailed for only three of them.“It’s a little yin and yang,” Hale said. “Phil is so laid back and so loose, and Keegan can be very intense. I think they bring out a little bit of what each other needs to help find the balance.”They've closed all three matches in dramatic fashion. Bradley holed a 30-foot birdie putt to end their first match, a 4-and-3 foursomes win over Luke Donald and Sergio Garcia, who’d been a combined 14-0-1 in the format. Mickelson hit his tee shot to 3 feet on the par-3 17th to close out Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell, 2 and 1, in Friday afternoon four-balls.Mickelson and Bradley won the first two holes Saturday morning with conceded birdies. Westwood hit Europe’s first approach shot to 5 feet. Mickelson, who was about 50 yards ahead after Bradley’s big opening tee ball, hit his shot to 1 foot. Donald has built his resume on his stellar short game, but missed the birdie putt. Westwood hit his tee shot on the par-3 second hole into the water left of the green after Mickelson hit his tee shot to 15 feet.Bradley and Mickelson won Nos. 6 and 7 to go 4 up. Donald lipped out an 8-footer for par to halve the sixth. Mickelson reached the green in two shots on No. 7, while Europe had to lay up after Donald drove into the right trees. The Americans were 5 up at the turn after Bradley made an 8-foot birdie putt. He stared down the gallery behind the green, imploring them to cheer louder. Bradley reached the par-5 10th in two, allowing the team to win with a two-putt birdie. That was followed by the Americans’ incredible par on No. 12, just another highlight in a memorable week for America's star duo."

I still have primary custody of my daughter, which is the only reason I don't have to pay my ex support. We continue to split half the kids' unreimbursed medical expenses, and certain other kid-related items.The prospect of someone -- me -- who works full-time for a middle-class salary and has no family money, having to pay child support to someone who has so much family money that he doesn't work, wanders across the border of Ludicrousland and into Heinousville.But not everyone feels the way I do. One commenter on a blog post I wrote debating whether or not it is reasonable for a significantly poorer parent to pay a rich parent child support stated the following:""My personal opinion is that, if a parent cannot afford the expenses of having the child with them most of the time, then the child should be with the parent who *can* afford it.""Another commenter on the same post wrote this:""CS has nothing to do with rich, poor, male, or female. Your ex deserves child support.""  My problem with both of these comments is twofold. One, there is the presumption that the richer person is the better parent. Two, there is the complete disregard of the reality of the workforce and inherited wealth. Here are some doses of reality:- Men still out-earn women. On average, a woman earns 77 percent of a man's salary.- Women often stop working outside the home to raise children full-time, sometimes because the cost of childcare is so high that it makes more sense for them to stay home.- After a woman has been out of the workforce for awhile, it is very difficult to just jump back in and earn enough money to adequately provide for children without child support.- Being independently wealthy does not make someone a better parent. It just makes that parent able to afford more stuff.Note: None of the above should be interpreted as a blanket statement that women should not pay child support. Sometimes women significantly out-earn men and in those cases it is reasonable that a woman pay her ex-husband child support.What is the Purpose of Child Support?Child support was intended to help the less wealthy parent -- usually the mother -- provide adequate housing and necessities for the children. It is simply flat-out wrong to threaten a mother's ability to care for her children by denying her child support. And denying a woman custody, as the commenter suggested above, because she is the poorer parent feels like a move from the Romney-Ryan playbook.Those who suffer most from this Dickensian treatment of mothers are the children. Children deserve to live with both parents. Children deserve to reside in two homes with a relatively equitable standard of living. Children do not benefit from seeing one parent financially destroy their other parent.A Good Mother Without Money Can Lose Custody  When I did my clinical training to become a licensed therapist, I worked at a sliding-scale clinic. Often clients would not show up or be late to sessions. On the surface, these clients appeared spacey, lazy and uncommitted to therapy. They appeared to be people who made bad decisions.But in reality, as our supervisors pointed out, they were poor. Unlike us interns, with our nice cars and our fancy graduate degrees, these clients had been born into poverty. They didn't own cars. If they had jobs, they worked for minimum wage. Missing therapy appointments was not about incompetence, it was about scrambling for childcare and being at the mercy of public transportation and perhaps not even having the money for bus fare.The downside of privilege is that it distorts reality. It skews our perceptions of people unlike us and convinces us that we are superior. It strips us of compassion, civic duty and accountability. It has led to deregulation of banks, tax cuts for the wealthy, and cuts to social services. It is the very thing that has turned this country from a democracy into an oligarchy.We assume that non-custodial mothers are mentally ill drug addicts who cavort with pedophiles. Sometimes this is the case. But more often the non-custodial mother loses custody due to financial abuse: the inability to pay astronomical legal fees; the freezing of assets; the reduction or elimination of child support.   A quote from The Custody Project, an organization that provides grants to low-income women at risk of losing custody of their children:""A financial domino occurs when a mother, defending the custody or visitation of her children, can no longer provide the common necessities of life for her family because her finances have been economically stretched and simultaneously diminished to an unsustainable degree. And in this situation, under bad law, a good mother without money can lose custody.""But Back to My Original QuestionMore and more I hear about women who are fighting for custody or who have to fight for child support. The landscape of post-divorce life is changing and it is no longer a given that moms will get primary custody and adequate child support. A commenter on a recent Huffington Post article by Kristy Campbell said this:""Moms who stay at home and count on receiving child support and custody in the event of a divorce in this day and age are taking a risk and it's foolish to pretend otherwise.""  While I think using the word ""foolish"" is a bit harsh, I do agree that no divorcing woman should presume that child support will last. Child support is easily modifiable, either via an ex-husband's loss of employment or ability to hide funds, or evolution in family law.I still think the poorer parent should get child support. A parent's financial stress trickles down to the children, who feel the lack of funds both materially and psychologically.I don't think that a mother who's been out of the workforce for years should be expected to go out and find a job that will cover all the costs of raising children.But I want to know your thoughts: should the richer parent get custody?"
