In the video, posted to Twitter, a girl's excited shout of ""Look!"" becomes a high-pitched scream as the shells misfire into the crowd. A shell reportedly exploded in its casing, sending two or three rockets towards the crowd. The spectators were sitting ducks. ""There was not a lot of room in between groups of people, so when it happened no one could really get up and run,"" one attendee told NBC News.Show operators immediately cut off the rest of the show, and emergency services responded in less than a minute. Of the 20,000 spectators, nine were injured with ""minor abrasion burns.""Deputy Chief Greg Daly, who supervised the response, put a positive spin on the accident. ""This is Avon's 29th year of presenting one of the most spectacular fireworks displays in Colorado, and we have never had any failure in the production,"" he said. ""It is wonderful news that the injuries were very minor."""

He who could address this audience without a quailing sensation, has stronger nerves than I have. I do not remember ever to have appeared as a speaker before any assembly more shrinkingly, nor with greater distrust of my ability, than I do this day. A feeling has crept over me, quite unfavorable to the exercise of my limited powers of speech. The task before me is one which requires much previous thought and study for its proper performance. I know that apologies of this sort are generally considered flat and unmeaning. I trust, however, that mine will not be so considered. Should I seem at ease, my appearance would much misrepresent me.

(AP Photo/Dado Galdieri)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc15293240000320022a196.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"EL ALTO, Bolivia, July 4 (Reuters) - At a ""Witches Market"" in the Bolivian city of El Alto, dried llama fetuses said to bring good fortune hang outside tin shack stalls while healers read the future in coca leaves and call on ancient spirits to cure ills.When Pope Francis visits Bolivia next week, he will discover a nation that cherishes animal sacrifices and pagan worship and where relations between indigenous communities and the Roman Catholic Church have been strained. The country's first indigenous president, Evo Morales, has frequently clashed with the church.""I hope he comes with good intentions and not with the same thinking as in times past,"" said Luisa Quispe, 60, a self-described witch in El Alto, a satellite city perched above the capital La Paz.""We want respect for our culture.""Francis sets out on Sunday for Ecuador, Bolivia and Paraguay, three of South America's smallest and most impoverished nations, taking with him a message of solidarity for the downtrodden.Church leaders in Bolivia are calling the visit ""Reconciliation and Renewal."" The Argentina-born pontiff, the first Latin American pope, will seek to heal rifts between the country's indigenous people and the descendants of its Spanish colonial conquerors, who brought the Catholic faith to Bolivia. Three in every four people in the country of 10.6 million are Catholic.Quispe's stall is one of dozens along a dirt track where small stoves burning offerings to Pachamama, or Mother Earth, fill the air with scented smoke and women wearing bowler hats and colorful shawls line up for medicinal cures.A large white statue of Christ overlooking the urban sprawl towers high at the end of the street.""The pope is a European god not an Andean god,"" said one healer who withheld his name, fearing government reprisals. ""It seems absurd the government would spend so much money on the pope's visit.""DIVISIONSMorales, an Aymara Indian who has been in office since 2006, promised early in his presidency to govern in favor of the indigenous majority, marginalized by the ruling elite and left as poor farmers after Spain colonized the Andean nation.The former coca farmer called the Catholic Church ""an instrument of domination which brings injustice and inequality"" in 2008. A year later, Morales backed a constitutional referendum that stripped the Catholic Church of its official status and declared Bolivia a secular state.Father Jose Fuentes, who is helping organize the pope's visit, said Morales had stirred animosity toward the Catholic Church. He said the church respected local rites even if they had largely lost relevance when people converted to Christianity.The pope's tour is aimed at helping Bolivians overcome their differences, Fuentes said.""We need a meeting of indigenous people and descendants of the Spanish colonialists, between races, between those in Bolivia and those who have had to leave for the lack of justice,"" Fuentes said.Felix Cardenas, Bolivia's vice-minister for decolonization and a supporter of the 2009 constitutional changes, acknowledged the reforms had damaged the government's relations with conservative Catholic leaders.However, he cited the pope's concerns for the environment as a potential bridge. ""He seems like a Pope who wants to look after Mother Earth,"" Cardenas said. ""We hope the pope can be a positive example for the ultra conservative elements of the church here.""Chewing coca would be a strong signal the pope appreciated Bolivia's indigenous values, Cardenas said, referring to the widespread indigenous custom of chewing the leaves that are a mild stimulant, and the major ingredient of cocaine.The Vatican said this week the pope would decide for himself whether to chew the leaves in order to ward off altitude sickness when he lands at La Paz.On the capital's steep-sloped streets there is little evidence of the underlying tensions between the Church and indigenous people and even the government appears in a conciliatory mood.Buildings are being spruced up for the pope's arrival and banners welcoming him loom large across the city, while the government has designated two days of his visit public holidays.""We're going to the main road to see him come down from El Alto,"" said Janette Sarabia, 27, whose stall at another witches' market is stacked high with candles shaped as saints and skulls.

In this chain, a cause creates an effect that becomes the cause of a new effect and so on until the failure occurs. If multiple events can connect and lead to a failure, the opposite is true as well. There is a series of mental events that lead to massive success. Each event is the cause for another event. How can you apply this thinking to create authentic success, meaning and fulfillment in your life? Here's the countdown: Step 6  The final outcome that we want in our lives is to have great results. Nobody works for several years with the hope that maybe one day, if everything falls perfectly into place and if he's lucky enough he will fail. We all want results and success as the final effect. What is the cause of this effect?Step 5   Success is ensured through steady growth, exponential thinking, smart work, commitment and continuous learning. Overnight success usually requires many years of work. Nothing worthwhile is created quickly. What allows you to invest a lot of time and effort, to learn, to research and work hard until your dream becomes real?Step 4  The mental forces that allow you to continue learning, working and growing are inspiration, drive and motivation. Educational systems are constantly looking for new ways to motivate their students to learn various disciplines; organizations are investing millions of dollars in motivational programs for their employees. These approaches create only a momentary spike of motivation that rapidly goes away with the stimulus. Neither are sustainable because they lack the rock solid inner personal foundation. Step 3  The only way to trigger sustainable motivation, drive and inspiration is to live your life with a sense of purpose. When you make the decision to trust your heart, to live your values and to honor your passion, you will find purpose. If you don't live your values, if you ignore your passion and if you don't honor the intelligence of your heart, you will be empty and most likely experience a lot of emotional pain. You cannot create an inner conflict between the mind and the heart, you cannot lie to yourself about who you are, about your dreams and expect to live a fulfilled life. Step 2   The most straightforward and probably the only authentic way to find a sense of purpose is to put your life in the honest perspective. Honesty is critical.Step 1   You put your life in the honest (and correct) perspective by living the truth and by fully embracing reality. What is the most uncomfortable reality we all need to face in our lives? ""I will show you fear in a handful of dust"" - T.S. EliotOur time here on Earth is limited. The desert fathers in the remote monasteries of Egypt, the Greek orthodox monks on Mount Athos or the ancient shamans in Central America understood that death is the wisest and most reliable guide we have in life. Without sadness or worry, you must fully embrace the fact that you don't have time to doubt yourself, to live in self-pity, to postpone your dreams, to delay your life. You simply don't have time for a meaningless, empty existence. Without the awareness of our limited time on Earth, everything around us is trivial and ordinary. ""All you have to do is write one true sentence.  Write the truest sentence that you know"" - Ernest Hemingway, Nobel Prize Laureate Honesty without judgment is the secret door to peace and fulfillment, so think and feel the answer to these questions: 1. If your life ended in this moment, would you be fulfilled with how you have lived and what you have accomplished so far? 2. Would you be able to honestly say you have lived an authentic life? 3. What regrets do you have in life? 4. How can you live from now on without continuing to accumulate more and more regrets? Leave a comment and tell me. We're in this together. For hundreds of years humanity has tried to answer the question - ""is there life after death?"" For the first time in your life you now must honestly answer the question:  Do you really have a life before death? Your friend, Dr. DragosPS: Go do something extraordinary. Because it's never the extraordinary people who do the extraordinary. It's the ordinary people like you and me, who get up off their knees and decide to take the journey. Because they complete the journey, ordinary people become extraordinary."

When you make the decision to trust your heart, to live your values and to honor your passion, you will find purpose. If you don't live your values, if you ignore your passion and if you don't honor the intelligence of your heart, you will be empty and most likely experience a lot of emotional pain. You cannot create an inner conflict between the mind and the heart, you cannot lie to yourself about who you are, about your dreams and expect to live a fulfilled life. Step 2   The most straightforward and probably the only authentic way to find a sense of purpose is to put your life in the honest perspective. Honesty is critical.Step 1   You put your life in the honest (and correct) perspective by living the truth and by fully embracing reality. What is the most uncomfortable reality we all need to face in our lives? ""I will show you fear in a handful of dust"" - T.S. EliotOur time here on Earth is limited. The desert fathers in the remote monasteries of Egypt, the Greek orthodox monks on Mount Athos or the ancient shamans in Central America understood that death is the wisest and most reliable guide we have in life. Without sadness or worry, you must fully embrace the fact that you don't have time to doubt yourself, to live in self-pity, to postpone your dreams, to delay your life. You simply don't have time for a meaningless, empty existence. Without the awareness of our limited time on Earth, everything around us is trivial and ordinary. ""All you have to do is write one true sentence.  Write the truest sentence that you know"" - Ernest Hemingway, Nobel Prize Laureate Honesty without judgment is the secret door to peace and fulfillment, so think and feel the answer to these questions: 1. If your life ended in this moment, would you be fulfilled with how you have lived and what you have accomplished so far? 2. Would you be able to honestly say you have lived an authentic life? 3. What regrets do you have in life? 4. How can you live from now on without continuing to accumulate more and more regrets? Leave a comment and tell me. We're in this together. For hundreds of years humanity has tried to answer the question - ""is there life after death?"" For the first time in your life you now must honestly answer the question:  Do you really have a life before death? Your friend, Dr. DragosPS: Go do something extraordinary. Because it's never the extraordinary people who do the extraordinary. It's the ordinary people like you and me, who get up off their knees and decide to take the journey. Because they complete the journey, ordinary people become extraordinary."

15,MEDIA,Gawker Says Publishing Hulk Hogan's Sex Tape Was 'Good Journalism',Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gawker-hulk-hogan_n_7721190.html,,2015-07-03,"WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan attends the WWE 2K15 SummerSlam Confidential Panel at Club Nokia, on Saturday, August 16, 2014 in Los Angeles. (Photo by Todd Williamson/Invision for 2K/AP Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c8e62100000001c872ae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- When Gawker founder Nick Denton treks to St. Petersburg, Florida, to fight a $100 million lawsuit brought by Hulk Hogan, he’ll argue that the wrestler-turned-reality-star’s sex life is a newsworthy subject and that publishing a story and accompanying video clip of the act itself was, as he puts it, “good journalism.”It’s easy to get bogged down in the salaciousness of the content. But Denton and Gawker’s defense team want jurors to conclude that publishing an edited clip of the 30-minute sex tape falls in line with what journalists do every day: provide verifiable information in response to rumors and reveal contradictions related to a celebrity’s public claims. The wrestler’s sex life was a newsworthy subject, they argue, because Hogan spoke graphically in interviews and books about his prowess and because the existence of the sex tape was covered in the media, complete with grainy screen shots online. The Gawker-Hogan trial has been much anticipated in media circles given both the First Amendment issues and the reality show vibe. It was scheduled to begin in state court this coming Monday, until an appellate court ruled Thursday to postpone the trial over a legal technicality. A new start date hasn't yet been decided.In an interview with The Huffington Post, Denton said that ""this is a trial that we’re actually happy to go into.""""This is a story we’re happy to defend because, despite two-and-a-half years of digging and examination, nobody has yet pointed out any holes in the story,"" Denton said. ""There are no vulnerabilities in this story at all.”The long-running dispute, which has wound its way through state and federal courts, began on Oct. 4, 2012. Then-Gawker editor A.J. Daulerio published a story and a 1.5-minute clip of the tape, which was provided by a source. Daulerio's post noted previous coverage of the sex tape and suggested that the woman appearing in it was Heather Clem, wife of DJ Bubba the Love Sponge Clem, a friend of Hogan's who can be heard off camera early in the tape. Hogan had publicly claimed he didn’t know the woman in the tape, which was shot in 2006, and had said he wouldn’t have sex with Heather Clem.“Others used screenshots, and in that muck and confusion, lies and rumors and speculation proliferated,” Denton said. “We wrote a story which did not simply add another rumor to an already large pile of rumors, but actually sorted through those rumors and tried to establish some truth. That is the definition of good journalism, whatever you think about the subject matter.”Heather Dietrick, president and general counsel of Gawker Media, told HuffPost that the site “wouldn’t be doing our job if we’d gotten this tape and it shows something, reveals new information and clears up a lot of misinformation out there, if we would have just taken a pass on it.”Dietrick defended Gawker’s decision to show readers a video excerpt rather than merely telling them what was on the tape. As a result, she said, readers could make their own judgments based on the evidence. Dietrick said the principles behind publishing are “rooted in the First Amendment” and also “common sense.” “This particular case is about a few seconds of a sex tape,"" she added, ""but the principles that underlie it apply to almost every major news story that I can think of where there is some information that a celebrity or public figure doesn’t want to get out that becomes the basis of the story.”Hogan’s attorneys, however, argue that Gawker violated their client's right of privacy in publishing a tape of a sex act that they claim the wrestler didn't know was being filmed.Charles Harder, lead trial counsel for Hogan, whose real name is Terry Bollea, said in a recent statement that “the First Amendment does not allow a website to post secretly-filmed footage of nudity and sex, without the subject’s consent.”Despite Gawker's contention, Harder also argued that the site could have written about the sex tape, as other outlets did, without playing video from it. “The video is private,” Harder said. “It does not become a ‘public concern’ just because Gawker and Denton want to play it (and profit from it) or because it might appeal to the morbid curiosity of a segment of the population. If that were the test, then no one would have privacy, so long as certain people have an interest in watching them naked or having sex.” The question of privacy versus publication is still up to a jury to decide. The trial is expected to last about two weeks, with Denton, Daulerio and several other Gawker staffers taking the stand. Some journalists will surely flock to Florida to cover the proceedings, while others will be glued to the Courtroom View Network, which is making its gavel-to-gavel webcast available to members of the media.  Even preliminary judgments in the Gawker-Hogan case have received ample media attention this past week, from the decision to block the public and the press from viewing the tape when it is shown in court to Hogan's being permitted to wear only a plain bandana in the courtroom. Gawker also recently won a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit against the FBI related to its investigation into the tape, which could have ramifications on the trial. Dietrick said in a Thursday statement that the delay of the trial will allow Gawker ""to find out more about the three Hulk Hogan video recordings obtained by the FBI that appear highly relevant to the facts of the case."" She said one of the tapes provided that day by the FBI is ""incomplete"" and ""there is a serious irregularity in another tape.""The media company -- which includes sites like Deadspin, Jezebel and Gizmodo -- is understandably determined to get all the evidence possible, given that a financial settlement in the realm of what Hogan is seeking could financially cripple it. “It’s a $100 million lawsuit,” Denton  told The New York Times. “We don’t keep $100 million in the bank, no.”The upcoming trial has also troubled media law experts like Lynn Oberlander, general counsel for First Look Media and part of a media coalition that recently argued for full press access to the trial. “The biggest issue is that the jury could say, ‘No, this wasn’t newsworthy,’ and put the jury into the newsroom, making determinations after the fact what constitutes newsworthiness and what doesn’t constitute newsworthiness,"" Oberlander told HuffPost.Denton considers the Hogan tape not only newsworthy, but in keeping with Gawker’s long-running editorial ethos. “Why does this company exist?” he said. “This company exists because journalists kept secrets amongst themselves. They passed them around as gossip.”For instance, he noted that it had been widely known in Manhattan's media world that CNN anchor Anderson Cooper was gay and yet, unlike Gawker, other news organizations didn’t disclose that detail of the journalist’s life. “If we have information, if it's true and it's interesting and it's legal to put it out there, we will publish,"" Denton said. ""We have this catchphrase, ‘Whatever We Know, Whatever We Think,’ and we try to share that as much as we can.”"
16,POLITICS,'Vacation Is When I Have A 40-Hour Week',Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tom-perez-overtime_n_7721398.html,,2015-07-03,"BERLIN, GERMANY - OCTOBER 28: U.S. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez chats with trainees at the Siemens training facility on October 28, 2014 in Berlin, Germany. Secretary Perez visited the center to learn more about the German trainee system, in which manufacturers offer paid multi-year training programs to recent high school graduates. U.S. President Obama has expressed interest in adopting the system in the U.S., where thus far training is usually conducted at technical or community colleges, as a way enhance job growth, meet the job requirements of U.S. industry and make the U.S. economy more competitive. (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb903471f00002501258189.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Over the past year, as his agency was developing a rule to expand overtime pay to more Americans, Labor Secretary Tom Perez met a lot of workers who log brutal hours. Amid all the tales of double shifts and missed time with the kids, something that one man said to him stood out.""There was one worker who worked 60, 70 hours a week regularly,"" Perez recalled in an interview with The Huffington Post. ""I asked him, 'When was the last time you had a vacation?' He said, 'Vacation? Vacation is when I have a 40-hour week.'""By that definition, the man may be getting a lot more vacation next year.On Monday, the White House unveiled a major reform that should guarantee overtime coverage for salaried workers earning less than $50,440 per year. If the proposal goes into effect in 2016 as planned, an estimated 5 million new workers will be eligible for time-and-a-half pay, the standard overtime rate in the U.S., whenever they work more than 40 hours a week. Currently, those workers are entitled to nothing beyond their base salary for the extra hours they commit, so employers have an incentive to pile it on. But once those workers are guaranteed time-and-a-half, employers will be paying a premium for the extra labor. For many workers, the administration hopes, the change will translate into either a bigger paycheck or more free time.""I think the overtime rule could have the capacity to help millions of workers get back into the middle class,"" Perez said.Last year, the president tasked Perez's team with developing the rule through an executive order. Because of the money at stake, the Labor Department was pressured from all sides -- from business lobbies that didn't want the current rules changed at all, to progressive economists and Democrats who wanted them changed dramatically.In the end, the White House's proposal landed somewhere in the middle. Since 2004, due to reforms made under President George W. Bush, the annual pay threshold below which salaried workers are guaranteed overtime pay has been just $23,660. People who make more than that amount and whose jobs are classified in certain ways by their employers -- say, being labeled a manager -- have been excluded from overtime. Some Democrats wanted Obama to raise the cutoff as high as $69,000, thereby entitling the majority of salaried workers to time-and-a-half. The actual proposal at $50,440 didn't go that far, but it is still significantly more aggressive than many had expected. The White House wanted the threshold to be equal to the 40th percentile of earnings for salaried Americans. When you look at the job duties performed by people near that line, Perez said, they tend to actually have managerial responsibilities, as opposed to being managers in name only. Perez said he believes the proposal strikes a fair balance.""We wanted to get back to what the basic intent of the Fair Labor Standards Act was,"" he said, referring to the law that established overtime pay during the Great Depression. ""The fundamental concern we had was that the 2004 rule ... really worked great for employers and was a disaster for workers. We needed to rebalance that.""Rep. Mark Takano (D-Calif.) was among the congressional Democrats pressing the White House to go big. Takano spearheaded a letter to the administration from progressive House lawmakers urging a cutoff of $69,000. Though the actual proposal is more modest, Takano said he was ""very pleased"" with what the White House decided on.""I would say what [Obama] has done is very bold. He is more than doubling the level of eligibility,"" Takano told HuffPost. ""That's not a small step. It's a big step.""Retailers agree it's a big step, and since they'll be affected more than most, they're continuing to campaign against the change. They will have ample more opportunity, given the 60-day public comment period before the proposal can be finalized. In a statement Thursday, the National Retail Federation, a trade lobby, said store managers would lose their independence and be forced to watch the clock.""We think managers are professionals who should be able to make their own decisions. This plan isn’t about expanding the middle class -- it’s about turning salaried professionals into clock-watchers,"" said David French, the group's chief lobbyist.Perez said he has met retail managers who would have already asked for overtime pay, had they not feared the repercussions. ""There are workers now who are scared to stand up for their rights, including managers,"" Perez said. ""People think managers have leverage. Well, some do and some don't. 'If I speak up,' I was told repeatedly, 'I might get fired.' They need us to speak for them. That, to me, is an important function of government."" "

So whether you're looking for the best burger or a place to sink your teeth into some authentic Mexican food with a side of tequila, look no further this Fourth of July if you're in Dallas and consider Dugg Burger or Lazaranda Modern Kitchen & Tequila. Even better, do it with the top down in the cool little 2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata.Roadsters never go out of style and the 2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata brand of roadster is a well loved and fine tuned machine. This year too, the Mazda folks added the 25th Anniversary Edition trim and there were some minor changes to the base Sport convertible trim with a cloth top versus vinyl from years past.It's a tiny car, but it gave me a big smile as a scooted around the curves and turns, it just feels good as takes the road with precision and great handling no matter the situation.The 2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata seats two and comes in four trims: Base Sport, Club, Grand Touring and the 25th Anniversary Edition. For this year's new 25th Anniversary Edition you get better leather inside, 17-inch wheels and the added Premium and Suspension packages standard.Under the hood the 2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata offers a 2.0-liter inline four-cylinder engine with 167 horsepower on the manual and 158 horsepower on the automatic with 140-pound-feet of torque. If you opt for a sport it comes with a manual that is only five-speed, but the three higher trims will give you a six-speed manual transmission. Rear-wheel drive and all the trims also have a shift paddle option or, the base trim can be had for a little more money with a six-speed manual transmission. While a bit snug that is part of the reality of a roadster and while tight it was still a comfortable fit, I felt like I was in a rocket getting ready to take off. And taking off is exactly what you will want to do for the Fourth so begin by discovering one of Dallas's best burgers at Dugg Burger where you will find a simple menu, but not a simple taste. Dugg Burger is located in Dallas' Lakewood area. These guys have created the perfect burger concept where the juicy style burger, complete with organic meat, is served inside a tasty bun. Even better, you get to choose your own fixings while the burger master digs out the bun and replaces it with your chosen ingredients. Turning the world of burgers upside down, Dugg Burger opened earlier this year and was founded by Jeff Braunstein, Martin  Hennessy, Scott Spence and Jeremy Samson, four burger-loving restaurant industry veterans who collectively boast over 70 years of experience.A revolutionary burger concept indeed, Dugg Burger combines simplicity with innovation and the name appropriately comes from the unique process of digging out the top portion of the bun so as to reverse the burger-building process. ""Dallas is a burger town. People aren't even going to walk in the door if you don't have a great burger,"" says Braunstein. ""Guests have been loving our burger because our dug out bun lets them taste more of the meat and toppings. This process also allows us to provide a high quality, customized burger -- done quickly. We believe that was something missing here in Dallas."" For toppings - well that is simple since you can choose from the ""Dugg Dozen"" toppings or take a chance on the day's rotating Lucky 13 topping, a surprise every day.What is not a surprise however, the Dugg Burger philosophy, which emphasizes guest customization while keeping pace with a faster moving style of foodie. Of course for Mexican food lovers who want some tequila to wash it down, check out Lazaranda Modern Kitchen & Tequila, offering a classic and contemporary Mexican cuisine meaning a meal Texans will love with a modern Mexico-style flare. Lazaranda is actually the first U.S. venture of veteran Mexican restaurateurs Mario Letayf and Antonio Marquez. ""We are proud to bring Dallas the food we serve in our restaurants in Mexico and that I prepare in my home. We invite you to enjoy and live Mexico,"" says Chef Marquez, whose 30-year career has brought him from Paris to Los Angeles, back to his native Mexico, and now to Texas.""'Authentic' is a word that is frequently used,"" adds Letayf, who has owned and managed restaurants in Mexico for 20 years. ""Since Lazaranda serves the contemporary cuisine of Mexico. Lazaranda is truly the authentic restaurant that many others claim to be.""In keeping with a great kitchen and menu, Chef Marquez has a number of culinary degrees to bring to the Lazaranda kitchen from both Le Pot au Feu and the prestigious Le Cordon Bleu. Must-try menu items include the ceviche, one of the most versatile dishes of Mexican cuisine. Lazaranda offers a specialty section of ceviche with a variety of flavor combos or there is also the specialty dish called Chamorro, which is slow-roasted pork shank cooked in barbecue pits, wood-fired ovens or even in holes in the ground, where charcoal and hot stones serve as low-temperature ovens served with baked black or pinto beans.What word will you come away with after a meal at Lazaranda Modern Kitchen & Tequila, definitely authentic and the Tequila bar is worth a visit even if you aren't hungry.So power up and get behind the 2015 Mazda Miata, did I mention it's 21 miles to the gallon in the city and 28 miles per gallon on the highway at a cost of $32,935 for the 2015 Mazda MX-5 Miata Grand Touring and can opt for a power or do-it-yourself convertible top too. I particularly liked the power convertible top since all you have to do is push a button and pull a lever then wait a minute and everything happens like magic up and down. No matter what your preference this holiday weekend for food and fun, do it with the wind in your hair and celebrate the Fourth of July in style."

But while American political figures officially declared their independence on July 4, 1776, winning it was another matter. And that came on a hot day in June, instead of a cold day in December.There's nothing wrong with your textbooks, of course. Emboldened by George Washington's ability to maneuver the British out of Boston thanks to positioning his artillery at Dorchester Heights, America's 2nd Continental Congress did declare their independence in Philadelphia. It's all grandly captured in David McCullough's book 1776 as well.But what the texts often forget, but McCullough doesn't, is what happened to the Americans after Independence Day. Washington suffered his worst defeat, at the Battle of Long Island. 1776 continues to be a year to forget, as Americans lose Ft. Washington and other key outposts. The army is in full retreat, and it looks bleak.But while wins at Trenton (the famous attack on the Hessians after Christmas) and against a rear guard at Princeton give Americans a little hope, it's dashed the following year at the Battles of Brandywine and Germantown. The British capture the American capital at Philadelphia in 1777. Many in politics want Washington replaced, by either Charles Lee or Horatio Gates.While the British enjoy the homes and comforts of the City of Brotherly Love, Washington and his men suffer outside the town at Valley Forge. But they don't just suffer. They train with Lafayette and Von Steuben in the snow, while the British take it easy, and the King's officers party away. By contrast, the American officers share the miserable conditions with their men.The next test takes place on June 28 of 1778 at Monmouth Court House (a battle reenacted every year), as the British march across New Jersey. Washington hits General Henry Clinton's army in broad daylight, out in the open. This will be no holiday ambush, or hitting a small portion of a force. It means attacking British regulars at their full strength.General Lee, who dislikes the plan, leads it poorly and produces a disorganized retreat. Washington relieves him of command on the spot, and organizes a rally. ""Mad Anthony"" Wayne, General Stirling, and Henry Knox's artillery, the goats of Germantown, are ready to withstand an attack by General Charles Cornwallis.The result is spectacular. Washington's men stop Cornwallis' attack cold, a combination of snipers and stiff resolve (and heroic stories like the legendary Molly Pitcher). While America's cannon rake the enemy, the British guns are off on their timing. As temperatures climb to well over 100 degrees, Washington's order for his men to leave their coats behind is brilliant. The ""by-the-book British"" keep the heavy items, and lose hundreds more than the Americans to heat stroke. And it's clear who has been hard at work, practicing over the winter. Americans lose fewer soldiers in the pitched battle, and hold their ground, as the British leave the region for New York City.But there's a final piece that Monmouth battle archaeologists discovered, as seen on the History Channel's Battlefield Detectives. They found, arguably for the first time, buttons issued with a simple pair of words: U.S. No longer would we see ourselves as New Yorkers first, or North Carolinians first, or Rhode Islanders first. We would be THE United States of America. And that's a spirit the British could never beat. We're still united, and can't be divided.  John A.

The actor had sent out an image of the boy, who has autism, as part of a series of tweets challenging a new California law that eliminates personal-belief exemptions for childhood immunizations. The mother of Alex Echols asked Carrey to remove the photo of her son, noting that he had not been given permission to use it. The picture, which has since been removed, was attached to a tweet that read, ""A trillion dollars buys a lot of expert opinions. Will it buy you? TOXIN FREE VACCINES, A REASONABLE REQUEST!"" It was included among several images of distraught children with autism.The scientific consensus, based on multiple studies, is that the vaccines distributed in the United States do not cause autism. Moreover, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that thimerosal, the specific compound that Carrey argues can lead to autism, was removed from childhood vaccines more than a decade ago, except for some flu vaccines.Alex's aunt, Elizabeth Welch, posted a screenshot of Carrey's tweet on Instagram. In the caption, she said that her nephew does have autism but was diagnosed before receiving any vaccinations.Carrey is not the only anti-vaccine celebrity. Most notably, there's his former girlfriend, Jenny McCarthy, whose son has autism. "

An old poster tells me why I signed on:In the entire grand poster field of World War II memory, full of hope and promise -- even swagger and boasting -- this poster stands out as a unique call to duty.We are not winning here -- there is not even a promise of victory. Instead, ancestral ghosts are in formation for review. Is this still a beginning, or is it maybe a last hurrah for America? The spirit-soldiers are as stone-faced and grim as the winters at Valley Forge and the mountain fastness of the Wachtung had made them.These are not the soldiers of victory -- these are the soldiers who will fight no matter what it comes to -- to the bitter end. These are the men who made this country.Parading before them are the men now marching to the same dread uncertainty, in another war where American existence itself is in doubt. In the bitter winter of 1943, Rommel laid on a terrible defeat of American forces in Tunisia, 52 Soviet divisions were destroyed in the third battle of Kharkov, and convoys HX-229 and SC-122 lost 22 ships to U-boats. It was a grim March for the Allied cause.So America's soldiers pass in review, from light into shadow, into fate's storm. Yet the Continental veterans are bathed in storm light, the kind you see in a lightning strike, or a moment's crack in dark clouds.The GI's faces are turned -- a grimness highlighted by absolute anonymity. What does this mean? The message is this: We Americans are all in, and all in this together, and it is no longer about us anymore as individuals, but about us all together. We fight together; we sacrifice together; we live or die together.Thus the motto is most important of all: Americans will always fight for liberty.A poster about existence chooses its words carefully, and chooses them well. This is not a struggle for ""freedom"" -- it is a struggle for liberty. But liberty has the same Latin root as the Anglo-Saxon frēodōm. So what is the difference?The usage of liberty has taken a distinct path in modernity. For example, while we say we give a people freedom, or even ""liberate"" them, we cannot give them liberty. Liberty is a self-made state of political realization that must be self-proclaimed, fought for, and won. It is the opposite state of being, say, the passive recipient of American altruism, like in Operation Enduring Freedom or Iraqi Freedom.Moreover, as George Orwell so archly reasoned in his guide to Newspeak, even in the all-grinding tyranny of 1984 you could still say: ""The dog is free of fleas."" Free is a loose, generic, individual, and even momentary state of mind and being.Liberty, in contrast, is the living embodiment of the collective oath of a people -- and will ever be thus. So when the poster invokes liberty, it is speaking directly to the survival of Americans: Americans who can survive only by living in liberty.Would that I could say, this July 4, that I am the citizen of such a nation!To the contrary, I see a nation committed to the defense of tyrannies that are nothing less than an abomination on humanity. I see a government that arrogates to itself the right to assassinate anyone on the planet that it deems displeasing. How many movements against tyranny and injustice has the United States sought to destroy, or fought relentlessly, or strafed and killed, simply because they threaten the cruel despots we call ""friends and allies?""Meantime, our military far more closely resembles the resplendent British regiments our Continental veterans once met in battle -- even if their digital camo looks nothing like royal scarlet and gold. General officers act like courtiers, and pin stripe courtiers ape the Roman Cubicularii of the imperial court, desperately seeking face time with the emperor. The radiance of our palace precincts on the Potomac far outshines the old limestone digs of the Sun King.Yet what of all those fine officers I have taught, and with whom I served these years? They remain the stalwart and the good, like great rocks in a sea, to be used up by the system, where the waters rush over them, inexorably wearing them away.And the people, for whom The Fourth is simply sunny respite for family BBQ, fireworks, and flat screen action, where have you been? Where have you been while the grand enterprise of the imperial state has played out its game of ""strategic competition"" and forever war these fifteen years?You are supposed to be the army. You are supposed to be the state. You are supposed to be the unstoppable defending force of the American Idea. After all, you were not so long ago the very ones who always fought for liberty. My father fought. My uncle fought and died. Now, at BBQ, you have forgotten even what once you did.Thus, in every great nation in every time, the idea for which we serve is always lost, long before the fall.Michael Vlahos signed on to naval service in November 1974, serving also in the State Department and CIA, most recently teaching at the US Naval War College."

Make them in your own backyard with these 5 easy-to-follow tips: 1. Use readily available 85% lean ground beef. There's no need to grind your own meat or use a custom blend.2. Mix your beef with a panade. This is a mixture of mashed bread and milk that keeps the meat tender and juicy even when cooked to medium-well. 3. Flavor your beef. I like to add garlic, salt, pepper, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and scallions. 4. Shape the meat into thick patties. This will ensure that the burgers get nicely charred on the outside without over-cooking on the inside. To prevent the burgers from forming a domed shape on the grill, create a slight depression in the center of each patty.5. Finally, don't fiddle with your burgers while they cook. Grill your burgers for a few minutes on the first side until they are nicely browned, then flip once and cook until desired doneness is reached. Resist the urge to open the grill or flip the burgers too often, as this will prevent them from searing and developing nice grill marks. There you have it: the secret to making tender, juicy and flavorful steakhouse burgers at home. GET THE RECIPE and enjoy!Intern Alyssa Rhodes contributed to this article."
