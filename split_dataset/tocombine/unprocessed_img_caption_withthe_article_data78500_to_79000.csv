At the middle of the picture is the largest, central member of the family of galaxies (upper right red dot of central pair). Unlike other central galaxies in clusters, this one is bursting with the birth of new stars.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f3399f2c00003600aaf8f2.jpeg?cache=1zNCtEJTcq&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A team of international astronomers has discovered a rare and colossal cluster of galaxies that is turning preconceived notions on their head -- and giving scientists plenty of fodder for inventive metaphors.According to a release, the discovery shows a ""beast of a galaxy cluster whose heart is bursting with new stars.""SpARCS1049+56 -- as the cluster has been tagged -- is 9.8 billion light years from Earth, contains at least 27 individual galaxies and has a total mass equal to about 400 trillion suns.Scientists say the dominant galaxy at the cluster's heart is stealing gas from a neighbor galaxy as it spits out an incredible 860 stars per year. For contrast, our Milky Way galaxy gives birth to only one or two new stars per year.The discovery -- originally made with telescopes atop Mauna Kea on Hawaii's Big Island -- is the first to show that gigantic galaxies at the center of massive clusters can grow significantly by feeding off gas stolen from   other galaxies.Tracy Webb of McGill University in Montreal, the lead author of the study, said in a statement that usually stars at the centers of galaxy clusters are old and dead, essentially fossils.""But we think the giant galaxy at the center of this cluster is furiously making new stars after merging with a smaller galaxy,"" she said.After making initial observations with the Hawaii telescopes, astronomers turned to NASA's Hubble Space Telescope to pinpoint what was fueling the ""furious episode of new starbirth."" ""Hubble found a trainwreck of a merger at the centre of this cluster,""Adam Muzzin of the University of Cambridge said in a release. There was also the presence of ""beads on a string,"" or pockets of gas that condense where new stars are forming.CFH says such gas pockets are a telltale sign of collisions between gas-rich galaxies, a phenomenon known to astronomers as ""wet mergers,"" where gas is quickly converted to new stars. Dry mergers, on the other hand, occur when galaxies with little gas collide and no new stars are formed.The new discovery is reportedly one of the first known cases of a wet merger at the core of a distant galaxy cluster.“It is very exciting to have discovered such an interesting object,” Wilson said. “Understanding its nature proved to be a real scientific challenge which required the combined efforts of an international team of astronomers and many of the world’s best telescopes to solve.

1,ENTERTAINMENT,'The Martian' Is One Of The Year's Best Movies,Matthew Jacobs,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-martian-review_us_55f43d63e4b042295e3688e5,Matt Damon and Ridley Scott find a space epic worthy of their talents.,2015-09-12,Likely to Garner the Most Oscar Buzz: “The Danish Girl”,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ef1a681d0000ea01146f6d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Remember that perplexing scene in ""Interstellar"" when Matt Damon pops up and tries to kill Matthew McConaughey so he can return to Earth? The one that, as the Internet gladly pointed out last year, was rife with plot holes and silly space fisticuffs? I'd like to think that Damon saw his bit in the Christopher Nolan film, rolled his eyes and said, ""The moviegoing world deserves better. Let's do better.""Enter ""The Martian."" It started as a popular debut novel by Andy Weir, but the movie could have easily gone south: Sci-fi maestro Ridley Scott (""Alien,"" ""Blade Runner"") hasn't made a great film since 2007's ""American Gangster,"" and this lofty yarn was greenlit under the shadow of the technologically groundbreaking ""Gravity"" and Nolan's aforementioned space-time epic. But the Damon comeuppance that I've concocted in my imagination is quite applicable indeed, because ""The Martian"" is phenomenal.Having premiered at the ongoing Toronto Film Festival ahead of its Oct. 2 release, ""The Martian"" is a populist sci-fi adventure that clocks in at more than two hours, yet flies by. It's like the film operates at zero gravity -- it's nerdy if you want it to be, but there is nothing fussy or ornate to weigh it down. As a survival story about Mark Watney (Damon), an astronaut stranded on Mars after his crew flees a windstorm, it is a witty character piece brimming with humor. As an interplanetary adventure about the NASA team coordinating Mark's rescue and the botany and engineering skills he administers to stay alive, it is a thrill ride about a resourceful guy who ""sciences the shit out of"" a terrifying predicament. But scientific minutiae are not the movie's MO, however technical the jargon is at times. The story is crystal clear (bye, ""Interstellar""), the characters are three-dimensional beings without a hammy metaphor to work toward (sorry, ""Gravity""), and the aesthetics are so understatedly beautiful that you might forget to marvel (see ya, Marvel). And the supporting cast! Oh, that dynamite supporting cast. Mark's crew comprises Jessica Chastain, who plays the mission's sturdy commander, as well as Michael Peña, Kate Mara, Sebastian Stan and Aksel Hennie. Back in Houston, where there is most definitely a problem that extends to a national PR crisis, we find Jeff Daniels as the NASA director, Chiwetel Ejiofor as a scientific strategist and Donald Glover as an 11th-hour savior. Not to mention Kristen Wiig (though the movie doesn't quite know what to do with her character), Sean Bean and Mackenzie Davis, who carries a surprising amount of the earthbound humor. That's an expansive list of actors, and Drew Goddard's script manages to give each his or her proper due. We don't know much about Mark's and the others' lives beyond Mars and/or NASA, and that's perfectly fine because we understand what makes them tick within the parameters of their plight. That's a true accomplishment.I expect ""The Martian"" will find the box-office velocity it deserves. It's the third movie I've seen this year, after ""Mad Max: Fury Road"" and ""Inside Out,"" that is worthy of a Best Picture nomination, which it very well could garner. But first, let yourself be carried up, up and away by the film, whose stirring conclusion had me in tears. ""The Martian"" is removed from the dystopian-slanted existentialism that has come to define science-fiction since ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" bolstered the genre in 1968. This movie has heart. With that, Ridley Scott has given us something special. For continuous updates from the Toronto Film Festival, follow Matthew Jacobs and Erin Whitney on Twitter.

2,POLITICS,"The Shutdown Congress, And Why The GOP Can't Help Itself",Arthur Delaney and Michael McAuliff,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/government-shutdown-gop_us_55f34c45e4b077ca094f392f,"""A luxury this country cannot afford.""",2015-09-12,"Rep. Dave Reichert noted that Congress represents a ""pretty diverse"" country.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_89_49_5046_2696%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. government shut down for 16 days in 2013 because some Republicans wanted to ""defund"" Obamacare. The shutdown hurt the economy and polls showed Americans blamed the GOP.Several Republican lawmakers said it was a mistake.House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) have both vowed there will be no more shutting down of the government. On Friday, McConnell called it ""an exercise in futility."" Last month, he summed up the folly by saying ""there's no education in the second kick of a mule.""Nevertheless, a sizable contingent in their party appears ready for a remedial encounter with the hooves. The government will run out of money at the end of September, and while congressional leaders have yet to offer a plan to keep the lights on, some Republicans have already seized on the notion of linking that vital spending to a bill defunding Planned Parenthood -- a move that would guarantee deadlock.From the perspective of anti-abortion Republicans, however, the likelihood of failure is less important. Since they lack the votes to win their goals, they are left with few ways to advance their cause or satisfy their voters.""If we pass a piece of legislation that defunds the president's unconstitutional actions on immigration or defunds an organization like Planned Parenthood -- if we do that, we simply don't get a vote [in the Senate], and therefore to maintain that position requires a government shutdown,"" Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz.) told reporters Friday in an attempt to explain the dilemma. ""It's an insidious tragedy.""Democrats are not impressed.""What they are saying is, for an ideological bent in their caucus they would shut down the government,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Friday. ""They are a luxury this country cannot afford.""Franks is one of 40-plus members of the House Freedom Caucus, a group devoted to cutting off Planned Parenthood's federal funding over sting videos that purport to show the organization harvests aborted baby parts for profit (not true). Some of the caucus' members, including Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), seem to regret the 2013 shutdown.""Should I have maybe gotten another strategy to address that?"" Meadows said to the Asheville Citizen-Times last year. ""I think history shows us the answer to that is yes.""Jordan made a similar remark this week.""I think some of the tactics and strategy used in that showdown and that debate two years ago were wrong,"" Jordan said on C-SPAN on Thursday. ""But I don't think it's a mistake to fight for what we told the voters we were going to fight for.""Rep. Dave Reichert (Wash.), a more moderate Republican, said the problem stems not just from the members of Congress, but from the people who send them to Washington.""They bring those thoughts, ideas and positions on issues here, and they're pretty diverse around the country right now, as you can see,"" said Reichert, speaking slowly and choosing his words carefully. ""So that brings that diversity here.""While he declined to say what he wanted in a government funding bill, Reichert suggested he would prefer a little more compromise from his colleagues.""On both sides there are groups that are fixed in ideological positions, and sometimes, in these major bills, they're unwilling to adjust their ideological belief,"" he said.""I come from an area of the world, a profession that, you know, it's right and wrong, you're going to jail/you're not going to jail kind of deal. I was a SWAT commander, I was a hostage negotiator, and here both of those come in handy, by the way,"" Reichert said. ""Here, it's a gray world, and the definition of right and wrong is fuzzy, and so I think it complicates things.""Over the last four years, the gray, fuzzy world he referred to has become downright destructive, from causing a near default on the nation's debt in 2011 to the government closure in 2013, not to mention periodic blockages that have shuttered airports, threatened the Department of Homeland Security and halted road construction projects. Though the federal government has shut down only once in the Obama era, the threat has been constant. Congress flirted with shutdowns several times in 2011 and again last year in a bid to stop the president's immigration policies.The prospects for this year include not just a government shutdown showdown, but acrimonious battles next month over extending the debt limit and reauthorizing a long-term highway bill. Failure on any of those is likely to cost the nation and the economy billions of dollars. A string of tax breaks is also set to expire unless Congress acts.""The perfect storm is out there, brewing,"" Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said Wednesday when asked about the unfinished business.Politically, the dysfunction can be equally destructive. While the battles may please lawmakers' most ardent constituents, Democrats are quick to point out how deeply unpopular the episodes are with the broader public.The current Planned Parenthood dispute feeds easily into Democratic charges of a war on women by the GOP.Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) said that both the 2013 shutdown over Obamacare and the new threat to Planned Parenthood, which provides abortions but mostly offers women's health services, are attacks on women's health. All the lawmakers who've signed a letter vowing to defund the organization are men -- a fact that has already spawned an online ad campaign.""I wouldn't put it past them if they never went to speak to a woman about these issues,"" DeLauro told the HuffPost Politics podcast. ""Secondly, if they did, no one wanted to get on. And third, as I'd say, this is more than a letter, this is about a lack of respect and dignity of women and a lack of trust in the choices women make for their medical needs and the needs of their families.""Listen to DeLauro's interview here:Franks told HuffPost that Republican women have, in fact, attended Freedom Caucus gatherings. ""The meetings that we've had in these listening sessions have been filled with a lot of the female members of this conference,"" he said.None of those women has signed the letter, though.The effort to link defunding Planned Parenthood to funding the government could still fail. Even if it does, the monkey wrench it has thrown into the appropriations process may have already set the course for a shutdown.That's because Republican lawmakers, unable to come up with a spending plan, have yet to talk to Democrats, who have been saying since spring that they will not vote for anything that looks like the budget blueprint that the GOP passed earlier in the year.Congress is scheduled to be in session just nine more days before the money runs out at midnight on Sept. 30. Reid and other Democrats have been adamant in saying they will not simply accept whatever the GOP gives them at the last second.So even if the members of the ""shutdown caucus"" -- as some Democrats call them -- lose on the anti-abortion battle, they could wind up with their shutdown, anyway."

4,THE WORLDPOST,An Egyptian Billionaire Explains His Plan To Buy An Island For Refugees,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/egyptian-billionaire-island-for-refugees_us_55f48e37e4b077ca094f5abc,"First, get the consent of the government that owns the island. The rest is ""very simple.""",2015-09-12,Egyptian telecommunications magnate Naguib Sawiris is providing new details about his plan to buy an island shelter for hundreds of thousands of refugees trying to reach Europe.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f491732c00003600aaf988.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"An Egyptian billionaire provided new details about his plan to buy an island to receive hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria and other conflict-ridden nations, in an interview that will air on CNN Sunday.Naguib Sawiris, who as CEO of the Cairo-based Orascom Telecom Media and Technology is believed to be worth at least $2.9 billion, spoke on an episode of ""Fareed Zakaria GPS"" that will air Sunday.The first step of his plan to resolve the refugee crisis requires getting the consent of Greece or Italy, from whom he plans to purchase the island. Since the refugees do not have visas, there must still be a country willing to process their entry. Sawiris appeared to imply that providing some kind of legal status for the refugees, even on an uninhabited island, would be harder than buying the island itself.“You can't just take people and put them on an island that you bought that falls under jurisdiction,” Sawiris told Fareed Zakaria, according to a transcript of the interview.“We need -- a passport control agency,” he added. “We need people to check them out. You need their data. You need customs.”The next step is to identify and buy the island from Greece or Italy. Sawaris estimates there are dozens of relatively uninhabited islands that could accommodate refugees, he told Agence France-Presse.The rest of the work, Sawiris said, he can handle on his own and is “very simple” by comparison. Sawiris imagines building a temporary marina on the island to receive the refugees, as well as housing, schools and a hospital for the families to use when they arrive. Then he would give them jobs building a city on the island, because, he said, “this war is not going to end in weeks or in months. It may be years even.”Sawiris first announced the island plan on Twitter on Sept. 1.The tragic images of Aylan Kurdi, the 3-year-old Syrian boy who drowned with his mother and brother attempting to reach Greece, inspired him to act, Sawiris confirmed. ""This was the moment of what I said -- I mean I cannot just sit like that and just do nothing, you know, and pretend it's not my problem,"" he said.Sawiris plans to name the island shelter ""Aylan Island"" in the boy’s memory.While Sawiris’ proposal might normally be dismissed as fantastical, the failure of world governments to address what the United Nations is calling the worst global refugee crisis since World War II has opened the door to unconventional ideas. The European Union announced a plan Wednesday to resettle 160,000 of the mostly Syrian refugees who have arrived in Europe in recent months among European Union nations.But the EU’s new policy is unlikely to meet the scale of the refugee crisis. At least 350,000 people have migrated into Europe from January to August by official estimates -- a major increase from last year that is driven by the Syrian civil war and other conflicts. More than 2,600 have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea trying to reach Europe.  Germany alone expects to receive 800,000 asylum seekers by the end of the year.Sawiris commended his native Egypt for taking in Syrian refugees, but agreed with the growing criticism of the wealthy Arab Gulf nations, who have not granted asylum to Syrian refugees even as they fund rebel groups in the country.The Gulf nations “should really be pitching in or trying to help these poor people,” Sawiris said.Also on HuffPost:"
5,THE WORLDPOST,Socialist Elected UK Opposition Labour Leader,"William James and Michael Holden, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/socialist-uk-labour-leader-jeremy-corbyn_us_55f40e87e4b042295e3685d7,"LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Karl Marx admirer Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader of Britain's opposition Labour party on Saturday",2015-09-12,"Jeremy Corbyn is announced the new leader of the Labour Party at the Queen Elizabeth II conference centre on September 12, 2015 in London, England.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55f40fde2c00003600aaf95b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LONDON, Sept 12 (Reuters) - Karl Marx admirer Jeremy Corbyn was elected leader of Britain's opposition Labour party on Saturday, a victory that may make a British EU exit more likely and which one former Labour prime minister has said could leave their party unelectable.Greeted by cheers from supporters in the room and hailed by radicals across Europe, Corbyn's triumph opened up the prospect of deep splits within Labour with some fearing he will repel voters with radical policies that include unilateral nuclear disarmament, nationalization and wealth taxes.""Things can and they will change,"" Corbyn, who when he entered the contest was a rank outsider, said in his acceptance speech after taking 59.5 percent of votes cast, winning by a far bigger margin than anyone had envisaged.""I say thank you in advance to us all working together to achieve great victories, not just electorally for Labour, but emotionally for the whole of our society to show we don't have to be unequal, it doesn't have to be unfair, poverty isn't inevitable,"" the grey-haired, bearded 66-year-old said.His victory reflects growing popular support for left-wing movements across Europe, with Syriza taking power in Greece and Spain's anti-austerity party Podemos performing well in opinion polls.Corbyn's rise also has an echo of the way Senator Bernie Sanders has galvanized left-leaning Democrats in his bid to beat Hillary Clinton to the party's nomination for the U.S. presedential race.""Corbyn's victory as leader of the Labour party is great news, it's a step towards a change in Europe for the benefit of the people,"" Podemos leader Pablo Iglesias wrote on Twitter.However, the scale of division Corbyn's victory has created in his own party was immediately laid bare with one Labour lawmaker quitting his role as a health spokesman while Corbyn was making his acceptance speech.Others quickly followed, saying they would not serve in his senior team.LABOUR SWERVING LEFTA vegetarian republican who only received backing from fellow Labour lawmakers to enter the contest to ensure wide debate, Corbyn has struck a chord with many Labour supporters by repudiating the pro-business consensus of Tony Blair, who won three elections for Labour but is now widely unpopular, not least because of his involvement in the invasion of Iraq.Corbyn has offered wealth taxes and ambiguity about EU membership. He is a strong opponent of military strikes in Syria, meaning it would be harder for Prime Minister David Cameron to win parliamentary support to bomb Islamic State targets there.""Going to war creates a legacy of bitterness and problems. Let us be a force for change in the world, a force for humanity in the world, a force for peace in the world,"" Corbyn said.He also voted 'No' to Europe in a 1975 plebiscite and his success could make Britain's exit from the European Union more likely when Cameron holds an in/out referendum by 2017.Corbyn defeated two former Labour ministers, Yvette Cooper and Andy Burnham, and Liz Kendall, regarded as the heir to Blair.A parliamentary veteran of more than 30 years with a long history of voting against his own party, Corbyn triumphed on a message of promising to increase government investment through money-printing and renationalising vast swathes of the economy.""OFF THE CLIFF?""The prospect of a return to the party's socialist origins in commitment to partnership with trade unions and state ownership has drawn stark predictions it could be annihilated in 2020 national elections by a British public that in May re-elected Cameron for a second term on a promise to cut welfare spending.""The party is walking eyes shut, arms outstretched over the cliff's edge to the jagged rocks below,"" said former centrist Labour prime minister Blair in a plea to voters to stop the Corbyn surge before the result was announced.Some party members have even said Labour could split or that Corbyn would face a revolt by some of his lawmakers.Neil Coyle, one of those who nominated Corbyn but actually supported his rival Cooper, queried his leadership potential.""How is it that he's been in parliament since 1983, and yet he can't find 35 MPs (lawmakers) to put him on the ballot paper who genuinely think he'll do a good job?"" Coyle told Reuters.However, Ed Miliband who led the party to heavy defeat in May's election when Cameron won an unexpected overall majority, rejected Blair's prediction the party faced annihilation.""He has a big job to do to seek to unite the party and I believe he does intend to do that,"" Miliband told reporters.PRIME MINISTER CORBYN?Labour suffered a particularly crushing defeat in Scotland where it lost all but one of its 41 seats to the anti-austerity Scottish National Party, which has also tapped into political disillusionment with Britain's established political class.""The scale of the challenge to win in 2020 is huge, we've got to win back Scotland, in the English shires,"" said David Lammy, a Labour lawmaker.""I'm not entirely won over that the 'left' message is sufficient to win government in this country.""By promising to increase, rather than cut, government investment through money-printing, Corbyn found favor among disillusioned young voters and socialists who had drifted away from the party after nearly two decades battling for the political center ground.The likely abandonment of the political center ground, particularly on the subject of balancing Britain's books, is seen by many as a gift for the Conservative Party that could herald a prolonged spell in power for the center-right party.""Their whole debate seems to ignore what almost every other political party in almost every other country has now grasped,"" Cameron said, referring to Corbyn's anti-austerity views.""It's arguing at the extremes of the debate, simply wedded to more and more spending, more and more borrowing and more and more taxes. And in that regard they pose a clear threat to the financial security of every family in Britain."" (Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Ralph Boulton)"

The leaked documents that served as evidence that Peña Nieto’s government steered contracts to the Grupo Higa company can now be viewed on Méxicoleaks, a website set up earlier this year for anyone to whistleblow and anonymously reveal information. Since then the website has made headlines and is increasingly serving as an independent “watchdog” of government practices. In March, Aristegui was fired by MVS News, the radio company she worked for while investigating the Casa Blanca scandal, because of her involvement in Méxicoleaks.“Méxicoleaks was an excuse,” said Sebastian Barragán Hidalgo, 29, of the MVS News decision to terminate Aristegui’s position, her radio program and the investigative team. He believes she may have been fired because of government pressure on MVS's business interests.Barragán, who was part of that MVS news team that was fired, now works for Aristegui News -- a 17-reporter team run by Aristegui and one of the eight organizations that receives leaks from citizens via Méxicoleaks. (The other participating organizations include PODER, Animal Politico, Emeequis, Aristegui Noticias, MásDe 131, Periodistas de a pie, Proceso, R3D).All eight members of Méxicoleaks have access to the platform where they can anonymously read whistleblowers' data -- audio and video files, documents, or anything else. All leaks submitted by to the website are checked through both technical and journalistic verification processes based on multiple sources. On a gray Mexico City afternoon in June, Barragán sat in a small room in the back of an unmarked office in a nondescript building that is home to Aristegui News. He works as the point person for receiving and prioritizing leaked information through the Méxicoleaks platform.All kinds of leaks cross Barragán’s screen.“Pictures of cats -- one person found on Instagram that a public official owned a jaguar and asked us to review whether the jaguar was in good condition and how the official got him. Some people find things on social media and send tips. But if there are no documents attached to these allegations, there is no investigation,” Barragán said.Most of the information received deals with issues of corruption, mismanagement or overspending of public funds, or unethical relationships or bribes involving officials and the private sector.Barragán receives these leaks anywhere using his laptop and a small USB thumbdrive key. The information and the sender's identity are both anonymous and the task of checking out the veracity of the allegations is shared among the participating organizations. Barragán said that if the thumb-drive key is lost or stolen, all the information is encrypted or concealed by secret codes so that no names are attached to anything; a case file is represented by just a series of numbers.While there is no exact translation of 'whistleblowers' in Spanish, there is a great need for them in a country increasingly mired in corruption and impunity. According to Transparency International’s 2014 corruption index, Mexico scored 35 on a scale where 0 is highly corrupt and 100 very clean.The most recent leak in May of this year, reported by Proceso, led to Peña Nieto admitting that the Mexican government had spent nearly a million pesos (around $60,000) on 37 hotel rooms in Brussels for a summit of the European Union and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.For Benjamin Cokelet, the executive director of PODER, which is one of the co-founders of Méxicoleaks, the project is less about “breaking a couple sexy stories” and more about creating “systematic support by the Mexican government of whistleblowers and recognizing their role in the democratic process.” Cokelet is also the director of the Project on Organizing, Development, Education, and Research, a five-year-old corporate accountability, transparency, and human rights NGO based in New York and Mexico.The idea to create Méxicoleaks came out of a conversation in June 2014 between Cokelet and Leon Willems at Free Press Unlimited, a foundation based in the Netherlands that supports media freedoms. Méxicoleaks was launched in March 2015 and now receives hundreds of leaks. The site heralds a new kind of watchdog journalism and culture where technologists, journalists and citizens are collaborating to create and demand transparency. It is part of a growing trend in Mexico of people using information and communication technologies to increase transparency and to denounce government corruption.“It’s about everyday citizens denouncing everyday acts of corruption,"" said Raúl Benítez Manaut, a public policy scholar and researcher at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México. Manaut believes Méxicoleaks will become the central hub for Mexicans who want to share and verify information about the government and other public entities. ""It will be the network of networks in Mexico [over] the next year and that’s what makes the government tremble,” he said.Kara Andrade is a researcher, journalist and entrepreneur who focuses on Latin America, media, technology and society.

The leaked documents that served as evidence that Peña Nieto’s government steered contracts to the Grupo Higa company can now be viewed on Méxicoleaks, a website set up earlier this year for anyone to whistleblow and anonymously reveal information. Since then the website has made headlines and is increasingly serving as an independent “watchdog” of government practices. In March, Aristegui was fired by MVS News, the radio company she worked for while investigating the Casa Blanca scandal, because of her involvement in Méxicoleaks.“Méxicoleaks was an excuse,” said Sebastian Barragán Hidalgo, 29, of the MVS News decision to terminate Aristegui’s position, her radio program and the investigative team. He believes she may have been fired because of government pressure on MVS's business interests.Barragán, who was part of that MVS news team that was fired, now works for Aristegui News -- a 17-reporter team run by Aristegui and one of the eight organizations that receives leaks from citizens via Méxicoleaks. (The other participating organizations include PODER, Animal Politico, Emeequis, Aristegui Noticias, MásDe 131, Periodistas de a pie, Proceso, R3D).All eight members of Méxicoleaks have access to the platform where they can anonymously read whistleblowers' data -- audio and video files, documents, or anything else. All leaks submitted by to the website are checked through both technical and journalistic verification processes based on multiple sources. On a gray Mexico City afternoon in June, Barragán sat in a small room in the back of an unmarked office in a nondescript building that is home to Aristegui News. He works as the point person for receiving and prioritizing leaked information through the Méxicoleaks platform.All kinds of leaks cross Barragán’s screen.“Pictures of cats -- one person found on Instagram that a public official owned a jaguar and asked us to review whether the jaguar was in good condition and how the official got him. Some people find things on social media and send tips. But if there are no documents attached to these allegations, there is no investigation,” Barragán said.Most of the information received deals with issues of corruption, mismanagement or overspending of public funds, or unethical relationships or bribes involving officials and the private sector.Barragán receives these leaks anywhere using his laptop and a small USB thumbdrive key. The information and the sender's identity are both anonymous and the task of checking out the veracity of the allegations is shared among the participating organizations. Barragán said that if the thumb-drive key is lost or stolen, all the information is encrypted or concealed by secret codes so that no names are attached to anything; a case file is represented by just a series of numbers.While there is no exact translation of 'whistleblowers' in Spanish, there is a great need for them in a country increasingly mired in corruption and impunity. According to Transparency International’s 2014 corruption index, Mexico scored 35 on a scale where 0 is highly corrupt and 100 very clean.The most recent leak in May of this year, reported by Proceso, led to Peña Nieto admitting that the Mexican government had spent nearly a million pesos (around $60,000) on 37 hotel rooms in Brussels for a summit of the European Union and the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States.For Benjamin Cokelet, the executive director of PODER, which is one of the co-founders of Méxicoleaks, the project is less about “breaking a couple sexy stories” and more about creating “systematic support by the Mexican government of whistleblowers and recognizing their role in the democratic process.” Cokelet is also the director of the Project on Organizing, Development, Education, and Research, a five-year-old corporate accountability, transparency, and human rights NGO based in New York and Mexico.The idea to create Méxicoleaks came out of a conversation in June 2014 between Cokelet and Leon Willems at Free Press Unlimited, a foundation based in the Netherlands that supports media freedoms. Méxicoleaks was launched in March 2015 and now receives hundreds of leaks. The site heralds a new kind of watchdog journalism and culture where technologists, journalists and citizens are collaborating to create and demand transparency. It is part of a growing trend in Mexico of people using information and communication technologies to increase transparency and to denounce government corruption.“It’s about everyday citizens denouncing everyday acts of corruption,"" said Raúl Benítez Manaut, a public policy scholar and researcher at the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México.

""At a time of mass income and wealth inequality throughout the world, I am delighted to see that the British Labour Party has elected Jeremy Corbyn as its new leader,"" Sanders, a Democratic presidential candidate, said in a statement emailed to The Huffington Post Saturday. ""We need leadership in every country in the world which tells the billionaire class that they cannot have it all. We need economies that work for working families, not just the people on top.""Sanders’ appreciation of Corbyn is mutual. A week before his victory, Corbyn said he was following Sanders’ campaign with ""great interest.""Corbyn’s upset election as head of Labour, which makes him the de facto opposition leader in the U.K. parliament, has drawn comparisons to Sanders’ rise in the American political landscape. Like Corbyn, Sanders has achieved unexpected popularity by proposing dramatic solutions to end income inequality and reform the political process. The two left-leaning legislators also share an unglamorous demeanor.Corbyn is nonetheless to the left of Sanders, advocating for policies like the nationalization of Britain’s main power providers. Historically, the UK’s economic policies have been more socialistic than those of the U.S.  Also on HuffPost:"

Today, we speak with Alexander Betts, Director of the University of Oxford's Refugee Studies Centre.The thousands of men, women and children streaming through the borders of Europe have finally drawn the world's attention to a historic crisis.The United Nations first warned over a year ago that more people around the world had been forcibly displaced than at any time since World War II. That figure has since risen from 51 million people to almost 60 million. The main reason behind the spike in refugees is four years of brutal war in Syria, the U.N. says. Europe has struggled to muster a response. Germany is among a few countries who have have been willing to welcome a substantial number of refugees and sought a common European strategy to deal with the crisis. Other nations have locked down their borders, crammed refugees into transit camps, and said they won't take in Muslims, creating alarming echoes of the past for WWII historians and Holocaust survivors. In the aftermath of the World War II refugee crisis, the world set up the first legal protection regime for refugees and created a plethora of multinational organizations to assist refugees and migrants. Alexander Betts, Director of the University of Oxford's Refugee Studies Centre and a Professor of Refugee and Forced Migration Studies, laid out five history lessons for dealing with the refugee crisis in a Guardian column this week. The WorldPost spoke to Betts about whether the refugee crisis after WWII might shed light on the crisis in Europe today.Does Europe’s response to the current refugee crisis look pretty lackluster by comparison to the efforts after WWII?There are more people displaced around the world than at any time since the Second World War, and Syria alone is the largest refugee crisis in a generation.Until recently, the dominant assumption in Europe was that refugee issues primarily affected other parts of the world. Europe has faced large refugee movements during, for example, the Bosnia and Kosovo conflicts of the 1990s. However, this is the first time in its history that Europe has faced a mass influx of refugees from outside the region.The existing Common European Asylum System was not designed for such a situation. With the notable exception of Germany, few European countries emerge with much credit. Although this is gradually changing, there has been a lack of political leadership and moral courage. Over 2,700 people have died this year at Europe’s borders and a lot of this would have been preventable with more urgency and better political choices. What lessons can we learn from the WWII crisis that could be applicable today?  There is a lot to be learned from history. European states were the architects of the modern refugee regime. They negotiated the 1951 Refugee Convention in the aftermath of the Holocaust. It is a legacy we should be proud of and seek to preserve. It was a moment at which Europe collectively understood that people fleeing persecution should have a right to seek refuge in order to access fundamental human rights. However, I also think there are other more recent historical lessons that are important today. For example, from 1975 on literally millions of Vietnamese refugees fled to South-East Asian states. Many drowned as boats were pushed back. But in both 1979 and 1989, international agreements were made such that some 1.8 million people were resettled around the world. The key was international cooperation; recognizing that refugee protection is a shared, global responsibility.Yet some refugees languished without help for years after WWII ended. Is it unfair to expect Europe to respond immediately today?It’s true that many refugees did not receive immediate support after the Second World War. But I do not think we have the same excuses today. We have learned a lot over the last 70 years.Around the world, a neglected tragedy that is poorly understood is the situation of protracted displacement. Over half the world’s refugees have been in exile for at least five years, many in closed refugee camps where they do not have the right to work or move freely. This leads to an unacceptable waste of humanity. We should be recognizing that, with the right policies, refugees have skills, talents and aspirations, and the ability to contribute socially and economically. We should not be leaving people in limbo.Despite the huge efforts after WWII, there was nationalist and anti-Semitic backlash at the time. Do you see any parallels with the responses of far-right or anti-Muslim attitudes in Europe today?From the start of the Syria crisis, there has been inadequate willingness to resettle Syrian refugees. The unspoken reason for this has been fear of admitting large numbers of Muslims.In Europe today, many people have a fear of immigration and terrorism. But there is a small but growing element of latent fascism. In many countries far-right parties are influencing the political agendas of mainstream parties. There is a genuine risk of a backlash over time, and it’s very important that politicians show leadership in countering xenophobic narratives.You’ve written about the increase in “survival migration” -- people fleeing for their lives but who don’t match the traditional definition of refugees. Is the refugee protection system that was set up after WWII still fit for purpose today?It is very important that we protect the distinctive rights of refugees and that we safeguard the 1951 Convention. If we tried to renegotiate that framework, it’s unlikely we would get such a good deal for refugees today.However, it is also worth recognizing that the nature of cross-border displacement is changing, particularly with climate change, state fragility, and food insecurity, for example. Increasingly, people will flee for reasons that are not captured by the existing refugee regime's focus on ""persecution."" It will therefore inevitably become necessary to develop new policies and laws to provide protection for a broader category of ""survival migrants."" In order to absorb growing numbers, though, we will need creative policies that rethink the nature of protection and assistance. These will include recognizing the capacities rather than just the vulnerabilities of refugees. To be sustainable, we will need to help people to help themselves, integrate them into the global economy, and empower them to make an economic contribution. For example, Uganda has adopted a Self-Reliance Strategy that gives refugees the right to work and significant freedom of movement. In our research, we've been able to show these kinds of policies can lead to better outcomes for refugees and host communities.Does the current refugee crisis challenge the whole post-WWII idea of a European community, considering how difficult it has been for these nations to define a common policy on refugees, migration or border controls?As has been widely acknowledged, this is a defining moment for the European Union. Key European values, such as regional cooperation and respect for human rights, are under threat.To be effective in this area, the EU has to come up with an approach based on collective action. It needs a refugee policy to share responsibility within Europe and to support refugee protection globally.However, it is struggling to either come up with a shared policy vision or to build political consensus around that vision. Angela Merkel has shown remarkable leadership, and a core group of countries are now working together. However, a number of other countries are refusing to cooperate and are instead pursuing unilateral strategies. Also on HuffPost:"

Postpartum depression/anxiety (PPD/A) in women, a common and often undiagnosed illness in biological, adoptive, or lesbian partner moms, has finally gained greater awareness by mental health professionals, obstetricians, and the general public. While many women still suffer in silence, recent efforts have given PPD sufferers a voice. There is no shame, there is no need to hide. PPD/A is a mental health issue and one over which the sufferer has no control. I know. I had PPD/A after my second child. It hit me a few weeks into his life, and it hit hard. It's not just depression or sadness, symptoms can include anxiety, rage, intrusive thoughts, OCD behavior, and more. When I had it, I was overwhelmed by anxiety. I was also depressed, but the anxiety was debilitating. I thought I would perish. I thought my baby would perish. I was terrified. But, I told my doctor, I was heard, and I got help. I survived.Men suffer too, and more attention is needed to understand how they suffer, and how men respond to treatment. Depression knows no gender, including postnatal depression. Researchers are still in the early stages of understanding the male experience with depression; paternal postnatal depression (PPND) research lags further behind. Men experience depression differently than women, and we know that men are more likely to hide depression and/or to withdraw which only serves to worsen symptoms. PPND research suggests men may develop symptoms more gradually over the course of a child's first year, while typically, but not always, women see symptoms earlier.The classic symptoms of depression are well known and include: depressed mood; significant weight gain or loss; restlessness; fatigue; insomnia or sleeping too much; feelings of worthlessness; difficulty with decision-making; and thoughts of suicide or death. To be diagnosed as clinically depressed, a patient must suffer from five or more of these symptoms consistently over a two week period. Depression is not ""having a bad day."" Depression can be paralyzing, frightening, and interfere with one's ability to perform daily tasks. Simply getting out of bed, showering, and getting dressed are often impossible for a depressed person. When I was in the throes of PPD/A, I was exhausted but couldn't sleep, I was physically ill with anxiety, and even simple decisions, such as what to have for lunch, felt insurmountable.In men, depression looks and feels different, and that can lead to both under-diagnosis and to men hiding their suffering. According to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), on an annual basis, over 6 million men currently suffer from depression. That's you, or your partner, or your best friend. Have you noticed a change in behavior lately in a loved one? Symptoms you might see include: increased anger; increased drinking or drug use; irritability; violence; weight loss; isolation; stress; greater risk-taking such as reckless driving or adultery; physical problems such as frequent headaches; loss of interest in sex, hobbies and family; over-working; and suicidal thoughts. While there are a few common symptoms, men clearly experience distinctly different symptoms. Based on typical depictions of depression, it would be easy to overlook increased drinking, adultery, and over-working as depressed behavior. If you are a new father, these symptoms may be gradual, but PPND can be as serious a condition as PPD/A, with some or most of these symptoms.-When you are the depressed person, all perspective is lost. Self-diagnosis is difficult, particularly if this is your first depressive episode. It is important to watch for changes in mood or behavior, particularly if you or your partner has just had or adopted a baby. Depression is a serious illness and can be fatal. In addition to the symptoms above, here are specific behaviors to look for in yourself or your partner:You (or your partner) withdraws sexually. Often after childbirth there is a hiatus in the bedroom. You're tired, mom is tired and yet the baby seems to never be tired, at least for very long. In the early days, sex may not be an issue; sleep may trump a roll in the hay. However, after the so-called fourth trimester, when couples get the doctor's go ahead to resume sexual activity, if you find your interest dramatically decreased and if you resist intimacy with your partner and feel isolated as a result, that may be cause for concern.You find yourself having an extra drink or two on a more regular basis. If you are a semi-regular drinker who is now having a beer or three with dinner and/or a Scotch before bed, you may be suffering from depression. Along the same lines, if you are a recreational drug user, or have been in the past, and you begin to seek opportunities to get high regularly, you are checking out of your reality. As a new father, this behavior would be especially troubling and cause for concern. Your faculties are compromised at a time when you need to be more available than ever. While this behavior seems simply irresponsible on the surface, when accompanied by other symptoms, it may be male depression.You work. All the time. Suddenly, staying late at the office becomes the norm. For a new father, this would be an especially noticeable symptom. Most new dads want to bond with their baby. If you are voluntarily over-working without an objective increase in work load, ask yourself why? If you are in a relationship with someone who suddenly and without apparent reason becomes a workaholic, take note. He may be depressed.Irritability is common when there is a new baby in the house. Typically, parents are not getting enough sleep and/or are worried about baby's milestones. Is he rolling over yet? Did she smile or was that gas? Is my baby OK?! When your irritability becomes anger, constant and overwhelming, this can be a warning sign. It's normal to be grumpy when you are tired. It's not healthy to be in a constant state of heightened tension. If you see this in yourself or your partner, and feel like you are walking on eggshells, it may be depression. Tread lightly and with compassion.Violence is a huge red flag, whether your ultimate diagnosis is depression or something else. If you find yourself enraged and hit another, pick fights that would lead to violence, punch holes in the wall, or in any way feel out of control with physical anger, get help. You may be depressed, you may not, but violence in a relationship is never OK. Violence against loved ones, strangers, or animals, or even closet doors, is never the answer. Something is wrong if you or your partner becomes violent. Take it seriously.-Depression is an illness, and there is no shame in seeking treatment. If you had a broken arm, you'd see a doctor, you'd get a cast, you'd heal. The same should be true with any mental health issue. If you suspect that you or a loved one is suffering, get help. You are not alone.Contact your doctor, a mental health facility or check these online resources for more information:Postpartum Men-Originally appeared at The Good Men Project.Photo---flickrkellyb/FlickrIf you -- or someone you know -- need help, please call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline.

Dr. Oliver Sacks was a kindred soul who opened a chest box full of stories hidden behind medical labels. He revealed secrets, made so called abnormalities appear with a life of their own. He humanized the vast potential of those stereotyped by their diagnosis.  In honor of his life I share a few of my secrets and a load of quirks in our visual perceptions.  I was born in a woman's hospital in Washington DC to a Woody Allen look alike in a turban and beard married to my mother ten years his junior. My birth certificate identifies me as the third child with the race column marked as Caucasian.  In my early childhood photos I look like a healthy kid with a cute smile on my face. All that appears to have changed somewhere around 1st grade. Photos past that point are without a smile.  One day while at school in first grade a teacher discovered my inability to read her chalked up words on the blackboard. On came the thick plastic framed glasses and the family treated it as a tragedy. Besides the medical challenges my future marriage prospects were on the line.  Thanks to puberty I grew up in inches, chest hair remained elusive but the hair on my head was almost down to my waist thanks to my parents religious tradition prescribing no hair cuts. One unwelcome change was the elongation of the face. Combine that with thick glasses, front teeth protruding forward due to years of thumb sucking and the entire world around me constantly reminding me how handsome my older brother was. It was true he was way more pleasing to the eyes. We both knew this. But for many this observation had to be vocalized at every social opportunity. I slowly learnt to look away from myself in the mirror thinking I could hide from my own image.  One thing I could not hide from was a hormonal mishap leading to small, tender growths right under my nipples. I never got a believable medical reason for this confusion but was glad to be under the skillful knife of a surgeon who took these growths out for good. On being taken out of surgery on a gurney some of the nurses confused me for a woman with my long hair spilled all over and near lack of any body hair.  On November 1st in 1984 my family was in a self-imposed curfew in our apartment in the Indian capital city of Delhi, following the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her two Sikh bodyguards with turbans and beards. Late morning through cracks in the curtain we saw policemen guiding a long endless mob of men armed with metal and wooden poles. Hours later we saw men returning in the opposite direction hands full of looted bounty. In the middle of it all my friends belonging to the Hindu ethnic majority were playing a game of cricket. The bizarre scene gave my father the comfort to venture out into the balcony in open view.  An empty handed man fiddling with his flip flops spotted us in our buns. It was enough for him to identify us as Sikhs. He cursed on our mother and magically a mob surrounded our apartment building. Amid the chaos my friends halted their game of cricket with the amazing presence of mind to talk the mob out of attacking us since we resided in a government owned building. The government sanctioning the carnage would not take it well at its property being the target.  When the dust settled after three days, thousands of Sikh men hunted down by their buns, beards and turbans were burnt alive on the streets of India.  The only response I could find to the carnage was to try my best to excel at school, leave home for college, far away from this madness. Colorful, smooth, fragrance filled catalogs from Carnegie Mellon, UCLA, MIT fed my day dreams.  On a September morning in 1989 I arrived in Los Angeles. I was mesmerized by the wide highways, humongous grocery stores, no one walking on the streets and blondes. College was a year away so I filled out minimum wage job applications at Taco Bell, McDonalds, Burger King, 7-11. They all said we will call you but no one did.  I found the answer on the streets, any place I walked past fellow Americans. Some laughed in hush voices, others loudly, some called me names. 'Genie', 'clown', 'raghead' and others I have forgotten.  I left California for the flat lands of the Midwest to start college at Ohio Sate University. College was a nice break from street life. One of my roommates, a native Ohioan inspired by my trial and tribulations along with then popular beer ad slogan, 'Why ask why try bud dry' came up with my candidacy for floor president in the honors dorm. He whipped up a flier with a turban sketch and the slogan, 'Why ask why try the turban guy'. We put up fliers all over the floor.  I won the election.  I did not bask for too long in my electoral triumph. I transferred to UC Santa Barbara in sophomore year. I had reached the threshold for standing out. I wanted to be invisible, to live but not be noticed.   I took a trip to the barber with my long hair tied in a pony tail. With a single clip of the scissor I bid farewell to my twenty year old unshorn hair. For a while the trick worked. Just about all the eyes were off me.  It was not take long before strangers started coming up to me to start speaking in Spanish. I responded with a ""Me no Espaniol."" Some were disappointed in me not embracing my native tongue. One man swore he had seen me in Peru.  One of the biggest side effect of college life was falling in love with books for pleasure. I grew up in a house where only two books sat on its shelves, Lady Chatterley's Lover and Cheiro's Book of Palmistry. Somehow I missed the pleasure connection.  Now in college I fell in love with words of Asimov, Freud, Plato, Nietzsche, Abott, Sacks, Huxley and Buddhism. While at UC Berkeley for graduate school I engaged in Taoist meditation sessions along with listening to Sikh hymns playing 24 hours in the background while I stayed with my deeply religious brother.   Eventually I got addicted to this spiritual candy and fell in love with the Sikh way of life. I decided to grow back my hair, a long two-year process with me ending up with a big bun on top of my head ready to serve as anchor for the 7 feet long turban. I donned one for the first time in 10 years in August 2001. A month later the 9/11 attacks happened while I was working only 15 miles north of the city.   I worked from home for the next two weeks without stepping out of home. Once I stepped out all eyes were on me, middle fingers held high as salutations by fellow riders on highways. Shouts of 'Osama' and 'Taliban' were most common greetings from strangers.  I did not know how to respond until I spotted a cartoon weeks later by Mark Fiore titled 'Find the Terrorist.' This cartoonist had captured my predicament perfectly.  So I started creating turbanful cartoons. The more 'Osama', 'Taliban', 'Terrorist' cat calls I got, the more cartoon characters with turbans and beards I spitted out from my computer. The calls never ceased. Over time they have become synchronous with news coverage.  On my first trip to the New York City Comic Con in 2011 as an exhibitor, I sought a little comical assistance from a quintessential superhero. I created a poster with a turbaned and bearded Captain America ready to kick some intolerant ass.  A photographer trying to capture me as part of a photo-essay came over and in passing mentioned perhaps I should come back next year dressed as Captain America.  Never in a million years would I dream such a thought. How could I don this uniform in my turbaned, skinny, bespectacled presence. After the massacre of Sikh worshippers at the hands of a White supremacist in Milwaukee almost a year later followed by a repeat request from the same photographer I agreed reluctantly to don the uniform.   On a sunny day in June 2013 I stepped out into the streets of New York City as Captain America for a collective mind freak. From the Met to Central Park to subway ride to the high line I stepped into a parallel universe with strangers flocking to hug me, cops taking photos of me, an FDNY truck at my disposal, getting pulled into wedding parties. That first outing led to many more in New York, Los Angeles, Kansas and Mississippi. I have heard from strangers, acting service members, veterans, teachers literally espousing their love for me.   Besides the countless admirers only two young men called me a 'Terrorist' while in uniform. When I questioned were they really calling Captain America a terrorist, they apologized profusely.  So yes I am really Sikh, American at heart, technically Caucasian, brown complexioned, perhaps unsightly, donning occasionally as Captain America with the latent power to bust your mis-perceptions."

I hope HuffPost readers will be interested in and informed by the following remembrance from the Southern Education Foundation, including her own message to young people.***In Remembrance of Lynn Walker Huntley (1946-2015)The Southern Education Foundation's staff and trustees would like to take this moment to honor President Emerita, Lynn Walker Huntley, who sadly passed away on August 30th from cervical cancer. Lynn's impact on the Foundation was tremendous. She came to SEF in 1995 from the Ford Foundation and directed the Comparative Human Relations Initiative, which examined strategies for improving race relations in Brazil, South Africa and the United States. She would later become SEF's first female president, and build out a number of important initiatives that included: No Time to Lose, Still Striving, Miles to Go, New Majority, and the Southern Education Leadership Initiative. Her powerful voice and thinking were present in the numerous publications, videos and convening efforts developed during her 15 year tenure, all aimed at ensuring poor students and students of color had equitable opportunities to learn and contribute to the common good. As her former colleagues and friends have shared from the Ford Foundation, NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund, and in the press, among many others, her career accomplishments as a civil rights attorney, advocate, researcher and philanthropist were truly incredible and inspired so many that came after her. She was first to lead the charge on critical issues here in the American South, in the US, and abroad related to human rights, racism, and equity. And through all this she was most notably humble. Lynn's SEF colleagues remember her dedication to helping those most in need, her mentorship, and her fearlessness to tell it like it is. She did all this important and daunting work somehow with a smile, and often a chuckle, that was infectious to everyone around her. She will be missed dearly and our hearts go out to her family and friends.In closing, we think it is only appropriate, that we let Lynn have the last word because frankly, no one could ever say it better than her. The following is a short essay she wrote for young people attending the World Conference Against Racism and Xenophobia that was held in Durban, South Africa in August, 2001. In this essay, she speaks to the next generation on why the struggle for ending racism and injustice in the world must go on.A Message to the Next Generation: You Are Never Too Young"

Many of us want to know. It doesn't matter whether it is asked by one of the journalists or a fellow candidate or a heckler in the audience. It just needs to be asked. Because really, what's wrong with the guy? Tell us in his own words. Ask him the question. Directly. What would he say? No doubt, ""Nothing's wrong with me. I'm almost perfect."" Or, ""I'm rich, have a beautiful wife, fabulous children, a great life. What's wrong with you?"" But it would be interesting to ask.What's going on inside the mind of someone who insults on the most personal level anyone who questions anything about him. What's wrong with someone who, when questioned by Chris Cuomo on CNN, responds by saying the ratings of Cuomo's show aren't good, who calls Ben Carson an ""okay"" physician, who smugly says of John McCain, ""I like people who weren't captured""? What motivates a person to call everything about him the best, and to deem everyone who disagrees with him the worst. Carly Fiorina was one of the worst CEOs ever. Hillary Clinton was the worst Secretary of State. He is the best deal maker, has the best organization, went to the best, hardest to get into, school in the country (not true on either count, by the way). He is the smartest, he tells us every time he can, in large part, he believes, because he is so rich. (Wealth equals intelligence -- a highly suspect construct, but one obviously central to his self-image.) Well, he ranked 140th in a recent Forbes list of wealthy Americans, which also estimated his wealth at less than half of what Donald says it is (don't get me wrong, he's rich), so there are, by his calculus, 139 smarter people in the country (in truth, of course, there are millions smarter than he), and to use his logic, 139 people likely better qualified to be President -- several of whom are women, foreign-born or possess other characteristics Donald finds odious.Think about having this guy as an employee, or even a boss. He would have been run out of the business ages ago. Could anyone stomach him? Boasting, berating, stating as facts things that are clearly not factual? The only way for such repugnant behavior to survive is to run an inherited empire. Lucky for Donald.Does anyone think that with his personality Donald would be so wealthy and powerful had Fred Trump not handed wealth and power to his son? Could this ego, this barrage of insults, this lack of self-awareness have risen up the ranks in corporate America where it would have competed with other, far smarter and more politically shrewd egos? What do the people who work for him think? Clearly, they are afraid to say, but can even those he pays well see the guy as anything other than insufferable?It would be easy to go along with the conventional wisdom that his popularity is based on his ""refreshing"" political incorrectness, that he is saying what many are thinking, and those of us bewildered by his rise are much more bewildered by those who hang on his every word.But there may be more to his following than just saying what others think and won't say. It is that mesmerizing quality of bullies and braggarts that when they bully and brag enough, people start to believe that they are as wonderful as they say and those who disagree are as awful as they say. Not sure how that works, but it does.It is depressing to see the revisionist, squirming punditry that has gone on since Donald announced he was running. Those who saw him as a joke and a sideshow are now saying, well, he's tapped into something, he should be taken seriously.No. He shouldn't be taken seriously. Even if he wins the nomination (possible), and the Presidency (given how Hillary is doing, also possible) he shouldn't be taken seriously. Those would indeed be serious events. But taking Donald seriously?Donald describes himself as an entertainer, and while we have had entertainers as governors, senators and even presidents, they have usually not been delusional as well as well as entertaining.Donald likes to say he is a counter puncher who gets ugly only when responding to attacks from others. Like everything Donald says, it's not true. He's a sucker puncher who initiates attacks, a low blow artist, who divides the world into those who agree that he is great and everyone else who will be flattened.Like all egomaniacs and bullies, he only understands the same treatment from others. We know what's wrong with Donald. But it would be such an enlightening moment if someone were to ask that very politically incorrect, and therefore very Donald Trumpian question: What is wrong with you?We would love to hear his answer.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

Perhaps it's the way the photographer-slash-environmentalist-slash-filmmaker photographs individual people in the same grandiose way he shoots majestical landscapes, or maybe it was the wisdom his team of journalists managed to extract from such diverse subjects as an African-American boy in jail for life, or a South American farmer, or an Israeli father who lost his daughter in suicide attack.

The film, as a cinematic movement to change the world, will be screened simultaneously at the United Nations in NYC, with Secretary General Ban Ki-moon in attendance, at the Biennale del cinema in Venice and on YouTube, with conversations going on through Google as well.

Trending on Twitter has never been so crucial for our survival. Human opens in France this week as well, in more than 500 theaters, which is also a groundbreaking number, worthy of a world-changing film. In fact, it appears a lot more of an effort to avoid Arthus-Bertrand stunning film than to watch it, with eleven different movies in total, including a theatrical version, TV episodic cuts and behind-the-scenes footage available on YouTube. The story of the US soldier he refers to below is only told in full online, for example. I caught up with Arthus-Bertrand in Venice, and his energy, his larger than life power is indescribable. Perhaps what feeds this genius, this champion of communication and understanding among us, is that he comprehends the power of one. It is a power we often forget -- I know I do -- the ability to change the world, one small, tiny, at times seemingly insignificant action at a time. How did you choose your subjects, those you wanted to interview?Yann Arthus-Bertrand: Above all, Human is a political film, so there were some precise themes I wished to explore through these conversations. First among these, war, because war for me remains incomprehensible. How is it possible that in civilized countries like ours children are killed? That to me is both an ethical and moral question. I myself belong to the third largest arms producing country in the world, but also the country at the forefront for the protection of human rights. That's such a paradox and an enormous contradiction and so I really wanted to speak with those persons who have killed, or have been victims of war. I'm a spoiled child because I've never lived through that. Why do people kill then, have you found the answer through your film?Arthus-Bertrand: The problem is that when someone is killed, immediately a reaction of hatred and a wish for vengeance are generated in return. You end up getting locked in a cycle from which you can never get out. We explored this principle by going to Iraq, to Syria, in the refugee camps of Jordan, in Cambodia with the Khmer Rouge, in Rwanda in central Africa where there were recent conflicts, in Ukraine and the United States. Every day in the US 17 veterans of war commit suicide. Those who commit suicide among former soldiers are more than those who die in battle. It's obvious that wars make those who fight them go mad, that man enjoys killing and loves war. One US soldier in the film clearly states that. But we must remember that all those who talk in the film are ""us"" -- they are simply a mirror reflection back because we are just like ""them.""How many questions did you ask each subject, to come up with such a complete film?Arthus-Bertrand: The questions were forty, always the same ones to each person. When we interviewed soldiers, we asked them the same questions we asked farmers.And your team, how many people were you in total?Arthus-Bertrand: Five journalists who worked for two years with five cameramen, and in each location we had a fixer, there to organize everything for one month. I worked with the areal crew which included another five persons, and then there were four more people who received the material, sorted it according to theme, language, translations etc. -- in total we were a group of twenty working on this project for two years. What is Human for you?Arthus-Bertrand: What is life?! I'm trying to be better every day. It's much easier to be successful on a professional level yet much more challenging to achieve personal satisfaction. I think the film speaks to that, the difficulties we each encounter in relation to our own lives, in maintaining valuable connections with our families and those around us and coming to terms with our personal ethics. The older I get, the more I understand how difficult those objectives are to achieve. But the answer is always love.

Back in the 1950s, the Philippines was among the world's fastest growing economies. Unlike most of its autocratic post-colonial neighbors, it also boasted an elected legislature and executive leadership, with one of the world's most liberal and democratic constitutions. It was America's showcase colony, after all. Thanks to America's relatively benign legacy -- at least compared to more predatory European colonial powers, particularly France and Netherlands, who brutally occupied Southeast Asia -- in infrastructure and basic education, the Philippines also stood as the second least poor (or prosperous) nation in East Asia, although Manila was among the world's most devastated cities during the brutal World War II. By the 1980s, after years of predatory and corruption-infested ""elite democracy"" (euphemism for electoral oligarchy) that paved the way for decades of even more devastating dictatorship, the Philippines was relegated to among the world's poorest and most indebted nations, precipitating an exodus of millions of Filipinos in search of employment and better life across all corners of the world. By now, not only South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, but also Singapore and Malaysia overtook it, with Thailand and Indonesia rapidly closing their development gap with the Philippines -- and eventually surpassing it. The Philippines' humiliating decline in the second half of the 20th century has instilled a deep sense of frustration and suspicion towards the country's inept ruling class, who never missed an opportunity to ensure their own wellbeing at the expense of the impoverished masses and the (shrinking and overtaxed) middle class. After the euphoric ouster of the Marcos regime in 1986, the Southeast Asian country largely reverted back to the ""elite democracy"" of the 1950s and 1960s, where political dynasties, oligopolistic industries and a privileged few swallowed the country's wealth and dominated its key economic sectors and political offices. In the past five years, however, the Aquino administration has instilled some measure of hope in the hearts of the Filipino nation. Despite all its mishaps, many people continue to relish the broadly constructive legacy of the incumbent government, which has brought about years of robust economic growth and sustained, albeit lopsided, anti-corruption initiatives. The Right One A commonly heard complaint among many middle class and educated Filipinos is the difficulty of choosing the next Filipino president among the likely candidates, who will soon officially register their bid for top office. None of the leading candidates seem to encapsulate the aspirations of the Philippines' upwardly mobile citizens, who are desperate to revive the Southeast Asian nation's fortunes. They want a leader who combines political will with integrity, experience and competence. But, as one veteran Filipino journalist observes, all three leading candidates, Vice President Jejomar Binay, Senator Grace Poe and Interior Secretary Mar Roxas are yet to prove whether they are fit for presidency. Binay, who not long ago was considered as the runaway winner, is confronting at least four separate plunder charges, currently being processed by the Office of the Ombudsman. He has dismissed all the allegations as purely politically-motivated, but his declining numbers reflect growing public suspicion even though he is yet to be held guilty by a court of law. As the former mayor of the Philippines' financial hub (Makati), Binay has constantly emphasized his administrative credentials, claiming that if he becomes the president he can expand the existing generous (and controversial) welfare system in Makati City to the entire country. But as prominent Filipino economist Solita Collas-Monsod points out, ""Makati's revenues -- from 62,000 business enterprises -- is not replicable anywhere,"" so obviously the city's generous welfare is at best a special case. The challenge for any Filipino president is to enhance the country's weak tax effort, which means going after fat cats that have exploited loopholes in the system, so that it can provide better basic services across the country. All Filipino presidents have fallen short of ensuring they effectively and efficiently tax their populations, especially the powerful rich. Without sufficient revenues, no government can properly operate and serve the citizens. As for enormously popular Poe, who is yet to fully warm up her seat in the Philippine Senate, she doesn't have, to put it mildly, a very extensive track record in government. Though seen as squeaky-clean by most people, the experience factor is a glaring gap in her resume. Moreover, she is also confronting a tricky legal battle over her eligibility to run for office. Even if she overcomes the legal hurdle (on whether she has fulfilled the residency requirements), Poe confronts a political controversy over her past decision (which she reversed late on) to renounce her Filipino citizenship in favor of an American one. Hard Choices Then you have Aquino's anointed successor, Wharton-graduate Mar Roxas, who has an extensive track record in government, having served in both chambers of the Philippine legislature and heading three different ministries (Trade and Industry, Transportation and Communications and Interior and Local Government). By far, he has the most diverse and extensive experience among the leading candidates. During his younger years, when he was an investment banker, he played a role in the financing/ascent of iconic ventures such as the Discovery Channel and Jollibee, Asia's fast-food powerhouse. As the head of the Department of Trade and Industry, he played a key role in establishing the Philippines as a Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) hub, which is set to generate as much as $48 billion by 2020. Similar to Senator Poe, he is also largely seen as squeaky clean. Yet, he is the weak link among the three leading candidates, having consistently struggled in surveys. There are at least two reasons for this. First of all, he hasn't had a stellar track record in his capacity as the head of the departments of transportation and communications (DOTC) as well as interior and local government (DILG) in recent years. He has been blamed for, whether justifiably or not, the government's unimpressive response to a myriad of crises and lack of a major overhaul in the country's communication infrastructure. Second, his bourgeoisie background, hailing from one of the Philippines' most elite bloodlines, seems to have undermined his appeal to the broader masses, who feel more connection with Poe (daughter of the late action star, Fernando Poe) and Binay, who has leveraged his rags-to-riches life story. Intent on improving his numbers, Roxas has made the (right) decision to reemphasize his more stellar track record as the man of trade and economy, ""Mr. Palengke"". (Back in August, this was actually my unsolicited advice during a television interview on Bottomline with Boy Abunda). We are yet to see whether this strategy will improve his weak numbers in recent surveys. Earlier calls for a Roxas-Poe tandem (against Binay) seem to have hit the cul-de-sac, so this means Roxas and Poe will be splitting votes of those who are determined to have a corruption-free leader in the top office, adding more unpredictability to the outcome of the race. What is clear, however, is that all three candidates are yet to prove their mettle. The Philippines needs a person of integrity, intellect, experience and political will in office if it wants to stand any chance of reviving its fortunes. Hopefully, the voters will have a better idea in coming months."
