Karl Lagerfeld is certainly not known for his restraint when it comes to language, and the fashion designer was particularly candid when describing Pippa Middleton in recent marks. What's the big diss?According to The Sun, Lagerfeld reportedly slammed the younger Middleton while praising her sister, Kate: Kate Middleton has a nice silhouette and she is the right girl for that boy. I like that kind of woman, I like romantic beauties. On the other hand, her sister struggles. I don't like the sister's face. She should only show her back.Lagerfeld essentially called Pippa a ""butter face,"" a slang term for a woman who has a killer body but her face is not as attractive. Ouch. ""It’s not enough for sibling rivalry that Kate married an actual prince, now Pippa, has to be slammed by the head of a fashion empire for having the wrong face?"" wrote BBC America's Fraser McAlpine. ""Christmas dinner at the Middleton house is going to be awkward this year.""Pippa might have caught the world's attention with her perfect derrière at the Royal Wedding, but she has since become an international style icon whom Usher wanted as the face of his new lingerie line, according to Styleite. Middleton is not the only beauty Lagerfeld has slammed. In February, the 78-year-old criticized singer Adele for being ""too fat."":""The thing at the moment is Adele. She is a little too fat, but she has a beautiful face and a divine voice,"" he told Metro. Lagerfeld does, however, have an affinity for Victoria Beckham. The Sun reports that the Chanel mastermind said: ""That body, after four children. There are not so many who have a body like that. She is very disciplined. We have the same eating habits. We did a full fashion shoot with her styled as Coco Chanel in less than three hours.""Remaining untouched by Karl's insidious jabs, however, is the behind of one Duchess Kate Middleton, as Lagerfeld waxed rhapsodic about Catherine's rump during Diamond Jubilee coverage.See more of Karl's Krazy Quotes below..."

In this case, it's the taxes America's victorious athletes can expect to pay when they return from the games.Medals and prize money are both subject to income tax, according to the Americans for Tax Reform. “It’s no different from winning Wheel of Fortune or the lottery,"" Alex Knight, a tax partner at Atlanta’s Habif, Arogeti & Wynne, told Reuters.A gold medal, which is worth $650, according to CNN, could cost athletes about $236 in taxes. While a bronze metal, which is worth $5, could only cost an athlete $2 in taxesThe real bite, however, will be taxes taken out of Olympians' cash bonuses.The U.S. Olympic Organizing Committee will award London champions $25,000 for a gold medal, $15,000 for silver and $10,000 for bringing home a bronze, Reuters reports. At a 35 percent income tax rate, bronze medalists will owe the IRS a total of $3,500, silver medalists will owe $5,250 and top finishers will be liable for $$8,750, according to Americans for Tax Reform. Of course, many high-profile athletes will also come home to lucrative sponsorships offers, also all taxable. In 2008, Michael Phelps earned a $1 million bonus from Speedo, which he donated to charity, NBC News reports. This summer, Phelps' teammate Ryan Lochte could earn even more from ads for Gatorade, Gillette and others.But American athletes aren't the only Olympians vying for the gold -- or big prize money.Though Malaysia has never won a gold medal in an Olympic Games, Andrew Kam, the owner of a gold mine and the Kuala Lumpur Racket Club, will award a 12.5 kilogram (27.5 pound) gold bar (market worth $630,000) to any badminton player who earns the top spot.A recent Yahoo! Finance story also notes that during the 2010 Winter Olympics, Russians received $135,000 for gold medals and $54,000 for bronze.There had been controversy leading up to London Games regarding Britain's stringent tax laws, which ordinarily take a large cut of the global income of any international athlete competing on its soil. The policy has led some athletes, including golfer Sergio “El Nino” Garcia and tennis star Rafael Nadal, to abstain from competing in British tournaments.Worried the policy would discourage participation from Olympic superstars like sprinter Usain Bolt, who has previously criticized the law, British taxing authorities agreed to an exemption for London 2012 Olympic athletes.Correction: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated how much medal winners could be taxed on their prize money. At a 35 percent income tax rate, bronze medalists would owe the IRS $3,500, silver medalists would owe $5,250 and gold medalists would owe $8,750.UPDATE: Senator Marco Rubio (R- Fla.) introduced a bill to Congress on Wednesday that would exempt Olympic winners from taxes on prizes received at the London games."

That could mean it's a decent time to buy them.Wall Street's optimism about the stock market is the lowest it has been since at least 1985, according to a research note on Wednesday by Bank of America's stock strategist Savita Subramanian. The bank measures market agita by tallying how much stock strategists are recommending their clients buy stocks.In the Bank of America chart at the bottom of this post, you can plainly see that sentiment has absolutely plunged this year. Stock-market strategists are almost always bullish on the stock market, in part because if nobody is buying stocks, then there's not much point in having stock-market strategists, is there? They'd have to go home and sit on their couches. But today, these same strategists are so spooked by the European debt crisis and the fiscal cliff and whatever else -- Obama, or something -- that they are recommending clients sell stocks, more than they did even during the financial crisis or the dot-com bubble bursting or after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Typically, you're going to get some pretty good bargains in stocks when you've got so little competition for them, Subramanian writes. She would be one of the dwindling breed of bullish strategists: ""Given the contrarian nature of this indicator, we are encouraged by Wall Street's lack of optimism.""Speaking of contrarian indicators, on Tuesday Pimco founder Bill Gross, manager of the world's biggest bond mutual fund, declared, ""The cult of equity is dying."" He warned that carnival barkers promising you annual returns of 6 percent to 7 percent every year in stocks were lying to you, that you should get those people out of your lives immediately. This is the same Bill Gross that predicted interest rates would soar last year (spoiler: they didn't) and then put his money where his mouth was, taking a big hit to his fund's performance and his reputation in the process.Gross's stock-market pronouncement, too, sparked immediate contrarian glee and derision among stock-market fans like Wharton finance professor Jeremy Siegel, who apparently knifed a perma-smile into face, Joker-style, years ago. To him, it is always time to buy stocks.For once, he might be right. The fact that everybody hates stocks is indeed a healthy sign for stocks, reminiscent of the infamous BusinessWeek magazine cover in 1979 braying of ""The Death Of Equities,"" not long before the start of a 16-year bull market.If you prefer your investment decisions to be influenced by something a little more serious than a magazine cover or a few talking heads, you could do worse than this chart of corporate stock prices relative to the amount of profit that companies produce, posted on Tuesday by Berkeley economics professor Brad DeLong. It, too, is at its lowest level in history, a history going back more than a hundred years. Typically, that means higher prices, and better returns, are ahead. And with bonds paying next to nothing in yield, stocks look even more attractive.""[I]t is hard to see how stocks can return less than 5%/year over the next decade,"" DeLong wrote. ""And in an environment in which you have to pay the Treasury 0.6% per year to watch your real value over the next decade, that is a very attractive expected return.""Before we get too carried away, it is worth remembering that stocks kept falling for another three years after that BusinessWeek cover. If you're buying stocks today, you may be in for a rough ride. Strategists are often clueless, but they're not wrong to worry about Europe or the fiscal cliff. The global economy probably needs some more time to recover from the credit bubble and bust of the past couple of decades. Investors, meanwhile, are not wrong to be cautious about leaping into a stock market that has apparently been taken over by robots on PCP.Henry Blodget of Business Insider, while excoriating Gross for some mistakes in his analysis, actually agrees with Gross's point that stocks are going to put up some lame numbers for a while. He says they'll do so because stocks are still expensive relative to their long-term average, corporate profits are still too close to record highs and dividends are still historically low.All of that is true. And late summer is probably not a great time to buy stocks anyway. Better to wait until the usual September/October panic, when everybody will really, truly hate stocks forever, amen. But with interest rates at nearly nothing, if you want to do something with your money beside stick it in a mattress -- which, nothing wrong with that, I guess -- then mediocre stock returns start to look pretty good.Extreme Bearishness.egg on Aviary."

Study participants given caffeine scored better on tests for movement than people who were given a placebo, the McGill University researchers found.""Although the results do not suggest that caffeine should be used as a treatment in Parkinson's disease, they can be taken into consideration when people with Parkinson's are discussing their caffeine use with their neurologist,"" Dr. Michael Schwarzschild, M.D., Ph.D., of Massachusetts General Hospital, who wrote an editorial that accompanied the new study, said in a statement. The researchers split up 61 people with Parkinson's disease into two groups. One group took a placebo pill, while the other took a 100 milligram caffeine pill twice a day for a three-week period, then a 200 milligram caffeine pill twice a day for a three-week period. (The amount of caffeine in the pills was the same as about two to four cups of coffee.) After the six weeks, the researchers had all of the study participants take a test for the severity of their disease. The people who took the caffeine pills scored five points better on the test than those who took the placebo. ""This is a modest improvement, but may be enough to provide benefit to patients. On the other hand, it may not be sufficient to explain the relationship between caffeine non-use and Parkinson's, since studies of the progression of Parkinson's symptoms early in the disease suggest that a five-point reduction would delay diagnosis by only six months,"" study researcher Dr. Ronald Postuma, M.D., M.Sc., of McGill, said in a statement. Coffee has also been shown in previous studies to lower the risk of Parkinson's. The Telegraph reported on a review of studies on coffee and Parkinson's, showing that overall, drinking anywhere from two or three cups of coffee a day can decrease by the risk of Parkinson's disease by 25 percent. And Reuters reported on a study in 2010 that suggested a specific gene may play a part in this decreased risk for some people.

You have finally met the man of your dreams and are engaged to be married.  Before you start booking the caterer, photographer or band, you better first make sure that your groom-to-be will be able to show up for your fairytale wedding.What happens if Mr. (or Ms. Right) is not a U.S. citizen? Unless you are planning on moving abroad, you better quickly figure out a way to keep your betrothed in the United States legally.  Follow these 10 tips when preparing for the green card process and you'll have a head start:1. Pull together some biographical information including the names, dates and places of birth of your parents, your places of residence for the last five years and your employer's address. This information provides a biographical sketch of your life and will be required in the application process.2. Living together makes a difference. If you live together already, make sure that the lease/deed is in both of your names. If you elect not to live together before the wedding, plan to do so as soon as you are married and again make sure that the lease/deed is in both of your names. Co-habitation shows that you share a life together and that you entered into your marriage in good faith.3. As soon as you move in together, put all bills into both of your names (cable, gas and electric, water, cell, etc). Doing so garners third party endorsement of your life together and shows a couple's financial collaboration to pay their bills.4. Once you begin receiving mail that is addressed to you as a couple, set some aside for documentation of your co-habitation and proof of residence.   5. Prepare photo albums of your life together such as dates, vacations, wedding, holidays spent together, etc. This builds a narrative of your life together and supports the notion that you're marrying for love and not strictly to obtain a visa for a friend.6. Once you are married, it is smart to open joint bank accounts and credit card accounts. Comingling your money is essentially 'putting your money where your mouth is' in the eyes of the government. It is extremely unlikely that two people simply trying to find a shortcut to a visa would take this drastic step.   7. Just like letters of recommendation for applying to schools or jobs, it helps to have close friends or relatives write testimonials that they know you as a couple. Having people vouch for your personal character as well as your life together also helps in ruling out marriage-for-visa scams.8. Make sure that you have original copies of your and your fiancé's birth certificates, divorce decrees (if either of you were married before), or birth certificates of any children you have together. Original copies are necessary for fraud prevention as copies or scans of official documents can be doctored or fabricated.9. Make sure you have filed your U.S. taxes for the last three years. Paying your taxes shows that you are a law-abiding citizen. Paying your taxes illustrates genuine residence in the community and that you are publicly known to the government.10. Being employed makes things much easier. As the U.S. citizen, being gainfully employed precludes you from additional steps, such as obtaining a joint sponsor, which will be done for financial reasons in the absence of employment.This is just a list to get you started. The immigration service has a tough job to do sorting through all of the marriage applications they receive each year, and approval or denial differs on a case by case basis. Immigration looks at each application to figure out whether the couple got married for ""love"" or if you are doing your friend a favor to get him a green card (or worse -- you are being paid to get him a green card)."

Because I wanted to have the power to make a difference in the world – I wanted to have a voice that would be heard.""She's well on her way. Summers, a 27-year-old blonde from Nottingham, England, is known in the British tabloids as the girl of many surgeries, having spent somewhere between £30,000 and £60,000 on cosmetic procedures. But one procedure in particular is landing her back in headlines: a seriously botched lip job.After receiving a £200 lip injection, the Mirror writes, Summers lips expanded to four times their normal size. She told the newspaper, ""I looked in the mirror and screamed. All I could see was a monster looking back at me.""The result, seen in Summers' Instagram pics below, was pretty bad. Worse than the mere ""trout pout"" that many celebs sport, Summers' lips ballooned. (Hey, at least it wasn't her butt?) Now Summers may have finally found her calling, her way to make a difference in the world: warning other women against bad plastic surgery. She tweeted today, ""Hope my lip story will help other girls a bit and warn them that they must be careful !""We should say so. Unfortunately, Summers' lips land her in our unofficial ""Plastic Surgery Disasters"" Hall of Fame, below. But do even the scariest cautionary tales persuade women (and men) from going under the knife? In the U.S., cosmetic surgery numbers increased from 2010 to 2011, with over 1 million surgical procedures performed (and that doesn't count Botox, Restylane, etc).

Begin by creaming the butters and sugars for the cookies. Beat in the egg and vanilla. In a small bowl mix together your flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Mix into the creamed butter and sugars. Mix in the oats and stir until combined. Drop teaspoonfuls (or use a small cookie scoop) of dough onto a parchment lined baking sheet. Make a criss-cross with a fork to flatten the cookies. Bake for 10 minutes and allow to cool. When cookies are completely cooled, flip half of them over. Spread with a spoonful of Nutella (how much you use is totally up to you) and then top with the remaining cookies."
