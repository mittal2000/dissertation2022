0,WELLNESS,"Alcohol Is A Bigger Danger To Health And Society Than Marijuana, Americans Say",Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alcohol-vs-marijuana_us_5b9df5d9e4b03a1dcc8f9167,"At the same time, ""not all abuse and dependency is created equal,"" as the authors of Marijuana Legalization: What Everyone",2014-04-03,"File - This Dec. 31, 2013 file photo shows partygoers smoking marijuana during a Prohibition-era themed New Year's Eve party celebrating the start of retail pot sales, at a bar in Denver. Colorado voters still support the state law that legalized recreational marijuana, but most believe it is hurting the image of the state, according to a new poll released Monday, Feb. 10, 2014. The Quinnipiac University Poll found that 51 percent of voters overall believe the measure is bad for the state's reputation, while 38 percent see it as a net positive. (AP Photo/Brennan Linsley, file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9df5d92200008300d9d497.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By a wide margin, Americans believe that alcohol is more dangerous to a person's health and to society in general than marijuana, according to a Pew study released Wednesday. When asked whether marijuana or alcohol would be more harmful to personal health, if marijuana were as widely available as alcohol, 69 percent of Americans said alcohol is more dangerous, while only 15 percent said that marijuana is more dangerous. Fourteen percent said both or neither are more dangerous. Respondents showed more trepidation when asked to consider marijuana's potential effects on society as a whole, but a strong majority still believed that alcohol is the more harmful substance. Sixty-three percent of those polled said alcohol is more dangerous, with 23 percent saying marijuana is more dangerous and 11 percent responding that both or neither are more harmful.Here's a look at the data breakdown from Pew:From heart disease to liver disease to elevated cancer risks, excessive alcohol consumption can indeed be devastating to a person's overall health. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are roughly 88,000 deaths attributable to alcohol use each year in the United States. In 2006, the CDC reported that there were 1.2 million emergency room visits and 2.7 million physician office visits due to excessive alcohol use.Studies have also shown cannabis to be far less addictive than alcohol, and even caffeine. That's not to say that marijuana isn't always habit-forming: Between four and nine percent of regular pot users can develop dependence on the drug, according to a frequently cited survey supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse. That's compared to about 15 percent of drinkers who develop a dependence for alcohol.At the same time, ""not all abuse and dependency is created equal,"" as the authors of Marijuana Legalization: What Everyone Needs to Know write. The authors of the 2012 book point out that while some heavy marijuana users do experience symptoms of clinical dependency and feel discomfort or withdrawal when trying to quit, kicking a pot addiction doesn't lead to the same type of intense, dangerous physical and psychological pain that often accompanies alcohol, nicotine or heroin dependency.Alcohol has been found to be more lethal than many other commonly abused substances, according to a study from American Scientist. Just 10 times the recommended serving of alcohol can lead to death, while a marijuana user would have to consume 20,000 to 40,000 times the amount of THC in a joint in order to be at risk of a fatal dose, according to a 1988 ruling from the Drug Enforcement Administration.Of course, marijuana is not harmless. Excessive use can lead to respiratory discomfort, although the drug itself has not been linked to lung damage. And while smoking marijuana is a common way to ingest the drug, there are a number of other methods of delivery that allow users to minimize or avoid potential harm to the lungs, including consuming high-potency cannabis-infused edibles or using a vaporizer, which eliminates much of the heated marijuana smoke. Among people prone to the development of psychosis, research has shown that smoking pot can lead to an earlier onset of the disorder. And there's understandable concern about adolescent marijuana use and its effects on the developing brain.Still, in at least 10,000 years of human consumption, there have been no documented deaths as a result of marijuana overdose. At the societal level, a report from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism showed that alcohol is a much more significant factor when it comes to violent crime in the U.S., suggesting that 25 to 30 percent of violent crimes are linked to alcohol use. The journal Addictive Behaviors noted more than a decade ago that ""alcohol is clearly the drug with the most evidence to support a direct intoxication-violence relationship,"" and that ""cannabis reduces likelihood of violence during intoxication."" THC, the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis associated with the ""high"" sensation, may even decrease ""aggressive and violent behavior"" in chronic users, a study from the National Academy of Sciences found.A recent study from researchers at the University of Texas at Dallas looked at states that have legalized medical marijuana and found that not only does legalization for medical use cause no increase in crime, it may actually reduce the incidence of some violent crimes, including homicide.Public opinion on marijuana, and much scientific research, could not be further from the federal government's opinion on the plant. Official federal policy still considers cannabis to be among ""the most dangerous drugs of all the drug schedules with potentially severe psychological and physical dependence,"" alongside substances like heroin and LSD.""At this point, it's astonishing that anyone still thinks marijuana is more harmful than alcohol,"" Mason Tvert, communications director for marijuana policy reform group the Marijuana Policy Project, told The Huffington Post. ""Only on a flat earth experiencing no climate change is alcohol the safer substance. The folks working to maintain marijuana prohibition need to take a good, hard look at the evidence surrounding these two products and ask themselves why they prefer adults use the one that causes far more damage to the consumer and society.""""If the goal is to maximize public health and safety, why would anyone want to prohibit adults from making the safer choice?"" Tvert went on. ""It would be like an environmentalist fighting to prevent the proliferation of electric cars."""

They are different sides of the same coin. However, either side you are on, when the exchange is off it can be draining and negatively impact your energy and mental state. Even when you are overtaking it has a diminishing effect on your power and impact.Specifically in terms of anxiety, stress and even feelings of suppression in the workplace an unbalanced exchange can be at play. Whether it be not enough pay, putting in too many hours, or an interpersonal situation with a boss or colleague.Find out where you are in terms of healthy energy exchange by answering the questions below.On a scale of 1 to 5 measure answer each of the questions below. 1: Very Low 2: Low 3: Moderate or Neutral 4: High 5: Very High1. How well do you feel you are compensated monetarily for your work?2. How well do you feel you are compensated in appreciation and praise for your work?3. How well do you take care of yourself (proper nutrition, regular exercise, and doctor visits) in relation to your work?4. How well are you able to replenish the energy you put into your work during off hours?5. How rewarding in terms of experience, exposure, and training do you find your work?6. How rewarding in terms of creativity, personal interest, and genuine interest do you find your work?7. How well is your work aligned with your natural and developed talents, gifts, and skills?Add up the total for all of your answers. For example if you chose 4 for every question, your total would be 28.Under 21: Very Low Exchange If you scored below 21 your exchange with your work is probably slowly (or quickly) draining you. If it is a job that you feel you need or want to keep for some time while you reach certain financial goals be intentional with the energy you spend here. First, shifting the perspective to an empowering context by being grateful for what the experience does provide. A little bit of gratitude opens doors for better exchange. Look for ways to align your personal interests and skills with your work -- ask for new responsibilities or take on a new project. Always make your personal well being (nutrition, exercise, and personal care) a priority. Do something that enriches and rejuvenates you on your breaks. Watch the exchange get better and better each day!21-27: Moderate Exchange If you scored between 21-27 your exchange is pretty good. You may not be doing cartwheels to the office each morning (maybe you are) but you see the value, feel appreciated, and are able to get your basic needs out of your work. To further improve this experience look at where you scored less than a 4 above, and ask yourself what would it take to move the scale to the right. Asking for a raise, making a lunch/workout break a priority, having a conversation with team mates to create a new level of understanding and appreciation. In this range you are in a good place and have perspective and leverage to make it better. Keep up the good work!28-35: Very Healthy Exchange If you scored, between 28-35, congratulations! You have a very healthy exchange with your work. You may even love and enjoy it. Be grateful and celebrate where you are. It's not an easy thing to achieve and you probably went through some tough days where the exchange felt off to get here. It may feel like a day to day process to maintain, and it is. Know that it's possible with clear intentions and communication. You're a model for healthy exchange at work!"

4,WELLNESS,Why 'Mentally-Ill Soldier' Reporting On Fort Hood Shooting Was Sloppy Journalism,"Mark Joyella, Contributor

The U.S. Institute of Medicine recommended on Friday, July 13, 2012 that soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan be screened for post-traumatic stress disorder at least once a year and that federal agencies conduct more research to determine how well the various treatments for PTSD are working. (AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9df6072000004e00fe2a0f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Why do people with mental health issues stay closeted, quiet, and in so many cases untreated? Well, for an answer, all you had to do was watch news coverage of the shooting Wednesday afternoon at Fort Hood, Texas. As the chaotic not again, not here storyline began to recede into the background, and the could it be terror/second shooter reports (as many who remained cautiously restrained in the early going had predicted) were discounted, a familiar line of questioning and theorizing began to rise almost inevitably, weaving ever-so-quietly-yet-insistently into the on-air chatter: The shooter, a soldier, was deranged.When Lt. Gen. Mark Milley appeared before the cameras late Wednesday night, he shared a variety of facts about the suspect in the case: He was a soldier, he'd served four months in Iraq in 2011, and he was married with family in the Killeen, Texas area. Gen. Milley also revealed the shooter had been under evaluation at Fort Hood for possible PTSD, having complained of a traumatic brain injury. He also had received treatment for anxiety and depression -- and was on medication (which has been reported today to be Ambien, a prescription sleeping medication). Fair enough. Had Gen. Milley added one more fact -- say, that the suspect attended an off-post mosque -- I assure you the conversation would have ramped up to ferocious speed along the lines of nexus to terrorism. That, of course, did not happen.Here's what did happen, though, resulting in a flurry of anger among advocates for the mentally ill, joined by many working to support veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Lacking that small fact that could have provided a route into MH370-class conjecture on fundamentalism, terrorism and jihad, journalists jumped on the next most tempting morsel in the highly-limited fact pool: PTSD and mental health. As early as 8:27 p.m., The New York Daily News was off and running, tweeting, ""UPDATE: Mentally ill soldier kills 3, self, wounds 16 at Fort Hood.""Factual? Perhaps. Fair? Not in the least. Consider what that tweet might have looked like had the suspect been identified, as in the case of the previous Fort Hood shooter, as Muslim. Would the Daily News have tweeted -- merely four hours after the shooting -- ""UPDATE: Muslim soldier kills 3?""Again, factual, but clearly, that headline would have sent a subtle but unmistakeable message: Muslim. Terrorist. Now, as it turned out in the case of Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, as the Daily News itself noted just this week, ""The psychiatrist became a radicalized Muslim while he was serving in the military, unleashing his fury during a 2009 shooting rampage that left 13 dead and 32 injured.""But that's absolutely not what the early coverage of the 2009 Fort Hood shooting went. Reporters and editors, wary of accusations of hostility or insensitivity, included the key fact of the accused's name, but never ran with it toward an explosive suggestion that hey, he's Muslim, right, so could this shooting be terrorism? NBC News, back in November of 2009, waited until the tenth paragraph of a story on the shooting to note, ""The Associated Press, quoting federal law enforcement officials, said Hasan had come to their attention at least six months ago because of Internet postings that discussed suicide bombings and other threats. The officials said they were still trying to confirm that he was the author.""The facts, important as we would later learn, are in the story. But they don't sit in the lede. NBC included other possibly-significant facts, like reports the shooter had been upset over a workplace issue, which could also have proven to be the cause of the shooting spree. Jihad had no business -- then -- in the lede or the headline, which did not read, ""Soldier Who Spoke of Suicide Bombings, Threats, Kills 12."" It was, ""Gunman kills 12, wounds 31 at Fort Hood.""If only the Daily News had been so careful.The words we choose as journalists matter. So does the emphasis we use, and the significance we assign to facts. Simply knowing that an Army general or any other official shared a ""fact"" does not make it, in itself, important. If it were, then a headline like, ""Chevy driving soldier kills 3"" would make sense. Instead, it's ridiculous. Driving a Chevy could be relevant -- even turn out to be the most important fact, explaining what led to a horrific attack. But in the first few hours, when more often than not, most facts turn out to be irrelevant or wrong, it's not worthy of inclusion in a headline or lede. And including the suspect's treatment for depression and anxiety, but not his treatment for, say, digestive upset or his need for corrective lenses, serves only to reinforce the stigma of mental illness.And by giving high prominence to the soldier's being evaluated (not even diagnosed) for PTSD, it's a huge disservice to the staggering numbers of American men and women returning from Iraq and Afghanistan with PTSD. The link, by the way, between PTSD and violence is at best shaky, and anyone who tells you a person being treated for depression and anxiety is prone to violence or mass shootings is an idiot. Simple as that.And yet, the potentially stigma-reinforcing and possibly irrelevant correlation between the shooting and the suspect's treatment for mental illness and perhaps PTSD wormed its way into cable news coverage and stories written about the killings at Fort Hood:A soldier being treated for mental health issues opened fire Wednesday at Fort Hood, killing three people and wounding 16 before fatally shooting himself at the same military base where 13 people died in a 2009 attack, authorities said. The gunman was being evaluated for PTSD, but a diagnosis had not been confirmed, said Lt. Gen. Mark A. Milley, the senior officer on the base. (Dallas Morning News)Yes, the last link is to the venerable New York Times, prompting Paul Rieckhoff, founder and executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, to tweet: ""Correlation does not imply causation. The @NYTimes should know that. And everyone else should take note.""These kinds of subtle connections, floated out in headlines, ledes and in repeated questions to experts in endless cable news coverage, result in reinforcement of stigma, and a lost opportunity to educate viewers and readers on what mental illness and PTSD really are. At a recent forum at a forum on mental illness and violence held in Washington last month by the Institute of Medicine, doctors and researchers warned about the ways incidents of mass shooting magnify misunderstanding about mental illness. ""The recent wave of mass shootings, often attributed to individuals with mental illness, should be placed in perspective, said Thomas Insel, M.D., director of the National Institute of Mental Health. ""Most people with mental illness are not violent, and most acts of violence are not committed by people with mental illness,"" said Insel in his keynote address. ""People with untreated psychotic illness are at increased risk of irrational behavior, including violence, especially directed at family and friends. This usually happens at the onset of illness and before diagnosis or treatment. However, once treatment starts, these people have no higher risk of violence than the general population and are more often victims of crime.""So yes, perhaps the shooter at Fort Hood did have PTSD. He may also have had any number of issues in his life that may or may not have led him to buy a gun, bring it to base, and kill. And yet news organizations including the Times thought there was enough reason to put a potential diagnosis of PTSD ahead of the facts of the shooting itself. What does that convey to readers? Again, consider the alternate lede: ""A soldier who attended a local mosque opened fire at Fort Hood on Wednesday."" That would never make the cut at the Times. But like the Daily News, mental illness does slip right into the first words of the first sentence, and it implies cause and effect. That's just plain sloppy journalism, and with millions of Americans facing mental health issues through the course of their lifetimes, and a generation of American men and women returning from wars suffering from these treatable illnesses and yet often resisting reaching out for help and ending their lives in suicide, we have a responsibility as journalists to be much more careful."

Photo by Jeff ByrnesPeruvian-born clothing designer Violeta Villacorta has been focusing on sustainable design since 1993. National and international magazines and the MOCA Geffen Museum in Los Angeles have showcased her signature bohemian eco-clothing collection, and she has dressed luminaries in the music and film industries. With ORG by vio, she combines her love for design, fine handcrafted adornment, the environment and indigenous culture by working in collaboration with Amazonian rainforest artisans.Villacorta started paying attention to global issues as a student at the United Nations International School (UNIS) in New York, which she describes as ""pro-creativity, pro-multiculturalism, pro-higher consciousness, pro-alternative thinking."" This background inspired her to create a sustainable handcrafted clothing line in 1993.Villacorta became involved with Amazon Watch in 2000 because she wanted to work with communities that had been affected by extractive industries such as gas, oil, timber, and gold mining. Amazon Watch, a leading nonprofit, has been working to protect the Amazon Basin and indigenous rights for more than two decades. Executive director Atossa Soltani is a ""primary inspiration,"" and Villacorta continued to contribute financially to the organization when she accepted a coveted role as senior designer at Patagonia, a position she held for six years. ""Peruvian Rainforest"" -- Designer Violeta Villacorta's friend and inspiration Atossa Soltani, founder and executive director of Amazon Watch, has been championing protection of the Amazon Basin and indigenous rights for two decades, leading successful campaigns to convince oil companies and international financial institutions to adopt stronger environmental and social standards. ""Atossa Soltani's dedication to the protection of the Amazon and its peoples is inspiring, powerful and unwavering."" - Violeta VillacortaVillacorta spent most of 2009 looking inward for inspiration. ""In the stillness, I listened for insights that would guide me to my true purpose and mission,"" she says. ""At the United Nations International School and the Fashion Institute of Technology, I was immersed in a richness of cultures and global awareness. Although I adopted a green consciousness early in my personal and professional life, it was no longer enough to create earth-friendly goods or live 'green.' I was moved to incorporate my values and skills in work with indigenous Amazon communities -- especially women.""The 2009 Bagua massacre, in which 33 Peruvians were killed and hundreds injured while peacefully protesting to protect their tribal land resources, triggered Villacorta's calling. She transcribed ""countless hours of footage that was so graphic and so painful to watch and hear for her friends at Amazon Watch and emerged even more determined to work directly with affected communities, ""within my creative realm, rather than through political activism."" ORG by vio was born.""I knew I needed to use my skills and somehow work for the Amazon jungle and work with these talented women,"" she says. ""The women are like family, like sisters. They have so much talent and so much to offer. To give them another alternative through the creative field was something that really interested me, and doing something creative with them that brings in money to the community is beautiful."" ""Violeta Villacorta with Amazon Women"" -- Designer Violeta Villacorta works with Yanesha women of the Palcazú Valley, Perú, a place she describes as ""a beautiful gem in the middle of the Peruvian rainforest,"" during the group's first workshop and the community's first bio jewelry collaboration. She describes the trip as a ""wonder-filled journey into Yanesha Territory.""Through ORG by vio, Villacorta shares tools that allow women in indigenous communities to maintain their traditions while creating income and livelihoods. She works hand in hand with the artisans, in person on location and virtually, emailing sketches and designs for collaborative projects and featuring their original works on her website and others.Her goal is to bring together communities that have been exploited. ""Extractive industries send in people with talents of persuasion who tell convincing stories,"" Villacorta explains. ""Some love the promises, and some don't want any part of it, and the friction can really tear the communities apart."" Villacorta believes that ""the creative force is a unifying energy.""In 2010, Villacorta began working on creative artisan projects with the Cofán or A'i people native to the Napo Province in northeast Ecuador and southern Colombia, whose ancestral land, community health and social cohesion have been severely damaged by several decades of oil drilling. In 2011, she visited the Awajún community in Peru and began collaborating with women artisans who create jewelry and accessories from seeds and other plant fiber materials.Blending elements from multiple cultures to create a look she calls ""bohemian chic,"" Villacorta loves the use of seeds from Amazonian jungle plants as well as plant fibers, managed wood and other plant materials. She is also looking forward to working with natural tree rubber. ""Violeta Villacorta Working on Designs"" -- Violeta Villacorta working on designs for Yanesha Bio Jewelry ProjectThe versatile ORG by vio collection can be worn with a wide variety of looks -- from jeans and a shoulder-baring top to simple, elegant ensembles by designers such as Eileen Fisher or edgy super-stylers such as Stella McCartney. Villacorta would love to see the collections, especially the higher-end jewelry, in stores such as Fred Segal, Anthropologie and Barney's. ""I'm a big-city girl,"" she says. ""If I lived in the jungle, I would miss the city, but I also love the Amazon, which is true jungle heaven. So, in a way, my designs are also a blend of these two jungles.""The beads used to create ORG by vio wearable art are actually seeds from flowering plants, bushes, trees and vines native to the Amazon rainforest. ""The plant world -- and jungles even more so -- is all about the spirit of abundance, so it is a designer's paradise,"" Villlacorta says. ""When you're looking for colors and shapes and sizes to work with, there's never a lack of choices.""""The communities swap and buy beads from each other all the time,"" Villacorta adds. ""Some beads have meanings, and others are just used because they are lovely to look at. The beautiful red bead with the little black dot is said to bring good luck, for instance. The one that looks like a deer's eye is given to people for protection."" ""Amazonian Seed Beads"" -- The beads used to create ORG by vio wearable art are actually seeds from flowering plants, bushes, trees and vines native to the Amazon rainforest. ""The plant world -- and jungles even more so -- is all about the spirit of abundance, so it is a designer's paradise. When you're looking for colors and shapes and sizes to work with, there's never a lack of choices."" - Violeta VillacortaSupporting women as they create something that brings respect and money to the community also helps create balance between genders. ""In the past, in many of these cultures, men and women worked side by side,"" she says, ""but once they were contacted by ministries, that really changed. Women were no longer respected and listened to.""During her meetings with the artisan communities, male leaders are still the most visible and vocal, Villacorta says, but women can attend, and when they do, they gravitate toward her. ""The entire project really started because the women could relate to and trust another woman,"" she says.As ORG by vio projects grow and thrive, Villacorta is witnessing something rare and remarkable. ""The young people are hungry for their roots,"" she says. ""They want to learn everything about their traditional artistry. They want to master the art and the craft of it. And while they learn they're also exposed to other precious traditional cultural concepts like shamanism and plant spirit, and they want to learn that too. More and more, they want to learn about the way of the jungle.""Elders, Villacorta says, are eager to pass on what they know. ""The elders are very happy that young people are interested in what they have to offer again,"" she says. ""They had been told that what they knew was not important any longer. No one wants or deserves to hear that."" She feels ""humbled and grateful"" to be part of rekindling multi-generational reconnection. ""Yanesha Artisans at workshop First Day, Yanesha Territory, Perú"" -- Violeta Villacorta and many other established designers find inspiration in indigenous cultures all over the world, and she believes they should get more credit. ""The cultures that conceived and developed these looks over hundreds, maybe thousands, of years seldom if ever receive any benefit from having inspired the designers. Many of these communities need our support."" - Violeta VillacortaEstablishing sustainable chains of trade with indigenous women is an ambitious challenge to take on anywhere in the world. In the Amazon rainforest, it's more like an anthropological jungle adventure movie, with a femme power protagonist and a colorful cast of women and girls hoping to heal and protect the paradise they live in and steward. Though Peruvian-born, Villacorta is still considered ""foreign"" -- thus suspect -- and must rely on complex, convoluted channels of introduction when searching for ethnic tribal partners. Her big heart, intelligent sincerity, and focus on collaborative-based progress has opened many doors. Despite the challenges, she remains passionate. ""When we align ourselves with our true purpose, all the pieces fall into place effortlessly and the real work begins,"" she says.

Photo by Jeff ByrnesPeruvian-born clothing designer Violeta Villacorta has been focusing on sustainable design since 1993. National and international magazines and the MOCA Geffen Museum in Los Angeles have showcased her signature bohemian eco-clothing collection, and she has dressed luminaries in the music and film industries. With ORG by vio, she combines her love for design, fine handcrafted adornment, the environment and indigenous culture by working in collaboration with Amazonian rainforest artisans.Villacorta started paying attention to global issues as a student at the United Nations International School (UNIS) in New York, which she describes as ""pro-creativity, pro-multiculturalism, pro-higher consciousness, pro-alternative thinking."" This background inspired her to create a sustainable handcrafted clothing line in 1993.Villacorta became involved with Amazon Watch in 2000 because she wanted to work with communities that had been affected by extractive industries such as gas, oil, timber, and gold mining. Amazon Watch, a leading nonprofit, has been working to protect the Amazon Basin and indigenous rights for more than two decades. Executive director Atossa Soltani is a ""primary inspiration,"" and Villacorta continued to contribute financially to the organization when she accepted a coveted role as senior designer at Patagonia, a position she held for six years. ""Peruvian Rainforest"" -- Designer Violeta Villacorta's friend and inspiration Atossa Soltani, founder and executive director of Amazon Watch, has been championing protection of the Amazon Basin and indigenous rights for two decades, leading successful campaigns to convince oil companies and international financial institutions to adopt stronger environmental and social standards. ""Atossa Soltani's dedication to the protection of the Amazon and its peoples is inspiring, powerful and unwavering."" - Violeta VillacortaVillacorta spent most of 2009 looking inward for inspiration. ""In the stillness, I listened for insights that would guide me to my true purpose and mission,"" she says. ""At the United Nations International School and the Fashion Institute of Technology, I was immersed in a richness of cultures and global awareness. Although I adopted a green consciousness early in my personal and professional life, it was no longer enough to create earth-friendly goods or live 'green.' I was moved to incorporate my values and skills in work with indigenous Amazon communities -- especially women.""The 2009 Bagua massacre, in which 33 Peruvians were killed and hundreds injured while peacefully protesting to protect their tribal land resources, triggered Villacorta's calling. She transcribed ""countless hours of footage that was so graphic and so painful to watch and hear for her friends at Amazon Watch and emerged even more determined to work directly with affected communities, ""within my creative realm, rather than through political activism."" ORG by vio was born.""I knew I needed to use my skills and somehow work for the Amazon jungle and work with these talented women,"" she says. ""The women are like family, like sisters. They have so much talent and so much to offer. To give them another alternative through the creative field was something that really interested me, and doing something creative with them that brings in money to the community is beautiful."" ""Violeta Villacorta with Amazon Women"" -- Designer Violeta Villacorta works with Yanesha women of the Palcazú Valley, Perú, a place she describes as ""a beautiful gem in the middle of the Peruvian rainforest,"" during the group's first workshop and the community's first bio jewelry collaboration. She describes the trip as a ""wonder-filled journey into Yanesha Territory.""Through ORG by vio, Villacorta shares tools that allow women in indigenous communities to maintain their traditions while creating income and livelihoods. She works hand in hand with the artisans, in person on location and virtually, emailing sketches and designs for collaborative projects and featuring their original works on her website and others.Her goal is to bring together communities that have been exploited. ""Extractive industries send in people with talents of persuasion who tell convincing stories,"" Villacorta explains. ""Some love the promises, and some don't want any part of it, and the friction can really tear the communities apart."" Villacorta believes that ""the creative force is a unifying energy.""In 2010, Villacorta began working on creative artisan projects with the Cofán or A'i people native to the Napo Province in northeast Ecuador and southern Colombia, whose ancestral land, community health and social cohesion have been severely damaged by several decades of oil drilling. In 2011, she visited the Awajún community in Peru and began collaborating with women artisans who create jewelry and accessories from seeds and other plant fiber materials.Blending elements from multiple cultures to create a look she calls ""bohemian chic,"" Villacorta loves the use of seeds from Amazonian jungle plants as well as plant fibers, managed wood and other plant materials. She is also looking forward to working with natural tree rubber. ""Violeta Villacorta Working on Designs"" -- Violeta Villacorta working on designs for Yanesha Bio Jewelry ProjectThe versatile ORG by vio collection can be worn with a wide variety of looks -- from jeans and a shoulder-baring top to simple, elegant ensembles by designers such as Eileen Fisher or edgy super-stylers such as Stella McCartney. Villacorta would love to see the collections, especially the higher-end jewelry, in stores such as Fred Segal, Anthropologie and Barney's. ""I'm a big-city girl,"" she says. ""If I lived in the jungle, I would miss the city, but I also love the Amazon, which is true jungle heaven. So, in a way, my designs are also a blend of these two jungles.""The beads used to create ORG by vio wearable art are actually seeds from flowering plants, bushes, trees and vines native to the Amazon rainforest. ""The plant world -- and jungles even more so -- is all about the spirit of abundance, so it is a designer's paradise,"" Villlacorta says. ""When you're looking for colors and shapes and sizes to work with, there's never a lack of choices.""""The communities swap and buy beads from each other all the time,"" Villacorta adds. ""Some beads have meanings, and others are just used because they are lovely to look at. The beautiful red bead with the little black dot is said to bring good luck, for instance. The one that looks like a deer's eye is given to people for protection."" ""Amazonian Seed Beads"" -- The beads used to create ORG by vio wearable art are actually seeds from flowering plants, bushes, trees and vines native to the Amazon rainforest. ""The plant world -- and jungles even more so -- is all about the spirit of abundance, so it is a designer's paradise. When you're looking for colors and shapes and sizes to work with, there's never a lack of choices."" - Violeta VillacortaSupporting women as they create something that brings respect and money to the community also helps create balance between genders. ""In the past, in many of these cultures, men and women worked side by side,"" she says, ""but once they were contacted by ministries, that really changed. Women were no longer respected and listened to.""During her meetings with the artisan communities, male leaders are still the most visible and vocal, Villacorta says, but women can attend, and when they do, they gravitate toward her. ""The entire project really started because the women could relate to and trust another woman,"" she says.As ORG by vio projects grow and thrive, Villacorta is witnessing something rare and remarkable. ""The young people are hungry for their roots,"" she says. ""They want to learn everything about their traditional artistry. They want to master the art and the craft of it. And while they learn they're also exposed to other precious traditional cultural concepts like shamanism and plant spirit, and they want to learn that too. More and more, they want to learn about the way of the jungle.""Elders, Villacorta says, are eager to pass on what they know. ""The elders are very happy that young people are interested in what they have to offer again,"" she says. ""They had been told that what they knew was not important any longer. No one wants or deserves to hear that."" She feels ""humbled and grateful"" to be part of rekindling multi-generational reconnection. ""Yanesha Artisans at workshop First Day, Yanesha Territory, Perú"" -- Violeta Villacorta and many other established designers find inspiration in indigenous cultures all over the world, and she believes they should get more credit. ""The cultures that conceived and developed these looks over hundreds, maybe thousands, of years seldom if ever receive any benefit from having inspired the designers. Many of these communities need our support."" - Violeta VillacortaEstablishing sustainable chains of trade with indigenous women is an ambitious challenge to take on anywhere in the world. In the Amazon rainforest, it's more like an anthropological jungle adventure movie, with a femme power protagonist and a colorful cast of women and girls hoping to heal and protect the paradise they live in and steward. Though Peruvian-born, Villacorta is still considered ""foreign"" -- thus suspect -- and must rely on complex, convoluted channels of introduction when searching for ethnic tribal partners. Her big heart, intelligent sincerity, and focus on collaborative-based progress has opened many doors. Despite the challenges, she remains passionate. ""When we align ourselves with our true purpose, all the pieces fall into place effortlessly and the real work begins,"" she says. ""I believe that the cooperation of people is an indispensable element of building sustainability and creating powerful opportunities and partnerships around the world.""ORG by vio stands for ""Organic Rainforest Goods (ORG)"" by ""Violeta & Indigenous Organizations (vio)."""
