0,IMPACT,Providing Free Storage Could Be Key To Ending Homelessness,Eleanor Goldberg,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/storage-ending-homelessness_n_5724610.html,,2014-08-27,"CHICAGO - APRIL 28: Glenn Manley, 69-years-old, originally from Kankakee, Illinois, pushes what he calls his 'home' along a street April 28, 2005 in Chicago, Illinois. Chicago is working on what is called a 10-year 'plan to end homelessness,' a program that favors permanent housing over shelters, hoping to assist the 'chronic,' or those on the streets for a length of time. When asked if he was homeless, Manley replied, 'no, not really. My home is right here' while pointing to his shopping cart full of his personal items. When asked how long he has been homeless, Manley said, 'quite a long time.'

It may require something as simple as a locker that can hold an individual’s basic belongings. One of the main issues homeless people face is one that has nothing to do with the usual suspects of mental illness, addiction or unemployment. Many people living on the streets are often unable to look for work during the day or risk sleeping in a shelter at night because of the burden of having to cart –- and guard -- every item they own at all times. ""When you’re literally homeless, you’re like a turtle that carries everything on his or her back,"" Michael Stoops, director of community organizing for the National Coalition for the Homeless, told CityLab. ""Which can be problematic if you're walking long distances or trying to work. There's always the danger of things being lost, stolen, or thrown away by police officers."" Seattle has pledged to offer 100 lockers for homeless people by the end of the year and San Diego has 270 bins. In 2012, Los Angeles paid for 500 of the 600 bins made available to homeless people by nonprofit group Central City East Assn.Just having a safe plastic box to store a license and some clothes can be invaluable. In 2011, San Diego opened its Transitional Storage Center -- which was part of a settlement deal after a group of homeless people’s belongings was wrongfully taken and destroyed, according to the group’s website.It currently offers 270 bins free of charge, which have freed up the city of 30,000 pounds of ""stuff,"" and is planning on expanding soon. Running the facility costs the city $1 a day per bin and it’s proven to fulfill its goals. Since opening, an estimated 100 homeless people have been able to gain employment and move off the streets, thanks to the center’s services. ""The storage center gave me freedom from worry and the ability to go to the library and seek employment,"" said D. May, a former client of the program. ""My job search has been successful. I will once again be a productive member of society.""In addition to giving people the mobility to look for jobs and go to medial and social service appointments, the free storage also ensures that the few precious items they’re holding onto remain safe.A common concern of homeless people is that going to shelters often means risking having their possessions stolen.“I spent most of my time homeless out on the street. It wasn't until the very end of my homelessness that I ended up in a shelter. And I found out that a lot of what I was afraid of was true,” David Pirtle, an advocate for homeless people who was once homeless himself, told NPR in 2012. “I had my shoes stolen, just like people said you get your shoes stolen.” Being relieved of the burden of carrying every last belonging around also restores a sense of dignity. Mark Horvath, a homeless activist who also once lived on the streets, said the first day he had to resort to hauling everything he owned in a shopping cart was “a low point of my life.”“I manhandled the cart over each curb for about a half a mile and I was exhausted,” Horvath wrote in a HuffPost blog last November. “It was very humiliating; people drove by laughing at me.” Government officials appreciate just how vital it is to have these systems in place. “The storage center has taken literally tons of objects and belongings off of our streets … and in some instances homeless individuals have been able to get jobs and other needed assistance because they were no longer having to lug all of their belongings with them,” San Diego Housing Commission President Richard C. Gentry said at a press conference in February. “It is a key element in our plan to try and end the cycle of homelessness, and moving people off the streets and into more productive, self-sufficient paths.” Like Us On Facebook   Follow Us On Twitter  "

In addition to seeing Kanye West, Pharrell Williams, John Mayer, Steve Aoki, Kendrick Lamr, and Iggy Azalea grace the stage during the Labor Day weekend event, concertgoers will also be able to participate in various interactive experiences including a new high-end dining experience through the “Budweiser 1876 Bistro.”Fans who are unable to attend the festival also have the opportunity to live stream each performance via the Made in America official site.As one would expect, managing a large scale, two-day, bi-coastal music festival can present a number of logistical and technical issues, all of which has added to the anticipation of this year’s gathering. “That’s what’s exciting about this year. And that’s what we feel is a unique fingerprint on this particular festival is the fact that it is bi-coastal this year, which unique of itself that it’s happening during the same weekend. Which as you can imagine, presents some logistical challenges for those of us who are working the festival itself,” Budweiser brand manager, Mike Thompson admitted to the Huffington Post. “But the idea is, we look at this as one festival that’s taking place on two different coasts, and half of our stage, and half of our audiences is separated by 2700 miles, but it’s one cohesive festival…we’ll do some live peek-ins and show some of the audience and make them experience what’s going on in Philadelphia and vice versa.”Looking ahead to future Made in America festivals, Thompson revealed the brand’s immediate plans to expand the length of the festival, as well as additional areas for artists to perform, and he didn’t rule out the idea of going from a bi-coastal festival to a global one.“Based on the success and demand, I guess the next step would be look at the opportunities to expanding the number of days,” he revealed. “Maybe we’re expanding the footprint and adding stages. Those are the things that we always talked about from the very beginning, when we were looking at the festival.“But I think the consumer will ultimately dictate the direction that the festival goes based on our abilities to deliver a good experience and create demand, because that experience is what people are looking for.” "
2,BLACK VOICES,Most New Yorkers Want To See Criminal Charges In The Death Of Eric Garner,Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eric-garner-poll-daniel-pantaleo-quinnipiac_n_5725328.html,,2014-08-27,"Demonstrators rally against police brutality in memory of Eric Garner on August 23, 2014 in Staten Island, New York. The New York City medical examiner's office ruled that Garner, the 43-year-old father of six, died from a chokehold and chest compressions while being arrested by the police on July 17, 2014. AFP PHOTO/Stan Honda (Photo credit should read STAN HONDA/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badfeda2400003100964e81.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- A majority of New Yorkers think criminal charges should be brought against police officer Daniel Pantaleo, the cop most directly involved in last month's death of Eric Garner on Staten Island, a new poll shows. According to a Quinnipiac poll released Wednesday, 64 percent of New York City voters would support brining charges against Pantaleo, while only 19 percent would oppose charges. When the numbers are broken down by race, 83 percent of black voters approve of charges being brought against Pantaleo, along with 50 percent of white voters. Similarly, 90 percent of black voters polled think there is “no excuse” for the way officers acted when arresting Garner, while 50 percent of white voters feel the same. Garner, a black 43-year-old father of six and grandfather of two, died on July 17 after Pantaleo put him into a banned chokehold during an arrest for selling untaxed cigarettes in the Tompkinsville section of Staten Island. A viral video of the incident shows Garner, who suffered from asthma, screaming “I can’t breathe” numerous times before his body goes limp. A medical examiner later ruled his death a homicide. Garner’s death has once again brought the relationship between the NYPD and the city’s minority communities into focus. Wednesday’s poll shows that 63 percent of voters think cops treat black New Yorkers tougher than they do white New Yorkers. When the numbers are broken down by race, 83 percent of black voters said cops were tougher on blacks, while 50 percent of white voters agreed. Meanwhile, 74 percent of voters think police brutality in New York City is a “very serious” or “somewhat serious” problem. That number is 96 percent among black voters. Yet the poll shows that despite their concerns about the NYPD, New Yorkers are still supportive of “Broken Windows” policing. Championed by NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, Broken Windows is a strategy of policing that targets low-level offenders -- such as people selling untaxed cigarettes -- in order to deter more serious crime. Sixty percent of New Yorkers -- with almost equal support along racial lines -- support police targeting low-level, quality-of-life crimes, while 61 percent of New Yorkers said they support “Broken Windows” policing. Even 56 percent of black voters support Broken Windows, according to the poll. “Our numbers say ‘Broken Windows’ is a good thing,” Maurice Carroll, the Quinnipiac poll’s assistant director, told The New York Post. “In the Garner case, they think the arrest was unjustified and the cop should be prosecuted.”“That sounds inconsistent and it probably is,” Carroll added, “but there’s no law that says you have to be consistent.”Priscilla Gonzalez, of Communities United for Police Reform, took issue with how the poll was conducted. “The issue isn’t whether New Yorkers want their quality of life issues addressed –- everyone deserves that –- or whether the police should enforce the law, but it is in how certain communities are unreasonably targeted for low-level offenses,” she said in a statement. She pointed to a NY Daily News analysis showing dramatic racial disparities in how low-level crimes were enforced. The paper reported that 81 percent of the 7.3 million New Yorkers who received summonses for petty violations between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. ""The discriminatory application of broken windows policing that only targets certain communities for enforcement of low-level infractions –- including the disproportionate use of arrests for summonsable offenses in certain communities –- is what must end in order to truly improve relationships between these same communities and the police,” Gonzalez said. Meanwhile, Staten Island district attorney Dan Donovan has said he’ll impanel a grand jury next month to decide whether to bring charges against Pantaleo and other officers involved in Garner’s death. Pantaleo has been stripped of his gun and badge, and is serving desk duty. Lawmakers and advocates have expressed concern over Donovan’s slow response to Garner’s death. It took Donovan more than a month to say he would convene the grand jury. Last week a group of state lawmakers called on Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) to appoint a special prosecutor to take over the case. Rev. Al Sharpton -- who organized a massive march for Garner in Staten Island on Saturday -- has said that the Department of Justice needs to take over prosecution of the case. "

Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) confirmed the answer in a new interview with People magazine.According to excerpts from the interview obtained in advance by the New York Post, the congresswoman recalled multiple male colleagues making disparaging comments about her body as she struggled with her weight after having a child.""You know, Kirsten, you're even pretty when you're fat,"" an unidentified Southern congressman told her in the House chamber.""Good thing you're working out, because you wouldn't want to get porky!"" another male colleague told her in the House gym, to which Gillibrand responded, ""Thanks, asshole."" Acknowledging that she was too heavy for her health, Gillibrand lost 50 pounds while she served in the House in 2009. But the comments followed her into the Senate the following year.Gillibrand said an older senator once grabbed her waist from behind and said, ""Don't lose too much weight now. I like my girls chubby."" It seems that Gillibrand's male colleagues could not make up their mind about her appearance. In 2010, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) referred to her as ""the hottest member"" of Congress at a fundraiser.The New York senator is not the first to point out sexism in the halls of Congress. When former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) made the infamous comment about women learning to ""control their libidos,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) told HuffPost Live that she hears comments like that from her male colleagues all the time. ""This is a statement so from the past that I'm almost embarrassed for him, but understand it doesn't stand out as anything unusual from what we hear our members say here,"" Pelosi said. ""You don't have a long enough show for me to go into what you hear around here from the members of Congress."""

He said Williams had never specifically asked him to do anything.Zubowsky acknowledged that she had taken gifts from Williams, including airplane flights and a $10,000 check as a wedding present.""Once we realized Jonnie himself was a criminal,"" she said, the check was returned.Williams was granted immunity to testify for the prosecution about what he described as a ""business relationship"" with the McDonnells, with gifts and loans in exchange for influence.April Niamtu, a friend of Maureen McDonnell, described her as ""very gullible"" and easily persuaded.Niamtu said the former first lady was a nervous person, always biting her fingernails and concerned about her lack of privacy at the governor's mansion.If convicted, the couple could spend 20 years in prison and face hefty fines. McDonnell's term as governor ended in January. (Editing by Ian Simpson and Mohammad Zargham)"

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d3de3c000020010df89e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Those of us working on political money issues have a fresh appreciation today for the old saying that politics makes for strange bedfellows. That's because Sen. Mitch McConnell, long known as a champion of big money in politics, has made a stunningly compelling case for a constitutional amendment that would allow Congress and the states to restore sensible limits on political spending. We appreciate his help and his clarity.By happy coincidence, the Senate will vote on just such a proposal next month, the Democracy for All Amendment (S.J. Res 19). Senators still undecided about the amendment should study Sen. McConnell's remarks carefully.As reported by The Nation and The Huffington Post, McConnell spoke in June to a roomful of ultra-rich political investors and voiced his delight at their collective success in unharnessing political money. ""The worst day on my political life"" was when then-President George W. Bush signed the McCain-Feingold law with its limits on independent political spending, he declared. He paid particular tribute to industrialists Charles and David Koch, the country's most prolific political spenders: ""I don't know where we'd be without you,"" he told them.Sen. McConnell called the Democracy for All Amendment radical; it is anything but. In a few sentences, it restores an understanding of the Constitution that was in place for at least a century until recently unraveled by the Roberts court. It affirms that money is not speech and that no one, however wealthy or powerful, has a constitutional right to spend unlimited sums to influence our elections.A poll conducted for CBS News in May found that 71 percent of Americans support reasonable limits on political spending. A survey this month in ""battleground"" states for this November's elections, including Sen. McConnell's home state of Kentucky, found 73 percent support a constitutional amendment. These are your radicals, Senator.McConnell argued that proposals to limit political spending are aimed at silencing critics of government. Singling out Common Cause, he accuses those who favor a system that pays for campaigns with a mix of public funds and small dollar donations from individuals of trying to elevate Democrats and defeat Republicans.Nonsense. The Democracy for All Amendment would protect the First Amendment; every citizen's right to express their views, however unpopular or unconventional, would remain fully intact. Corporations also would continue to speak; the amendment simply would permit sensible controls on how much they and individuals can spend to influence elections.As for public financing, Republicans routinely run and win using public funds in states with voluntary public financing systems. In my home state of Connecticut, GOP gubernatorial candidate Tom Foley has opted to run on public financing this year; Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer used her state's public financing system when she won in 2010. The ""clean elections"" or ""fair elections"" systems in these states encourage candidates of all parties to focus on issues important to the general public rather than the parochial concerns of a handful of funders.The real radicals are those who argue that their free speech rights are a license to use their wealth -- corporate or individual -- to drown out the voices of other Americans. They view the Citizens United decision, which invited corporations to spend freely on our elections, as having -- in Sen. McConnell's words -- ""leveled the playing field for corporations.""The American people know better."

Protesters took to the streets of the St. Louis suburb night after night, calling for change and drawing national attention to issues surrounding race and policing.

They have been articulated for years, in barbershops, bars, social media, various articles and blogs, by the everyday fan to the most celebrated scholars. But many still are misguided and inaccurate.The recent fatal shooting of Mike Brown in Ferguson, Mo., has hit all of us, including athletes. When a national tragedy occurs such as the case of Brown -- the young black unarmed teen who was shot and killed by Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson -- it affects everyone, especially those who have kids. Mike Brown was shot a total of six times -- twice in the head and four times in the arms -- a preliminary, private autopsy revealed.Many question how someone could be struck in the middle of their right palm unless their hands were up? In addition, why would a police officer shoot someone in the top of the head... and then leave him lying dead in the street for hours? Some view the shooting as a public execution.This is a parent's worst nightmare. Couple this with the apparent mishandling of the situation by the St. Louis Police Department. As I write this, a whole two weeks after Brown was killed, Officer Wilson has gone into hiding. His social media accounts have been deactivated. Wilson hasn't been charged with anything, but put on paid administrative leave in an undisclosed location.This has resulted in two weeks of unrest; police clash with demonstrators in what resembles a war zone in a foreign country; bully tactics by the St. Louis Police Department demonize the victim and attempt to justify the shooting with the release of an unrelated video in order to attack Brown's character.People are searching for answers. An entire community hasn't had the chance to breathe following the Eric Garner choking incident by the NYPD. Many are still healing from the death of Trayvon Martin, Jordan Davis and countless others. USA Today released statistics showing that a white police officer kills a black person nearly two times a week in the United States.Many black parents are forced to have ""The Talk"" with their kids at a much younger age than anticipated; how they will be viewed in society, how to react to the police when you are stopped (not if but when); how they will be treated if they commit a crime vs. if someone else commits a crime; how the world is simply not always a fair place.As President Barack Obama addressed the nation for the third time on the tragedy of Mike Brown's death, the violence that has occurred and the overall issues that need to be addressed -- which include excessive police force and the people's right to assemble peacefully -- he condemned those breaking the law, reassured them that he understood their frustrations, ensured that he was doing everything he could to bring about justice, and spoke to the overall issue: ""In too many communities, too many young men of color are left behind and seen only as objects of fear.""This tragedy did not fail to hit home for many athletes as well. For some reason, people seem to think that the problems and issues of society don't have the same effect on athletes. People seem to think that there is an imaginary bubble that we all live in that protects us from any harm. That simply is not the case. Countless athletes -- and entertainers, rappers, professionals, activists, authors, journalists -- stand in solidarity with Brown and the people of Ferguson, Mo.A group of players from the Washington Football Team (and, yes, I referred to them by that name for a specific reason -- out of respect to Native American people), in a show of solidarity before their preseason game against the Cleveland Browns, came through the tunnel with their hands up, referencing that Mike Brown reportedly had his hands raised in surrender when he was killed. Safety Brandon Meriweather said that the team's defensive backs decided to do this together as a group.""We just wanted everybody to know that we supported Michael and acknowledge what happened in Ferguson. It was all our idea, something we decided to do as a group just to show our support,"" Merriweather told USA Today Sports.Safety Ryan Clark said: ""Brown could have been any of us. That could have been any one of our brothers or cousins... When you get an opportunity to make a statement and be more than a football player, it's good.""Earlier this week, wide receiver Pierre Garcon posted a photo on Instagram of he and over a dozen other players from the Washington Football Team also with their hands up in the submission pose. He included the hashtags #handsUpDontShoot We are all #MikeBrown.Kobe Bryant tweeted a link to an ABC news story about racial tensions in Ferguson.Allen Iverson Tweeted this with an Instagram link of himself wearing a T shirt that said Mike Brown.The people who criticize an athlete ""tweeting"" support as being meaningless don't understand the power of social media. Kobe Bryant has 5.5 million followers. Allen Iverson has 780,000-plus followers on Twitter. With just a stroke of a button, they can send out a message to millions of people who are hanging on their every word. That's power.I asked two of my former teammates with the Washington Wizards, Larry Hughes and Jahidi White -- both of whom are from St. Louis -- how they feel.Larry Hughes:I feel our community's frustration. Even as a successful young black male there is an uneasiness in the presence of law enforcement. Growing up in this country, I know at anytime the situation can turn negative.Jahidi White:There is still this disconnect between young African-Americans and law enforcement that hasn't changed. There's this distrust between us and those who have sworn to ""PROTECT and SERVE US. The prevailing sentiment from law enforcement is that every individual that fits in our demographic should be viewed as dangerous and unlawful rather than the citizens that we are first and foremost. Most of the time we are not afforded the same kind of due process that is guaranteed to all under the constitution. The innocent until proven guilty clause very rarely applies to us. I feared for my life just like I know that Mike Brown feared for his staring down the barrel of the gun of the people who are sworn to keep us safe.I have a radio show on Washington DC's WPFW FM 89.3 with political and sportswriter Dave Zirin called The Collision, ""Where Sports And Politics Collide."" We had Syracuse legend Derrick Coleman and Kentucky Wildcat legend Derek Anderson on to discuss the Mike Brown situation.Derrick Coleman:They try to character assassinate our children and show them in a whole different light to make it justifiable and say this is why he got shot. Over some cigarillos? The police officer didn't even know anything about that.Derek Anderson:All these policeman can easily use a taser. If you're quick enough to pull a gun you can use a taser. You don't have to shoot anybody. If you and me are having a confrontation and you're bigger than me and I pull out a taser I can eliminate the situation. You won't die. I can easily eliminate any threat of you hurting me. The police can do that -- they choose to not do that and they are getting the backlash for it and it's going to continue to get worse. Something is going on bigger than what we are seeing. We just have to pay attention to it.A tragedy such as this doesn't escape athletes. Contemporary black athletes are capable of carrying on the tradition of their brave brothers and sisters before them who led their teams to victory on the field and led the way in challenging racial disunity and injustice in the world outside the athletic arena (all while potentially facing the petty and insipid criticism of reactionary media).Unfortunately, that criticism has come from all quarters, including sympathetic ones in television and in print. The New York Times columnist and author William C. Rhoden argued in his book, Forty Million Dollar Slaves, that contemporary athletes fail to speak out or otherwise act on issues of importance to their communities.He wrote:Now that they occupy a position where they can be more than symbols of achievement, where they can actually serve their communities in vital and tangible ways, while also addressing the power imbalance within their own from a position of greater strength, they seem most at a loss, lacking purpose and drive....The Black Athlete has abdicated their responsibility to the community with treasonous vigor.Let me first say that I enjoyed Rhoden's book and found it to be a very informative history of the black athlete in America. It touched on the unfortunate paths and states of mind that have overtaken the realities of some black athletes of today. I agree with his position that ""making the evolution to be a completely free man is realizing that racism is more virulent and determined than ever before."" In fact, I think the book is a must-read for all athletes -- if only to serve as an example of what not to become.That being said, I respectfully disagree with the overall notion that the black athlete today is simply ""lost,"" as Rhoden labels us in his book.He said that athletes are isolated and alienated from their ""native networks,"" and are ""increasingly cloistered into new networks as they become corporatized entities... excised from their communities as they fulfill their professional responsibilities and disconnected from the networks of people, in many cases predominately African-American, who once comprised their 'community' (p. 177). This leads to a general ignorance of the issues impacting a vast majority of African-Americans across the country.""This couldn't be further from the truth. And painting the entire, illustrious roster of current black athletes with this broad brush of ridicule, one that leaves no room for exceptions, is just wrong. If he had said ""some"" black athletes of today, I wouldn't have had an objection. But to say ""the contemporary tribe,"" as he calls us, ""with access to unprecedented wealth is lost,"" is completely inaccurate.The book's subtitle, The Rise, Fall, and Redemption of the Black Athlete, indicates that Rhoden is fully convinced that the modern-day black athlete's willingness to advocate for social and economic justice for all black people has diminished since the 1960s -- and perhaps disappeared, and that there currently exists a ""vacuum of leadership"" that has led to black athletes becoming a ""lost tribe.""There is a common myth about black athletes and social activism. It is that our disconnection from the black community and the retaliation black athletes face from reactionary sports media has fractured the ""common cause"" that once united all black athletes when they stood for causes for social justice. Many contemporary sports writers and analysts agree with Rhoden's assertion that after centuries of black athletes who faced the most dire consequences -- loss of livelihood and death threats -- we have now entered a period where an unspoken code encourages contemporary black athletes to avoid ""rocking the boat"" lest they risk losing their lucrative sponsorships and opportunity to compete professionally.For black professional athletes who do remain connected to the black community in significant ways, Rhoden focuses on the harsh reprisal that they are likely to face at the hands of a largely white, reactionary sports media (p. 209). Also at the root of the problem for contemporary athletes, Rhoden outlines, is the threat that engaging in causes and issues that management might consider politically unsavory would consequently lead to the loss of earnings potential.However, as seen with Garcon, the entire Washington Football team's secondary, this prediction did not prove true. They didn't receive any ridicule from the team for injecting themselves into a national tragedy and using the company logo to do so.Now for the brave Twitter trolls who hide behind their keyboards, that's another story. Unfortunately, the same people who are quick to criticize athletes for not using their various positions as platforms to speak out on various current issues will be the same ones to bombard them with vicious attacks when they do. Some fans simply do not respect the opinions of athletes and view them as simple entertainment. Some want them to simply be seen and not heard -- to simply shut up and play. However, not everyone is affected by those ""brave"" social media trolls who lurk in the corners of blog comment sections and Twitter.Again, I have tremendous respect for Rhoden and I feel that Forty Million Dollar Slaves should be required reading for every athlete beginning in high school. It gives us a history in knowing the tremendous sacrifices that were made for us. It gives us an account of the athletes that have come before us to lay the foundation so that we can have the opportunities we have today.The decisions made by Garcon, Merriweather and the entire secondary of the Washington Football team to publicly stand in solidarity, the passionate statements made by Missouri natives and former Washington Wizards White and Hughes, and by Coleman and Anderson should not be dismissed as singular and nominal. These are not the actions of a group that is, ""isolated and alienated from their native networks"" or someone possessing an ""ignorance of the issues impacting a vast majority of African-Americans across the country.""Rhoden and those who criticize black athletes for a lack of social consciousness should recognize, with the same vigor and thorough analysis, the efforts of contemporary black athletes who improve their communities and stand up for what they believe.This post first appeared on NBA.com.

8,RELIGION,"""My Dad's Legacy Is On The Line""",,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernice-king-ferguson_n_5724894.html,,2014-08-27,"Bernice King speaks during a news conference Thursday, Feb. 6, 2014, in Atlanta.at Ebenezer Baptist Church where her father Martin Luther King Jr. preached. King is in a legal battle with her brothers over her father's Bible and Nobel Peace Prize medal. (AP Photo/John Bazemore)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7ee491f0000df00252a61.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BELLEFONTAINE NEIGHBORS, Mo. (RNS) The youngest child of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. leaned toward the 30 students facing her inside the library at Riverview Gardens High School on Tuesday (Aug. 26). Many of them live near the epicenter of the chaos that erupted in Ferguson. It’s why Bernice King chose this school for this discussion.The students seemed curious about this visitor, whose late father led the marches and protests that they’ve read about in class. But before she arrived, a school district administrator asked for a show of hands of those who thought nonviolent protests and peaceful resistance used during the American civil rights movement remain relevant in light of Ferguson. Only one hand shot up.King is aware of this disconnect. “My dad’s legacy is on the line,” King told the students. “If this doesn’t turn out the right way, it could begin to have people question what happened years ago.”King believes the community is at a critical moment as it continues to confront the police shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown. And as it is for the students she spoke with on Tuesday, much of her concern is centered on the violence that may return as the legal process moves forward.“If he’s not indicted, what’s going to happen?” asked Justin Fowler, a senior, referring to Darren Wilson, the officer who shot Brown.“You tell me. You live here,” King said. “That’s the big question out there right now. So what’s going to happen?” “Everything will go bad,” he said.Defenders of Wilson say he shot Brown in self-defense. The fear that a grand jury may not indict him is why King and others with the King Center in Atlanta are in the St. Louis area listening to groups of youths to determine the best way to advocate nonviolence.They plan to develop a relationship with Riverview Gardens students, who are predominantly African-American and live closest to the unrest. The King Center officials hope to develop a strategy to help young people channel their anger in a nonviolent way, defusing a potentially explosive situation if the investigation doesn’t produce the results that many hope for.“That part is out of our hands,” King said of the investigation. “We’ve got to find a way to not make it worse. … We can’t destroy each other. We’re all we’ve got. We’ve got to band together as a community. But we’ve also got to wipe out the ‘us-and-them’ mentality.”The Ferguson situation has worn on the students who met Tuesday with King. They are the leaders of Riverview Gardens High. They’re the captains of the football team. The class officers. Members of junior ROTC.Some also live in the Canfield Green apartments, along the street where Brown was shot. D’Aja Washington, a sophomore, is friends with Brown’s sister.Some have participated in the protests on West Florissant Avenue. Some have gone there to hand out water. Some stayed home, where they still couldn’t escape the sounds of violence at night.Those who participated in the civil rights marches of Martin Luther King Jr.’s era have had trouble connecting with the young people on the streets of Ferguson this month who see the 1960s as irrelevant. Bernice King tried to bridge that divide.Her father, she said, “helped people channel that anger into something positive to bring about the change they were hoping for.”“They saw tanks too,” she said. “You think this is the first time tanks have been in a community? It’s not. You all think this was the first time tear gas was used? It was used on my daddy. In Selma. Tear gas, tanks. So, really, you’ve got to start thinking: What is the vision you want to see come out of this? It’s got to be big. You’ve got to see well beyond this moment.”King was just 5 years old when her father was assassinated in 1968. She dealt with death throughout her childhood, losing her uncle to a drowning and her grandmother to a fatal shooting. Her anger built, turning into rage at times. She’s since directed that energy into advocating the nonviolent philosophies of her father through the King Center.“I don’t know if you realize this, but anger is anger,” she told the students. “It has no mind. It has no rationality. It’s mad and it just wants to destroy. At the end of the day, you have to find a way to arrest that anger.”Ronada Hood, a senior, said she appreciated the conversation. The situation in Ferguson has made it more difficult for her to find a part-time job, since many of the businesses near where she lives have been looted and destroyed. “The violence didn’t solve anything,” she said.(Elisa Crouch writes for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.)

Shaky claims about Medicare were common in the 2012 campaign, from President Barack Obama on down. Now theyâve surfaced in this yearâs midterm elections, in one of the hottest Senate races in the country. McConnell responded Wednesday with an ad giving a dire spin to Medicare cuts set in motion by Obamaâs health care law, a familiar claim from the 2012 GOP playbook. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d3e11f0000250125743d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What happens when billionaire businessmen bent on reducing the taxes, regulations, and wages they pay gather with the politicians most closely aligned with their agenda? Because of Lauren Windsor's groundbreaking investigative journalism on The Undercurrent and The Nation, into the Koch brothers' secret conference at an Orange County California luxury resort, we now know. The revelations today about Mitch McConnell, Tom Cotton, Joni Ernst, and Cory Gardner flying to a luxury resort in California and pledging loyalty to the Koch agenda are breath-taking, especially the detailed information about the Koch brother front groups' electoral strategies. It confirms all of your most cynical fears about the behind-the-scenes deal-making between politicians and their financiers.   In the spirit of full disclosure, before I go any further, let me note that the organization I founded and chair, American Family Voices, has a consulting contract with Lauren to produce and promote a lot of our content. AFV has also been a public sponsor of her investigative journalism work through her web-show, The Undercurrent. AFV's support of The Undercurrent is in keeping with our history from the early days of our organizational work; supporting indie journalism is something we have always done.   These articles now provide us with an in-depth look at the Koch strategy for political domination, and their relationship to candidates who are eager to do their bidding. Here's Mitch McConnell: ""I want to start by thanking you, Charles and David, for the important work you are doing. I don't know where we'd be without you."" And the head of the Republican Governors Association: ""We've had no stronger partner over the last four years than American For Prosperity.""Or Republican US Senate candidate Joni Ernst: ""The first time I was introduced to this group was a year ago, August, in New Mexico, and I was not known at that time. A little known state senator from a very rural part of Iowa, uh, known through my National Guard service and some circles in Iowa. But the exposure to this group and to this network and the opportunity to meet so many of you, that really started my trajectory."" McConnell's entire speech is about how he has made as the number one passion of his career to make sure the millionaires and billionaires in the room can give as much money as they want to whatever politician or political entity they want without having to disclose who they gave to. He even brags about leading filibusters, and inventing a new one, in his fight against campaign finance reform in his very first term, saying, ""And I was so determined, I came up with a new filibuster."" After McConnell describes in great detail how he has served these billionaires' interests his whole career, he then makes clear that if Republicans get a majority, his number one priority will be to attach riders to appropriations bills to keep the government from having a cop on the beat to keep the oil and coal companies represented in the room from polluting, or keep the health industry execs there free to keep cheating their patients, or make sure the Wall Street bankers there are free to manipulate the markets so that they get ever-wealthier.   These articles are going to have major political implications in the 2014 elections. Here are some highlights...   1. McConnell giving a speech on why he has made fighting every bill that would lessen the power of big money in politics as the number one cause of his career is bad enough, his secret pledge to the money men in the room to force government regulators and prosecutors to back off of oversight in their industries is even worse. But his description of what the Democratic priorities may come back to haunt him most of all: And we're not going to be debating all these gosh darn proposals. That's all we do in the Senate is vote on things like raising the minimum wage (inaudible)--cost the country 500,000 new jobs; extending unemployment--that's a great message for retirees; uh, the student loan package the other day, that's just going to make things worse, uh. These people believe in all the wrong things.Quite a contrast: I'll give you friendly billionaires everything you want, plus we won't have to worry about stupid stuff like the minimum wage or helping the unemployed anymore.2. One of the quintessential moments of the whole conference was during the panel on what Koch front groups were doing in the elections. Tim Phillips, the head of Americans For Prosperity, starts talking about what a hero Tom Cotton is for voting against the farm bill, and the aristocracy applauds enthusiastically. Now the farm bill is pretty important in Arkansas; it pumps a huge amount of money into a very poor, rural state. While the billionaires at the secret meeting at the luxury resort in California may not like it, Arkansas farmers do. Cotton being so applauded for voting against the farm bill may not go over so well back home. Here's the other thing: Cotton missed the most important political event of the summer in Arkansas, the tomato festival that every statewide candidate for decades has been going to, in order to hang out with his billionaire friends in CA. The campaign refused to admit that he had gone, saying they wouldn't comment on what he had been doing instead of the tomato festival. Now there is not only confirmation that he went to the Koch event, but the people of Arkansas can hear his hosts applauding excitedly about his voting against the farm bill.  3. The news that Iowa Senate candidate Joni Ernst was there thanking the Kochs and their friends so profusely is a pretty big deal as well. She hadn't been listed on the official agenda obtained by The Nation, , and not only was she there singing the praises of the billionaire financiers in the room, she talks about being with them the conference a year ago, when she was an unknown state Senator just getting started in her race. Clearly, she is the Kochs' special favorite. In a populist state like Iowa, being that close to the Kochs might not be all that popular.   4. Another Senate candidate, Cory Gardner from Colorado, was introduced as being a true friend and a leader in ""free market"" energy issues, which is a polite way of saying let the big oil guys do what they will to the environment. Gardner waxed enthusiastically about the idea of Koch front groups coming not just to Colorado, but to the entire Rocky Mountain region -- that those states were ""ripe"" for their investment. The people of CO might be less excited about all that big oil money polluting their airwaves as well as their air and water.  5. Another huge story is the very close, perhaps illegal coordination going on at these meetings between the candidates, parties, and supposedly non-partisan Koch front groups. Having run a non-profit group for many years, I think it is safe to say that my normally mild-mannered lawyer would want to strangle me if I said the things about blatantly helping candidates that the head of AFP said in his panel. And to have the head of the Republican Governors Association say that AFP was their ""number one partner,"" and to have McConnell say that if you wanted to fight the Democrats, you could give directly to candidates or you could give to AFP? This degree of coordination is striking, even in the loose, murky world of campaign finance law.  These audio files reveal the frightening truth about the state of American politics in 2014 -- our country is being held hostage by a minority beholden to corporate interests. The Minority Leader of the United States Senate brags to billionaires about his career in service to their interests, and promises to deliver what they want if he gets to be the Majority Leader. Those same billionaires excitedly applaud a candidate for voting with them instead of his constituents. A ""non-partisan"" group on a panel with the head of the RGA talks through their strategy for taking control of the Senate. These transcripts are the story of big money in politics in the post-Citizens United era."

Steve King, R-Iowa, speaks to reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington. (AP Photo/Lauren Victoria Burke, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d3df250000cf003a539f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- One of the most vehement opponents of comprehensive immigration reform said Wednesday that he supports a tactic that could lead to another federal government shutdown.Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa) said that ""all bets are off"" about the fate of a continuing resolution to fund the government if President Barack Obama decides to unilaterally take action to provide deportations relief for undocumented immigrants. ""If the president wields his pen and commits that unconstitutional act to legalize millions, I think that becomes something that is nearly political nuclear,"" King said, according to the Des Moines Register. ""I think the public would be mobilized and galvanized and that changes the dynamic of any continuing resolution and how we might deal with that.""If the president takes action on immigration, as he is expected to do later this fall, King said that Republicans should push for the passage of House legislation on border security to become a ""requirement"" in exchange for funding the government. The House bill, which Republicans passed before leaving town for August recess, rolls back an existing administration policy that provides deportation relief for young immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally as children. The House bill also authorizes $659 million in funds to address the influx of undocumented children on the border, which is considerably less than the $3.7 billion the Obama administration requested.The tea party congressman echoed Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) in suggesting that Republicans could use the continuing resolution as a bargaining chip on other areas where they disagree with the White House, even if Obama does not take executive action on immigration.""When we hear some of our leaders say there will be no government shutdown, that's the political equivalent of saying there will be no boots on the ground,"" he said.Republican leaders are unlikely to pursue this tactic so close to the Nov. 4 midterm elections, especially considering how much voters blamed them for the 16-day partial government shutdown over the Affordable Care Act in October 2013. But given the events of last year's shutdown, in which the party's more conservative wing largely drove the agenda, it's not an impossible scenario. As the Atlantic's Molly Ball reported on Wednesday, GOP leaders are ""increasingly nervous about the potential for a rebellion on the funding bill.""It's also interesting that such a tactic could bring together two unlikely Republican members of Congress -- immigration foe and ""cantaloupe calves"" expert Steve King, and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a one-time champion for comprehensive immigration reform.""There will have to be some sort of a budget vote or a continuing resolution vote, so I assume there will be some sort of a vote on this,"" Rubio told Breitbart this week. ""I'm interested to see what kinds of ideas my colleagues have about using funding mechanisms to address this issue."""

The multi-phase plan includes the addition of 10 new and 23 expanded central distribution hubs, as well as the expansion or relocation of more than 300 existing facilities.

The ruling reversed a decision by a lower court that had stopped the plaintiffs' lawsuits from moving forward.In concurring with his colleagues, Judge Stephen S. Trott used a quote attributed to President Abraham Lincoln to argue that employees are still employees even if a company wants to call them contractors.""Abraham Lincoln reportedly asked, 'If you call a dog's tail a leg, how many legs does a dog have?'"" wrote Trott, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan. ""His answer was, 'Four. Calling a dog's tail a leg does not make it a leg.'"" (Exactly what Lincoln said, it should be noted, is a matter of dispute.)Over the years, FedEx has been sued by workers dozens of times over its independent contractor model, though many of those lawsuits have been dismissed or held on appeal.""We expect that the 9th Circuit's ruling will have a cascade effect on all other appeals pending around the country, and it really heralds the end of FedEx's way of doing business,"" said Beth Ross, an attorney who led the plaintiffs' case.In a statement, FedEx Ground said it would ask for a review of the ruling by the entire 9th Circuit. The company also said it had legally strengthened its contractor model in 2011, and argued that Wednesday's ruling doesn't apply to its current labor model.""We fundamentally disagree with these rulings, which run counter to more than 100 state and federal findings -- including the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit -- upholding our contractual relationships with thousands of independent businesses,"" said Cary Blancett, FedEx Ground's senior vice president and general counsel.FedEx is largely credited with having pioneered the ""independent contractor"" work model in the logistics industry. Under this system, workers function as self-employed drivers with their own routes, covering the costs of their own trucks, gasoline, uniforms and so forth. While corporations claim the contractor system gives drivers flexibility and strong incentives as ""small businesses,"" critics say it's simply a way to shift the costs of employment onto workers and avoid payroll taxes and workers'-compensation costs.The basic question in lawsuits involving the independent contractor model is whether or not a company like FedEx still maintains control over the work itself. In Wednesday's ruling, the judges asserted that it does.""Although our decision substantially unravels FedEx's business model,"" Trott wrote in his decision, ""FedEx was not entitled to 'write around' the principles and mandates of California Labor Law.""As HuffPost reported earlier this year, this model has been widely adopted by other trucking and courier companies, many of whose drivers work long hours for low pay and little job security. One worker who drives for the delivery company Lasership, which is a major Amazon contractor, described the arrangement this way: ""It's like they want us to be employees, but they don't want to pay for it.""In its statement, FedEx Ground said that due to recent lawsuits and regulations, the company had ""taken a number of steps in recent years to enhance its operating agreements with the independent businesses that contract with the company.""

Scott Walker (R) narrowly trailing his Democratic opponent, Mary Burke. Forty-nine percent of individuals considered likely to vote in November said they would support Burke, compared to 47 percent who plan to vote for Walker. These results are virtually unchanged from the results of Marquette Law School's July poll, when Burke led Walker among likely voters by a margin of 47 percent to 46 percent. Burke's name recognition has gone up markedly since July, when 49 percent of respondents said they had no opinion of her. In the new poll, only 35 percent said they have no opinion of Burke. Another 33 percent of respondents said they have a favorable opinion of her, while 32 percent said they have an unfavorable opinion. Opinions of Walker are divided, with 48 percent expressing a positive opinion of him and another 48 percent expressing a negative opinion."" [HuffPost]The Democrat does better among likely voters? The Marquette poll gave Republican Walker a slight edge among all registered voters (48 to 44 percent), but Burke an even smaller advantage among those who say they are certain to vote (49 to 47 percent). The modest shift in the Democrat's direction as the sample narrowed to ""likely voters"" raised eyebrows among poll watchers, since the usual pattern is in the opposite direction. HuffPollster offers two reasons to be cautious about making too much of that difference: First, all but 25 percent of the registered voters interviewed say they are ""absolutely certain"" to vote. Second, while Democrats were more likely to express such certainty (82 percent) in this survey than Republicans (68 percent), the difference does not appear to be statistically significant. [Marquette]Either way, it's close - ""The main message should be this is a very tight race and no one can credibly claim to be ahead over the past three months,"" Marquette University Law School Poll Director Charles Franklin tells HuffPollster via email. ""But among those RVs who are NOT 'Certain to vote' 61% are Don’t Know on Mary Burke Fav/unfav. They give Walker a 50-31 vote advantage even though they give him just a 47% approve, same as among LVs. So lack of knowledge of Burke among the 'less-likely' voters is surely playing an important part.""

Literally. A USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll of 500 likely Iowa voters, taken Saturday through Tuesday, finds 201 [respondents] supporting Democrat Bruce Braley and 200 supporting Republican Joni Ernst in a contest in which Democrats initially were favored. Ernst has made it a too-close-to-call race thanks in part to a sly TV ad about her skill in castrating pigs and some Braley verbal gaffes. The statewide politics in the middle of the country has been nationalized: One in four say their congressional ballot is intended as a vote against President Obama, and one in four say it is a vote for him. Six in 10 say the question of which party will control Congress is a factor in how they will cast their ballot."" [USA Today]POLL FINDS GREATER GOP ATTENTION TO MIDTERMS - Jeffrey M. Jones: ""One in three Americans (33%) say they have given 'quite a lot' or 'some' thought to the 2014 midterm election, up from 26% in April. Importantly, Republicans (42%) are much more engaged than Democrats (27%) in the election at this point….The question about the thought Americans are giving to the election is one that Gallup uses to identify those Americans most inclined to vote in a coming election. Consistent with their usually higher voter turnout, typically more Republicans than Democrats say they have given thought to the election….Overall, the changes in the election thought gap by party in the final months before previous elections suggest that the gap in late summer or early fall is by no means what will be in place on Election Day. If there is no significant narrowing of the Republican-Democratic thought gap between now and Election Day, the Republican advantage in turnout could surpass that on Election Day 2010. One difference, though, is that registered voters were more likely to say they were going to vote for Republican candidates in 2010 than they are now."" [Gallup] Previously: Pew Research found Republicans more optimistic than Democrats about their chances this year. [HuffPost]IN DEFENSE OF NATIONAL POLLING - Peyton M. Craighill and Scott Clement: ""Fivethirtyeight founder Nate Silver posed a provocative question on Monday: Is the polling industry in stasis or in crisis? In a nutshell, Silver argues that polls today are largely accurate in general elections, but that 'dismal' response rates are making polls increasingly reliant on demographic adjustments to make samples representative….Over the period from 1998 and 2012 -- as poll response rates have declined dramatically and many non-standard methodologies such as automated and Internet-sampled surveys have sprung up -- poll election accuracy has not declined. Analyses by the National Council on Public Polls -- a consortium of national pollsters -- have also found that most final pre-election polls from 2000 to 2012 have been quite accurate, historically speaking….So, yes, the polling industry is in a time of change. But, there's more reason for optimism than you might think….What's often ignored amid the response rate panic is that lower participation rates have generally proven to be poor predictors of survey errors in random sample polls….Far from 'stasis,' major polling innovations on how to properly include cellular phones in the past decade has helped such surveys maintain accuracy. This is good news for election watchers, and one that helps explain the paradox of declining response rates but stable election poll accuracy.""

The San Fermin festival is a symbol of Spanish culture that attracts thousands of tourists to watch the bull runs despite heavy condemnation from animal rights groups.

I absolutely agree that all of the issues he listed are important, but as an animal rights supporter I believe there's more than enough room for an entire menu of important issues, including the moral and humane treatment of animals and the protection of endangered species. Besides, it's not as if the U.S. government is somehow busily prioritizing animal rights at the expense of thwarting Ebola or the ISIS threat. Unfortunately, there's exactly nothing on the political docket with regards to protecting animals. So, it's unclear why animal rights activism needed to be taken down a notch. Let me know when a congressional candidate or incumbent mentions animal rights during the midterm and I'll post an update here. But it isn't going to happen.Horrifying abuses to humans, animals and the environment by the American meat-packing industry -- a major contributor to Ben's number-one most important issue, global warming -- will surely continue. (Incidentally, abusive treatment of beef cattle can lead to diseases that harm humans.) Convictions for animal neglect and abuse won't be toughened any time soon. (Animal abusers are often spousal/child abusers, too, or worse.) And don't expect any government action to help protect, say, critically endangered gorilla populations in war-torn Africa -- say nothing of endangered species here in America, each of which invariably becomes a punchline by the anti-science far-right.Knowing this, is there really any threat to Ben's ""important"" issues? No. I get it, animal rights activists can be overzealous (most activists groups generally are), but perhaps they need to be in order to make a dent given the absence of legislative attention. Every issue needs a dedicated group of people who are willing to rattle some cages in order to bring awareness and attention to suffering, inhumanity and immorality. When it comes to animal rights, which doesn't enjoy a spot anywhere near the top 20 most important issues for voters, but which even Ben admits is ""a good thing,"" doesn't it deserve focus and attention from someone? Doesn't it deserve to be someone's highest priority? Go to an animal shelter one of these days and tell me it doesn't need to be.Speaking for myself and the short list of topics I cover here, I've chosen to write mostly about issues like presidential politics, journalism, national security and health care. Should I be scolded because I haven't written about Ebola or clean water? Should Ben? Likewise, why should anyone who thinks this issue is ""a good thing"" scold Pamela Anderson or Bill Maher or Sigourney Weaver for supporting animal rights? If you think Ebola is more important, then go out and campaign for the eradication of Ebola (gorillas, by the way, are being decimated by it). And if you really, really expect Anderson et al, or President Obama for that matter, to precisely validate your list of priorities, you're going to be gravely disappointed in life.To repeat: there are enough issues to go around, and in the internet age, it's not difficult to find extensive reporting about each one. If you expect me or Ben to write about your exact list of important issues, you're visiting the wrong website. But you shouldn't be hard-pressed to find outlets that match your priorities. And Ben shouldn't be hard-pressed to find an extensive roster of legislators who are making his list a top priority as well.For, against or indifferent, you have to admit this is an issue that gets ripped on all ends of the spectrum, whether by right-wing gun fetishists blasting away at woodland critters or by left-wing foodie hipsters shoveling foie gras and factory beef into their gullets while bitching that Republicans don't give a shit about climate change. For those reasons and more, there's no chance in the foreseeable future that protecting animals will become a major legislative priority. No one's smacking the burgers out of your mouths, America. Animal abusers will continue to be ignored or merely slapped on the wrist (or offered professional sports contracts). Ignorant morons will continue to pump cash into circuses featuring animal acts. And Dick Cheney types will always -- repeat, always -- be allowed to annihilate flightless birds for fun. In the face of all this, there's nothing wrong with a group of people standing against torture and abuse -- there's nothing wrong with lobbying for humane alternatives -- there's nothing wrong with strongly, perhaps loudly advocating on behalf of the defenseless animals who exist at the receiving end of our collective selfishness and gluttony.Cross-posted at The Daily Banter.Click here to listen to the Bubble Genius Bob & Chez Show podcast.

15,LATINO VOICES,Afro-Brazilians Demand Slavery Reparations Because 'Poverty Has A Color',Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/quilombos-brazil_n_5692077.html,,2014-08-26,"<div class=""feature-caption""><em>Almir Viera Pereira holds a handful of dry soil on a patch of disputed land his group has claimed under Brazil's constitutional right to reparations for descendants of runaway slaves. (Carolina Ramirez/The Huffington Post)</em></div>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e987b4a2500006b06eafae5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"This article is the second in a two-part series about Brazil's quilombo movement. Read the first part here.The dry grass crackled under Almir Vieira Pereira's shoes as he walked along the edges of the roça, a small patch of land he's been fighting to plant on for years. He grabbed a handful of soil and watched it puff into a smoky cloud as it settled back to the ground. Brazil's northeastern backlands are known for their dryness. Perennial droughts have sent generations of northeasterners fleeing from impoverished farming towns like this one for the industrial cities of the South -- São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte. Barra do Parateca's soil had yet to recover from last year's lack of rain. But dry or not, the ability to walk freely across this field marked a major victory for Pereira. He and a group of slave descendants from the roughly 1,500-person hamlet of Barra do Parateca have spent the last five years invading chunks of land across the area that they say are rightfully theirs under a well-known but haphazardly enforced article of the Brazilian Constitution. That law guarantees permanent, non-transferable land titles to Brazilians descended from the members of runaway slave settlements. Such communities of descendants are known in Brazil as ""quilombos.""Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country and relatively underpopulated, but land ownership remains out of reach most of the nation's poor farmers, many of whose ancestors worked the fields for European overlords. The ability to plant one's own food marks the first step for people like Pereira in a long march out of poverty and toward independence. ""Our fight for land is all about producing food,"" Pereira, 39, said. ""The great thinkers of the world, they're thinking about creating things, inventing things. We're still thinking about eating. If the government really wants racial reparations, they have to at least give us the possibility to think like equals.""Four years ago, anyone who looked across this 15-acre plot would have seen razed earth littered with broken ceramic tiles that had once served as the roof of a camp shelter. The cops had wiped out that settlement after the neighbors who owned the land, the Pereira Pinto family, failed to persuade Pereira and his fellow quilombo residents to vacate the premises.Pereira and his group had had several run-ins with authorities before, but this time was different. Normally, they would be allowed to finish the harvest if they agreed to abandon the plot when they were done. This time, police destroyed the crops in front of a crowd of Barra residents.""Everyone was crying and we couldn't do anything,"" Pereira's friend, Ducilene Magalhães, recalled. ""We just watched."" These days, Pereira and Magalhães have arrived at an uneasy truce with the landowners. Though the owners are in the midst of pursuing legal action and have removed an irrigation system that once watered the field, they're also reluctantly allowing the quilombo members to harvest crops on a small patch of the property until the courts settle the dispute. Although quilombos dotted the Brazilian landscape throughout the era of slavery, which lasted from the 1500s until 1889, they faded into history during the 20th century. Most of the legislators who approved the quilombo law, ratified in 1988 as part of the new Brazilian Constitution, viewed it as a symbolic gesture that would affect only a handful of families. But in 2003, a decree by left-wing President Luiz Inácio ""Lula"" da Silva made it possible for virtually any black community to apply for quilombo status, if a majority of its residents so decided. Since Lula's order, the number of certified quilombos has skyrocketed from fewer than three dozen to more than 2,400, with hundreds more in the process of applying for recognition. In total, more than 1 million Brazilians are demanding their constitutional right to land in what may become the largest slavery reparations program ever attempted. In practice, however, the program remains a dead letter for many. Despite a constitutional guarantee and the lip service of almost 12 years of continuous Worker Party-led government, only 217 quilombos have received official land titles as of this year. Impatient with the slow hand of Brazilian bureacracy, quilombos across the country like Barra do Parateca are invading the promised parcels of land, sometimes igniting violent conflicts with their wealthier neighbors in the process. Few who walk the lone paved street of the town of Barra do Parateca would imagine that Brazil boasts the world's seventh-largest economy. Lying off the banks of the São Francisco river, about 400 miles into the rain-starved interior of the state of Bahia, Barra do Parateca is reachable only by boat or by a bumpy ride along a dirt road. Braying donkeys wander freely, feeding on discarded cartons, plastic soda bottles and spoiled food that lies in piles on the ground because the town lacks regular trash collection. The garbage embarrasses Pereira. An evangelical pastor, he's thrown himself into building Barra do Parateca's quilombo with the civic-minded, can-do attitude of a budding politician. (He did, in fact, run for local office recently and lost to a white man, which he said was a bitter experience for an Afro-Brazilian running in a majority-black district.) He wears pressed pants and button-down shirts, drinks soda instead of beer and wants future generations of Barra do Parateca's students to speak grammatically correct Portuguese, rather than the local dialects that often disregard subject-verb agreement. But building a better Barra is a job that would try the patience of even the most progressive-minded idealist. While the boost in social spending during Brazil's past decade has helped alleviate the worst of the poverty, few people in town own land or any other productive enterprise that could lift Barra do Parateca into prosperity. Those who do have no intention of handing it over to people like Pereira.Facing a life of toiling in someone else's field for a pittance or waiting to cash government social assistance checks, many residents instead choose to leave. In search of work, they head to cities like São Paulo, a metropolis of 20 million located 850 miles to the south. Most of them wind up in ""favelas,"" the violence-plagued slums that ring Brazil's cities. Others migrate to the interior of São Paulo state to pick oranges or cut sugar cane. In a town of roughly 1,500 residents, some 30 of Barra do Parateca's men left to work in São Paulo last year, all of them fathers, Pereira says. Another 15 told him of plans to leave this year. Despite the hardship, Pereira doesn't want to leave the place where he was born. He wants Barra do Parateca to break out of its rut. And he sees land ownership, and the independence that comes with it, as the key. By ""land,"" he's quick to clarify, he means real land -- not the tiny patch that his neighbors begrudgingly let his quilombo use now. With land, Pereira says, he and his fellow quilombolas could produce their own food, with a little left over for sale in local markets.""We don't want to keep depending on the government,"" Pereira said. ""In Brazil, without land, you're no one.""Brazil is among the world's most violent countries, with a homicide rate of 25 per 100,000 residents as of 2012. A government report released last year suggested the persistent killings stem from a ""culture of violence"" fed by murderous conflicts between the drug cartels and other criminal gangs that have thrived in the cities' favelas. In the northern city of Maceió, the homicide rate in 2011 stood at a whopping 111 per 100,000, according to the report. But Brazil's overflowing favelas are a symptom of larger problems that originate in places like Barra do Parateca, where waves of impoverished farmers, many if not most of them descended from slaves, have fled the countryside over the past half century. In 1950, the Brazilian census placed the urban population at 31 percent. As of 2013, that figure has climbed to 85 percent. Land is the one major factor that pushes Brazilians to leave the countryside and crowd into the packed cities. Like in Barra do Parateca, land is all but unobtainable with the wages most Brazilian farm workers make. ""The highly unequal distribution of land in Brazil is clearly an important reason that Brazil's cities have grown in such a rapid, unequal and violent way,"" Sean Mitchell, an anthropology professor at Rutgers University who studies quilombos, wrote in an email to HuffPost. While Mitchell thinks it would be ""impossible to roll back the haphazard and violent growth of Brazil's cities through reforms in the countryside,"" he added that ""land reform would significantly alleviate violence in the countryside."" Land seemed an impossible dream for Pereira until 2005, when he helped found a local organization dedicated to addressing racial inequality. While working with the group, he learned about the Brazilian Constitution's quilombo clause: that communities descended from runaway slaves were entitled to own the land they lived on. All he had to do to gain access to the land was form an official association, collect signatures from a majority of the town's residents and take them to the country's capital, Brasília, to apply. Pereira searched Barra do Parateca's history for evidence of its origins as a quilombo. Very little has been written about the tiny town, but he managed to find an account by a priest, published in 1991, that described the area's origins as a ""fazenda,"" or ranch, owned by a Portuguese family during the colonial period. According to the document, the family raised sugar cane and herded cattle using slave labor. ""Those were my ancestors,"" Pereira said. ""It was from that moment that we began to identify, we began to understand our origins."" He gathered signatures from more than half the town's residents and took the day-long bus ride to Brasilia to drop off the paperwork. The town became a certified quilombo in January 2006, and along with its status came a new school and health clinic. But quilombo certification only extends to the town itself. The coveted farmlands that surround Barra do Parateca remain the private property of assorted ranchers and farmers. And eight years after certification, the government has yet to publish the legally required technical study documenting Barra do Parateca's land claim, let alone negotiate indemnization with all the current landowners or transfer a title to Pereira and his community. Representatives from the Institute of Colonization and Land Reform, or INCRA, which carries out the titling process, say they're overburdened by the massive number of claims, which as of this year have reached 569 in the state of Bahia alone, according to federal government figures. Although the constitution guarantees quilombos' property rights, INCRA can't simply take chunks of land and hand them to new owners. Instead, it must compensate the titleholders, who generally resist the agency's attempts to take over their property, leading to lengthy legal disputes.""We can't expropriate land -- we also have to indemnify,"" Itamar Rangel at the INCRA's office in Salvador da Bahia told HuffPost. ""Brazilian law defends the property rights of any citizen."" That lack of efficiency isn't unique to the state of Bahia. INCRA estimates the total amount of land currently claimed by quilombos in Brazil to be around 4.4 million acres -- an area roughly the size of New Jersey. But the government has issued just 217 land titles as of this year, having granted only three last year and three in 2012. At this rate, the growing backlog that now stands at roughly 2,200 quilombos won't be getting cleared any time soon. In 2007, frustrated with the pace of Brazilian bureaucracy, Barra do Parateca's quilombo association stopped waiting and started planting. They planted along the river banks. They planted on land just outside the town. They rode boats up the river and walked into the forest to plant in isolated fields, setting up campsites along the way. Today, when the quilombo residents are able to harvest those crops, it helps supplement their modestly stocked pantries and refrigerators. The landowners usually fight back. As often as not, landowners find the clandestine fields and let cattle loose to feed on the crops before they're harvested. About a dozen landowners from Barra do Parateca are battling the quilombo association's claims. Of all those fights, none is more tense than the one involving the Pinto family. Hélio Pereira Pinto, 71, isn't the kind of person you'd imagine as one of the quilombo's biggest enemies. An aging man whose thick, sun-battered skin folds neatly along his cheeks, Pinto walks with a limp, the result of his father's inability to pay for a doctor when Pinto developed a benign tumor in his left knee at age 10. Although the tumor splintered his tibia, forcing shards of bone through his skin, he spent his life working as a field hand, one of the most backbreaking and poorly paid jobs Brazil has to offer. He still has scars under his arm from the years he worked in the fields while supporting himself with a crutch. He remembers listening to radio broadcasts from Cuba's Communist government in the 1960s, hoping that a similar revolution would make its way to Brazil. But his experiences in recent years have tempered his revolutionary enthusiasm. Pinto owns the piece of land where Pereira and his fellow quilombolas have arrived at their uneasy truce. His son João Batista Pinto -- a judge in the neighboring city of Guanambi who is entangled in a separate land dispute with the quilombo -- has repeatedly called the cops to kick them out. After the police destroyed the quilombo association's illicit crops in 2010, someone set a bus belonging to Hélio Pinto on fire. The Pinto family suspects retribution, but no one has owned up to the deed. Four years later, the bus's charred remains still sit on the town's main road, now engulfed by a tree that has grown around it. Land holds much the same meaning for Hélio Pinto, who is white, as it does for Pereira. The oldest of 18 children, Pinto was born less than two miles from Barra do Parateca, where his landless family lived on the property of a wealthier man named Antonio Bastos. Pinto's family worked as ""agregados,"" meaning they were allowed to live on the land and use a chunk of it to grow their own food, in exchange for their labor. Some experts have described the relationship, common in the Brazilian countryside, as something better than slavery, but not quite freedom. One day, for reasons unclear to Pinto, Bastos kicked the family out, along with his other agregados. Pinto's father found new work as an agregado on a ranch in what would become Barra do Parateca. This was in the early 1950s, and Barra wasn't yet a town -- just another tract of land owned by a wealthy ranching family. After decades of working the fields, Pinto scraped together enough money to buy the small patch of land that the quilombo association now disputes. The fighting has grown so frustrating for João Batista Pinto, Hélio's son, that he doesn't even want his parcel of land anymore. As a lawyer in the neighboring city of Guanambi, he now has little use for it, and the bad blood created by the land conflicts makes him feel uncomfortable visiting the town of his birth. He would gladly give it up, he says, if only someone would pay him for it. It's not the first time someone has tried to take over João Batista Pinto's small patch of land. In the 1970s, when Brazil was under military rule, the Bahian government unsuccessfully tried to relocate the town to accommodate a dam project. The INCRA expropriated a series of tracts in the area, including João Batista's. So the land, in theory, belongs to the government -- except that, as often happens with Brazil's slow-moving bureaucracy, INCRA never paid him for it. ""This case has been pending ever since then, until the present day,"" João Batista said. ""Without payment, without indemnization. This happens all over the place in Brazil."" Still, Hélio Pinto has trouble understanding how Barra do Parateca could possibly be a quilombo. As one of the few residents who's lived in the town since its establishment, he knows that the original inhabitants were, like him, virtually all white. Now, he says, the peaceful community he once knew has been torn apart, and the land he labored for has been made worthless by the political aspirations of black people from neighboring towns. ""There was never any quilombo here. There were never any slaves,"" Pinto said. ""Today most people here are black, there's no white people anymore. But the blacks are all migrants. None of them are really from here."" Many in the Brazilian media share the Pintos' suspicions about the authenticity of today's quilombos. Television coverage often tilts more toward his point of view than Pereira's. One of the most famous cases occurred in 2007, when Brazil's largest television news broadcaster, O Globo, visited the quilombo of São Francisco do Paraguaçú in the northern part of the country. O Globo's reporters asked residents if they considered themselves quilombolas. Several people said no. One man said he'd never heard of the term until recent years. Another said he'd never heard the term at all. In the final version of the story, the producers did not air the comments of the quilombo association's leaders or the interviewees who affirmed the existence of their quilombo. The story erroneously claimed that the area was not a historical site of slavery and that sugar had not been planted in the region when, in fact, the ruins of a colonial-era sugar mill lay just a short distance upriver. The report sparked protests in the community and deepened a rift that pitted neighbor against neighbor, with some residents posting signs in front of their doors reading ""I'm not a quilombola, no."" The federal government re-evaluated the community's anthropological report, but it eventually chose to uphold the group's quilombo certification.Despite the support of the government, episodes like this have undermined the public image of the fledgling social movement. Politicians who would go on to form Democráticos 25, a conservative, pro-market political party, hoped to take advantage of public doubts about quilombos' credibility. They filed a legal challenge in 2004, arguing that Lula da Silva's decree allowing virtually any group of black people to declare themselves a quilombo illegally skirted Congress' authority. By 2010, the case had made its way to Brazil's highest court, which has yet to rule on it. A decision in Democráticos 25's favor could annul all the land titles issued under the law and strip thousands of communities of their quilombo status overnight. Pereira doesn't dispute that Barra do Parateca was once a largely white community. He acknowledges that most of the town's black residents first arrived about four decades ago -- including his mother, who was born in a town on the other side of the river. But he also takes a wider view of his community's history. According to the priest's 1991 account, before the town existed, the area of Barra do Parateca belonged to one large Portuguese landowner whose massive holdings stretched across the hinterland. That man's claim encompassed a number of neighboring majority-black towns, including the first certified quilombo in the state of Bahia, Rio das Rãs. ""Before the community, before the town, it was a fazenda,"" Pereira said. ""So all of this black population here in the Parateca region -- Pau D'Arco, Barra do Parateca -- in reality, we're all the same people."" And anyway, all of this is beside the point, as far as Pereira is concerned. Fighting over these chunks of land for the last few years has made him rethink not just poverty, but race as well. ""Slavery was abolished,"" Pereira said. ""But the black people around here -- my ancestors -- never had a single title. Abolition happened, but we're practically continuing as if we were slaves today. How come we don't get the right to reparations?"" Brazilians' disagreement over how to define a quilombo stems in part from the country's historic reluctance to define who is black. People either partially or wholly of African descent make up a majority of the population, but unlike in the United States, Brazil never saw widespread legal segregation, and racial mixing has been common since the colonial period. That legacy has made it difficult for Brazilians to build political movements devoted to confronting racism. Many Brazilians view their country as a ""racial democracy,"" where the lack of strict distinctions between ""black"" and ""white"" has fostered an ethnically harmonious society. Yet Afro-Brazilian intellectuals and the country's social scientists have long dismissed that interpretation, pointing to research and statistics that they say reveal broad patterns of discrimination. As of 2011, Brazilian black and mixed-race workers on average earned only 60 percent of the salaries of white workers, according to the country's national statistics agency. Some 70 percent of homicide victims are black, according to a 2013 study by the Institute of Applied Economic Research. Researchers at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro calculated last year that if the Brazilian population were divided along racial lines, whites would occupy the 65th position on the U.N. Human Development Index, while Afro-Brazilians would only reach 102nd place. Given the expansiveness of Brazil's legal definition of ""quilombos,"" it's hard to mount an argument that Barra do Parateca does not qualify. More than half of the Barra do Parateca community signed the petition to declare its ethnic quilombo identity, as required. A social scientist visited the town and verified the claim. The lawsuits filed against the quilombo's land invasions would, theoretically, be trumped by a decision by INCRA to compensate the current landowners accordingly and seize the property on behalf of the quilombo. But INCRA's officials, 500 miles away in a building with a leaky ceiling, have yet to finalize the paperwork, let alone issue a land title. They're responsible for the nearly 600 quilombo claims across Bahia, some of which face crises more serious than Barra do Parateca's. Nevertheless, the lack of progress infuriates the already frustrated quilombo association. When asked who the quilombo movement's greatest enemy is, Pereira didn't mention the landowners. Instead, he began talking about the government, which catapulted the movement into existence in 1988, then let it founder, leaving quilombo residents to wonder whether the constitutional article will wither into a broken promise. ""The greatest enemy of the quilombo movement is the Brazilian state itself,"" Pereira said. ""The slowness."" João Batista Pinto's anger at the quilombo association is no longer what it was four years ago, when he sent the cops to break up its occupation of his land. He's now resigned to put up with the irritation of the land dispute while the courts and INCRA slowly sort the mess out. But like his father, he harbors resentment, and finds it laughable to think Barra do Parateca could be classified as a quilombo. ""It's an old concept,"" João Batista said. ""To apply it to the contemporary world is difficult. They're trying to apply that article in order to gain social benefits, but they're doing it fraudulently."" Recalling the old problem of how to define who is black in Brazil, João Batista pointed out that his sister Heldina looks white, and then asked rhetorically if he himself looks black. With his dark bronze skin and coarse straight hair, he could belong to any number of Brazil's intermingling ethnic combinations. In the United States, no one would call him white. João Batista added that he and his family come from Barra do Parateca. Does that make them quilombolas? ""It's not enough just to demonstrate the presence of a black population, because if that were all you needed, Salvador da Bahia would be a quilombo,"" he said. ""Bom Jesús da Lapa, Rio de Janeiro, all the other states. Brazil would be one giant quilombo."" In the meantime, Barra do Parateca waits, and Pereira enjoys his early morning walk around the roça while a friend hacks at weeds with a machete. The soil might be more moist if Hélio Pinto hadn't taken down the irrigation system he installed years ago. On the other hand, the cops haven't come this year to kick the quilombo out and destroy the small patch of plantings on the Pinto family's 15-acre plot. In his mother's kitchen, Pereira sits down to eat a cut of gristly beef with a side of rice, black beans and farofa, a yucca flour that Brazilians sprinkle on their food to add flavor and make it more filling. For Pereira, few things reveal more about Brazil's race relations than his meals. ""This is the way I see it, the world is what you're thinking about,"" said Pereira. ""If you're hungry, what are you going to think about? About food. So most of the world's poor only think about food. They go to school and they're thinking about snack time, about lunch, because those who are hungry only think about eating."" Pereira said he envies the United States, a country viewed by many Brazilians as more racist than their own, for electing a black president. Why, he asks, in his country, where people of color make up a majority of the population, does the idea of a black president seem beyond the realm of possibility? Like most quilombolas, Pereira isn't convinced that he lives in a racial democracy.""They say it's not, but Brazil is a racist country -- in all the ways that you could imagine,"" Pereira said, pointing to the skin on his forearm. ""In Brazil, poverty has a color.""The reporting for this project was made possible by a Social Justice Reporting for a Global America fellowship from the International Center for Journalists."

Such communities of descendants are known in Brazil as ""quilombos.""Brazil is the world's fifth-largest country and relatively underpopulated, but land ownership remains out of reach most of the nation's poor farmers, many of whose ancestors worked the fields for European overlords. The ability to plant one's own food marks the first step for people like Pereira in a long march out of poverty and toward independence. ""Our fight for land is all about producing food,"" Pereira, 39, said. ""The great thinkers of the world, they're thinking about creating things, inventing things. We're still thinking about eating. If the government really wants racial reparations, they have to at least give us the possibility to think like equals.""Four years ago, anyone who looked across this 15-acre plot would have seen razed earth littered with broken ceramic tiles that had once served as the roof of a camp shelter. The cops had wiped out that settlement after the neighbors who owned the land, the Pereira Pinto family, failed to persuade Pereira and his fellow quilombo residents to vacate the premises.Pereira and his group had had several run-ins with authorities before, but this time was different. Normally, they would be allowed to finish the harvest if they agreed to abandon the plot when they were done. This time, police destroyed the crops in front of a crowd of Barra residents.""Everyone was crying and we couldn't do anything,"" Pereira's friend, Ducilene Magalhães, recalled. ""We just watched."" These days, Pereira and Magalhães have arrived at an uneasy truce with the landowners. Though the owners are in the midst of pursuing legal action and have removed an irrigation system that once watered the field, they're also reluctantly allowing the quilombo members to harvest crops on a small patch of the property until the courts settle the dispute. Although quilombos dotted the Brazilian landscape throughout the era of slavery, which lasted from the 1500s until 1889, they faded into history during the 20th century. Most of the legislators who approved the quilombo law, ratified in 1988 as part of the new Brazilian Constitution, viewed it as a symbolic gesture that would affect only a handful of families. But in 2003, a decree by left-wing President Luiz Inácio ""Lula"" da Silva made it possible for virtually any black community to apply for quilombo status, if a majority of its residents so decided. Since Lula's order, the number of certified quilombos has skyrocketed from fewer than three dozen to more than 2,400, with hundreds more in the process of applying for recognition. In total, more than 1 million Brazilians are demanding their constitutional right to land in what may become the largest slavery reparations program ever attempted. In practice, however, the program remains a dead letter for many. Despite a constitutional guarantee and the lip service of almost 12 years of continuous Worker Party-led government, only 217 quilombos have received official land titles as of this year. Impatient with the slow hand of Brazilian bureacracy, quilombos across the country like Barra do Parateca are invading the promised parcels of land, sometimes igniting violent conflicts with their wealthier neighbors in the process. Few who walk the lone paved street of the town of Barra do Parateca would imagine that Brazil boasts the world's seventh-largest economy. Lying off the banks of the São Francisco river, about 400 miles into the rain-starved interior of the state of Bahia, Barra do Parateca is reachable only by boat or by a bumpy ride along a dirt road. Braying donkeys wander freely, feeding on discarded cartons, plastic soda bottles and spoiled food that lies in piles on the ground because the town lacks regular trash collection. The garbage embarrasses Pereira. An evangelical pastor, he's thrown himself into building Barra do Parateca's quilombo with the civic-minded, can-do attitude of a budding politician. (He did, in fact, run for local office recently and lost to a white man, which he said was a bitter experience for an Afro-Brazilian running in a majority-black district.) He wears pressed pants and button-down shirts, drinks soda instead of beer and wants future generations of Barra do Parateca's students to speak grammatically correct Portuguese, rather than the local dialects that often disregard subject-verb agreement. But building a better Barra is a job that would try the patience of even the most progressive-minded idealist. While the boost in social spending during Brazil's past decade has helped alleviate the worst of the poverty, few people in town own land or any other productive enterprise that could lift Barra do Parateca into prosperity. Those who do have no intention of handing it over to people like Pereira.Facing a life of toiling in someone else's field for a pittance or waiting to cash government social assistance checks, many residents instead choose to leave. In search of work, they head to cities like São Paulo, a metropolis of 20 million located 850 miles to the south. Most of them wind up in ""favelas,"" the violence-plagued slums that ring Brazil's cities. Others migrate to the interior of São Paulo state to pick oranges or cut sugar cane. In a town of roughly 1,500 residents, some 30 of Barra do Parateca's men left to work in São Paulo last year, all of them fathers, Pereira says. Another 15 told him of plans to leave this year. Despite the hardship, Pereira doesn't want to leave the place where he was born. He wants Barra do Parateca to break out of its rut. And he sees land ownership, and the independence that comes with it, as the key. By ""land,"" he's quick to clarify, he means real land -- not the tiny patch that his neighbors begrudgingly let his quilombo use now. With land, Pereira says, he and his fellow quilombolas could produce their own food, with a little left over for sale in local markets.""We don't want to keep depending on the government,"" Pereira said. ""In Brazil, without land, you're no one.""Brazil is among the world's most violent countries, with a homicide rate of 25 per 100,000 residents as of 2012. A government report released last year suggested the persistent killings stem from a ""culture of violence"" fed by murderous conflicts between the drug cartels and other criminal gangs that have thrived in the cities' favelas. In the northern city of Maceió, the homicide rate in 2011 stood at a whopping 111 per 100,000, according to the report. But Brazil's overflowing favelas are a symptom of larger problems that originate in places like Barra do Parateca, where waves of impoverished farmers, many if not most of them descended from slaves, have fled the countryside over the past half century. In 1950, the Brazilian census placed the urban population at 31 percent. As of 2013, that figure has climbed to 85 percent. Land is the one major factor that pushes Brazilians to leave the countryside and crowd into the packed cities. Like in Barra do Parateca, land is all but unobtainable with the wages most Brazilian farm workers make. ""The highly unequal distribution of land in Brazil is clearly an important reason that Brazil's cities have grown in such a rapid, unequal and violent way,"" Sean Mitchell, an anthropology professor at Rutgers University who studies quilombos, wrote in an email to HuffPost. While Mitchell thinks it would be ""impossible to roll back the haphazard and violent growth of Brazil's cities through reforms in the countryside,"" he added that ""land reform would significantly alleviate violence in the countryside."" Land seemed an impossible dream for Pereira until 2005, when he helped found a local organization dedicated to addressing racial inequality. While working with the group, he learned about the Brazilian Constitution's quilombo clause: that communities descended from runaway slaves were entitled to own the land they lived on. All he had to do to gain access to the land was form an official association, collect signatures from a majority of the town's residents and take them to the country's capital, Brasília, to apply. Pereira searched Barra do Parateca's history for evidence of its origins as a quilombo. Very little has been written about the tiny town, but he managed to find an account by a priest, published in 1991, that described the area's origins as a ""fazenda,"" or ranch, owned by a Portuguese family during the colonial period. According to the document, the family raised sugar cane and herded cattle using slave labor. ""Those were my ancestors,"" Pereira said. ""It was from that moment that we began to identify, we began to understand our origins."" He gathered signatures from more than half the town's residents and took the day-long bus ride to Brasilia to drop off the paperwork. The town became a certified quilombo in January 2006, and along with its status came a new school and health clinic. But quilombo certification only extends to the town itself. The coveted farmlands that surround Barra do Parateca remain the private property of assorted ranchers and farmers. And eight years after certification, the government has yet to publish the legally required technical study documenting Barra do Parateca's land claim, let alone negotiate indemnization with all the current landowners or transfer a title to Pereira and his community. Representatives from the Institute of Colonization and Land Reform, or INCRA, which carries out the titling process, say they're overburdened by the massive number of claims, which as of this year have reached 569 in the state of Bahia alone, according to federal government figures. Although the constitution guarantees quilombos' property rights, INCRA can't simply take chunks of land and hand them to new owners. Instead, it must compensate the titleholders, who generally resist the agency's attempts to take over their property, leading to lengthy legal disputes.""We can't expropriate land -- we also have to indemnify,"" Itamar Rangel at the INCRA's office in Salvador da Bahia told HuffPost. ""Brazilian law defends the property rights of any citizen."" That lack of efficiency isn't unique to the state of Bahia. INCRA estimates the total amount of land currently claimed by quilombos in Brazil to be around 4.4 million acres -- an area roughly the size of New Jersey. But the government has issued just 217 land titles as of this year, having granted only three last year and three in 2012. At this rate, the growing backlog that now stands at roughly 2,200 quilombos won't be getting cleared any time soon. In 2007, frustrated with the pace of Brazilian bureaucracy, Barra do Parateca's quilombo association stopped waiting and started planting. They planted along the river banks. They planted on land just outside the town. They rode boats up the river and walked into the forest to plant in isolated fields, setting up campsites along the way. Today, when the quilombo residents are able to harvest those crops, it helps supplement their modestly stocked pantries and refrigerators. The landowners usually fight back. As often as not, landowners find the clandestine fields and let cattle loose to feed on the crops before they're harvested. About a dozen landowners from Barra do Parateca are battling the quilombo association's claims. Of all those fights, none is more tense than the one involving the Pinto family. Hélio Pereira Pinto, 71, isn't the kind of person you'd imagine as one of the quilombo's biggest enemies. An aging man whose thick, sun-battered skin folds neatly along his cheeks, Pinto walks with a limp, the result of his father's inability to pay for a doctor when Pinto developed a benign tumor in his left knee at age 10. Although the tumor splintered his tibia, forcing shards of bone through his skin, he spent his life working as a field hand, one of the most backbreaking and poorly paid jobs Brazil has to offer. He still has scars under his arm from the years he worked in the fields while supporting himself with a crutch. He remembers listening to radio broadcasts from Cuba's Communist government in the 1960s, hoping that a similar revolution would make its way to Brazil. But his experiences in recent years have tempered his revolutionary enthusiasm. Pinto owns the piece of land where Pereira and his fellow quilombolas have arrived at their uneasy truce. His son João Batista Pinto -- a judge in the neighboring city of Guanambi who is entangled in a separate land dispute with the quilombo -- has repeatedly called the cops to kick them out. After the police destroyed the quilombo association's illicit crops in 2010, someone set a bus belonging to Hélio Pinto on fire. The Pinto family suspects retribution, but no one has owned up to the deed. Four years later, the bus's charred remains still sit on the town's main road, now engulfed by a tree that has grown around it. Land holds much the same meaning for Hélio Pinto, who is white, as it does for Pereira. The oldest of 18 children, Pinto was born less than two miles from Barra do Parateca, where his landless family lived on the property of a wealthier man named Antonio Bastos. Pinto's family worked as ""agregados,"" meaning they were allowed to live on the land and use a chunk of it to grow their own food, in exchange for their labor. Some experts have described the relationship, common in the Brazilian countryside, as something better than slavery, but not quite freedom. One day, for reasons unclear to Pinto, Bastos kicked the family out, along with his other agregados. Pinto's father found new work as an agregado on a ranch in what would become Barra do Parateca. This was in the early 1950s, and Barra wasn't yet a town -- just another tract of land owned by a wealthy ranching family. After decades of working the fields, Pinto scraped together enough money to buy the small patch of land that the quilombo association now disputes. The fighting has grown so frustrating for João Batista Pinto, Hélio's son, that he doesn't even want his parcel of land anymore. As a lawyer in the neighboring city of Guanambi, he now has little use for it, and the bad blood created by the land conflicts makes him feel uncomfortable visiting the town of his birth. He would gladly give it up, he says, if only someone would pay him for it. It's not the first time someone has tried to take over João Batista Pinto's small patch of land. In the 1970s, when Brazil was under military rule, the Bahian government unsuccessfully tried to relocate the town to accommodate a dam project. The INCRA expropriated a series of tracts in the area, including João Batista's. So the land, in theory, belongs to the government -- except that, as often happens with Brazil's slow-moving bureaucracy, INCRA never paid him for it. ""This case has been pending ever since then, until the present day,"" João Batista said. ""Without payment, without indemnization. This happens all over the place in Brazil."" Still, Hélio Pinto has trouble understanding how Barra do Parateca could possibly be a quilombo. As one of the few residents who's lived in the town since its establishment, he knows that the original inhabitants were, like him, virtually all white. Now, he says, the peaceful community he once knew has been torn apart, and the land he labored for has been made worthless by the political aspirations of black people from neighboring towns. ""There was never any quilombo here. There were never any slaves,"" Pinto said. ""Today most people here are black, there's no white people anymore. But the blacks are all migrants. None of them are really from here."" Many in the Brazilian media share the Pintos' suspicions about the authenticity of today's quilombos. Television coverage often tilts more toward his point of view than Pereira's. One of the most famous cases occurred in 2007, when Brazil's largest television news broadcaster, O Globo, visited the quilombo of São Francisco do Paraguaçú in the northern part of the country. O Globo's reporters asked residents if they considered themselves quilombolas. Several people said no. One man said he'd never heard of the term until recent years. Another said he'd never heard the term at all. In the final version of the story, the producers did not air the comments of the quilombo association's leaders or the interviewees who affirmed the existence of their quilombo. The story erroneously claimed that the area was not a historical site of slavery and that sugar had not been planted in the region when, in fact, the ruins of a colonial-era sugar mill lay just a short distance upriver. The report sparked protests in the community and deepened a rift that pitted neighbor against neighbor, with some residents posting signs in front of their doors reading ""I'm not a quilombola, no."" The federal government re-evaluated the community's anthropological report, but it eventually chose to uphold the group's quilombo certification.Despite the support of the government, episodes like this have undermined the public image of the fledgling social movement. Politicians who would go on to form Democráticos 25, a conservative, pro-market political party, hoped to take advantage of public doubts about quilombos' credibility. They filed a legal challenge in 2004, arguing that Lula da Silva's decree allowing virtually any group of black people to declare themselves a quilombo illegally skirted Congress' authority. By 2010, the case had made its way to Brazil's highest court, which has yet to rule on it. A decision in Democráticos 25's favor could annul all the land titles issued under the law and strip thousands of communities of their quilombo status overnight. Pereira doesn't dispute that Barra do Parateca was once a largely white community. He acknowledges that most of the town's black residents first arrived about four decades ago -- including his mother, who was born in a town on the other side of the river. But he also takes a wider view of his community's history. According to the priest's 1991 account, before the town existed, the area of Barra do Parateca belonged to one large Portuguese landowner whose massive holdings stretched across the hinterland. That man's claim encompassed a number of neighboring majority-black towns, including the first certified quilombo in the state of Bahia, Rio das Rãs. ""Before the community, before the town, it was a fazenda,"" Pereira said. ""So all of this black population here in the Parateca region -- Pau D'Arco, Barra do Parateca -- in reality, we're all the same people."" And anyway, all of this is beside the point, as far as Pereira is concerned. Fighting over these chunks of land for the last few years has made him rethink not just poverty, but race as well. ""Slavery was abolished,"" Pereira said. ""But the black people around here -- my ancestors -- never had a single title. Abolition happened, but we're practically continuing as if we were slaves today. How come we don't get the right to reparations?"" Brazilians' disagreement over how to define a quilombo stems in part from the country's historic reluctance to define who is black. People either partially or wholly of African descent make up a majority of the population, but unlike in the United States, Brazil never saw widespread legal segregation, and racial mixing has been common since the colonial period. That legacy has made it difficult for Brazilians to build political movements devoted to confronting racism. Many Brazilians view their country as a ""racial democracy,"" where the lack of strict distinctions between ""black"" and ""white"" has fostered an ethnically harmonious society. Yet Afro-Brazilian intellectuals and the country's social scientists have long dismissed that interpretation, pointing to research and statistics that they say reveal broad patterns of discrimination. As of 2011, Brazilian black and mixed-race workers on average earned only 60 percent of the salaries of white workers, according to the country's national statistics agency. Some 70 percent of homicide victims are black, according to a 2013 study by the Institute of Applied Economic Research. Researchers at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro calculated last year that if the Brazilian population were divided along racial lines, whites would occupy the 65th position on the U.N. Human Development Index, while Afro-Brazilians would only reach 102nd place. Given the expansiveness of Brazil's legal definition of ""quilombos,"" it's hard to mount an argument that Barra do Parateca does not qualify. More than half of the Barra do Parateca community signed the petition to declare its ethnic quilombo identity, as required. A social scientist visited the town and verified the claim. The lawsuits filed against the quilombo's land invasions would, theoretically, be trumped by a decision by INCRA to compensate the current landowners accordingly and seize the property on behalf of the quilombo. But INCRA's officials, 500 miles away in a building with a leaky ceiling, have yet to finalize the paperwork, let alone issue a land title. They're responsible for the nearly 600 quilombo claims across Bahia, some of which face crises more serious than Barra do Parateca's. Nevertheless, the lack of progress infuriates the already frustrated quilombo association. When asked who the quilombo movement's greatest enemy is, Pereira didn't mention the landowners. Instead, he began talking about the government, which catapulted the movement into existence in 1988, then let it founder, leaving quilombo residents to wonder whether the constitutional article will wither into a broken promise. ""The greatest enemy of the quilombo movement is the Brazilian state itself,"" Pereira said. ""The slowness."" João Batista Pinto's anger at the quilombo association is no longer what it was four years ago, when he sent the cops to break up its occupation of his land. He's now resigned to put up with the irritation of the land dispute while the courts and INCRA slowly sort the mess out. But like his father, he harbors resentment, and finds it laughable to think Barra do Parateca could be classified as a quilombo. ""It's an old concept,"" João Batista said. ""To apply it to the contemporary world is difficult. They're trying to apply that article in order to gain social benefits, but they're doing it fraudulently."" Recalling the old problem of how to define who is black in Brazil, João Batista pointed out that his sister Heldina looks white, and then asked rhetorically if he himself looks black. With his dark bronze skin and coarse straight hair, he could belong to any number of Brazil's intermingling ethnic combinations. In the United States, no one would call him white. João Batista added that he and his family come from Barra do Parateca. Does that make them quilombolas? ""It's not enough just to demonstrate the presence of a black population, because if that were all you needed, Salvador da Bahia would be a quilombo,"" he said. ""Bom Jesús da Lapa, Rio de Janeiro, all the other states. Brazil would be one giant quilombo."" In the meantime, Barra do Parateca waits, and Pereira enjoys his early morning walk around the roça while a friend hacks at weeds with a machete. The soil might be more moist if Hélio Pinto hadn't taken down the irrigation system he installed years ago. On the other hand, the cops haven't come this year to kick the quilombo out and destroy the small patch of plantings on the Pinto family's 15-acre plot. In his mother's kitchen, Pereira sits down to eat a cut of gristly beef with a side of rice, black beans and farofa, a yucca flour that Brazilians sprinkle on their food to add flavor and make it more filling. For Pereira, few things reveal more about Brazil's race relations than his meals. ""This is the way I see it, the world is what you're thinking about,"" said Pereira. ""If you're hungry, what are you going to think about? About food. So most of the world's poor only think about food. They go to school and they're thinking about snack time, about lunch, because those who are hungry only think about eating."" Pereira said he envies the United States, a country viewed by many Brazilians as more racist than their own, for electing a black president. Why, he asks, in his country, where people of color make up a majority of the population, does the idea of a black president seem beyond the realm of possibility? Like most quilombolas, Pereira isn't convinced that he lives in a racial democracy.""They say it's not, but Brazil is a racist country -- in all the ways that you could imagine,"" Pereira said, pointing to the skin on his forearm. ""In Brazil, poverty has a color.""The reporting for this project was made possible by a Social Justice Reporting for a Global America fellowship from the International Center for Journalists."

Read the first part here.The dry grass crackled under Almir Vieira Pereira's shoes as he walked along the edges of the roça, a small patch of land he's been fighting to plant on for years. He grabbed a handful of soil and watched it puff into a smoky cloud as it settled back to the ground. Brazil's northeastern backlands are known for their dryness. Perennial droughts have sent generations of northeasterners fleeing from impoverished farming towns like this one for the industrial cities of the South -- São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte. Barra do Parateca's soil had yet to recover from last year's lack of rain. But dry or not, the ability to walk freely across this field marked a major victory for Pereira. He and a group of slave descendants from the roughly 1,500-person hamlet of Barra do Parateca have spent the last five years invading chunks of land across the area that they say are rightfully theirs under a well-known but haphazardly enforced article of the Brazilian Constitution.

""It was from that moment that we began to identify, we began to understand our origins."" He gathered signatures from more than half the town's residents and took the day-long bus ride to Brasilia to drop off the paperwork. The town became a certified quilombo in January 2006, and along with its status came a new school and health clinic. But quilombo certification only extends to the town itself. The coveted farmlands that surround Barra do Parateca remain the private property of assorted ranchers and farmers. And eight years after certification, the government has yet to publish the legally required technical study documenting Barra do Parateca's land claim, let alone negotiate indemnization with all the current landowners or transfer a title to Pereira and his community. Representatives from the Institute of Colonization and Land Reform, or INCRA, which carries out the titling process, say they're overburdened by the massive number of claims, which as of this year have reached 569 in the state of Bahia alone, according to federal government figures. Although the constitution guarantees quilombos' property rights, INCRA can't simply take chunks of land and hand them to new owners. Instead, it must compensate the titleholders, who generally resist the agency's attempts to take over their property, leading to lengthy legal disputes.""We can't expropriate land -- we also have to indemnify,"" Itamar Rangel at the INCRA's office in Salvador da Bahia told HuffPost. ""Brazilian law defends the property rights of any citizen."" That lack of efficiency isn't unique to the state of Bahia. INCRA estimates the total amount of land currently claimed by quilombos in Brazil to be around 4.4 million acres -- an area roughly the size of New Jersey. But the government has issued just 217 land titles as of this year, having granted only three last year and three in 2012. At this rate, the growing backlog that now stands at roughly 2,200 quilombos won't be getting cleared any time soon. In 2007, frustrated with the pace of Brazilian bureaucracy, Barra do Parateca's quilombo association stopped waiting and started planting. They planted along the river banks. They planted on land just outside the town. They rode boats up the river and walked into the forest to plant in isolated fields, setting up campsites along the way. Today, when the quilombo residents are able to harvest those crops, it helps supplement their modestly stocked pantries and refrigerators. The landowners usually fight back. As often as not, landowners find the clandestine fields and let cattle loose to feed on the crops before they're harvested. About a dozen landowners from Barra do Parateca are battling the quilombo association's claims. Of all those fights, none is more tense than the one involving the Pinto family. Hélio Pereira Pinto, 71, isn't the kind of person you'd imagine as one of the quilombo's biggest enemies. An aging man whose thick, sun-battered skin folds neatly along his cheeks, Pinto walks with a limp, the result of his father's inability to pay for a doctor when Pinto developed a benign tumor in his left knee at age 10. Although the tumor splintered his tibia, forcing shards of bone through his skin, he spent his life working as a field hand, one of the most backbreaking and poorly paid jobs Brazil has to offer. He still has scars under his arm from the years he worked in the fields while supporting himself with a crutch. He remembers listening to radio broadcasts from Cuba's Communist government in the 1960s, hoping that a similar revolution would make its way to Brazil. But his experiences in recent years have tempered his revolutionary enthusiasm. Pinto owns the piece of land where Pereira and his fellow quilombolas have arrived at their uneasy truce. His son João Batista Pinto -- a judge in the neighboring city of Guanambi who is entangled in a separate land dispute with the quilombo -- has repeatedly called the cops to kick them out. After the police destroyed the quilombo association's illicit crops in 2010, someone set a bus belonging to Hélio Pinto on fire. The Pinto family suspects retribution, but no one has owned up to the deed. Four years later, the bus's charred remains still sit on the town's main road, now engulfed by a tree that has grown around it. Land holds much the same meaning for Hélio Pinto, who is white, as it does for Pereira. The oldest of 18 children, Pinto was born less than two miles from Barra do Parateca, where his landless family lived on the property of a wealthier man named Antonio Bastos. Pinto's family worked as ""agregados,"" meaning they were allowed to live on the land and use a chunk of it to grow their own food, in exchange for their labor. Some experts have described the relationship, common in the Brazilian countryside, as something better than slavery, but not quite freedom. One day, for reasons unclear to Pinto, Bastos kicked the family out, along with his other agregados. Pinto's father found new work as an agregado on a ranch in what would become Barra do Parateca. This was in the early 1950s, and Barra wasn't yet a town -- just another tract of land owned by a wealthy ranching family. After decades of working the fields, Pinto scraped together enough money to buy the small patch of land that the quilombo association now disputes. The fighting has grown so frustrating for João Batista Pinto, Hélio's son, that he doesn't even want his parcel of land anymore. As a lawyer in the neighboring city of Guanambi, he now has little use for it, and the bad blood created by the land conflicts makes him feel uncomfortable visiting the town of his birth. He would gladly give it up, he says, if only someone would pay him for it. It's not the first time someone has tried to take over João Batista Pinto's small patch of land. In the 1970s, when Brazil was under military rule, the Bahian government unsuccessfully tried to relocate the town to accommodate a dam project. The INCRA expropriated a series of tracts in the area, including João Batista's. So the land, in theory, belongs to the government -- except that, as often happens with Brazil's slow-moving bureaucracy, INCRA never paid him for it. ""This case has been pending ever since then, until the present day,"" João Batista said. ""Without payment, without indemnization. This happens all over the place in Brazil."" Still, Hélio Pinto has trouble understanding how Barra do Parateca could possibly be a quilombo. As one of the few residents who's lived in the town since its establishment, he knows that the original inhabitants were, like him, virtually all white. Now, he says, the peaceful community he once knew has been torn apart, and the land he labored for has been made worthless by the political aspirations of black people from neighboring towns. ""There was never any quilombo here. There were never any slaves,"" Pinto said. ""Today most people here are black, there's no white people anymore. But the blacks are all migrants. None of them are really from here."" Many in the Brazilian media share the Pintos' suspicions about the authenticity of today's quilombos. Television coverage often tilts more toward his point of view than Pereira's. One of the most famous cases occurred in 2007, when Brazil's largest television news broadcaster, O Globo, visited the quilombo of São Francisco do Paraguaçú in the northern part of the country. O Globo's reporters asked residents if they considered themselves quilombolas. Several people said no. One man said he'd never heard of the term until recent years. Another said he'd never heard the term at all. In the final version of the story, the producers did not air the comments of the quilombo association's leaders or the interviewees who affirmed the existence of their quilombo. The story erroneously claimed that the area was not a historical site of slavery and that sugar had not been planted in the region when, in fact, the ruins of a colonial-era sugar mill lay just a short distance upriver. The report sparked protests in the community and deepened a rift that pitted neighbor against neighbor, with some residents posting signs in front of their doors reading ""I'm not a quilombola, no."" The federal government re-evaluated the community's anthropological report, but it eventually chose to uphold the group's quilombo certification.Despite the support of the government, episodes like this have undermined the public image of the fledgling social movement. Politicians who would go on to form Democráticos 25, a conservative, pro-market political party, hoped to take advantage of public doubts about quilombos' credibility. They filed a legal challenge in 2004, arguing that Lula da Silva's decree allowing virtually any group of black people to declare themselves a quilombo illegally skirted Congress' authority. By 2010, the case had made its way to Brazil's highest court, which has yet to rule on it. A decision in Democráticos 25's favor could annul all the land titles issued under the law and strip thousands of communities of their quilombo status overnight. Pereira doesn't dispute that Barra do Parateca was once a largely white community. He acknowledges that most of the town's black residents first arrived about four decades ago -- including his mother, who was born in a town on the other side of the river. But he also takes a wider view of his community's history. According to the priest's 1991 account, before the town existed, the area of Barra do Parateca belonged to one large Portuguese landowner whose massive holdings stretched across the hinterland. That man's claim encompassed a number of neighboring majority-black towns, including the first certified quilombo in the state of Bahia, Rio das Rãs. ""Before the community, before the town, it was a fazenda,"" Pereira said. ""So all of this black population here in the Parateca region -- Pau D'Arco, Barra do Parateca -- in reality, we're all the same people."" And anyway, all of this is beside the point, as far as Pereira is concerned. Fighting over these chunks of land for the last few years has made him rethink not just poverty, but race as well. ""Slavery was abolished,"" Pereira said. ""But the black people around here -- my ancestors -- never had a single title. Abolition happened, but we're practically continuing as if we were slaves today. How come we don't get the right to reparations?"" Brazilians' disagreement over how to define a quilombo stems in part from the country's historic reluctance to define who is black. People either partially or wholly of African descent make up a majority of the population, but unlike in the United States, Brazil never saw widespread legal segregation, and racial mixing has been common since the colonial period. That legacy has made it difficult for Brazilians to build political movements devoted to confronting racism. Many Brazilians view their country as a ""racial democracy,"" where the lack of strict distinctions between ""black"" and ""white"" has fostered an ethnically harmonious society. Yet Afro-Brazilian intellectuals and the country's social scientists have long dismissed that interpretation, pointing to research and statistics that they say reveal broad patterns of discrimination. As of 2011, Brazilian black and mixed-race workers on average earned only 60 percent of the salaries of white workers, according to the country's national statistics agency. Some 70 percent of homicide victims are black, according to a 2013 study by the Institute of Applied Economic Research. Researchers at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro calculated last year that if the Brazilian population were divided along racial lines, whites would occupy the 65th position on the U.N. Human Development Index, while Afro-Brazilians would only reach 102nd place. Given the expansiveness of Brazil's legal definition of ""quilombos,"" it's hard to mount an argument that Barra do Parateca does not qualify. More than half of the Barra do Parateca community signed the petition to declare its ethnic quilombo identity, as required. A social scientist visited the town and verified the claim. The lawsuits filed against the quilombo's land invasions would, theoretically, be trumped by a decision by INCRA to compensate the current landowners accordingly and seize the property on behalf of the quilombo. But INCRA's officials, 500 miles away in a building with a leaky ceiling, have yet to finalize the paperwork, let alone issue a land title. They're responsible for the nearly 600 quilombo claims across Bahia, some of which face crises more serious than Barra do Parateca's. Nevertheless, the lack of progress infuriates the already frustrated quilombo association. When asked who the quilombo movement's greatest enemy is, Pereira didn't mention the landowners. Instead, he began talking about the government, which catapulted the movement into existence in 1988, then let it founder, leaving quilombo residents to wonder whether the constitutional article will wither into a broken promise. ""The greatest enemy of the quilombo movement is the Brazilian state itself,"" Pereira said. ""The slowness."" João Batista Pinto's anger at the quilombo association is no longer what it was four years ago, when he sent the cops to break up its occupation of his land. He's now resigned to put up with the irritation of the land dispute while the courts and INCRA slowly sort the mess out. But like his father, he harbors resentment, and finds it laughable to think Barra do Parateca could be classified as a quilombo. ""It's an old concept,"" João Batista said. ""To apply it to the contemporary world is difficult. They're trying to apply that article in order to gain social benefits, but they're doing it fraudulently."" Recalling the old problem of how to define who is black in Brazil, João Batista pointed out that his sister Heldina looks white, and then asked rhetorically if he himself looks black. With his dark bronze skin and coarse straight hair, he could belong to any number of Brazil's intermingling ethnic combinations. In the United States, no one would call him white. João Batista added that he and his family come from Barra do Parateca. Does that make them quilombolas? ""It's not enough just to demonstrate the presence of a black population, because if that were all you needed, Salvador da Bahia would be a quilombo,"" he said. ""Bom Jesús da Lapa, Rio de Janeiro, all the other states. Brazil would be one giant quilombo."" In the meantime, Barra do Parateca waits, and Pereira enjoys his early morning walk around the roça while a friend hacks at weeds with a machete. The soil might be more moist if Hélio Pinto hadn't taken down the irrigation system he installed years ago. On the other hand, the cops haven't come this year to kick the quilombo out and destroy the small patch of plantings on the Pinto family's 15-acre plot. In his mother's kitchen, Pereira sits down to eat a cut of gristly beef with a side of rice, black beans and farofa, a yucca flour that Brazilians sprinkle on their food to add flavor and make it more filling. For Pereira, few things reveal more about Brazil's race relations than his meals. ""This is the way I see it, the world is what you're thinking about,"" said Pereira. ""If you're hungry, what are you going to think about? About food. So most of the world's poor only think about food. They go to school and they're thinking about snack time, about lunch, because those who are hungry only think about eating."" Pereira said he envies the United States, a country viewed by many Brazilians as more racist than their own, for electing a black president. Why, he asks, in his country, where people of color make up a majority of the population, does the idea of a black president seem beyond the realm of possibility? Like most quilombolas, Pereira isn't convinced that he lives in a racial democracy.""They say it's not, but Brazil is a racist country -- in all the ways that you could imagine,"" Pereira said, pointing to the skin on his forearm. ""In Brazil, poverty has a color.""The reporting for this project was made possible by a Social Justice Reporting for a Global America fellowship from the International Center for Journalists."

Tens of thousands of Yazidi, who practice their own religion and are neither Christian nor Muslim, have fled targeted violence from ISIS Muslim Sunni fighters in the region of northern Iraq that borders Syria and Kurdish regions. An estimated 90,000 Yazidi live in Germany, more than in any other country in Europe. According to offical police sources, more than 10.000 demonstraters participated in the rally. (Photo by Alexander Koerner/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7ede62400005100572815.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Kris Ozar, 37, is in charge of programming for Catholic Relief Services in Egypt and is now in northern Iraq coordinating the charity’s emergency efforts with other groups, such as Caritas Iraq. He has been working with Christians and Yazidis forced to choose between conversion to Islam or death by the Islamic State.Ozar spoke with Religion News Service’s Kimberly Winston from Irbil, Iraq, about the challenges refugees face. Some answers have been edited for length and clarity.Q: The Christian and Yazidi refugees have been rescued from Mount Sinjar. What is the situation where you are right now?A: From my window, I can see a church compound and it is filled with tents and there are hundreds of people inside those tents. Everyone talked about getting (the displaced people) off Mount Sinjar, and that was an amazing challenge, but what we forget is that the most amazing challenge lies ahead.Two Yazidis I spoke with yesterday highlight that. One was a man whose entire family is missing. He pulled out his smartphone and started flipping through his pictures. “Dash, dash, dash,” he said as he was showing me his wife, his father, his brother, his niece. “Gone, gone, gone.” This is a man who is trying to start his life over in an abandoned house with four other families and searching for how he can mentally and physically start his life over.Q: How do CRS and other relief agencies help people who have lost so much?A: In the short term, we can provide essential food and nonfood items and sanitary services and provide them with shelter. But then we have to ask how do we get them into dignified living conditions? How do we get the children back into school? How do we work with this population to identify the trauma they all have gone through, and how do we help them to restart their lives in new communities? This is a long-term mission. Yes, they are out of harm’s way, but winter is coming and we have hundreds of thousands of people sleeping in tents — if they’re lucky.Q: You have worked in other refugee hotspots around the world — Ghana, Tanzania and Kenya among them. What, if anything, is unique to the situation among the Yazidis and Christians?A: The Yazidi are one of the poorest communities in the country. A good part of them ran with only the clothes on their back. These communities were just caught off guard. They were stripped of everything they had.Q: What would you most like people to know about the situation there that has not been played up in the media?A: It’s been quite beautiful to see the solidarity of the local communities and charitable organizations coming out. While organizations like CRS and Caritas Iraq were getting started here, local Iraqis were going to the store and buying water and cooking meals for people and just pulling up to parks and other places where people were sleeping and serving meals out of the backs of their cars. And it wasn’t just the wealthy Iraqis, it was all of them playing their part.Q: What is the long-term future for the refugees?A: It isn’t just getting people off Mount Sinjar. That was essential and it was horrific, but now it is about the next chapters. How do we accompany these populations to help them rebuild? That is not a box you can tick by sending emergency relief or through one-time government grants. CRS and Caritas Iraq and others are committed to developing a plan on how we can accompany these people. We need to continue to remind ourselves of the plight of the Iraqi people. The machine is in motion, we can help and we can make a difference for the Christians and the Yazhidi as well."
