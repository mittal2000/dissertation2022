2,COLLEGE,Paul Nungesser's Suit Against Columbia Over Mattress Protest Is Dismissed,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-nungesser-lawsuit-dismissed_us_56e43ae7e4b0b25c91822496,"Emma Sulkowicz's art project received international attention, and he insists the school should have done something about it.",2016-03-12,Paul Nungesser sued Columbia University for not stopping Emma Sulkowicz's activism about how her sexual assault complaint against him was handled by the school.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e4479a1e00008700703ed2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A federal lawsuit from a former male Columbia University student alleging the Ivy League school failed to stop harassment from classmates who accused him of rape was dismissed on Friday. Paul Nungesser was accused of sexual misconduct by Emma Sulkowicz, two other female students and one male student. None of the accusations the students filed with Columbia resulted in the university's finding Nungesser ""responsible."" Nungesser has maintained he had consensual sex with Sulkowicz and went public with his side of the story in multiple news outlets during the 2014-2015 school year. In April 2015, Nungesser sued Columbia and an art professor for not stopping what he called harassment by Sulkowicz as she became a prominent activist on campus and started a public demonstration of carrying around a mattress until Nungesser was expelled or left.U.S. District Court Judge Gregory H. Woods on Friday granted Columbia's motion to dismiss the suit but left open an option for Nungesser to try again. He wrote that Nungesser had failed to state a claim under Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. ""Nungesser does not allege that Sulkowicz ever attempted to touch him, spoke to him, followed him, or otherwise interacted with him after the October 2013 hearing,"" Woods wrote in his opinion. ""Nor does he allege that she ever used his name in any of her public statements.""The dismissal is the latest in a trend of failed lawsuits from male students accused of sexual assault who say their colleges mistreated them under Title IX.The court rejected that Nungesser had his rights violated under the gender equity law, in part because it rejected that calling someone a ""rapist, falsely or not,"" is a gendered term. Woods wrote:[Nungesser] assumes that because the allegations against him concerned a sexual act that everything that follows from it is “sex-based” within the meaning of Title IX. He is wrong. Taken to its logical extreme, Nungesser’s position would lead to the conclusion that those who commit, or are accused of committing, sexual assault are a protected class under Title IX. The statute does not permit that result.The suit complained that Nungesser's parents notified Columbia of an impending December 2013 article in the New York Post about the cases against him, ""but that no action was taken in response."" In January 2014, a student publication called the Blue & White published a similar story and Columbia advised Nungesser not to comment for the piece, the suit said. Neither story identified Nungesser by name, and both alleged that Columbia mishandled the cases. Sulkowicz first went public at an April 2014 press conference with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) but didn't identify Nungesser. His name was first made public in a May 2014 Columbia Spectator article, and appeared on a list of ""sexual assault violators"" that appeared in campus bathrooms. In the 2014-15 academic year, Sulkowicz began carrying a mattress around campus in an art activism project called ""Carry That Weight,"" saying that she would do so until her ""rapist was off campus."" She later followed up with other art projects that used newspaper clippings of media coverage of her mattress protest. While Nungesser complained that he was denied a security escort on two occasions during that school year, the court also said he did not have his access to educational opportunities disrupted. The court also rejected Nungesser's complaint that Columbia failed to enforce confidentiality rules because there was no evidence that the university disclosed information about his case. Several other claims by Nungesser were also dismissed. Woods said Nungesser can file a second amended complaint with respect to certain claims, including that Columbia was guilty of intentional infliction of emotional distress and failing to uphold its policy against retaliation. He can also replead his Title IX claims -- in other words, the court told him to essentially try again if he'd like. Philip A. Byler, an attorney representing Nungesser, said they plan to do just that. He promised the public will hear more from their team on Woods' interpretation of Title IX.""We very much believe in Paul Nungesser's case and further believe that a dismissal decision would represent a very, very erroneous interpretation and application of, [among other things], Title IX,"" Byler told HuffPost in an email Saturday.Columbia did not immediately respond to request for comment. Sulkowicz faced highly public harassment in the 2014-15 school year from people who believed she lied about the assault. _______Tyler Kingkade is a national reported based in New York, and covers higher education and sexual violence.

3,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton's Response To Honduran Coup Was Scrubbed From Her Paperback Memoirs,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-honduras-coup-memoirs_us_56e34161e4b0b25c91820a08,Critics argue the secretary of state's efforts paved the way for the violence still plaguing Honduras.,2016-03-12,Former President Manuel Zelaya returned to the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa in May 2011 under an amnesty deal.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e34383150000ad000b1c6c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Those who want to know what former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said about Honduras' 2009 coup in her autobiography shouldn't bother with the paperback version.Clinton's role in the aftermath of Honduran President Manuel Zelaya's ouster has come under greater scrutiny since the March 3 assassination of environmental and indigenous rights activist Berta Cáceres. Critics argue that the U.S. push for new elections in the months after the coup helped legitimize the actions of the Honduran military, destabilize the country and pave the way for the extreme violence that followed. Killings of activists like Cáceres and others have become devastatingly common.But the account Clinton offered of her response to the coup in her memoir Hard Choices was omitted from last year's paperback edition.In June 2009, Zelaya was overthrown by the Honduran military, ushered out of the presidential palace at gunpoint wearing only his pajamas. Months of protests against the de facto government led by Roberto Micheletti followed. While virtually all Latin American governments condemned the coup and called for Zelaya's restoration, Clinton and the U.S. pushed for elections to bring in a new government -- a position she detailed in the hardcover edition of Hard Choices, published in 2014.Days after the coup, she wrote, she teamed up with Mexican Foreign Secretary Patricia Espinosa to come up with a response.""We strategized on a plan to restore order in Honduras and ensure that free and fair elections could be held quickly and legitimately, which would render the question of Zelaya moot and give the Honduran people a chance to choose their own future,"" Clinton wrote.But that paragraph -- indeed, the entire two-page discussion of the Honduran coup -- disappeared from the paperback edition. In the paperback version, the chapter on Latin America ends abruptly after a look at the debate over whether Cuba should be included in the Organization of American States. The deletion was first noted in an essay by Belén Fernández in the forthcoming book False Choices: The Faux Feminism of Hillary Rodham Clinton that was cited in The Nation.It's a striking cut, given that Zelaya was overthrown just three weeks after Clinton's visit to Honduras for the OAS meeting at which Cuba's membership was debated, which she recounts as the penultimate anecdote of the Latin America chapter.When asked about the edit, a Clinton spokeswoman pointed The Huffington Post to the front flap of the paperback edition, which notes generally that the text has been trimmed.""A limited number of sections from the hardcover edition have been cut to accommodate a shorter length for this edition. Those sections remain available in the ebook edition,"" it says.The omission seems especially problematic in light of Cacéres' death last week. The high-profile activist was well known for opposing construction of the Agua Zarca Dam, which would have forced indigenous Lenca people to leave land they consider sacred. She was killed by unidentified gunmen after receiving a series of threats.In the hardcover edition of her memoir, Clinton trumpets the resolution of the coup through a new round of elections as a triumph for regional diplomacy.Honduras plunged into a period of extreme violence after the coup, as the de facto government suppressed protests with force. Even after a new elected president took office in early 2010, drug cartels exploited the confusion to solidify their control over trafficking routes to the U.S., and political violence made activism a deadly enterprise.More than 100 environmental and land rights activists like Cáceres were killed in Honduras from 2010 to 2015, according to the British organization Global Witness. The country became the homicide capital of the world for several years, with a murder rate topping 90 per 100,000 at its peak in 2011, according to the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime.""Hillary [Clinton] and the State Department only wanted the kind of 'stability' that was convenient for them regardless of what was happening on the ground,” Cáceres' nephew Silvio Carrillo said in an email to HuffPost. ""This has not changed today and it is the reason you now have had governments operating with impunity.""Asked about the omission of the coup passage from Clinton's memoir, Carrillo accused her of ""attempting to scrub away the blood she's helped to spill along with the Department of Defense and the Department of State.""Cáceres herself cast blame on Clinton for legitimizing the coup after the fact by supporting new elections instead of pressing to restore the Zelaya administration, according to a 2014 video interview unearthed by New York University historian Greg Grandin.""We were fighting a coup d'etat that we couldn't overcome,"" Cáceres said. ""Those who overthrew the government are still there."" She contended that in Hard Choices, Clinton was ""practically saying what was going to happen in Honduras. This demonstrates a bad North American interference in our country.""Watch the 2014 interview in Spanish below: Grandin, who wrote about Clinton's response to the 2009 coup in The Nation last week, told HuffPost that her work on Honduras should be a campaign issue and that the assassination of Cáceres should force a ""reckoning with history."" ""They legitimated this coup regime,"" Grandin said. ""The U.S. could have adopted a real multilateral position and joined with Brazil, for instance, in demanding the restoration of Zelaya.""Instead, the U.S. opted to sideline Zelaya and back elections that brought in a conservative government. ""That's fairly clear between her emails and her own concession in Hard Choices. She took credit for that. Before she was called on it, she was holding it up as a signature achievement,"" he said.The emails to which Grandin referred were made public last year and show that Clinton sought to avoid discussing the resolution of the Honduran coup at the OAS, where many regional governments supported Zelaya's restoration, and instead pressed for the mediation she helped arrange in Costa Rica.Clinton's director of Hispanic media, Jorge Silva, dismissed such criticism as ""nonsense,"" according to Latino USA. Silva said that ""Hillary Clinton engaged in active diplomacy that resolved a constitutional crisis and paved the way for legitimate democratic elections."""
4,BUSINESS,The Financial Crisis Film 'Boom Bust Boom' Falls Prey To The Big Problem It Addresses,Shane Ferro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/boom-bust-boom-review_us_56e3064be4b065e2e3d5ceb3,Our biases nearly always get the best of us.,2016-03-12,Terry Jones with a puppet of 20th century economist Hyman Minsky.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e32fee1e00008700703e37.jpeg?ops=crop_0_241_3500_2014%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Can a group of portly, middle-aged puppets explain the financial crisis?They certainly can try.In the new Terry Jones documentary, ""Boom Bust Boom,"" which premiered Friday in New York City, the Monty Python comedian uses puppets, cartoons and interviews with real people to turn a difficult and often boring subject into a lively lesson on history and the human biases that drive huge swings in the economy. Think of it as a whimsical version of ""The Big Short."" Set for a national release on March 18, the film shows how markets can boom and bust with regularity. Over the course of centuries, we see this cycle play out over and over, and yet, before each bust, we learn how people convince themselves this time is different. It's frustrating. Why can't humans just get it right? Unfortunately, the film falls prey to its own thesis, almost shutting out the voices of anyone who isn't a middle-aged white man, leading to a narrow view of this complex topic. It's not very helpful for thinking critically about how we might change things, and perhaps that's why the film offers few solutions.""Boom Bust Boom"" is at its best when illustrating some of history's worst economic meltdowns. It has informative and fun depictions of the 1637 tulip mania in the Netherlands, the crash of the South Sea Company in early 18th-century Britain, and the 19th-century speculation in (and fantastic crash of) British railroad stock. It also describes how the heights of speculation in the 1920s led to the lows of the Great Depression, and, finally, the hard lessons of the 2008 mortgage crisis. Every time is the same: Euphoria over rising prices leads to speculation, which ends with a crash.Humans are not rational, the movie tells us. We are hardwired, from the time of our primate ancestors, to have certain biases and blind spots. When it comes to capitalism, those blind spots lead to financial crises. And when someone sees the issue clearly, they are often disregarded until long after it's too late.The problem is, the film doesn't take the next step and ask why policymakers and economists continue to think the same way and follow the same patterns from one crisis to another.Here's one reason: The world's top economists (and government officials) more or less all have the same background. They went to a handful of schools, studied under a few dozen of the same professors, have read the same books and mingle in the same circles. Oh, and, to a large extent, they're all white and male. That doesn't encourage diversity of thought. Neither does this film. I counted about a dozen puppets woven into the story, and nearly all of them depicted middle-aged (or older) white men. Activist-actor and Huffington Post blogger John Cusack makes several somewhat puzzling appearances in this movie, too. (No disrespect to Mr. Cusack.) Women and minorities are almost entirely left out of this film -- not unlike the way they've been left out of financial and economics professions. Yet, we know that women are slightly better at managing financial risk than men are. Study after study over the last five years has found that female financial managers consistently outperform their male peers. They think differently.The two expert women the movie manages to talk to are Lucy Prebble, a playwright who once wrote a play about the collapse of Enron, and Laurie Santos, a Yale psychology professor who studies how monkeys make decisions. Neither have a background in economics, or in the 2008 crisis. But there is a long list of people -- who aren't white men -- who would have made great interview subjects for the filmmakers.Where was Christina Romer, who wrote a paper in 2015 examining the impact of financial crises on advanced economies? Where was Brooksley Born, who warned against the danger of unregulated derivatives -- which ended up creating the 2008 financial crisis -- when she was head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission in the 1990s? Where was Harvard economist Carmen Reinhart, who literally wrote a book called This Time is Different: Eight Centuries of Financial Folly? Where was Raghuram Rajan, India's top central banker, who warned of a potential financial crash way back in 2005, when he was working at the International Monetary Fund? If the world is to develop a framework for thinking differently about economics, it might help to start with more diverse sources."
5,SCIENCE,What's Happening In Your Brain During 'Microsleep',Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/microsleep-brain-sleep-deprivation_us_56d9ed81e4b0ffe6f8e958e6,Here's what you need to know about one of the most dangerous consequences of sleep deprivation.,2016-03-12,Microsleep can cause you to nod off at the computer for just a few seconds.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d9f2db1e0000c60070f500.jpeg?cache=SuNwL67tU1&ops=crop_0_913_3617_1842%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"We've all experienced it: You're completely exhausted after pulling an all-nighter, and despite your best efforts to stay awake, your eyelids keep closing and closing until suddenly you nod off for just a second -- only to awake with a jerk. This phenomenon is what's known as ""microsleep,"" a momentary and involuntary pocket of temporary unconsciousness lasting from a fraction of a second up to roughly 10 seconds, ending in a sudden head jolt. Why does our brain enter these periods of microsleep? They're typically caused by extreme fatigue. Sleep is a basic biological necessity, and when we force ourselves to go without it for too long, the brain will eventually shut down -- even if just for a few seconds. During microsleep, your brain is essentially taking a forced nap, because its current level of sleep deprivation is preventing certain areas and networks from functioning. Here's a look at the science of microsleep -- and why it can be so dangerous.It's your brain's losing struggle between sleep and wakefulness. In the battle to stay awake, sometimes your brain loses. A study published in the journal Neuroimage investigated microsleep by keeping a group of volunteers awake for 22 hours. The volunteers were then put in a dark fMRI machine and asked not to fall asleep. The brain scanner detected when they nodded off periodically, and looked at what was going on in their brains. During these bursts of microsleep, there was reduced activity in the thalamus, a region of the brain involved in regulating sleep.Interestingly, there was also increased activity in brain regions responsible for sensory processing and paying attention -- functions that are, of course, critical to wakefulness. This suggests that parts of the brain are in ""waking"" mode while other areas temporarily succumb to the urge to sleep. You may not even be aware of it happening. While sleep deprivation affects the whole brain, it's possible for certain parts of the brain to be affected much more severely. During microsleep, certain parts of the brain can nod off while others remain active. A 2011 University of Wisconsin study found that some nerve cells in a sleep-deprived but awake brain can go briefly ""offline,"" entering a sleep-like state while the rest of the brain remains awake. ""We know that when we are sleepy, we make mistakes, our attention wanders and our vigilance goes down,"" Dr. Chiara Cirelli, a professor of psychiatry at the university and one of the study's authors, said in a statement at the time. ""We have seen with EEGs that even while we are awake, we can experience short periods of 'microsleep.'""It's a frighteningly common factor in drowsy driving accidents. Perhaps the most troubling aspect of microsleep episodes is that they're common at the wheel, and they can lead to accidents. In fact, microsleep has been said to be the most common cause of falling asleep behind the wheel. According to the U.K. road safety charity Brake, 45 percent of men and 22 percent of women surveyed admitted to microsleeping while driving. Shift workers driving home after night shifts are at a high risk for crashes caused by microsleep. A small study published in December found that night shift workers are significantly more likely to have a crash when they're coming off a shift as compared to when they're fully rested, largely due to microsleep. An alarming study conducted in 2012 found that many of these accidents could have been prevented if drivers got off the road at the early signs of drowsiness. The findings showed that many people continue driving drowsily even after they experience microsleep episodes. ""People may know they are too sleepy to drive safely but they are pushing themselves to stay awake,"" Dr. Chris Watling, study author and researcher at the Queensland University of Technology in Australia, said in a 2012 statement. ""That's when we can get into difficulty with driving."""

And when you're chronically exhausted, everything in life is more difficult. You simply can't be fully healthy without enough sleep.",2016-03-12,"USA, New Jersey, Elevated view of young woman sleeping in bed",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9f3bc92000004e00feae06.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It is National Sleep Awareness Week and reflecting on the importance of this basic act is timely. As a preventive cardiologist, I work with patients who want to improve their health and lengthen their lives. Many of them have major risk factors for heart disease; others already have full-blown heart disease or have experienced major cardiac events such as heart attack, angina, or bypass surgery. These people want to change their future health; they see the writing on the wall, and they don't like what it is telling them. Traditionally patients who want to improve their heart health have received four main suggestions from their doctors: Eat a healthy diet, get more exercise, quit smoking, and enjoy moderate alcohol intake. Plenty of research backs up these four pillars of advice: Large studies have found that making improvements in these four areas lowers the chance of dying of heart disease by 67 percent. But lately, researchers are starting to recognize that there should be five recommendations on that list, not just four. They're discovering that getting enough sleep is a powerful health protector as well. When researchers include adequate sleep in their studies as a fifth cardio-preventive behavior change, they find that it lowers the chance of dying from heart disease even more: Adding a good seven hours a night of sleep in addition to making positive changes in diet, exercise, smoking, and alcohol intake lowers the chance of dying of heart disease by a whopping 83 percent. When that news started coming out, doctors began tagging sleep onto their list of recommended health behavior changes. But I don't think sleep belongs at the bottom of the list -- I think it should be at the top! I believe that getting enough sleep -- at least seven to eight hours per night for most people -- is the most important health behavior change you can make to improve your cardiac health and your overall health.  That's right: I recommend that if you make just one change to benefit the health of your heart and the rest of your body, that change should be getting a good sevent hours of sleep each night. Sleep is such an effective way to boost health that I make it my no. 1 health recommendation. Getting the sleep you need offers a big dose of protection from heart disease -- the number one killer in the United States -- as well as many other health threats, from cancer to diabetes to depression. Sure, I'd prefer that everyone make all of the Big Five lifestyle changes. But if I could only choose one of those, I'd pick sleep, because when you are well-rested, everything else in life is easier. When you get the sleep you need, you have more power to make the right choices about what you eat and drink. You have more energy to exercise. And you have the resilience you need to kick bad habits such as smoking and overeating. It all comes down to this: When you're well-rested you can do almost anything. And when you're chronically exhausted, everything in life is more difficult. You simply can't be fully healthy without enough sleep."

What was she thinking in 2009 when, as Secretary of State, she went to Switzerland to help UBS -- one of the most powerful banks in the world - and cut a sweetheart deal with the IRS to protect tens of thousands of US customers with secret bank accounts? Following her help, UBS paid Bill Clinton $1.5 million in speaking fees. And what was she thinking when she retired from public service, walked right through the revolving door to Wall Street (That would be the same guys she bailed out in 2008) and collected six figure speaking fees in addition to the whopping donations that lined her super PAC in preparation for her presidential campaign? There is no single experience that can prepare a person to be president of the United States. Instead, we should look for a candidate with a proven record of good judgement in face of pressure, adversity, and challenges. Where was Bernie when Hillary was busy making bad decisions? For over 30 years, Senator Bernie Sanders has fought against the despicable game of pay-to-play politics that defines Washington where lawmakers sell access and influence to the highest bidder. The same pay-to-play game that Hillary mastered in order to transform her life of public service into a multi-million dollar fortune. Bernie led the fight against NAFTA and the TPP because they hurt American workers and would kill American jobs by encouraging multi-national corporations to outsource jobs and production. Bernie led the opposition to the Iraq War citing insufficient evidence of weapons of mass destruction, the unintended consequences of destabilizing the Middle East, and the astronomical cost of war - both in terms of blood and treasure.And in 2008, after Wall Street lost big on series of bad bets, Bernie led the fight against a Wall Street bailout that used tax payer dollars to float the big banks and even fund golden parachutes for morally bankrupt CEOs -- some to the tune of 18 million dollars. But let's rewind the clock even further. What was Bernie doing in the 1960's? The same time that Hillary was campaigning for Republican Barry Goldwater? In 1962, Bernie was arrested for protesting segregation in Chicago public schools. The next year, he joined Martin Luther King Jr. and millions of American's in the March on Washington. We might excuse Hillary for a youthful indiscretion (If ever there was a position she should have walked away from this was it) but incredibly in 1996, in an interview with NPR, Hillary reaffirmed that ""I am very proud that I was a Goldwater girl."" We cannot afford to elect a president with a history bad judgement, inconsistent positions, and who has used public service as a vehicle for private gain. In other words, we cannot afford the status-quo. The only candidate -- and I emphasize only -- that meets the criteria of honesty, consistency, and good judgement is Sen. Bernie Sanders. That's why I support Bernie for president."

He enjoys the same populist tailwinds fueling the more successful, and equally unprecedented, Republican campaign of Donald J. Trump. His voters are just as angry at Establishment politics, donors, and economics. Though Sanders' voters don't seem as bothered as Trump's by the broken borders that contribute to depressed wages, higher unemployment, and rampant inflows of drugs and human trafficking, they are, nevertheless, equally tired of the global trade deals that benefit multinational corporations at the expense of American workers. Rust Belt union members, in particular, have been economically decimated by the globalization bonanza launched by Mrs. Clinton's husband - and backed by Mrs. Clinton, who called the TPP (the Trans-Pacific Partnership) the ""gold standard in trade agreements"" - while Mr. Sanders has long stormed the barricades against NAFTA (the North American Free Trade Agreement), TPP, and other free trade deals. As a result, Sanders could defeat Mrs. Clinton by carrying the Rust Belt, which stretches from Michigan (which he recently won March 8 in a major upset) to March 15th contests in Ohio, Illinois and Missouri, to later votes in Wisconsin, Indiana, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and even Kentucky. He could also expand his populist economic appeal to liberal working class voters in states like Washington, Oregon, Montana, Wyoming, New Mexico, Arizona, South and North Dakota, and the crown jewel of liberal politics, California. All of these states are there for Sanders' snatching, even with Mrs. Clinton's solid support among older blacks and Hispanics. However, for reasons that seem perversely self-defeating in an election year that is known for unfiltered candor, Mr. Sanders has held his fire. And for what reason? The former Secretary of State is not the fearsome Lady Macbeth of Republican stereotype. Barack Obama proved that conclusively. The often shrill, impersonal Mrs. Clinton has no Eva-Peron-like hold on the Democratic electorate, and no ability to engineer George-Wallace-like shenanigans to suppress voter turnout. Sanders has no worries of Clinton payback, nor should he be playing it safe in order to secure a VP slot, where he, like white working class hero Joe Biden before him, will be sent out to pasture: defanged, caricatured and emasculated. Instead, Bernie has a real chance to make Mrs. Clinton yearn to be his VP. To get there, however, he has to stop pulling punches and go for the knockout blow. Wednesday night in the Univision debate, moderator Jorge Ramos - an otherwise shameful and unruly apologist for open borders and the horrors they engender - pointedly asked Mrs. Clinton, ""If you get indicted, will you drop out?"" These Univision moderators were not messing around. So, why is Bernie messing around? Why did he not ask Mrs. Clinton that very question? Why is he giving the Secretary a pass on an issue that is not simply a matter of ""overclassification,"" as Mrs. Clinton wants us to believe. There are thousands of bureaucrats working in the State and Defense Departments right now (I've heard from a few off the record) who contend that they would be fired and prosecuted had they engaged in the same malfeasance and incompetence as Mrs. Clinton and her staff displayed in the handling of her sensitive digital communiqués. In particular, there is growing belief that Clinton violated the Intelligence Identities Protection Act (which doomed Scooter Libby). This 1982 law makes it a crime to deliberately or inadvertently reveal the true identity of any covert operative serving U.S. intelligence if that person has not previously been publicly acknowledged to be working for our spy agencies. Why is Bernie not making this point? Below is the rejoinder that Sanders could and should give if he wants to wrestle the tenuous hold that the untrustworthy Mrs. Clinton has on the plurality of Democratic voters. With no more debates on the schedule, he needs to make these arguments at campaign rallies and in TV and radio interviews from now through June. First, Sanders needs to break with DNC groupthink, and make a stink about Mrs. Clinton's lies after the September 11, 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. As revealed in the last House Select Committee on Benghazi hearing, Mrs. Clinton emailed the truth about what happened at the Benghazi Consulate to the Libyan president and to her daughter Chelsea on the night of the attacks and to the Egyptian president the next day (it was, in fact, ""a planned attack"" by ""an Al-Qaida-like group"" that ""had nothing to do with the film""), and then subsequently lied to the families of the Benghazi victims (saying it was a protest about an anti-Muslim You Tube video clip). Sanders has made no noise about this. Why? Bernie needs to link Mrs. Clinton's fully documented lies on Benghazi to her recent lies about him (e.g., accusing Senator Sanders of opposing the auto bailout, which is patently false, and then linking him to border militia ""known as Minutemen,"" which is patently absurd). There is with Mrs. Clinton a grotesque and recurring habit of bold-faced chicanery and deception. Sanders could effectively end her campaign by exposing it. Why won't he do it? Has someone gotten through to him? Does he think playing nice is a way to defeat her? Has he gone batty in his dotage?Secondly, Sanders needs to get personal, by linking Mrs. Clinton's wealthy donor contributions to the lavish lifestyle that she and Mr. Clinton enjoy in bucolic Chappaqua, in New York's upper crust Westchester County. He needs to paint Mrs. Clinton as the radical chic poster pol that she clearly is. A candidate who will tilt far left during an election to capture populist thunder, but who has no real intention of deeply upsetting her status quo corporate backers. There is no better evidence of this than Federal Election Commission data, which reveals that tens of millions of dollars have been donated to Mrs. Clinton's campaign by some of the world's wealthiest hedge fund titans. Sanders needs to stop focusing on the content of Mrs. Clinton's speeches at Wall Street investment bank Goldman Sachs - though his debate performance spiel on that head always generates applause - but, rather, note that Mrs. Clinton could have read from Das Kapital for an hour and still been paid the same fee. The point is that it was a wink-wink quid pro quo arrangement. He is on point when he says that it stretches the bounds of credulity that Goldman paid Mrs. Clinton $650,000 in speaking fees out of the goodness of their hearts. They wanted something in return. The bigger the give, the bigger the get. Then Sanders lets up, and fails to close the deal. He needs to extend from Mrs. Cliinton's ""market-rate"" (read: exhorbitant) speaking fees to her husband's equally sizable speaking fees as head of the Clinton Foundation. And then Sanders needs to wrap it all up with a nice tidy bow, showing how the speaking fees of the Clintons and the sizable donations made to the Clinton Foundation ultimately affected Mrs. Clinton's policy decisions as Secretary of State. There is a mine field of possible transgressions here, but Sanders lays off. Why? Either there is nothing in all this but insinuation or Team Sanders needs to work much harder to connect the corruption dots. For instance, Sanders could dig deeper into the Dodd-Frank Act Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and other legislation of interest to Wall Street to discover subtle policy compromises Mrs. Clinton might have made. Lobbyists and donors pay not only for political access, but also for tiny changes in legislative bills that go right over the heads of most voters and under the radar of most watchdogs, but have profound effects on the corporate bottom line. What were those compromises that Mrs. Clinton tacitly supported not just for Wall Street financial firms, but also for those firms' top clients? If you know anything about the Wall-Street-to-DC power nexus, you know that those conversations occur, however obliquely, all the time. Huge lobbyist salaries depend on those conversations occurring. Mrs. Clinton backed the $700 billion Wall Street bank bailout known as TARP (the infamous Troubled Asset Relief Program). You cannot tell me she is immune to Wall Street's influence. If she were not so influenced, as she laughably proclaims, why would she vociferously declaim her belief in campaign finance reform, as well as her opposition to Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission? Something does not square here, but Sanders refuses to exploit the contradiction. Right now, Mr. Sanders best line of argument is that Mrs. Clinton is bought by the wealthy, connected donor class, while Sanders himself only takes money from small donors. Deeply reviled, if deliberately misunderstood, liberal media bogeyman, Donald J. Trump, one of Mrs. Clinton's previous donors, has openly copped to the pattern of corruption that the Vermont Senator excoriates. Mr. Sanders should use Mr. Trump's own words to implicate Mrs. Clinton as an active player of the game. Possible question by Bernie: ""What did Mr. Trump get in return for his support of your campaigns, Mrs. Clinton?"" However, just as germane, ""What did you not do that you could have done vis-à-vis Trump, George Soros, Goldman Sachs and your other wealthy backers and all those who contributed generously to your husband's foundation?"" After all, sizable donations are not always made for blatant acts of legal skullduggery, but also as political hush money. Just as magazines do not gleefully launch investigative journalism stories on their largest advertisers, so officeholders do not wage war on their biggest backers. In Mrs. Clinton's case, such corruption might have involved enacting window dressing reform in the form of Dodd-Frank Act, but not actually sending any bankers to jail. As one lobbyist told the Boston Globe in summing up Mrs. Clinton's attitudes towards Wall Street: ""not helpful, but also not harmful."" It's that ""not harmful"" part that Mr. Sanders needs to sink his dentures into. That said, it is no longer sufficient for Mr. Sanders to ""insinuate"" corruption. He has to prove it. Until he does, he will fail to deliver the knockout blow his supporters crave and he desperately needs if he is to overcome Mrs. Clinton's fundamentally corrupt advantage with Democratic superdelegates (read: party insiders).James Marshall Crotty is the peripatetic publisher of Monk: The Mobile Magazine, author of How to Talk American (Houghton Mifflin), and director of the urban debate documentary Crotty's Kids.

The candidates came from three political camps - reformist, hardliners (including the principalists), the moderates, and some independents.Nevertheless, there was one crucial issue missing from the political campaigns; Iran's intervention in the Syrian civil war which has contributed in millions of refuges and a death toll of over 450,000. The public did not appear to question Iran's role in Syria either.Iran in SyriaIran's engagement in the Syrian civil war should have been a crucial issue in the election campaigns for several reasons. First of all, Shiite Iran is hemorrhaging billions of dollars on the Alawite state to keep Bashar Al-Assad in power.The Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) and its elite branch the Quds Force, which operates in foreign countries, have increased the number of Iranian troops in Syria in order to dominate the political, military and security apparatuses of the Syrian government. The number has grown substantially in the last few months since Russia's military joined the Iranian forces in support of Assad.The public funerals of Iranian soldiers killed in Syria are increasing all over the country. Iran is now investing on deploying new special operations from the Saberin commandos of the IRGC Ground Force.IIRGC senior cadres have also turned to training, financing, and creating other Shiite militia groups in the region including ""Katayeb Hezbollah"", ""Imam Ali Battalions"", ""Al-Nojaba Movement"", the ""Badr Corps"", ""Asaeb Ahl al-Haq"", ""Abolfazl Brigade"", ""Khorassani Brigades"", and Hezbollah, to name a few.The red linesThe fact that no Iranian politician has criticized Iran's military, financial, intelligence and advisory involvement in the Syrian civil war suggests that there exist no differences among the factions of various Iranian political camps on Syria.In addition, Syria is the red line that reformist, moderates, or independents do not dare to cross. Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has repeatedly made it clear that the Islamic Republic will not abandon the Alawite state. Recently, He described Iran's role in Syria as the fight between Islam and Kufr (disbelief).""The door for martyrdom, which was closed by the end of the Iranian-Iraqi war, is now open in Syria... Youth have persistently called for going to the battlefield in Syria, where Islam is fighting kufr as was the case during the Iranian-Iraqi war.""It follows that any political candidate daring to question Iran's involvement in Syria will be indeed standing against Mr. Khamenei who enjoys the final say in Iran's foreign policy. This will basically trigger the end of that political candidate's career since the office of the supreme leader has major control over the political process.In addition, IRGC leaders have already consolidated their power in Syria making it clear that there exists no change of plans for Syria. Anyone who opposes their agenda will run the risk of standing against this military empire and powerful hard line organization which wields significant influence in other decisive hard line institutions such as the Judiciary, the Ministry of Intelligence (etela'at), the office of the supreme leader, and the Guardian Council.Furthermore, Iranian leaders and state-controlled media outlets have created a powerful narrative for Syria, aiming to impose fear in the public. Their argument is that if the Islamic Republic does not support the Syrian government, radical Islamist Sunni groups such as ISIS and Jubhat Al-Nusra will take control over the region, endangering the lives of Shiite communities and Iranians both at home and abroad. Hence, any candidate who opposes Iran's engagement in Syria would be aligning himself or herself on the side of ISIS and terrorist groups.Finally, Iranian politicians across the political spectrum do share the same nationalistic and ethnic objectives when it comes to Iran's hegemonic ambitions and pursuit of regional pre-eminence and supremacy. From their perspective, abandoning the Alawite government will result in empowerment of Sunni in Syria which will tip the balance of power in favor of Arab states and against Iran.The unison among Iran's reformists, hardliners, principalists, moderates, and independent politicians will continue to last due to the above factors and their shared convergence of interests in keeping Assad in power. --Dr. Majid Rafizadeh is an American political scientist, business advisor and the president of the International American Council on the Middle East.

12,ARTS,Nuns on the Pun: An Interview with Disaster!'s Jennifer Simard,"Bess Rowen, ContributorPh.D Candidate of Theatre at The Graduate Center, CUNY",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nuns-on-the-pun-an-interv_b_9447728.html,,2016-03-12,2016-03-12-1457825565-5910079-Disaster_Bway_IMG_1636_horiz.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-03-12-1457825565-5910079-Disaster_Bway_IMG_1636_horiz-thumb.jpg," Jennifer Simard as Sister Mary Downy in Disaster!. Photo by: Jeremy Daniel Photography.On an evening back in 2013, I sat down with my best friend to see a show at St. Luke's Theatre called Disaster!. I had no knowledge of the show beforehand - I had not gotten the tickets and when I'm not reviewing I often like to remain purposefully in the dark if I'm not familiar with a play, as it's somewhat rare that I get to be totally surprised. I walked out of the theatre that night after having laughed so hard I cried. I was particularly blown away by the character of Sister Mary Downy, a nun with a powerhouse voice and brilliant comic timing, played by Jennifer Simard. So it is that I responded immediately when I saw that Disaster!  was making the transfer to Broadway. I couldn't wait to see the show again, especially with the impressive cast of musical theatre veterans that populated the Broadway cast. As excited as I was to see Roger Bart and Adam Pascal back on stage, I was equally thrilled to see that Simard and Seth Rudetsky, who co-wrote the show with Jack Plotnick, would reprise their roles from 2013. It is therefore a very big honor for me to have had the opportunity to talk to Simard about Disaster! and her experience on Broadway. A trip to the historic Palace Theatre with her parents and brothers in Manchester, New Hampshire marked the moment Simard knew she wanted to be on stage. After cutting her teeth in New England and working her way up in New York City's theatre scene, this talented character actress now finds herself originating a Broadway role for the first time. A few days ago, I got to ask Simard about her current role and what led up to it.Bess Rowen: You were a standout back in 2013 when Disaster! was at St. Luke's and now you're stealing the show on Broadway; is Mary Downy as fun to play as she is to watch?Jennifer Simard: Oh, absolutely. I think it's a good fit, ultimately, for what I do. You know, she has a lot of darkness in her, and my favorite thing about her - and people in general - are the things we find least lovable about ourselves, the dark, nougatey, gooey center. And Mary Downy is one of those people that I think you come across in life and you look at them and say, ""wow, what happened to them?"" Because she does have some sort of undiagnosed social disorder, a personality disorder, and it's really fun to find those colors every night; and I keep finding things. I am so lucky to work with such experts on stage, because they've actually informed her even more than I imagined, they've helped find new things about her. So it's definitely a team effort.BR: That's so great. I was going to ask you actually, the show just looks like so much fun to do. I was wondering if you have any particular stories about working with this team - whether that be what you just said, expanding on if there's some sort of new aspect of the character you've found out about, or if there are just hijinks happening during rehearsal or some fun story?JS: Oh, how funny. Well, as far as hijinks go...I might ask my cast, like a yearbook, ""who's most this?"" ""who's most that?"" and as far as who's the funniest, I think most of us would agree that Roger Bart has us in stitches. Backstage and on stage. But backstage, I look forward to seeing Roger every day, because he makes me laugh every single day. And I think Adam Pascal said that as well. He just keeps us rolling, and it's good for morale, because he's just funny, he's just innately funny! So as far as hijinks, I can't think of any specifics off of the top of my head...although I've been doing a vlog for broadway.com and I did a whole episode about what are our most irrational fears. And Roger has a fear of balloons...because of the surprising popping noises that they an make. And one day I was about to throw away my balloons that I had gotten from the ladies ensemble and I thought, ""oh, wait a minute! I'm going to prank Roger, I'm going to tie them to his chair!"" And he was a great sport about it. So, we honestly do have a lot of fun backstage. This cast loves each other; there's no drama, we're just a really happy bunch.BR: It's really clear too. That's very immediately obvious on stage. I mean the show is very funny as written, but also you have a really great cast at the moment, but that makes it even more fun. [Reference to a particularly brilliant aspect of Bart's performance that I would like to keep a surprise.]JS: Oh, yeah, absolutely! You know, I have to say that I think Roger has one of the toughest jobs of the show, because it's very difficult to make a villain lovable. And gosh darn it, he succeeds!BR: He does, yeah, totally! I'm really glad you all like each other. That makes me like the show even more. JS: Oh yes! You know, everyone has their main scene partners. [...] I do most of my scene work with Faith Prince - the wonderful, the incredible, the genius that is Faith Prince - and the amazingly talented, star, diva, Broadway debut, Lacretta Nicole. And I am so lucky to have them, they make me better every day.BR: You've sort of already touched on this, but what's your favorite thing about this part? Is it being able to play that balance of that darkness and the comedy?JS: My favorite part...yes, I think you just hit the nail on the head. It's that, and it's the fact that I get to sing the way I love to sing, but because of, I think, because of the way I look, I never get the opportunity to. I never get to sing high, scream, belt rock 'n' roll. I love, love, love my Led Zepplin and my Aerosmith, and little old 5' 2"" me gets to release my inner Steven Tyler! You know, I don't picture many opportunities in my life to feel like a rock star, so I get to sing that way. So that is an absolute joy for me. Just because of my type, I don't get the chances very much. So that's another guilty pleasure.BR: Well it's a joy to watch. No guilt involved, no guilt involved.JS: Okay, okay. I'm Catholic, that's a very tall order, but I'll try.BR: [...] This isn't the first time you've gotten to play a singing nun on Broadway. You were saying about your particular type, so what do you think it is that keeps bringing you to the singing sisters?JS: Well, it's funny you should say that. Back in New England, I did Nunsense, back in Boston in the early '90s. In fact, I was doing Nunsense right when I auditioned for Forbidden Broadway, which is the show that brought me to New York City. So I was playing Sister Mary Amnesia in that show, which was just a joy every day, at the Theatre Lobby in the North End in Boston. And I did it in New Hampshire prior to that. Then, of course, I was honored to be in the ensemble of Sister Act. And in that show you wouldn't have heard me as much, because I was, you know, singing, as you do, blending, in a group, but I got to sing high in that show. But I think, a couple things. One, you know, I was raised Catholic and I know my way around nuns! But I think, more than that, I think it's a good fit for my type, my face, who I am. My friend Madeleine Doherty and I used to joke that if you need a nun, a nurse, a maid, or a fishmonger, we're your gals, give us a call! You know, or a whore. There are just certain archetypes that you always need from a character actress's point of view. You know, it's a stock character, so that's probably why. BR: [...] What do you want people to know about Disaster!?JS: Oh, that's an excellent question. I'm going to say, in my heart of hearts, what I want them to know, is that I am so deeply proud of Jack Plotnick and Seth Rudetsky. Because these two people had a dream and an idea - and a lot of people have dreams and ideas -these two actually made it happen. They opened their laptops and they started typing. How many times do we all sit there going, ""I have the greatest idea for a cabaret show"" and you never do it. Or, you know, insert the dream item here. These two are entrepreneurs. And they're brave! Do you know how brave you have to be to put something out there knowing that someone could come with the gavel and say, ""no, overruled!"" It's very hard to mount a Broadway show. It's basically a game: let's see how many no's we can get. And these two are just driven and persistent. And that's what I want people to know about Disaster!. Not only is it a great show. I could give you the standard, stock answer about how the show is. I think it speaks for itself. It was a New York Times Critic's Pick, and those two did it. And any sort of success that I have in the show, is because of them, and that's it. And I'll never be able to repay them, and I love them very much. BR: I'm so glad you took that in that direction. [...] It's good to know that that feeling is on all sides. I firmly agree with you, and I'm really glad that people get to hear that in your words, not mine. My last interview question is always: is there anything else you want us to know? About the show, about anything? JS: Great. You know what, I will take that offer. One of the things I loved - you know, I don't make the decisions about how the show's marketed and whatnot - and I was so pleased to see in Playbill, in the list of shows, under Broadway shows, things are listed under ""Musical"" or ""Play"", that my show, Disaster!, is listed as ""Musical Comedy."" And, whoever decided that, I actually got a huge smile on my face, and in the classic good old fashioned, musical comedy world, this is what that is. And I don't know about the rest of you, but comedy, to me, can make you cry. You can have tears running down your face. It's cathartic. And you sometimes, I kid you not, you can have real tears of pain, in a good way - of that release. There's one moment in the show that gets a lot of people, including myself every night. And it's such a surprise. But this show is funny, funny, funny, and I love that it is now in the history books, it's opened on Broadway, and it's a musical comedy, so come and laugh! Because, my God we need to. So that's what I want to say. I was so happy to see it on Playbill. I was like, darn right, musical comedy!Disaster! is currently playing at the Nederlander Theatre. Buy tickets here to see the wonderful Jennifer Simard and the rest of the very talented cast filled with nuns, puns, and sharks, oh my!"

""It doesn't happen to be true: a majority of Muslims do not hate America,"" he said.""There is a problem with radical Islam. That is a real threat to Islam and it is a real threat to America, so we are going to have to work with Muslims.Trump last year called for a ban on Muslims entering the United States. He argues that the U.S. does not understand what's driving radicalization among Muslims, a point he repeated in the comments to Cooper. ""There's something there, there's a tremendous hatred there, we have to get to the bottom of it,"" the real estate mogul said.The businessman was asked if the U.S. was at war with radical Islam or Islam itself. ""It's very hard to separate, because you don't know who is who,"" he replied.These kinds of vague statements deflect attention from what experts say are the root causes of radicalization -- alienation, political oppression and other social issues -- back to the religion that some perpetrators of terror claim to reflect.Rubio's comments on Friday echo his clash with Trump over Islam during the debate.Trump alleged that politicians are not properly dealing with radical Islam because they are too politically correct.""I'm not interested in being politically correct. I'm interested in being correct,"" Rubio said.The young senator has tried to present himself as the candidate best prepared to handle U.S. foreign policy. He's attracted support from scores of international affairs veterans on the right.But critics note that he has few accomplishments to point to and that his pushback against Islamophobia has been focused on tactical value -- talking about the benefits of respecting Muslims -- rather than the moral imperative to fight prejudice.Once the darling of Republicans seeking to prevent Trump's near-inevitable grabbing of the nomination, Rubio has seen his star fade in recent days. Rumors have begun swirling about his campaign shutting down. The primary in Florida, his home state, has now become the biggest test for his candidacy. As of Thursday, before the debate, HuffPost Pollster's polling average had Rubio almost 15 points behind Trump."
14,POLITICS,Texas' Strict Voter ID Law Will Get One Last Showdown Before The Election,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-voter-id-law_us_56e1a7d3e4b0860f99d81111,An appeals court will decide whether the law gets to stay on the books for the presidential election.,2016-03-11,"If Texas gets its way, it may get to enforce its restrictive voter ID law at the presidential election in November.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Texas managed to convince the most conservative appeals court in the country to wipe out an August ruling that held that the state's restrictive voter ID law violated the Voting Rights Act of 1965.In an order issued Wednesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit announced that all the judges in active service on the court -- 15 in all -- agreed to reconsider the case all over again.The earlier ruling by a three-judge panel of the same court had found that Texas' controversial S.B.14 law had a racially ""discriminatory effect"" on minority voters -- a victory for voting rights advocates who were hoping to infuse new life into the Voting Rights Act after the Supreme Court effectively crippled it in 2013. With Wednesday's action, that ruling is no more. The 5th Circuit has notified Texas and the parties challenging the law that oral arguments in the case are expected in May.Following that hearing, a ruling could come before the presidential election, though both parties would likely seek Supreme Court intervention if a decision comes down too close to when people actually start casting ballots. Ken Paxton, Texas' attorney general, said in a statement that the 5th Circuit's move on Wednesday represents ""a strong step forward in our efforts to defend the state's Voter ID laws.""""Safeguarding the integrity of our elections is a primary function of state government and is essential to preserving our democratic process,"" he added.Legal efforts to stop S.B.14 have had a long and tortuous history. But this latest sprint is the most ambitious, since it seeks to show that states that were previously subject to federal oversight under the Voting Rights Act -- a requirement the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional -- are still enacting measures to disenfranchise voters.In October 2014, a federal judge conducted a nine-day trial and ultimately threw the book at Texas -- finding that its voter ID law imposed an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote, that it amounted to a poll tax, and that it was passed with a discriminatory purpose and effect.But Texas has fought hard to appeal that ruling, winning a number of emergency reprieves to prevent it from stopping the law dead in its tracks. A few days after the October ruling, even the Supreme Court had to step in -- effectively allowing the law to take effect for the 2014 election.Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wasn't too pleased at the time.""The greatest threat to public confidence in elections in this case is the prospect of enforcing a purposefully discriminatory law, one that likely imposes an unconstitutional poll tax and risks denying the right to vote to hundreds of thousands of eligible voters,"" she wrote in a dissent joined by Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.Stories of disenfranchisement in Texas aligned with Ginsburg's warning. With one more round to go before the 5th Circuit, this new showdown for the voter ID law may very well be its last."
15,HEALTHY LIVING,Arianna Huffington And Evan Williams Get Real About Information Overload,Anna Almendrala,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/arianna-huffington-evan-williams-information-overload_us_56e1fba4e4b065e2e3d569e8,They had to learn these lessons the hard way.,2016-03-11,"Evan Williams, Arianna Huffington and Dave Pell on stage at the 2016 Near Future Summit.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e30830150000ad000b1be3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SAN DIEGO -- Americans are struggling with information overload and the hidden costs of being perpetually “plugged in.” And there’s perhaps no one who feels this most acutely than the people who helped create the current tech and media ecosystem.Dave Pell, a “news-obsessed” media curator who trawls dozens of sites every morning to deliver the most fascinating news of the day, is one of them. At the inaugural Near Future Summit in La Jolla, California on Wednesday, Pell wondered aloud whether knowing “all this stuff” is worth it compared to the real-life moments he misses out on when he glances at his phone. He shared the stage and a bit of this paradox with The Huffington Post's editor-in-chief Arianna Huffington and Evan Williams, who founded influential and popular publishing platforms like Blogger, Twitter and Medium.""You get a notification on your phone about something that happens in another country,” Pell began. “Is that really worth taking your attention away from your kid or from sleep or from meditation?""Of course, it only takes a moment to glance at your phone when it beeps or buzzes. But all those moments lead up to a day full of distractions, said Huffington, and unless we start setting aside prescribed times to look at our devices and then put them away, the non-stop information barrage is going to prevent people from doing the creative or important work they long to do.""The people who are going to win the near future are the people who can sit undistracted without ... feeling compelled to look at everything that’s coming their way,"" she said.Huffington then directly addressed the approximately 250 attendees and speakers at the invitation-only conference, and asked them to join her creating a new set of norms around healthy media consumption, including setting devices aside during mealtimes, not charging devices in an outlet near the bed and even -- gasp -- turning off devices for a set amount of time every day.""All these people who are here, who are leaders in different areas and have their own followings -- I hope they’re going to be a part of this,"" she said.Williams agreed with Huffington. He compared the bits and bytes of media competing for our time and attention to unhealthy, processed foods. We consume both things, he explained. And like food, there’s some information that’s useful, nourishing and worth knowing -- and some that’s just junk.""We have many multi-billion dollar corporations shooting Cheetos into your bedroom at night, using every technology available to overwhelm you with cheap calories and put them right in front of your face,"" he said. ""And we don't yet have the consciousness to say, ‘Actually, even though my base instinct is to grab that, I know better.'""There's some irony to the creators of The Huffington Post and Twitter are warning people away from constantly-updating feeds and lightweight media “snacks.” Both sites built their reputation on having the fastest, most relevant news updates, and both sites have content that ranges from heavy, serious news to fun, entertaining fare. But it’s a contradiction all three speakers readily acknowledged on stage, and one that many more tech and media leaders already embrace.Huffington, for instance, recalled the time she has spent with friends in Silicon Valley, describing parents who are so protective of their children’s time and development that they shield them from the very products they themselves create. In practice, this means Silicon Valley kids without iPhones and iPads, Huffington said. Instead of electronic devices, they play which chickens and legos in a “completely retro environment.""""Anyone who is part of the creation of this new ecosystem -- they’re very careful not to get high on their own supply,” she said, to crowd laughter. “The know the intention of consuming more and more of people’s lives is not a bug of the [tech] system, it’s a feature.”Huffington’s observations are supported by past media reports of members of Silicon Valley’s “digerati” sending their children to no- or low-tech schools and enforcing strict device-free times and zones for their children. Even Steve Jobs said back in 2010, the year the iPad was announced, that his children hadn’t used one, and that he and his wife limited the amount of technology the children used at home. Williams, who is also part of that low-tech parenting push in Silicon Valley, wondered if checking your phone while playing with your kids would one day be looked upon like smoking around children.So do these tech/media giants know something the rest of us don’t? Yes, because they’ve already learned the hard way that burning out can be a matter of life and death. Huffington cited her oft-told moment of awakening: the day back in 2007 that she collapsed from burnout and sleep deprivation, an experience she details in her new book The Sleep Revolution. She hit her head, broke her cheekbone and eventually needed stitches to close the gash above her right eye. Huffington said she was grateful for the injury, because without it she would probably be dead.""In a sense I’m grateful for that, because I would probably be dead, the way I was living my life,"" she said. ""It forced me to look around and see the amount of burnout in our culture.""CORRECTION: A previous version of this story stated Arianna Huffington broke her cheekbone in 2008. It was 2007, and we regret the error. "
16,POLITICS,Elizabeth Warren Says The GOP Has Only Itself To Blame For Donald Trump,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elizabeth-warren-donald-trump_us_56e233b6e4b0b25c91817412,"""They are paying the price for their own extremism.""",2016-03-11,Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) explained to MSNBC's Rachel Maddow how the GOP's history of obstruction contributed to Donald Trump's popularity.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e234491500002a000b1a50.jpeg?cache=zIfpAXkbJE&ops=crop_15_0_3985_1836%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) linked the Republican Party's obstruction throughout President Barack Obama's tenure to the rise of Donald Trump, arguing the GOP has only itself to blame for the state of the presidential race.In an interview Thursday with MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, Warren said the popularity of Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is simply a byproduct of seven years of a Republican Party that refused to treat Obama's presidency as legitimate.""These are both people who basically deny the legitimacy of their opponents, they go on the attack, they demean millions of Americans,"" she said. ""That's what identifies them as extremists.""But according to Warren, that brand of extremism is nothing new within the Republican Party.""What have Republicans in the Senate been doing since the very day Barack Obama was sworn in?"" Warren said. ""They have given into their extremists. In fact, they have nursed their extremists along, so that there have been fights and delays over the basic things that happen in government.""Warren pointed to various instances of Senate Republicans freezing out Obama nominees across government, from agencies to embassies to courts. ""It's not about a problem with a particular nominee,"" she continued. ""What they were trying to do is effectively deny the legitimacy of this president, try to shut down the government, try to keep it from functioning.""And now, with Republicans refusing to even consider an Obama nominee to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court, the obstruction is even more blatantly political. ""That's what constitutes extremism in the United States Senate,"" she said of the Supreme Court controversy. ""That's what has nursed what's going on now in the presidential primaries."" ""They are paying the price for their own extremism. It has now taken them by the throat,"" she continued. ""Guys, this is what you did to yourselves.""Earlier this week, Warren tore into Republicans for obstructing a potential Supreme Court nominee and accused the party of giving in to extremists.""If you want to stop extremism in your party, you can start by showing the American people that you respect the president of the United States and the Constitution enough to do your job,"" she said.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
17,POLITICS,Will The U.S. Ever Get Rid Of Its Lead Pipes?,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lead-pipes-flint_us_56e305d0e4b065e2e3d5ce24,Not many in government seem committed to the idea.,2016-03-11,What happened to Flint's lead pipes could happen anywhere.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_227_5184_2380%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Even after the water crisis in Flint, Michigan, reminded Americans that millions of homes across the country receive drinking water from dangerous lead pipes, there hasn't been much effort to dig up the pipes nationwide. Why?""The reason is they're out of sight, out of mind,"" Sen. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) told The Huffington Post. Listen to a recording of his comments on ""So That Happened,"" the HuffPost Politics podcast. ""People don't know that they're there,"" Cardin continued. ""If people knew there were lead pipes underneath our grounds, if they knew that there's a potential risk to their children they would have demanded action. Unlike roads, which you see every day and you go over potholes, you don't see that with the water infrastructure.""Lead pipes everywhere are old and literally crumbling, with tiny pieces breaking off and flowing to people's kitchen sinks, potentially damaging the brains of small children who drink the water. For people whose homes are connected to water mains via lead service pipes, how much lead they might drink depends largely on how well their local water system treats the water to reduce its corrosiveness.The Flint water crisis occurred because the water system and its state regulator failed to treat the water correctly, which resulted in the corrosion of the pipes and the subsequent lead contamination. It could happen in any city that has lead pipes. Cardin has introduced legislation that would improve monitoring and public notice of lead water problems, as well as provide $60 million annually in grants for lead pipe removal, but wouldn't require public water systems to get rid of their lead pipes. Cardin's proposals, however, aren't about to hit the Senate floor anytime soon. Instead, a bipartisan group of senators has been working on legislation that would use an existing infrastructure loan program that gives cities credits to borrow millions for infrastructure repairs. The bill is designed to help Flint, though theoretically it could benefit any town facing a water crisis.Jennifer Chavez, a staff attorney for Earth Justice, an environmental group, said the Flint legislation is good but that it won't go a long way toward removing America's millions of lead pipes. ""Focusing money on helping Flint is really important at this point -- at the same time, just putting more money into the same systems is not going to fix the problem,"" Chavez said.The Environmental Protection Agency has estimated 10 million properties in the U.S. get water from service lines at least partially composed of lead. It would cost billions of dollars to replace them. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Mich.), one of the top Democrats pushing the Flint legislation, acknowledged it doesn't reach the national scale of the problem. ""I think we have to have that discussion longer term, that we need to continue to be focused on water infrastructure,"" Peters said this week. ""Some of that's beyond the scope of what we're going right now but it's definitely something that will hopefully be part of a broader discussion.""Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.) chairs the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, which oversees water infrastructure. Asked about Cardin's more aggressive proposals, a spokeswoman for Inhofe said the senator's current priority is the Flint bill, which he helped write and which is currently stalled. The top Democrat on the committee, Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), said she was unfamiliar with the specifics of Cardin's proposals but that some of them could be incorporated into a broader piece of legislation the committee will take up later in the spring. ""This is a massive massive problem in our nation,"" Boxer said. ""Flint is the tip of the iceberg and the worst example of lead poisoning from the water."" Public awareness of the Flint water crisis is high -- 58 percent of Americans surveyed by HuffPost/YouGov in February said they'd been following the story -- partly thanks to the Democratic presidential candidates, who used Flint as a talking point in their campaigns and as a backdrop for their debate last week.Lee-Anne Walters, one of the Flint residents who last year helped blow the whistle on the high levels of lead in the city's water, got to ask a question at the debate.""Will you make a personal promise to me right now that, as president, in your first 100 days in office, you will make it a requirement that all public water systems must remove all lead service lines throughout the entire United States, and notification made to ... the citizens that have said service lines,"" Walters said. Neither Clinton nor Sanders promised they would. Clinton said she would ""commit within five years to remove lead from everywhere,"" an answer that Walters said ""actually made me vomit in my mouth"" because of how it sidestepped her specific question about lead service lines.Rather than Congress, water lead experts are watching the EPA's efforts to revise regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act. Even in cases of highly toxic water, the current regulations don't require public water systems to remove the entirety of a lead service line, since the pipe portion underneath a house's front yard technically counts as private property. And public water systems can easily fudge reporting requirements, which Flint did by sampling water from homes that didn't have lead service lines, thereby hiding the problem. Scott Knowles is an associate history professor at Drexel University who has studied political and policy responses to disasters. He said that while the regulatory response takes much longer, any given disaster typically fades from the news within a year. In other words, the political debate at the moment is not necessarily an indication of where policy will go.""Hillary Clinton and Marco Rubio are not going to be the ones who decide what new regulatory reforms will come as a result of the Flint water crisis,"" Knowles said.

18,POLITICS,Marco Rubio Campaign Says His Supporters Should Vote Against Him In Ohio,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marco-rubio-john-kasich-ohio_us_56e2f991e4b0b25c9181bbc0,It's all part of a strategy to keep Donald Trump from winning the nomination.,2016-03-11,Ohio Gov. John Kasich and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) seemed like buddies at a January Republican presidential debate. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The campaign for GOP presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is now actively urging Ohio Republicans not to vote for him in the state's primary next week.Primary voters in Ohio should unite behind the state's governor, John Kasich, if they want to beat overall GOP front-runner Donald Trump, Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said Friday on CNN. His was an out-of-the-ordinary comment in an out-of-the-ordinary race that is leaving many Republicans struggling to come up with a plan to avoid Trump getting the nomination.Attempting to solve the current collective action problem among the non-Trump candidates, the Rubio camp has encouraged Florida Republicans who don't support Trump -- including those who prefer Kasich -- to vote for the senator. Then Rubio supporters in Ohio should vote for Kasich, Conant said.""My answer is John Kasich is the one candidate in Ohio that can beat Donald Trump,"" he explained. ""That's stating the obvious. If you're a Republican primary voter in Ohio and you don't want Donald Trump to be the nominee, John Kasich is your best bet. If you're a Republican primary voter here in Florida and you don't want Donald Trump to be your nominee, Marco Rubio is your best bet. That is indisputable. Everybody would say that.""In Florida, Rubio is ""the only one with a mathematical shot, and if you look at the polls and the early voting, a very good shot, of beating Donald Trump,"" Conant added.Polling indicates that Conant is right on at least part of that equation: Rubio isn't going to win Ohio, and Kasich isn't going to win Florida. Rubio is polling at under 7 percent in Ohio, according to HuffPost Pollster averages, compared to about 35 percent for Kasich, about 30 percent for Trump and about 17 percent for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Trump is leading Rubio by wide margins in Florida, which also holds its primary on March 15. HuffPost Pollster averages indicate support for Trump at nearly 40 percent in the state, while Rubio is in second at about 27 percent. Cruz has support from 17 percent of Florida Republicans, followed by Kasich at about 10 percent. Rubio told reporters at a press conference after Conant's comments that he had not talked to Kasich about the matter, but didn't object to the idea of his supporters voting for the Ohio governor over him. ""If a voter in Ohio is motivated by stopping Donald Trump and comes to the conclusion that John Kasich is the only one to beat him there, then I expect that's the decision they'll make,"" Rubio said. ""I can tell you in Florida, I'm the only one that can beat Donald Trump.""Kasich's campaign dismissed the idea of his supporters voting for Rubio in Florida, according to Associated Press reporter Kathleen Ronayn. Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf said the campaign ""agree[s] with the Rubio campaign that the best chance to beat Donald Trump in Ohio is by voting for John Kasich, and in that spirit, Sen. Rubio should immediately tell his Super PAC to stop attacking the governor."" Rubio has consistently said he will win Florida, skirting questions about whether he will drop out of the race if he doesn't. Rubio, Cruz and Kasich all trail Trump significantly in delegates: Trump has 459, Cruz has 360, Rubio has 152 and Kasich has 54. Both Florida and Ohio are winner-take-all states, meaning the winning candidate in each state receives all its delegates. More than 84,000 Ohio Republicans have already cast absentee ballots in the state. This article has been updated with comment from the Kasich campaign. "
19,POLITICS,A Tranquilized Marco Rubio Makes His Last Stand,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marco-rubio-gop-debate_us_56e2022ce4b065e2e3d56d64,"Out of time and bereft of ideas, the Florida senator takes a dignified bow at a low-energy debate.",2016-03-11,Thursday night's GOP debate may have been Marco Rubio's last chance to prove his worth as a presidential candidate.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56e202631500002a000b1a30.jpeg?cache=qlLglLTjbe&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"So, that happened. In the parallel universe where reality television star Donald Trump never brought his hallucinatory meth-spectacle to the Republican primary, you have to imagine that Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is faring much better. Maybe not in the electoral sense, but almost certainly in the psychic sense. Surely he's not being slowly ground into dust by the daily trials of participating in the ""Trial and Persecution of the GOP Establishment as Directed by Donald Trump and the Inmates of the Stormfront Message Boards.""Alas, that's what's happening to him in our universe, along with thresholds left unmet, delegates left unclaimed and a looming doom in the Florida primary. But with nowhere left to go but Thursday night's debate at the University of Miami, that's where Rubio went. And it would seem that he brought a lot of sedatives with him.  It seems, in this fast-moving festival of schadenfreude and hurt feelings, like it was only mere hours ago that Rubio became the chosen avatar of the anti-Trump establishment, urged to rush into battle with Trump to reclaim the dignity lost by everyone. It hasn't moved the needle. Rubio ended up shut out of last week's primaries. Rather than present himself as a vital member of the anti-Trump squad, he's become the candidate who's in the way of that effort. And with his last hopes hanging on next week's Florida primary, the polling numbers have done just enough twitching, hither and yon, to extend what almost certainly looks like false hope.If anything, Rubio's other compatriots have made the gains he'd hoped to have consolidated by now. Ohio Gov. John Kasich has come through the war of attrition in better standing, and has a better shot at denying Trump a win in his home state than Rubio offers right now. Meanwhile, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz managed to make some delegate gains, and the GOP's Beltway careerists, whom Cruz has spent his entire Senate term alienating, have begun to signal that they might come around. (One wonders what the race is like in the parallel universe where Cruz didn't dedicate himself to being a haughty jackass to his colleagues with quite as much fervor as he has in ours.)Thursday night's debate offered Rubio his last opportunity to play a card he'd not yet played in his quest to prevent the man he's correctly identified as a ""con artist"" from taking his party's presidential nomination. The card he chose to play Thursday? Sedated statesman.It would appear that Rubio really doesn't know what to do anymore, having been urged repeatedly to zig and zag in different stylistic directions over the past month. Thursday, he backed away from calling Trump a fraud. He more or less backed away from fighting with Trump at all.It looked like his ""play"" was to impress his home state voters with gravitas. And it may have struck a contrast, had Trump been up to his typically unruly antics. But, he wasn't. (When your campaign adviser is out on the trail assaulting reporters, it perhaps creates an urgent need for better behavior.)One exchange that exemplified the interplay between Rubio and Trump came about two-thirds of the way into the debate's first hour, as the conversation shifted to Social Security. Trump, who is campaigning on a promise to not touch the entitlement program, was asked how he could make that promise without any sort of reform.""I will do everything within my power not to touch Social Security, to leave it the way it is,"" Trump said, going on to promise ""to make this country rich again; to bring back our jobs; to get rid of deficits; to get rid of waste, fraud and abuse, which is rampant in this country, rampant, totally rampant.""CNN's Dana Bash challenged him immediately on the ""waste, fraud and abuse"" line, noting correctly that eliminating those things isn't enough to close the gap that some are talking about. Trump flailed, giving a rather incoherent answer about how the United States was the ""policeman of the world,"" that gets nothing in return for its overseas military expenditures or military assistance. He then suggested that any future Social Security insolvency problem would be solved by his magical wheeler-dealing skills: ""We are going to be in a different world. We're going to negotiate real deals now, and we're going to bring the wealth back to our country.""The stage was thus set for Rubio to point out that Trump is living up to his ""con-artist"" billing. Instead, Rubio gave a ""low-energy"" answer:BASH: Senator Rubio, will that be enough to save Social Security?And so it came to pass that any Flordians watching at home got to watch their senator gravely pledge to raise the retirement age, while Trump sold them a bill of goods about how he'd reclaim wealth for everyone. Rubio became briefly animated when the conversation turned to Cuba, allowing him to demonstrate that he both cared and knew more about U.S.-Cuba relations than Trump. But once again, his response was not pitched at Trump as an invitation to enter into conflict, and so the moment passed.Of course, it should be pointed out that Rubio was by no means the only candidate who seemed anesthetized during the debate. Tonight was a night where John Kasich's genial low-key chill way of debating made him look positively energetic. One of the night's more torpid moments involved Trump taking a question about violence at his rallies, in which he offered that populist anger made his supporters' violence admissible. His competitors, in turn, just didn't seem to have the energy to object. It was a fine night for authoritarianism all around.For his part, Cruz seemed to be more willing to needle Trump during the proceedings, but his was nevertheless a mannered, debating-society style of argumentation. No one on the stage really sought to match the pyrotechnic heights that have been a feature of previous debates. Trump, pivoting even now in the direction of patching things up with the GOP establishment, was uncharacteristically decorous from pillar to post.And Rubio? Well, he looked for all the world like a man who knew his race was run and done, the only prize left to claim being a small portion of dignity. It's been a strange career for Rubio. As Jonathan Chait pointed out Thursday, the Florida senator has now on two occasions attempted to be his party's young lion. First he tried to assist the Republican National Committee in getting a comprehensive immigration reform bill passed. (He was the Gang of Eight's go-to guy in selling the bill to right-wing talk radio.) Then he tried to defeat Trump. In both cases, he ran headlong into enemy fire at the urging of others, because no one else would. A fat lot of good it did him. Still, perhaps he has a bright future.Elsewhere on this week's podcast, the intensity of the Democratic nomination race got ratcheted up another hundred notches or so after Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) scored a surprise win in the Michigan primary that flummoxed the pollsters, boosted the senator's chances and put the Hillary Clinton's campaign back into arrears. Meanwhile, the Flint water crisis has shone a light on what life is like in poorer cities and the infrastructural problems that need fixing across the nation. But now that the Michigan primary is over and Flint is no longer a campaign talking point, are we poised to forget about our nation's lead pipe problem just as attention is cresting?Finally, the biggest threat to reproductive freedoms in two decades is currently before the Supreme Court, and it comes in the form of some restrictions on abortion providers that have long ventured over the border of absurdity into pure, mountain-grown disingenuousness. We'll explain what's happening and why. Plus, we'll answer the question: Can we still enjoy the NCAA basketball tournament when we know that the NCAA itself is a corrupt and exploitative cartel?""So, That Happened"" is hosted by Jason Linkins, Zach Carter and Arthur Delaney.

Washington Post reporter Ben Terris says he witnessed the event, and was the person to inform Fields that it was Lewandowski who grabbed her and pulled her back. He wrote Thursday that the campaign manager ""yanked [Fields] out of the way"" and described how ""finger-shaped bruises formed on her arm.""On Friday afternoon, C-SPAN video emerged that showed Lewandowski appearing to reach toward Fields.So far, no other witnesses have come forward. Another attendee at the press conference, New York Observer editor Ken Kurson, told The Huffington Post he didn't see Lewandowski assault Fields. ""I was five feet away from the alleged incident and didn't see anything,"" Kurson said. ""I was literally looking right at Corey when it supposedly happened.""The Observer is owned by Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was walking near Trump when the alleged incident took place. Kurson, who is shown wearing a blue V-neck sweater and a backpack in a Vine taken around the time of the alleged incident, said that ""if this happened, I think I would have seen it.""The wild back and forth over the assault allegations comes at a time when Trump's campaign is under heightened criticism for the rowdiness and violence at his rallies and for the severe restrictions placed on reporters trying to cover the protests. A Secret Service agent recently roughed up a Time magazine photographer who left the campaign's designated ""press pen"" to cover demonstrators being ushered out of an event. On Thursday afternoon, the Trump campaign dismissed Fields' allegation that Lewandowski grabbed her as she tried to ask the candidate a question about affirmative action. Lewandowski mocked Fields soon after as an ""attention seeker,"" and Trump suggested the reporter had fabricated her story when asked about the charge following Thursday night's Republican debate. But to believe Fields concocted a story about being grabbed is to ignore several pieces of evidence, including contemporaneous audio between her and Terris. Fields also tweeted a photo of her bruised arm on Thursday in response to the Trump campaign denying her allegations. Jupiter's police department said Friday that it is investigating allegations that a battery occurred on Tuesday at Trump National Golf Club, where the press conference was held. Fields filed a police report on Friday, which the Jupiter Police Department provided to HuffPost. The alleged crime listed on the report is simple battery. What's still missing in the swirl of allegations and pushback is video from a direct angle showing exactly what happened. That has left reporters and members the public analyzing all video clips emerging from Tuesday's event.Many Trump supporters, predisposed to distrusting the media, have seemingly dismissed the allegation -- even though it comes from a reporter who works at a conservative site that has generally been supportive of the Republican front-runner. Fields even mentions to Terris on the audio recording how strange it seems for Lewandowski to be ""going after a Breitbart reporter, the people who are nicest to you.""The Daily Beast reported Wednesday that Lewandowski privately admitted fault to Breitbart reporter Matthew Boyle, explaining that he thought Fields might be a reporter from a mainstream media outlet. Boyle disputed the Daily Beast report Friday and published text messages between him and Lewandowski in which the latter did not admit grabbing Fields. Breitbart's spokesman, Kurt Bardella, told Politico on Friday that he has resigned. ""I reached the point where I couldn’t do 100 percent of my ability to represent them both for them and me, and when you reach that point, it is time to move on,"" he said. Although Breitbart as an institution publicly has stood by Fields, and even called on Lewandowski to apologize, the site published a piece on Friday casting doubt on her story: Joel Pollack suggested that a security official who has a haircut similar to Lewandowski's may have grabbed Fields, based on his analysis of video footage. For this to be true, Terris would have had to have misidentified Lewandowski.Yet it's clear Terris knew who Lewandowski was, and video shows the reporter talking directly to the campaign manager immediately after the incident would have occurred. In addition, Terris was specifically looking for Lewandowski that night. He was on assignment to write a profile of Trump's campaign team and told his own paper Friday that he had his ""eyes trained on Corey Lewandowski."" ""I saw what I saw,"" Terris told the Post. This article has been updated with information about Breitbart's spokesman resigning. "

Donald Trump’s harsh rhetoric is dividing the Republican Party, but still bringing him votes. And polls are probably not systematically biased against Bernie Sanders. This is HuffPollster for Friday, March 11, 2016.MOST PRESIDENTIAL CONTENDERS ARE DEEPLY UNPOPULAR - Chuck Todd, Mark Murray and Carrie Dann: ""Almost a year since the first Democrats and Republicans announced their presidential bid and another eight months until the general election, it's striking how unpopular the remaining candidates are, especially compared with past presidential field. Trump's -39 score -- the lowest in the history of the NBC/WSJ poll for a major presidential candidate -- is a drop of eight points from a month ago; Rubio declined from -3 in February to -11 now; and Clinton's numbers have been stuck in the mud since last summer, when the email controversy became a big story. And it's probably not a coincidence that the two most popular candidates -- Kasich and Sanders -- have faced the fewest attacks during the entire campaign.”‘The low point’ - More from Todd, Murray and Dann: “The only ones who come close to today's negative scores are Bill Clinton (-11) and Bob Dole (-4). 'I've been doing this 1964, which is the Goldwater years,' said NBC/WSJ co-pollster Peter Hart (D). 'To me, this is the low point. I've seen the disgust and the polarization.

That's all there is to it (and you can unsubscribe anytime).TRUMP'S DIVISIVENESS COULD DAMAGE THE GOP - Alan Abramowitz, Ronald Rapoport, and Walter Stone: ""Trump is not only the most unusual frontrunner in recent history, he may also be the most divisive….we asked them to rank 11 potential GOP candidates….Trump was not only ranked first by far more respondents than any other candidate, he was also ranked 11th and last by far more respondents than any other candidate. More than one-fifth of all likely Republican primary voters and more than one-third of those supporting other candidates ranked Trump dead last….Trump is a uniquely divisive candidate within the Republican Party. He receives both intense support and intense opposition from Republican voters. As a result, his nomination would likely present a severe challenge to party unity."" [Center for Politics]REPUBLICAN VOTERS ARE LARGELY FINE WITH ANTI-MUSLIM RHETORIC - Leah Libresco: ""'I think Islam hates us.' That’s the sweeping statement Donald Trump made Wednesday, after CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked him whether the religion is at war with the West….In a survey conducted in January, Pew found that 65 percent of Republicans or those who lean Republican want to hear blunt talk about Islam, even if it includes blanket statements about the faith, while 29 percent prefer that politicians be careful not to criticize the faith as a whole. Only 22 percent of Democrats and those who lean Democratic want politicians to use sweeping statements to criticize Islam, while 70 percent prefer more nuanced approaches…. Republicans were also twice as likely as Democrats to say that most or almost all Muslims in the United States are anti-American (16 percent to 7 percent)."" [538]DO POLLSTERS HAVE A 'BERNIE BLINDSPOT'? - Issie Lapowsky: ""Nearly every time Bernie Sanders wins a primary or caucus, it comes as a surprise to pollsters. In Minnesota,Oklahoma, and Kansas, all states Sanders won, polls had Clinton out ahead by at least a small margin, and in some cases a very large one. Even his virtual tie with Clinton in Iowa was unexpected. But of all the surprises Sanders and his supporters have brought to this cycle, last night’s big Michigan win was by far the biggest….The fact is, these misses are no fluke. Instead, it seems that pollsters across the board have something of a Bernie blind spot. One key reason for that—though not the only reason— is that Sanders supporters are overwhelmingly young, and lots of pollsters still haven’t found a way to reach young voters where they are: their smartphones."" [Wired]Maybe, but it's not consistent - There have been 10 primaries and caucuses so far where 5 or more polls were conducted. Of those, exactly half underestimated Sanders, while the rest actually overstated his margins. The misses in contested states like Michigan and Massachusetts suggest that pollsters might have failed to pick up high youth turnout or last-minute swings toward Sanders. A problem with predicting whether young people will turn out, though, isn't the same as a failure to call enough young people. If likely voter models assume fewer young people will actually vote, it doesn’t matter how many were called. While landline-only polls do present an issue for the industry, there's no sign they're leading to a systematic bias against Sanders -- and in Michigan, surveys that included cell phones also missed the mark in weighting the composition of the state's electorate. ‘SOCIAL DESIRABILITY’ BIAS LEADS PEOPLE TO SAY THEY VOTED WHEN THEY DIDN’T - Ruth Igielnik: ""One-in-six (16 percent) of those who say they 'definitely voted' in the 2014 midterm election have no record of voting in commercially available national voter files, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. So did they vote, or didn’t they? It’s important to know, because this is one of the means by which pollsters gauge the accuracy of their likely-voter predictions for future elections….One likely reason for at least some of this mismatch is the tendency for people to over-report 'good' behaviors, such as voting, giving to charities, or attending religious services, while underreporting unattractive behaviors, such as drug and alcohol abuse. This phenomenon is known as the social desirability bias….Another likely reason for the mismatch, as past research has found, is that the voting record for some people who actually voted is missed by commercial voter files. This happens most often for people who have recently moved. This error may have implications for campaign pollsters who rely on previous voting history in voter files to draw samples of likely voters or to help predict future voting behaviors.” [Pew]FRIDAY'S 'OUTLIERS' - Links to the best of news at the intersection of polling, politics and political data:-PRRI maps out the religious makeup of states voting in the March 15 primaries.

(In the last week, sources have reported that Sony is considering ending the producer's contract.)In the aftermath of Kesha's initial legal loss, celebrities, including Grande, shared their support for the pop star online.Now, Grande is offering her fellow singer more public support.On March 11, 97.1 AMP Radio tweeted about a new interview Carson Daly did with Grande on ""The Daly Download."" During the interview, she mentioned being friends with Kesha and working with the singer when she was younger. She also said she stands by her friend, and highlighted the double standards women experience in the music industry and beyond:I support [Kesha], regardless of what is going on. I didn’t know about a lot of this, you know what I mean? At the time I was really young. We didn’t discuss any of this. The incredible double standards that we [women] face on a daily basis, in the industry and just in the world, it’s shocking. I would be so amused, and pardon me if this comes across as sexist, but I don’t think a male artist would be in the same position right now. Sorry.Listen to a portion of the interview below.In October, Grande wasted no time calling out sexist questions she received during another radio show appearance. While talking with Daly, she noted she has no problem speaking up for what she's ""passionate about,"" especially when it comes to her ""fellow women."" ""My fellow women are definitely something that I will always be one of the first to speak up about,"" Grande said."

John Kasich (R) knows human activity contributes to climate change, but that doesn't mean he's against it. ""I do believe we contribute to climate change,"" he said. ""We want all the sources of energy. We want to dig coal but we want to clean it when we burn it. We believe in natural gas, we believe in nuclear power, and you know what else I believe in? I happen to believe in solar energy, wind energy, efficiency, renewables.""He later clarified that, ""we don't know how much humans actually contribute."" The use of coal and natural gas energy is one of the primary causes of climate change. Burning these fossil fuels releases CO2, which traps heat in our atmosphere and makes the planet warmer. In doing so, humans have managed to help speed up climate change to what may soon be ""dangerous"" levels. And despite Kasich's claim, scientists also have a pretty good idea of just how much we're to blame.""Most of the observed warming since the mid-20th century is due to human-caused greenhouse gas emissions,"" the Environmental Protection Agency says.Still, Kasich's confusing position was overshadowed by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who managed to quote nearly every single climate denying talking point imaginable."
