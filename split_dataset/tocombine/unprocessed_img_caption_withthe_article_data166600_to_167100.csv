But do you look at your dog and feel guilty that you're working out instead of playing with him? How about incorporating your dog into a cardio, calorie-burning workout?",2013-01-11,Description Beagle | Source originally posted to Flickr as http://flickr. com/photos/22215758@N08/2385729492 Sticking out | Date 2007- ... ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb26f2500003300362bb0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's early in the New Year, and no doubt many have vowed to exercise and get into shape. But do you look at your dog and feel guilty that you're working out instead of playing with him? How about incorporating your dog into a cardio, calorie-burning workout? Sure, you could just go running or biking with your dog. Or you could use your workout to work on your dog's down-stay, come when called, and to play fetch. With the help of Igor Seriba, instructor at Hideshi's FitnessGarage, I""ll introduce you to a fun cardio workout, that includes speed and agility for you, that you can do while training and playing with your dog. How Does the Dog Work Into the Exercise Routine? For this set of outdoor exercises, you will simultaneously work on the down-stay exercise for your dog or playing fetch, or alternating between the two. For instance, you can have your dog lying down while you exercise and reward him frequently enough so he stays in a down-stay, or you can play fetch and get as many repetitions in while he's running. In some exercises, you'll even build up distance while your dog is in a down-stay and then practice a come when called. One benefit to incorporating your exercise into your dog's training is that you turn the most boring dog-training exercise ever -- the down-stay -- into a fun routine. Let's face it, having your dog lie down while you stand around and watch the clock to make sure he can stay lying down long enough is more irritating than standing in line to return holiday presents.Practicing a down-stay at a distance is even worse. You have to have your dog lie down, walk away to whatever distance you're practicing (such as 5-30 feet), and then come back and reward him while he's still lying down. You can't just call him to come to you, because then you're rewarding him for a come when called, not a down-stay. Now, if you can exercise during the segments where you'd just be waiting around or if you can exercise on your way out and back from your dog's lying spot, suddenly you're making good use of that time. You'll also be playing fetch with your dog during your rest period between high intensity intervals.What You NeedThis workout is simple. You'll just need your dog's 6-foot leash, a safe area for your dog to play fetch or be off leash, and your dog's treats. I use my dog's daily allotment of kibble for treats. That way his diet is still balanced and he stays trim. The General ApproachThis workout will be high intensity, so you should warm up first and stretch while you work on an easier set of down-stay exercises with your dog. (See: ""Working Out With Your Dog: Quick Outdoor Warm-Up Exercises for You and Your Dog""). For each exercise, you'll start with your dog in a down-stay; make sure you get treats to him frequently enough so he remains lying down. Get the reward to him quickly and low enough so that you don't accidentally lure him to stand. The first exercises are a set of four speed and agility exercise that involve your dog's leash, which will be lying on the ground. You'll perform three sets of five repetitions per exercise with 30, 45, and 60 seconds of rest in between each set. Take the rest time to play fetch with your dog. The final two exercises will be even higher intensity. You'll perform three sets of three repetitions per exercise with 30 seconds of rest during the first break, 60 seconds during the second, and 90 seconds between exercises one and two. Rest sessions are your dog's chance to play fetch. You'll also work a come when called into these exercises.Keeping With ItThat's it: a quick and thorough workout for you and your dog. Practice regularly and not only will you get into better shape, but your dog will be better behaved, too!For indoor exercises, read ""Exercising with Your Dog: A 7 Minute New Year's Exercise Routine for You and Your Dog!""For more by Sophia Yin, click here.For more on pet health, click here.

Through her blog, she is finding ways to grieve and honor the memory of her grandson.",2013-01-11,"This Nov. 13, 2012 photo provided by the family via The Washington Post shows Noah Pozner. The six-year-old was one of the victims in the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in Newtown, Conn. on Dec. 14, 2012. (AP Photo/Family Photo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb52826000036007f9611.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I am still haunted by the events of December 14th at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, CT. None of it seems real, and yet it has entered into the public consciousness in a very raw way. I can't look at my children the same way. I'm much more fearful and less trusting of people. I don't take safety for granted any longer. And yet, everywhere I turn, it is as if people are moving on. While this is surely a coping mechanism, I want to know why our public elementary school has the same false sense of security in place. It is very easy to enter the school unannounced and there is nothing to stop a crazy and deranged person from wreaking havoc. In fact, I recently read about a man allegedly planning to shoot up kindergartners in a Los Angeles school. I am livid.Noah Pozner is the youngest victim of the Sandy Hook Massacre. When you work in social media for a living, you meet many people. Noah's aunt, Victoria, is a fellow blogger and friend. I will never forget her harrowing tweet letting us know that her nephew was unaccounted for. It was terrifying and very personal. As more information became available, my heart broke into a million pieces.Noah's grandmother, known online as ""MC,"" is also a blogger. Before the tragedy, she kept a food blog related to her love of all things bread. In 2009, she introduced herself to her readers: ""I am French... I have been living in the U.S. for over 30 years and... I am passionate about bread, bread making, bread tasting, bread eating, bread blogs, bread books, bread pictures, bread everything."" On December 14, her blog took on a much different tone. She wrote: ""There will be no more bread posts... on this blog for a while. We just learned that our 6-year old grandson Noah has been murdered in the Sandy Hook massacre this morning. Our hearts are bleeding for him, his parents, his twin sister, his other siblings. I have no words left.""Through her blog, she is finding ways to grieve and honor the memory of her grandson. She provides glimpses into his sweet and mischievous spirit through beautiful portraits she took through the years. She mourns the day when she will run out of pictures to post.Just when I feel like giving up on humanity, MC sees the beauty in a new day, and signs of her beloved Noah everywhere she turns. She writes: Were it not for our tremendous loss and pain we might not be assigning any meaning to these occurrences but as it is, we like to read them as tangible signs of Noah's presence and enduring mischievous spirit. If anything they make everybody pause and smile and seeing a smile on the grown-ups' faces clearly comforts the little ones. Since one of the worst aspects of this tragedy beyond the loss of Noah, Noah's deprivation of his entire future and my daughter's bottomless sorrow is to see the little ones grieve, I'd say the more ""signs"" the better. So, please, Noah, my little one, keep at it! We love knowing that you are still with us.Her latest posts affect me the most. MC links to an article in which her daughter described the horrific way her son was killed. I read and I weep. She writes:Twenty mangled little bodies are the price we paid on that day for the freedom to own high-power weapons that can be used in rampage killings. These six- and seven-year olds never had the opportunity to make a decision on gun control, they never got to elect the person who could best represent them in Congress on that issue, they had no say at all. They were born to a culture where violence is omnipresent and revered.Noah did not die in vain. We cannot become complacent after tragedy and stand by and do nothing.There is so much that needs reforming. If children can't be safe in the very place that they are supposed to be the safest, we all need to be held accountable. Something is very broken. MC is sharing her wisdom and pain as a call to action. I will not sit idly by any longer. Who's with me?"

""He is currently in good spirits, is not yet suffering any physical effects and can expect to enjoy at least another few months of reasonable health and activity,"" a statement from Johnson's manager stated, as reported by The Guardian.In 2012, 43,920 people are estimated to have developed pancreatic cancer and 37,390 people are estimated to have died from the disease, according to the National Cancer Institute. Pancreatic cancer is notoriously deadly, with 75 percent of people dying within a year of being diagnosed, MyHealthNewsDaily reported. And within five years, 94 percent of people with the disease will die. Survival rates are higher when the cancer is caught early, but even early-stage pancreatic cancer has a very low five-year survival rate. For the most common kind of pancreatic cancer tumors, called exocrine tumors, the survival rate is 14 percent for the earliest stage (stage 1A) -- it goes down to 7 percent for stage 2A, and 1 percent for stage 4, according to the American Cancer Society. News reports did not specify whether Johnson has the exocrine form of pancreatic cancer. Pancreatic cancer is also not often caught early since symptoms usually don't appear until later on, MyHealthNewsdaily reported. And even when the symptoms do appear, they can be vague (like back pain, or experiencing indigestion). The Mayo Clinic added that pancreatic cancer spreads very quickly, making it hard for surgery to be a treatment option. Surgery can only be used to treat pancreatic cancer if it has not spread outside of the organ, the Mayo Clinic noted. Other treatment options include chemotherapy, targeted drug therapy and radiation. "
3,FOOD & DRINK,Cheap Wine vs. Expensive Wine: Can You Really Tell The Difference?,Kristen Aiken,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cheap-wine-vs-expensive-wine_us_5b9cb623e4b03a1dcc811d51,Don't judge a wine bottle by its label.,2013-01-11,"FAVORITE RED: Trader Joe's Charles Shaw Blend Cabernet Sauvignon (a.k.a.

For the layperson (i.e. anyone who's not a sommelier), drinking wine can be an especially psychologically driven experience, influenced by numerous factors: labels, price points, bottle appearance, and even your peers, just to name a few. But take away all those factors, pour yourself a glass of wine, and take a taste. Without knowing the price or viewing the bottle, can you really tell the difference between a $65 bottle and a $3 bottle? What do your senses really tell you when those external factors and social influences are stripped away? We wanted to find out, so we set up a blind taste test in our office. Here's how it went down:Each taster blindly tried two types of wine side-by-side, not knowing which was which. One was from an expensive bottle, and the other an inexpensive version from the same region. We did this with two reds (Cabernet Sauvignon), and then with two whites (Chardonnay). Testers recorded which wine they thought was the more expensive of the two, and left comments explaining why. Here are the results:THE REDS Cheap Red Trader Joe's Charles Shaw Blend Cabernet Sauvignon (a.k.a. Three-Buck Chuck), California, 2011 -- $3Expensive Red Laurel Glen Cabernet Sauvignon, Sonoma Mountain, California, 2007 -- $65Price difference: $62 Tasters' verdict: Only 38 percent of our tasters correctly identified the more expensive wine, and 62 percent preferred the $3 variety from Trader Joe's. Surprising, right? Think about how much more wine those tasters can get for their buck.THE WHITES Cheap White Glen Ellen Reserve Concannon, 2010 Chardonnay, California -- $5Expensive White Cakebread Cellars Chardonnay, Napa Valley, California -- $45Price difference: $40 Tasters' verdict: 60 percent of our tasters correctly identified Cakebread Cellars as the more expensive wine, but many comments suggested there wasn't much difference between the two (see comments in the slideshow below -- and trust us, you'll want to read the comments).There are two lessons to be learned from this. The first is that wine drinking is a subjective art. The second? Don't judge a wine by its price. (All the more reason to get out there and try some new wines, right?) Check out the tasters' full comments on each wine in the slideshow below.This story appears in Issue 37 of our weekly iPad magazine, Huffington, in the iTunes App store, available Friday, Feb. 21."

(Jeff Swensen/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb5872200003000d9583f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The news that Bill Clinton was chosen as father of the year by The National Father's Day Council has brought for the scoffers. Really, the dude with Monica Lewinsky? The man who humiliated his wife?  They're wrong. A man can be an imperfect husband and still be a great Dad. In fact, it's become something of a national crisis. There are way too many men who love their kids more than their wives when, in truth, a healthy marriage dictates that the relationship between the parents always has to come first.  Countless wives who have come to me for counseling complain that they are married to indifferent, unromantic, selfish husbands. Yet, when I ask them, ""Does he neglect his kids the way he neglects you?,"" the majority of the time they say, ""Actually, no. He's a great Dad."" Even women who have divorced their husbands and told me what miserable marriages they were in will then tell me that, remarkably, their ex continues to be an engaged, and loving Dad.  I'm reading The Patriarch, David Nasaw's magisterial book about Joseph Kennedy. What the biography shows is that Kennedy was a deeply anti-Semitic, compulsively adulterous, misogynist. But boy did he love his kids. A man who put making money before almost all else, the exception was dropping everything whenever his kids were ill. To be sure, there were horror stories like the lobotomy of his daughter Rosemarie. But by and large, though he was an awful, philandering husband who his wife with endless affairs, he was extremely attached to his kids.  Which brings us to Bubba.  A few months ago, while I was sitting at the JCC in Manhattan at a lecture that featured my friend Rabbi Marc Schneier of Westhampton and was moderated by Chelsea Clinton, I was suddenly disturbed by a rush of men with noodles coming out of their ears. Bill Clinton came in and sat in the seat right in front of me. His daughter was on stage and he wanted to see her. He arrived very quietly and was clearly there to show his daughter support. Then, this past Summer, Clinton toured a country very close to my heart, Rwanda, for his Clinton Global Initiative. In so many of the pictures he is walking around with one hand on his daughter's shoulder. Not even his biggest critics deny that he is a loving and involved father who has given his daughter great confidence in herself as a woman, even as he has, most assuredly, caused her pain by acts of unfaithfulness that hurt her mother, all the more so because they were so public.  The two are not incongruous. You can be a great father even if you're not exactly the greatest spouse.  Of course, it's best to try and be both.

5,WELLNESS,Watching TV Can Help You Realize Your Eternal Self,"Bob Lingvall, Contributor
Spiritual Teacher",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/awareness-meditation_us_5b9cb443e4b03a1dcc810ad7,"A meditation practice leading to the understanding of our eternal self as awareness gives us just enough separation from our internal soap-opera production for us to be a little more loving, less fearful and controlling, more aware of the needs, hopes and dreams of another.",2013-01-10,"LAS VEGAS, NV - JANUARY 08: Panasonic Corporation President and CEO Kazuhiro Tsuga unveils Panasonic's new 4K OLED televison during a keynote address at the 2013 International CES at The Venetian on January 8, 2013 in Las Vegas, Nevada. CES, the world's largest annual consumer technology trade show, runs through January 11 and is expected to feature 3,100 exhibitors showing off their latest products and services to about 150,000 attendees. (Photo by David Becker/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb44326000035007f95b9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Can we come to know our eternal self by watching TV? To know your eternal aspect, you want to get to the point where you are conscious of yourself as a point of awareness. Watch yourself in the act of being aware this very moment. Identify with this source of awareness as it uses your senses and your mind. As your identity becomes more and more grounded in being awareness itself, free of any content, you will come to know yourself as a window into eternity, a mirror reflecting the compassion of being. That is our eternal destiny; that is who we are even now. Is it possible TV can be a meditation tool to help us realize this?   You will find a common thread in many meditation instructions telling you not to try to stop your thoughts, but instead to just let them come and go. Most likely, you've heard a version of these instructions before. It's where you are encouraged to develop a state of awareness, often beginning with counting your breaths in and out, then following your breath, and later developing a general state of awareness in the moment. The instructions usually include a comment on how to handle your thoughts. It will be something like, ""Allow the thoughts to come and go. We are not trying to stop them. If you find yourself engaged in one of your thoughts, simply let it go and return to..."" -- here they mention whatever type of meditation you were doing, like following your breath. The reason and wisdom behind these instructions is that they will give you a chance to experience yourself as the one watching the thoughts. The watcher is your eternal aspect. Giving yourself a conscious moment of being aware of being awareness lets you experience the you that continues after you finish this lifetime -- your eternal self. Why not make this task of not becoming engaged in our thoughts easier by watching something really boring on TV? Let's face it, our personal thoughts are engaging, and they are supposed to be. They are about our life. One of my favorite sayings from the recovery movement is, ""I may not be much, but I'm all I think about."" Isn't that the truth. So instead of trying to not engage with your own personal thoughts, start with something easier, like a boring TV show. The next time you are semi-hypnotized in front of the TV, start following a modified version of those common meditation instructions we just looked at: ""Allow the TV show images and sounds to come and go. We are not trying to follow it. If you find yourself engaged in the show, simply let it go and be aware of yourself as awareness."" That's the key -- be aware of your awareness. Awareness: It's you! You are the awareness watching the show. Everything else is content that comes and goes -- whether it is your thoughts, desires, fears, plans, or a boring TV show. You are the awareness experiencing it all. Awareness is the common thread through all your experiences. It is who you are.  It is important to keep this meditation practice -- as you would any practice -- in perspective and balance. The goal of meditation is not to become permanently disengaged from our thoughts and our life. It is not to stay in the state of being conscious of being awareness. Instead, we are here to have a wonderful, full human life, deeply engaged and mindful of all the details of our loves, challenges, dreams, noises, smells, and colors. We practice this meditation in a balanced way to help us enter more fully into the experience of our life and to get out of our heads once in awhile. The meditation practice of knowing yourself as awareness will help us stop identifying 100 percent with the TV show we are all writing and directing inside our head. You know, the one we spend most of our life watching. It is our personal, internal soap-opera experience of life. ""I am this. I am that. I believe this. I like that. I don't want this. I am afraid of that. They did this to me. I'll do that to them."" And on and on it goes -- me, me, me, mine, mine, mine. A meditation practice leading to the understanding of our eternal self as awareness gives us just enough separation from our internal soap-opera production for us to be a little more loving, less fearful and controlling, more aware of the needs, hopes and dreams of another. It allows us to live in a more healthy, happy, loving, productive way -- engaged not obsessed, able to let it go when we have done what we can. I love TV as much as the next person -- both the one inside my head and the one outside. Still, it's good to be able to turn off both TVs sometimes and rest as eternal awareness -- content-free bliss. Perhaps, like me, you were expecting your true self to be so much more than awareness, but our expectations will cause us to miss the truth of who we are. You are the thinker of your thoughts, the seer seeing with your eyes. You are awareness. Are you disappointed? The good news is the very ground of being is blissful love, and as awareness we become whatever we are aware of. Being awareness when the ground of being is blissful love gives you an eternity of knowing, becoming, and being this very love. Awareness becomes what it is aware of. Here is the source of the mystics baffling speech and poetry, mixing up flesh and spirit, mud and perfection, never sure where heaven ends and the earth begins.When, for a moment or two, you are free from self-identifying with any content (personality, body/mind complex, etc.) and you have a brief momentary experience of just being awareness, you will never think of awareness as ordinary ever again. When your awareness is not preoccupied with content (ideas, thoughts, reactions, feelings, etc.) and your self-identification is grounded in being awareness, you are ready for the realization of the compassionate bliss of being itself. As empty awareness, free of any identifying content, you are a window into eternity, a mirror reflecting the compassion of being. That is our eternal destiny. That is who we are even now.For more by Bob Lingvall, click here.For more on meditation, click here."
