1,WEDDINGS,7 Olympic-Inspired Lessons for Married Couples,"Gina Visram, Contributor
Founder, Limitless Coaching",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/7-olympic-inspired-lessons_us_5b9c2445e4b03a1dcc7c968d,"It may come as a surprise, but even an event focused entirely on sporting prowess can provide inspiration to strengthen one of our most important relationships: marriage.",2012-08-14,"United States' Alex Morgan holds her gold medal during a women's soccer availability following the team's gold medal win at the 2012 Summer Olympics, Friday, Aug. 10, 2012, in London. (AP Photo/Ben Curtis)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c24451f00002c00211b76.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Greatest Show on Earth has come to an end. I admit that as a proud Londoner, I may be slightly biased -- but personal bias aside; it seems that London's Olympics have been a resounding worldwide hit. London is now experiencing an Olympic hangover... a post-high cocktail of elation, exhaustion, inspiration and woe. It was seven years ago that London said ""I do"" to hosting the Olympics and for the city's dwellers it's hard to believe that it has come to an end.This, then, is a good juncture to reflect on what lessons we can learn from the Games. It may come as a surprise, but even an event focused entirely on sporting prowess can provide inspiration to strengthen one of our most important relationships: marriage. Here are seven Olympic-inspired marriage lessons for your consideration:1. False Starts are Fatal:Since the last Olympics, the ""false-start"" rule has been incorporated into Athletics. Different to previous Olympic Games, the rule states that a false-start now equals an immediate disqualification. If you start too early, there are no second chances. In marriage terms, this lesson has nothing to do with age, but it can provide food for thought for couples considering tying the knot. It is important to know when you are ready for marriage as a couple. It may be after six months of being together. It may be after six years. Whichever way, you need to approach it with honesty, communication and a clear, agreed understanding of your rules to avoid a potentially fatal false start which you may not recover from.2. Value each other:One of my lasting memories of the Games is the moment Jamaica's Usain Bolt and Great Britain's Mo Farah -- triple and double gold medal-winners from the 2012 event -- stood together holding the other's victory pose. While Farah did the 'To the World/lightning Bolt' and Bolt did the 'Mo-Bot' the image became an image highlighting friendship, humor, respect, determination, excellence, inspiration and equality. For these two men who have known each other for 10 years it was their way of honoring the achievements of the other. For married couples, it can only be a positive thing to value each other. Take the time to laugh together, to set goals and to admire each other (for achievements great and small).3. Don't be afraid of changeThe London 2012 Olympic Games highlighted that change can be a positive thing to be embraced, not something to be feared. It saw the first ever women's boxing events and the first time that there was a female athlete in the team of every country to compete in the Games. Going back a few years, a major change in 1948 was the introduction of the Paralympic Games, an event we look forward to in a few weeks that is expected to be sold out for the first time ever. This was change for good... and for any couple who intends to be together 'till death do us part', embracing change is a necessity. 4. Don't be afraid of PDAs:The London 2012 Olympic Games were not short on public displays of affection. We saw the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge jump into each other's arms to celebrate a victory they witnessed. There were also varying proposals of marriage at events, such as spectator Tom Holt proposing to his girlfriend, Elfi Czinegeova, in front of a crowd of 15,000 at a Beach Volleyball event. Public displays of affection can be a sign of seizing the moment, which is a great attribute for couples to have. If it's good enough for the Olympics... it's good enough for us!  5. Don't give up on your goalsIt seems to me that to be an Olympian, it is essential that you don't give up. Not only do Olympians train for an astounding amount of hours per day or per week, but to be successful, it is essential to recognize that you may not win every battle every time... but if you don't give up, you can still come back and take gold. Athletes that highlighted this during the games included:• Michael Phelps, the world's most decorated Olympian who even after losing his coveted butterfly title, came back days later to resolutely win his individual title. He retired this week with 22 medals (18 of them gold) from three Olympic Games• Mo Farah, the British athlete who had learned an important lesson, one which Albert Einstein himself subscribed to. It seems Farah learned that the definition of insanity is to do the same thing over and over again and expect different results. In his case, he tackled his previous sub-medal standard performance by training in a different way, in a different place, with a different coach. The result? Two shiny gold medals for the 5,000m and 10,000m races that he recognizes would not have happened if he hadn't analysed and acted on what had gone wrong previously• Katherine Grainger, a British three-time silver medallist rower (from the Sydney, Athens and Beijing Games) who finally gained her gold 12 years and four Games on from her original attempt. Perseverance and change, including finding the right partner was key to this success.There are countless other examples of this from athletes who competed from all over the world and the lesson here to married couples is that even when you feel down and out, it can still be worth giving it your best attempt again. Achieving success may involve implementing some changes, but being open to agreeing to try something different and not giving up can yield medals.6. Show your appreciationAt times it can feel like ""Thank You"" are the two most underused words in the English language, and during London 2012, we were reminded that it doesn't take much to show our appreciation for each other, yet it can result in something magical. The organizers profusely thanked the more than 70,000 volunteers involved and the athletes passionately thanked their coaches, their supporters and their fans. Taking the time to say thanks to our greatest supporter, our spouse will be just as appreciated. 7. Be yourself:Anyone who watched the Olympic Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the London 2012 Games will recognize that both Directors didn't hesitate to 'be themselves' -- i.e. to present what they consider Great Britain to be, even if some may not understand or may consider it to be somewhat... [insert your own appropriate word here: weird, wacky, eccentric, etc]!This was not about trying to copy the admirable precision of the ceremonies in Beijing (a task I think we would have failed at miserably). Doing it the British way was the solution to avoiding an unfavorable comparison.And that we did. The Opening ""Isles of Wonder"" and the closing ""A Symphony of British Music"" ceremonies were awesome spectacles to be admired in their different ways -- from the most exciting and interactive history lesson you ever witnessed, to the reunification of the Spice Girls. Even if you didn't like every choice that was made in the shows, you got a sense of confidence, identity and strength in the decisions made regarding these presentations. The Olympic-related lesson for marrieds? You can be proud of yourself if you are true to yourself. As with the opening and closing ceremonies, you can love it or leave it... and in the case of your spouse, I hope 'love' is the option every time.

Divorce, however, is a totally private and personal event. But, is it really?",2012-08-13,Unhappy couple lying in bed facing away from each other after and argument or fight.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c18312200003000d91ca3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Your friend tells you he's getting divorced. You're shocked because he and his wife always seemed like the perfect couple. You're worried for them and their young kids, and their divorce causes you to reflect about a lot of things you've observed about marriage.You know enough from your own parents' divorce how unhappy things can be for the kids, how emotionally and financially hard it can be for one spouse or the other, how even a ""good"" divorce can be fraught with complications once new loves arrive on the scene.Beyond that, they're the third couple in your circle of friends to divorce in the past year. You start to question your own marriage -- are we next? Are we being blind to our own issues, not so different from those of our friends? Are we truly as happy and committed as we say we are, or others believe us to be?You feel somewhat helpless but anxious: What do you do? What should you do? What can you do, if anything? Still, you know that some marriages can't -- and shouldn't -- be salvaged.We wed in a great public display of love and commitment. Divorce, however, is a totally private and personal event. But, is it really?Perhaps not, suggests M. Christian Green, a senior fellow at the Center for the Study of Law and Religion at Emory University and a former lecturer at Harvard Divinity School.Divorce doesn't just affect a couple and their immediate family; friends, neighbors and entire communities are impacted as well, she writes in ""There But for the Grace: The Ethics of Bystanders to Divorce,"" an article in the Institute for American Values' newsletter, ""Propositions.""Green suggests it may be wrong to view divorce as merely a personal choice with limited impacts. In looking at ""the public effects of the divorce revolution, its implications for both the moral formation of individuals and the well-being of society, and what, if anything, organizations of government and civil society should do,"" divorce might be better seen as a decision that has far greater implications, she says. Like other so-called private actions, divorce may have ""wider, sometimes unintended and unanticipated, effects on surrounding communities and the wider society,"" she states.Do others who witness a divorce experience a ""there but for the grace of God go I"" moment? Does this witness produce bystander anxiety? Does it produce something like survivor's guilt? How does witnessing the divorce and family disruption of others affect the bystander's own worldview when it comes to normative images of marriage, family, society and self? Extending the circle of bystanders even further, what effect does the witness of divorce have on society as a whole? Has the divorce culture produced a kind of cultural trauma?It's clear the ""divorce revolution"" is impacting twenty- and thirty-somethings, especially men, many who are delaying or avoiding marriage altogether. Green cites studies that suggest divorce is somewhat contagious, not in a disease sort of way, but in its ripple effect -- one couple's divorce can influence divorce among siblings, friends, neighbors and even co-workers.In addition to ""contagion"" theories, there's the ""generational dimension"" -- adult children of divorce tend to divorce, too.Finally, she says, the breakup of a family may be no different than other trauma, such as war, terrorism, genocide, natural disasters and unemployment, in a child's eyes. Green suggests our current definition of cultural trauma -- although ""controversial and contested"" -- is broad enough to include divorce. A child of divorce may experience the same economic deprivation, relocation, shame, guilt and memories that ""shape moral formation"" as those who have experienced other traumas.Ultimately, she says, all of us are impacted by divorce, even if it's not our own.""(W)hen we bring research on divorce into conversation with rich, emerging bodies of work on social contagion and cultural trauma, we see that bystander effects, while indirect and diffuse, may be no less real or consequential, and that they beckon us to individual and collective reflection on the broader effects of the 'divorce revolution.'""Does that mean we, as bystanders, have a right to ask more of those who may be considering divorce? Should couples think beyond their own needs and desires when they weigh the pros and cons of dissolving their family? Should bystanders have any say in a couple's divorce?It would seem somewhat crazy to tell a friend that his divorce is not only causing you distress, but that it also may put ideas into your spouse's head, which may lead to your own divorce, thus impacting your kid's ""moral formation"" -- and could he please just give counseling one more try? After all, it's none of our business. But, perhaps it is. What do you think?"
5,TRAVEL,Exploring Chicago's Lakefront From Lincoln Park To Grant Park,"Lisa Dworkin, Contributor
President, Best in Beach",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chicagos-lakefront-from-f_us_5b9c17aae4b03a1dcc7c478e,"Enjoy numerous recreational activities, first-rate shopping and untamed nature within the city limits.",2012-08-13,2012-08-07-12028911touristsunderthecloudgateinmillenniumparkchicagoillinoisusalookatreflectionsinthebea.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-08-07-12028911touristsunderthecloudgateinmillenniumparkchicagoillinoisusalookatreflectionsinthebea-thumb.jpg,"Chicago's lakefront stretches from the city's northern to southern boundary lines, but it's the area between Lincoln Park and Grant Park that offers the most to see and do. You will find many of the things Chicago is known for along its lakefront, such as world-class museums, notable architecture and delicious food. You can also enjoy numerous recreational activities, first-rate shopping and untamed nature within the city limits.Lincoln ParkAt over 1200 acres, Lincoln Park is Chicago's biggest park. The park is home to the Lincoln Park Zoo, one of only 3 free zoos in the US. Other places of interest within the park are the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum, Lincoln Park Conservatory, Chicago History Museum, Theater on the Lake, and Lincoln Park Cultural Center.The park also provides many recreational opportunities for Chicagoans and visitors alike. In addition to a section of the paved 18 mile Lakefront Trail, there are a rowing canal, playing fields, fieldhouses, an archery range, playgrounds, and fishing and birding areas.Lincoln Park isn't only a park; it's one of Chicago's 77 distinct neighborhoods. The neighborhood's boundaries don't match the park's, but they overlap between Diversey Parkway and North Avenue along the lakefront. This neighborhood is a nice mix of residential units, restaurants and other entertainment, and is a favorite among young (20s - 30s), single adults. Many of Chicago's most acclaimed restaurants like Alinea and Charlie Trotter's are in Lincoln Park. In my opinion, these world-renowned restaurants pale in comparison to the best burger joint of all time: Weiner Circle. Weiner Circle is a true dive: cash only and open from 10:30 AM to 4:00 AM (5:30 AM on Friday and Saturday). This is THE PLACE to get a greasy, mouthwatering, heart attack inducing charcheddar burger and cheese fries. Keep in mind, most of the time Weiner Circle would get a ""G"" rating, but after midnight the staff can get profane. Don't go then if you are easily offended.If you're a beach lover, North Avenue Beach is the most popular beach in the area. It's also the one with the most amenities. You will find washrooms; showers; a restaurant; a bar; carry out food counters; a boathouse shaped like an actual boat; yoga classes; and bike, kayak, SUP, and Jet Ski rentals there.The Magnificent MileThe Magnificent Mile refers to North Michigan Avenue from Oak Street to the Chicago River. This is where you will find the greatest concentration of upscale shopping and hotels in Chicago. While Michigan Avenue isn't directly on the lake - it's anywhere from 1 block west at Oak Street to 4 blocks west at the Chicago River - you are always within walking distance.Although technically part of Lincoln Park, Oak Street Beach anchors the Magnificent Mile on the north. As Chicago's ""see and be seen"" beach, its character is far more posh Magnificent Mile than mellow, sporty Lincoln Park. Examples of significant architecture abound along the Magnificent Mile. This is where you will find Chicago's Water Tower and Pumping Station, two of the few structures left from before the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. Nearby is the John Hancock Center (1970) -- at one time the tallest building in the world --, which has a viewing deck as well as a restaurant and bar to enjoy the stunning vista. On a clear day you can see across 4 states: Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Other buildings of note include the Fourth Presbyterian Church (1914), Drake Hotel (1920), Wrigley Building (1921), Tribune Tower (1925), and Palmolive Building (1929). Grant ParkGrant Park is where you will find some of Chicago's best, and most well-known, museums. These include the Field Museum of Natural History, John G. Shedd Aquarium, Adler Planetarium, and Art Institute of Chicago. The Field Museum, Shedd Aquarium, and Adler Planetarium are all part of Chicago's Museum Campus while the Art Institute is a few blocks west on Michigan Avenue. Another notable feature of Grant Park is Clarence Buckingham Memorial Fountain. Built in 1927, it's a magnificent work of art where you can see a free water and light show from April to October beginning at 9:00 PM each night. Grant Park figures prominently in Chicago's history. It's one of the places where Chicago Police clashed with demonstrators during the 1968 Democratic Convention. It's where Chicago celebrated the Bulls' championships in the 1990s, and it is where President Barack Obama made his victory speech on November 4, 2008. Grant Park is also where you can attend various concerts and festivals such as Lollapalooza and The Taste of Chicago.Millennium Park is part of Grant Park, making it a park within a park, so to speak. Whereas Grant Park's origins date back to the 1800s, Millennium Park is the brainchild of former Chicago mayor Richard M. Daley. It was formally opened in 2004, and is where you will find Cloud Gate (better known as The Bean), the Frank Gehry designed Jay Pritzker Pavilion, the Crown Fountain, and the Lurie Garden among other interesting buildings, structures, and artwork.Whatever you like to do, Chicago's Lakefront probably has it."
6,DIVORCE,Your Friend Is Getting Divorced: 12 Helpful Things You Can Do,"Penney Berryman, Contributor
Blogger",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/divorce_us_5b9c1743e4b03a1dcc7c43d9,"While no one can remove the pain of divorce, they can ease it. Here are 12 things people did for me that actually helped.",2012-08-13,"Table with porcelain cup and pot, newspaper and bunch of flowers on it",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c174326000036007f5a5f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I started drafting this during my divorce as a response to well-intentioned friends who kept asking what they could do for me. I was at a loss as how to reply (make me not hurt? speed up time? buy me a house far away?) and started jotting down moments when I felt loved or special or smiled -- and the list grew. While no one can remove the pain, they can ease it. Here are 12 things people did that actually helped:1. Sent me flowers at the office -- from the family dog.Not only was this just the cutest idea, but the flowers were perky and colorful. And since they were from a dog, I had a story to tell that didn't involve me talking about the soon-to-be ex-hubby. Looking at them on my desk gave me a smile.2. Included me in family traditions and meals.Even if it was out of pity, I appreciated it. It made me feel wanted and like good company, and forced me to talk to people rather than eating boxes of mac 'n cheese on the floor. These outings often meant I didn't have to cook for one. (Don't underestimate how awful cooking alone becomes compared to the ritual of cooking with someone else). This is one of the best gifts to give someone feeling lonely -- the gift of inclusion.3. Promised to introduce me to any eligible, worthy single men they knew. This was important because I needed the hope. And a reason to wear eyeliner -- and care if I flossed. This led to some very interesting blind dates, as well as some lessons in love and even a few great guy friends. I didn't always say yes to the offers, but I'm thankful for the ones I did.4. Cried with me.Friends cried with me because I was sad. This was so unexpected and unexperienced that I was deeply touched. I remember sobbing in my friend's driveway, then looking and seeing her eyes brimming with tears. Someone cared enough to hurt alongside me -- which made me feel valuable at a time when I felt like utter shit. Kudos to those dear allies who held me, fed me and let me bawl on their couches, beds, floors, driveways, sidewalks, office chairs, shoulders, cars...5. Let me give back to them.It's hard to feel needy and lonely and stuck in a dark cloud all the time. I wanted opportunities to give back to those who welcomed me while I was a mess. I did this by babysitting, making meals, volunteering to help set up parties, running interference at their uncomfortable family gatherings, recommending hair products or salons, listening, cat-sitting -- anything that allowed me to offer a small gesture of gratitude in return for all the support I received.6. Ignored the ""judgment"" button and pushed down the ""human"" button.I may have turned pink when I shared my walk(s) of shame, but the truest friends didn't tsk-tsk or lecture. They asked with a smirk, ""Was it good?"" and ""Is that a new shirt?"" It is my life and I have responsibility for it. Support the sometimes questionable decisions, and also let us vent about the disappointments -- even if you saw them coming. Now is not the time to opine on the scientific validity of psychotherapy when you know we're going three times a week.7. Allowed me to not talk about the divorce.On occasion I wanted to listen to other people's lives to get out of my own head. Sometimes I needed to not talk about the dissolution of my marriage so I could pretend to feel normal and not be solely identified as ""the friend going through a divorce."" Don't worry about complaining about your life, stress, jobs, and amusing moments. I want to hear about your struggles and realize that your life isn't perfect either. Just try not to one-up us on horrible divorce stories.8. Complimented me.One of the lasting pains of divorce is the feeling of utter rejection from someone who vowed to love me for life. Combating the pervasive question of ""What is wrong with me that made them leave?"" is not a simple or quick process. I made lists of nice things people said to me during the day just to focus on positive interactions. Here's to Caribou coffee guy saying my nose stud was cute, the jealous colleague sending me a nice email and to the creepy video man saying my shoes and suit were nice, the old men at the bar saying that I looked like a movie star and the drunk concert hipster who said my hair was awesome. There can never be too many compliments in the world, and since your friend is feeling particularly unloved, your words bolster them. Be the person they add to their list of ""nice moments today.""9. Took care of me when I was weary to the bone.There is so much emotional effort involved in divorce and maintaining sanity. The transition from a twosome to a single is tiring. All the time. And suddenly we don't have a person to make soup or bring us Kleenex or lay our head on, which doubles the misery. When I got sick after drinking too much, a kind boy held my hair, cleaned me up and texted my sis that I was fine. When I was grouchy at work, a girl dragged me to yoga and loaned me an outfit. When I was too tired to leave home, no one made fun of me. When I fell on the ice, a colleague bought me a bar of chocolate. When I called bawling from a restaurant, a darling lady told me to taxi over -- and then fed me buttered toast while I sniffled on her couch, wrapped in a Snuggie. The thing is, your friend is capable and independent and doesn't need a man or a woman to complete them. But sometimes they forget.10. Offered to beat up my ex.I adored this offer. And I loved that it came mostly from boys -- including my dad. Okay, so maybe my dad drafted an entire assassination plan, which I only recently learned about, but the point is this sentiment warmed my heart. It still does.11. Accompanied me to difficult, divorce-related events.The day my soon-to-be ex was moving out, I thought I could handle seeing him and his sister pack up ""his"" pile. When that delusion quickly vanished in a pool of tears I called a friend. We made pizza at her place while I waited for the ""all finished"" text. Then she asked if I wanted her to come inside and see the place together. I would never have thought to ask, but it was exactly what I wanted -- a steady hand to see the condo for the first time stripped bare -- just how my heart felt. I was terrified at what I'd find, and she bolstered my spirits by walking around with me.12. Agreed to hare-brained ideas.Look, I knew you didn't want to go clubbing; you were tired, stressed, had a family/child/pet waiting for you and a mountain of dirty laundry to tackle. Yes, you gave up sake bombs years ago and certainly don't have any flag football skills to speak of. But when I needed to try new activities, I had friends who said yes. They were game! They were willing to step outside their comfort zones to prioritize time with me while I spread my tender, new wings in the social and dating arenas. Say yes when your divorcing friend asks you to try something. At the least, it'll make for an entertaining story.Let your humanity shine: listen, compliment, be thoughtful, respond sincerely to your friend's needs and withhold judgment. And give chocolate, lots and lots of chocolate."
