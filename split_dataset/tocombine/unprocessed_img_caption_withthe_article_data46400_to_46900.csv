0,QUEER VOICES,Jon Voight Likens Donald Trump To Mother Teresa At Values Voter Summit,Michelangelo Signorile,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jon-voight-donald-trump_us_57d3fed2e4b03d2d459ab14c,And evangelical leaders explain why they support Trump,2016-09-11,"“You’re always going to have people picking apart this great man,” actor Jon Voight (right) send of Trump. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d414ca180000e000313ac2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"At the annual Values Voter Summit this weekend, Christian conservative leaders and attendees offered interesting and sometimes bizarre explanations for why they’re supporting the thrice-married, often offensive and insulting Donald Trump in interviews with me for SiriusXM Progress. Outside the conference of evangelical activists at which Trump spoke on Friday, a group of religious leaders opposed to Trump staged a protest, explaining that the Republican nominee didn’t exemplify Christian values when he mocked a reporter with disabilities and called women “pigs.”But former GOP Congresswoman Michele Bachmann, a former Ted Cruz supporter, called the protest “nonsense” and repeated her view that, “God had a hand in the political process” in making Trump the GOP nominee. She also dismissed Trump’s praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying only that, “there isn’t a dime’s worth of similarity between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.”Christian Broadcasting Network host David Brody, responding to Trump’s claims that he will be “better for the gay community” than Hillary Clinton, observed that evangelicals will “look the other way on that” because they “believe Donald Trump will support conservative nominees” for the Supreme Court and they “look at it in those terms and don’t look at it as a man, if you will.”Then there was actor Jon Voight, who said he traveled to the conference in Washington specifically to introduce Trump from the stage. The Academy Award winner, who explained that he’d supported Trump from the beginning of his run, responded to the protest of religious leaders outside of the event by comparing Trump to Saint Mother Teresa and the Nobel laureate and theologian Albert Schweitzer. “Well, I’m a Catholic and I’m speaking to this group of Christians, and I’m happy to be doing it,” Voight said. “There will always be naysayers. There are people who are naysayers against Mother Teresa, trying to find something against her. They did it with Albert Schweitzer, and I was so enamored with what Schweitzer was doing in Africa.”“And,” Voight continued, referring to Trump, “you’re always going to have people picking apart this great man.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar,rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, anti-LGBT rights advocate and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
1,ENTERTAINMENT,"50 Years Of Beatles: 'The Bigger They Are, The Harder They Fall'","Ken Womack, ContributorEverything Fab Four",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/50-years-of-beatles-the-bigger-they-are-the-harder_us_57d5e14ae4b0f831f7072211,"On September 11, 1967, the Beatles undertook a fateful course—one that would humble them profoundly in the coming months",2016-09-11,"John, Paul, George, and Ringo on the set of ""Magical Mystery Tour""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d5e1b1180000f527bd0b46.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On September 11, 1967, the Beatles undertook a fateful course—one that would humble them profoundly in the coming months: with the recent triumph of Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band and the international simulcast performance of “All You Need Is Love” under their belts, they tried their hand, bizarre as it may seem in retrospect, at becoming film directors.John Lennon, for one, recognized the dangerous waters that the Beatles had been trolling in since manager Brian Epstein’s untimely death only a few weeks earlier. As Lennon later remarked, “I knew that we were in trouble then. I didn’t really have any misconceptions about our ability to do anything other than play music. And I was scared.”To Lennon’s credit, he understood intuitively that while their work as composers and their musicianship may have been unparalleled, such skills didn’t necessarily prepare them for making movies. But with Paul McCartney eager to see the Beatles make their mark in those post-Pepper, post-Epstein days, they amiably trudged on.McCartney fashioned the idea for the group’s latest film project on traditional English day trips to the countryside. As McCartney later observed, “In England, they have these things called mystery tours. And you go on them and you pay so much and you don’t know where you’re going.” Clearly, the Beatles adopted this concept literally as their movie’s central aesthetic, essentially making things up as they went along. And with that, the Magical Mystery Tour was born.Renting a 62-seat bus as their mobile prop, the band mates and their entourage traversed the English countryside, hampered much of the time by a growing phalanx of media and fans who trailed their every move. Eventually, the production settled for several days in the large empty hangars of Kent’s West Malling Air Station, which doubled as their soundstage. At the end of October, McCartney traveled to Nice with a cameraman to film a daydream sequence, effectively bringing the movie’s principal photography to a close. All that was left for the group was a little slapdash post-production work with some color filters and film loops.While the quality of the film may have still been in doubt at this point, the Beatles’ music was sublime as always, including magnificent new fare like “I Am the Walrus” and “The Fool on the Hill” adorning the soundtrack. Indeed, the UK release of the Magical Mystery Tour EP in early December met with success throughout the holiday season, as did the LP release in the United States. Yet 1967 would end with a shudder for the Beatles—and most particularly for McCartney, who expected the movie to validate the band’s wide array of talents in art forms beyond the boundaries of pop music.As perhaps their single greatest artistic failure, the film version of Magical Mystery Tour showcases the band members in a beguiling series of burlesques that is memorable solely for its utter disarray. The movie’s chaotic narrative features musical iterations from Beatles films past, including a marching band’s intentionally cloying version of “She Loves You” and a string arrangement of “All My Loving” during a romantic interlude involving Ringo’s wanton Aunt Jessie (Jessie Robbins) and staid courier Buster Bloodvessel (Ivor Cutler).In the movie’s finest moments, the Beatles perform quasi-music videos for “The Fool on the Hill,” “I Am the Walrus,” and “Blue Jay Way.” The film reaches its ridiculous nadir in a variety of nonsensical skits—set in, of all places, an army recruiter’s office and a strip club—that attempt to recall the zany vignettes inherent in A Hard Day’s Night and Help!The poor reviews that Magical Mystery Tour received after its debut on Boxing Day (December 26th) on the BBC—which premiered the film in black and white, thus mitigating its multicolored virtues—revealed the awful reality of its failure. ABC television, which owned the rights to broadcast Magical Mystery Tour in the United States, opted not to air the film at all.The reviews, not surprisingly, were swift and merciless. “The bigger they are, the harder they fall. And what a fall it was,” James Thomas wrote in the Daily Express. “The whole boring saga confirmed a long held suspicion of mine that the Beatles are four pleasant young men who have made so much money that they can apparently afford to be contemptuous of the public.” Meanwhile, the Daily Sketch couldn’t help poking fun at the Beatles’ recent forays into Eastern mysticism: “Whoever authorized the showing of the film on BBC1 should be condemned to a year squatting at the feet of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi.” For its part, the Daily Mirror condemned Magical Mystery Tour as “Rubbish . . . Piffle . . . Nonsense!”But for the Beatles themselves, there was simply no way to spin the filmic disaster in their favor: it had proved to be a critical drubbing that was genuinely difficult to stomach—especially after the artistic heights that they had enjoyed with Sgt. Pepper only scant months before.__________Ken Womack is an internationally renowned Beatles authority regarding the band’s enduring artistic influence.

While the shape of New York’s skyline has changed, in Vergara’s images, the changes appear to be an essential part of the city’s identity. “The skyline is often how people relate to cities,” Vergara told The Huffington Post. “If a city has a skyline, it enters into a different category.

On Sunday, the Kansas City Chiefs locked arms during the anthem, and cornerback Marcus Peters raised his fist into the air.The Chiefs released a statement explaining their demonstration:After having a number of thoughtful discussions as a group regarding our representation during the national anthem, we decided collectively to lock arms as a sign of solidarity. It was our goal to be unified as a team and to be respectful of everyone’s opinions, and the remembrance of 9/11. It’s our job as professional athletes to make a positive impact on our communities and to be proactive when change is needed. Together we are going to continue to have conversations, educate ourselves and others on social issues and work with local law enforcement officials and leaders to make an impact on the Kansas City community.Similarly, the Seattle Seahawks have said they have decided as a team to stand and interlock their arms during the anthem on Sunday.“Progress can and will be made only if we stand together,” Doug Baldwin, a Seahawks wide receiver, said in a video he posted online announcing the team’s decision.On Thursday, Denver Broncos linebacker Brandon Marshall took a knee during the anthem ahead of a game against the Carolina Panthers.The players have been praised as high-profile allies of the Black Lives Matter movement, which grew as a response to a spate of police officers in cities around the country killing unarmed black men. About two-thirds of NFL players are black.The protests have also provoked anger in some fans who see the gesture as disrespecting the U.S. flag and the country in general.Sunday’s 13 games coincide with the 15th anniversary of the attacks by al Qaeda hijackers that brought down the two largest towers of the World Trade Center in New York City. The league will play videotaped messages from President Barack Obama and his predecessor, George W. Bush, before each game, and a 9/11 decal will be placed on players’ helmets, the league said.Kaepernick’s 49ers play their opening game against the Los Angeles Rams on Monday evening. Obama has defended Kaepernick, saying this week the player is exercising a constitutional right and provoking conversation “around some topics that need to be talked about.”(Reporting by Jonathan Allen; Editing by Alan Crosby)"

Oh, my God, that really just happened!” he shouts as he watches the scene from above.”Look at the people running!” a woman beside him says as she points to the ground below.Carnival blamed rough currents and wind conditions for pushing the vessel off course while departing the harbor city of Messina on Aug. 28. “The ship’s officers were forced to increase the vessel’s propulsion motors to control the ship’s movement and bring it back on course,” they said Sunday in a statement to The Huffington Post. “In the process, the force of the ship’s propeller wash in the harbor impacted a nearby floating dock and some small vessels which were damaged. No injuries were reported. The company sincerely apologizes for the matter and has been in close contact with Italian authorities to examine what transpired.”The local port authority estimated the damage to be around $280,800, according to a statement obtained by local media.“The cruise ship caused damages at two piers, one beyond repair, a number of ancillary facilities (such as anchor lines of the boats) damaged, a pilot of the mooring sunk and another dozen small boats in poor condition,” the statement read. “The estimated amounts of damages are over 250,000 EUR.”Though the Vista is Carnival’s largest ship, the cruise line hopes that it won’t be for long. Carnival recently announced that they have ordered two 180,000-ton ships. The world’s three largest cruise ships, owned by Royal Caribbean, each have a gross tonnage of more than 225,000.Both new Carnival ships will be powered by liquefied natural gas and are expected to make their debuts in 2020 and 2022.CORRECTION: Earlier versions of this story incorrectly stated that the three Royal Caribbean ships weighed more than 225,000 tons or could carry that amount.

After about age 11, she outgrew Justice and we hadn’t gone in the store for years. He ended up always begrudgingly trying on clothes from the boys’ departments along with his older brother. But he hated it. He avoided trying on clothes at all costs. Back-to-school shopping was a chore he dreaded to the extreme.Every time we made a trip to your next door neighbor store, Target, my son would longingly look in the windows of Justice and say, “I wish I could shop there.” But we never went in. There was just something off-putting about those words on your window, reading, “Just for Girls,” that kept us away time and time again. My son doesn’t identify as a girl, at least he hasn’t for as long as he has been able to communicate, although he has always acted like a stereotypical girl, played exclusively with stereotypical girls toys and has almost exclusively female friends.We’ve all been on a journey to understand his gender non-conformity, but finally my husband, myself and my two older cisgender children are all on the same page, and we’re just looking for ways to support our gender creative, in-transition, born-male child. He may one day be LGBTQ+. He may not. We’re open to whatever, as long as he’s happy, true to himself and not hurting anyone.Well, this year I was planning a trip with my son to Justice over spring break for some much wanted “sparkly” clothes. All excuses aside, I was going to take the plunge. I was literally planning on going the day after HB2 became NC law, March 23.This new law would ban transgender people from using public restrooms, showers, locker rooms and changing facilities that aligned with their gender identity. For example, a trans man who has a full beard, the build of a man, the voice of a man due to hormone blockers and testosterone injections, dresses like a stereotypical male, and for all intents and purposes appears very outwardly masculine would now be legally required to use the women’s restroom, if his gender markers weren’t changed on his birth certificate, or he wasn’t assigned male at birth. And vice versa ― trans women who haven’t changed their birth certificates are legally required to use men’s facilities.Instead of going to Justice that day, I ended up glued to my laptop, trying to understand what to make of this new, horrific anti-trans, excruciatingly discriminatory law based on hyped up fears over a “potential” crime that has never actually happened. I wondered what this meant for my son’s future, especially if he ends up transitioning to female.The summer came and went. My son settled on “boys” back to school clothes, and two pairs of “girls” Twinkle Toe sneakers, along with a hot pink, peach and purple backpack, and pink lunchbox shaped like a purse.I mentioned my son’s Justice wish to a group I founded and lead for parents of gender non-conforming and trans children. I wondered out loud whether a clothing store that touts itself as “just for girls” would be open to a boy trying on their clothes. Because of HB2, I wondered whether they’d have a legal right in N.C. to deny my son entry to a female dressing room.Thanks to a hero mom friend, all the vetting out was done. She did something I had been putting off. She physically went to your store, spoke to the store manager on duty, and asked questions from, “Would you let a boy try on clothes here?” to “What would you do if another customer made rude comments to a little boy looking at or trying on clothes here?” And much more.My friend reported all good news back to our group. The store manager assured her that “everyone is welcome at Justice,” and any rudeness or discrimination from fellow customers would not be tolerated. She spoke of how Justice’s parent company, Ascena, helped donate without question after the Orlando massacre at Pulse Nightclub. We definitely had an advocate at this store.Then, another hero friend sent my son a Justice e-Gift card that I could use right from my phone. It was then a done deal. We were going shopping.My son wanted to go immediately, but we had to get to school and it was 7:15 a.m. on a Tuesday. I told him, “maybe Friday.” So Friday afternoon at 4:45, I was leaving work and I decided to call the store to make sure our advocate was working. She was; however, she stated her shift was over at 5:15, but that the girl taking over after her was just as welcoming.We rushed to get there, and just around 5:10, we arrived. There were no other customers in the store. My son’s eyes were huge and overwhelmed with possibilities. The Justice store manager came right over to greet us, didn’t bat an eyelash, and basically took on the role of my son’s personal shopper for the evening.After getting a feel for what colors, textures and patterns he liked, our advocate showed us several possibilities, from sequined mini skirts to slim jeggings. My son LOVED them all. We went to the changing room, and my son couldn’t get those clothes on fast enough. Once that first outfit was on, he posed and admired himself in the mirror, spun around in circles to see the skirt poof out, and studied himself from all angles in every possible combination of outfits. It was pure joy. This ― in stark contrast to how he tries on “boys” clothing in other stores, when he won’t even put an outfit all the way on or refuses to try on at all. My son dropped his usual shopping doom and gloom look and suddenly sprang to life in these clothes. He even encouraged me to take pictures of him in the different outfits. There was no denying he became a different, more confident and happier child when wearing pretty things.I was blown away by the fact that our advocate Justice manager stayed well-past her shift’s end, just to continue working with us. She made my son feel beautiful and totally free of judgment. I want to thank her for that precious, precious gift. I rarely get to see my son reaching his full potential, his absolute true self in public. She encouraged that and even helped bring it out. I felt so much hope for the future.We left the store two hours later with two full bags, and I snapped a picture of my son standing by the store window that reads, “just for girls.” He was beaming and clutching his bags of new clothes, standing beside those words, “just for girls,” challenging the notion.I will leave you with a few pictures I took of some of his new outfits. Please look at his smile. This is as genuine as it gets. I think his cheeks hurt from smiling so much when we left.I want to say an extra special thank you to Ascena Retail Group, and to the Raleigh branch of Justice, at Poyner Place behind Triangle Town Center. I want to say a super-duper thanks to store manager, Stephnie, who went waaaaay above and beyond, for giving my son a safe place for two hours of his life that will no doubt impact his future in a big way.Thank you, thank you, thank you.Your most recent fan for life,Martie Sirois, parent of a gender non-conforming 10-year-old boy transitioning to become someone even more beautiful than he already is.Originally published at www.gendercreativelife.com*Since the publishing of this letter, Charlie has enjoyed a solid year in fifth grade wearing clothing and hair accessories from Justice, despite questions and confusion from some peers. For pronouns, Charlie now uses “they/them/their(s)” instead of “he/him/his.” Charlie identifies as non-binary (Enby), and gender non-conforming. When pressured to answer “are you a boy or a girl,” Charlie says, “I’m just a person.” Charlie’s parents founded a group called S.E.A.R.CH. (Safe Environment for the Acceptance of Rainbow CHildren), which is a playgroup for TGNC (Trans and/or gender non-conforming) children ages 12 and under, and discussion group for parents. This fall, S.E.A.R.CH. will celebrate its first year anniversary of being a permanent, year-round, monthly program of their local LGBT Center. "
8,QUEER VOICES,Tim Kaine Keynotes Human Rights Campaign National Dinner,"Peter D. Rosenstein, Contributornon-profit consultant, public speaker and political activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tim-kaine-keynotes-human_b_11967758.html,,2016-09-11,2016-09-11-1473627507-6209430-chadgriffinandJohnLewis.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-11-1473627507-6209430-chadgriffinandJohnLewis-thumb.JPG,"Saturday night saw 3,600 members of the LGBTQ community and their allies gather at the DC Convention Center for the Human Rights Campaign's (HRC) annual National Dinner. This year the chairs of the dinner were Bruce Rohr and June Crenshaw. June has now served in this capacity three times and has shown again what an amazing person she is. Things got started a little late but then it is a gay event so no one really complained. The press has a small seating section in the hall and one of the benefits of being there was the chance to chat with Sarah McBride who is a member of the communications team at HRC. Sarah was the first transgender person to ever address a national convention of a political party when she spoke at the Democratic National Convention. The HRC is officially a bi-partisan organization but it was clear from the thousands in the room they were in agreement with HRC's endorsement of Hillary Rodham Clinton for President. Any Donald Trump supporters would have felt very out of place in the room. Some HRC supporters walked the red-carpet, some I knew and most I didn't which may have been a generational thing. There was the incredibly talented Sharon Gless who has been an outspoken supporter of the LGBTQ community for years. I felt lucky to be able to thank her personally for all she has done. One of the biggest cheers came for Nyle DiMarco, winner of Top Model and Dancing with the Stars. Nyle is more than a sexy hunk. He is an eloquent spokesperson/activist for the deaf community. Then HRC President Chad Griffin posed for a picture with the amazing Congressman John Lewis who has been a civil rights activist since working with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. but has also stood arm-in-arm with the LGBTQ community and we honor and thank him for a career fighting for social justice and equality. The first major speaker of the evening was Chad Griffin. Over the years he has become a great speaker. He began by thanking attendees for being there and said ""because of all the progress you've helped make possible these last many years, countless Americans all across this country today are able to live fuller and more equal lives than they were just a short decade ago.""He spoke of lifting the ban on gay and transgender individuals serving in the military and the Supreme Court's decision making same-sex marriage legal in the country. He also reminded everyone ""despite all that we've accomplished, we are surrounded by constant reminders of just how far we still have to go in our fight for full equality. From Houston to North Carolina, from Orlando to Trump Tower, the roots of hatred and bigotry stretch far and wide. And this past year we've had to fight harder and dig deeper to push forward through some of the darkest times we have ever faced."" He spoke of the tragedy in Orlando at Pulse Nightclub and Christopher Drew Leinonen who with his boyfriend, Juan, both lost their lives at Pulse. He recognized and thanked Christopher's mother, Christine Leinonen, who was at the dinner. Christine is a beautiful person and has turned her grief into a positive thing joining the Board of the Pride Fund to help fight for sensible gun laws.Griffin then introduced the keynote speaker, Vice Presidential candidate Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA). What came through in Senator Kaine's speech is what all who know him already knew. Senator Kaine is a smart, decent man and one the country will be proud to call Vice-President. Senator Kaine always manages to speak to issues relating them to his life in a way people can easily understand and identify with. He spoke of how as a Catholic, despite some of the church's positions, he has come to understand and support what the full scope of equality means; whether it is civil rights, women's rights, the rights of immigrants or LGBTQ rights. Today he is a proud catholic who supports marriage-equality and is a sponsor of the Equality Act. He spoke of his support for sensible gun control and how his experience with the Virginia Tech shootings made such an indelible impression on him. He is married to Anne Holton, a successful person in her own right and the former Virginia Secretary of Education, and the daughter of A. Linwood Holton, Jr. a Republican Virginia Governor who fought to desegregate Virginia schools. Senator Kaine spoke of the opening of the military to gay and transgender persons and recognized Eric Fanning, the Secretary of the Army who was at the dinner, reminding all how far we have come when an incredibly qualified man who happens to be gay can be confirmed by the Senate.All-in-all this was another great event for the Human Rights Campaign. HRC has its supporters and detractors but few can question we will need this organization to stay strong for many years to come as we work to both change the law and fight for cultural acceptance, which will be harder to achieve."
9,RELIGION,"Hillary's Hymn: ""The Evils We Deplore""","Rev. Dr. Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite, ContributorProfessor of Theology, Chicago Theological Seminary",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillarys-hymn-the-evils-w_b_11966870.html,"Please God, grant us wisdom and courage to call out ""the evils we deplore"" and help us do better as a nation in valuing all people.",2016-09-11,2016-09-11-1473618104-4372092-25982411775_211b8a8ce7_b.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-09-11-1473618104-4372092-25982411775_211b8a8ce7_b-thumb.jpg,"""Save us from weak resignation to the evils we deplore.""You may be surprised to learn that's a line from the famous hymn God of Grace and God of Glory by the great American preacher and seminary teacher, Rev. Harry E. Fosdick, and not a Tweet from the last few days. After I heard Hillary's now famous description of half of Trump supporters as a basket of deplorables I realized I had started humming this wonderful hymn. Whether this was in the back of Hillary Clinton's mind (and Methodists do love to sing the old hymns), it certainly came to my mind. The deplorable views of Trump supporters are not a secret. Last month The New York Times published a shocking video of unfiltered voices from a Trump rally. The ""coarse, vitriolic, even violent language"" is so vile I choose not to reproduce it here. If you choose, you can follow the link. Racism, sexism, homophobia and xenophobia have all been on display in these events, and yes, without a doubt, these are evils. I do not think it is a mistake to call these out. In fact, I think the ""evils we deplore"" are at the heart of our country's struggle over who we are as a nation. Are we welcoming, diverse, and tolerant, or are we shutting our doors, privileging the white race, and intolerant of other religions and people from other countries? Evil is very poorly understood. It is not satanic forces, but in effect a huge collection of human sins that take on a life of their own and become a system. My co-author Mary Potter Engel, in our book Lift Every Voice: Constructing Christian Theology from the Underside makes this point that all the sins we commit create systems that ""tempt us toward injustice and impiety."" Individual sin and collective evil become mutually reinforcing. In other words, they become the ""evils we deplore."" Rev. Fosdick's hymn calls on God to ""Grant us wisdom, grant us courage"" to confront fear, to let go of greed and selfishness, and to be cured of the love of violence so manifest in our ""warring madness."" It is as contemporary a plea as we could want for ""the living of these days."" Please God, grant us wisdom and courage to call out ""the evils we deplore"" and help us do better as a nation in valuing all people."
10,TRAVEL,Aarhus - A Tale of Two Museums: Demented in Denmark on the Looney Front - Part 4,"Mike Arkus, ContributorJournalist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aarhus---a-tale-of-two-mu_b_11119542.html,,2016-09-11,2016-07-21-1469135577-9188777-Norwayplus20162377.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-07-21-1469135577-9188777-Norwayplus20162377-thumb.JPG,"Aarhus, Denmark's second city, has two major museums, one dealing with the cutting edge of modern art and conceptualism, the other delving back into the mists of Denmark's, and humanity's, distant past. Ironically the modernist palace, ARoS, now housed in a building based on Dante's Inferno and the Nine Circles of Hell, is the country's oldest public arts museum outside Copenhagen, founded in 1859. Its name comes from the Old Danish for Aarhus, Áros, with the capital letters spelling the Latin for art. The new building's underlying concept, basically a red brick cube topped in 2011 by a 492-foot long horizontal circular rainbow of glass panels that goes through, well, all the colours of the rainbow, draws on Dante's Divine Comedy and its description of the three stages of the afterlife - hell, purgatory and paradise - at least according to the museum's brochure.'Your rainbow panorama (as the topknot is called) completes the link between heaven and hell,' it adds. You enter on the 4th floor and are met by the sign Pause I Paradis (Stop in Paradise). Now I thought paradise would be at the top, but this being material Earth, this paradise is the gift shop.For the Nine Circles of Hell you descend the long spiral stairs (or take the lift) to floor 0, which I suppose is OK as they name the exhibit there 'The 9 Spaces.' It's appropriately dark within black walls, and includes an installation called 'Too Late' depicting the unkempt morning after a night of fun at a gay bar, and a cubicle with mirrors on all four walls, floor and ceiling sending back your own image ad infinitum - imaginatively called The Mirror.Once you've recovered from your infinite self, you can move on up to the 1st floor, where you're greeted by a lifelike but 15-foot-high squatting boy, entitled Boy. Under 'The many faces of Boy' the brochure asks: 'What is Boy and what is he doing here? Boy leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions.' Actually it seems pretty clear; he looks as if he's trying to crap in his canvas shorts.By the time you reach the 5th floor you come to the Robert Mapplethorpe exhibit. Now I'm no fan of his and I know I'll get clobbered as a philistine and ignoramus, but whatever his artistic genius, his innovative photographic ploys, his ingenious plays with light, a bullwhip sticking out of your own hairy arsehole is still just that - a bullwhip sticking out of your own hairy arsehole.They even have a bullwhip on display but I don't know if it's the original intruder.There are numerous self-portraits with the typical Mick Jaggerish moue, and much else. And, oh dear, now I've just snapped the 1976 photo of naked little Jesse McBride exposing his penis and the 1970 portrait of vagina-splaying little Rosie, and I'll be arrested for trading in paedophilia. If you want something along these lines but more home produced, ascend to the 6th circle and enjoy an aerial dick - a video of a man lying naked on his back while a model airplane attached by twine to his penis goes round and round, lifting, twirling and reposing said member. The video section is called 'Happiness and Misery.' It doesn't say to which rubric aerial dick belongs.  Finally your reach the rainbow at the end of the pot, so to speak, Danish-Icelandic artist Ólafur Elíasson's 'Your Rainbow Panorama.' It does indeed give you a glorious 360-degree angel's eye view of the city through all the colours of the rainbow, the hues shading into each other as you proceed along the walkway. Talk about seeing Aarhus through rose-tinted glasses.At the other end of the space-time continuum, away in the suburbs, is the Moesgaard Museum, also housed in a modernist building, but home to archaeological and ethnographic displays. With an enormous sloping roof covered with grass and walkways, it's the final resting place of 2,300-year-old Grauballe Man, whose body was found in a peat bog near the village of Grauballe in 1952.Considered the best bog body in the world, as bogs preserve corpses naturally, its owner was a man who in the 3rd century BC was apparently sacrificed to appease Germanic gods, the evidence showing that his throat was slit. The body is so well preserved that his finger prints have been taken - but he has not yet been charged. Two other bog bodies accompany him in the dimly lit cavern, a mock-up of a burial mound on the lowest floor, a highlight of its People from the Past exhibit. Other offerings to the gods found in the bogs include the skulls of horses and dogs as well as a wooden phallus. The amazing show of weapons, tools, pots, broaches and other ornaments from the Nordic and Germanic lands on show range from as early as 1700 BC to the end of the Viking empire, if you can call it such. Another highlight are the dioramas and models, and the video reenactment of the battle of Illerup Ådal, where in 205 AD an enemy army apparently arrived on the coast, and what the museum calls 'one of the greatest battles in the history of the Iron Age' ensued. This is based on the more than 15,000 items, mainly weapons and personal equipment, apparently captured and thrown into the lake as votive offerings.The skeletal remains of hundreds of Iron Age warriors were recently found nearby, possibly sacrificed prisoners. The reenactment is great fun. You stand in a room with the opposing armies on either wall, and video arrows and spears rain down on either side, along with appropriate sounds and music. On an upper floor you can attend a video reenactment of Roman gladiatorial spectacles with gladiators and animals killing each other.Perhaps the most ironic exhibit of all is the staircase leading down to archaeological display. At the top is a model of 3.2-million-year-old Lucy, everybody's favourite australopithecine grandmother found in Ethiopia, passing by in descending order 2-million-year-old Sediba man from South Africa, 1.5-million-year-old Turkana Boy from Kenya, and a nice Neanderthal model.It ends on the last steps with a representative of Homo Sapiens - Koelbjerg Woman from 9,000 years ago, the world's oldest bog body, found near the eponymous Danish village. Doubtless unwittingly but arguably correctly, the museum shows the Descent, not Ascent of Man.OK, time for a walk in the lovely beech forest outside where a Viking Trail passes mockups of Viking buildings. After a couple of miles you end up at a beach on the Baltic coast.[Upcoming blog next Sunday: The churches and castles of Schleswig-Holstein]______________ By the same author: Bussing The Amazon: On The Road With The Accidental Journalist, available with free excerpts on Kindle and in print version on Amazon.

Doubtless unwittingly but arguably correctly, the museum shows the Descent, not Ascent of Man.OK, time for a walk in the lovely beech forest outside where a Viking Trail passes mockups of Viking buildings. After a couple of miles you end up at a beach on the Baltic coast.[Upcoming blog next Sunday: The churches and castles of Schleswig-Holstein]______________ By the same author: Bussing The Amazon: On The Road With The Accidental Journalist, available with free excerpts on Kindle and in print version on Amazon.

At the same time, the results of the Great Elephant Census, funded by Microsoft founder Paul Allen, were released.Undertaken by a team of scientists and conservationists -- including WCS's Dr. Paul Elkan, Falk Grossmann and other WCS field staff, working in cooperation with government wildlife departments -- the census has documented that savanna elephants have declined at a rate of 27,000 -- or 8 percent -- per year, with a total of 144,000 lost in less than a decade. The surveys also revealed that several populations, particularly in West and Central Africa, are at dangerously low levels -- risking local extinction.The shutting down of domestic ivory markets would send a clear signal to traffickers and organized criminal syndicates that ivory is worthless and will no longer support their criminal activities.

This is a real thing. Every year Amusement Today hosts their annual Golden Ticket Awards, recognizing amusement parks, rides, and leaders in the amusement industry for their outstanding achievements. The majority of winners are selected by coaster enthusiasts around the world, who each fill out a ballot, marking which they personally feel should be considered the best of the best. September 10th marked the announcement of this years awards, which were held at the Roller Coaster Capital of the World, Cedar Point.Cedar Point has always been considered one of the best amusement parks in the world, and also brought in a new coaster for this year, so it was very fitting that they hosted this years ceremony.Lets take a look at this years winners, starting with the most anticipated award- The Best New Ride for 2016. Now this year was an exceptional year for new thrill rides, which likely made 2016 particularly difficult for voters. Lets look at our top candidates: Valravn: Located at the host park for this years awards, Valravn is the worlds tallest, fastest, and longest dive coaster. It is Cedar Points 18th roller coaster, and for sure is a hit with the public. Riders descend down a 214 foot 90 degree drop, and are then thrown through a total of 3 inversions.Storm Chaser: Located in Louisville, Kentucky, at a park called Kentucky Kingdom, is a revamp of the parks old Twisted Twins dueling wooden coasters. Together the two rides were combined to make the extreme thrill ride, which features the only barrel roll drop in the United States. Together it packs in numerous airtime moments, a couple of inversions, and lis guaranteed to leave a smile on your face!Lightning Rod: One of the most anticipated rides of the year can be found in the Smoky Mountains of Tennessee, at Dollywood. Even though it had a bit of a rough start, this coaster holds the record for the fastest wood coaster, as well as the first & only launched wooden roller coaster. Those who have experienced it have called it an incredible experience, and one of the best rides in the world.Mako: The only Hyper coaster to be built this year by B&M was Mako, at SeaWorld Orlando. Sitting at a height of 200 feet, this is now the tallest and fastest coaster in Orlando. Themed to the speed of the Mako shark, rides travel out and back up against a water bed through a series of huge camelback hills. Many who have experienced it claim it to be one of the best of its kind.  ©SeaWorld OrlandoSwitchback: Though it technically opened last year, it had a bit of a late start, which qualified it for this years awards. You can find this ride in Seguin, Texas, about an hour east of San Antonio. Though it may be small, boy does this ride pack a punch! It remains the only wooden shuttle coaster to go forwards and backwards, as well as technically holds the record for steepest drop on a wood coaster. Interestingly, Switchback was featured as one of the top finalists over some coasters that actually opened this year, such as The Joker at Six Flags Discovery Kingdom or Monster at Adventureland. Something also to consider was that none of the new coasters overseas made it into the top five. This may be due to the amount of voters that actually managed to get on these new attractions, which likely was minimal. So now that you know the candidates, which ride took the award? Lightning Rod at Dollywood! Among the coaster community, this seemed to be by far the most anticipated ride of the year. Though I have yet to experience it for myself, I cannot wait to one day get on it! Congratulations to everyone at Dollywood and Rocky Mountain Construction for putting together a great ride!So now that we know the best ride of the year, lets run through some of the other awards given out:Best Dark Ride- Tower of Terror at Disney's Hollywood Studios Friendliest Park, as well as Best Shows- Dollywood in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee Dollywood Best Carousel, as well as Best Food- Knoebels in Elysburg, Pennsylvania Best Funhouse- Noah's Ark at Kennywood in West Mifflin, Pennsylvania Best Marine Park- SeaWorld Orlando, in Florida Best Childrens Park- Idlewild & SoakZone, in Ligonier, Pennsylvania Best Boardwalk Park- Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, in California Best Water Ride- Valhalla at Blackpool Pleasure Beach, in England Best Water Park Ride- Wildebeest at Holiday World & Splashin' Safari, in Santa Claus, Indiana. Holiday World also won the award for Cleanest Park. Best Kids Area- Planet Snoopy at Kings Island, in Mason, Ohio Best Indoor Roller Coaster- Revenge of the Mummy at Universal Studios Florida, in Orlando Best Landscaping- Busch Gardens Williamsburg Best Christmas Event- Smoky Mountain Christmas at Dollywood Best Halloween Event- Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Orlando Resort, in FloridaSo that leaves only four awards left. Best Wood/Steel Coaster, and Best Water/Amusement Park. Though there weren't too many surprises here, one ride certainly surprised many of us and that was the award for best steel coaster. Ever since it opened, Millennium Force at Cedar Point has been voted the best, if not one of the best coasters in the world. Very few rides have ever overthrown its title.Until now. Ladies and Gentlemen, the new Best Steel Coaster in the world is...Fury 325 at Carowinds is my personal favorite roller coaster of all time, and I know many others share the same #1. You can imagine my excitement when it too 1st place! At a height of 325 feet, reaching speeds of 90 mph, not only does it feature airtime, but great forces and a long ride time. Few can argue against it being, simply put, one of the greatest rides ever created. But for those still Millennium Force fans, fear not. It now has a ranking of #2.As for the other final awards, few were surprised. Boulder Dash at Lake Compounce once again has taken the title for best wooden roller coaster. Schlitterbahn in New Braunfels took Best Water Park, and Europa Park in Germany won Best Amusement Park for the 3rd year in a row.Congratulations to all the winners, and everyone who made this years awards possible. Next years awards will be held at Quassy Amusement Park and Lake Compounce.It's always an exciting time of the year for enthusiasts, and overall I myself was pleased with the turnouts. Though we all have our different opinions, the polls really do reflect the thought of the mass community of coaster enthusiasts. On a slight side note, if you're looking for a bit of fun, a bit of a spoof was posted to the Coaster Studios YouTube channel, in a way poking fun of the awards.

(AP Photo/Luca Bruno)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb829f7240000510057381c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The latest joke in our absurd presidential campaign is that Russian President Vladimir Putin sees Donald Trump as a strong leader. This is causing belly-laughs in the Kremlin. People in Putin's inner circle say that Putin considers Trump a buffoon, easily manipulated by flattery, without a scintilla of knowledge or depth about the world outside his golf courses. Moreover, Trump's stated willingness to recognize Putin's annexation of Crimea, to lift sanctions, not to object to the occupation of an area in Ukraine, to withdraw promises of support for NATO allies in the Baltic, and for NATO as a whole, is the Russian dictator's dream. Putin was a big winner in the Brexit vote as it shook the strength of the EU, a rival political power (and was probably bemused at Trump's happiness that it was good for business of his golf course in Scotland. Geopolitical benefit for Putin vs. more business (perhaps) for Trump's golf course is, in Trump's world, a win. Keep that in mind.)According to Putin insiders, he sees Trump as a weaker, far more ignorant, wholly self-absorbed version of Neville Chamberlain. Easy-pickin's.Putin also knows Trump cannot resist a good deal, ie, that benefits him personally. If Trump were president, Putin knows he can offer bargain-basement terms on choice property in Moscow and in St Petersberg, for example, for Trump's company to build hotels in exchange for geopolitical concessions from the U.S. that have no impact on Trump's wealth. And, here's the kicker: Trump would walk away believing HE got the better of Putin, and brag about it!Putin, remember, was KGB. He has used psy-ops on U.S. leaders before. Learning that George W. Bush was religious, Putin displayed a cross around his neck at their first meeting, pointing out that his grandmother had given it to him. Soon thereafter, W proclaimed that he had looked into Putin's eyes, seen his soul, and that he was someone we could work with. Indeed, Bush, who also looks like Hercules compared to Trump, is an object lesson in claims of ""global strength."" When Putin invaded the Republic of Georgia, and took permanent control of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, what did the 'strong' Bush Administration do? Nothing. Trump likely has no idea where Georgia is, and has never heard of, and cares nothing for those two other states.When Putin did the same in Crimea and now occupies part of Ukraine, what did the Obama Administration do? Impose sanctions (those are the ones Trump will lift) of increasing scope, reiterate its commitment to the Baltic States (the ones Trump would betray), and provide aid to the Ukrainian government. Who acted with more strength, Obama or Bush? There has been speculation that Putin might not seek another term. But, if Trump were the US President, it is hard to believe that this psyops master would give up on the opportunity of a lifetime, having a U.S. leader literally eating out of his hand with little effort. Now, of course, Putin must publicly disavow such favoritism, and build up Trump as a tough opponent in order to insure his election. But there is no reason to believe it. After all, as presidential candidate, Trump has already signaled his readiness to appease Russia, hired a campaign manager who waged another campaign to undermine NATO, and even begged Russia to violate U.S. law to hack the Clinton campaign. And, of course, has undisclosed ties to Russian oligarchs himself.What more could Putin want? He is licking his chops. Brace yourselves for an October surprise."

Commissioners and staff traveled to 28 foreign countries, convened 33 major conferences, collecting information and ideas from hundreds of expert witnesses on a comprehensive range of security threats, but also security opportunities. Our focus was consistently on the differences the world of the early 21st century would represent from the 20th. Very early in our deliberations we became convinced that the new era of terrorism would visit the American homeland sooner rather than later and with potential catastrophic consequences.Early on, in interim public reports, we warned that, ""Terrorists will likely attack the United States and Americans will die on American soil, possibly in large numbers."" In our final report to the new George W. Bush administration eleven days after its inauguration, we repeated that stark warning in print to the President and in person to the Secretaries of State and Defense and to the new National Security Adviser.We were specifically and deeply concerned that the three principal agencies with responsibility for border protection, the Coast Guard, Customs Service and Border Patrol, were accountable to three separate Cabinet officers in separate Departments and did not possess a common communications system or data base. Watch lists were haphazard and often not shared. Thus, our first recommendation was to create a U.S. Department of Homeland Security responsible to one Cabinet officer who would be accountable to the President, Congress and the American people.The new administration did not undertake that effort until more than nine months after the tragedy of 9/11, and it is still attempting to achieve full effectiveness. Nonetheless, the great government of the United States, in the eight months between our urgent recommendation and 9/11, could, at the very least, have created that communication system and data base among the border agencies and vastly increased the chances of identifying the terrorist plotters.We Americans are steadfast, even courageous, in responding to attacks on our nation. We are less than steadfast at anticipating, preparing for, and preventing those attacks. We who write these words believe that future terrorist attacks are virtually inevitable. They may or may not utilize commercial aircraft in their purposes. But a cyber shutdown of our air traffic control system might cost multiple numbers of casualties beyond 9/11, a similar cyber attack on our highly computerized financial systems would wreck our economy, and much of the rest of the world, until repaired. And who is to determine whether a highly contagious viral pandemic was the work of nature or biological terrorists.A great nation such as ours cannot function on perpetual high alert, nor will we become a frightened people. But eternal vigilance requires informed, serious and concerned citizens. We owe it to those who perished to do nothing less.Given our experience, as vivid in our memories today as it was watching thousands of our fellow citizens perish on television fifteen years ago, one should not wonder why these thoughts are still on our minds.Convinced of peril yet unable to generate administrative or legislative action, against the backdrop of that intense experience, we cannot help but ponder whether, possibly for the remainder of a lifetime, we could have and should have done more."

For me it lives on in a memory of another fifteenth anniversary.I was fifteen years old when I first saw Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey in 1968 -- old enough to be awestruck, smart enough to appreciate its stunning technical realism, and socially inept enough to tolerate the less-than-stellar dialog. I knew I didn't fully understand this movie, but I loved it. I saw it several times that year and bought a copy of the soundtrack album. I even bought one of the thin but expensive souvenir booklets they sold in the theater lobby, which I mistakenly thought would explain the mysterious ending.A Time of HopeThe energy and optimism of that time were palpable. America was still surfing a wave of postwar prosperity. The race to the moon was nearing its climax, and we were winning. Within my living memory, which back then spanned little more than a decade, we had gone from humbling explosions on the launch pad to the majestic Saturn V. The robotic Mariner 4 spacecraft had returned the first flyby images of Mars three years earlier. Eight months after 2001 was released, Apollo 8 would orbit the moon. Seven months after that, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin would walk on it. Our progress in robotic and human space exploration was stunning. Image credit: MGM/KubrickKubrick and Clarke's extrapolation of this trend thirty three years into the future seemed completely plausible. Of course we would have lunar colonies in 2001. Of course we would have Hilton hotels and Howard Johnson's restaurants in giant, wheel-shaped space stations. Of course we could just book a flight to the moon on Pan Am. And the film's optimism was not merely technical. In 2001 we would share the space station with the Soviets, who would also have lunar colonies, and only a hint of cold-war suspicion would persist. Humanity would have mostly conquered its inner demons, and now we would cooperate to explore the cosmos.The collision with reality began well before the real 2001 arrived. The Soviet Union disintegrated, only to be replaced by an equally dysfunctional oligarchy. Our postwar economic boom ended, and wrenching economic changes obliterated whole industries while creating new ones. Our expansive vision of human space exploration was choked off by budget constraints and confined to low earth orbit.

Pan Am went bankrupt, weakened by the bombing of Flight 103 and finished off by high oil prices following the first Persian Gulf War. Kubrick and Clarke's hopeful vision was on its deathbed by the turn of the millennium, and the 9/11 attacks finally killed it. The real 2001 would be remembered, not for lunar colonies and contact with extraterrestrials, but for a barbaric act of primitive religious hatred.What went wrong?Part of the problem was the extrapolation of postwar American economic growth, which turned out to be a transient anomaly. But most of it had to do with those inner demons, which in some parts of the world were being conjured, not exorcised, during the pre-millennial decades. The Wahhabi doctrine of violent jihad is now the most toxic of Saudi exports. Fifteen of the nineteen hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi citizens.Of course tribalism and violence have always been part of human nature -- a central theme, ironically enough, in the opening prehistoric sequence of Kubrick's movie. Violence also characterized the year of its release: the Tet offensive, the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy, race riots, and the blood-stained protests at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago.But we are flexible animals, and another of our evolutionary endowments is a propensity, during childhood, to accept on faith whatever our parents teach us. This is a big part of what makes human cultural evolution possible. We can teach our children kindness and tolerance for all of humanity, or we can teach them bigotry and religious fundamentalism. Indoctrination of either kind tends to last a lifetime. We are probably stuck with Islamist violence and turmoil in the Middle East for at least another generation. A repeat of 9/11 seems unlikely, but other kinds of terrorist attacks seem inevitable.Our best hope is educational reform in the Muslim world -- reform that emphasizes tolerance, freedom of expression, religious pluralism, and real education in the arts and sciences. There is a small but growing movement for this in Muslim countries, mainly among a tiny and often persecuted secular minority. It will take decades, and the process has barely begun. We should do all we can to nurture it.

I heard the words ""thought leader"" and ""summit,"" and my brain immediately went to ""conference.""I was proven wrong almost immediately. HATCH, an off-the-grid creativity symposium held annually at Moonlight Basin in Big Sky, Montana, is the opposite of a conference. It's a global network of dreamers and thinkers whose connections only strengthen when the event is over. It's a place where ideas are sparked and a community that turns them into powerful realities. Yarrow Kraner, a radical idealist and connector of extraordinary humans, created HATCH in 2004. Back then, phrases like ""intentional gathering"" and ""innovation superhighway"" were considered revolutionary, and intellectual vacations like Summit Series and Adult Summer Camp didn't exist. HATCH had the market cornered -- and it was so much more than an intellectual vacation on an innovation superhighway.""Back then, many of the terms we used were not buzzwords,"" Kraner tells me with a smile when I needle him for the phrasing he uses to describe his brainchild. ""When we founded HATCH, it was just us and TED.""In the years that followed, Kraner assembled an unstoppable network of artists, entrepreneurs and activists. Various amalgamations come together in Montana each year to exchange ideas, insights and inspirations. Partnerships are born and programs are launched, and the network grows and strengthens with each passing event.HATCH Latin America 2016 from VOLTA create on Vimeo.""We want HATCH to represent a true cross-section of humanity,"" Kraner explains, adding that he handpicks attendees for each event in an effort to maximize the potential for valuable connections. ""I search for people who are pushing the envelope, taking risks, and working hard to make scalable positive change.""His motivation is simple, pure, and beautifully earnest: to use HATCH to hatch a better world. ""We support those trying to create solutions to better humanity,"" he says, ""because we are in a no-joke race between consciousness and catastrophe.""Earlier this year, Kraner ventured from the mountains of Montana to the jungles of Panama to host his inaugural HATCH Latin America event at Kalu Yala, the sustainable community where I spent much of this past year living and working. There, I had deep conversations with astronauts and environmentalists. I learned about water policy and arts education. I answered hard questions like ""what am I asking for from life?"" I played in drum circles and invented products. I prototyped solutions for addressing climate change in remote parts of the world. I had idea orgasm after idea orgasm. By the end of the event, I wanted to scamper up the nearest banana tree and scream ""I can do anything because of HATCH!"" like a howler monkey.Other attendees share my sentiments. ""Hunting for the right tribe is important,"" says Mark Goerner, a regular HATCHer and an accomplished concept designer, most notably for Minority Report. ""A group defined by not by geography and social geology, but by tone, temperament and direction. Taking the energy to attempt new, challenging and thoughtful projects with these people may be the recipe that has the highest chance of impacting the world.""With the 16th HATCH experience kicking off in Big Sky, Montana, this week, I decided to revisit some of the ideas hatched during my own jungle experience. Below are five innovative, world-bettering collaborations moving forward, as the saying goes, #becauseofHATCH.Urban design that inspires action. Artist Susan Israel teamed up with architect Elias Cattan to design renderings that turn landfill into its natural river state while creating public open spaces throughout the greater Boston area. ""We are helping to develop a framework for how to use climate change resiliency land planning as a process that can remediate several problems at once, and leave us with better places than before,"" Israel explains.Entertainment that empowers minorities. Comedian Esteban Gast and Emmy award-winning TV host Pili Montilla are in the process of creating ""Los Nuevos Americanos,"" a college performance series aimed at empowering young Latinos. ""We have long recognized the need for more Latino role models,"" Gast says. ""We want to use our platform as entertainers for positive social impact.""International education with local benefits. I paired up with Panamanian entrepreneur, economist and designer Diwi Valiente to create the Diwi Valiente Media Lab Scholarship at Kalu Yala. Through the money we raised in our scholarship fund, three local Panamanian students were given the opportunity to attend my summer media lab program, which trains young people to tell stories about sustainability, at a reduced tuition rate.A tool that promotes transparency. Through his work at HATCH, Goerner is developing an app called Eqogo, which connects people and businesses to consciously-made products. ""This idea in particular came to light through an exercise scripted by the HATCH team, and fed later by others' enthusiasm for the idea,"" he says.Music with an important message. Renowned beatboxing musician Butterscotch worked with fellow HATCHer Mary John Frank to create a music video for her single ""Accept Who I Am,"" which emphasizes the power of self-love. ""Whenever I perform this song at shows, I always have people come up to me and say how touched they were because they know how it feels to be depressed, oppressed and suicidal,"" Butterscotch says. ""I wanted this video to reach as many people as possible who have been through the same thing as me and know that they are not alone.""""Accept Who I Am"" - Official Music Video - Butterscotch from Butterscotch Music on Vimeo.Learn more about HATCH here."
23,POLITICS,Clinton Just Played Trump's Game. Can She Beat Him At It?,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-deplorables_us_57d45848e4b00642712dda7d,"Spotlighting the racism of his crowds shouldn't be controversial. But, as she found out, she has to choose the right words.",2016-09-10,"Clinton's ""deplorables"" comment was characterized as tone deaf.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Let’s stipulate that Hillary Clinton is at least partially right. When the former secretary of state appeared at a fundraiser on Friday night and said that a chunk of Donald Trump’s supporters were “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic,” it wasn’t a feat of groundbreaking analysis.There is a massive amount of publicly available polling showing that the backers of the Republican nominee believe that President Barack Obama is not American and that blacks are more violent than whites. Most Jewish reporters can attest to receiving anti-Semitic quips from Trump fans in their inboxes or Twitter feeds on a regular basis.And in a bit of cognitive dissonance, many of the same Twitter accounts expressing shock with Clinton’s remarks had, moments earlier, helped make viral a news clip of NBC’s Katy Tur tutoring former Rep. Jack Kingston (a Trump surrogate) on the often racist and Islamophobic tone of Trump events. All of this is evidence enough of Clinton’s point. And this doesn’t even broach the topic of Trump’s own words and the people he has chosen to run his campaign.Let’s also note that the formulation used by Clinton at the Friday fundraiser isn’t new. She gave a heavily billed speech denouncing the rise of the alt-right movement and pegging it to Trump’s candidacy. And she continued from there. In a recent interview on Israeli television she copped to being “grossly generalistic” in breaking down Trump supporters into “two big baskets,” one of which she called the now infamous term: “the deplorables.” So it was bewildering for many Clinton supporters to see that ― after talking about this issue for weeks and highlighting a plainly observable feature of Trump’s rise ― Clinton was being called to task. The question they commonly asked was why, seemingly, was it more outrageous to call out the presence of racism than it is to actually spout those racist views? It isn’t, of course. But by morning, it was also clear that Clinton’s comments posed problems, both for the awkward word choice ― what exactly are “deplorables,” and why are they being put in a basket? ― and because she had said that half of all Trump supporters resided in that basket. (There likely would have been no controversy at all had she simply said that “a portion” did).Party officials were worried that, absent an apology, coverage would distract and unnerve the campaign and risk ceding some of the moral high ground Clinton enjoys. “It’s one thing to attack your opponent, another to attack the people supporting him in such denigrating terms,” said Lis Smith, a top aide to former presidential candidate Martin O’Malley and a critic of the comment. “It’s fair game to note that he has the support of white nationalists, but saying that half of his supporters are deplorables is tone deaf and off the mark.” What Clinton’s campaign chose to do was to take a third route. They played Trump’s game, apologizing without an actual apology for speaking in controversial terms about a certain demographic. In a statement offered on Saturday, Clinton said she regretted estimating the percentage of Trump supporters who are “deplorables” but not the use of the word itself. Last night I was ‘grossly generalistic,’ and that’s never a good idea. I regret saying ‘half’ ― that was wrong. But let’s be clear, what’s really ‘deplorable’ is that Donald Trump hired a major advocate for the so-called ‘alt-right’ movement to run his campaign and that David Duke and other white supremacists see him as a champion of their values.In copping only to a gross generalization, Clinton’s campaign assured that the discussion over deplorables would continue.This wasn’t the final step of some grand plan charted weeks ago. After all, she has been using this formulation for some time without notice. But it would also be wrong to say that Clinton’s team is entirely displeased with how the conversation developed after its initial rough launch.Debating what percentage of Trump’s base is racist certainly is preferable to talking about email protocols. But beyond that, the campaign’s goal, since the convention, has been to cleave moderate Republican voters away from Trump. An extended discussion of his incendiary comments, his campaign and his own nature is not the worst vehicle to do that.That strategy is not without risk. Trump, with little sense of irony, attacked Clinton for bigotry and hatred for her “deplorables” comment. And even some Democrats worry that Clinton leaves this dust-up looking smug (that she made the comments at a fundraiser featuring Barbra Streisand is, for them, a comical and nightmarish thread to this entire saga). For that reason, many commentators have compared the entire episode to Mitt Romney’s infamous “47 percent” gaffe ― a comparison Trump advisers quickly made, though without noting that Trump himself defended Romney in that moment.But Clinton’s supporters are prepared to litigate this debate precisely because they feel that analogy falls short. Clinton wasn’t talking about half the country, just half of the people who support Trump. And while Romney castigated the poor for being government moochers, she was attacking, well, racists and racism ― terrain that is a bit easier to defend. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misspelled Barbra Streisand’s first name as Barbara. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The high-profile anchor selected will inevitably be part of the debate story. The fear is becoming the whole story. This is the first time in recent memory that the moderator’s role has come under such intense scrutiny in the weeks leading up to the first presidential face-off. The pressure for network executives to make sure their marquee journalists are up to speed has only increased after the widespread criticism leveled at Matt Lauer, who moderated a presidential forum Wednesday night. (The Commander-in-Chief forum, featuring Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, was widely seen as a dry run for the Sept. 26 main event.) Even before the Lauer debacle, journalists were already expressing concerns that debate moderators would refrain from challenging candidates’ outright lies. Fox News anchor Chris Wallace, the moderator for the third debate, said on Sunday that he doesn’t intend to be “a truth squad” and that the candidates are responsible for rebutting one another’s claims. The other three presidential debate moderators ― NBC’s Holt, ABC’s Martha Raddatz and CNN’s Anderson Cooper ― along with vice presidential debate moderator Elaine Quijano, of CBS News, have kept silent all week as to whether or not they agree.Wallace’s perspective prompted me to imagine Monday how, without a moderator who pushes back, Trump could get away with repeating his lie about being a staunch opponent of the Iraq War. That scenario played out 48 hours later when Lauer didn’t fact-check Trump’s false Iraq claim, along with failing to point out that the Republican nominee supported the 2011 U.S. intervention in Libya.In response to Lauer’s poor performance, The New York Times editorial board ominously warned Friday of a “debate disaster waiting to happen.”“If the moderators of the coming debates do not figure out a better way to get the candidates to speak accurately about their records and policies — especially Mr. Trump, who seems to feel he can skate by unchallenged with his own version of reality while Mrs. Clinton is grilled and entangled in the fine points of domestic and foreign policy — then they will have done the country a grave disservice,” the editorial board wrote.On Wednesday night, Trump blustered his way through a primetime event without any discernible grasp of foreign policy and lied about his pre-Iraq war position. This surely isn’t the first time. In March, Trump made 71 claims deemed “inaccurate, misleading or deeply questionable” in the course of a single CNN town hall. Clinton, too, has made false or misleading statements this election season, according to fact-checkers, but with nowhere near Trump’s frequency or brazenness, such as claiming to have watched events that never happened.There’s nothing stopping the presidential debate moderators from fact-checking Trump or Clinton if they stray from the truth, according to the co-chairs of the Commission on Presidential Debates, the bipartisan group that’s overseen the events since 1988.“We give our moderators full discretion,” Republican co-chair Frank Fahrenkopf told HuffPost. “They’re the ones who run the debates. We have no idea what the questions are going to be. Once the light goes on, the show is theirs.”Fahrenkopf said his personal view is that the “the job of the moderator is not to be a fact-checker” and that the candidates should challenge each other’s claims during the debate. “If the candidate doesn’t do it, it is a very fine line the moderator has to walk down because the moderator doesn’t want to be the story,” he added.That’s essentially what happened four years ago when former CNN anchor Candy Crowley controversially waded into a dispute between President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney as to whether the former had used the words “act of terror” on Sept. 12, 2012, to describe the Benghazi attacks.Obama used those three words on the day after the attacks, as Crowley pointed out in backing up the president’s point. But conservative critics ― and even some nonpartisan voices like Washington Post “Fact-checker” columnist Glenn Kessler ― argued it wasn’t absolutely clear that Obama was referring to Benghazi on Sept. 12 and that the administration had dragged its feet in calling the attacks terrorist in nature, as Romney more broadly contended. In the months after the debate, Fahrenkopf said it was a “mistake” to have Crowley moderate. Mike McCurry, the Commission’s Democratic co-chair, told HuffPost that he and Fahrenkopf “mildly disagree” about Crowley, though he also expressed reservations about moderators fact-checking during the debates. “I thought Candy was just trying to move it along but it shows the hazard of the ‘fact check’ by the moderator,” McCurry said. “In general I think with the candidates side by side it is their responsibility to fact check each other. I have no doubt in the ability of the leading candidates this time around to do that.”In addition to calls for the moderators to point out lies, the networks themselves could do real-time, on-screen fact-checking, as Daily Beast columnist Michael Tomasky argued on Thursday. Both CNN and MSNBC have fact-checked bogus claims on screen in recent months.Fahrenkopf said the networks carrying the debate feed are permitted to use graphics on screen as they wish. He noted that some, in the past, have run real-time focus group results during the debates.But he generally disapproves of networks running anything potentially distracting on screen while the candidates speak.“It’s up to the network, but I frown on it,” he said. “I think it interrupts what the people are seeing. They get their talking heads after the debate.”"

He’s boasted about the size of his penis on national television. He’s bragged about his wealth and how beautiful his buildings are. He’s taken joy in insulting fellow candidates and reporters and even attacked the family of a soldier killed in Iraq. And he’s long shared stories of his sexual promiscuity.But those who attended the Values Voter Summit, the annual gathering of religious conservatives where Trump spoke on Friday, were willing to look past those actions. While they acknowledged that Trump hasn’t exactly been a saint, they said they were willing to forgive him.“I know that Donald Trump may not be Jesus Christ but he’s a lot better option for me than Hillary Clinton is,” attendee Hannah Holt told The Huffington Post. Holt added that Trump’s behavior “should bother anyone,” but that Democratic candidate Clinton wasn’t perfect either.“I mean, your husband was on a public stage in a public forum as one of the leaders of this entire world and was fooling around. Neither candidate is a good option in that area,” she said.In his remarks on Friday, Trump spoke about the power of religion to bring people together, but he did not talk about his own faith. He even bragged about how many evangelicals had supported him in the Republican primary.“All across the nation, a lot of people said: ‘I wonder if Donald will get the evangelicals?’ I got the evangelicals. I’m going to make it up to you too, you watch,” he said. “There are no more decent, devoted, or selfless people than our Christian brothers and sisters here in the United States.”Many attendees admitted that they were uncomfortable with Trump’s boasting.“As far as his values and morals go, we’re all a little bit iffy about it because you know he’s said some things that are kind of on the line. He is technically a conservative but he says thing a lot of the time that we don’t agree with,” Mitsy Cardoso said.For some, Trump’s boastfulness and his other flaws simply humanize him.“The thing I appreciate is that even though he has a life that I don’t necessarily agree with and I hope I’d make better choices, I think it tells everybody a story that all of us make mistakes, we’re not perfect,” Joe Tegerdine said.Heidi Pezdek, who came to the summit from Indiana, said that while Trump’s actions did “not reflect Christian values,” she believed recently he had changed and was becoming more Christian.“We are not looking for a perfect candidate. We’re looking for a candidate that takes good counsel and has strong leadership skills,” she said. “We’re not looking for a pastor or a perfect person and as Christians, we all know that we’re all works of progress.” Clinton is a Methodist and has spoken about how her youth minister got her involved in public service. Trump has questioned whether his Democratic rival really is Christian.Joseph Guagliardi, a student at Liberty University, admitted that Trump didn’t display Christian values. “As far as Christian values go, I’m not really sure where he’s at with that, but basically for me, I’m just seeing more of His values in him than I do in Hillary,” he added.Forgiving Trump is something that Christianity encourages, Nancy Elliott said.“The great thing about Christianity, it’s about forgiveness and when a person recognizes that the path they’re on is wrong, has been wrong, they change that direction and I think God forgives them and I think we have to too,” she said. Elliott added that she was fine with Trump’s bragging about constructing the most beautiful hotels and buildings because “that’s probably just truth. Is there a problem telling truth?”But it’s not clear how much exactly the businessman wants to be forgiven. Asked last year if he had ever asked God for forgiveness, Trump said he wasn’t sure if he had.“I just go on and try to do a better job from there,” Trump told Frank Luntz last year. “If I do something wrong, I think, I just try and make it right. I don’t bring God into that picture. I don’t.” Trump did recently say on the campaign trail that he had regrets, but declined to get into specifics.While attendees were willing to give Trump’s faith the benefit of the doubt when it came to his religion, they applied a different standard to President Barack Obama, whom they said didn’t act like he was a Christian.“I do not believe he’s shown signs of Christianity. He is so in the tank with Planned Parenthood that kills babies, I find it hard to believe that is very inconsistent, murder babies. I don’t see the fruits of Christianity in him,” Elliott said. “He may be, I hope he is. I have no ill towards the man, but he doesn’t show the roots of a believer.” Asked whether Obama is a Muslim, as Trump has suggested, Elliott said she didn’t know. “He states he is, but we look at people by the fruit that they portray,” Pezdek said. “So, I’m still looking for the fruit that bears that statement out.” The GOP nominee shares in his 2004 book, Trump: Think Like a Billionaire: Everything You Need to Know About Success, Real Estate, and Life, some of his thoughts on God using descriptive language that is unmistakably Trumpian.“I do not think I am God. I believe in God. If God ever wanted an apartment in Trump Tower, I would immediately offer my best luxury suite at a very special price,” he writes. “I believe God is everywhere and in all of us, and I want every decision I make to reflect well on me when it’s time to go to the big boardroom in the sky. When I get permanently fired by the ultimate boss, I want the elevator to go up, not down.”To Samuel Stover, the passage from Trump’s book shows a misunderstanding of God. “I definitely think he lacks the perception of how powerful God is in some ways,” Stover said. “You know that he’s just somebody that we’re offering, oh you can have a suite. But he’s someone we offer our lives to and as a Christian, that’s what we choose to do. It’s a life commitment.” Still, he said, Trump had a point.“If an apartment suite is the best that I have for God, then that’s what I’d like to give him.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

I have no ill towards the man, but he doesn’t show the roots of a believer.” Asked whether Obama is a Muslim, as Trump has suggested, Elliott said she didn’t know. “He states he is, but we look at people by the fruit that they portray,” Pezdek said. “So, I’m still looking for the fruit that bears that statement out.” The GOP nominee shares in his 2004 book, Trump: Think Like a Billionaire: Everything You Need to Know About Success, Real Estate, and Life, some of his thoughts on God using descriptive language that is unmistakably Trumpian.“I do not think I am God. I believe in God. If God ever wanted an apartment in Trump Tower, I would immediately offer my best luxury suite at a very special price,” he writes. “I believe God is everywhere and in all of us, and I want every decision I make to reflect well on me when it’s time to go to the big boardroom in the sky. When I get permanently fired by the ultimate boss, I want the elevator to go up, not down.”To Samuel Stover, the passage from Trump’s book shows a misunderstanding of God. “I definitely think he lacks the perception of how powerful God is in some ways,” Stover said. “You know that he’s just somebody that we’re offering, oh you can have a suite. But he’s someone we offer our lives to and as a Christian, that’s what we choose to do. It’s a life commitment.” Still, he said, Trump had a point.“If an apartment suite is the best that I have for God, then that’s what I’d like to give him.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Chief among their concerns is Trump’s seemingly unwavering support for Putin, who the two argue has “repeatedly shown himself to be an adversary of the United States.”“Putin, during his long tenure, has repeatedly pursued policies that undermine U.S. interests and those of our allies and partners,” Vickers and Morell said. “He has steadily but systematically moved Russia from a fledgling democratic state to an authoritarian one. He is the last foreign leader you should be praising.”The editorial comes after Wednesday night’s debacle of a forum, where Trump said he would keep saying “great things” the Russian president as long as Putin continues to compliment him.“I’ve already said, he is really very much of a leader,” Trump said of Putin. “I mean, you can say, ‘Oh, isn’t that a terrible thing’ ― the man has very strong control over a country.” But “control over a country” has been at the expense of the Russian people themselves, Morell and Vickers argued. At home, Putin has jailed and killed political opponents. He has jailed and killed journalists. He has neutered the Russian media to the point that he is in complete control of the message reaching the Russian people. He has the popularity that you so admire only because he determines what the Russian people hear about him and his government.

Lady Gaga surprised a room full of East London clubgoers with a live performance in a shiny crop top early Saturday, just hours after dropping her upcoming album’s first single, “Perfect Illusion.”Guests of the Moth Club heard Gaga perform the new song and some old favorites including 2009’s “Bad Romance,” along with other pop hits.The Daily Telegraph reports that Gaga’s producer, Mark Ronson, warmed up for her performance with a DJ set before the singer took the stage around 1:30 a.m.The upcoming, unnamed album ― a more “analog” production that will feature Florence Welch on one track ― is Gaga’s first solo endeavor since her 2013 album “Artpop.” In the meantime, she worked on a collaboration with jazz singer Tony Bennett and released the Oscar-nominated song “’Till It Happens to You.” Gaga has also been keeping busy with acting gigs.In January, she took home a Golden Globe for her work in FX’s anthology series “American Horror Story,” having played the Countess in Season 5, “Hotel,” and is set to appear in Season 6 of the horror show, premiering Wednesday. (Details of the upcoming season are frustratingly scarce.) Gaga’s role alongside Bradley Cooper in the upcoming “reimagining” of the oft-remade film “A Star Is Born” was announced in August; she’s been spotted hanging out with the actor in Malibu, California. The singer ended her engagement with fiancé Taylor Kinney in July.A release date for Gaga’s new album has not yet been announced.CORRECTION: Gaga’s song “Bad Romance” was released in 2009, not 2008.

My loving parents moved from Pakistan to America to establish a better life for their children. Being the first born child and the first born in America, I had to spend a fair amount of time synchronizing and compartmentalizing what I learned in school and television and what I was immersed in at home. Like Naz, I found (and find) myself frequently tight-roping the line of balance between my American identity, my Muslim identity, and my Pakistani identity simultaneously trying to “fit in” and be cool. I can remember many times in college where I found myself in precarious situations, that didn’t “feel right” but attempting to fit in or avoid experiencing FOMO (fear of missing out). So it’s not surprising how much I identify with the character of Naz. HBO’s “The Night of”” came across as an accurate portrayal of the Pakistani American Muslim experience. Nasir (Naz) Khan is a young college student from a traditional Pakistani family in Jackson Heights who just by taking a few bad steps, ends up in one of the nation’s most dangerous correctional institutions, Rikers Island. I wonder what I would have done if I was in Naz’s shoes. If I was an honor student, wanting to be on the basketball team and one of the players asks me to come to a “cool party,” would I have gone? If my father was a taxi-driver and I didn’t have a car, would I have taken my father’s taxi? If an attractive woman was interested in hanging out with me, would I have given her a ride? Far removed from early adulthood, I would now hope that in these situations I wouldn’t have engaged in the risk–taking behaviors that went on in the show that evening, but would I be honest to say that I wouldn’t be as impressionable as Naz when I was a 20-year old college student?The show highlights many of the stereotypes of Muslims and Arabs in the show. From the beginning, Nasir is called “Towel-head,” “Mustafa,” said to have been carrying “bombs,” “running away from DHS,” “Muslim freak,” etc. He apparently had been involved in two Islamophobia-related altercations at school after 9/11 that got him kicked off the basketball team and forced a transfer to a different school. As a result of his intensely public trial, hate crimes against “Arab looking” cab drivers increased, swastikas, crosses, and “Muslims go home” signs were written with graffiti over the walls.Internally within the Muslim and Pakistani community, Nasir was seen throughout the series with fear and suspicion, so much so that his family apparently was considering moving, obviously for safety and the trauma, but additionally because of the “community shame” that had been unjustly placed upon them stemming from of the Islamophobic rhetoric and corrupt justice system against people of color. Perhaps even deeper was the concept of “desi guilt” in the movies. Desi meaning people who originate and identify from the South-Asian region. The desi culture is built upon “duty,” and one of the duties is to serve and honor one’s family. As a first born son like Nasir, I take great pride and care in protecting the honor of my family and serving them righteously. In multiple scenes, Naz is looking to his parents with a look of shame, fearing that they will judge him. He consistently yields to their advice and expertise as his parents and elders: as to which lawyer to take or which clothes to wear in court. His father was supportive throughout the series. However, one of the sadder realities of the series was the relationship of Naz and his mother. As the trial progresses and even after the trial had concluded, Naz’s mother begins to doubt her son’s innocence and he eventually confronts her about it, thus straining the relationship even more. Perhaps even more troubling, is the slim probability of the reconciliation between the two.The transformation of Naz in prison was also frightening. I honestly can’t blame Naz for all of the risk-taking behavior he had to partake in in prison because I don’t know what any of us would do in that situation to survive. The problem is that what happened in prison would probably have a drastic effect on his mental health. Currently, there is still a strong stigma attached with mental health and the Muslim community and if his story was true, I doubt he would have sought or had the resources for the proper care that he and his family needed to move on from this traumatic experience. The eccentric and dichotomous friendship with fellow inmate Freddy, in one way corrupts Naz to another level, but also protects him and grooms to survive in the “real world.” The two grew so close that Freddie left a book for Naz instead of being able to say good-bye to him and in turn you see Naz staring and having tears as he leaves his friend forever.Two more refreshing relationships were with his attorney Stone who trusts him and supports him from the beginning even for free when he wasn’t technically his lawyer anymore. And of course Chandra his other attorney, who became emotionally compromised, but was still supportive and was a testament to positive Indian-Pakistani relations that South-Asians experience here in the U.S. These relationships were refreshing and reaffirming of the greatness of our country to do what’s right even in these intense times of prejudice and Islamophobia. As a Muslim chaplain and university professional now, I find myself reflecting on how best to create a community and environment where my students, faculty, and staff look to me for guidance and to enable safe-spaces to explore their identity in healthy ways, to not feel enticed to walk into tumultuous situations that could affect their lives forever. We see how one instance of being in the “wrong place at the wrong time” can lead to a snowballing effect of disastrous consequences. The reason I entered into this field was to be a support-system for students like Naz and guide them to a better path. How does one truly be Muslim, ethnicity (x) and American at the same time? Or rather we learn that the full identity is really an intersectionality of attributes. I can only pray that stories like Naz do not become a common reality, and that God protects and guides our collective youth."

They have created many happy memories in their house in Guilderland, a suburb of Albany, New York, and look forward to many more with their three young boys, twins who are three and a four-month-old baby. But an aggressive and homophobic neighbor is infringing on their dreams and causing the family undue concern about their safety.Following the heinous attack at Pulse Nightclub in Orlando this past June, in which dozens of LGBT people were murdered by a lone gunman, Melinda and Kelly erected a rainbow flag outside their home on an otherwise quiet suburban street in a show of solidarity and mourning.They didn’t think anything of it and in fact some neighbors even showed their support. “We have had two or three neighbors stop by and say they like our flag,” Melinda relayed.But their next door neighbor, an older couple, took issue with the LGBT pride symbol. They immediately put up “No trespassing” signs in the backyard along the border that separated their yard from the Person’s.Melinda took offense but kept an optimistic outlook. She knocked on their front door in the hopes of clarifying. “I asked them if they would take the signs down, apologized for whatever we may have done to offend them and asked if we could start over and try to get along,” she said.They called the police on her for trespassing. Still, Melinda tried further de-escalating techniques. She wrote them a letter but they never responded.They tried to ignore the neighbors from that point on, but they were warned by others in the neighborhood that the couple was crazy and they should be aware.Sure enough, the couple’s antics didn’t stop. On their sons’ third birthday this August, Melinda and Kelly held a little gathering in their yard. The next door neighbors, seemingly in an attempt to unnerve and disrupt the family celebration, rode two lawnmowers in circles around their adjacent yard the entire afternoon.And then, just one day ago, the neighbors defaced their trees and spray painted “Trump” on two trees in the backyard facing the Person’s home.“I think Trump has given closeted bigots a sense of empowerment and they now feel the freedom to express their hate,” Melinda relayed. The Person’s do not have any political signage anywhere on their property. “It’s unfortunate that this is the way they chose to spend their time and energy. We moved to Guilderland because Melinda grew up here and knew it to be a friendly, nice community. These neighbors are the exception, not the rule,” said Kelly.Melinda and Kelly aren’t sure what other steps they may take, but are considering putting a fence up, something they’d rather not do because of the expense and because they would prefer to just get along with their neighbors.“Our three-year-old twins ask questions about what the signs are for. We say our neighbors aren’t very nice,” Melinda said.“I’m sad that my kids have to grow up next to this hate,” Kelly added.Melinda and Kelly have been together since 2011. They married in 2014 and welcomed two adorable twin boys into the world. Melinda works for a labor union and has been active in LGBTQ advocacy for many years, and was a member of the Board of Directors at the Empire State Pride Agenda, New York’s former LGBT advocacy organization. Her wife Kelly is a Navigator in the Air National Guard."

At the time, Trump did not disclose that the donations all came from him, and regulators did not identify the companies as being part of Trump’s real estate empire.The contributions included $500 from Trump himself; $500 from 40 Wall Street LLC, a company Trump controls; $500 from VH Property Corp DBA Trump National Golf Course, a Trump company that operates mainly in California; and $500 from Wollman Rink Operations LLC, a company Trump created to manage an ice skating rink in Manhattan’s Central Park.The four contributions were first identified by the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, a group supporting Trump’s rival, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Trump identified all three companies as under his control in his personal financial disclosure report to the Office of Government Ethics, filed in the summer of 2015. A spokeswoman for the Trump campaign did not immediately respond on Friday to questions from The Huffington Post. At the time of the gifts, Crist was a Republican, but in recent years the former governor has run as an Independent and as a Democrat. The donations from Trump appear to be the latest example of the Republican nominee using his maze of business interests and corporations to get around laws that limit how much one individual or company can donate to a particular political campaign. During the GOP primary campaign, Trump bragged about how he used campaign contributions to effectively buy political support for his business interests. “When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me,” Trump said.But Trump’s cavalier attitude towards election law has repeatedly gotten him into trouble with regulators, and sometimes resulted in serious fines. In the 1980s, Trump admitted to using his web of companies to contribute tens of thousands of dollars beyond the legal limit to the campaign of the chairman of the New York City Council. And in 1993, Trump paid a $15,000 fine to the Federal Election Commission for exceeding the legal limit of contributions to federal candidates. More recently, Trump has come under fire for using his tax-exempt nonprofit, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, to give $25,000 to a PAC supporting Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi’s reelection bid. Such donations violate nonprofit tax laws, and Trump was fined $2,500. The donation to Bondi was made during a short window of time in September of 2013 when Bondi’s office was deciding whether to investigate Trump University, the Republican nominee’s now-shuttered seminar program.Trump is facing lawsuits in multiple states alleging that the company defrauded customers. Bondi, however, decided not to pursue legal claims against Trump over Trump University.Trump later hosted a fundraiser for Bondi at his home in Palm Beach in March 2014. He held a similar fundraising event for Crist in June 2005 in Manhattan, helping to introduce the attorney general to wealthy New Yorkers.

If not now, when? ― Emma Watson,” a graphic posted by Trump’s account said. (It was also posted on Trump’s Facebook and Twitter accounts.) The saying ― which has been quoted and repurposed by many luminaries over the years ― is a variation of a quote attributed to Hillel the Elder, an important rabbinic authority from more than two millennia ago.Although its origins may not be widely known, many social media observers joked that Trump should know better, given that she converted to Orthodox Judaism before marrying her husband, Jared Kushner, in 2009.Watson, known for her role as Hermione in the “Harry Potter” film series, did say those words during a 2014 speech announcing a gender equality initiative at the United Nations. Hillel’s original quote is longer. “If I am not for myself, who is for me? And if I am only for myself, what am I? And if not now, when?” Hillel is quoted as saying in the tractate of the Mishnah known as “Ethics of the Fathers.” Of course, Trump most likely does not personally run her social media accounts. If anything, it is one of the tasks assigned to her army of unpaid interns.Donald Trump’s campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The incident is also notable because, in referencing Watson’s speech on gender equality, Ivanka continues to lend a veneer of female empowerment to her father’s presidential campaign, despite the elder Trump’s long history of misogynist comments.Some of Ivanka’s efforts to make her father’s candidacy more women-friendly have already backfired.

We will take care of them,” said Syed Mokbul Hossain, chair of Tampaco and a former member of parliament.“My company is fully compliant and I’ve never sacrificed on quality, as my clients are mainly multinational companies.”Tampaco’s website says its clients include several local companies and global brands including British American Tobacco and Nestle.Fire department officials initially identified the factory as a garment packaging plant, but later clarified that it packs food and cigarettes.The fire will further tarnish the industrial safety record of one of the world’s top garment exporters.In the Rana Plaza disaster, 1,135 mainly garment industry workers were killed when a building collapsed outside Dhaka.That sparked demands for greater safety in the country and put the onus on multinational companies sourcing clothing from Bangladesh to act.The disaster led to the creation of two international coalitions designed to help fund improvements to building and fire safety at thousands of garment factories across Bangladesh.“So far our focus was only on readymade garment factories, but now this disaster has opened our eyes to the fact that we should also focus on other factories,” Syed Ahmed, the head of the Department of Inspection for factories in Bangladesh, told Reuters.The latest incident comes weeks after over 100 people fell ill when they inhaled gas that leaked from a fertilizer plant in the town of Chittagong in southern Bangladesh.(Writing by Euan Rocha; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Clarence Fernandez)"

Columbus was no friend to First Americans.gen·o·cideIn the old days, the “Indian” problem was taken care of with disease, soldiers and guns. Presidential orders were signed, soldiers dispatched, bounties given to militia all with the singular purpose of killing Native Americans. It didn’t matter whether those natives were armed, unarmed, elderly, women or children.According to the government and the collective consensus, the only good Indian was a dead Indian.Any Native American who was able to survive the slaughters, diseases, internment, starvation and forced marches were relegated to reservations. Often these lands designated for reservations were not homelands nor extremely desirable lands.I wish I could say America has recognized its fault in practically wiping out an entire ethnic group. I wish I could say that amends have been made in ensuring that Natives have the best education, medical care and work opportunities in the country. I wish I could say that as a whole Native Americans are thriving. None of that rings true generations after Wounded Knee, The Long Walk or the Trail of Tears.For those of you who have never set foot on a reservation, I urge you to visit one and I don’t mean a casino. I mean the dirt poor areas where water doesn’t run freely from a tap. It has to be hauled in over a rutted dirt road. Electricity... perhaps if you are lucky or have a generator. Don’t even think about the luxury of wi-fi. Please excuse the suspicious nature of its inhabitants... they have reason for that.When I was a kid, I remember how many, many people were still living in shacks covered in tar paper. This wasn’t out in the middle of nowhere. This was in one of the bigger towns on the Navajo reservation. I went with my family down to Mexico once and marveled about how much it reminded me of the reservation. People there also lived in shacks that looked like they were built with found materials. Mexico was pretty close to third-world at that time.The reservation has changed some since then but not enough. I am ever the optimist but at times I feel resigned that it won’t change. Lately, I’m feeling that resignation dissipating with the events unfolding in South Dakota.It fills me with extreme pride to see so many tribes united in the cause that is the Standing Rock protest. Standing Rock isn’t just about oil. Standing Rock isn’t just about water. Standing Rock is a test. There is a roar coming from North Dakota. This is the moment you can choose to listen to that roar of our voices, to recognize that we are people, we belong here and our cause is valid.So far the mainstream media has chosen to be fairly silent in reference to Standing Rock. Apparently, spray tan and non-truths play and pay better than warpaint and ethics. Much has been done to try and silence the voices of protesters at the site. Of the mainstream coverage that has emerged sparingly, one network has painted them as violent anarchists using white biased coverage (CBS, I’m talking about you). Never mind those attack dogs set loose on a little girl. She’s not your little girl though, so why should you care?MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell has been one of very few to broach the subject and do so in a stellar manner.Some of you might be offended by my characterization of America and feel like this doesn’t represent you. If that is the case, then I challenge you. I challenge you to do something! Recognize it, talk about it, and share it! Sign a petition, attend a protest, challenge your lawmakers, donate to the cause. Turning a blind eye or worse yet assuming it’ll work itself out only perpetuates the notion that Native Americans aren’t human, don’t belong here and should cease to exist altogether.A version of this post originally appeared on SurlyBird.wordpress.com."
40,POLITICS,"Yes, Conservatives Are Still Questioning Whether President Obama Is Really A Christian",Sam Levine and Christine Conetta,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/barack-obama-christian-conservatives_us_57d446dee4b00642712dd499,"“There’s a lot of public, media stuff that says he’s not.""",2016-09-10,Several attendees at the Values Voter Summit said they don't think President Barack Obama is Christian.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d44bbd1800006c32bd0946.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― It was a yes-or-no question that shouldn’t have been hard to answer: Is President Barack Obama a Christian?Donald Trump has fueled speculation that Obama might be Muslim since 2011, when he questioned whether the president was really born in Hawaii. Obama eventually released his birth certificate, but the GOP presidential nominee still refuses to disavow so-called “birthers.”Still, the absurd conspiracy theory seemed to be an old story ― one that has been debunked so many times and that Obama himself has made fun of. But several people The Huffington Post asked Friday about Obama’s faith at the annual Values Voter Summit, a conference for religious conservatives, showed that Trump has very much succeeded in raising questions about the president’s religion.“I do question it, I really do,” said Linda Roller, referring to Obama’s Christianity. “One of the latest things I saw was even a symbol with his hand that was similar to a Muslim saying Allah is the only God.”Roller went on to say that she didn’t think Obama was Christian because he didn’t share her beliefs.“I mean just the fact that he is very liberal and the fact that he believes in abortion for instance,” she said. “And that he believes in a lot things that I don’t believe in because I try to use the Bible as my guide.” Several people echoed Roller. Many believed that even though Obama said he was Christian, his actions, particularly support for pro-abortion rights and for Planned Parenthood, suggested otherwise.“He states he is, but we look at people by the fruit that they portray,” Heidi Pezdek said. “What I’m looking at is his stand for abortion and support for Planned Parenthood, which is murder, murder in the womb, and his strong support of the LGBT lifestyle community.”Nancy Elliott said she didn’t believe he’s shown signs of Christianity. “He is so in the tank with Planned Parenthood that kills babies,” she said. “I don’t see the fruits of Christianity in him. He may be, I hope he is. I have no ill towards the man, but he doesn’t show the roots of a believer.” When asked whether she thought Obama was a Muslim, Elliott replied, “I don’t know. They say he was raised as a Muslim.”A CNN/ORC poll from last September showed that just 39 percent of Americans think Obama is a Christian. Twenty-nine percent of those surveyed said they think he is a Muslim.“I’m not too sure,” Values Voter Summit attendee Joseph Guagliardi said. “While he does claim to be a Christian, I’m not sure how you can be for abortion and be a Christian because as Christians we believe in pro-life.” Joe Tegerdine said actions were more important than stated beliefs when it came to Christianity.“If you look at somebody’s policies and the way they behave and the way they act, it speaks more about your Christianity than what you say. So I take what Obama says literally at face value, but I take what he does to heart,” he said. “I think he’s proven through his behavior that he may not be as Christian as he may claim.”Obama has spoken extensively about his Christian faith on several occasions.“For me, and I know for so many of you, faith is the great cure for fear,” he said at the National Prayer Breakfast this year. “Jesus is a good cure for fear. God gives believers the power, the love, the sound mind required to conquer any fear.” The president said in 2006 that an attack suggesting he wasn’t a “true Christian” during his race for a U.S. Senate seat in Illinois “nagged” at him. Obama has said that while he was not raised in a particularly religious household, he found the power of Christianity while working as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago.“Without a vessel for my beliefs, without a commitment to a particular community of faith, at some level I would always remain apart, and alone,” he said in 2006. “It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany. I didn’t fall out in church. The questions I had didn’t magically disappear. But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt that I heard God’s spirit beckoning me. I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth.” Obama left his church, Chicago’s Trinity United Church of Christ, in 2008 after comments of his pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, criticizing the United States emerged. Despite Obama’s references to his faith, Tristen Jimenez said he still hadn’t seen enough evidence that the president is a Christian.“I don’t know enough facts to answer that yes or no, there’s a lot of public, media stuff that says he’s not. At the end of the day, I don’t know,” Jimenez said. “I want to say [he is] just because he is our president and you want to have trust and faith in that, but you know, I don’t know his heart; I don’t know what’s in his head.” Asked whether Obama is Muslim, Jimenez said “he could be anything.”While attendees at the Values Voter Summit didn’t hesitate to question Obama’s faith, they seemed more than willing to take Trump at his word that he was a Christian, despite constant boasting from the GOP nominee about his sexual promiscuity, lies and other unchristian actions.When Roller, the woman who questioned Obama’s faith because of something he did with his hands, noted that she didn’t know what church the president went to or who his pastor was, the HuffPost asked if she knew what church Trump attended.“No I do not,” she said."
41,POLITICS,Maker Of Dangerous Opioid Is Spending Big To Stop Legal Pot In Arizona,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dangerous-opioid-maker-spending-big-to-stop-arizona-legalization_us_57d45eb2e4b06a74c9f50515,Insys Therapeutics has been accused of illegally marketing its oral spray of fentanyl.,2016-09-10,Law enforcement officials in Arizona process marijuana seized from Mexico. Would legal pot reduce imports from Mexico?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d4613c1300002a0039b286.jpeg?cache=RX8aErM3Ii&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A controversial pharmaceutical company that makes a highly addictive opioid donated $500,000 to a campaign fighting a ballot measure in Arizona that would legalize recreational marijuana.Proponents of the measure, Proposition 205, see Insys Therapeutics, the company behind the major contribution, as emblematic of the way the makers of dangerous painkillers block legalization efforts to pad their own profit margins. Marijuana is a cheaper and safer alternative to drugs that the likes of Insys sell, the advocates argue.“We are truly shocked by our opponents’ decision to keep a donation from what appears to be one of the more unscrupulous members of Big Pharma,” said J.P. Holyoak, chair of the Campaign to Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, in a statement. “You have a company using profits from the sale of what has been called ‘the most potent and dangerous opioid on the market’ to prevent adults from using a far less harmful substance.”Insys currently only markets Subsys, an oral spray form of fentanyl, a powerful painkiller linked to the opioid epidemic, according to its most recent filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Arizona-based firm is also developing a synthetic cannabis product, which it said would improve on a product it sold in the past, but has discontinued.The company has endured multiple investigations in recent years for allegedly illegal marketing of Subsys. The state of Illinois sued the company in August, arguing that Insys had marketed the drug to physicians for “off-label” uses, meaning those not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.California, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Arizona and Oregon have also investigated the company’s sales tactics.The scrutiny has corresponded with a drop in revenue from Subsys. Insys’ net revenue went from $148 million in the first half of 2015 to $129 million in the first half of 2016, according to its SEC filing. The drop was “attributable” to a 27.7 percent decrease in Subsys sales, which the company partly offset through price increases.The accusations are particularly problematic, because of the risks associated with the abuse of fentanyl-based drugs like Subsys. As Holyoak notes in his statement, Dr. Andrew Kolodny, executive director of Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, told CNBC that fentanyl is “the most potent and dangerous opioids on the market.”The United States is in the midst of a deadly opioid epidemic. More than 28,000 Americans died from opioid overdoses in 2014 ― the most on record ― according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Opioids include illegal drugs such as heroin, but the largest increase in overdose deaths from 2013 to 2014 was due to synthetic opioids like fentanyl.Some reports indicate that fentanyl has grown in prominence after the demise of OxyContin, an opioid released by Purdue in the 1990s. (Purdue’s aggressive marketing of OxyContin is blamed for enabling the overprescription and abuse that gave rise to the current opioid crisis.)The celebrated musician Prince, who died at age 57 in April, is perhaps the most famous person to overdose on fentanyl.Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy, the political action committee opposing Prop. 205 that received the donation from Insys, enjoys the backing of top Arizona lawmakers in the state, including Gov. Doug Ducey (R). Insys is the first donor the group lists in a line at the bottom of the site acknowledging the sources of its “major funding.” The other backers Arizonans for Responsible Drug Policy publicizes are the Arizona Chamber of Commerce & Industry, Empire Southwest LLC, and Pima Medical Institute. The Arizona Chamber and Empire Southwest each contributed $50,000 to ARDP, and Pima gave $40,000 in the 12-month period ending in August, according to the latest campaign finance report.Adam Deguire, the group’s campaign manager and a former chief of staff to Arizona Rep. Matt Salmon (R), told the U.S. News & World Report that ARDP would not be returning Insys’ donation. Insys is based in Arizona, whereas the Marijuana Policy Project, a pro-legalization group, is based in Washington, D.C., Deguire noted.Barrett Marson, communications director of Regulate Marijuana Like Alcohol, said location is less important than motive in this case.“Obviously Insys isn’t concerned about prohibition of marijuana, it is concerned about profits,” Marson said.Registered voters in Arizona favored passing Prop. 205 by a 10-point margin as of the end of August, according to an Arizona Republic poll.Medical marijuana has been legal in Arizona since 2010, but criminal penalties for its recreational use remain heavy.The federal government still classifies marijuana as a “Schedule I” drug, a category it reserves for the most dangerous and addictive substances that have no acceptable medical use."

Thirty-three ultimately died, The Boston Herald reported.“When I arrived, birds would fly, like from a house to a tree, they would flop in the tree and they would fall to the ground,” Lt. Alan Borgal of the Animal Rescue League of Boston told New England Cable News. “The weaker ones were just falling right out the sky.”Local resident Shelora Levaud told CBS Boston that it seemed as if the birds were paralyzed on one side.“I tried to move them a little bit, and it just seemed like they were on one side, and you put them on their feet and they just fell,” she said.And the birds weren’t the only victims. Willien Pugh found his beloved cat, Sally B, dying at his doorstep at around 8:30 that morning. NECN reports that a second cat in the area also died suddenly, while a third was “affected.”Investigators are trying to determine whether the deaths were the result of disease, poison or some other cause."
