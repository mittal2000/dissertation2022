While Instagram updates can make anyone feel as though they're in on the Hollywood secrets for red-carpet perfection, there are untold tricks that makeup artists keep up their sleeves for those moments when nothing can be left to chance. I spilled some of my favorite tips on E! this week and I want to let you in on my top ten most unusual tips for a flawless face from lips to lashes.    Gwyneth Paltrow and P. Diddy prep for the red carpet1. DIY Lash Perm The eyes have it when you're flashing the paps with your best blue steel. To really open the eyes and make lashes look as long and thick as possible, always curl your lashes before applying mascara. If you give your curler a quick blast with a hair dryer beforehand, the heat will give lashes a boost to keep the curl in place through any after party.   Charlize Theron2. An Alluring 3D Lip  Before Angelina Jolie's leg took on a life of its own her lips were the main awards season attraction. Fake a full 3D pout in three foolproof steps: first brush a white, matte gel eyeliner on the lip line and over the lip. Create depth by adding a neutral shade of cream lipstick to the center of the mouth, and then top with a matching gloss. The different textures create a very full-looking, 3D pout destined for social media stardom.  Angelina Jolie3. The Ultimate Feline Flick Winged statement liner has been an Oscars mainstay since Barbra Streisand reigned over the red carpet with a teased bob and cat-eye liner in 1969. To build intensity with liner apply scotch tape from the corner of the eye angled toward the temple to map out the shape of your line. Apply your design then remove the tape to reveal perfectly clean and crisp lines worthy of a makeup pro.   Emma Stone4. A Mess-Free Smoky Eye The area under the eyes can make or break a look when it comes to appearing fresh and well-rested. While oxygen facials and juice cleanses certainly don't hurt, I love to apply my energizing eye masks under the eyes while I'm creating a smoky eye. The masks reduce puffiness and discoloration while also keeping the area free of shadow fallout. Just make sure to conceal the under-eye area afterward!  Jennifer Lawrence5. An A-List Complexion. Blemishes are an unwanted accessory on any occasion, but they can be quickly remedied with a clever combination of products. Before you reach for your concealer, apply eye drops or a nasal spray over any blemishes. They both act a bit like a topical steroid, helping to shrink blood vessels and minimize redness.  Jessica Alba 6. Hair that Shimmers No matter how many hot oil treatments or serums you try, the hair of mere mortals never quite looks as shiny as, say, Amy Adams'. One of Hollywood's top hair pros says the reason lies in one his most trusted red carpet beauty secrets: ""I will take ultra-fine glitter powder and mix it with hair spray, then I'll use this mixture when styling."" The lights and cameras pick up the sparkle so viewers at home are left with major hair envy. Amy Adams 7. An Oscar-Worthy Glow Stars are subject to thousands of photos during a red carpet event. To give skin a scene-stealing glow, mix two drops of argan oil with foundation before applying. This trick helps to even out light reflecting from the skin, so it appears flawless in photos.  Kerry Washington 8. Bright Eyes You may have heard of putting frozen teaspoons on the eyes to take down puffiness, but there's an even easier trick for wide-awake eyes -- place an ice cube on your tongue and hold it to the roof of your mouth for ten minutes. This method results in eyes that look refreshed and bright. Reese Witherspoon9. A Full Fringe of Lashes Lush lashes are essential to define the eyes in photos and I absolutely adore a faux lash, but some women are uncomfortable wearing them. Here's the trick for getting natural lashes red carpet-ready: Coat the top of your lashes with a translucent powder followed by a generous amount of mascara on both the top and bottom of your lashes to pump up the volume. Adele10. Picture-Perfect Makeup The secret to keeping celebs' makeup looking matte, not caked, is to dip a makeup brush in moisturizer, removing the excess cream, and then dip it into powder before applying it to the skin. This offers coverage and shine control without giving skin the dreaded dry, powdery look. Sandra Bullock"

I had a sense that she was the closest I'd ever met to someone who I could see myself with. Pretty much right away.YourTango: How did you meet?Seth Meyers: I met her at Chris Kattan's wedding. Her sister worked in the set design department of ""SNL"".YourTango: Now you're even busier with ""Late Night"". How do you find time for her?Seth Meyers: My wife is a very smart woman, smarter than me. When I decided with her counsel to take this job, we both understood it's going to be pretty lousy six to nine months, and then it will be a lot better. Once I get in the swing of things, this is a far better job to be married than ""SNL"" was.YourTango: Do you share a similar sense of humor?Seth Meyers: Well, my wife is sillier than I am so that makes me laugh a great deal. I make her laugh, too. But I also make her not laugh and that's when I know it's time to retire something.YourTango: What's the secret to keeping your relationship solid?Seth Meyers: We just have to find time for one another. But you know, my wife works at the Brooklyn D.A.'s office. She's dealing in a far darker world than I am. And she manages to come home and still be bright-eyed and positive. So I have to do the same.YourTango: What little things does she do for you to show her love?Seth Meyers: It's funny, she used to be this incredible curator of all our memories and keep a scrapbook. Every time we went to the Emmy Awards, she would save the ticket. She'd get mad if I lost a name tag. And then after the Golden Globes, I asked if she wanted to save the tickets and she said, ""No, I'm done with that.""More Stories From YourTango: Tori Spelling: 'The Ghost Of Farrah Fawcett Came To Me!'

Most respondents gave answers that make us feel optimistic about American classrooms. According to the survey, an overwhelming majority of teachers said their top reasons for going into education were ""to make a difference in children's lives,"" ""to share my love of learning and teaching"" and ""to help students reach their full potential."" Barely any said they went into teaching ""for the earning potential"" or for ""no particular reason."" We only wish everyone had such positive reasons for choosing a profession.

4,PARENTING,"Thanks, Mrs. Obama, for What You've Done for Our Kids","Today's Mama, Contributor
Changing diapers, minds and habits, sometimes all in one day",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thanks-mrs-obama_us_5b9de5f6e4b03a1dcc8e594c,"If the government had not intervened in the matter of our children's health, I'm not sure we'd all be high-fiving each other about these latest statistics affecting our country's most precious resources.",2014-02-26,"MIAMI, FL - FEBRUARY 25: First Lady Michelle Obama and Mario Lopez dance in a Zumba class along with children during a visit to the Gwen Cherry Park NFL/YET Center as she celebrates the 4th Anniversary of Let's Move on February 25, 2014 in Miami, Florida. (Photo by Larry Marano/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9de5f63c00004c000a531b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Ana ConneryA couple of years ago, I was invited to the White House to interview First Lady Michelle Obama about the health of our children and her Let's Move campaign aimed at reducing childhood obesity. At the time, I was editor-in-chief of Parenting magazine, and to say I was honored to meet her and nervous about interviewing her are both complete understatements.To my pleasant surprise, Mrs. Obama was sincere, thoughtful and incredibly vivacious, and she put me right at ease. We talked about her childhood in Chicago and the nightly family dinners she enjoyed with her parents and brother inside their South Side apartment. She told me how pizza and fast food were occasional treats and that the only time her family really went out for dinner was when they were celebrating a great report card.Then we talked about the kids, our kids, as in every single American child, and how the world today prompts us to eat more and exercise less, leaving children vulnerable to a lifetime of health problems and a lack of both energy and self-confidence. She wanted every child to have the same healthy experience she'd had, but she knew that it was not only not happening, it was downright impossible for so many families. Fresh food has long been scarce in schools and in many communities, and finding the time, let alone the energy, to exercise with our kids was almost laughable to many exhausted Americans expected to work longer hours than most developed nations. Her voice rose slightly when she talked about the scary statistics regarding the future of our children's health, her hands moving in front of her chest as she strove to make her point. This was a woman committed to spending her time in the White House finding solutions.Yesterday, a study in the Journal of the American Medical Association announced there has been a 43 percent decline in obesity rates among 2- and 5-year-olds over the past decade. While we can't place the credit for this good news squarely on the shoulders of the First Lady, I think she deserves a lot of credit. She tackled one of the biggest problems facing our country -- and our kids in particular -- and for the first time in history, there is light to look forward to, at least partly thanks to her.Yesterday, Mrs. Obama also announced new limits on the types of foods that can be marketed to kids in schools. This comes on the heels of many more programs and initiatives, such as the Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, that provided schools with more subsidized meals and gave school officials a chance at reducing the costs of serving fruits and vegetables. Even the USDA has taken action in recent years, replacing the staid Food Pyramid with something called MyPlate, which emphasizes filling half the plate with healthy produce, and a quarter each of lean protein and whole grains. But the USDA didn't stop there. It also pushed schools to offer more fresh foods and reduce the amounts of fat and sodium offered to kids.I'm often struck by critics who say the government should butt out of our lives and leave us alone. If the government had not intervened in the matter of our children's health, I'm not sure we'd all be high-fiving each other about these latest statistics affecting our country's most precious resources. America is a coveted democracy where the individual and the government can come together to find solutions to our problems. Every once in a while when we let that happen, magic happens, and our kids' lives are better for it.I don't know about you, but that makes me want to get up and move."
