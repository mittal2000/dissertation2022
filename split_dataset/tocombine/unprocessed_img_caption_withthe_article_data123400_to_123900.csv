It was the day of Boston marathon, and we were prepared for the usual influx of people with heatstroke and dehydration. That day, as other days, we also treated dozens of critically ill patients with heart attacks, strokes, and severe infectionsJust before 3 p.m., we received the call that nobody could have predicted. Bombs had detonated at the Boston marathon. Many people were gravely injured.Minutes later, they arrived in our ER. Some were not breathing. Others were missing limbs. All were covered with blood and soot. As an emergency physician, I am trained to treat traumatic injuries. But while I helped direct our trauma teams to triage then resuscitate these patients, I was terrified. My husband and I lived in Back Bay, next to the explosions. He had texted me not long before to say that he was headed to the finish line to watch the marathon. I didn't know where he was; I feared that the next patient I took care of could be him. I wrote about this fear and guilt, and subsequently about the need to care for the many health care providers who served on that day.Now, one year later, I no longer live in Boston, but I will always remember April 15. I remember the bravery and resourcefulness of the first responder, bystanders, and volunteers. I remember the teamwork in our hospital among every service -- not just those of us caring for the victims themselves, but also those oncologists and obstetricians who jumped in and provided excellent care for other patients in our ER. I remember the support from our city and indeed our broader community in the U.S. and around the world. Most of all, I remember the courage of the victims and their families. Their resilience serves as inspiration for all of us.As I think back to April 15, 2013, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to take care of these brave men, women, and children. I'm honored to be able to serve and proud to be a physician and emergency care provider."

I've had the pleasure of staying at home with my children and working outside the home, but I have always been a ""working mom"" -- after all, a mom works 24/7. Each situation carries with it a set of unique circumstances, but the solutions for a mom to be healthy are the same.My top takeaways from my experiences as a ""working mom"" are listed as helpful solutions for you. As a mother, it is important to take necessary steps to ensure that you don't feel guilty about your career choices or suffer from anxiety overload. Doing this is crucial to creating space for your health and your family's health.1. Focus on Being Present  Whether you choose to work at home or at the office, the most important thing is to focus on being present. Your children and family will benefit from your quality time over quantity time -- every time. This is a hard one, but if you use the systems below it becomes much easier. 2. Transition Between the Office and Home Whatever works for you, do it! Maybe it's a drive, a coffee or a visit with a friend but try to transition between work and home mode. You will feel more connected, far less strained and your children will thank you.3. Hire a Housekeeper If a clean house makes everything in your world better, why wouldn't you take care of yourself and your family by hiring a housekeeper? You can take your children on an adventure to do something fun outdoors, teach them a new skill and come home to a tidy house. You will no longer feel pressured to do both while feeling unfulfilled because neither one received your full attention. It will also create space for you to enjoy your children.4. Find a Granny Nanny  While I was exploring the options of hiring someone to assist me with my children, I decided that I wanted my girls to have a granny nanny. Someone semi-retired that didn't have family close by that could be nurturing while I was at the office. This way they could bake, read, do homework and be exposed to multi-generational systems and ideas. This is a great option if you work at home and want to get out of the house. This will allow you the freedom to run your errands or take some personal time while your children are home baking cookies,  do some gardening, get help with homework. 5. Hire a Personal Assistant  This one is my personal favorite. When my daughters were 14 and 8, I hired a law student. The interviewing process was intense because I was looking for someone who could love my girls while doing tasks with them that needed to be done. Ashley would pick up the girls up from school, take them to the park, teach them new skills, prepare healthy meals with them and enforce rules like cleaning their rooms, respecting others and practicing violin. I would text her my list of tasks before she picked up the girls from school, then they were off -- laughing and giggling while taking care of family business. This was healthy for all of us and we added a new family member. The girls had a new big sister figure, Ashley made some cash and when I came home, I was able to enjoy the girls without feeling anxious about tasks that needed to be done. But she is on to them -- not letting them get away with too much and setting boundaries because she loves them. She is my right-hand lady and friend.6. Schedule Your Personal Time As Appointments It took some time for me to figure this one out. Your personal time is important -- critical to your family's health. Personal time may mean getting your nails done, visiting a friend, sitting by yourself or running around for the family, but it's all important. Schedule these events as appointments and encourage your family to do the same. Sometimes as parents, we can be easily convinced that our personal appointments aren't as serious as what is going on in our children's lives.The ROI on Moms' Health When I was looking at the associated cost of hiring help, I had a hard time justifying it. After a very short time (two days), I realized I couldn't afford not to. Take it from me -- it took 15 years of raising children and the pressures of juggling it all to realize that these are the solutions to every mother's mental health!As mothers, we want to give our children our time and the best versions of ourselves. These are ways you can do that. These tips will take some research, planning and budgeting, but once they are in place you will never look back.* I may be speaking to moms but this can apply to dads as well. Mother's Day is coming up - what a great gift idea!"

3,PARENTING,Jenny McCarthy Claims She Is 'Pro-Vaccine' In Sun-Times Op-Ed,Joseph Erbentraut,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jenny-mccarthy-vaccine_us_5b9dfbeae4b03a1dcc8fe6a2,"Former doctor Andrew Wakefield attempted to connect vaccinations and autism in a 1998 paper that was found to be ""an elaborate",2014-04-14,"NEW YORK, NY - APRIL 11: TV Jenny McCarthy Hostattends the Vemma Renew launch>> at The Loft at the Bryant Park Hotel on April 11, 2014 in New York City. (Photo by Steve Zak Photography/FilmMagic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dfbea240000320053cd02.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Noted anti-vaccination advocate Jenny McCarthy is describing herself as ""pro-vaccine"" now.McCarthy, ""The View"" co-host who has campaigned against vaccinations due to a widely discredited alleged link to autism, claimed in a Saturday op-ed in the Chicago Sun-Times that she has been ""wrongly branded"" for years when it comes to her position on the matter.In the column, McCarthy said she's been labeled as ""anti-vaccine"" due to ""blatantly inaccurate blog posts about my position"" that were ""accepted as truth by the public at large as well as media outlets (legitimate and otherwise), who have taken those false stories and repeatedly turned them into headlines.""""This is not a change in my stance nor is it a new position that I have recently adopted,"" she continued. However, her column still left room for the idea that vaccines are dangerous, and McCarthy wrote that she agreed with a blogger who described being in a ""gray zone"" when it comes to believing vaccines are completely safe for children.In the op-ed, McCarthy referenced a 2009 interview with Time magazine's Jeffrey Kluger, in which she also denied that she was trying to eliminate vaccines. In that interview, McCarthy said she was actually ""demanding safe vaccines"" and working to ""reduce the schedule and reduce the toxins.""Kluger, however, pointed out in an open letter published Saturday that McCarthy left several key quotations from the 2009 Time story out of her Sun-Times missive -- including ""if you ask a parent of an autistic child if they want the measles or the autism, we will stand in line for the f--king measles.""Kluger characterized McCarthy's op-ed as an attempt to ""whitewash her anti-vaccine stand:""Jenny, as outbreaks of measles, mumps and whooping cough continue to appear in the U.S.—most the result of parents refusing to vaccinate their children because of the scare stories passed around by anti-vaxxers like you—it’s just too late to play cute with the things you’ve said. You are either floridly, loudly, uninformedly antivaccine or you are the most grievously misunderstood celebrity of the modern era.McCarthy's Saturday column was published despite Susanna Negovan, the Sun-Times ""Splash"" publisher and editor, promising when McCarthy was first brought on as a blogger for the publication that she would not ""be writing about vaccines or giving medical advice.""Former doctor Andrew Wakefield attempted to connect vaccinations and autism in a 1998 paper that was found to be ""an elaborate fraud"" by the British Medical Journal. Wakefield's medical license was subsequently revoked. The idea of a link has also been discredited by scientific studies.A recent study found that efforts by public health groups to counter the myth that there's a link between vaccines and autism could actually be backfiring and leading more parents to choose not to vaccinate their children.Parents who are opting out of vaccination, public health officials say, are likely contributing to a resurgence of preventable diseases like the measles and whooping cough in the U.S.CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misstated the year Andrew Wakefield's fraudulent research was published. It was 1998, not 2008."
