Developers are planning a massive replica to be built in the emirate. Dubbed Taj Arabia, the billion-dollar replica will be four times larger than the original, and is being touted as a wedding destination. “Marriage is a celebration. It needs to be announced and glorified. Currently Dubai is not regarded as a wedding destination,"" Arun Mehra, chairman of the Link Global Group, sub-developers of the project, told gulfnews.com. ""People go to Bali and other exotic places to marry. Now they will come to Taj Arabia.""The complex will also contain a shopping center, a 300-room five-star hotel, serviced apartments and bridal wear stores, reports Gulf Daily News. Taj Arabia will be part of a larger complex called Falcon City of Wonders that will also be home to replicas of the Pyramids, the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Eiffel Tower, the Great Wall of China and the Leaning Tower of Pisa.According to The Independent, several Bollywood producers have already expressed interest in using Taj Arabia as a shooting location. Perhaps that's necessary considering the real Taj Mahal is in danger of collapsing. Many travelers won't find this development unusual, considering Dubai's penchant for quirky grandeur. A magazine spin-off Vogue Cafe is planned for the city's largest mall, which is already home to a giant aquarium. There's also that indoor ski resort and the Queen Elizabeth II cruse liner that's been turned into a hotel.And, lest we not forget, this is the city that gave us the notorious Crown Crust pizza. "

An outbreak of a rare and deadly form of fungal meningitis that has killed 4 people and sickened another 26 in five states is believed to have been traced back to a steroid manufactured by the New England Compounding Center. (AP Photo/Stephan Savoia)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c60572200005600d93642.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"UPDATED Oct. 8, 1:39 p.m.: Meningitis cases associated with the tainted steroids have risen to 105, the Associated Press reported, and the number of deaths has risen to eight. * * *UPDATED Oct. 7, 4:03 p.m.: The number of meningitis cases associated with the tainted steroid injections has risen to 91, Reuters reported. Seven people in total have died from the outbreak.* * * UPDATED Oct. 6, 11:23 p.m.: The number of deaths from the meningitis outbreak has risen to seven, UPI reported. The number of total cases of meningitis has risen to 64; nine states have cases of the outbreak (now including Minnesota and Ohio). * * *UPDATED Oct. 5, 3:47 p.m.: The number of people who have been sickened from meningitis has risen to 47 from the previously reported 39 (which includes five deaths), the Associated Press reported. The new cases come from Michigan, which is the seventh state to be affected by the outbreak. * * *Five people have died and 34 have fallen ill after being infected with a rare form of fungal meningitis, called aspergillus meningitis, from tainted steroid injections for back pain, according to news reports.ABC News reported that fungus was found in a vial of methylprednisolone acetate, which is the name of the steroid, produced by the New England Compounding Center in Massachusetts. Three lots of the steroid have since been recalled, the Associated Press reported. Patients in Tennessee, Indiana, Florida, North Carolina, Maryland and Virginia have developed meningitis from the tainted steroid injections, according to the AP. Seventy five clinics in 23 states that administered the steroid injections to patients are now warning of potential meningitis risk.So what exactly is aspergillus meningitis? Firstly, it's important to understand that there are several different kinds of meningitis; it can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, parasites, or ""non-infectious"" factors like cancer, surgery, drugs or injury. Some forms of meningitis are more dangerous -- and contagious -- than others. For example, viral meningitis is not as dangerous as bacterial meningitis, which requires immediate hospitalization, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Bacterial meningitis can be contagious, but it's usually not as easily transmissible as something like a cold or the flu, the CDC reported. Viral meningitis is also contagious, but fungal meningitis -- like aspergillus meningitis -- is not contagious from person to person. Aspergillus is ""around all of us, all the time,"" Dr. William Schaffner, president of the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases, told The Tennessean. ""It lives in vegetation and it particularly likes damp, moldy leaves, so it’s particularly pertinent this type of year."" Even though aspergillus isn't really known for making people sick, it is able to ""cause an illness in immunocompromised people,"" he added. The Associated Press reported that each year, aspergillus infections may only affect one to two people out of every 100,000.Meningitis itself is a condition where the tissues surrounding the brain and meninges (spinal cord) become inflamed, according to the CDC. Most cases of fungal meningitis come from breathing in spores from a yeast called Cryptococcus neoformans, but other fungi is able to cause the condition as well. Dr. Ben Park, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told NPR that while signs of other kinds of meningitis occur quickly, symptoms of fungal meningitis may be more slow to appear -- incubation time may be up to four weeks long. Symptoms may include headache, feeling nausea, numbness, having a stiff neck, weakness and problems speaking, NPR reported. Antifungal medications are used to treat fungal meningitis, according to the CDC. "

""Bhutan has decided to go for a green economy in light of the tremendous pressure we are exerting on the planet,"" Bhutan Agriculture Minister Pema Gyamtsho told AFP. ""If you go for very intensive agriculture it would imply the use of so many chemicals, which is not in keeping with our belief in Buddhism, which calls for us to live in harmony with nature.""Jigmi Thinley, Bhutan's prime minister, said at a Rio+20 Conference on Sustainable Development earlier this year that he wants to make ""the 'raised in Bhutan' label synonymous with 'organically grown,'"" according to Rodale. Rodale also reported that Bhutan is already largely organic, as many of the country's farmers don't use artificial pesticides or fertilizers anyway, one big reason being that they are too expensive. Most farmers in Bhutan grow crops like rice, corn, oranges and potatoes, NPR reported, but the country has started importing foods like rice over the last few years. Bhutan does export red rice to the United States, though it technically is not certified organic (even though red rice seller Lotus Foods says that the product doesn't have chemicals), according to NPR. In the United States, in order for a product to be considered ""organic"" it must be officially certified by the United States Department of Agriculture. ""Synthetic fertilizers, sewage sludge, irradiation, and genetic engineering may not be used,"" according to the USDA website:If you see the USDA organic seal, the product is certified organic and has 95 percent or more organic content. For multi-ingredient products such as bread or soup, if the label claims that it is made with specified organic ingredients, you can be confident that those specific ingredients have been certified organic."

But schools don't teach everything that our kids need to know. One of the key parts of life that children need to learn (but often don't learn it at school) is about credit, credit reports, and credit scores.Unfortunately, most children don't learn it at school and they discover it the hard way when they grow up, go to college, get a credit card, max out the credit card, and then spend years trying to fix those credit mistakes. (We did that or know someone who did that).You can do your kids a huge favor right now by teaching them about credit. Here's how you can help them:1. Teach your children about what credit reporting and credit scoring are. Tell them how their grandparents and great-grandparents didn't need credit reports to get loans but now lenders rely on credit scores to help them determine whether or not to lend and at what interest rate.  2. Teach your child what credit is and why good credit is important to have. Tell them that our credit score determines how much we pay for something. Give them a comparison between someone with good credit and someone with poor credit to show that someone with poor credit typically has a harder time getting loans and, when they do, they can pay thousands of dollars more because of higher interest.3. Teach your children about what makes up a credit score. Tell your kids that there are five areas that determine whether or not they are considered ""a good credit risk"" or ""a bad credit risk"" to lenders. Those five areas are: Payment history, balances owed, length of credit history, new credit, and types of credit. Show them what each one means and how responsible financial management can easily help keep all 5 of those credit-score-factors under control.4. Teach your child about how to manage credit. Help your children to understand why it's important to have good credit and what they need to do to get good credit and keep it. Teach them all the foundational financial management skills you wish someone taught you.The other way that you can give your children a head start in life is to help them start managing their credit early in life. Don't wait until they are out of the house and on their own for them to get a credit card. If your child is old enough, consider adding them on one of your accounts as an authorized user, this will help them learn about budgeting and credit scores and responsibility. If your children are very young (too young for a real credit card), you can still help them understand credit by talking to them and involving them when you use credit cards and then when you pay them.Our schools play an important part in educating our children but they don't teach them everything. As parents, you will want to give your kids a head start in life by teaching them about credit before they leave the nest. Email me your credit questions JeanneKelly@Kgroupconsulting.com"

Thank you, hon, for bringing so much beauty to all of us. Your legacy lives on in me and all of us you've touched,"" Ashley's boyfriend, Karl Westerberg -- known as Manila Luzon on the show -- said in a statement obtained by People. Heart failure affects nearly 6 million people in the United States, and can occur in people of any age. It is a condition where the heart's pumping ability is unable to keep up with the needs of the body, according to the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute: In some cases, the heart can't fill with enough blood. In other cases, the heart can't pump blood to the rest of the body with enough force. Some people have both problems.Heart failure can occur on one or both sides of the heart. If heart failure occurs on the left side of the heart -- called left-sided heart failure -- then that means the heart is unable to pump enough blood to other parts of the body, according to the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute. The Mayo Clinic reported that this form of heart failure is the most common, and can lead to fluid accumulating in the lungs. Right-sided heart failure, on the other hand, occurs when the heart is unable to pump adequate blood to the lungs. This form of heart failure can occur along left-sided heart failure, and can lead to fluid accumulation in other parts of the body, like the abdomen, feet, ankles, legs and internal organs like the liver, the Mayo Clinic reported. Systolic heart failure is another form of heart failure, where the left ventricle of the heart can't contract correctly; diastolic heart failure, another form, occurs when the left ventricle can't fill correctly, according to the Mayo Clinic. Heart failure usually manifests with a number of symptoms, including shortness of breath, fluid build-up in the form of swelling, coughing, feeling tired, heart palpitations, nausea and memory/thinking problems, the American Heart Association noted. The biggest causes of heart failure are high blood pressure, heart attack and coronary artery disease, according to the University of Maryland Medical Center. Other known risk factors include having a family history of heart disease, being a man, being African American, having diabetes or being obese, smoking, drinking, leading a sedentary lifestyle and using certain medications that could increase the risk of the condition.

The recently won prize was claimed almost immediately by Bret Naber, a member of the team.While pooling money with co-workers may increase the odds of a lottery win, it can also cause drama and even legal disputes in the work place. In May, two employees at a Chicago bakery sued their coworkers for not being given a share of the $118 million prize won in an office pool.
