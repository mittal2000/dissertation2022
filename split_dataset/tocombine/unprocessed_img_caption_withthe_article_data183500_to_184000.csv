I NEED A BEER"" or ""NEED MONEY FOR WEED,"" right? Now, an Ohio woman is bringing another brand of brutally honest begging to the streets: panhandling for her breast implant fund.WKYC reports that Chrissy Lance, a 37-year-old mother from Akron, Ohio, is taking to the streets with a cardboard sign declaring, ""Not homeless, need boobs!"" With a few smiley faces, of course.Lance, a bartender, university student and a single mom, needs $5,000 to get the implants, which she says will boost her self-esteem. She's standing at a busy intersection wearing a bikini and high-heeled boots, accompanied by a male friend who's serving as her bodyguard.Is this... legal? Lance claims to have a required panhandling license that allows her to seek her breast implants alms.At least she's going about it in an honest way -- back in May, a Phoenix woman was charged with fraud for faking breast cancer in order to collect donation money for a reconstructive surgery, which she then used to get her breasts enlarged purely for cosmetic reasons.And before you start scoffing and/or rolling your eyes at Lance's busking, her plan is already working -- Lance says she made $46 in just two hours standing on the curb. At $23 an hour, we calculated that she'd need to panhandle for 220 hours -- a full month -- to reach her plastic surgery goals.Dare to dream, we suppose.We hope Lance's plastic surgery doesn't turn out the way these procedures did...Want more?

People are starting to realize that the sugar- or artificial sugar-laden, artificially flavored, so-called healthy water drinks that every beverage company is trying to force down our throats are no different than other soft drinks. Instead of paying up for those manufactured waters that promise everything but don't deliver much more than a sugar rush, why not just drink regular water with a bit of flavor? It's so easy to make flavored waters with some fresh ingredients from the market. We'll show you how.Berries, slices of fresh fruit, herbs and even some vegetables can be used to reinvent your standard tap or spring water. It's just a matter of tossing those items into a jug of iced water (or if you prefer you could buy one of these fruit infusion jugs that keeps the fruit separated from the water). Whether you're simply looking for a way to cut down on your consumption of sugary drinks or are one of those individuals who dislikes the taste of water, then flavoring your own will especially appeal to you. Avoid those unhealthy drinks and flavor your own water for a change of pace. In the slideshow below, see all the refreshing ideas we've rounded up from around the web."

According to TMZ, the 33-year-old singer met with his lawyers earlier this week and requested they draw up a proposal to end his messy custody dispute with Foster over sons Usher Raymond V, 4, and Naviyd, 3. The deal would reportedly grant Foster ""a majority"" of custody -- the singer previously requested 50/50 child custody -- and ""significantly"" increase the amount of child support Foster would receive for the children. Foster has not yet been presented with the offer.The couple's divorce was finalized in 2009 after less than two years of marriage. But sources told Us Weekly that Usher shares a bond with his stepson, who was about six when the singer came into his life. ""He grew close to Kyle and, of course, that has nothing to do with the situation with Tameka,"" the source told magazine. ""He loved Kyle. This is a terrible, awful tragedy.""Usher's move to end the dispute is a marked departure from recent reports about his custody battle with Foster. In May, Foster denied claims that she threatened to kill the R&B star, admitting under oath that she had told him, ""I will f**k you up."" That same month, Usher reportedly refused Foster's request to allow her and their sons live permanently in the Georgia mansion he owns.Click through the slideshow below for 10 of the most notorious celebrity custody battles."
