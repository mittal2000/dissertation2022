Get ready, Manhattan, because you're about to be hit with another Blizzard. 75 years and 27 countries later, Dairy Queen is finally DQ'ing something different, and finding its way to the Big Apple. The new, two-story DQ Grill & Chill will have the ability to sit 100 lucky patrons when it opens in mid-to-late May, just in time for summer. In 2013, Dairy Queen opened a location just outside Manhattan, but the new location will be at 54 West 14th Street, between 5th and 6th Avenues. This is welcoming news for those a little closer to downtown who are ready to enjoy their favorite Georgia Mud Fudge Blizzard Treat or Orange Julius. Now that we've got one less reason to ever leave the city, we just have one question -- will the opening look anything like this DQ Harlem Shake below? If you're excited for this new addition, be sure to tweet #LOVEmyDQ and tell Dairy Queen.Clarification: Language in the headline has been amended to reflect that, despite the claim in the company's press release, New York City already had a Dairy Queen located in Staten Island. This will be the company's first location in Manhattan.Want to read more from HuffPost Taste? Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and Tumblr. "
1,FOOD & DRINK,The Surprisingly Beautiful Origin Of Saffron,Julie R. Thomson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/saffron-origin_us_5b9df0b1e4b03a1dcc8f2571,This is why it's so expensive.,2014-03-24,Threads are plucked from crocus flowers to make the world's most expensive spice.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9df0b1240000320053c879.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Saffron, the most sought after of spices, has its origins in the most beautiful of places. This exotic spice is sold in small bundles of long red strands and is heralded for the intense yellow color it imparts on dishes and the complexity of flavor it lends. Spanish paella and French bouillabaisse wouldn't be as enticing if it weren't for the saffron spice. Luckily, only a few threads are needed to give off its desirable flavor because saffron's price tag is steep (and that is a serious understatement). The price reflects the difficulty of harvesting though, and once you see where saffron comes from we think you'll be a little more forgiving. Read on and learn once and for all why this spice costs significantly more than its weight in gold. "
2,FOOD & DRINK,The 6 Biggest Mistakes People Make When Cooking Salmon,"Bon Appetit, Contributor

While we've been a huge proponent of the slow-roasting method lately, lots of people prefer to grill, pan sear, or poach their fish. So we asked the test kitchen -- manager Brad Leone, assistant food editor Claire Saffitz, and senior food editor Dawn Perry -- for their thoughts on why people often get this healthy fish so wrong.1. Yes, you should remove the pin bones -- but carefully. Pulling them up and out of the salmon will rip up its flesh, which is not a good look. Take tweezers and carefully pull out the pin bones in the same direction the bones are oriented in the salmon's flesh.SEE MORE: 23 Spring Recipes For Warmer Weather2. First of all -- skin is tasty! So when you're cooking salmon, keep that skin on: It provides a safety layer between your fish's flesh and a hot pan or grill. Start with the skin-side down, and let it crisp up. It's much easier to slide a fish spatula under the salmon's skin than under its delicate flesh. The only exception? You should remove the skin when you're poaching filets.3. Speaking of poaching, don't poach your salmon in plain water. It's a missed opportunity to add flavor! At the very least, spike the water with lemon or a half head of garlic. Better yet, go all out and poach the salmon in dry white wine. If you don't involve beautiful aromatics -- like these ones -- in the poaching process, the salmon might stink up your kitchen. Yuck.SEE MORE: 22 Recipes Everyone Should Know How to Cook4. When at the fish counter or fishmonger, consider your salmon options carefully. First off, don't turn your nose up at the belly -- it's fatty, rich, and full of flavor. Plus, it tends to be cheaper than filets. If you're going for a more traditional cut -- like a steak or a filet -- make sure you get pieces that are all the same size. The best bet is to ask for a center cut for uniform thickness. Finally, don't just get whatever salmon is on sale. Organic, responsibly raised salmon always tastes better (and is less likely to stink up your house).5. This is the most common mistake -- and often results in overcooking, meaning your fish will turn into cat food instead of the elegant dinner you were envisioning. If using a grill or a pan, sear salmon skin-side down on high heat until the skin is crispy, then, whether you flip your fish or not, finish cooking it on low heat. The fish's sections should give and pull apart easily -- not flake into dry pieces.6. Our assistant food editor, Claire Saffitz, firmly believes that cold, day-old salmon is better than its formerly piping-hot self. We definitely agree that you should give your leftovers some love: flake it into a salad, turn it into a sandwich, or just eat it straight from the fridge.
