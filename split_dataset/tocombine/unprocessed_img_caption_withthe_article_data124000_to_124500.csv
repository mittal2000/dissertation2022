Researchers from a score of top medical universities analyzed data from a 2000 Health Professionals’ Follow-up Study on nearly 26,000 men, 6 percent of whom had taken sildenafil, more commonly known as Viagra. The group that had a history of Viagra use had roughly double the risk of developing melanoma than those who hadn’t ever taken the drug, while those who were currently taking the drug had an 84 percent higher risk of developing melanoma, said the preliminary study, released Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine. Researchers said it’s still too early to alter prescriptions of the blue pill, but they urged increased investigation into its link to melanoma. “[P]eople who are on the medication and who have a high risk for developing melanoma may consider touching base with their primary care providers,” Dr. Abrar Qureshi, co-author of the study and professor and chair of the dermatology department in the Warren Alpert Medical School at Brown University, told NBC News. Though melanoma accounts for less than 2 percent of skin cancer cases each year, it makes up the majority of skin cancer fatalities. According to the American Cancer Society’s most recent estimates, about 9,710 people are expected to die of melanoma this year; 6,470 of those are men.The new study’s findings seem to fly in the face of a previously study that said Viagra could help defend against melanoma. In that 2011 study, conducted by Dr. Viktor Umansky and his team at the University Medical Center Mannheim, Viagra was shown to neutralize a melanoma tumor’s inflammatory immune response in a group of mice. However, as pointed out by Slate, there are many issues with medical trials on mice extending to human trial successes. "
1,TRAVEL,Luxe Chinese Dining and Blissful Swimming at the Shangri-La Paris,"Edward Schneider, Contributor
Travel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/luxe-chinese-dining-and-b_us_5b9df82ee4b03a1dcc8fb2dd,"If you're looking to treat yourself to a Paris luxury hotel but can't make up your mind which one, the Shangri-La's pool could well tip the balance.",2014-04-08,"The pool at the Shangri-La, Paris: oddly, it is far bigger than it looks in photos - 15 meters / 50 feet long",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9df82c3c000032000a5a73.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"In December 2012, Jackie and I had an excellent dinner at the restaurant l'Abeille in the Shangri-La Paris. As I wrote at the time, the hotel was not yet quite complete. A number of additional guest rooms have since been added, along with a handsome garden beside the restaurant, which adds charm and light to the dining room. Even with the new wing, the Shangri-La has only 101 rooms, which makes it one of the smaller Parisian ""palaces,"" and the staff is proactively welcoming and friendly in a way that is harder to achieve in a hotel half again as big. In this way it reminded me of the beloved Connaught in London (but with more marble and with views of the Eiffel Tower from many rooms).From our point of view, the most alluring of the new features is the best swimming pool I've seen in a Paris hotel. And not brand-new, but new to us, is the fine Chinese restaurant Shang Palace, where we had dinner. First, of course, we had to swim up an appetite.When I say that the pool is in the third basement, I'm not telling the whole story. The hotel is built on a steep hill; in its days as the house of Prince Roland Bonaparte, carriages would arrive at the front door on the Avenue d'Iéna (as cars do today), but the stables were through a grand arch down the hill at the rear of the building. Those stables have been converted to the spa, gym and pool, so there is plenty of natural light from that archway - and even a little outdoor café with a bonus view of the Tower. This is an ample space, and the pool is of ample size: 15 meters (50 feet) in length, which is amazing in a city-center hotel and provides scope for real swimming (not that what I do can be called ""real"" -- that's Jackie's department). Its design echoes some of the neighborhood's classical-cum-Déco architecture: simple columns and bas-relief panels reminiscent of the Palais de Chaillot, but with mildly exotic/Asian themes of palm trees, lotuses and so forth. The room is lofty and airy, but it is not plagued by the sort of echoey acoustics that can make a pool seem institutional: here, we felt almost as if we were at a resort.It is a lovely, even uplifting place to swim, with nice chaises longues, good changing rooms with steam baths and, more often than not, few other guests. The little gym is well equipped, and the rooms for (expensive) spa treatments are properly tranquil. In fact, if you're looking to treat yourself to a Paris luxury hotel but can't make up your mind which one, the Shangri-La's pool could well tip the balance.Hardly less tranquil is Shang Palace. Its décor is basically low-key French luxe with harmonious gestures to Asia. I usually disapprove of music in restaurants but was charmed by the elegant -- and not intrusive -- playing on the guzheng (an older relation of the more familiar Japanese koto). In many ways, the mostly Cantonese menu is reminiscent of those in the great hotels of Hong Kong, running through the expected categories of cold and hot starters, gorgeous roasts, soups, seafood, meat/poultry, vegetables and rice/noodles. What you won't find are dozens of variations on luxury ingredients such as abalone (which appears in just one soup) or unconscionable show-off items like shark's fin and swallow's nest: For all the décor, the wide space between tables and the consistently excellent, hospitable service, this is a down-to-earth, ""real"" restaurant that has become popular with Parisians as well as with travelers.Our dinner began with tofu skin house-smoked over pu-erh tea and rolled around al-dente vegetables and mushrooms; and flaky pastries filled with lots of caramelized onions and just the right amount of ham. Both were full of flavor, notably the pastries, which had a good zing of regular pepper and aromatic Sichuan ""pepper"" (which is not a pepper at all). At lunch time, the restaurant serves dim sum, and the quality of our starters suggests that these would be very good.I'm always curious to see what fancy restaurants make of home-style dishes, so we ordered mapo tofu and a dish of braised eggplant/aubergine with chicken. The tofu itself was fresh and creamy, and its pork-based sauce full of bright ginger and enough chili and Sichuan pepper to make it very lively but not too hot to enjoy -- if you're a chili-head, you will need to ask for a modified version or add some of the delicious chili condiment you'll find on the table. As I'd anticipated, the dish was not as oily as it would be in a Beijing hash-house; when ordering, I'd been a little worried that the lack of grease would compromise the pleasure. It didn't: This mapo tofu was elegant, but it was also authentic in its flavors and its spirit.The eggplant braise highlighted the quality of the restaurant's ingredients. It was made with a rich, balanced stock and its savoriness was deepened with shiitake mushrooms and dried fish. The dice of chicken was no afterthought: it was well integrated and of such clear poultry flavor that, even though it accounted for only a small part of the dish, it was there in every bite. The rice was plain and perfectly steamed.A lovely dessert was creamy, lightly coagulated ginger-infused milk that had been steamed. The coagulating agent was a ""chef's secret"" but the consistency was that of a soft rennet custard: a nice, subtle way to end the meal. We drank white wine from the Loire valley: a delicious Savennières recommended by the engaging sommelier and at €53 ($72) not expensive for this postal code. Shang Palace would be a good, relaxing option for entertaining guests, too: more dishes, more sharing, more fun. Note that advance booking is necessary: the reservation book fills up very quickly.Shang Palace restaurant.

2,PARENTING,College Students and Their Helicopter Parents: a Recipe for Stress,"Karl Gude, Contributor
Director of the Media Sandbox, Michigan State Univ. Instructor...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/parents-the-worst-kind-of_us_5b9df6dde4b03a1dcc8fa245,The reality is that life unfolds at its own pace and in its own way based on factors a person can control and many that they can't.,2014-04-08,2014-04-06-KleenexclassroomphotoforHuffingtonPostarticle.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-04-06-KleenexclassroomphotoforHuffingtonPostarticle-thumb.jpg,"Many university students are afraid of some pretty rough bullies: their parents. For years now, I've had a box of tissues permanently on hand in my office for when students come to see me. Often, their parents have forbidden them to study what they want and have pushed them into studying what the parents want, such as marketing instead of music and business instead of game design. ""You can't eat your dessert first, kids. You must earn it by eating your vegetables first.""Helicopter parents -- parents who micromanage their kids' every decision -- strong-arm their adult children into being ""mini-mes."" When they were young, parents dreamed of getting a ""good job,"" meaning one with high pay, good benefits and opportunities for advancement. Happiness wasn't a priority, but a perk. Financial security was the vegetable that earned them the dessert of happiness. Parents mean well and do these things because they love their kids and want them to get along in life, and they believe that choosing a financially ""stable"" job is the way to ensure that. Some students, particularly those who are unsure of what they want to do in life, buy into the idea that their parents know best, so they follow the plan that their folks have mapped out for them. Nevertheless, too many of them wind up in my office, miserable and with tissues in hand. When push comes to shove, these students define success the ""no-no"" way: being happy in life and work. We've all heard the saying that money can't buy happiness, but in many cases, happiness can buy money. If a person loves what they do, they're more likely to excel in it, which can lead to financial rewards, and conversely, a person doing a job without any passion for it probably won't invest much sweat equity in it. A career built on shaky ground isn't likely to stand the test of time. So, who doesn't want a good job? ""My kid, that's who. He wants to make video games!"" Wrong. He wants financial security, too. He's not an idiot. But he just wants his ""good job"" to be making video games and not doing tax law or selling stocks. Over-involved parents view their children as career-impaired drunk drivers who are going to steer their lives straight into the Breakdown Ditch of Failure. So, heroically, they muscle the decision wheel away from them and head straight toward good old Successland, where they grew up. As Chuck Palahniuk, author of Fight Club says, ""First your parents, they give you your life, but then they try to give you their life.""But parental meddling is costing kids a whole lot more than just lost dreams. More and more university students are feeling anxious, depressed and dissatisfied than ever before and this is due, in no small part, to the message many of their parents have been pounding them with: They can't be trusted to govern their own lives. According to a  study in the Journal of Child and Family Studies led by associate professor of psychology at the University of Mary Washington, Holly Schiffrin, ""Parents are sending an unintentional message to their children that they are not competent."" Time notes that the study lists three elements that must be present in people's lives for them to be happy: feeling autonomous, competent and connected to other people. Clearly, helicopter parents are depriving their kids of the first two, and I don't think that being joined at the hip to one's parents qualifies as being ""connected to other people,"" so nix the third one, too. Most of my students love and respect their parents but are terrified to confront them or go against their wishes, which is the power dynamic the parents have set up in their family. They're also terrified of disappointing them. The students who come to me... basically a stranger... feel desperate, lost and hopeless. (Wouldn't it be nice if they could go to their own parents?) They feel they are being forced into a life they don't want and never will and worse, one that will strangle their uniqueness. Jim Morrison, lead singer of the ""Doors,"" said it best, ""The most loving parents and relatives commit murder with smiles on their faces. They force us to destroy the person we really are: a subtle kind of murder."" Some of my students who have graduated feel tremendous pressure to give their parents an immediate return on their investment, and I've seen them beat themselves up if they aren't stepping directly into that dream job they spent four years studying for when they graduate. They feel like failures because they see graduation as the official starting gate in life's race to success. It's hard for a young person to win a horserace they don't even want to run in the first place. But, life is only a horserace if one chooses to see it that way, something I highly discourage when I speak to young people. The reality is that life unfolds at its own pace and in its own way based on factors a person can control and many that they can't. Having a wonderful life isn't about chasing a job and salary on some distant horizon; it's about the richness of the journey along the way. Truly happy people never even notice the horizon; they're too engaged in the exciting life going on around them. And the kicker is, if they work hard and do good work -- what's on the horizon will come to them. Helicopter parents, some advice: First the Don'ts: Don't bully your kids to do what you want by threatening to revoke money, love or whatever. Don't insist that they ""owe"" you for paying for their upbringing or for college. The first is your job and the second is your choice. Pay for their school or not, but let them decide who they want to be in life, and if you don't agree, well that's your problem. Don't ever call a teacher or your kid's prospective employer and don't go on a job interview with them! I mean, really? Don't meddle in their lives while they're in school or after they graduate, unless they ask. Now the Dos: Do respect and trust your kids. They'll rise to the occasion. Help them find a way to be successful doing what they want, whenever that is, which may be years. Support them when they fail without saying ""I told you so."" Get involved if it involves you. If they can't pay off their student loans, help, but don't demean them for it and don't order them around. Keep going with this and up your own list, with your child.Oh, and one more ""don't."" Don't be too hard on them if they seem incapable of thinking for themselves. You supported this dynamic all their lives. Deep wounds take time to heal.

The city dodged the first punch of a dangerous winter storm Tuesday, but forecasters warned of a potentially ""catastrophic"" second blow in a thick layer of ice that threatened to bring hundreds of thousands of power outages and leave people in their cold, dark homes for days. (AP Photo/David Tulis)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9defb31f00002d0021cde7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You already know that you should be booking your plane ticket 54 days before take-off (if all else fails, you should usually book between 104 to 29 days pre-trip). And while that's all fine and good, there are various nitty-gritty details you should be paying attention to when buying that ticket -- like day of flight and where to book. Luckily, the experts seem to agree on a few key points. Here are some of the tips we found most useful and you might too, so we're passing them along to you. Rick Seaney of FareCompare.com, CheapAir.com and the folks at Hopper.com  all agree: To get the best fares, you should always try to fly on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays. In particular, Hopper suggests that travelers should return from domestic trips on Tuesdays (to save up to $50) and from international trips on Wednesdays (to save roughly $60). The most expensive day to return is Friday. Because countless tour groups head across the pond throughout Europe's high season in the summer, CheapAir.com says, you should always play around with your dates if you're flexible.While this may seem like a no brainer, don't ever rely on a single airline's site (because, say, you have miles). It's always best to comparison shop, Seaney suggests. As for preferred days to buy, a study conducted last year stated that you should be purchasing those tickets on weekends; instead, Hopper suggests, the cheapest domestic tickets are more often found on Thursdays (to be fair, international tickets are generally cheaper on weekends). One important caveat: Expedia noted to us that three days before domestic departure, ticket prices drop by 6%; for international trips, the price drops by 10% about 7 days before departure. The lessons here: Buy early (if you can), buy on Thursdays and fly during the week. In case you forgot, here are those pesky “magic numbers” for when to buy for some common international destinations:Europe: 151 days before your flight Asia: 129 days before your flight The Caribbean: 101 days before your flight Mexico: 89 days before your flight Latin America: 80 days before your flight"
