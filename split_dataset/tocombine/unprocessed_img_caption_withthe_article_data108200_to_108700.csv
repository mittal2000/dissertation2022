Dozens of British military personnel are due to fly to Sierra Leone next week to help build medical facilities to combat the Ebola epidemic, the defence ministry said on October 7.

The two districts the teams cover include the capital, Freetown.""We have decided to stop working until they pay us our weekly risk allowance,"" Tamba Nyandemoh told Reuters. They have not been paid for two weeks, he said.The teams bury between 17 and 35 bodies daily, Nyandemoh said. Each team has 12 workers and every member of a team earns about $100 a week.Sierra Leone deputy health minister Madina Rahman said the teams have been paid through the end of September. They are only owed for this week, she said, and the money has been released to the banks and will be paid them later this week. She did not comment on the demand for risk pay.Abdul Rahman Rarker, a supervisor of a burial team, said the teams had been told of piles of dead bodies in and around Waterloo, in the Western Area Rural district south of the capital, Freetown.""But we cannot bury them because we are risking our lives and those in charge are depriving us of our money,"" he said.""We don't even care if dead bodies litter all over the city,"" another member of the burial team said, requesting anonymity. ""All we want is our money. We have been stigmatized in our communities, so let the government try to pay us our money.""The Ebola outbreak, the worst on record has killed 3,439 out of a total of 7,492 cases through Oct. 1, mostly in West Africa, the World Health Organization said last week.Since it started in the forest region of Guinea in March, the disease has spread to Sierra Leone and Liberia. Cases have also been recorded in Nigeria, Senegal, the United States and Spain. (Reporting by Umaru Fofana; Writing by Bate Felix; Editing by Larry King)"

2,POLITICS,Black Voters May Carry Kay Hagan To Victory In November,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kay-hagan-black-voters_n_5922468.html,,2014-10-06,"UNITED STATES - JULY 22: Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., conducts a meeting in the Senate Reception Room of the Capitol, July 22, 2014. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d83b2400005000577376.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"DURHAM, N.C. -- Chris Johnson is a senior at North Carolina Central University, a historically black university in Durham. In November, he’s planning to vote for Kay Hagan for Senate. Not that he knows who she is.“I just vote Democratic,” Johnson shrugged.“Same,” said his friend, John Jones, also a senior at NCCU.Several miles down the road, in Raleigh, Michael H. is working at a shoe store in Crabtree Valley Mall. He knows a little bit about Hagan, namely that she’s a Democrat, but it’s enough to get his vote.“Oh, I am going to vote. It’s out of sheer fear of being shamed,” said Michael, who is also African-American. “We have a lot of pressure from within my home to vote. We are a long line of voters, it comes down through generations and everything. My grandparents, my parents, my sisters; I would just be shamed. Shamed.”It's a razor-thin race between Hagan, a moderate Democrat who has put women's issues and raising the minimum wage at the center of her campaign, and Republican Thom Tillis, the state's House speaker and a driving force behind the legislature's sharp rightward shift.The outcome of the race -- and, perhaps, control of the Senate -- could come down to voters like Johnson, Jones, and Michael H. In a tight election year, Democrats are banking heavily on turning out the same coalition of voters that helped propel them to big victories in 2008 and 2012. In North Carolina, it looks like their investments may be paying off.HuffPost last week talked to two dozen randomly selected black voters in the Raleigh-Durham area -- on the streets, in shopping centers, on a college campus -- to see if they plan to vote in November. People were encouraged to be honest if they expected to skip out. Yet the responses were nearly universal: An emphatic yes to voting, even if they don't know much about who’s running.“Yes, I’m voting,” said Marilynn T. of Raleigh, who spoke from behind a perfume counter at Macy’s. “My schedule doesn't allow me to follow the candidates much. I go by what I hear around. But right now it appears that the Democratic Party is the party I’m going to go with. I’m not for the rich. I’m a working-class person.”""For sure,"" said B.J. Watson, a senior at NCCU, asked whether he would be voting. He conceded he doesn’t know anything about Hagan or Tillis, but said his sister works for a progressive environmental group and keeps him informed on politics. ""I go to her and she tells me what to do,"" he said.""Oh goodness, yes,"" added Gerry Fisher, a lifelong resident of Raleigh who works in a department store. ""It’s not like an odd-numbered year where the dog catcher gets elected or something. It's pretty important."" Many of the people approached by HuffPost said they’ve been bombarded by campaign ads and mailers about the Hagan-Tillis race. The targeted outreach from both campaigns is working.""I know enough about each candidate to know I like one and I don't like the other,” said Fisher.The plans of two dozen random voters certainly do not reflect those of the state’s entire African-American community. But the palpable enthusiasm HuffPost observed among black voters about the midterm election is precisely what Democrats are counting on. An Elon University poll from last month showed that black voters favored Hagan, while white voters tended to support Tillis. If Hagan can come close to rallying the black community at the levels that President Barack Obama did in previous elections, she is likely to win.Turnout in the African-American community was crucial to Hagan's victory in 2008, when she shared a ballot with Obama. A record 72 percent of black voters in the state went to the polls, compared to 66 percent of white voters, according to data from the State Board of Elections. In 2012, the numbers shifted slightly, but black voter turnout was still at 70.2 percent, while white voter turnout was at 68.6 percent.  NCCU students Dionne Wright, 19, Adonis Williams, 19, and Lyndon Bass, 19. All three plan to vote for the first time in November.It’s a different, more toxic, landscape in 2014. Obama’s popularity is sagging. And the highest-profile Senate races are all in Republican-leaning states. To bolster its candidates, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee has invested in an unprecedented get-out-the-vote operation. In North Carolina alone, it has 10,000 volunteers on the ground and is collaborating with a data analytics firm led by Obama's former campaign team. The hope is that digital content combined with grassroots summits and neighbor-to-neighbor organizing can boost voter turnout to levels on par with a presidential election year.One of the biggest focuses is on engaging the African-American community. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus, including Reps. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) and Donna Edwards (D-Md.), were both in the state last month stumping for Hagan and plan to return this month. The DSCC just launched a $1 million radio ad buy targeting black radio stations around the state.Hagan, meanwhile, has been meeting with faith leaders to ask for their help on the ground. She hosted an African-American summit in Raleigh last month, where more than 200 community leaders heard from Congressional Black Caucus members and others about the stakes of this election for the black community. “People I talk to say there’s two reasons they’re moved to vote: one is economic, the second is education,” said North Carolina state Rep. Larry Hall, who represents Durham and serves as the House minority leader. Republicans took control of the legislature and the governor’s office in 2012, and since then, they have ushered through significant cuts to education, among other things. That has taken a toll on the black community in particular, he said.“In the African-American community, schools are centers of daily life. Taking away teachers, cutting field trips because we have no money, no books … it’s palpable,” Hall said. “If there is energy in this election, it will be in the African-American community.”The first ad in the DSCC's recent buy ripped Tillis over his role in ushering in the education cuts as speaker of the North Carolina House. Many of the voters approached by HuffPost appeared to be motivated by concerns about education funding.“I have siblings who are teachers. They’re not getting raises. They’re not getting the supplies they need,"" said Carrolle Miller of Garner. ""That means it’s coming out of their pocket.""As for whether she plans to vote this year, she said, “I was raised so that every opportunity you have to vote, you vote.” NCCU senior Brittany Hicks is a criminal justice major. She said she's voting in November because ""I know my taxpayer dollars go toward what these people do. That's my money they're spending.""The topic most discussed at Hagan's summit, though, was voter suppression, according to a campaign staffer. Many in North Carolina are proud of the prominent role their state played in the 1960s civil rights movement, including sit-ins at a Woolworth’s store in Greensboro, which inspired similar protests in other cities in the South. Some consider it disrespectful that the legislature and governor last year passed laws making it harder to vote.“What I tried to convey was the issue of people taking away people’s rights,” Cummings said of his speech at the summit. “My mom and dad are from South Carolina. My dad was a sharecropper. People had to go through the poll tax and other hurdles just to be able to vote.”North Carolina's election laws are some of the most restrictive in the nation and have sparked a lawsuit by the U.S. Justice Department. The state has disallowed votes cast out of precinct, eliminated same-day registration, reduced the early voting period from 17 to 10 days, nixed pre-registration for high school students and imposed a strict voter ID law for 2016. Critics have been holding peaceful protests at the state legislature building in Raleigh for months, as part of an effort known as Moral Mondays. A federal court last week blocked two of the law’s provisions -- eliminating same-day registration and disallowing votes cast out of precinct -- but the other provisions remain.“This city is really one-sided,” said Leah Mills of Raleigh. “It favors a certain group of people. The money people. You can see it. I’ll just put it like that without being racist.”Mills said she sees laws being passed that disproportionately benefit white and economically well-off people. Given that some feel the system has been skewed against them, she said, African Americans in the state take voting seriously. “They take pride in voting down here. I know that for a fact. Because it affects them,” she said. “They know it affects them.” U.S. Rep. G. K. Butterfield (D-N.C.), whose district includes Durham, said that Republican groups have been misleading voters about which laws are in effect and what the deadlines are for registering to vote. He speculated that anger over disenfranchisement will end up driving more black voters to the polls.“I have voters tell me often that they’re disappointed that they’re going to have to produce an ID in this election, which is not true,” said Butterfield. “This whole debacle about election law changes, I think it’s going to backfire in the African-American community. I think it’s going to energize many voters who otherwise would be ambivalent.” Omar Beasley and Walter Jackson of The Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People.One organization trying to make sure people have accurate voting information is The Durham Committee on the Affairs of Black People. The group, which been operational since 1935 and played a role in the sit-in movements of the 1960s, carries significant sway in the community. HuffPost sat down with its leaders at Ideas Coffee House, where the group meets. Framed posters of Obama decorated the walls. A small table offered an array of Ebony magazines, the most prominent of which was a 1980 edition with Bill Cosby on the cover.“Certainly, there are those who are trying to spread confusion to suppress voter turnout this time,” said Walter Jackson, 70, who runs the political arm of the group. “We are doing all we can to get the word out to let them know those changes are not yet in effect.”Jackson's group endorsed Hagan last month and started doing voter outreach well before that. “We’re working hard,” said Jackson, who later finagled a ride with HuffPost to the NCCU campus so he could talk to students about voting. He predicted Hagan will win in November, though he wouldn't guess the margin of victory.“I don't care if it's by one vote,” he said. “We just need her to win.”"
3,WORLDPOST,Turns Out Henry Kissinger Really Despised Castro and the Cubans,"Daniel R. DePetris, ContributorNational Security Dude, Observer of Congress, Currently Outsid...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/turns-out-henry-kissinger_b_5922858.html,Thanks to the good folks and diligent researchers at the National Security Archive--a research organization at George Washington University--Americans will now be able to add another placeholder for the former Secretary of State: hater of the Castros.,2014-10-06,2014-10-02-HenryKissingerandGeraldRFordintheOvalOffice.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-02-HenryKissingerandGeraldRFordintheOvalOffice-thumb.jpg,"Henry Kissinger is known for a lot of things: professor; dean of the foreign policy realists; National Security Adviser for President Richard Nixon; Secretary of State for President Gerald Ford; negotiator of the Paris Peace Accords that ended U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War; the man who preyed with Nixon at the height of his distress over the Watergate scandal. The 91-year old is still offering his foreign policy and national security advise to countless administrations, can be seen on television doing interviews on occasion, and served often as outside counselor to the George W. Bush administration on the Iraq War. Thanks to the good folks and diligent researchers at the National Security Archive--a research organization at George Washington University--Americans will now be able to add another placeholder for the former Secretary of State: hater of the Castros. On the face of it, this shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. The historical record on U.S.-Cuba relations is quite clear: successive administrations for decades have attempted to kill Fidel Castro, overthrow his regime, and create something in its place that would increase American influence on the island 90 miles south of the U.S. mainland. All of those plots have failed, from the 1960 Bay of Pigs disaster to the numerous failed assassination attempts on Castro himself. The most successful policy that the United States can point to is the Cuban embargo, which has been in place for over half a century and was originally designed to make life so miserable for the Cubans that they would take matters into their owns and get rid of the Castro clan themselves. Gerald R. Ford FoundationWhat is interesting from the newly declassified documents, however, is the fact that the United States in general and Henry Kissinger in particular were so peeved by Cuban interference in Africa during the 1970's that they were actively planning a bombing run on Cuban military infrastructure and a tightening of the embargo around the island. The conversations reached President Gerald Ford directly, when on March 24, 1976, Kissinger argued to the president in the Situation Room that Washington needed to punish the Castro regime for its blatant military involvement in Angola at the height of the Cold War: Kissinger: That is a possibility -- I may have to go out there if it really gets bad. I think sooner or later we have tq crack the Cubans. I talked to Yamani last Friday and even the Iranians are worried about the Cubans getting into the Middle East countries. I think we have to humiliate them. If they move into Namibia or Rhodesia, I would be in favor of clobbering them. That would create a furor and we might have to come out for black rule. But I think we might have to demand they get out of Africa.On President Ford's orders, Kissinger was authorized to assemble a secret working group with representatives from the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Defense Department, State Department, the Central Intelligence Agency, and National Security Council to explore what the United States could do to ensure that retaliatory measures taken against Castro for Cuba's involvement in Africa were effective and would get the messages across. The discussions were so intense that a few inter-agency papers were produced outlining the political, economic, and military options Washington could employ against the Cuban Government to deter their meddling in a third-world Cold War battleground. The list includes everything from a quarantine by the U.S. Navy, which would block any military equipment from reaching or leaving the island, to diplomatic moves like slapping trade sanctions on Cuba at the the United Nations and lobbying Cuba's Asian and Latin American partners to stop their credit financing or assistance programs. One of the more interesting choices that the team explored was a punitive U.S. military strike on important Cuban military installations and facilities:""The Atlantic Command will conduct military operations in Cuba to defend NAVBASEGTMO; and to destroy selected high value Cuban military and military supporting targets which will have the maximum punitive impact in order to counter specific acts of Cuban aggression.""Viewed in full, the declassified documents demonstrate just how much time, energy, and man hours the Ford administration put into this project. The planning memos and options papers were rich in detail and covered every policy under the sun that could be used to deter Castro from continuing down his interventionist path. The full series of documents can be found here. One wonders whether Kissinger and Castro have forgiven one another in their later years of life.￼￼"
4,WOMEN,Gender Equality = Men + Women Working Together,"Susan Bulkeley Butler, ContributorAuthor, speaker, CEO of The SBB Institute for the Development ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gender-equality-men-women_b_5924828.html,"Unless the men at the top of our organizations strategically decide that equality at the top is the right thing to do, it won't happen.",2014-10-06,"NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 20: UN Women Goodwill Ambassador Emma Watson (C ) attends the HeForShe campaign launch at the United Nations on September 20, 2014 in New York, New York. (Photo by Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5fd3a2400005100569497.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Throughout my career and my life advocating for women's equality in the workplace, I've come to realize something: Gender equality for women cannot happen without men.It was great to hear, then, about the new United Nations program HeForShe -- appropriately characterized as ""a solidarity movement for gender quality.""Actress, women's rights activist and U.N. Women Goodwill Ambassador Emma Watson introduced the HeForShe program to the world at a special event in New York last week. ""We want to try and galvanize as many men and boys as possible to be advocates for gender equality,"" Watson said. ""And we don't just want to talk about it, but make sure it is tangible."" Read the entire speech here.As Watson declared at the U.N., she is a feminist. She is proud to stand up and say that, despite the fact that the word ""feminist"" can be ""uncomfortable.""I, too, understand the uncomfortableness that comes with the word. But I have decided I am a feminist. In 1965, when I hired as the first woman professional at Arthur Andersen & Co., I didn't think of myself as a feminist. Early on, I had a job, and soon realized that I needed to concentrate on ""my career."" How was I going to be admitted to the Partnership? Fortunately, I had male friends to focus me in the right direction for promotion and to help begin to bring about equality. I got my first job at Arthur Andersen thanks to the foresight of a male professor at Purdue and others who realized that getting the job done right didn't depend on gender. Fourteen years later, when I was named the first female partner of Andersen Consulting -- now known as Accenture -- it was also because of the forward-thinking actions of many male partners.We've come a long way, but women's success still depends on men -- whether we like it or not. The fact of the matter is that, with men holding 95 percent of the CEO positions and about 85 percent of all executive positions Fortune 500 companies, women simply cannot advance without the support of the men who are currently in charge. Unless the men at the top of our organizations strategically decide that equality at the top is the right thing to do, it won't happen.For real change, and in order to get more women in charge, today's CEO's (mostly men) must have a strategy to achieve equality for men and women. This is more than having a concerted effort to recruit women professionals. They must ""create the pipeline"" for women, to ensure there are ample women candidates for all leadership positions when they become available. And they must make sure there are sponsorship and mentoring programs for women to show them the way.The U.N. isn't the first governmental body to recognize the importance of men in the gender equality equation. Australia's appointed Sex Discrimination Commissioner in 2010 established that country's Male Champions of Change collaboration to have the male leaders make significant and sustainable change in the number of women in leadership roles in Australian companies, government and society. The 30% Coalition, a group I belong to, organized a Champions of Change program. These executives seek to promote gender diversity in the corporate boardroom. They are public advocates to encourage other leaders to support their mission... to enlist more men in top corporate positions to recruit and develop more women to fill board seats.With the HeForShe program, the United Nations recognizes that gender equality is a human right, and that having women in leadership roles makes society better in a myriad of ways.Smart businesses realize also that gender equality makes companies better in a myriad of ways too.According to Catalyst's groundbreaking 2011 study, ""The Bottom Line: Corporate Performance and Women's Representation on Boards,"" companies with three or more women board directors on average outperformed companies with zero women board directors -- by 84 percent when measured by return on sales and 60 percent when measured by return on invested capital.Improving gender equality in the workplace means improving corporate decision-making. Having women in the board room and in the executive suite means having better insight into half of the world's population; having insight into the minds of consumers who make most household buying decisions and having insight into the people who control more than half of all personal wealth and stock ownership in America.But as Emma Watson points out, when it comes to gender equality in the workplace, we don't just want ""to talk about it, but make sure it is tangible.""To do that, we must hold male leaders accountable. We must not just let them ""check the box"" on diversity. There needs to be accountability. As shareholders, board members, investors and consumers, we need to make sure we hold them accountable to make companies more diverse, and in turn, stronger and better.Corporate executives -- men and women -- should be measured by equality goals, as well as financial goals. Their performance -- and their pay -- should be impacted accordingly. Like Emma Watson, I truly believe that men need to take up the mantle to advance women in leadership positions.Men -- fathers, brothers, friends, neighbors -- should want equality for all just as much as women want equality for all... especially when they have spouses, daughters and granddaughters."
5,HEALTHY LIVING,How to Show Up for Life Like Derek Jeter: It's All About the Breath!,"Allison Carmen, ContributorAuthor of The Gift of Maybe",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-show-up-for-life-l_b_5926486.html,,2014-10-06,2014-10-03-220pxDerek_Jeter_pregame_ground_balls_2011.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-10-03-220pxDerek_Jeter_pregame_ground_balls_2011-thumb.jpg,"I know many of us have been watching or hearing about Derek Jeter's last few games in Major League Baseball. During his last home game, when he hit the single that drove a winning run home, one of the announcers said, ""When everything speeds up, Derek Jeter slows down."" Hearing this, I paused and thought to myself, ""Now that is a key to success.""For most of us, when life gets busy, the kids are screaming, we have a work deadline or someone we love is sick, our minds start racing. There are so many demands on us that we don't have enough time to come up with immediate solutions to our problems. Life is moving quickly, and we jump right on that fast-moving train. The problem is that speeding up in our minds when life around us is busy and chaotic can cause a lot of stress, worry and anxiety. Sometimes we stop sleeping, and it's actually emotionally and physically harder to get everything done. Our thoughts take too much of our energy, while our bodies do not receive enough. We start making mistakes, dropping the ball as it were.So how can we slow down when life speeds up and take the Derek Jeter approach to life? One of the easiest, most available tools that we always have at our fingertips is our breath.Our thoughts and emotions are closely linked to our breath. Our thoughts and emotions often control the way that we breathe and, in turn, the way we breathe often affects how we think. So when life speeds up and so many things are happening around us, we tend to focus on inhaling and breathing at a faster pace, and our breath becomes more shallow. Our speech speeds up or becomes unclear. We never seem to be able to get our point across clearly and concisely. This can lead us even further into feelings of stress, worry and anxiety. Also, even when we think we are breathing normally, our breath may actually be reaching only the upper region of our lungs, from which point the breath goes primarily to our heads. When our energy is all in our head, our thoughts take control of our body. We become consumed with our thoughts and lack awareness of our body or our intuitions. When we generate too many thoughts, we can become overwhelmed when emotions arise. Overthinking, we lose our focus.Awareness of our breath, on the other hand, creates space in our minds and expands our sense of time. When we become aware of our breath, it is easier to pause and take long, deep breaths. Even one deep breath in the midst of chaos and a busy schedule can provide us with enough space and time to ask, ""How do I want to react to this situation?"" If you are able to take a few deep breaths, you may be able to prevent a knee-jerk reaction and calm your body down. With practice, the breath can become a safe haven that we can rely on in everyday life as well as in very stressful situations. As we become more aware of the rhythm of breath and slow it down, whatever is overactive in the body or mind calms down. Our thoughts and emotions align with the slower rhythm of the breath and we can relax more in response to whatever we face. As the breath slows down and grows softer and steadier, instead of depleting our energy we are able to nourish our mind and body with a peace and tranquility. In a more relaxed state, the outer world no longer controls our every thought and emotion. We are able to find more of a balance and act more clearly and effectively.The truth is I have no idea what Derek Jeter has done the last 20 years to maintain his composure and attitude, a stance that has played such a large part in his success. Maybe it is his natural disposition, his upbringing, or MAYBE he is aware of his breath! Whether or not we're professional baseball players, most of us can use a little help every day staying calm and focused in whatever we may face with our children, work or even driving in traffic. Staying aware of the breath is a great way to try to balance our mind.Try it. Maybe you'll find you are more Jeter-esque and get game winning results!Photo: By Keith Allison (Flickr: Derek Jeter) [CC-BY-SA-2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons"
6,WOMEN,What Emma Watson's U.N. Speech on Feminism Means For Men,"Barbara McNally, ContributorFounder of the Barbara McNally Foundation and author of Wou...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-emma-watsons-un-spee_b_5927282.html,"While our beloved celebrities may win awards for their on-screen personas, the public is usually pretty conscientious of who actually has a heart invested in their said foundations and organizations and who has a publicist shoving an agenda down their throat.",2014-10-06,"NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 20: Actress Emma Watson attends the UN Women's 'HeForShe' VIP After Party at The Peninsula Hotel on September 20, 2014 in New York City. (Photo by Jim Spellman/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5fd3c1f0000df002495e6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Daily, we see celebrities representing the face of various products and causes. From makeup to lotion to political fundraisers to controlling the pet population, the endorsements abound. While our beloved celebrities may win awards for their on-screen personas, the public is usually pretty conscientious of who actually has a heart invested in their said foundations and organizations and who has a publicist shoving an agenda down their throat. When passion is ignited, people don't see that... they feel it. And Emma Watson is not just ignited; she is burning with that passion and passing the torch right along -- all the way from the podium of the United Nations.Emma took to the mic to highlight the importance and urgency of the gender equality movement known as the HeForShe Campaign.The speech focused on societal misconceptions of the feminist movement and instead of focusing on the word ""feminist,"" she put the spotlight on the mission and ambition behind the word.An interesting focus of her speech was encouraging society to think of the many ways gender inequality is also a problem for the males of the world. Her words shook the gender scales and have sparked discussions from both women and men on how gender discrimination is an issue affecting men just as much as it is a concern for women. Here are five reasons the feminist movement pertains to males as well:1. Disapproval of the domestic male. Males are not taken as seriously if they decide to have a significant domestic role (also known as ""Mr. Mom"" reproach). Emma was quick to acknowledge her father as a key nurturing figure in her life, and how society viewed this characteristic in a condemning light. If women are expected to be the primary nurturer by default, this automatically eliminates males who wish to step into the role as more of a principle figure. 2. Rising male mental illness. Emma noted that in the UK, suicide is the leading killer of men age 20-49. This statistic surpasses deaths caused by accidents, cancer and coronary heart disease. A significant reason suicide has such a precedence is because men feel unable to ask for help as it will give the appearance they are somehow less of a ""man."" If females are solely categorized as the ""sensitive communicators"" this leaves little room for a male to feel empowered to voice his needs, and process vital feelings. 3. Closeted sexuality and gender identity issues. A New York Times study shows millions of gay men still remain in the closet. Gay men are half as likely as straight men to acknowledge their sexuality on social networks. A tenth of gay men say that they do not even tell their inner circle about their sexuality. Gay porn searches are, for the most part, equally prevalent in all states, including conservative ones. This suggests that there are just as many gay men in less tolerant states as there are in accepting states -- they're just suffering in secret. Statisticians of this study also noted a common assumption from wives is that their husbands may be gay, saying, ""In the United States, of all Google searches that begin 'Is my husband...,' the most common word to follow is 'gay.'"" Alarmingly, 21 of the 25 states where this question is most frequently probed, support for gay rights is lower than the national average. In other words, many men are directly affected by how society presents and personifies the male gender. 4. Male aggression repercussions. Whether the aggression is within the confines of a corporate boardroom or bedroom walls, males have been conditioned to seek a dominating stance within their relationships (be it co-workers or significant others) and often encouraged to underplay the significance of their aggressive behavior. To allow a woman to rise to an equal or upper hand is often referred to as ""being whipped"" or other condescending terms.What this conditioning also advocates is submission. If the male is to render respect as the ""top dog"" that therefore means the woman must submit to these terms. This superiority rationale leads to repercussions far beyond basic equality. Statistics show that men make up the majority of gun owners, gang members, sexual assailants, domestic abusers, and stalkers. According to the Federal Bureau of Prisons, males make up 93.3% of prison inmates. Males also comprise of the majority of corporate fraud. When men are conditioned to seek and expect control of outside forces, they often lose control of their inner forces, including their actions.5. Intense success standards. Just as women may fall victim to extraordinary body image standards, men are facing stark insecurities caused by a distorted sense of what it means to be society's definition of a successful man. The stakes keep advancing, leaving men to feel as if they will never reach this unrealistic expectation of a ""norm"" placed upon them. If society encouraged both men and women to reach for the same stars, the weight of the world wouldn't fall so hard on the male shoulder. So, clearly ""feminism"" is not an isolated female issue... it is a human race issue. Emma closed on a personal note, saying:You might be thinking, 'Who is this Harry Potter girl and what is she doing speaking at the UN?' and that's a really good question and I've been asking myself the same thing. All I know is that I care about this problem and I want to make it better. And having seen what I've seen, and given the chance, I feel it is my responsibility to say something. It is our hope that you will continue to ask yourself the same questions when you are faced with challenges in your own life. Participate in solution-driven conversations, and invite MEN into those conversations. Free yourself and others of gender stereotypes. When men are empowered to embrace their authentic selves, women will reap those benefits as a direct result. Give yourselves permission to be strong, vulnerable, intelligent and expansive. But most importantly, as Emma so eloquently put it, ""It is time that we all perceive gender on a spectrum -- not as two opposing sets of ideals."""

Linda and I celebrated our 18th anniversary today...(you may applaud). We had trouble deciding if we were going to dine at some fancy restaurant where arrogant waiters can't speak English or stay home and boil in the hot tub and enjoy a few glasses of wine. The wine and hot tub won.I had ordered some flowers for the occasion and Linda asked me if I chose purple Lisianthus with Gerbera Daisies mixed in for added charm.Do What???She said, ""Honey, I always hint that I like purple Lisianthus and Gerbera Daises and you always get me an assortment of flowers. These assortments always include Lilies but Lilies remind me of funerals.""OOPS!!!I responded ""There's not one man alive on Planet Earth who can remember to buy flowers named ""Purple Lisianthus"" much less remember how to pronounce and spell it. Also, I had no idea the Gerber Baby Food company had started selling flowers on the side.My attempt at flower humor fell flat at which point I offered to order more flowers. Linda responded by saying, ""You can't give a girl too many flowers."" So, I got on the computer and began the search.The ill-fated ""assortment"" arrived at 3 p.m. and the beloved Purple Lisianthus mixed with Gerber Daises arrived at 5 p.m.I am proud to say that the dog house is closed and locked for the remainder of the month. I do dearly love that woman. She knows what she wants and she's never afraid to say it. After all these years, I'm damn lucky she still wants me."

Steve Green and his family, owners of the Hobby Lobby, are building the Bible Museum. (photo by Andre Chung for The Washington Post via Getty Images) MAGAZINE",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7eff8220000ba01dd3272.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON (RNS) Museum of the Bible.That’s it.The name of the museum under construction in Washington, D.C., is official.“We don’t need more to tell people who and what we are,” the museum’s founder and funder, Steve Green, told Religion News Service.But, as always with the Bible, nothing is ever simple.The high-tech museum, set to open in fall 2017, is four blocks from the U.S. Capitol and three blocks from a global tourism mecca, the Air and Space Museum. The new museum will feature standing exhibits on the history and impact of the Bible as well as interactive features to bring viewers into Bible stories and characters.It’s the passionate project of Green, the Hobby Lobby billionaire who would prefer to be known for his world-class Bible artifacts collection than for his victorious Supreme Court fight for exemption from the Affordable Care Act contraception mandate.Religious freedom, he says, is a biblical concept. The Green family — generations of Pentecostals and Baptists — has long funded Bible scholarship, biblical archaeology and the drafting of a proposed public school curriculum on the Bible’s historic, cultural and artistic impact on the U.S. and the world.All are controversial endeavors, particularly given Green’s personal commitment to spread the good word about the Good Book.Yet, Green insists, this is not an $800 million monument to personal evangelism. Unlike Answers in Genesis, the ministry that launched the Creation Museum in Kentucky and an Ark Encounter park under construction, employees need not pass a Christians-only litmus test. Green said believers, skeptics and the “intellectually curious” alike can visit and learn, just as they might at a science museum.“The Bible can speak for itself, explain itself.”Blowback since the museum’s announcement in 2011 doesn’t bother him. “Anytime you do anything with the Bible, people respond with emotion — emotion for and against it. That people want to express their love or their hate is not surprising.”To Green, the controversies simply prove the timeless intrigue of the Bible. “There really isn’t a barrier for this book.”Hence, the simple, symbolic and super modern logo featuring a B-as-in-Bible set on its side.Or is it a lowercase ‘m’ for museum, underscored?Or a set of archways leading toward the path of your own choosing?Or the tablets of the Ten Commandments?Or the curled open pages of a book?All the above, said Jonathan Alger, one of the founding partners of C&G Partners, the design firm that created the logo and brand imagery.Like the Bible, the logo is “a vessel for what you pour into it.”“When you are making an identity to reflect a museum about the Bible, it has to be simple and respectful,” Alger said.His firm aimed for something “stylish, international, unexpected and very modern,” so even the typography mattered. Choice of the font was critical.The museum signage and logo are in a European font known as DIN, “originally invented to make roadway signs in Europe more visible and safe. It was designed for clarity, to help people find their way.”How very biblical. "
