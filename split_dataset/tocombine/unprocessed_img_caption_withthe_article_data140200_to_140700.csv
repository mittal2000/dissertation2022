Having a piping-hot meal delivered right to your hotel room lets you know that you've arrived. It's comforting, nourishing, and downright convenient. To find out what travelers were ordering, The Daily Meal reached out to hotels across the country to see what dishes topped the list of in-room best-sellers.

Who would have guessed that Maryland crabcakes were the most-ordered dish at a New York City hotel? But others were totally expected, like the fact that guests at a Washington, D.C. hotel known for hosting business professionals were most likely to request a healthy yogurt, fruit, and granola plate.Although room service is typically thought of as a lazy morning treat, breakfast foods only represent six of the 13 items on our list. When it comes to room service, it turns out that comfort, not time of day, is the bigger factor in determining what guests will order. And the majority of the most popular room service items on our list are, well, comfort foods -- pancakes, eggs, burgers, and pizza all make an appearance, but regional differences also tend to influence menus. For example, Rhode Island visitors prefer their hash with some lobster, while travelers in Texas often request Mexican-influenced huevos rancheros to start their days.Click Here to see the 101 Best Hotel Restaurants Around the World 2013Regardless of the location , travelers across the country can probably agree that ordering room service can make you feel more at home, and not to mention, satisfied.

The Federal Aviation Administration has grounded all U.S.-registered Boeing 787 Dreamliner jets for the repair of batteries believed to be linked to a fire risk following a number of related 787 aircraft incidents this month.

United will not honor those reservations because the extremely low prices resulted from users' ""knowing manipulation of United.com,"" United spokesman Charlie Hobart told The Huffington Post. As such, he says, United isn't on the hook.On Monday, Mashable reported visitors to United.com were able to ""trick"" the site into thinking they had more frequent flier miles than they actually did. By booking a reservation in two different tabs of a browser, customers could game a loophole and redeem unlimited miles.The loophole allowed customers to purchase tickets at insane prices, with a roundtrip fare from Newark, N.J., to Dublin, for example, coming to just $49.40, the cost of taxes. International Business Times succeeded in reserving a last-minute roundtrip flight from Newark to London's Heathrow Airport, normally priced at about $1,278, for virtually no cost.After an incident last month resulted in substantially reduced fares through United.com, the airline decided to honor the tickets, many of which had been sold for between $5 and $10 each. A Wall Street Journal article at the time argued United's decision to eat the cost of those tickets was a smart move, though the airline could have challenged their validity if it wanted to.However, last month's tickets were sold for next to nothing because of human error; specifically, ""incorrectly entered information,"" Hobart said. This time around, the airline is pointing its finger back at the passengers. Many have chosen to make noise about the recent verdict via a Change.org petition addressed to United CEO Jeff Smisek. Titled ""United Airlines, Inc.: Honor the Tickets,"" the petition states:United Airlines Inc. is accusing their customers of 'intentional manipulation' of their website in order to achieve these discounted rates. In reality all one had to do in order to have 'intentionally manipulated' their website was have two tabs open when searching for tickets, or simply press the refresh button on the window they were currently on. Both of these are common practice for anyone looking for tickets for a flight..."

As a 40-year yoga practitioner, with over two decades practicing massage therapy and teaching yoga, I have seen countless injuries, chronic pain and joint issues in yoga clients of every age and fitness level. My work and investigations with yoga injuries has revealed certain yoga poses engage the body in positions that are unnatural for the design of the human body. In this series of posts, I will explain why these poses need to be radically modified or eliminated to protect yoga practitioners from finding out that which was considered to be useful may in time prove to be harmful. The sad truth is that years of practicing body positions that do not simulate real life function can lead to misalignment, chronic pain, and even surgical replacements.To be smart and safe in yoga, we need to consider postural alignment and natural joint function, rather than blindly following a list of ""must-do"" traditional poses and boot camp challenges.Yoga Can Heal and Yoga Can Hurt Paschimottasana and Uttanasana are straight leg seated forward bending poses practiced from sitting or standing that go against how our body is ""wired"" to move. These poses and many variations are practiced with the compartmentalized idea that stretching the back while keeping the knees straight will lengthen the hamstrings and make the spinal column more flexible. But how does this contribute to real life anatomical function and a balance of postural dynamics?Stop driving with your parking brakes on.We must bend at least one knee to move forward. When both knees are straightened and we stretch forward as in yoga forward bends, we are driving with our brakes on and stretching the ligament forces needed for natural anatomical function. Try to walk without bending your knees and you will get the global picture of how your body works. Can you feel the unnatural torque and tension in the lower back and knees?Touching your toes is a waste of time and could prove to be harmful in the long run.All standing and seated forward bends with knees straight and ankles flexed in right angles undermine the spine's integrity creating the C shape, or slouch, stressing the necessary ligament tension needed for natural joint functions of our spine, hips and knees.Keep your sexy curves by not engaging your body in straight lines! We are not made of parts. Our body is made of curves, global in nature, and all parts affect the whole. We all want to be healthy and feel peaceful in body and mind. What is the purpose and function of doing yoga poses that flatten the curves, and stretch out the very seams of the fabric that holds us together?Forward bends with straight knees can give you a flat butt!Before and After YogAlign PracticeMany yogis wind up with a flat butt and sagging posture from ligaments that are too loose. Ligaments need to be ""tight"" enough to keep the hip joint stable during normal activity and movement.The gluteus muscles are stretched out and weakened when we do straight leg forward bends because the butt muscles cannot functionally activate if both knees are straight. This is why people with strong tight butts have difficulty doing forward bends with their knees straight. The flexible and bendy people have no trouble doing these poses and it can even feel ""good,"" but over the long run, this flexibility becomes a liability. The sacroiliac (SI) joint ligaments become lax and the hip joint is destabilized, lacking shock absorbing forces needed to protect joint function. Many famous yoga teachers and long time practitioners are getting hip and knee replacements as a result of over-stretching the SI joint as practiced in straight leg seated and standing forward bends. Babies know best.Watch a toddler move and bend over. When they lean over to pick up a toy, they move from core center, hips back, with knees bent and butt and leg muscles working. This is why all babies have cute butts.Bend your knees, not your spine!When we lean forward from sitting or standing without bending our knees, we are asking the spine to stretch in ways it is not designed. Any back doctor will tell you to always bend your knees when leaning over. Why does yoga get a hall pass to ignore this basic anatomical rule to bend the knees?Protect your spine and lower back curves in yoga: Keep your knees deeply bent in all seated and standing forward bends, and stay out of all yoga poses that create a C shape in the spinal column. Align, don't contort. Before and After YogAlign PracticeIn order for yoga to evolve and be safe for all, we must use critical thinking, discernment, awareness and simple bio-mechanical common sense.I always remind my students to practice naturally aligned posture as the most important asana. If an asana does not support your spine in good posture, it is quite possibly working to pull your body out of alignment, and what is the benefit of doing it? Three simple tests to determine whether a pose serves the human design:1. It should allow the spine to maintain its natural curves. 2. It should not restrict the ability to do deep, rib-cage breathing. 3. It should have a real-life correlation to functional joint movement.Yogis need to take off the avidyas (blinders) and consider the long-range effects of yoga poses on the human body. Is the pose or position going to lead to a favorable outcome adding value to our lives and supporting the ancient wisdom of the yoga sutras?"

Schindler,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d99722100003000c59696.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Maybe you live in a neighborhood full of Halloween pop-up stores, for one or two months of the year occupying that seemingly hopeless and possibly contaminated real estate that used to be a bank, now full of cellophane chicken costumes and last year's super-villains, swords, staffs, brooms, sexy gags and desultory salespeople. Last-chance saloons are what these sort of resemble, especially here in this age of commercial hyper-availability, and yet it's amazing how often such last chances tend to sneak up.Halloween book displays are a little like that too: waxy and soulless, the candy corn baggies at the bottom of your trick-or-treat haul. Bring us your melancholy pumpkins, your underachieving witches, your orange and black algorithms calculated not to strike fear.Then it's off to the pulper (then turkeys, then elves), yet I can't help thinking we miss a precious opportunity every autumn to reconnect with the sort genuinely mysterious and often unsettling legends we have told since back when we were sleeping in caves. The books listed here will probably not appear in any seasonal displays at your local mega-mart, but they have not entirely disappeared either -- after two, after 10, after 17 years -- still shadows dancing across the darkest pagan night.
