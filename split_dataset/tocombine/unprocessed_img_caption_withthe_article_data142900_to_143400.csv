The latest Ranbaxy import",2013-09-18,"INDIA - AUGUST 29: Female scientist working at SRL Ranbaxy Laboratories (Ranbaxy Lab), in Mumbai, India (Photo by Soumik Kar/The India Today Group/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d85f9240000310053a012.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Sumeet ChatterjeeSept 18 (Reuters) - During a visit to a facility of leading Indian drugmaker Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd last year, U.S. inspectors found that a black fibre embedded in a tablet may have been a hair from an employee's arm, according to documents seen by Reuters.That and other quality concerns led the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to impose an ""import alert"" on its Mohali plant last week, saying the factory owned by India's biggest drugmaker by sales had not ensured manufacturing quality.Ranbaxy, which is 63.5 percent-owned by Japan's Daiichi Sankyo Co and gets more than 40 percent of its sales from the United States, did not immediately respond to a request on Wednesday for comment on the FDA observations.The FDA's action has dealt another blow to an Indian generic drug industry battered by a rash of American regulatory rebukes and as U.S. demand for generics grows, especially under President Barack Obama's new healthcare programme.The import alert issued to Ranbaxy prohibits it from making FDA-regulated drugs at the Mohali facility and selling them in the United States until its methods, facilities and controls are in compliance with good manufacturing standards.The unexpected import ban on the Mohali facility sent shares in Ranbaxy plunging by one-third on Monday, and comes just a few months after it pleaded guilty to U.S. felony charges related to drug safety and agreed to $500 million in fines.It brings under sanction all three of Ranbaxy's plants in India dedicated to supplying the United States, and followed FDA inspections in September and December last year.During one of the inspections, the FDA concluded that a black fibre embedded in a tablet was likely either ""tape remnants on the nozzle head of the machine or a hair from an employee's arm that could be exposed on loading the machine"", the documents showed.Ranbaxy had said on Tuesday it would review the details of the FDA import alert and take ""all necessary steps to resolve the concerns"" at the earliest.""The USFDA had conducted inspections at Ranbaxy's Mohali facility in 2012, resulting in certain observations,"" Ranbaxy said in the statement. ""The company believes that it has made further improvements at its Mohali facility ... and remains committed to addressing all concerns of the USFDA."" LATEST BLOWThe Mohali plant, in the northern state of Punjab, had not been making U.S. exports since last November, when it voluntarily recalled its generic version of cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor in the United States due to the potential presence of glass particles in certain batches.The FDA's ban of U.S. shipments from the Mohali plant was unexpected as the facility is relatively new and accounted for 50 percent of new generic drug filings by Ranbaxy, said Sarabjit Kour Nangra, a sector analyst at Angel Broking.The latest action against Ranbaxy came months after the FDA imposed an import ban on one of the plants of Wockhardt Ltd after inspectors found torn data records in a waste heap and urinals that emptied into an open drain in a bathroom six metres from the entrance to a sterile manufacturing area.Wockhardt Chairman Habil Khorakiwala said this month the problem at its Waluj plant was ""an inexcusable lapse, but we have taken swift and definitive action, both corrective and pre-emptive"".India produces nearly 40 percent of generic drugs and over-the-counter products and 10 percent of finished dosages used in the United States. In March, India allowed the FDA to add seven inspectors, which will bring its staff in India to 19.In Ranbaxy's case, the FDA inspections in Mohali also found that a tablet was not within the specified weight limit, the FDA inspectors wrote.Other findings by the FDA included use of dirty glassware, spots and abrasions on the surface of tablets and potential packaging line failure that resulted in unlabeled bottles sent to pharmacies.The latest Ranbaxy import ban and a weak rupee may force Daiichi Sankyo to revise down full-year guidance when it announces first half earnings on Oct. 31, Atsushi Seki, an analyst with Barclays Japan wrote in a report.""It appears Ranbaxy still has problems that need to be resolved,"" Seki wrote.Ranbaxy has lost half its value from its highest level in 2008, when it was first hit by an import ban."
1,WELLNESS,Climbing A Tree Could Be The Key To Happiness,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/happiness-tips_us_5b9d7a2ee4b03a1dcc88812d,"To quantify the mood boost (or lack thereof) of being in nature, MacKerron built an iPhone app called Mappiness that randomly",2013-09-18,Two little boys playing in autumn leaves. One boy is climbing a tree and the other is tossing leaves into the air.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d7a2e26000036007fe40a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Rachel Nuwer for YouBeauty.comFor some two million years our hominin ancestors enjoyed a long-term relationship with Mother Nature. Up until about 10,000 years ago -- a mere hiccup in evolutionary terms -- our survival completely depended upon successfully negotiating her ups and downs. Though we grew apart, man still harbors a meaningful affinity for nature, an adaptive holdover, some scientists say, from prehistoric times.More From YouBeauty: The Beauty Of Rock Climbing Hiking Boots Creativity Beauty Treatments That Relieve StressThough it's been centuries since we began substituting environmental reliance with human wit, researchers believe that nature left a deep evolutionary mark on our psyches. A growing body of scientific evidence links nature with health benefits, including a reduction in stress and disease and a heightened sense of overall wellbeing.Until now, however, how nature affects our experience of immediate, in-the-moment happiness remained a more elusive question. “Most people would agree that natural environments are happier places than other places,” says George MacKerron, Ph.D., a lecturer in economics at the University of Sussex in the United Kingdom. “We know they’re lovely, but ultimately, we wanted to know: How lovely are they?”In other words, can you measure nature's immediate effect on happiness -- right this second? To quantify the mood boost (or lack thereof) of being in nature, MacKerron built an iPhone app called Mappiness that randomly checks in with users twice a day to see what they're up to and how they're doing. Users report whether they're with friends, at the movies, at work, getting ready for bed or doing any of the other countless activities that consume our waking hours. They also share how they feel at the moment by ranking their happiness on a sliding scale, ranging from “not at all” (i.e. hating the world) at one end to “extremely” (utter karmic bliss) at the other.Around 20,000 people installed the app and provided more than 1.1 million data points over a period of six months. The app automatically paired responses with local weather data and GPS coordinates. A computer program classified those coordinates' corresponding nature-y-ness using images taken from Google Earth. “The happiness measure is subjective, but everything else -- the satellite classifiers, the data -- was highly objective,” MacKerron says.Nature did not disappoint. Even after controlling for variables like weather, day of the week, activities and company, natural environments provided significantly more moments of happiness than urban ones, MacKerron and his co-author report in the journal Global Environmental Change. On a scale of zero (least happy) to 100 (most happy), being in nature tended to add an extra three to six points to the baseline average of 66 -- a boost equivalent to the difference between doing housework and going to a museum. Coastal environments ranked highest of the natural settings, especially among women -- along with woodlands and farms. Other activities that prompted a happiness boost of a similar magnitude included hanging out with a partner or friend, and exercising or playing sports. “The best thing is to be in trees with your friends,” MacKerron says.Aside from evolutionary throwbacks, he explains, our affinity with nature may also have something to do with natural environments' relative purity. Navigating amidst honking horns and the reek of rotting garbage on a crowded New York City street is no doubt more stressful an experience than breathing in the sweet air of a forest or meadow. “It's quieter and more peaceful in nature, and also lower in various bad characteristics -- particularly noise and pollution,” MacKerron says. “Perhaps we’re evolved to like natural environments because they’re good for us.”The study does leave some unanswered questions. One of its drawbacks is its geographic fuzziness -- a single tree would not register as nature, for example -- so the researchers cannot say what the minimum green area is that a person needs to feel happier. Nor can they tell how long you have to spend among the trees to reap the benefits. Still, there is hope for urbanites who have access to parks and gardens. Though squarely in the middle of the city, Hyde Park in London registers as a mix of grasslands, trees and water. And lo and behold, people were happier when they were in it.Since most of the people who participated in the study live in urban environments, it's hard to say whether those who live or work in the country get as much of a thrill from basking in the great outdoors as green-starved city dwellers who normally spend their time trapped in a cubicle. Generally speaking, research finds that country folk have higher levels of life satisfaction than city folk, but there are too many factors involved to understand the relationship.The lesson should not be “Green is great, cities are bad,” warns Mirko Moro, Ph.D., a lecturer in economics at the University of Stirling in Scotland who was not involved in the research. “Most people still want to live in big cities,” he points out. “Cities offer the most opportunities to exchange ideas and experience culture.”Rather than ditch your successful career and city friends in favor of a life of bliss in the country, he says, “Whenever you have some time off, just try to go outside in a green space and you’ll probably feel much better.” While a trek to the Catskills or Yosemite would be ideal, an afternoon jogging along the Hudson River or reading in Golden Gate Park should also do the trick. Even the busiest urbanite can still pen a happiness boost into her schedule by taking her next coffee break in the park."

And when I say ""we"" I include myself, as anyone who follows ""Cooking Off the Cuff"" can tell from my summertime posts, which seem to have been about little other than corn and peppers.It's just habit. After all, people eat lots of barbecue and grilled meat on humid 90-degree days, so to say it's about a desire for ""lightness"" is some sort of fallacy of logic that if I'd paid attention in philosophy class I'd be able to name. (Actually, I don't remember ever making it to philosophy class.)There's no reason at all not to eat tender braised or simmered meat and root vegetables in warm weather. It is true that carrots and suchlike hold up very well in winter storage, but it's also true that they're at their peak in spring and summer. It is true too that good pork from good farmers can be had all year round, yet I can't help thinking that when the hogs have spent months on pastureland and rooting around in the woods (as the ones from my go-to pork supplier do) they must taste particularly nice too.I'd previously braised a smallish -- 1-1/2 pounds -- piece of pork belly, though for the purposes of this dish I could also have simmered it in flavorful liquid and certainly could have used a much larger piece and glazed as much as I needed. I browned it lightly; set it aside, poured off some of the fat and added aromatic vegetables, parsley and thyme; when these had softened and begun to brown, I added a whole clove and a whole piece of star anise and deglazed with white wine. Now, I returned the meat to the casserole, added stock (chicken was what I had) not fully submerging the pork, then a tablespoon of good soy sauce. The anise and soy sauce were not there to make this taste Chinese, just to add aroma and savor. I laid a piece of waxed paper over the meat, covered the casserole and cooked it over very low heat for an hour and a quarter, turning the meat after 45 minutes. The pork was tender - if yours isn't, keep going until it is.I let the meat cool in the braising liquid, then removed it to a container and strained the liquid over it before refrigerating. Next day, I removed the congealed fat from the liquid and cut the meat into three chunks. In a pan just big enough to hold the pork with a little elbow room, I browned it on all sides - especially the newly cut surfaces -- and added half an inch of the rich braising liquid. As this simmered, I basted and turned the meat from time to time and added a little additional liquid as needed. This helped to form a glossy, well reduced glaze-sauce. Separately, I did a similar thing with cut-up carrots using a little of the same braising liquid. Why separately? Because I wanted to make sure they were cooked as I wanted them -- tender but not too soft -- and I wasn't sure how long the meat would take. The use of the pork cooking liquid ensured that they'd share flavor with the meat. When the meat was glazed and the carrots nearly done, I added the latter to the former and continued to turn the food in the sauce for another minute or two until the carrots were just right.As it happens, the weather on the night we ate this was not especially summery: the first hints of autumn were in the air. So it didn't seem all that outré to be eating what looked like a hearty stew (and with garlicky mashed potatoes to boot). But because all the ingredients were at their late-summer best, this was even better than it might have been in, say, January. So ditch the salad bowl and get out the braising pan."

According to the Guardian, lawmakers were inspired to take action after realizing France's ""Mini-Miss"" pageant was leading to the ""hypersexualization"" of youngsters.This ban, the first to affect the child pageant industry, has been added to a larger bill meant to protect gender equality and women's rights. If the bill passes, pageant organizers who defy it will face up to two years in prison and a €30,000 fine. While the senate has approved the legislation, the bill will go to a lower house of Parliament for another vote.""Don't let us allow our girls to believe from an early age that their only value is their looks,"" advocate Chantal Jouanno said in Parliament.

After all, models and beauty queens aren't too different -- both are subject to long workdays and intense cosmetic scrutiny that no young girl should face. While France's pageant ban is new, similar regulations have already been put in place to protect models. New York State recently passed a bill to protect child models under the same provisions that apply to child actors. And Vogue UK's Health Initiative, aimed at creating a safe environment for models, includes a ban on models under 16.

When I was 8 (ancient by today's standards), my mother signed my sister Liz and me up for group lessons at Playland Ice Casino in Rye, New York. I quickly zipped through the assigned tests, and the teacher suggested to my mother that I was one of the kids ""with potential"" and should take private lessons before school. That meant at six in the morning.Over the years, I have competed in eight or nine sports: figure skating, women's ice hockey, tennis, squash, triathlons (running, biking, swimming), crew and sex -- if you consider jockeying for position to be a sport!   My father used to stand behind the fence to coach me (that is, scream at me) during my high-school tennis matches and my mother's dinner time refrain was, ""Why can't you be more like Dottie?"" Dottie was Dorothy Hamill, 1976 Olympic figure skating champion. We skated at the same rink every morning before school, and when I went into the locker room to warm my frozen hands over the radiator -- the only heated place in the arena at 6 a.m. -- Dottie diligently kept tracing her figure eights.  Competition, which literally means ""to seek together,"" ran like ice water through my veins. ""Seeking together"" was never the goal. The goal -- and the pathway to my parents' hearts -- was to win. My father was the captain of his Harvard tennis team, my mother, who was raising three children, four years apart, was not happy about seeing her Vassar degree squandered in diapering. (She later went on to earn a Ph.D. in Art History at age 51.) As the oldest of three girls, I was the main repository of my parents' athletic dreams.   At age 10 I was competing in figure skating and tennis. I loved the feeling of hurling myself into the air, doing multiple rotations and landing on a 1/4-inch skating blade. Or later, as an ice dancer, hearing the arena fill with music as I took my partner's arms and we skated off into a waltz, tango, paso doble or quickstep. I loved hearing the thwack when my tennis racket connected with the ball and my father pronounced that I had ""the best forehand in the business.""  But the pressure eventually got to me. I quit tennis when I was in college, not to take it up again until I was 35. When I broke my leg at age 13 on a school ski trip, and could no longer land the jumps, I was relieved. No more comparisons to Dottie. I had always competed in individual sports. But at age 40, I joined the New Canaan Mother Puckers, a women's ice-hockey team that skated at the outdoor rink where I taught figure skating. Learning to skate in hockey skates, and then hold a stick and pass the puck, presented new challenges. Without toe picks on the front of the blade, that first season I ended up on my knees -- praying to the hockey gods that I could get up.  I knew I would never be a star, but I loved being part of a team, knowing that the victories could be shared and the defeats wouldn't fall squarely on my shoulders alone. And win or lose, at the end of the game my teammates and our opponents would shake hands and then go have lunch.  This was the beginning of my mellowing process. I still set athletic goals for myself. Two years ago, I took the Connecticut Challenge and rode my bicycle 54 miles through hilly Connecticut in 104-degree July heat to raise more than $3,500 for cancer survivors. And to celebrate my 60th birthday in July, I took an even bigger challenge -- hiking the Inca Trail in Peru and making it over Dead Woman's Pass (13,776) feet, and down the 3,000 very narrow and very steeps carved into a mountainside by the Incas more than 600 years ago.  Yet sports are now part of a much fuller life than what I had while I was a kid. Now I own a landscape company, teach landscape design and photography at the New York Botanical Garden, judge photography for the Garden Club of America and travel far and wide. And I always make time for my children (who are both in graduate school in California), family and friends. I do know many women who didn't have the competitive childhood that I did, but are now discovering their athletic capabilities later in life. My college pal Kendra ran her first marathon at age 50. And my younger sister, Sally, who was pretty much overlooked by my parents as all their competitive juices were focused on me and my other sister, Liz, ran marathons in her 40s, and also has competed in horse-show dressage events, as well as gone fox hunting in England, where she lives. If you scratch the surface, a lot of middle-aged female warriors emerge.   Now, as I am on the other side of 60, participating in sports mean staying active and feeling fit. For a divorced woman living and working alone, classes at the local YMCA provide an important social connection. I practice yoga to connect my body and my mind through breathing in quieter, more contemplative ways. I also subscribe to the African proverb, ""If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.""   After all these decades, I'm still sweating... still giving it my all and being the best I can be.

On September 16, 2013 a defense contractor named Aaron Alexis, 34, allegedly killed at least 13 people during a shooting rampage at the Washington Navy Yard before being killed by police.

MatthewsIn the aftermath of a shooting that left 13 dead, including the gunman, in the nation's capital on Monday, questions are now being raised about the shooter, Aaron Alexis' mental health. Whether or not the man was in his right state of mind brings up concerns from experts about whether or not we're doing enough to keep mentally-ill individuals away from firearms and receiving proper treatment. The shooter's father told investigators that his son had suffered from post-traumatic stress syndrome following the 9/11 attacks. Not only was Alexis in New York City at the time, his father said his son served as an active participant in search and rescue attempts on the day of the attack. Following this experience, Alexis moved to Seattle where he demonstrated his first documented outburst of violence when he shot the tires in a nearby construction company's vehicle, because, according to the police report, the construction worker had disrespected him. Alexis joined the Navy in 2007, but was discharged after an incident in 2010 when he got into trouble, again for gun violence. He had shot a gun through his ceiling into his neighbor's apartment, which he explained to law enforcement issues as a mistake when cleaning the weapon, but the neighbor countered it may have been an attack. No charges were pressed, but the woman moved out of her apartment.More from Everyday Health: Take Control of Your Depression Quiz: 8 Things You Should Know About High Blood Pressure Daniel Kopans, MD: There Should Be No Confusion About Breast Cancer ScreeningIn the day after the 2010 shooting, other revelations about Alexis' state of mental health surfaced, as law enforcement officials found a report of Alexis calling the Newport Police Department because he said he was being stalked by three people who were keeping him awake by sending vibration to his body, The New York Times reported. Alexis told the police he was hearing voices, but because he had no prior record of mental illness, nothing else was done.While there is no telling whether increased psychiatric help would have resulted in a different fate for the victims of Alexis' Monday rampage, experts did worry that the state of mental health care in the United States needs more support and funding to help care for people like Alexis. This is particularly true of the military health care system, said David Reiss, MD, a trauma and PTSD specialist in the San Diego area.""If you look at the number of people who have PTSD, it overwhelms the system,"" said Dr. Reiss of military mental health care. Reiss emphasized that while there's been a recent trend to use PTSD as a ""general way to refer to any reaction to trauma,"" those suffering from the disease can be living in state of ""intense fight of flight response.""Particularly, there could be more screening for mental health care problems before individuals are cleared to enter the military, said psychiatrist Prakash Masand, MD, professor emeritus at Duke University and president of Global Medical Education. ""Individuals who are at high risk for psychiatric illness do not belong in the military,"" he said.In an additional warning, chilling when considering the violent acts that went unpunished in Alexis' life, Reiss noted that ""the best predictor of violence is previous violence."" Reiss noted that when someone has a seizure, they are placed on a ""do not drive"" list at the DMV, and said he thinks that if someone has either a psychological outburst or any reason to raise concern about whether they're dangerous, they should also be restricted from accessing firearms.While questions have been raised today as to whether Alexis was psychotic, bipolar, or on any sort of drugs, Reiss said this points to an overarching problem in our mental health care system. ""Our mental health system is on the back burner,"" he said, ""and that's not in the best interest of anyone.""Both Reiss and Masand noted that while monitoring mental health more effectively could potentially decrease violent crimes, most violence in society is committed by individuals who are not mentally ill, and only a small portion of the mentally ill do become violent.""Navy Shipyard Shooter's Mental Health Illness: What it Means"" originally appeared on Everyday Health."
