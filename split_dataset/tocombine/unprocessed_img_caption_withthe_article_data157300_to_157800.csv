0,PARENTING,Boston Families Struggle With Lockdown,Catherine Pearson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/boston-parents-lockdown_us_5b9d1099e4b03a1dcc8435b7,"""I said, 'Look, I can tell you, with certainty, that we're safe in our house, but I'm not going to lie to you about the fact",2013-04-19,"CAMBRIDGE, MA - APRIL 19: A lone bicycle rider makes their way across the Longfellow Bridge to Boston from Cambridge while the Boston Area is under lockdown as a manhunt is underway for a suspect in the terrorist bombing of the 117th Boston Marathon earlier this week. (Photo by Jonathan Wiggs/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d10992200005700d97b5b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Joe Corkery and his wife sat their 4-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter down Monday night to tell them about the Boston Marathon bombing earlier that day. They hadn't wanted to, but were worried the children may hear about it from friends who knew that Corkery, 36, had run in the race, crossing the finish line 20 minutes before the bombs went off.On Friday, the family woke to news that the Boston area, including their home in Newton, was on lockdown. For the second time in a week, they would have to discuss a scary situation with their young kids. The police were looking for a person who had set off the bombs, they explained, and were asking everyone to help by staying home and out of the way. ""They were fine with that,"" Corkery told HuffPost. ""They have a lot of questions, though. Like, 'What happens when the police catch him?' My daughter seems to be under the impression that he has to go to the hospital and apologize to everyone, then go to jail for the rest of his life.""Large swaths of Boston effectively shut down on Friday after Gov. Deval Patrick urged residents to stay indoors and lock their doors. Until the lockdown was lifted at 6 p.m., it left parents cooped up and wondering how to best cope with the situation for themselves and for their kids. Steven Meyers, a professor of psychology at Roosevelt University and a Chicago-based clinical psychologist, said a key for parents is being aware of their children's developmental levels. A 6-year-old can be told different things than a 15-year-old, he said.But how parents share news matters almost as much as what they share, Meyers said. Kids of all ages are extremely quick to pick up visible signs of distress. ""Nearly all parents [on lockdown] are going to be alarmed,"" Meyers said. ""However, they need to display as little of that as possible in front of their kids in order to reduce the amount of alarm that the children experience.""It's very hard to do,"" Meyers continued. ""But children interpret the gravity of a situation by looking at the emotional experiences of the adults around them.""One key, Meyers said, is for parents to simply distract their kids, even if it means letting them watch movies or play video games. Meyers suggested parents and kids try deep breathing exercises, and actively divert their thoughts to pleasant or soothing things. There is no shame, he said, in taking their mind off the situation happening around them.That's what Lindsey Mead, 38, of Cambridge, Mass., has been doing off and on all day Friday with her 10-year-old daughter and 8-year-old son. ""I didn't have the TV on for the longest time,"" Mead said, adding that she woke up this morning to the sounds of sirens just a mile away in Watertown. ""Finally I was like, 'I'm dying to know.' So I turned it on, and shoved them out of the room. I put Harry Potter on the computer. They're at Hogwarts.""But Mead also carefully explained why the lockdown was happening.""I said, 'Look, I can tell you, with certainty, that we're safe in our house, but I'm not going to lie to you about the fact that I'm nervous about what's going on around us, and I promise I'll tell you if I find anything out,'"" she said. Joy Budewig Harms said she gave her girls, ages 3 and 4, minimal information about the bombing and the lockdown, because she didn't want someone else to frame the situation for them. They have been holding it together well, she said, even sneaking outside to enjoy a little sun in their yard, as their home in Roslindale, Mass., while locked down, is relatively far from ""the action.""But in a phone call with HuffPost, Budewig Harms broke down at the thought of the lockdown continuing. Her family was supposed to visit their church, just a few blocks from the Boston Marathon finish line, to join a prayer service and see the comfort dogs being hosted there on Friday, but couldn't. She was tearful about the prospect of missing church on Sunday as well, given everything that has happened. But now that the lockdown has ended, her family will be able to go.This article has been updated to reflect the end of the lockdown.  "
1,WELLNESS,Sober Spring Detox Challenge,"Terri Cole, Contributor

Focus on the ice.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d0ff126000035007fb812.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Spring is a good time of year to detox and start fresh. That's what spring is all about, after all -- renewal. So today and in the spirit of the season, I want to talk about showing your liver some love by detoxing. While you may want to detox from caffeine, sugar, fast food, taking certain prescriptions that you may not really need, a sedentary lifestyle, or stress (all of which negatively impact your liver, by the way), I want to specifically talk today about detoxing from alcohol and use my own story as an example. (If you are a committed non-drinker, substitute your vice here.)It all came to a head three months before my college graduation. I had always been a big drinker from a big drinking family, and since college is a time when even non-alcoholics drink alcoholically, my liver was pretty pickled by senior year.I had been seeing a therapist for about a year when she told me she thought my drinking was a problem, to which I defensively exclaimed, ""Well then everyone in my life has a drinking problem,"" to which she calmly replied, ""Well I am not treating everyone in your life, and if you do not seek help with a 12-step program, I will have to terminate our relationship."" Wow! Was my therapist breaking up with me? Holy crap, is it that bad?What I actually felt surprised me -- pure relief.So all gussied up in my '80s finest -- stirrup pants, T-shirt with shoulder pads, gobs of stage light makeup, and an enormous mane of red, permed hair, in full effect with big plastic neon hoop earrings -- I found my way to the basement of a church in Syosset, Long Island. ""Looking good and definitely not like an alcoholic,"" I reassured my rearview reflection before entering.I sat near the door so I could smoke my Parliament 100s considerately. Soon, I was approached by a beautiful, similarly shellacked, big-haired women about 10 years my senior. Noticing I was a newbie, she asked what brought me to the meeting. I said my therapist threatened to break up with me if I didn't attend at least one meeting. To be polite, I asked her the same question. She looked me straight in the eyes and, with a calm that unnerved me, stated, ""I killed a 6-year-old boy in a drunk driving accident.""""Wow, I am so sorry. That seriously sucks,"" was my shocked and insensitive reply.""Yes it does, and I have had to figure out how to live ever day of my life knowing I killed someone's child and broke a mother's heart.""She changed the course of my life.I stayed until the end of the meeting, fighting back a tsunami of tears that threatened to overwhelm me. When I finally got to my car, I was bawling so hard I couldn't drive, so I sat there listening to Whitney Houston's ""The Greatest Love of All"" (which, of course, inspired more bawling) and felt so grateful it hurt. I made a pact with the universal powers that be at that moment that I would not drink again. While I was grateful that the tragic story was not mine, I was keenly aware of how easily it could be. I still think of that generous angel who shared the story that led to the wake up that inspired my transformation.Once I stopped drinking, things changed. I dropped 25 pounds in 30 days, discovered my cheekbones, and moved to New York City after graduation. I took an honest look at all areas of my life. Writing down what I wanted more of and less of in each area. I stayed in therapy and got dialed into the self-empowerment movement. I realized that in order to create the life of my dreams, I had to be brutally honest about what was not working and what limiting beliefs were blocking my potential. The rest is history.Here is a self-awareness opportunity for you if you are up for the challenge:Since becoming a therapist, I inspire my clients (typically not to the severity that my therapist ""inspired"" me, unless it is necessary) to take a 21-day alcohol detox every year around this time.To start, I want to ask you some questions to see if you are more dependent on alcohol than you might realize. When I say I am inviting you to do a 21-day detox, how does that make you feel? Could you do it? Do you want to do it, or is it really the fear of not being able to drink making you say, ""I could, but I don't feel like it?"" If my asking you to not drink for 21 days strikes fear in your heart, I want you to take a look at how much you use alcohol (or another vice) to numb feelings and create a mood-altering experience.So, for the next twenty-one days, will you join me? Since I've not had a drink in about 25 years, I will give up coffee. So, like me, if you're already a non-drinker, pick something else (we all have something!). And don't pick another vice just because you don't want to give up the booze. Only choose something else if you are a committed non-drinker.I'm interested in hearing what these questions and the thought of giving up drinking kicked up for you, so please drop a comment.I hope you have an amazing week, giving your liver some lovin', and, as always, take care of the rest of you too.Love Love LoveTerriFor more by Terri Cole, click here.For more on addiction and recovery, click here."

Why is this not possible? They adopted an iPod into their workout.,2013-04-19,Group of people practising the yoga lotus position,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d100e26000036007fb831.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Half of America exercises at least three or more times a week. I'm not sure why at least half of Americans don't do meditation, considering the benefits. America is one of the most resilient countries in the world; the DNA of this country is made up of people that took risks and came from all over the world. I think Americans need to adopt a practice that's been shown to increase resilience and compassion.Why is everyone in America not using a tool that may make you more compassionate, resilient, kind, and happy?One thing I noticed enormously from the time I started meditation is that the practice has made me a happier and more compassionate person. I'm not perfect, and I'm sure there are people out there who think I'm not compassionate at all, and they are entitled to their opinion. But the reality is it's something I consciously work on because of meditation.I grew up in a culture where most of my guy friends are alpha males who love sports, and work in corporate America. They like to joke around and greet each other with a series of insults. Anyone who observes this would think that it is a comedy show. Now this is not good or bad, this is just a part of the subculture. If you ever go into a locker room of football players in the NFL, you might see a similar subculture.If you would have heard the jokes that were made about me doing meditation, then you would understand where I'm coming from. Outside of the mindfulness and yoga communities in America, meditation is still not mainstream.I admire Dr. Richard Davidson for his pioneering research in the area of meditation. I think programs like the Center for Investigating Healthy Minds at University of Wisconsin-Madison are causing a ripple effect on bringing meditation to the masses. Or the work that Congressman Tim Ryan is doing with promoting the positive effects of meditation.I think the millions of Americans who exercise should be meditating before and after they jump on the treadmill. Why is this not possible? They adopted an iPod into their workout. They should be meditating before work, and they should be doing some meditation during their lunch break to stay focused. Ten years from now, this practice is going to be seen as just like doing a push-up.Here are four ways to make the practice a part of your life:1. At WorkCome up with various ways to incorporate meditation into your work schedule, whether it's before, during, or after work. Try to bring your attention to your breathing whenever you feel stressed out, this can be done at any time throughout the day. Another option would be do it at your lunch break. 2. Before You ExerciseI find meditation to be immensely beneficial to be used before exercising. If you're a runner, try to do at least 10 to 15 minutes of meditation right before you run. Then you can make your run a moving meditation. 3. Right When You Wake UpIf you do meditation right when you wake up in the morning, it will impact every area of your life. Try to do a few minutes of meditation every morning before you start your day. 4. Schedule a Five-Day ChallengeMake a commitment today that you are going to do meditation every day for the next five days straight. Meditation is like anything else -- once you get over the initial difficulties, like trying to focus your mind, it becomes easy.For more by Robert Piper, click here.For more on meditation, click here."
3,WELLNESS,How to Create the Perfect Workout Day,"Heather Bauer, Contributor
Nutritionist, Author, Founder of Bestowed and The Food Fix",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/workout-tips_us_5b9d0f52e4b03a1dcc842380,"Whether you hit the gym first thing in the morning -- or, like me, end your day with a long-distance run -- it is all too easy for us to counteract our workouts by our actions throughout the day.",2013-04-19,Mother with daughter (6-11 months) drinking vegetable smoothie,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d0f522100003300c55e0f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Whether you hit the gym first thing in the morning -- or, like me, end your day with a long-distance run -- it is all too easy for us to counteract our workouts by our actions throughout the day. Keeping your metabolism running after a morning workout, as well as setting up your day with healthy choices before an evening workout, is simpler to achieve then you may think. Changing our eating habits is not the only factor that changes our bodies, however. Switching up your workout routine will give your muscles a challenge. Sticking to the same workout regimen day in and day out not only allows us to be complacent, but forces our muscles to be, as well. Balancing both a healthy diet and diverse workout routine will kickstart your metabolism and get your body into ideal shapeBright and Early: Our mothers were right when they told us, ""Breakfast is the most important meal of the day."" If morning workouts are your choice, eating breakfast is especially important. Breakfast gives us the fuel we need to start the day as well as the energy we need to keep our metabolism up and running. Eating a breakfast high in protein and fiber is a great way to gain energy and start your day. If you are like me, trying to balance a healthy breakfast while also making breakfast for your children can be a challenge. There are many new options available to both satisfy your own needs and give your kids a well-balanced breakfast. One of my favorite new choices out there is Flapjacked. It is a protein pancake mix that is packed with healthy grains like quinoa, as well as eliminates the sugar usually found in most pancake mixes. If your morning workout usually consists of a run around your neighborhood, try switching it up and practicing yoga. There are many videos available to download online and no equipment needed. Yoga helps create a long, lean body with the added bonus of relaxation and meditation that can help you clear your busy mind before you start the day.Mid-Day Boost: Although it may be hard to take time out of your busy day, or sacrifice your lunch hour to workout, it is a great option for people who want to maximize their morning snooze and take care of errands after work. Rather than running to the nearest gym and walking on the treadmill, try taking a class. Classes are usually about 45 minutes and will give you a great workout from a guiding instructor. I love spin classes like Flywheel for a great full-body workout and maximum calorie burn. Always make sure to keep healthy snacks handy after your workout, as well. It is so easy to slip into the pitfall of overeating after a rigorous workout, especially if you are going back to work at your desk. A choice I love that satisfies both the sweet snack craving while also increasing fiber intake is Bobbysue's Nuts. They contain a mixture of almonds, pecans and cashews, with a sweet and spicy kick. Nighttime Nourishment: The last thing we usually want to do at the end of a long day is hit the gym. For many of us, however, this is the only time we have to work out. Instead of heading straight for the elliptical, try grabbing the ballet bar instead. Programs like Physique 57 have produced at-home workouts inspired by ballet bars. These programs combine isometric exercises and stretches to lengthen and sculpt your muscles and create a lean and long body. If you have already fit your workout in during the day, nighttime is best used to unwind. Zeel has developed an app that allows you to book same-day, in-home massages given by their hand picked Zeel Massage Therapists. This is the perfect way to tend to sore muscles that may develop from switching your fitness routine and working out new muscles you may have not normally used.For more by Heather Bauer, RD, CDN, click here.For more on fitness and exercise, click here."
4,WELLNESS,Connected by Catastrophe,"Craig Ing, Contributor
Psychotherapist & Owner of Dont Mind Life",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/compassion_us_5b9d1042e4b03a1dcc842f55,"Why don't we go out of our way, disrupt our daily routines, and demonstrate compassion more frequently?  What is it that makes it so difficult?",2013-04-19,"USA, New York State, New York City, Crime scene barrier tape",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d10422400005000537036.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The events that have occurred this week in the U.S. have been overwhelmingly upsetting. First there were the bombs in Boston, designed to create and send a message of confusion, doubt and fear. Then there was the explosion in Texas. At the time of writing this article I am truly hoping this was nothing more than a horrible accident.In both events, as I watched the various news broadcasts as well as got updates, photos and videos on Twitter, I noticed something remarkable. In fact, so remarkable was it that I was compelled to search the Internet for previous videos and news footage of similar events.Literally moments after the bombs went off, or the explosion had occurred, members of the public, police and other emergency services as well as the countless volunteers (at the marathon) were seen turning and going back into the areas where the bombs had gone off, or running into the fertilizer factory. There was a seemingly instinctive disregard for their own safety. There was an apparent vacuum of clear thought about whether there would be another bomb or explosion. It would appear the only thoughts and actions taking place where those to help other human beings. As strangers lay on the ground or trapped in the building, people scrambled to do whatever it took to reach them and provide whatever comfort they could.The scenes that those people witnessed are usually reserved for the most graphic of R-rated movies. However, that did not stop them. The images will no doubt be in their nightmares and fears for years to come. But they did not think or care about that. These people suddenly had a connection with strangers in a way that only a catastrophe can demonstrate. That connection was at a very basic, primeval level. The connection was not based on politics, trade or desires. The connection was not there because of selfish or material benefit. The basic connection was that of compassion. In my opinion, compassion is more than a feeling or emotion or mindset. In my opinion, it is the very basis for humanity. If we observe the animal kingdom we will always see, in those species built on social structures, members of the species helping those less able, or those in distress. Human beings are also a social species, yet we do not always show any compassion to strangers on the street if we see someone in distress. The sad state of human society is that if we see a person lying in the street, more people will pass by than stop and offer assistance. More people will be either consumed by their own existence or be in fear that person may hurt them or disrupt their life in some way. Whichever, more people choose to ignore than intervene.After watching the incredibly brave, selfless people ignore their own safety for the sake of others, I actually found myself getting frustrated. I was already angry because of the bombs and the explosion. I was already angry that people had died or been injured. And I was already angry because it is so pointless. However, the anger I was feeling was quickly replaced by frustration. I was frustrated that we, human beings, don't display the same compassion on a daily basis towards each other. Worse, is it is becoming seemingly more rare for us to show true compassion to those we confess to love and adore. Those closest to us. Instead, more of us, wrapped in our complex lives with the stresses and pressures that creates, pay lip service to compassion compared to actual physical action.Again, in my opinion, compassion is demonstrated by about a physical action. That action could be sitting alone contemplating and filling your heart with love and positive thoughts about someone or something. Or it can be running back into a blast zone to help strangers.Why don't we go out of our way, disrupt our daily routines, and demonstrate compassion more frequently? What is it that makes it so difficult? The answer is probably in the mindset of the majority of the world's population. I conducted a small but telling survey a few years ago about compassion, and the results were surprising. You see, most people believe that to share and show true compassion to another human being, you need to know that person in some way. I'm not saying the general opinion was that you have to be close to that person, but it was that you do need to know them. You need to know something about them to connect with, that would then allow the compassion to flow.This concept has always been a struggle for me to accept, and certainly in my sessions with every client (athlete, corporation or private individual), I try to realign this belief. By training the mind and heart to establish a relationship without knowing someone is vital. By training the mind and heart that we are all connected -- despite whether our paths have crossed or not -- allows us to be compassionate. If we have instinctive compassion for one another, then we will automatically ""live happy."" If we have instinctive compassion for one another, the anger and fighting will cease.How do we create this instinctive compassion with those we have not met? How do we create a connection that goes beyond the surface of judgement and prejudice? It's actually very straightforward but does take work, training, contemplation so that it embeds into your subconscious and becomes instinctive, automatic.The key to connection and compassion is to understand that we are all actually the same. We have all been born the same way and come into the world the same way, with our mothers. We all need food, shelter and love. We all experience fear. We are all seeking to live happy. We are all the same.It is at this lowest level that we must focus. We must center our attention, our thoughts, our meditations and contemplations on this point, and in so doing, we will establish a connection with every human being. By intensifying this focus, we will create subconscious compassion with each other. It is through this level of compassion that we can truly live a better life, a happier existence, with less or eventually no suffering.Don't let any more time go by without practising instinctive compassion. Do not allow catastrophe to be the catalyst to connect.My thoughts, prayers and love go out to all those affected by the tragedies this week. For those who have passed away and the loved ones left behind, these are events that will take time to reconcile in hearts and minds for everyone. The immediate time ahead will be extremely tough, but know that there is an entire population that is there to support you.For more by Craig Ing, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."

We seek a quiet mind, inner peace.  People of all religions and no religion are making a pilgrimage into silence. They are making a silent retreat.",2013-04-19,A woman deep in thought sitting by the sea. Prayer.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d0c542400003200536ebe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There is a time in life to make a pilgrimage. Let's pack up some belongings, and set out on a path hoping to get a glimpse of what life is all about. There are many pilgrimages with footsteps for us to follow. Pilgrims walk to the mouth of the Ganges in India, circle Mount Kailash in Tibet, or trek toward an ancient chapel in Spain. The pilgrimage calls us to leave modern life and journey into the wilderness of a remote countryside. After enduring lots of weather, tired feet, and spectacular nature, there is inner peace to find and more. Pilgrims quickly realize that in making a pilgrimage, it is also an inner pilgrimage. As dramatic as the outer journey maybe, there is an inner journey which can be equally transforming. Every pilgrimage is a journey where personal limits struggle with nature's terrain, one's own mind, and the silence. The outer adventure of finding our way in a strange land can be a mirror of the inner journey into our psyche. Every pilgrimage is a trek from our civilized identity to a landscape that is something other, something personal, the mystery of trekking around the soul. When asked, ""Why do you make the journey?"" the answer universally is, ""Because the quest itself calls me.""In today's demanding world, a new kind of pilgrimage is being made by many. People in all walks of life are hearing a calling to drop all the gadgets, unplug from all obligations, get away from the noise of daily life. Let's take a journey. Instead of going to Tibet, India, or Spain, an inner pilgrimage calls. We want to get out of the busy world and find freedom from the busy mind. Instead of traveling to some remote part of the world, we seek a remote part of the self. We seek a quiet mind, inner peace. People of all religions and no religion are making a pilgrimage into silence. They are making a silent retreat.When making any pilgrimage there are two schools of thought. There is the ""rough it"" school that physically and mentally challenges the pilgrim, long hours of trekking in harsh conditions. Then there is the nourishing program where the circumstances of the journey are giving and supportive along the way. The thinking behind the bare-bones approach is that the challenges make the pilgrimage. The thinking about the more nourishing journey is that the pilgrim can focus on the pilgrimage itself, the quest. Making the pilgrimage of a silent retreat, an inner pilgrimage, also has two schools. One could be called boot camp for the mind with hour upon hour, day after day of silence and meditation. The concept is that the intensity of the program will discipline the mind and bring clarity. The structure will force awareness to break through the desire to be distracted or comfortable and come to terms with naked awareness. Inner calm and knowing can become available in these circumstances.The second school believes a nurturing retreat relaxes the mind and gives awareness of the heart. This awareness of the heart is where inner peace is found. Hours of meditation and strict discipline are replaced with trust for the pilgrim to make their own retreat, find their own trust as part of self-discovery. In this second school, the love and small joys of the retreat support each person to find the source of love and joy within.Deciding which kind of inner pilgrimage to make is a personal choice. The first school of pilgrimage focuses on a denial of self as a path to finding no self. School two believes fasting to lose weight makes sense. Fasting to find inner peace is like telling a child no dessert, no candy, no play, now enjoy yourself. Or in other words, nurturing ourselves during retreat supports awareness to rest and receive the nourishing peace of the heart.The pilgrimage into silence, nature, meditation touches each pilgrim differently. The first school is centered on mindfulness, watching thoughts to find the space of no thought. The second choice is about heartfulness, quieting the personality and letting awareness rest in the gentleness within. In the depths of the heart is a wholeness, a well of inner peace.In school one or two, in every pilgrimage the wonder begins when the trail seemingly ends. This is when the thoughts stop and awareness is fully present. In this moment there is nothing to depend upon but the journey itself. The presence of the pilgrimage comes forward in our awareness. This is the magic of making a pilgrimage. We are living in the nakedness of the moment. The presence of full awareness, emptiness, and heart essence brings us to something like combining light and grace into a single, unending, vast moment.Regardless which type of inner pilgrimage we make, the inner journey is full of discovery of self and no self. Who are we when identity ends and just awareness rises? The unplugging plugs us into new territory, an inner terrain where nothing is everything, awareness is beauty, an amazing adventure with no boundaries or limit. In a great humility of simple being we want to absorb this essence of goodness, love, joy that is our awareness. Getting out of our routine, traveling into foreign lands is to find a greater landscape, the ground of our potentiality. Making a silent retreat is to make a pilgrimage that can change our life.   An example of pilgrimage of intensive mindfulness meditation is the Insight Meditation Society in Barre, Ma. To experience heartfulness meditation is our Silent Stay Retreat Home & Hermitage near Napa, California.For more by Bruce Davis, Ph.D., click here.For more on the spirit, click here."
6,WELLNESS,Why Everyone Deserves Palliative Care,"Nancy Whitelaw, Contributor
Senior Vice President; Director, Center for Healthy Aging",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/palliative-care_us_5b9d0e5ae4b03a1dcc841782,"The first principle of palliative medicine is to relieve the pain and other symptoms that burden people living with serious illness -- in short, to help people feel better.",2013-04-19,Hospice worker holding elderly man's hand UK. (Photo by: Photofusion/UIG via Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d0e5a2000002d00fdd089.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Life is full of surprises, but statisticians tell us that most Americans who make it to age 65 can expect to live to almost 85, and about 1 in 4 will live past 90. Credit goes to improvements in public health, and to medical breakthroughs that have turned diseases such as cancer from death sentences into chronic diseases. One result is millions of older people with multiple chronic illnesses (heart failure, diabetes, COPD, cancer, and others) who can nonetheless expect to lead long lives. And there's the rub. Now that these conditions typically allow people to live into old age, those same people may find some of their extra years compromised by pain, medical complications, depression, and disability.As Medical Officer of the American Federation for Aging Research, I applaud and advocate for the scientific breakthroughs that make such survival possible. At the same time, as a geriatrician, I see the pain, loss of independence, and stress among vulnerable and frail elders; I believe it is the duty of all health care providers to acknowledge and address these problems, and make their relief a major focus of treatment. One powerful and important response to this paradox is the fast-growing field of palliative medicine. The first principle of palliative medicine is to relieve the pain and other symptoms that burden people living with serious illness -- in short, to help people feel better. Because complex illness thrusts patients into a decentralized and often confusing health care system, palliative care seeks help from many sources, including doctors and nurses specializing in pain control, social workers, chaplains, nutritionists, rehab specialists, pharmacists, and others. In addition to systematically addressing pain, palliative care helps coordinate complicated medical care; helps patients and families clarify their own goals and priorities and understand their treatment options; and offers support, counseling, and community resources to reduce family and caregiver stress -- a serious health risk in its own right. Unfortunately, because palliative care is a relatively new specialty, it is often misunderstood by patients, families, and even some physicians. Five Misconceptions About Palliative Care Misconception #1: If you accept palliative care, you must stop other treatments. This is not true. Our health care system, financed by Medicare, Medicaid, and almost all health insurance plans, now recognizes that many people who are nowhere near death can benefit greatly from the additional support and pain and symptom control palliative care offers, and does not require people to choose.""We need to think about palliative care not as care at the end of life, but as improving a patient's quality of life,"" says R. Sean Morrison, M.D., professor of geriatrics and palliative medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, a Paul Beeson Physician Faculty Scholar in Aging, and director of the National Palliative Care Research Center. ""For the vast majority of patients living with chronic illness, both life-prolonging and palliative treatments are necessary and appropriate.""Misconception #2: Palliative care is the same as hospice. Again, not true. Palliative care should not be confused with the hospice benefit offered by Medicare. Unlike palliative care, hospice does require a patient to be certified, by two doctors, as being six months from death, and does require stopping most curative treatments. Hospice care always remains an option, if and when it becomes appropriate, for people who have received palliative care.Misconception #3: Electing palliative care means you are giving up. In fact, quite the opposite is true. A new perspective and new resources to improve quality of life are provided for the patient.There is every reason to take steps to treat pain, starting with evidence that unrelieved pain may produce mood disorders, notably depression, and can actually hasten death. Choosing palliative care is not about trading time alive for comfort -- it is about trading comfort and time alive for time spent suffering. Misconception #4: Palliative care shortens life expectancy. Again, not true. In fact, important recent evidence now indicates that providing palliative care alongside standard care not only improves many people's quality of life, but also extends their lives. This appears to be true particularly when the palliative care is added early in the illness.An important study of this phenomenon published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2010 studied patients with metastatic small cell lung cancer, a very serious diagnosis that is almost always fatal. All patients had available standard cancer care (surgery, radiation, chemotherapy), and half also got early palliative care. After 12 weeks, the people who received palliative care reported less depression, were less likely to receive aggressive measures such as chemotherapy in their last week of life, and actually lived longer (an average of 2.7 months) than the people who did not receive palliative care.Why did adding palliative care yield such a remarkable result? The truth is, no one knows for sure, and more research is definitely needed and is being conducted. It may be a combination of factors, including more personal attention from physicians and other providers. But, as my friend and colleague, Diane E. Meier, M.D., who leads the Center to Advance Palliative Care and won a MacArthur Foundation fellowship for her pioneering work in the field, wrote in her accompanying editorial with Amy S. Kelley, M.D., ""Perhaps unsurprisingly, reducing patients' misery may help them live longer."" Misconception #5: There isn't much need for a palliative care consultation because my doctor will address my pain anyway. I wish this were true, but for a number of reasons, it often isn't, especially in the case of older patients, who experience disproportionate amounts of unrelieved pain, particularly if they have dementia or other cognitive impairment. Very sick older people may see many doctors, including specialists, and it may not be clear which one is primarily responsible for initiating and delivering palliative care. Access may be a problem, although 8 out of 10 large- and medium-sized hospitals, and all Veterans Affairs hospitals, now offer a palliative care service. More palliative care options are needed for people receiving care as outpatients. Finally, some doctors just are not on board yet, and either regard disease eradication at all cost as their primary duty, or do not want to open the palliative care conversation with patients and families because of their own discomfort or concern about stigma or decreasing hope. In fact, some advocates believe skepticism among doctors is still an obstacle. Reflecting on the lung cancer study in which palliative care increased patients' survival, the deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, Dr. J. Leonard Lichtenfeld, has written, ""If that degree of improvement in life expectancy was seen in a clinical trial looking at survival after treatment with a new chemotherapy drug, there would be applause all over the place. Instead, I fear that many physicians will just yawn and say something to the effect of, 'here they go again with that pain stuff.'""On the other hand, it was doctors, including Diane Meier and Sean Morrison, who looked at the problem of unrelieved pain, envisioned a very different set of possibilities, and launched the field of palliative medicine in the first place. ""Our own suffering as professionals grew out of our distress at how little was being done about the physical, emotional, and existential problems of our patients and their families,"" Morrison says. ""We saw firsthand how well-intentioned but wrong-headed much of the care seemed to be."" Making wise choices about appropriate medical care for an ill older adult is complicated, and only gets more complicated over time. As a geriatrician, my view is that after a certain age, virtually everyone should consider a palliative care consultation. To put it bluntly, the closer you get to your average life expectancy, the more important it is. Second, the health care system needs to do its part: Not only should all patients feel comfortable asking for this help, but all physicians should be trained to talk about it and be able to facilitate, if not deliver it. Finally, all medical institutions should support it. Palliative care embodies many of the core values of geriatrics and, as such, it is simply good care. We know how to do this, and it is time more people experienced the benefits of palliative care.For more by Richard W. Besdine, M.D., click here.For more on death and dying, click here."

In those instances, it's probably pretty obvious something's up with your sleep.But in the case of sleep apnea, a disorder wherein people stop breathing while asleep, sometimes hundreds of times a night, pinpointing the problem can be significantly trickier. These brief periods of breathing cessation don't trigger full alertness, but disrupt sleep enough to leave sufferers groggy in the mornings -- and at risk for a number of more serious health problems, often without even realizing there's a problem.People with undiagnosed sleep apnea -- which may affect more than 20 million adults, according to the American Sleep Apnea Association -- may go on to develop diabetes or depression, and face an increased risk of heart attacks and strokes, among other concerns.Men over the age of 40 are at an increased risk for sleep apnea. Being overweight also increases your likelihood of developing the condition, as can a family history of the disease, having a large tongue or neck and having allergies, sinus problems or any nasal obstruction, according to WebMD.Luckily, there are a number of ways to treat sleep apnea, including simple lifestyle measures like losing weight and avoiding alcohol. But all too often a sleep apnea diagnosis is hard to come by. There's no ""test"" for sleep apnea, and it's not often evident at a doctor's appointment, according to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. A family member or bed partner is often first to notice the signs, usually snoring or brief periods of no breathing.But don't leave your health entirely in the hands of the people sleeping around you. Today, in honor of Sleep Apnea Awareness Day, take a moment to familiarize yourself with these more surprising signs that you could have sleep apnea."

Investigators continue to work the scene of the two bomb explosions at the finish line of the marathon that killed three and injured over a hundred more. (Photo by Darren McCollester/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d0f85240000310094ed68.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Emotional and psychological trauma is the direct result of very unusually stressful events that tend to fracture our sense of safety and security. These events, like the tragic bombings in Boston this week, leave us feeling vulnerable and scared. It rocks our foundation and makes us doubt our previously-held beliefs about feeling secure in our own country. Trauma short-circuits our normal fear response mechanism and spikes it to abnormal levels. So people stay keyed-up and highly anxious all the time. However, following traumatic events, people are affected in different ways and experience a wide range of physical and emotional reactions. There is no right or wrong way to be experiencing such a horrific event.The symptoms people typically experience after an event of this magnitude are flashbacks (vivid reproductions of the event) or the recurrent re-experiencing of the trauma, frightening memories, nightmares. They experience numbness or an emotional disconnectedness to others. They are easily startled, they experience hypersensitivity, edginess, irritability, difficulty concentrating, excessive worry, fearfulness and avoidance of places, things, people and anything that reminds them of the trauma. For example, the name Boston or the word ""marathon"" or the specific date that it occurred may induce an emotional negative resonance for quite some time. When they hear or experience these associations to the events, it's like opening up the wound again and re-experiencing it all over again. Specifically, in the direct aftermath of a traumatic event, oftentimes people suffer what is called acute stress disorder (ASD). But consequently, most of the time this will escalate into a more common condition called post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a very invasive psychological disorder that negatively affects the neurological system of the brain. It may develop after a traumatic experience that involves actual threatened death and/or threat of serious personal injury or that involves witnessing threatened death and serious personal injury to others. When to Seek HelpIf you are having trouble functioning at home or work and you see you have impairment in your ability to perform daily routines and tasks of daily living. If you have excessive worry, panic attacks and symptoms of depression, isolation, emotional numbness and many of the symptoms mentioned above, you may want to seek professional help.Get counseling from trained professionals in trauma therapy and grief and loss therapy. There are excellent treatments out there today that are very effective. And remember, grief is a normal reaction to abnormal events -- the more you talk about it, the better you get. There are many different kinds of trauma therapy. But most involve the process of debriefing the account of the event via verbal communication with a trauma specialist. This helps to gradually de-catastrophize the experience and begin to reduce the severity of the symptoms. The debriefing or reviewing of the account also helps to restructure thoughts by re-authoring and re-interpreting the account with new language and new images. Over time, these techniques help to stabilize individuals and restore emotional stability again. In addition, don't rush or try to accelerate the process of healing. This may be a long road that needs to run its course. Also, initiate self-care, give yourself compassion. Try to do kind things for yourself one time per day. Surround yourself with loved ones and allow yourself to receive the support that you need. This is not a time to try and go at this alone. Also, try to reestablish some kind of normalcy in your life, do everyday tasks, but break the tasks into small ones. This will help to inspire reassurance and solidity again in your life. Avoid alcohol and illicit drugs as a way to self-medicate.For more by John Tsilimparis, click here.For more on mental health, click here."

While I was scrolling through my iPhone reading about the horrific event that occurred at the Boston Marathon, one of my friends sitting across from me pointed at my iPhone case, which says ""life is beautiful,"" and told me it may be time to take that case off. I was already feeling sick about the news I was reading, and this comment almost made me burst into tears because for a second I thought maybe the world really is just done being a good place. But it's not, and the city of Boston continues to prove that. Boston is a city known for its beauty, history, and pride. It is known for its outstanding colleges and universities and is home to the best hospitals in the country. Boston is known for its elite sports teams and its world-renowned marathon. Boston will never stop being known for all of these things because another thing Boston is known for is its ability to move forward and fight through challenges.Boston is home to amazing people. Yes, John Adams, JFK, Matt Damon, Conan O'Brien, Dane Cook, and James Taylor are just some of them. But these are not the people I am talking about. I'm talking about all of the Bostonians that take the T to work every day, the fans who stick by the Red Sox, Patriots, Celtics and Bruins no matter the score, the college students who fell in love with their new home, the athletes who run the Charles River every afternoon, and all of the Bostonians who have trouble pronouncing their R's.All of these amazing Bostonians have come together more than ever this week with heavy hearts but hope in their eyes. It is not fair that this happened, but sometimes terrible things do happen and it forces us to look at the good around it. The courage and compassion of the first responders help us remember that no matter what in the world goes wrong, there are still heroes all around us. The men and women who ran into the scene of the explosions, risking their lives to help save another, is an act that shows just how strong this community is. The ability for complete strangers to come together as one during times of crisis is something that is larger than life. People that normally would walk by each other without even looking at one another were crying together, holding each other, offering words of comfort, taking the shirts off of their backs to wrap someone's injury, carrying strangers to safety. This is the thing about tragedy; it has an incredible way of bringing people together. Boston has come together as one to mourn the losses, pray for the injured, and stand by their beautiful city. Next time you're stuck thinking we live in a world filled with sadness and hate, think of all the hope and strength that the people of Boston have displayed. Boston will always be strong. Boston will always be resilient. Boston will always be the land of the brave. My thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved in the Boston Marathon bombing.For more by Shelby Doherty, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."

The lunch box is even more challenging! As passionate as I am about healthy eating, I still find it a struggle to create healthy lunches that my kids will actually eat. So, I asked parents to share their healthy lunch ideas. Together with Kelly Lester of Easy Lunch Boxes, I launched The Healthy Lunch Challenge. Moms across the country shared their ideas for how to build a better lunchbox on a busy parent's schedule. It turns out there are a few simple food rules to follow:  The same principles that we use playing Crunch a Color to build balanced, healthy dinners can be used in your lunch box. Use the Crunch a Color formula: three colors + one protein + one healthy grains. I love how Jill of Meet the Dubiens packs her boxes with a riot of color!  How do you balance busy with healthy? Make it easy! Assemble a stable of recipes featuring healthy ingredients that can be whipped up in a flash. Marla Meridith at Family Fresh Cooking is masterful at dishing up easy, family fresh ideas. Her Giddy Up Pasta was a huge hit at our house. Another way to make it easy? Leftovers for lunch! Brenda at Meal Planning Magic shows us how, along with a few more time saving tricks. School lunches can be the worst offenders when it comes to processed foods. One of the keys to building a healthy lunch is to ""Think Out of the Box"" and remake those boxed favorites in a healthy way. Start by tackling chicken nuggets, Bent on Better Lunches style! To make it even better, choose organic meats raised without antibiotics. I think my kids have (max) three go-to recipes for their lunch boxes. That definitely qualifies as a recipe rut! And it's a dramatic contrast to the 52 New Foods we tried last year, which makes me even more motivated to make a change. Break out by trying a new food each week in your lunch. The creative Keeley McGuire shows us a fun way to try Brussels sprouts. ""If they cook it, they will eat it!"" That's true for the lunchbox too. One of the keys to getting kids to eat their healthy lunches is to get them making their own healthy lunches. Let them create a meal plan for the week. Get them into the act of preparing their own recipes. How about DIY almond butter pizzas from Organized Bites? Remember, the key is to make it fun! Cut a few veggies into fun shapes like Deb at iPackLunch. Or put it on a stick like Kendra at Biting the Hand that Feeds You (it's always more fun on a stick!). Pop a few conversation starters or a love note in your box for a little surprise. It doesn't take much time, but it's way more fun (for you and your kids)!A word about allergies: Many families face the challenging (and scary) reality of food allergies. Although my kids do not have food allergies, their school is 100 percent nut free so I'm always looking for easy ways to banish peanut butter from our boxes. Healthy no-bake cookies made with sunflower butter are the current favorite in our house, and they are a breeze for kids to make. We've also got a few lunch buddies who avoid gluten, which means we're happy when we find an easy gluten free alternative to our favorite lunch box treats! Check out Amy The Family Chef for a few more ideas. Now you're stocked with healthy lunch ideas! Get out there and have fun building a better lunch box with your kids. Post your pictures on Twitter, Facebook or Pinterest. We'd love to sneak a peek at what you're packing!

As young people in our 20s, we have so many responsibilities and obligations that we often neglect to fuel our bodies, and subsequently our minds. And our bodies are all we have! So it is so important to nourish and care for ourselves properly. New York is the city that never sleeps. People are out at all hours on a weeknight and the 24- hour diner has its own speed-dial on your phone. This is New York, people -- take it or leave it. Although this sounds like a dream come true, it can be difficult to stay on track while constantly surrounded by so much temptation. From frozen yogurt on food trucks to pop-up pizza stations, food is everywhere, and defines the social scene in New York City. It brings people together, but can also be a source of personal contention and conflict. You shouldn't have to stay home just because you fear you will succumb to the breadbasket or that pitcher of margaritas. It's okay -- we've all done it once or twice. And you shouldn't feel guilty! You most likely had fun, and that's what makes life interesting. However, when this becomes a regular occurrence, the pants start to get a little tighter. I have always felt that the key to staying afloat in this city of great temptation is moderation and preparation. Both in life and in food, these two notions are front and center in my personal New York City survival guide. In the realm of nutrition, I believe that moderation truly stems from preparation and planning. You get what you give. So essentially, it goes back to what you learned all those years ago from your rigid elementary school teacher -- prepare, prepare, prepare. Start with small changes, such as keeping high-protein, portioned-out snacks on hand to keep energy levels up and to help avoid that delivery of Magnolia cupcakes sitting at your office's reception desk. If you prepare before, you are less likely to give into temptation later. From a personal and professional standpoint, I'm well aware that this is a ubiquitous challenge for most individuals. If it were so easy to just plan ahead, lose weight and maintain it, the nutrition field would be much smaller (and a lot less lucrative). Integrating a more mindful and cognizant approach to eating does not occur overnight -- it takes time and effort, just like anything else. If you enjoy cooking, prepare meals for the week over the weekend when you are relaxed and have time. If you first begin preparing the next day's lunch after a long and exhausting day at the office, you will become frustrated and lose motivation in making this a priority. For those kitchen-challenged folks, don't fret; New York serves up a bodega or market on every street corner where the preparation is done for you. It may be pricier, but there is an abundance of waistline-friendly options at every turn. I also highly recommend keeping a food log or journal. Now, this doesn't mean walking around with a pen and notepad writing down every bite of food you consume. That would be tedious and ineffective. This is 2013, people. There are great, free smartphone apps such as MyFitnessPal and Lose It, which make tracking calories fun and easy. Keeping a dietary record helps you become more aware of the types of foods you are eating at specific times of day, while adhering to an appropriate caloric range. Try tracking for a week and see if it's beneficial. Maybe seeing that bottle of wine in concrete writing will urge you to stick to one glass next time. Eventually these small behavioral changes will become habitual and routine. You will stop stressing about menu options and fearing that dining out will sabotage your 6 a.m. spin class regimen. You will stop overeating at meals, begin to recognize when you've had enough and actually walk away satisfied -- not stuffed, uncomfortable and regretful. My point is, with all of our other daily stressors, food doesn't have to be one of them. Eating well should make you look and feel good -- it should benefit your life instead of hindering it. We often overlook the fact that food is enjoyable, if approached with the right mindset. Begin implementing small changes and see if you feel more confident when it comes to your ability to take control and self-monitor. After all, who wants to miss Margarita Monday with outside seating?

One of the things he really helped me see was how much thinking I had around the concept of ""rejection"". Here's an analogy he shared that really struck me:---Imagine a friend of yours receives an extraordinary offer from an eccentric millionaire. This mysterious benefactor sets a timer for 10 minutes and hands your friend a coin. Each time your friend flips the coin in the next 10 minutes and it comes up ""heads,"" he will receive $1,000.The timer starts, but to your surprise, your friend doesn't immediately start flipping the coin. Instead, he stares off into the distance as if to psych himself up for the task at hand. Finally, after almost two minutes of deep breathing and intense concentration, your friend flips the coin for the first time -- and it comes up ""tails."" To your chagrin, he doesn't just pick up the coin and flip it again. Instead, he glares at it on the ground as if it has somehow betrayed him. A full minute later, he picks the coin up and, with a grimace on his face that could be fear, sadness, anger, or all three, he eventually flips the coin again -- and again it comes up ""tails.""Nearly four minutes have now passed, so you decide to offer your friend some encouragement. ""All you have to do is just keep flipping the coin and you'll make thousands of dollars!"" you enthuse. ""You don't understand,"" your friend says sadly. ""I've got ""tails"" twice now -- that's $2,000 I've lost and I'm running out of time.""""That doesn't matter,"" you say, almost shouting. ""You've still got plenty of time! Just keep flipping!""""That's easy for you to say,"" your friend says. ""You don't have the life experience I've had. When I was a little kid, I flipped ""tails"" auditioning for the school play and I wound up being the third tree on the left in the forest scene. Then, when I was a teenager, I had the chance to go to the big dance with my dream date, but I flipped ""tails"" and wound up having to go with my cousin. And don't even get me started on all the ""tails"" I flipped when I tried getting a job after graduation... I just can't face getting ""tails"" again -- it's all too much!""Nothing you say seems to make an impression on your friend, and you watch in amazement as he stands, sullen, coin in hand, watching the timer count down to zero without ever flipping it again.---We can easily see our friend's foolishness -- after all, no matter how many times he flipped the coin and it came up ""tails,"" the next flip could still come up ""heads."" Over time, even with some bad luck, he could have easily made tens of thousands of dollars.But what we fail to see is that each time we turn the word ""no"" into a story of rejection, betrayal, injustice, or karmic retribution, we are acting just like that would-be coin flipper. Our story of ""no"" paints us into a corner where we are too afraid to even ask for what we want, be that a job, a sale, a date with our dream lover or even a date with destiny.The truth is, ""no"" doesn't mean we are a bad person or doomed to failure. It's not evidence of a conspiracy against us by the fates or proof that our parents/teachers/siblings were right about us and we never will amount to anything.It just means ""not yes."" That's it. ""Not yes.""What's so scary about ""not yes""?If we don't have a story about it, not much. In fact, it's no more scary or meaningful than flipping a coin and having it come up ""tails."" Without our story of ""no,"" we're free. In fact, we always have been.I find it interesting that if you flip a coin 100 times in a row and it comes up ""tails"" every single time, the odds of it coming up ""heads"" on the 101st flip are still only 50 percent. Random chance doesn't keep score. And if you want asking for what you want to be as easy as flipping a coin, you don't have to keep score either. You can simply ask, and ask, and ask again. And sooner or later, someone will always say ""yes.""With all my love, michaelFor more by Michael Neill, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."

Fucking horrible."" More than 252,000 people liked Patton Oswalt's Facebook update regarding Monday's horrifying Boston Marathon attack. More than 48,000 people clicked ""like"" on The Huffington Post's reprint thus far. Obviously, Patton Oswalt's sage words are helping many to heal from the intense pain of yet another senseless act of terrorism (domestic or otherwise). And I so want to feel uplifted by their optimism that we're a ""giant planet and we're lucky to live on it,"" that we need to focus on the ""people running TOWARDS the destruction to help out"" and that ""the vast majority stands against that darkness."" However, I am finding myself feeling sad, even cranky. I've got battle fatigue, despite that I haven't left New York all week. Maybe it's the rapid onslaught of violence that seems to have escalated in the past decade, if not just the past year. Maybe I'm just feeling negative for personal reasons (my father passed away just two weeks ago from lung cancer). But here's the rub: I am not at all certain that the good people on this planet ""dilute and weaken and eventually wash away the evildoers and, more importantly, the damage they wreak."" No. I am not certain of that at all. I have no doubt that Oswalt is correct in his statement that we can look ""violence, or bigotry, or intolerance or fear or just garden-variety misogyny, hatred or ignorance"" in the eye and think, ""the good outnumber you, and we always will."" It feels good to say so. Really good, in fact. Just like it felt good when I was watching Schindler's List and marveling at how a just a few good people intercepted the commission of unspeakable evil, at least on a small scale (at this point in time, Poland has still never fully recovered its Jewish population). However, like Oskar Schindler mourning the fact that it ""wasn't enough,"" I mourn the very real possibility that the forces of good being greater than the forces of evil may simply not be enough. I wish I could be cheered by the notion that the sheer numbers are in favor of ""good."" I wish I could see the ""good"" as ""white blood cells attacking a virus."" But instead (and granted, maybe this is the fallout from my father's recent death), I see a tiny, virulent cancer cell with the capacity to ravage a healthy body into carrion. The capacity of one bad ""cell"" cannot be underestimated. While I wish I could jump on the ""the good shall overcome"" bandwagon, I am exhausted from the fight.I lived in New York City on Sept. 11, 2001. I lost friends, friends lost spouses, children lost parents, and parents lost children. But I never lost faith in humanity, not even for one moment. What I did recognize is that life is precious, that it can be destroyed by a lack of humanity and that good does not always overcome evil. At least that's what the current scorecard says. I listened in horror to the news the day that one of the first responders from the Oklahoma City bombing committed suicide. A month or so after the Aurora, Colo. movie theater massacre, I let my teenage sons go to the movies again. At first, I didn't want them to go to movies that depicted violence, because in some desperate attempt to impose order on chaos, my mind tried to connect the shooting with movie violence. Then after the December 14 massacre of first- and second-graders and their teachers in a quiet elementary school in a bucolic suburb not even an hour's drive from me, I realized that whether my kids went to the midnight showing of Batman or Sunday's Disney matinee, I couldn't feel safe because nothing was safe anymore. And all it took was one bad person. I ran in the New York City Marathon three times in the 1990s. When I heard the news on Monday, a part of me breathed a sigh of relief that I could never run fast enough to qualify to run the Boston Marathon. Then I laughed at my folly. Was that what kept me out of harm's way on Monday? Or is it something else? If so, then why didn't something keep 8-year old Martin Richard out of harm's way? Why wasn't the essential goodness of an 8-year old child enough to overcome the evil that day? Why wasn't the essential goodness of 500,000 race participants (whether as runner or spectator) enough to overcome one small cell of evil?I certainly don't fault Patton Oswalt for speaking the kind words that comforted so many, or inspiring perhaps hundreds of thousands of people with the notion that there is still hope for our planet because good does outnumber evil. It's not Oswalt's fault that I am not comforted. It's not his fault that I feel intense pain at the idea that someone who lost both of his legs on Monday may have just run 26 miles with those legs. That has nothing to do with Patton Oswalt, and it doesn't take away the essential truth of what he wrote, which is that there are so many many more good people than bad.But I can't help but want something more. I feel unsatisfied. I don't feel soothed. Perhaps the problem is that I don't want to be soothed? Perhaps the idea that I might feel better tomorrow or the next day frightens me because I suspect that being soothed may simply lay the groundwork for another ""shocking"" attack. I have heard people call for the death of whomever planted the bombs, and I know that the thought of harsh justice provides comfort to some. I have comforted myself at times by wishing upon the perpetrators a different form of justice -- one that might be worse than death: a life behind bars without ever seeing the sun, a life without family and with no hope for martyrdom. I have comforted myself at times by imagining that somehow the perpetrators will someday feel remorse and that the victims and their families will someday find peace. But the comfort does not last. What I really want is for the evil to stop. Will it stop because there are more good people than bad? I'm sorry, but I just don't think so. It has never worked that way, at least not to my knowledge. What I want is reason to believe that someone is thinking about new ways to end the violence, and that whomever is thinking about it has the power to put a workable plan into effect. It won't be a plan that involves multiplying the number of good by killing off all the bad or by moving the bad to an island or another planet. Instead, it will be a plan that takes into account the nature of evil, and how and why one apple can spoil the whole barrel. I wish I had the answers. And I wish that my words could comfort hundreds of thousands the way the words of Patton Oswalt have. I won't pretend that these words of mine will comfort anyone. But what I wish is that we all give some critical thought to what our vast number of good people can do to vanquish the small but destructive force of evil.For more by Lauren Cahn, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."
