The baby kale has a wonderful texture that stands up to the bold cayenne-spiked vinaigrette. The carrots have a bit of crunch too -- but also a lovely sweetness to them. The kumquats, on the other hand, are deliciously zesty, while the sesame seeds are delicately nutty, as well as visually appealing.Here's a salad that's equally as enchanting to the taste buds as it is to the eyes!Baby Kale Salad with Purple Carrot Ribbons, Kumquats and Sesame VinaigretteServes 4 Active time: 20 minFor the vinaigrette 1 tablespoon tahini 1 tablespoon brown rice vinegar 1 tablespoon low sodium Tamari soy sauce 2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil 2 tablespoons almond or grapeseed oil 1/2 teaspoon organic sugar 1/8 teaspoon sea salt 1/8 teaspoon ground cayenneFor the salad 3 medium purple carrots (or regular carrots) - peeled 5 oz (140 g) baby kale - rinsed and spun dry (see cook's note) 10 kumquats - halved lengthwise (or 1 orange, peeled to the flesh, halved and cut crosswise in 1/4"" slices) 1 tablespoon black sesame seeds (or regular sesame seeds) - toasted (see cook's note)Step 1: To make the vinaigrette - Place all the ingredients in the bowl of a small food processor and process until well blended, about 30 seconds. Set aside.Step 2: Slice the carrots lengthwise with a vegetable hand peeler to form ribbons. Set aside. Place the kale in a large bowl and drizzle with two thirds of the vinaigrette. Toss until well coated. Divide the kale amongst four plates or salad bowls. Dot with the kumquats. Top each salad with a small mound of the carrot ribbons. Drizzle with the balance of the vinaigrette and sprinkle with the sesame seeds. Serve immediately.Cook's note 1: If you can't find baby kale, you can use regular kale for this salad. Tear the leaves in 3"" pieces and discard the tough stems. Baby spinach, arugula or tatsoi are good substitutes.Cook's note 2: To toast the sesame seeds - Heat a small frying pan over medium heat. Add the seeds and cook for 3 minutes until fragrant, tossing frequently and taking care not to burn them. If cooking with regular sesame seeds, cook until the seeds are golden."
1,FOOD & DRINK,"Cooking Off the Cuff. Or Rather, Not Cooking at All","Edward Schneider, Contributor

Some of those ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d8ef826000035007fec25.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Jackie and I have been traveling, so there's been no home cooking for a couple of weeks and won't be for another week or so.But that doesn't mean I haven't been thinking about cooking. One of the benefits of eating in restaurants is that you can pick up ideas -- big ones and little ones -- about what to cook for dinner once you get home.Here are some ideas that could find their way into my home kitchen and perhaps into ""Cooking Off the Cuff.""This first group is from the excellent Restaurant As in Amsterdam. To start, a light and refreshing cocktail! When asked what we wanted to drink, we said ""Something Dutch,"" which wasn't the expected answer at all. The chef-owner, Sander Overeinder, thought for a moment and returned with a little young Dutch gin (genever), even less elderflower syrup and lots of seltzer, plus plenty of ice. Subtle, aromatic, refreshing and mood-setting. I've already bought myself a bottle of elderflower cordial, so we can have this drink as soon as we get home. (I'll probably use regular gin, not genever.)At Restaurant As, they cream together butter and buttermilk with a tiny bit of salt. This was a great spread for great bread: light, slightly fermented-tasting, but still recognizably butter.They also shave raw Jerusalem artichokes into thin slices and use them to top carpaccio (here of venison, but it would be great with beef). They look like the cheese shavings (I'll be using parmesan, not the aged Netherlandish goat cheese they use at the restaurant), but have a mild flavor and snappy crunch. Kind of like water chestnuts.A final idea: Restaurant As has a wood-burning oven, and they take advantage of its smokiness in many ways. One was to cook leeks: they're roasted in their outer leaves for a very long time; they become very tender and limp with a smoky flavor and a built-in sauce-like juice once you've stripped off the outer layers. And again, they taste of what they are, plus. I'm not sure how I'll approach this one. Clearly, the smoke will have to go but the notion of long-roasted leeks is an appealing one. There were, of course, more restaurants and more ideas. There'll be another small selection of them next week, I expect, unless I find myself a kitchen in London."

Culture and traditions in different countries also dictate what types of foods generally are considered delicacies, and so while people in China may enjoy chicken feet, many Americans would shrug away a plate of these crispy bites. But with some foods and drinks, it is more than just a question of preference: Countries all over the world have their own lists of edible items that are banned from being imported or consumed.Click Here to see 10 Banned Foods and Drinks in AmericaThere has been much talk about the U.S. government allowing Americans to consume ingredients that are banned in other countries, many of which are potentially harmful to our health. But on the other side of it, there are several food items other countries happily eat, which in the United States are put on the ""No"" list. Click Here to see The 35 Best Tacos in AmericaFederal and state governments in the States have either fully or partially banned several items, some of which might seem obvious -- like the deadly Japanese blowfish -- while others, quite surprising. Until this year, the popular European Kinder Surprise toy-filled chocolate egg was banned in the U.S., as the government thought the hidden toy was too dangerous for children. The legality of other items is still being debated: Formerly banned horse meat is slowly finding its way back to the legal side of meat industry, while the sought-after delicacy foie gras has been banned in California.- Elsa Säätelä, The Daily MealMore Content from The Daily Meal:11 Banned Ingredients We Eat in America The 101 Best Restaurants in America 10 Iconic Recipes That Define America The 35 Best Pizzas in America"
