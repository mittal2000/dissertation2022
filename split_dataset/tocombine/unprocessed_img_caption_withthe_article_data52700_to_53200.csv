0,POLITICS,Democratic Party Endorses Abolishing The Death Penalty -- Breaking With Hillary Clinton,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democratic-platform-death-penalty_us_5776d56de4b0a629c1aa0984,"The party platform says it’s time to end the practice, even though the presumptive nominee still supports it.",2016-07-01,"""I do think there are certain egregious cases that still deserve the consideration of the death penalty,"" Hillary Clinton said in October.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5776d5ba1500002a006c9597.jpeg?cache=99VSSiVNgW&ops=crop_0_36_3333_1864%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"The draft of the 2016 Democratic Party platform endorses abolishing the death penalty, a break with the views of its presumptive presidential nominee. ""We will abolish the death penalty, which has proven to be a cruel and unusual form of punishment. It has no place in the United States of America,"" reads the document, which the Democratic National Committee released Friday afternoon.The 2012 platform did not call for an end to capital punishment, instead saying that ""the death penalty must not be arbitrary.""The position in the new platform is at odds with what Hillary Clinton has said she supports. In October, she acknowledged significant issues with the way the punishment has been used, but said it should not be ended altogether. “We have a lot of evidence now that the death penalty has been too frequently applied, and too often in a discriminatory way,"" she said. ""So I think we have to take a hard look at it.""""I do not favor abolishing it, however, because I do think there are certain egregious cases that still deserve the consideration of the death penalty, but I'd like to see those be very limited and rare, as opposed to what we've seen in most states,"" she added. In March, she said she would ""breathe a sigh of relief if either the Supreme Court or the states, themselves, began to eliminate the death penalty."" But, she added, she believes it still has some value right now on the federal level.""Where I end up is this, and maybe it is distinction that is hard to support, but at this point, given the challenges we face from terrorist activities primarily in our country that end up under federal jurisdiction for very limited purposes, I think that it can still be held in reserve for those,"" she said, citing the Oklahoma City bombing as an example. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Clinton's competitor in the primary, opposes capital punishment. A Clinton campaign spokesperson emphasized that the platform ""represents diverse views across the democratic coalition,"" even though in some cases, such as on the death penalty, the ""presumptive nominee has a slightly different position.""The platform is a compromise document between Clinton and Sanders supporters. Sanders received an unprecedented amount of say in the platform when the Democratic National Committee allowed him to name five members to the 15-member committee. Hillary Clinton chose six, and DNC Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.) picked four. The committee -- both Sanders and Clinton appointees -- approved the death penalty provision, with only one abstention by a DNC appointee. The draft now heads to the full 187-member platform committee for approval on July 8 and 9 in Orlando. It will then be ratified on the floor of the convention in Philadelphia.This piece was updated with comment from the Clinton campaign."

No organization claimed responsibility.Tsarnaev is being held at the ""Supermax"" high-security prison in Florence, Colorado, while his attorneys appeal his death sentence.Legal wrangling over Tsarnaev's fate could play out for years or even decades. Just three of the 74 people sentenced to death in the United States for federal crimes since 1998 have been executed. (Reporting by Mostafa Hashem; Writing by Amina Ismail; Editing by Andrew Roche)"

""Two representatives of the General Confederation of Labor union (CGT) could have gone years without coming to work,""Jerez de la Frontera town hall said in a statement posted to its website on Wednesday.""According to a written statement by the men themselves, this situation could date back 15 years,"" it added.The pair's dismal work ethic first came to light after the authority's human resources department started probing staff labor records, El Pais reports.They initially discovered the duo had not worked a single day from January 2015 to the date of the inquiry in May 2016. Further investigations revealed they'd been skipping work since at least 2001.A representative for the men's union, the CGT union, claimed the employees had done nothing wrong. He cited a ""tacit agreement"" with previous councilmen that allowed union members to take off ""accumulated days"" and to share the vacation days of colleagues, per 20 Minutos.One of the men has since returned to work. Both face disciplinary proceedings. It’s unclear what penalty they may face, as the investigation continues.Investigators also discovered several members of the town's SIP local police union were also not working as hard as they should have been. In 2015, One employee was found to have worked for just 96 days, another for 66 days and a third for 47 days.The employees claimed they were attending meetings, but investigators found these events never took place, according to the municipal government's statement. ""In some cases it is curious that they claimed to have had these meetings on public holidays, obviously without it taking place at all,"" the town hall's statement added.Despite the potentially damaging revelations, the authority claimed the issue of staff not attending work was not endemic. The local government vowed to do all it could to stop the practices. ""This government again confirms its decision to end the irregular labor situations that may have been happening for some time within the breast of the town hall,"" its statement added.The revelations come just five months after it emerged that a building supervisor in nearby Cadiz similarly went six years without showing up for work. He was caught out after getting an award for two decades of service."

Concerns about immigration and jobs featured prominently in that referendum, as they did in Austria's knife-edge election.Norbert Hofer of the anti-immigration FPO lost the May 22 vote to former Greens leader Alexander Van der Bellen by less than one percentage point, or around 31,000 votes in the race for what is largely a ceremonial position.The court found more than twice that number of postal ballots had been affected by breaches of the electoral code.""It is absolutely clear to the Constitutional Court that laws governing an election must be applied rigorously,"" the court's 14 judges said in their ruling on a challenge brought by FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache.The re-run will reopen a debate that split Austria almost evenly, pitting town against country, and blue-collar workers worried about immigration and falling living standards against the more highly educated.Witnesses told the court of various irregularities in the way postal ballots were counted.These included ballots being processed before the officially ordered start the morning after the election, and counts being carried out in the absence of party observers, often because officials were racing to provide a result quickly.The court found no proof that the result had been manipulated but the possibility that the outcome might have been affected is enough for a challenge to succeed.The irregularities that have come to light have dismayed the Austrian public.""There was sloppiness,"" Austrian Interior Minister Wolfgang Sobotka, whose ministry oversees elections and was accused by several witnesses of applying pressure on officials to provide a rapid count, told reporters after the verdict.The government must now choose a date for the election.How the outcome might change in a European political climate overshadowed by the Brexit vote is unclear - the referendum could buoy populist sentiment or have a chilling effect on it.(Reporting by Francois Murphy and Kirsti Knolle; Editing by Kevin Liffey)"

The agency is currently monitoring 287 pregnant women with any laboratory evidence of Zika infection, not including those in U.S. territories such as Puerto Rico.Zika has caused concern throughout the Americas due to an alarming rise in cases of the birth defect known as microcephaly and other severe fetal brain abnormalities linked to the mosquito-borne virus reported in Brazil, the country hardest hit by the outbreak. Infants with microcephaly tend to have abnormally small heads and may experience potentially disabling developmental problems.Brazil has confirmed more than 1,400 cases of microcephaly in babies whose mothers were infected with Zika during pregnancy in the current outbreak.More than 900 U.S. Zika cases reported so far have all involved people who contracted the virus outside the United States in areas with active Zika outbreaks, or were infected through unprotected sex with an infected partner.There have not yet been any cases reported of local transmission of the virus in the United States, but health experts expect local transmission to occur with the onset of mosquito season, especially in Gulf Coast states such as Florida and Texas.The CDC plans to issue updated reports each Thursday to ensure that information about pregnancy outcomes linked with the Zika virus is publicly available.(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Bernadette Baum and Jonathan Oatis)"

Today, it's considered the most successful environmental treaty of all time. Why? Because it worked. Between 1980 and 2000, the use of harmful gases like chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, fell by about 97 percent.Now, according to a report published Thursday in the journal Science, the ozone layer is starting to heal, and the positive steps appear to be a direct result of our collective human action.The implications aren't lost on the report's lead author, Susan Solomon, a professor of atmospheric chemistry and climate science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.""We can now be confident that the things we’ve done have put the planet on a path to heal,"" Solomon told MIT News. “Which is pretty good for us, isn’t it? Aren’t we amazing humans, that we did something that created a situation that we decided collectively, as a world, ‘Let’s get rid of these molecules’? We got rid of them, and now we’re seeing the planet respond.”In the last several years, scientists have noted both an increasing trend in ozone layer health and a decrease in the amount of chemicals like CFCs that negatively affect the ozone layer. However, until now, they generally shied away from directly linking those improvements to human effort.Researchers at MIT, the National Center for Atmospheric Research and the University of Leeds in the U.K. found the ozone hole is about 1.5 million square miles smaller now than it was in the year 2000 -- an area MIT notes is equivalent in size to about half the contiguous United States.NASA expects the hole in the ozone layer to fully recover by the year 2070.But don't bust out the champagne just yet: As National Geographic notes, CFCs linger in the atmosphere for between 50 to 100 years. While we're on the right track, we aren't quite there.Still, that doesn't mean there isn't reason to be optimistic.“It’s been quite a remarkable history,” Solomon, whose research 30 years ago helped prompt the Montreal Protocol in the first place, told National Geographic. “It gives us hope that we shouldn’t be afraid to tackle large environmental problems."""

The video, filmed off the Turks and Caicos Islands, was published by YouTube user URZALA prod. The animal's sleep position may not look as comfortable as going supine on your pillow top queen, but for mammals that live in the water, sleeping up near the surface is about survival.""They need to be close enough to breathe easily during sleep,"" Paul Manger, a neuroethologist at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, told The Huffington Post.Whales, dolphins and other mammals that live in the water get the oxygen they need from the air. They ""breathe"" through the blowholes on the tops of their heads. So, the animals need to come to the water's surface both when they are awake and during sleep.Observing large groups of whales can be difficult, especially in the wild. But scientists who've observed some species say it's common for them to sleep in a suspended vertical position or a suspended horizontal position.But what really makes whales sleep pros is their ability to sleep with only half their brain at a time.""When whales and dolphins sleep, only half the brain is asleep at any one time with the other half being awake,"" Manger explained.Scientists suspect whales, dolphins and other water-dwelling mammals sleep like this for a lot of reasons, including to monitor breathing, to keep an eye out for potential predators and to conserve body heat and avoid hypothermia (since mammals lose body temperature during sleep).However, in one study, researchers captured footage of whales sleeping in the wild that showed they may sometimes sleep with both sides of their brain. The whales appeared to be totally asleep about 7 percent of the time -- less than two hours a day.""While there are good ideas about why whales and dolphins sleep the way they do, none of these are, as yet, fully proven,"" Manger said.Still, this video proves whales are pretty zen sleepers.Sarah DiGiulio is The Huffington Post’s sleep reporter.

After she secured enough delegates to clinch her party's nomination, Clinton gave a victory speech acknowledging the hard work of those who came before her.""Tonight's victory is not about one person. It belongs to generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and made this moment possible,"" she said. Her campaign also produced a video that gives a nod to other pioneering women, including the late Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress and the first black woman to run for a major party's presidential nomination.Though Clinton and Chisholm have their fair share of differences on policy issues, people who knew Chisholm and studied her legacy suggest that the two shared common ground where it mattered the most.“In 1972, Congresswoman Chisholm showed that a woman -- and not just any woman, but a woman of color -- could be a serious contender for the presidency. There’s no doubt in my mind that [she] would be inspired by Secretary Clinton’s continuation of that legacy,” said Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), one of Chisholm’s mentees.Back to the time of Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for president in 1872, female candidates have faced an extraordinary amount of sexism. When Woodhull and other suffrage activists testified before the House Judiciary Committee, for example, a news article felt it necessary to note their age and marital status, saying their group comprised ""old maids and maidens, candidates for matrimony and those who had lost all hope of sinking their names in those of the sterner sex.""Nearly 150 years later, some of that treatment continues. Clinton’s critics have scrutinized her appearance constantly during her 30-plus years in public service. During her first presidential bid in 2008, conservative pundit Michelle Malkin joked that the then-60 year-old ""looks 92,"" and columnist Pat Buchanan referred to her as a ""nagging wife."" This time around, Clinton continues to be told that she's not smiling enough or that her voice is too loud.In her book The Highest Glass Ceiling: Women’s Quest for the American Presidency, historian Ellen Fitzpatrick details the challenges Chisholm faced because of her race and gender. Her appearance served as fodder for disparaging comments throughout the campaign season -- particularly from then-President Richard Nixon's administration. At the height of the Democratic primary, a Nixon operative crafted fake press releases alleging that Chisholm was a ""transvestite in men’s clothing"" who remained under ""psychiatric care."" Nixon and his advisers also reportedly laughed at a photo of Chisholm and feminists Bella Abzug, Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem meeting, saying it looked like a ""burlesque.""Democrats weren't always all that much better. White politicians in the Democratic Party refused to take Chisholm's presidential campaign seriously, while black male politicians chose not to support her campaign out of concern that she would be the “candidate of the women” instead of the “candidate of the blacks.” A member of the Congressional Black Caucus even opted to publicly promote Cleveland Mayor Carl Stokes as a presidential candidate, even though he continuously rejected a presidential bid and Chisholm’s campaign was already underway.Though Chisholm had been an advocate for the right to abortion long before the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision, feminists also hesitated to support her bid for the White House. In a TV appearance with Chisholm, Steinem told the public that she would be supporting both Chisholm and her primary rival, Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.), since he was “the best white male candidate.” Clinton also lent her support to McGovern in the primary. It wasn’t until Chisholm rejected her “semi-endorsement” that Steinem endorsed her fully.But this disparaging treatment of Chisholm by the Democratic elite does not mean that she was ""anti-establishment,"" according to Fitzpatrick. ""She wanted in,"" Fitzpatrick told The Huffington Post in an interview. ""She was a Democratic Party loyalist who was trying to change the party to make it resemble the voters who were actually putting these people in office and expecting things from them. She wanted to bring women and African-Americans into the center of the party.""But even with the dual strides she made as an African-American female politician, Lee believes Chisholm’s contributions to public service shouldn’t be confined to her identity as a woman, or a black woman. In Lee’s view, she ran as a “progressive voice for the poor, the vulnerable, children, single moms, immigrants and everyone who has been locked out of the process.”Chisholm's pursuit of public service began by working with children as a teacher -- much like Clinton, who began working with the Children’s Defense Fund in 1973 after law school.The origins of Clinton’s public service career were rooted in more progressive politics, but by the 1990s, Clinton’s rhetoric had shifted to the center, in tandem with the policies of her husband's administration. Though she worked as an advocate for poor, marginalized and disabled children in the 1970s, Clinton adopted the racially coded ""super predator"" rhetoric that fueled the 1994 crime bill, claiming that young offenders were “kids with no conscience and no empathy” that needed to be ""brought to heel."" Clinton now says that she regrets that language and has moved to right those wrongs in her racial justice platform.Although both women were strong advocates for education, their legacies diverged when it came down to the type of education solutions they supported. “I think Ms. Chisholm would be most upset at the Democratic Party’s embrace of neoliberal solutions, like charter schools, privatized education and attacks on public schools and public school teachers,” said Barbara Winslow, founder and director of The Chisholm Project at the City University of New York’s Brooklyn campus. When asked if Clinton would be included in that critique, Winslow responded, “Oh yes.”In fact, one of Chisholm’s greatest achievements in the New York State Assembly was co-authoring and implementing legislation that established free city college tuition and other resources for students from underserved high schools -- a plan that Winslow believes is more aligned with that of Clinton's primary challenger, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.).Winslow also maintains that Clinton’s foreign policy stance further differentiates her from Chisholm. “She would be very disappointed in the hawkishness of the Democratic Party,” Winslow said.While Clinton voted for the Iraq War (and continues to defend it), Chisholm’s first speech as a U.S. congresswoman in 1969 was in opposition to the Vietnam War -- a position that did not win her many friends in Washington. Chisholm continued to oppose military spending bills, choosing instead to pressure her colleagues to vote in favor of more expansive welfare (but much of that progress was lost when both Clintons worked to pass the 1996 Welfare Reform Act).But even though the political differences between the two are stark, some believe that if she were here today, Chisholm would not hesitate to throw her support behind Clinton.Barbara Bullard, the producer of an upcoming biopic about Chisholm, firmly believes so. Though she would “embrace Bernie Sanders' economic initiatives,” Bullard believes Chisholm would “look at the bigger picture.”""I think Hillary is picking up a lot of similarities with Ms. Chisholm as well, like for instance, Ms. Chisholm fought for minimum wage for domestic workers, and now Hillary fighting for them as well. It's a part of her platform,"" Bullard said. “Ms. Chisholm fought for healthcare, and Hillary has been doing it since the 90s. Ms. Chisholm fought for the Equal Rights Amendment, and Hillary's also fighting for that.”“She would look at it strategically and say, ‘Hey, Hillary is going to move us forward,’” Bullard added.Joyce Cusack, a former Florida state representative, believes Chisholm’s lifelong commitment to getting more women elected to public office would be enough for her to support Clinton. Chisholm was Cusack's mentor and hosted a fundraiser for her during her first run for the state legislature. That was, after all, the the goal of the National Women’s Political Caucus, a grassroots organization Chisholm helped co-found in 1971 that focuses on recruiting and supporting women for elected office.“I firmly believe she’d get behind Secretary Clinton,” Cusack said. “I don’t think she would miss out on the opportunity to help open new doors in our country.” Fitzpatrick agrees, but she also says Chisholm’s dedication to gender parity in public office would not lead her to forsake her radical politics.“She was very radical in her beliefs. ... So while she would be delighted to see a woman emerge as the standard bearer of the Democratic Party,"" Fitzpatrick said, ""she would also feel that it was imperative that the candidate embody the goals and issues that were central to her.”"
19,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton’s Complex Embodiment Of Shirley Chisholm’s Legacy,Liz Adetiba,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-shirley-chisholm-legacy_us_57767fc2e4b09b4c43c006c9,"""Chisholm showed that a woman -- and not just any woman, but a woman of color -- could be a serious contender for the presidency.""",2016-07-01,"Victoria Woodhull ran for president as the Equal Rights Party's candidate in 1872. A century later, Shirley Chisholm would campaign for the Democratic nomination.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57769b821800002400fa3915.jpeg?ops=crop_12_509_2886_2333%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"As Democrats celebrate Hillary Clinton’s success as the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, many, including Clinton herself, are paying tribute to the women who helped pave the way for this historic moment. After she secured enough delegates to clinch her party's nomination, Clinton gave a victory speech acknowledging the hard work of those who came before her.""Tonight's victory is not about one person. It belongs to generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and made this moment possible,"" she said. Her campaign also produced a video that gives a nod to other pioneering women, including the late Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman elected to Congress and the first black woman to run for a major party's presidential nomination.Though Clinton and Chisholm have their fair share of differences on policy issues, people who knew Chisholm and studied her legacy suggest that the two shared common ground where it mattered the most.“In 1972, Congresswoman Chisholm showed that a woman -- and not just any woman, but a woman of color -- could be a serious contender for the presidency. There’s no doubt in my mind that [she] would be inspired by Secretary Clinton’s continuation of that legacy,” said Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.), one of Chisholm’s mentees.Back to the time of Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for president in 1872, female candidates have faced an extraordinary amount of sexism. When Woodhull and other suffrage activists testified before the House Judiciary Committee, for example, a news article felt it necessary to note their age and marital status, saying their group comprised ""old maids and maidens, candidates for matrimony and those who had lost all hope of sinking their names in those of the sterner sex.""Nearly 150 years later, some of that treatment continues. Clinton’s critics have scrutinized her appearance constantly during her 30-plus years in public service. During her first presidential bid in 2008, conservative pundit Michelle Malkin joked that the then-60 year-old ""looks 92,"" and columnist Pat Buchanan referred to her as a ""nagging wife."" This time around, Clinton continues to be told that she's not smiling enough or that her voice is too loud.In her book The Highest Glass Ceiling: Women’s Quest for the American Presidency, historian Ellen Fitzpatrick details the challenges Chisholm faced because of her race and gender. Her appearance served as fodder for disparaging comments throughout the campaign season -- particularly from then-President Richard Nixon's administration. At the height of the Democratic primary, a Nixon operative crafted fake press releases alleging that Chisholm was a ""transvestite in men’s clothing"" who remained under ""psychiatric care."" Nixon and his advisers also reportedly laughed at a photo of Chisholm and feminists Bella Abzug, Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem meeting, saying it looked like a ""burlesque.""Democrats weren't always all that much better. White politicians in the Democratic Party refused to take Chisholm's presidential campaign seriously, while black male politicians chose not to support her campaign out of concern that she would be the “candidate of the women” instead of the “candidate of the blacks.” A member of the Congressional Black Caucus even opted to publicly promote Cleveland Mayor Carl Stokes as a presidential candidate, even though he continuously rejected a presidential bid and Chisholm’s campaign was already underway.Though Chisholm had been an advocate for the right to abortion long before the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision, feminists also hesitated to support her bid for the White House. In a TV appearance with Chisholm, Steinem told the public that she would be supporting both Chisholm and her primary rival, Sen. George McGovern (D-S.D.), since he was “the best white male candidate.” Clinton also lent her support to McGovern in the primary. It wasn’t until Chisholm rejected her “semi-endorsement” that Steinem endorsed her fully.But this disparaging treatment of Chisholm by the Democratic elite does not mean that she was ""anti-establishment,"" according to Fitzpatrick. ""She wanted in,"" Fitzpatrick told The Huffington Post in an interview. ""She was a Democratic Party loyalist who was trying to change the party to make it resemble the voters who were actually putting these people in office and expecting things from them. She wanted to bring women and African-Americans into the center of the party.""But even with the dual strides she made as an African-American female politician, Lee believes Chisholm’s contributions to public service shouldn’t be confined to her identity as a woman, or a black woman.

20,TECH,Facebook Bolts From Traditional News,Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/facebook-news_us_577674a4e4b0a629c1a98d12,It's back to basics for the social media giant.,2016-07-01,A promotional image from Facebook's Paper website as it appeared Thursday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57768dbf1800002400fa38d4.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Facebook wants out of the news business.The company announced Thursday that it is shuttering Paper, a relatively obscure iOS app that displayed Facebook's News Feed differently, emphasizing media and news articles. The app contained topic pages like ""Tech,"" for instance, and tapping on those sections would display a series of related stories for you to interact with.By Friday, Paper had already been removed from the App Store, and its official website was scrubbed from the internet.The decision to dump Paper comes immediately after a highly publicized announcement from Facebook this week that it will prioritize posts from your friends above those from ""Pages"" -- a catch-all term for media outlets and brands that use the social network to connect to their audiences.If you wonder whether the two might be connected, consider Wired's original review of the Paper app in 2014.""The most radical aspect of Paper, though, is that it isn’t predicated entirely on your friends,"" Kyle Vanhemert wrote.""By expanding the scope and quality of content you can expect to find there, Paper is trying to position itself as a place you’ll go for news and inspiration–and, just as importantly, as the kind of place you’ll want to contribute to yourself,"" he added.News at the expense of friends is the last thing Facebook wants now, as we learned from the algorithm shift earlier this week. Yes, the company has closed down plenty of services before -- in Vanity Fair this month, a former employee describes a ""crowded graveyard of forgotten Facebook product failures."" But Paper's demise is just the latest item in a trend.The app's death follows a dust up over Facebook's supposed bias against conservative news in its ""Trending Topics"" module. After that, Facebook met with members of the conservative media and politicians to assuage their ire and overhauled the company's guidelines on how trending news items are selected.And even before, the social network altered its News Feed algorithm to prioritize live video content from people and brands, which sent media outlets -- many of which profit from the firehose of traffic Facebook can provide -- into a panic. News that Facebook is paying companies, including The Huffington Post, to create live programs did little to quell fears over the future of the written word -- nor did a blunt statement from Facebook executive Nicola Mendelsohn about the social network being ""all video"" within five years.More than a year before Mendelsohn's declaration, the social network enacted an algorithm shift that highlighted personal content, though the language in that update emphasized ""balance"" between those posts and others. Not so anymore.The message couldn't be more clear: Facebook is in retreat from the notion that it's a news service, and it wants to cement its reputation as a place where people connect with other people, not brands.Perhaps that's because Facebook is losing ground. Not so long ago, if you wanted to post a personal story or photo online, Facebook was the place to do it. Then your mom joined. And your boyfriend's weird aunt. You got a friend request from your high school principal.It's nice to be connected to everyone, but sometimes you just want to post your keg stand in peace. Enter Snapchat, which has swiftly climbed in popularity over the last two years, especially with people between the ages of 18 and 34. The platform offers total control over who you share content with, and that content automatically deletes itself after viewing. It's a stark contrast to Facebook's confusing privacy controls and overall permanence.While Snapchat rose, Facebook is said to have suffered a significant decline in ""personal sharing"" on its network -- meaning people like you and me are posting less about our lives. A report on Thursday indicated that much the same thing has happened on Facebook-owned Instagram.The bottom line: Facebook is doing what it can to stay relevant and exert more control over its more than 1 billion users. Today, that means pivoting away from the fickle news media and doing more to encourage people to talk to one another without branded noise gumming up their feeds.More personal sharing means more ways to target ads, and it might also mean more incentive for people to get hooked on the platform -- for many, the app is at its best when it's social in more than name only. Will the changes ultimately resonate with the millions of people who use Facebook for news? We'll just have to wait and see. "
21,POLITICS,Lawmakers Sue Their Colleagues For Blocking A Local Minimum Wage Hike,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alabama-lawsuit-minimum-wage_us_57757985e4b09b4c43bf9401,African-American legislators in Alabama argue that the state violated civil rights laws when it blocked Birmingham from raising its wage floor to $10.10.,2016-06-30,"A lawsuit over a law to block a minimum wage raise in Birmingham was originally filed by fast-food workers, but it was amended Thursday to include the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus and nine black lawmakers as plaintiffs.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of African-American state lawmakers in Alabama sued their colleagues in federal court on Thursday, claiming they violated civil rights law by blocking a minimum wage increase in Birmingham.The Birmingham City Council passed a measure earlier this year that would have raised the city's wage floor from $7.25 to $10.10. In a move that's become common in Republican-controlled states, Alabama's state legislators rushed to pass a so-called pre-emption law barring cities from hiking the minimum wage. The state law effectively scuttled Birmingham's local law.It was difficult to miss the racial undercurrents of the dispute: Alabama's statehouse is mostly white. Birmingham itself is overwhelmingly black. Thirty percent of its residents live below the federal poverty line, according to census data.The African-American lawmakers and the state chapter of the NAACP argue that the state is guilty of worse than paternalism. They say the pre-emption measure violates the Voting Rights Act, the landmark civil rights law, by disenfranchising a local, majority-black electorate.""It perpetuates an official policy of political white supremacy that has been maintained in Alabama since it became a state in 1819, whereby white control is preserved by state government over the governing bodies of majority-black counties, cities, and educational institutions,"" the strongly worded complaint states.Rep. John Rogers (D) is a plaintiff in the suit. In a statement issued Thursday, Rogers said he found no pleasure in suing his fellow lawmakers in the statehouse. ""But when colleagues take racist actions that strip black Alabama residents of their political power, we cannot remain silent,"" Rogers said.Birmingham fast-food workers originally filed a lawsuit over the pre-emption law back in April. But the complaint they filed was amended Thursday to include the Alabama Legislative Black Caucus and nine black lawmakers as plaintiffs.The showdown in Birmingham has garnered national attention at a time when cities across the country are raising their own wage floors. In February, when it became clear lawmakers in Montgomery would short-circuit Birmingham's decision-making, the city's mayor, William Bell, and city lawmakers hustled to speed up the implementation of the minimum wage raise. But the state Senate and House quickly passed the pre-emption law, generally along party lines. Gov. Robert Bentley, a Republican, signed the bill less than an hour after the final vote, according to the Montgomery Advertiser.Rep. David Faulkner (R) was the sponsor of the original measure. The town he represents, Mountain Brook, is 97 percent white and among the wealthiest communities in the country. Birmingham, by contrast, is nearly three-quarters African-American. Pre-emption laws have been popping up in states around the country where Republicans hold control. The laws basically prevent cities and counties from implementing their own labor laws, like a minimum wage hike or a paid leave requirement. Backers of the pre-emption bills say they don't want a confusing patchwork of different laws throughout their state.But opponents of such bills, including the Obama administration, say Republicans are merely trying to keep wages down for the benefit of businesses. They argue that pre-emption laws violate the premise of self-governance, a basic tenet of conservatism, by taking authority away from cities and counties. As Labor Secretary Tom Perez put it in a blog post on The Huffington Post, ""A belief in local decision-making autonomy is an article of faith for many conservatives — except, apparently, when it’s not."""

Mike Lee (R-Utah) thinks his bud Ted Cruz would be a good VP choice.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577532f91500002a006c90a0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), one of Donald Trump's more outspoken skeptics, urged the presumptive nominee to appoint one of three Republican senators as his running mate in order to calm conservative concern over his candidacy. In an interview with The Huffington Post, Lee said that Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) should be on Trump's short list, calling the two good choices. Asked about another colleague, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), Lee initially balked but then said that he too would help flesh out Trump's ticket. ""I think Trump needs to gain the trust of the conservative base within the Republican Party and he needs a VP who would help him do that,"" said Lee. ""Cruz, Paul and Rubio all have substantial followings. They were all presidential candidates and they are all respected among members of the conservative grass-roots activist base and I think Trump really needs that.""If anyone is aware of the type of conservative skeptic that Trump needs to reach, it's Lee himself. The Utah Republican has refused to endorse Trump, and on Wednesday, he erupted on a conservative radio talk show host for asking why he was refusing to support the candidate. ""I mean, we can get into the fact that he accused my best friend's father of conspiring to kill JFK,"" Lee responded, referencing the time that Trump discussed a National Enquirer item saying that Cruz's dad was pictured in New Orleans with Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963.Lee told HuffPost that it wasn't just Trump's bombast that compelled him to withhold his support, but Trump's penchant for authoritarian-like policy too. In particular, Trump's declaration that he would unilaterally ban Muslims from immigrating to the United States struck Lee as likely unconstitutional -- ""I'm not aware of any authority the president would have to simply say, that's it, I'm single-handedly banning all types of immigration of this sort or that sort"" -- and dangerously similar to the type of persecution that his Mormon ancestors faced. ""There are lots of reasons why, as a religious minority myself, as a religious minority who belongs to a church whose people were ordered exterminated by the governor of Missouri in 1838, I find that kind of statement disquieting to say the least,"" Lee said. ""It does a lot to explain his poll numbers in Utah. So yeah, that worries me."" By choosing someone like Cruz, Rubio or Paul as his running mate, Trump would soothe those worries. But that's all premised on those senators agreeing to serve on the same ticket. Rubio has ruled it out, choosing to run for re-election instead. Cruz has not endorsed Trump. And while Paul apparently hasn't discussed it much (if at all), there have been few if any reports that Trump has taken him into consideration. Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S. CORRECTION: This article previously misstated that the National Enquirer claimed Ted Cruz's father knew Lee Harvey Oswald in Cuba; its story claimed that the senior Cruz had been photographed with Oswald in New Orleans in 1963."

Chris Christie (R), once a rival to presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, has emerged as a contender to become Trump's vice presidential running mate.Christie, who endorsed Trump soon after he ended his own bid for the GOP nomination, is being vetted by those leading the real estate mogul's VP search, The New York Times first reported. A source confirmed the news to CNN.As Trump has caused controversy after controversy, Christie has become one of his strongest defenders. When the real estate mogul launched a series of racist attacks against a federal judge, Christie immediately intervened by arguing that Trump was not racist.Within Trump's campaign, Christie has taken on an influential role, leading the transition team that is planning a potential Trump administration. He is reportedly helping Trump secure donations from prominent GOP donors, who so far have been reluctant to back Trump, and has reached out to his fellow GOP governors to encourage them to support the real estate mogul.The New Jersey governor's quick endorsement of Trump in February surprised many political observers, including politicians in his home state. Once seen as an establishment Republican and rising star within the party, Christie attaching himself to Trump's candidacy and brand seemed to be a shameless political move. In particular, Christie spent much of his presidential campaign criticizing Trump, once calling him ""a carnival barker"" and ""entertainer in chief.""Christie's now steadfast support of Trump has also been the subject of mockery. During one of his first appearances with Trump, people on social media commented that Christie looked like a hostage.“I don’t know what I was supposed to be doing,” Christie said in response. “I was standing there listening to him. All these armchair psychiatrists should give it a break. ... He was answering questions from the national press corps, and I was listening. This is part of the hysteria of the people who oppose my Trump endorsement. They want to read anything into it that can be negative.”“So no, I wasn’t being held hostage,” he added. “No, I wasn’t sitting up there thinking, ‘Oh my God, what have I done?’”More recently, Christie had to deny that he is Trump's ""manservant,"" following reports earlier this month that he was seen picking up Trump's McDonald's order.Trump is expected to announce his vice presidential pick at the GOP convention in Cleveland next month.UPDATE: 7:24 p.m. -- Trump aides told The Washington Post later Thursday that the announcement could come as soon as next week, in order to unify the party ahead of the convention.In addition to Christie, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) also is a strong contender to be Trump's running mate. Gingrich, like Christie, has defended Trump, arguing on Sunday that Trump's tendency to eschew facts and take inconsistent policy positions are signs that he is ""evolving"" as a candidate."
24,POLITICS,"If You Tell Your Senator To Do Their Job, They Might Block You On Twitter",Jacquie Lee,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-cornyn-twitter-blocked_us_57755468e4b0bd4b0b13e514,A constituent of John Cornyn brought up Merrick Garland's nomination. It didn't go well.,2016-06-30,Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) has apparently blocked a constituent on Twitter. It might have something to do with the #DoYourJob hashtag that's been circling the internet.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577554d3150000ed026c914c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you’re upset with a store or restaurant, mad your flight is delayed or frustrated your elected officials won’t #DoTheirJob, there’s a quick fix, thanks to Twitter. At least that’s what Jason Steed thought. Steed, an appellate lawyer based in Dallas, tweeted at Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) on Tuesday to “do his job” and vote on Judge Merrick Garland's nomination to the Supreme Court, a confirmation that has been pending since President Barack Obama nominated Garland in March. Tuesday’s tweet is one of many that Steed has sent to Cornyn’s account, the lawyer told The Huffington Post. In fact, the senator had responded amicably to a few of Steed’s comments in the past, Steed said. But Cornyn, apparently, has had enough. When Steed clicked on a link to the senator’s Twitter account Thursday morning, he couldn’t see it. Steed was blocked, he said.“I don’t know if there was any single event that happened,” he said. “I guess somewhere along the way he got tired of it.”Cornyn’s office did not respond to requests for comment.Garland has waited over 100 days since he was nominated, but Cornyn and many Republican senators have refused to hold a vote to confirm him. “The only way to empower the American people and ensure they have a voice is for the next president to make the nomination to fill this vacancy,” Cornyn said in March.Steed clearly didn’t agree. He tweeted at the senator using the viral hashtag #DoYourJob. Texas also has the highest number of vacant judge seats -- positions that must also be confirmed by the Senate. Those issues pushed Steed to start tweeting at Cornyn, he said.Now that Steed is apparently blocked, he’s considering filing a lawsuit against the senator for “denying my right to petition govt & unequal treatment.”The tweets were all tongue in cheek, Steed said. But he does have a problem with an elected official shutting a constituent out. “So everyone else (who he hasn’t blocked) can see what their senator is saying about important issues, but I can’t. That’s a problem,” Steed said in an email. “I mean if it’s his personal account, feel free to block whoever you want, but if it’s a verified account that’s being held out as the senator’s account... then I think that’s different.” Although Steed was joking when he suggesting filing a lawsuit, he said someone might have a claim if they were mad enough, he said.“I don’t know enough [to be sure] but I think there’s enough there that makes it seem somewhat viable to me,” he said. “Particularly because you’re dealing with an official account.” This isn’t the first time a lawmaker has allegedly blocked a constituent. In 2011, Rick Perry apparently blocked a constituent for her Twitter comments.And this issue, it turns out, is nonpartisan. A Democratic council member in Seattle apparently blocked a couple people just last week, and Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed (D) supposedly has a history of blocking both constituents and journalists on Twitter.“Whether there’s anything legally or constitutionally wrong with it, you’re supposed to represent everyone in the state, or everybody in your district if you’re a congressperson,” Steed said. “Any elected representative should have the door open to hear what anybody in their district or their state is saying.”"

Local authorities even prosecuted her for perjury for registering to vote, a charge for which she was later acquitted at trial.The state Supreme Court ultimately held that her conviction for the drug crime disqualified Griffin from voting under the state constitution, and left it up to the people of Iowa to amend the constitution -- or maybe pass a new law -- to eliminate this impediment.""A new definition will be up to the future evolution of our understanding of voter disqualification as a society, revealed through the voices of our democracy,"" the court said. Under Iowa's constitution, only the governor can restore a person's right to vote, at his sole discretion.All three dissenting justices on Thursday issued separate opinions, each setting out different rationales for why they believed the majority got it wrong. But Justice Daryl Hecht in particular issued a booming dissent, pushing back on the idea that allowing Griffin and other convicted felons to vote would somehow be an affront to other voters.""The notion that allowing Griffin to vote will render the ballot box impure, disrupt the electoral process, or damage institutions of democratic governance is fanciful at best,"" he wrote.Relying on social research and other studies, Hecht added that society suffers as a whole whenever public institutions exclude people from the democratic process, as when a series of executive measures in Iowa deprived of the vote roughly 14,500 people who had already paid their societal debts.""Because many of these disenfranchised felons -- like Griffin -- were convicted of crimes having no relationship to the integrity of the electoral process or other democratic institutions, I believe a negative societal impact has occurred,"" Hecht wrote.Another judge, Justice Brent Appel, called the majority's reading of ""infamous crimes"" in the state constitution ""anachronistic.""In a statement, the American Civil Liberties Union lamented the Iowa Supreme Court's decision.""This ruling means that Iowa will continue to serve as a notorious outlier when it comes to restricting people’s right to vote,” said Julie Ebenstein, an attorney with the ACLU’s Voting Rights Project.Iowa, Kentucky and Florida are the only three states that impose a permanent voting ban on former felony offenders, according to the ACLU.For his part, Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate praised Thursday's outcome, which he said adheres to precedent and historic definitions.""My office will continue to work to preserve the integrity and fairness of Iowa elections and strive to help and encourage every eligible Iowan to participate in the electoral process,"" Pate said in a statement."

She spared her husband's life, however, for a reason, Fort Bend County’s sheriff said.“She wanted him to suffer,” Sheriff Troy Nehls said of Christy’s husband, Jason Sheats, 45, at a press conference Wednesday. ""Christy had ample time and opportunity to shoot and kill Mr. Sheats in the home but she chose not to.""""Mr. Sheats stated Christy knew how much he loved Taylor and Madison and how much they loved him,"" Nehls said. ""Mr. Sheats will have to live the rest of his life with this horrible memory.""Christy Sheats was killed at the scene by police who'd responded to multiple 911 calls.Law enforcement officials who spoke with Jason Sheats said that Christy had been taking several medications for depression and anxiety. She'd also been treated at three different private mental health facilities since 2012, the sheriff's office said in a statement.On the day of the bloodshed, Christy had wanted to ground Taylor and prevent her from seeing her fiancé, whom she'd planned to marry on June 27, because of an argument she and Taylor had, KHOU reported.Jason told police that he disagreed with his wife’s decision, calling it ""inappropriate,"" and said that when Christy called the family meeting, he thought she was going to tell their daughters about their plans to formally separate.Christy instead pulled out the .38-caliber handgun and shot each of her daughters once. She then chased her family out into the street, where she shot Taylor twice more. At one point during the attack, a neighbor reported seeing her briefly go back inside the house to reload her weapon.Nehls said that Christy had inherited the gun from her grandfather. She had applied for a license to carry a handgun, but the state refused her application. Authorities are now trying to determine why her request was denied.There had been multiple service calls from the family’s home since 2012, according to Nehls. Three of them involved suicide attempts by Christy Sheats, five were false alarms, one was a medical call, one involved a verbal altercation and one was a call from Christy asking to speak with a deputy for an undisclosed reason.A funeral service for the two sisters will be held on Tuesday, while their mother will have her own service out of state, the Houston Chronicle reported."
29,MEDIA,New York Times Reporter Lands Book Deal To Report On The New York Times,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/adam-nagourney-new-york-times-book_us_57752a14e4b0bd4b0b13afed,"""I'm not going to pull any punches,” says Los Angeles bureau chief Adam Nagourney.",2016-06-30,New York Times reporter Adam Nagourney will turn his focus inward for a forthcoming book about the Times.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57756dc9150000ed026c91a3.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- New York Times veteran Adam Nagourney has lived through some of the newspaper's biggest scandals, from plagiarism to overly credulous national security reporting. He's also been there for the abrupt firing of top editors and experienced nearly two decades of management grappling with an industry in free fall.Now he’ll get to relive it all as the Times' latest biographer.Nagourney, who joined the Times in 1996, is writing a contemporary history of the newspaper, spanning four decades, for the Crown publishing imprint Tim Duggan Books, a deal first reported by Politico.“With everything going on in the media industry, this feels like a really important, timely book and it’s a subject that I’m really passionate about,” Nagourney said in an interview with The Huffington Post.Nagourney, a longtime political reporter and currently the paper's Los Angeles bureau chief, said he is taking inspiration from former Timesman and New Journalism pioneer Gay Talese, who chronicled the paper in his magisterial 1969 book The Kingdom and the Power. Nagourney plans to pick up around where Talese left off, beginning his book with Abe Rosenthal’s rise in the 1970s to become executive editor. One key difference, however, is that when The Kingdom was published, Talese had already left the Times and was writing now-classic magazine stories for Esquire, which ran excerpts from Talese's book about the newspaper.Nagourney plans to do archival research and conduct interviews, largely with past editors and reporters, while continuing to work for the Times over the next two years. He intends to take a year-long leave from the Times in the summer of 2018 to finish reporting and to write the book. It's slated to be published in 2020, when Nagourney will presumably be writing about the next presidential campaign for the Times. Though Nagourney is quick to profess his love for the institution, he’ll be obligated to cover some episodes in the newsroom that his current and former colleagues might just as soon forget. The book, he said, will have to be “completely honest and completely balanced.”“I’m not going to pull any punches, and I don’t think the Times deserves a book that pulls any punches,” Nagourney said. “I think it’s a very balanced, nuanced story. The Times is a very fascinating, powerful, wonderful place run by incredibly talented and often flawed people, who can do some great stuff and can also screw some stuff up. And we’re trying to take the paper through a very, very difficult time and trying things and making mistakes and doing things right... I just think the Times deserves no less than a very, very honest book.”While there exists no one comprehensive account of the Times in the years since the 1970s, episodes such as the 2003 Jayson Blair plagiarism scandal were covered at the time by outlets like the New York Observer, investigated by the Times itself and chronicled in journalist Seth Mnookin’s book Hard News. Journalists have also written extensively about the paper’s flawed pre-Iraq War coverage, especially the work of former Times reporter Judith Miller.Nagourney acknowledged the difficulty in covering such deeply mined topics, but likened the challenge to those faced by authors like Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, political journalists who have continued to find new details for election books even months and years after those elections happened. “When you go back and return to a subject a few years later, you find out things that just weren’t available then, because archives are available and people are more willing to talk and you have the kind of historical perspective,” Nagourney said. “Obviously, what happened with Jayson Blair and Judy Miller is going to be a significant part of this book, and hopefully I will be able to add to some very fine reporting that’s already been done on those subjects.”Nagourney, who co-wrote a 2001 book on the gay rights movement, said he has been thinking for several years about writing his second book on the Times. But it wasn’t until around six months ago that he began pulling together a proposal and discussed his plans with Times publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr., who has agreed to cooperate with the book.Sulzberger has already announced a succession plan to steer the Times, and the newsroom is going through a major reorganization known as Project 2020 — all of which will make the institution something of a moving target over the next few years. To minimize this problem, Nagourney plans to wrap up his four-decade saga with the 2014 firing of executive editor Jill Abramson, who is currently writing her own book on media industry disruption. He plans to cover post-2014 developments in the book's epilogue. That way, he said, he won't have to juggle reporting real-time issues and controversies at the Times for his book and simultaneously reporting the news for the Times itself.“That’s one reason I make it the history, versus ‘what’s going on right now at The New York Times,’” he said. “Because that would be awkward.”"

Kelly Ayotte (R) from attending a fundraiser scheduled for Thursday with a lobbyist for one of those schools.There are others involved in the event, but the lobbyist in question is Jeff Pannozzo, the vice president of BridgePAC, the political action committee that promotes Bridgepoint Education. That company is currently under investigation by several state attorneys general, the Securities Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It was also the subject of a Huffington Post probe in 2011 and a scathing Senate hearing that year, which was Ayotte's first in office. Among the allegations levied against the outfit are claims that it lures students with false promises, offers a poor education, and has an enormous dropout rate. Its students are then left with mountains of debt and no degrees.And while Ayotte, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has taken a personal interest in education benefits for veterans, working to preserve GI Bill payouts as recently as April, veterans have been named as a particular target of Bridgepoint, whose Ashford University branch was allegedly motivated by the lure of the federal cash available from the GI Bill.Ayotte's campaign did not answer an email request for comment.The senator's affiliation with Bridgepoint is not isolated.According to data kept by the Federal Election Commission and crunched by the Center for Responsive Politics, the PAC has given Ayotte $8,000 for this election. Another PAC that promotes similar for-profit universities, the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, chipped in another $1,000 to the senator. The Bridgepoint donations started in February last year, and Ayotte noticed.""Thank you for your kind and generous contribution. I deeply appreciate your support and friendship,"" she wrote them in a thank-you note posted on the group's website. ""It is a great honor to serve in the United States Senate. No matter how difficult the political climate may be, I remain steadfast in my commitment to stand up for the beliefs that you and I share.""The first-term senator is locked in an extremely tight contest with Gov. Maggie Hassan (D), and her contest is seen as one of the keys for Democrats if they are to retake control of the Senate.UPDATE: June 30 -- Bridgepoint's PAC has since removed the page where it posted Ayotte's thank-you note. The PAC's manager did not answer an email asking why the page was gone, but a cached version can be found here."

Some busybodies told her she should focus on “cute” subjects, and even said she should stick to “tea parties and dolls.”But while tea parties and dolls are fine, they certainly aren't what got Hilde a book deal.Scholastic announced Thursday that they acquired the rights to a four-book mystery series that will be co-written by Hilde and her father, Matthew Lysiak. He’s a former New York Daily News reporter who previously told The Huffington Post that his daughter caught the reporting bug when she was accompanying him on assignments.The books, targeted towards children ages 6-8, will feature Hilde and her older sister, Izzy, as the main characters, reporting around town. The first book, slated to be published in the fall of 2017, will be titled Hilde Cracks The Case, according to the Scholastic press release.“I want kids who read these books to love reporting like I do,” Hilde said in the release. An email to Hilde was forwarded to a Scholastic rep, who said Hilde was at camp and not available for comment. Hilde became a viral sensation in April after she not only broke the story of a murder, but also addressed her critics in a defiant video.“I know some of you just want me to sit down and be quiet because I’m 9,” she said in the video. ““But if you want me to stop covering news, then you get off your computer and do something about the news. There, is that cute enough for you?”"

Not a single state has achieved gender parity among judges, the ACS found, while only seven have courts that are racially and ethnically representative of their population. And this is still true even though women and minorities have been entering the legal field at record numbers.The report, aptly titled ""The Gavel Gap,"" rates all 50 states and the District of Columbia as follows: A for those that have achieved at least 90 percent parity, B for 80-89 percent parity, C for 70-79 percent parity, D for 60-69 percent parity and F for those below 60 percent.More than half of the states earned an F for their lack of progress in putting women on the bench. The four that at least rated a B are Oregon, Nevada, the District of Columbia and New Mexico.About two-thirds of the states are failing when it comes to racial and ethnic parity on the bench. But Hawaii, the District of Columbia, Oregon, New Mexico, Minnesota, Arizona and Maryland got an A grade.State courts are the workhorses of the American judicial system. They rule on everything from traffic cases to civil suits to all kinds of criminal prosecutions. While the U.S. Supreme Court hears around 70 cases per year, state judges presided over 94 million cases in 2013, according to the report.There are real-life consequences to the lack of diversity there.Studies have shown that judges, like millions of their fellow Americans, hold implicit racial biases that can affect their decision making. White judges, for example, are more likely than black judges to dismiss claims of race-based discrimination. In criminal trials, where 68 percent of the defendants are black or Latino, African-Americans who are found guilty are more likely to go to prison than their white counterparts, according to a study by the Rand Corporation.Last month, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned a Georgia state court ruling that would have allowed prosecutors seeking the death penalty against a black defendant to get away with eliminating all potential black jurors. Chief Justice John Roberts called the state's arguments “nonsense.” The ACS ranked Georgia 34th out of 51 in overall judicial representativeness. The consequences of an unrepresentative judiciary affect women as well. Studies have shown that women are twice as likely to win sexual harassment and discrimination cases when the presiding judge is female.The Obama administration has emphasized the need for representative courts and touted the fact that the federal judiciary is more diverse than ever. But clearly more work needs to be done at the state level.While the ACS report did not include specific recommendations for action, other legal organizations, like the New York University School of Law's Brennan Center for Justice, have offered best practices for states seeking both to mitigate the effects of a non-representative bench and to build a more diverse judiciary. These include teaching judges how to recognize and overcome their own implicit biases, increasing recruitment of female and minority judicial candidates, and appointing diversity compliance officers to keep up the push.As Chris Kang, a former deputy assistant to Obama tasked with overseeing the judicial nomination process, said in a recent op-ed, “when the men and women who deliver justice look more like the communities they serve, there is greater confidence in our justice system overall.” "
