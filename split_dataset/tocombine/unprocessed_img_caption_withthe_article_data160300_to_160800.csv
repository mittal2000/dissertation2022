Not since Barney and Mr. Roger's Neighborhood have I been so profoundly affected by children's entertainment. I'm not normally the type of person who writes to celebrities, so I hope you appreciate how intense my feelings are. I will never be the same again. I hate you. I know I shouldn't lash out at people whose jobs are designed only to bring joy and the occasional positive message to little children, but really, I hate you. First, what is up with the ridiculous names and hideous costumes? How do the five of you jump around on stage in those rubberized suits without passing out? Y'all looked like Weebles (for those of you too young to know what I'm talking about, Weebles were only the BEST toy ever) but not in a good way. DJ Lance is the only one who escaped the indignity of looking like he had been shoved in a revamped Teletubbies outfit, but that orange jumpsuit makes him look like an escapee from a music video from the 1970's. Then there was the music. I felt like my ears were bleeding. I don't know what was worse, the songs themselves or the maniacal mother behind me screeching the lyrics while her daughter put her hands over her ears and kicked the back of my chair. I couldn't tell if the girl was trying to block out the music or her mother, but in addition to the overpriced merchandise in the lobby, I could have used some earplugs. This is just a thought, but your audience is a bunch of preschoolers with delicate ears, so how about making sure they can still hear their parents yelling at them after the show? These are kids who can hear the sound of the cookie jar opening from three rooms away -- I guarantee they'll be able to follow ""There's a Party in My Tummy"" if you turn the volume down just a smidge. Speaking of ""There's a Party in My Tummy,"" is there any way to mix up the lyrics a bit? I know these are little kids who value repetition, but I'm pretty sure they can handle something more complex than the two line ""There's a party in my tummy, so yummy, so yummy."" I'd be happy to point you to some examples of music both kids and their parents can enjoy. How about Bare Naked Ladies' ""Snacktime,"" The Laurie Berkner Band, Dan Zane, or Jack Johnson's ""Curious George"" soundtrack? You made a good choice though with Biz Markie. I never thought I'd be exposing my son to beatboxing at such an early age, but those ten minutes saved me from throwing myself over the balcony. Most horrifying was how the adults behaved. I've been to college grunge concerts, frat parties and even a bridal sale at Filene's Basement and I've never seen people behave so badly. I was prepared for tantrums, meltdowns and the occasional stink-eye, but I expected them from the kids, not their caretakers. The adults in attendance shoved my kids out line, pushed past them on the stairs, and snapped at them while trying to get to their seats. They let their own children scream, cry, kick chairs and run around like maniacs. There was one dad whose son wailed through the entire show, calming down only during intermission when the music stopped. I know exactly how that kid felt. I wanted to tap his dad on the shoulder and say, ""Hey, I know it's a drag, but this one just isn't going to work. Give your kid a break, suck up the $70 you spent on tickets and go get some ice cream."" To be fair, bad parental behavior isn't really your fault, but still. For a group that claims, in part, to promote prosocial behavior in kids, the audience was surprisingly hostile to the lessons from the stage. And I understand that tours are how you make money and don't begrudge you some stuffed toys and t-shirts in the lobby. Both the boys got miniature Plex dolls to take home with them. Miniature, because I couldn't bear to pay for the larger versions. After spending over $100 on tickets, I had to limit the swag, not that you made that easy with your brightly colored goods strategically placed in every nook of the theater. You mixed things up too -- toys, shirts, glow sticks. Glow sticks? Are we at a Dead concert? I'd like to give a special shout out to the woman walking through the aisles to hawk merchandise in case we missed it in the lobby, on the landing and right outside the theater doors. She miraculously arrived with a pile of glow sticks right when you were singing the song about being afraid of the dark. What are the chances? I give you credit. You go out on stage with energy and enthusiasm and the kids loved it. My IQ may have dropped 15 points, but no one can say you don't deliver a show where kids can shake their sillies out. That being said, I've learned my lesson. Until my kids are old enough to appreciate Matchbox 20, we'll skip the concerts. Sincerely,  Devon ""the cranky mom in Seat L20"""

The study, conducted by Bruce Temkin of the Temkin Group, found that among 10,000 American travelers, Alaska Airlines and Southwest Airlines were considered the best domestic carriers for customer service. According to the Dallas Morning News, customers were asked questions based on three criteria: functionality, accessibility and emotion. Though Southwest was top ranked in the first two categories -- meaning the airline was flexible and helpful to its customers -- Alaska dominated the emotion category, which charts how people felt about their experience on board overall. Still, the study didn't exactly represent a red letter day for either airline as both were awarded only 68% of the points passengers could give to each airline.It is worth noting that Virgin America, which generally receives accolades for its inventive service, was not included in the study.Another finding of the survey was that US Airways and American Airlines were the least popular carriers. Their bottom of the barrel ratings led Temkin to observe in a press release that their looming merger ""has the potential to become a mega-monster if the new firm doesn’t aggressively improve its customer experience.” The annual SKYTRAX World Airline Awards, which celebrate industry excellence, are perennially dominated by Asian and Middle Eastern airlines. American airlines, more entrenched and far more casual in their approach to service, generally don't benefit by contrast to, say, Malaysian Airlines, which offers excellent food and solicitous service.If the new survey shows anything, it is that domestic carriers shouldn't so much be working on making customers' experiences great as they should be focused on making them less miserable."

And the proportion of parents of those girls who said they didn't plan to get their daughters the rest - or any - of their HPV shots rose from 40 percent to 44 percent, the research team wrote Monday in Pediatrics.At the same time, the proportion who cited safety concerns as their reason for abstaining from getting the HPV vaccine increased from less than five percent to 16 percent.For all three vaccines asked about in the survey, other reasons parents gave for skipping their teenagers' shots included not thinking they were necessary, not having had a specific vaccine recommended by a doctor and, for the HPV vaccine, believing their child was not sexually active.""These are wonderful vaccines preventing severe diseases,"" Darden told Reuters Health in an email. ""HPV is the first vaccine that will prevent cancer which is a tremendous health benefit.""Dempsey said past research has suggested that although more girls are being vaccinated against HPV, vaccine rates haven't increased as quickly as for other shots, such as Tdap.Darden reports having been a consultant for Pfizer, and one of his co-authors is on a safety monitoring board for vaccine studies funded by Merck, which makes Gardasil, one of the HPV vaccines.Parents shouldn't rely on the media or Internet to learn about vaccines, according to Dempsey, since it's hard to tell what information is legitimate.""If they have questions or concerns, they should trust their provider to give them accurate information about the vaccine,"" she said.SOURCE: bit.ly/cxXOG Pediatrics, online March 18, 2013.Copyright 2012 Thomson Reuters.

Vogue UK reports that the royal, wife to Prince Edward, has signed a three-year patronage with the college. It's quite common for royals like Sophie to support a charity through patronage (Kate announced her support for several arts and addiction charities last year), but rarely has a fashion-related organization received official support from a royal in such a major way.Sophie isn't nearly as famous as her queenly mother-in-law, but she has been recognized for her chic style. Like her fellow royal family members, she's also weathered a few scandals, including the leaking of a topless photograph during her engagement to Prince Edward and a controversy over jewelry gifted to her by the royal family of Bahrain. But her new patronage will give her plenty of outlets for do-gooding. Sophie will be working on the college's Better Lives campaign to ""drive change, build a sustainable future and improve wellbeing,"" according to the Telegraph.

A big U.S. study published in the Thursday, Nov. 22, 2012 New England Journal of Medicine shows that mammograms have done surprisingly little to catch deadly cancers before they spread. At the same time, they have led more than a million women to be treated for growths that never would have threatened their lives. (AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf1db240000310094e209.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Julie SteenhuysenCHICAGO, March 18 (Reuters) - In the latest installment in the mammogram debate, a new study finds that getting a mammogram every other year instead of annually did not increase the risk of advanced breast cancer in women aged 50 to 74, even in women who use hormone therapy or have dense breasts, factors that increase a woman's cancer risk.The findings, released on Monday by researchers at the University California, San Francisco, support the conclusions of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an influential government panel of health advisers, which in 2009 issued guidelines that said women should have mammograms every other year starting at age 50 rather than annual tests starting at age 40.The controversial recommendations to reduce the frequency and delay the start of mammogram screening were based on studies suggesting the benefits of detecting cancers earlier did not outweigh the risk of false positive results, which needlessly expose women to the anguish of a breast cancer diagnosis and the ordeal of treatment.The matter, however, is not settled. The American Cancer Society still recommends women be screened for breast cancer every year they are in good health starting at age 40, but the group is closely watching studies such as this.""I don't think any one study ought to change everything,"" Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, said in a telephone interview. But he added, ""This is one of several studies that are all pointing in the same direction over the last several years.""Brawley said he did not expect screening recommendations from professional organizations to change in the next year, but he does see doctors moving toward a more personalized approach over the next five years. There may be some women who need to be screened every six months and others every two years depending on their breast density, family history and genetic testing.In the latest study, Dr. Karla Kerlikowske of the University of California, San Francisco, and colleagues wanted to see whether risk factors beyond a woman's age play a role in the decision of when to start mammogram screening.In addition to age, the team considered whether women had dense breast tissue - which has a higher ratio of connective tissue to fat - or took combination estrogen and progesterone hormone therapy for more than five years, both of which can increase the risk of breast cancer.""If you have these risk factors, would it help if you got screened annually vs. every two years?"" said Kerlikowske, whose study was published online in JAMA Internal Medicine.To study this, the team analyzed data from 11,474 women with breast cancer and 922,624 without breast cancer gathered from 1994 to 2008. Even after looking at these other factors, the team found no increased risk of advanced cancer in women 50 to 74 who got a mammogram every other year instead of every year.""It didn't matter whether you screened that group every year or every two years, the risk of advanced disease or having a worse tumor was no different,"" Kerlikowske said. PSYCHOLOGICAL EFFECTSMore frequent screening in these women did result in more false-positive results. Women aged 50 to 74 who had annual mammograms had a 50 percent risk of having a false-positive result over a 10-year period, but a 31 percent risk when they were screened every other year.Studies suggest a false positive can have lasting psychological effects. A March study in the Annals of Family Medicine said, ""Three years after a false-positive nding, women experience psychosocial consequences that range between those experienced by women with a normal mammogram and those with a diagnosis of breast cancer.""Breast density was a factor in younger women, however. When the team looked at screening frequency in women 40 to 49, they found those with extremely dense breasts who were screened every other year had a higher risk of having a more advanced cancer than those who got screened every year. Younger women also were far more likely to have false-positive results and undergo unnecessary procedures.Without getting a mammogram in their 40s, Kerlikowske said, ""women aren't going to know if they have extremely dense breasts.""Among women in their 40s, about 12 percent to 15 percent have extremely dense breast tissue. For these women, Kerlikowske said she recommends that they get a mammogram if they have other risk factors that might put her at risk of breast cancer, including having a first-degree relative that a common term, or just ""close relative""? such as a mother or a sister with breast cancer.""Once we see their breast density is high, we will offer annual mammography,"" she said.The American College of Radiology and the Society of Breast Imaging, groups that represent radiologists, said the study's methodology was flawed because it used early and late breast cancers to determine the outcomes of breast screening rather than more refined measures of tumor size, nodal status and cancer stage, which could determine whether screening detected cancers at an earlier stage.It also faulted the study for not being a closely controlled, randomized clinical trial. The study used data from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, a national mammography screening database that gathers information from community mammography clinics on millions of women.""We're never going to have a randomized study. This is the best in terms of the type of study anyone can actually hope for,"" said Brawley, whose group monitors scores of breast studies from around the world each year. He said such a study would take decades and would be prohibitively expensive.Catching cancers earlier does not always translate into lives saved, according to a November study published in the New England Journal of Medicine by Dr. Gilbert Welch of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy & Clinical Practice in New Hampshire.That study suggested that as many as a third of cancers detected through routine mammograms may not be life-threatening, contradicting the deeply ingrained belief that cancer screening is always good.Kerlikowske said the strength of her study is that it allows researchers to consider other risk factors, such as breast density, allowing doctors to offer women personalized choices about when to start breast cancer screening.""We're trying to move it away from this idea that it all should be based on age. There should be some thoughtfulness to it,"" she said. (Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen; Additional reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Jilian Mincer and Douglas Royalty)"

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's annual report, Expenditures on Children by Families, ""a middle-income family with a child born in 2010 can expect to spend about $226,920 ($286,860 if projected inflation costs are factored in) for food, shelter and other necessities to raise that child over the next 17 years."" That doesn't even include college! The USDA also has a calculator to help you determine what your personal child care costs might add up to. To help you get started, I've created a financial checklist.Here are some things you can do to prepare for the expense of having a child:⬰ Health Insurance - Review your health insurance to make sure it adequately covers the type of check ups and exams you will need as well as the birth. Consider switching insurers (if you have that option) or making adjustments to your coverage before you get pregnant or have children to ensure you have adequate coverage.⬰ Estate Planning - Make sure you have guardianship provisions in place for the care of your new baby. That way, if something were to happen to you, you (not a court) is deciding who is caring for your child. There are other foundational documents such as a Will and Health Care Power of Attorney that you should also have in place. For more information on the subject check out my post titled Estate Planning Basics.⬰ Life Insurance - This is an important tool to protect your family from the financial burden that would result from your death. Another past post of mine, Do I Need Life Insurance?, was devoted entirely to this topic. It examines the types of life insurance, amount to purchase and other key details.⬰ Emergency Fund - A pool of money set aside for a true emergency is one of the most important things you can do to establish financial security. The general rule of thumb is to have three to six months of expenses allocated for this purpose. This becomes even more critical when you have kids. Pad your emergency savings account and bring it up to the full six months or maybe more. If just depends on your own personal comfort level.⬰ Tax Changes - Include the Child Tax Credit when filing your next return. The IRS provides 11 tax tips here.⬰ Spending Adjustments - As noted above, raising a child is expensive. So you'll need to adjust your budget. You might consider cutting back spending before the baby arrives and put those funds towards other checklist items. There are also helpful blogs for parents that include money saving tips and offers such as A Busy Mom Of Two.⬰ College Savings - There are a number of college savings vehicles, but the most important factor is saving early and often. 529 College Savings Accounts are offered by each state. They have some restrictions; for instance, money can only be used for the cost of higher education, but they also have tax advantages. In order to be most effective, open an account when your child is young. Also, encourage friends and family to contribute to this account for holidays and birthdays in lieu of other gifts.Check off the items on this list to prepare as much as possible for the latest addition to your family and continue to SaveUp!This post was written by SaveUp's personal finance contributing writer, Catherine Hawley, CFP®."

Why not right now? The UN has declared March 20, 2013 to be the first International Day of Happiness. Why happiness now? More and more, people are asking what is the definition of human ""progress,"" and recognizing that it must include happiness and well-being, not just bottom line economic growth. The good news is that it that you don't need to go searching for the secret happiness sauce -- you already have everything you need to ignite happiness within yourself and influence those around you. Exercise your happiness; this is your day! History:  International Day of Happiness gained momentum after the Hon. Jigme Thinley of Bhutan, the country that pioneered the concept of Gross National Happiness, inspired the Assembly to introduce a UN Resolution to consider the greater happiness of a country's citizens. In an unforgettable conversation we shared at the Rio+ Conference, he spoke of his goal of countries coming together in a new vision for global happiness, which starts with each individual. Inspired by Bhutan's call to action, a UN conference on happiness and well-being was held, leading to 193 countries to unanimously sanction the equinox day of March 20 as the first International Day of Happiness. Now the world is on board and you can be too!How to Get Involved? While nations are gradually introducing happiness and well-being as an important part of sustainable development, it's exciting to see that individual citizens are mobilizing to take their happiness into their own hands too. Project Happiness, which teaches the skills for greater well-being to students around the world, is working with Action for Happiness, an organization based in the UK, that is bringing together a network of like-minded organizations and people to expand happiness everywhere. One of the quickest ways to get involved is to celebrate acts of generosity, kindness, enthusiasm and connection -- focused on bringing happiness to others. It's easier than one may think to ACT: A: Affirm the pledge -- make a personal pledge to create more happiness in the world C: Cheer Happy Heroes -- celebrate the people who bring happiness to you and others T: Take part -- do something to mark the day and spread some happiness Wherever you are in the world you can take part on the International Day of Happiness by: • Cheering your Happy Heroes or using the #happyheroes hashtag on Twitter • Sharing what you're doing on the day using Cheers or the #happyday hashtag on Twitter.Because your sense of well-being influences others more than you know, it makes sense that as you increase your happiness, it positively affects those around you. Why not make International Happiness Day the start of a year where you commit to well-being, positivity and gratitude? It will uplift your outlook and ripple out to those you care about too. You know about the benefits of exercise, sleep and food that give you energy. Here are a few other ideas to get started. The cost is nothing but your desire, and the pay offs are enormous:5 Ways to Activate Your Happiness:1. Kindness Counts: Research shows that people who did five acts of kindness per week over six weeks experienced increased happiness and other positive consequences. You don't have to practice this every day to discover that being kind to others makes you happier. When has this shown up for you? 2. Time for Happiness: Rather than linking money and happiness, we are better off examining the relationship between time and happiness in our lives. We can be happier by following these time-spending happiness rules: ""1) spend time with the right people; 2) spend time on the right activities; 3) be aware that happiness changes over time."" What times in your life have brought you unforgettable happiness?3. Feel the Flow: When hours feel like minutes and you are totally absorbed in what you are doing, you are in a ""flow"" state. Athletes call it being ""in the zone."" Research shows that flow state happens when you have the right ratio of challenge to skill level, i.e., when you're challenged just enough to engage your skill set at the appropriate level. What makes you feel that way?4. Mindset Matters: When something bad happens you can either choose to put yourself down and succumb to the ""inner critic"" or look into what there is to learn from the situation. If a presentation didn't go well, you can either say: ""I'm always bad at this type of thing"" (Dr. Carol Dweck calls this the fixed mindset) or: ""It happens; next time I'll prepare and practice more,"" (the growth mindset). Which perspective will you choose?5. Count Your Blessings: Practicing gratitude and visualizing your best positive self help increase and sustain positive emotion. Those making daily gratitude lists (even 1-3 things that you are grateful for) reported levels of alertness, enthusiasm, determination, optimism and energy. Worth a shot? Make International Day of Happiness your personal day to celebrate the happiness already in your life, expand on that and share it with others. Think of it as fuel for a better world. Research shows that happiness is contagious, and even small acts create big ripples of change. You are the change you've been waiting for.
