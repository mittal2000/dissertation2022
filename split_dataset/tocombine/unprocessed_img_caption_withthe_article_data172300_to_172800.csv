What are the the tolls of new temptations?,2012-11-10,Loving affectionate nude heterosexual couple on bed.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c80ec240000310094b3de.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Research shows women may be cheating now almost as much as men. What are the tolls of new temptations?Some 60 years ago, Alfred Kinsey delivered a shock to mid century sexual sensibilities when he reported that at some point in their marriages, half of the men and a quarter of the women in the U.S. had an extramarital affair. No one puts much stock in Dr. Kinsey's high numbers any more -- his sampling methods suffered from a raging case of selection bias -- but his results fit the long-standing assumption that men are much more likely to cheat than women. Lately, however, researchers have been raising doubts about this view: They believe that the incidence of unfaithfulness among wives may be approaching that of husbands. The lasting costs of these betrayals will be familiar to the many Americans who have experienced divorce as spouses or children. Among the most reliable studies on this issue is the General Social Survey, sponsored by the National Science Foundation, which has been asking Americans the same questions since 1972. In the 2010 survey, 19 percent of men said that they had been unfaithful at some point during their marriages, down from 21 percent in 1991. Women who reported having an affair increased from 11 percent in 1991 to 14 percent in 2010. A 2011 study conducted by Indiana University, the Kinsey Institute and the University of Guelph found much less of a divide: 23 percent for men and 19 percent for women. Such numbers suggest the disappearance of the infidelity gender gap, but some caution is in order. An enduring problem for researchers -- even those who sample with meticulous care -- is that any such survey is asking for confessions from people who are presumably lying to their spouses. Researchers generally believe that actual infidelity numbers are higher than the results indicate.It should also be emphasized that cheating in the U.S. isn't epidemic or inevitable, for either sex. Surveys consistently find that by far the majority of respondents value monogamy and think that infidelity is harmful. And if you believe the General Social Survey's finding that 14 percent of women are cheating, keep in mind that 86 percent aren't.Still, even though survey accuracy is difficult to achieve and experts are by no means unanimous, it would appear that women are, indeed, catching up. In my own work as a psychologist and in my social circle, I see more women not only having affairs but actively seeking them out. Their reasons are familiar: validation of their attractiveness, emotional connection, appreciation, ego -- not to mention the thrill of a shiny new relationship, unburdened by the long slog through the realities of coupledom.Researchers also point to other factors that might be leading women to stray more. One is what might be called ""infidelity overload."" Scan the plots on any given week in television, and there seems to be more extramarital sex than marital sex. (Few spouses stay put in Mad Men.) With women portrayed as eager participants and aggressive instigators, there may be a feeling that infidelity has become more acceptable. And then there is the opportunity factor -- more travel, more late nights on the job and more interaction with men mean that the chances and temptations to stray have multiplied for the new generation of working women.A 2011 study at Tilburg University in the Netherlands, published in the journal Psychological Science, argues that infidelity is also a function of greater economic and social power, which creates confidence and personal leverage for both genders. Women can now use their power in ways to which men have long been accustomed.A broader cultural shift may also be at work. According to a Match.com study conducted earlier this year by the biological anthropologist Helen Fisher, women are becoming less traditional about relationships. Men, interestingly, may be going the other direction. In the survey, 77 percent of women in a committed relationship said they needed personal space, as opposed to 58 percent of men. While 35 percent of women wanted regular nights out with friends, only 23 percent of men said the same. Social networks are another factor, if only by expanding the pool of possible partners. Emotional friendships that turn physical are the traditional point of entry for female affairs. It is now easy for those friendships to take root online. Some argue that social networks are merely an expediter and that cheaters will always find a way. Still, if you've never quite gotten over your prom date, today the chances are much better that you can find him.Do women account for more of today's affairs? Probably. But in a society that has been preaching, legislating and celebrating gender equality for decades, equality in marital misdeeds might be expected too.Dr. Drexler is an assistant professor of psychology in psychiatry at Weill Cornell Medical College and author, most recently, of ""Our Fathers, Ourselves: Daughters, Fathers and the Changing American Family.""

Others don't see things this way.",2012-11-10,"Religion, death and dolor - coffin bearer carrying casket at funeral to cemetery",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb35bc61f00002e0123d685.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My grandfather died on Halloween. Thanks to Hurricane Sandy, none of the New York family members could attend the funeral in Massachusetts. Fortunately, another option became available: The ceremony was streamed online, and so my wife, daughter and I gathered around a laptop in our living room to watch the live webcast.The rabbi began by giving technology center stage, poignantly acknowledging that the virtual participants played an important role in honoring the deceased's memory. After that, technology receded into the background for the Massachusetts crowd. My grandmother looked like a bereaved widow. Online coverage didn't affect her demeanor -- or anyone else's.At my house, however, things were different. The technology raised all sorts of problems and questions.For starters, there was the initial hurdle of gaining access to the webcast. A password was needed, and we were initially sent the wrong one. After conceding the mistake, the woman in charge of the set-up said that we could just catch the archived footage later on. She was trying to be helpful, but the digital convenience of it all felt completely out of place, as if we were making plans to watch a favorite sitcom later on DVR.Once the technical difficulty got resolved, we confronted a host of unfamiliar issues of protocol and decorum. Rory, my six-year-old daughter, wanted to know if she could eat while watching. In person, obviously, chomping while prayers were offered would be distracting and frowned upon. But was it actually rude here? And, if we allowed it, would we be implicitly sending her the message that this wasn't a somber occasion?When Rory let out a loud ""Yes!"" followed by an enthusiastic hand gesture as the rabbi said her name when listing the decedents, we weren't sure what to say. Since the enthusiasm was contained to our house, did the inappropriateness matter?And what about Rory's constant barrage of questions? They interrupted our focus, but she posed them urgently, saying that she wouldn't remember her questions later. Since the funeral would be archived for 30 days, we knew that whatever we missed could be seen later. We certainly wouldn't have been as indulgent had we been there in person.My wife and I were also challenged by having to participate by webcast. Viewing everything from home, we felt distant from the choreographed gestures. We didn't feel inclined to rise when the other mourners did. We didn't even try to say the prayers aloud.When the ceremony ended, we quickly returned to our daily routine. Not being physically present for the funeral, we didn't feel the usual need to reflect, or the usual sympathy and sorrow. We didn't pass by other mourners and exchange condolences. We didn't have the spine-tingling feeling that comes from being near a casket containing a beloved relative. We didn't line up in a funeral procession. While the webcast had a visceral impact, I suspect it would have been even greater had we been there in person. Perhaps more oxytocin would be released. It would be a mistake, though, to say that the webcast dehumanized or even sullied the experience. Convenience always comes with costs, and we didn't feel that the sacred had been sacrificed for the expedient. Our emotional attunement was limited, but we weren't desensitized. And it was certainly better than not being present at all.The fact is, rituals change over time, including rituals of mourning. Dr. Sherry Schachter, Director of Bereavement Services at Calvary Hospital, happens to be my mom, and she reminded me that two events stand out in recent history. In the 1980s, the AIDS quilt originated as a grief driven response by disenfranchised people looking to transcend the insular, private norms of traditional memorial services. After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, mourners turned a variety of public surfaces, from sidewalks to street corners, into memorial shrines. Far from being a settled matter, the appropriateness of public displays of grief is now being debated in the context of social media. Some applaud live-tweeting a funeral for extending the circle of participation. Others don't see things this way. They find the commentary intrusive. As the novelty fades, I suspect the resistance will as well.Of course knowing future shock will be short lived doesn't always help in the present. Over the summer, I gave the best man's speech at my brother's wedding. After reading stories about a hospitalized groom getting married over Skype, folks updating their Facebook statuses and texting while walking down the aisle, and a bridesmaid making an iPad appearance at a wedding, I thought nobody would mind if I read my remarks from an iPhone instead of piece of paper. Turned out, I was wrong. Friends and family were horrified, and I couldn't bring myself to disappoint them, even knowing that in a few years most won't bat an eye if this happens as a regular occurrence. Traditional funerals, weddings, and other ritualized ceremonies are intimate encounters that revolve around cherished norms. People readily take offense at perceived violations, but perhaps the time has come to be more open to change. As the digital age continues to expand, new rituals will emerge, confronting us, time and again, with the question of whether old ways are enhanced, diminished or simply altered by new ones.*An abbreviated version of this article appeared in The Wall Street Journal on November 6, 2012."

The storm brought gusting winds, rain, and snow and forced the cancelation of flights for thousands of passengers flying into and out of JFK, LaGuardia and Newark. (Photo by Allison Joyce/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb126ed240000500096aec2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Co-authored with Lydia BallStories of luck are mainly what we have as we all recover from Sandy. A neighbor, trudging through waist deep water with her dogs ""swimming for their lives,"" thinking that she might never make it the next half mile to dry ground, was rescued almost magically by two men in survival suits. Another friend, on 22nd Street in New York City, was almost drowned in his own art studio when the tidal surge burst through his door, washing him to the back of the studio and submerging him. A fire sparked by floodwater-shorted electrical wires destroyed almost 100 homes. Thousands remain without power. Indeed, thousands remain without homes. Many are hurting terribly.But the intensity of the storm wasn't just bad luck. This storm wasn't caused by climate change. But climate change intensifies weather. And it intensifies hurricanes. The damage, also, wasn't just bad luck. We love to live close to the shore. We filled many wetlands that once took the brunt of surges and overflow. We have built our homes, our businesses and our public buildings right up to the edge of the tumultuous sea that we all so dearly love.  Photo by Carl Safina.Should those affected rebuild with help from the federal government? Or should this storm be the game-changer?Last July, President Obama signed a $105 billion bill that made changes to the National Flood Insurance program. This bill requires the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), which administers the National Flood Insurance program, to update floodplain maps and adjust federal flood insurance premiums to reflect real risks. Additionally, the new law seeks to remove vacation homes and repeat claims from federal insurance protections. Liberal officials support these measures because they acknowledge the trends of climate change. Conservatives support the law as it cuts federal spending. This is a good start, but Hurricane Sandy reminded us that we must keep reforming the federal flood insurance in order to fully deal with climate change.Since its creation in 1968, the National Flood Insurance program has offered lower rates than private sector insurance companies, to encourage development of coastal and flood-prone areas. The private sector offers either high premiums or simply refuses coverage in many of these areas. As climate change effects are felt, Americans must adapt, to avoid large-scale tragedies. By encouraging people to live in flood-prone areas, federal insurance encourages risky development at taxpayers' expense. Federal flood insurance, at this point, should be used to relocate rather than to rebuild. Otherwise we are going to run into the same issues again and again. If we choose to live in a flood-prone area, we get private flood insurance or simply take our chances and prepare for the worst.Some government officials would like the Federal Emergency Management Agency to buy private sector reinsurance, which could possibly help shift the federal flood insurance away from the public and into the private sector. When the latest transportation bill was signed, the Federal Emergency Management Agency was $18 billion in debt. Sandy has raised this number even closer to the debt cap of $20.8 billion. It is time to end this loser.Federal dollars and federal flood insurance should ensure that people who live in flood-prone areas don't rebuild in the same location. Of course, this can be done with compassion, assisting those currently insured in relocating away from floodplains.Sandy may be a ""freak occurrence."" But we should expect more freak occurrences. Weather is no longer typical. Choices are no longer easy."

The goal has always been to tailor treatment to each case in order to provide therapies for, and offer various kinds of surgery to, those who would benefit -- sparing others from the side effects, both medical and surgical, if they personally had nothing to gain. In the war against breast cancer, physicians want to leave behind the shotgun approach against cancer cells -- bullets shot everywhere at everyone, so normal cells suffer much collateral damage and some individuals derive no benefit. We look forward to the development of a sniper's rifle with a laser scope and a single bullet that zeroes in precisely on the enemy.The medical and surgical fronts have seen significant progress toward this goal since the 1970s and 1980s. Our medical oncology colleagues and researchers have discovered and developed targeted agents that have played a major role in increasing survival rates for breast cancer among those for whom these agents are active. Examples of this include:• Tamoxifen, which can help reduce the risk of dying from breast cancer by 40 to 50 percent in women whose tumors are fed by estrogen (hormone-receptor positive).• Herceptin, a major advance in treating one of the most aggressive subsets of breast cancer: tumors that overexpress a receptor called Her2/neu. Prior to the development of Herceptin, patients with Her2/neu positive disease (approximately 15 to 20 percent of all patients with breast cancer) had a much poorer prognosis than those who were Her2/neu negative. With Herceptin, which targets the Her2/neu pathway, women with Her2/neu-positive breast cancer can now expect excellent survival rates.The same advancement has happened in the arena of surgery. Prior to the 1970s and 1980s, the treatment for breast cancer was a radical mastectomy. It was the only option for breast cancer surgery, and one size fit all. This operation, associated with disfigurement, significant limits to range of motion, and a high risk of arm swelling called lymphedema, was the only proven way to get all the cancer out. In the 1980s, as smaller tumors were detected with mammography, leaders in breast surgery conducting clinical trials around the world were able to show that lumpectomy -- removing only a small portion of the breast and then giving radiation -- provided survival rates equal to those of mastectomy, with minimal risk of recurrence in the breast. With the advent of breast-conserving surgery, more women had a choice, and the surgical approach was tailored to the size and extent of the individual woman's cancer. In the 1990s, sentinel node biopsy was developed; this procedure allowed us to check lymph nodes under the arm, usually the first site of cancer spread, without removing them all, thereby performing a much shorter, smaller operation, with fewer long-term risks of lymphedema, for women whose lymph nodes were normal. This more targeted approach spared women with normal lymph notes a larger, more aggressive surgery, while surgeons continued to perform aggressive surgery for those with positive nodes, for whom it was potentially beneficial.Most recently, a large clinical trial has shown that even in some women with positive nodes, total lymph node removal may not be necessary or beneficial. This is another example of progress in chiseling away and further defining subsets of women who will or will not benefit from more or less surgery. So, in terms of our weaponry, we have moved past the shotgun approach but have not yet reached the sniper's rifle.The research presented in a paper, recently published in Nature by the Cancer Genome Atlas Network, shines a light on some of the many pathways toward the next generation of individualized cancer treatment strategies. This paper demonstrates that cancer is not just one disease but essentially can be characterized as four different subtypes, each of which behaves biologically differently. By elucidating the mechanisms and complex pathways associated with the different types of breast cancer, we have the potential to take targeted therapy to the next level by identifying new targets. For example, one particular subtype of breast cancer looks remarkably like ovarian cancer from the standpoint of genetic profile. Could this insight mean that perhaps drugs that have traditionally worked in ovarian cancer may be of benefit to this particular subset of breast cancer patients?In the last decades we have made much progress toward identifying and characterizing the pathways that lead to cancer development, but we also know that we have only just skimmed the surface of potential targeted therapy. A greater and more detailed understanding of what the driving factors are for cancer development will pave the way for designing treatments that specifically target these driving factors. Stay tuned for the next generation of cancer treatments: for each woman with breast cancer, a sniper's rifle with a laser scope aimed at her particular cancer.This post originally appeared on Women's Voices for Change.For more on breast cancer, click here.
