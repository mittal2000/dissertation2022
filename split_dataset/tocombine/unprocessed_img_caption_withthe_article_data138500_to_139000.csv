""I can help you!"" she says. We go over to the aisle and I point to the one that to me has the best picture, even though it's 720p, as opposed to 1080p. ""I'm not married to the idea of the highest numbers,"" I say, ""Some of my best pictures were made with four- or five-megapixel cameras and blown up big!"" As I do with many I meet, I ask about her heritage, if she doesn't mind saying, out of genuine curiosity. By her look I think she might say Indian, or possibly Sri Lankan, but she lists off four countries in the Caribbean and South America as components of her heritage. ""That must make for some good food!"" I say. She smiles big. ""It sure does!"" I tell her how I know ""thank you"" in many languages. She asks me a few. ""How about Japanese?"" ""Arrigato... do you know how to say 'you're welcome?'"" ""Dou itashimashite."" she says. Then she tells me the memory trick for it that my Japanese client told me long ago: ""Don't touch my mustache."" I then ask about her career and life aspirations, again out of curiosity and care. She doesn't reply with a specific career choice but instead with this unique thoughtful response: ""I want to find something I enjoy doing that gives me stability and enables me to raise children in a good way."" I'm impressed and edified by what she's said. I tell her about Kindsight, it's origin, and how stories are made with pictures and words from random encounters and moments. She likes this, so I ask ""Are you up for an assignment?"" ""Yes,"" she smiles. I give her my business card to check out sample Kindsight pieces, I explain parameters and give her a deadline of three weeks to get me her own finished Kindsight piece. ""I'll get it to you in one week!"" she beams. ""Even better! Can we make a photo?"" I ask. ""I kind of wish you had done it without asking,"" she says. ""Okay, don't worry,"" I say. I pay and per Christina's instructions, I go to pull my van around to the front of the store so she can load the TV inside. Once done, she says ""I made this for you."" It's a long piece of cash register paper with ""Don't touch my Mustache"" written in pink magic marker. I can't help but smile. ""Arrigato!"" I say. ""I'll be looking out for your assignment!"" She heads back inside and I drive home, enriched by the treasure of our kind encounter."

4,BLACK VOICES,Lack Of Black Women On 'Saturday Night Live' Becomes Major Issue,"The Associated Press, The Associated Press",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/snl-black-women_us_5badf390e4b0bb1705fba57f,"The show still is an important part of the culture, and misses something when there's a lack of diversity, she said. She",2013-11-03,"FILE - In this Oct. 29, 2013, file photo released by NBC, actress Kerry Washington, right, stands with cast member Taran Killam during a promotional shoot for ""Saturday Night Live,"" in New York. After receiving criticism recently for its lack of a black female cast member, the show on Saturday, Nov. 2, 2013, opened with a skit where guest host Washington portrayed Michelle Obama, then Oprah Winfrey. She was asked to change into a Beyonce outfit - before executive producer Lorne Michaels stepped in. (AP Photo/NBC, Dana Edelson, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badf3903c000032000b56e3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK (AP) — Kerry Washington's turn as host of ""Saturday Night Live"" this week gives that television institution something it hasn't seen much lately: a black woman onstage trying to make people laugh.The show's diversity has become an issue, pushed to the forefront by comments from the two black male cast members.No black women are among the 16 repertory or featured players currently on the show. While Eddie Murphy, Garrett Morris, Chris Rock, Tim Meadows, Tracy Morgan and current cast members Kenan Thompson and Jay Pharoah have been major ""SNL"" players, the 137 people who have been cast members since the show started on NBC in 1975 include four black women.The most recent, and most prominent, was biracial Maya Rudolph, who left in 2007.Founding producer Lorne Michaels, who is still the show's top executive and generally keeps the casting process mysterious, said he's well aware of the issue and is on the lookout for black women as potential cast members.""It's not like it's not a priority for us,"" he said in an interview with The Associated Press on Thursday night. ""It will happen. I'm sure it will happen.""Pharoah told the website The Grio recently that he hoped the show would have a black woman in its cast, and he had a suggestion: Darmirra Brunson.""Why do I think she should be on the show?"" he said. ""Because she's black, first of all, and she's really talented. She's amazing. She needs to be on 'SNL.'""It's not clear whether she was ever considered, although it's currently a moot point. Brunson is a cast member on Tyler Perry's show, ""Love Thy Neighbor,"" on Oprah Winfrey's OWN network.Thompson, who Michaels said is as good as anyone who's been on the show, blamed a lack of quality black comediennes. ""It's just a tough part of the business, like in auditions,"" he told TV Guide. ""They never find ones that are ready.""That didn't go over well in the comedy community, with several people coming forth with suggestions for Thompson. ""It was kind of an unfortunate, unthinking thing to say,"" said Miriam Petty, a Northwestern University communications professor and expert on black popular culture.Sketch comedy troupes like Second City, the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and the Groundlings are fertile ground for future cast members. Current players pass along recommendations, like when Tina Fey touted Amy Poehler. There are often specific needs: ""SNL"" was particularly seeking men this year because Jason Sudeikis, Fred Armisen and Bill Hader left the show, and Seth Meyers is soon to graduate to his own weeknight show.Michaels said ""SNL"" is particularly interested in sketch comedy experience, a different skill than stand-up. He also wants to make sure that a new cast member has some seasoning and won't be overwhelmed by the pace and attention.""You don't do anyone a favor if they're not ready,"" he said.Two of the black women who were on the show — Danitra Vance and Yvonne Hudson — lasted only one season each during the 1980s, although Michaels said that wasn't necessarily an indication they weren't ready. The third black woman cast member, Ellen Cleghorne, was on from 1991 to 1995.There has often been criticism through the years that late-night comedy in general is a boy's club, particularly a white boy's club (There aren't any Asians or Hispanics on the show either, male or female, though cast member Nasim Pedrad is Iranian-American).Petty said she didn't think there was a conscious effort to be exclusionary on ""Saturday Night Live."" ''But when most of the people in the boardroom (making casting decisions) are white men, that's going to happen,"" she said.The show still is an important part of the culture, and misses something when there's a lack of diversity, she said. She cited political humor as something that would benefit from different perspectives.Discussing the issue on Roland Martin's radio show recently, comic Kym Whitley wryly noted, ""They do have sisters on there — they're just brothers playing sisters.""Not anymore. Both Thompson and Pharoah are balking now at performing in drag. They won't put on wigs, makeup or dresses to portray Oprah Winfrey or Whoopi Goldberg, for example.Performing in drag has been a contentious issue among black comics, even as people like Perry and Flip Wilson portrayed signature female characters. Having men portray women frequently turns them into cartoonish or stereotypical characters, said Darnell Hunt, a sociology professor and director of the Ralph J. Bunche Center for African American Studies at UCLA.""You are almost locked into certain types of portrayals of black women, if you have them at all,"" Hunt said.___http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/___EDITOR'S NOTE — David Bauder can be reached at dbauder@ap.org or on Twitter@dbauder.

(AP Photo/Damian Dovarganes, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3012a2500009400389a60.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Following in the footsteps of colleagues in New York and Chicago, employees at a Guitar Center store in Las Vegas voted on Friday to unionize. If the federal labor board ratifies the election, the store will be the third location in the Bain Capital-owned music equipment chain to go union this year.The workers voted 14 to 5 in favor of joining the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union, according to union officials. Guitar Center's flagship store in Manhattan became the chain's first union shop earlier this year. That election was followed by two unsuccessful union bids in Brooklyn and Queens, and another successful one in Chicago. Union officials said they will continue trying to organize Guitar Center workers around the country, especially given the apparent victory at Town Square in Las Vegas.Doug Simpson, the employee who spearheaded the union effort at the Vegas location, said he hoped a union contract could ultimately lead to better job security, better health benefits and more ""respect"" from management. Simpson said he reached out to RWDSU after his wife read about the Manhattan shop's vote earlier this year.""It feels really good, like there's hope to turn this into a decent job,"" said Simpson, 58, a salesperson in the audio department. ""It all boiled down to a lack of respect and the company trying to get more out of us for less money.""Dennis Haffeman, vice president of human resources at Guitar Center, said the RWDSU campaign was about generating money for the union. He said the company recently revised its compensation and benefits packages, raising base pay and adding four paid holidays for workers at non-union stores. The company is keeping the status quo at the union shops out of respect for the bargaining process, Haffeman said, not to punish workers there. ""RWDSU is campaigning not just with us but elsewhere. They have a business model that they need to maintain,"" he said. ""We've made so many substantive change that have been really exciting.""As HuffPost reported before the Manhattan vote, some Guitar Center employees said they believed working conditions at the retailer had declined since it was purchased for $2.1 billion by Bain in 2007. Several complained to HuffPost specifically about the pay system: Salespeople earn a modest base pay, plus commission, but don't see any commission unless they hit a certain amount of sales -- a process known as ""fading"" against the base pay. Workers also said they felt pressured by management to sell additional product warranties, which are profitable for retailers but can be a difficult sell to wary shoppers.After the unionization of the Chicago store, Guitar Center said it was in the process of raising the base pay for many workers, though the chain noted it had started that process before it became aware of the union campaign. Whereas workers typically earned a base pay of roughly the minimum wage before, many of them have been bumped up to around $9 or $9.50.The average median pay for a retail salesperson -- now the most common job in America -- was $20,990 in 2010, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Many such workers don't have basic benefits like paid sick days, and can't afford the employer-based health coverage they're offered. Due to the industry's high turnover rate, workers in retail can be notoriously difficult to organize for labor activists. Guitar Center workers, however, are something of a different case. The employees there tend to be musicians themselves, many of them hoping their day job can underwrite their music careers at night. According to Phil Andrews, RWDSU's director of retail organizing, this common bond has been crucial throughout the unionization effort, as management and company consultants try to persuade workers not to vote union. ""[Retail] jobs by design are low wage and high turnover. People don't have a strong commitment to it,"" said Andrews, who's a musician himself, in the band Gay Panic. ""In this case, these folks are friends outside of work. They have similar dreams. They support each other. They go to each others' shows. When we met them, we saw that's the way it works.""Workers at the Manhattan and Chicago stores are currently negotiating their first contracts. RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum previously told HuffPost that he thought the grievances of the Guitar Center employees who voted union were emblematic of broader trends in the retail industry, as well as of the economy at large. ""The campaign is important because it typifies what has happened in our economy, where it's workers bearing the brunt of Bain's acquisition desires,"" Appelbaum said. ""I think that what happens to workers at Guitar Center is symbolic of what's happening to retail workers across the country ... Every retail worker should be concerned about this fight."" "

However, according to a recent survey, women do not benefit nearly as much as men. The U.S. ranked 23rd in the world for gender equality, behind countries including South Africa, Cuba, and the Philippines.The World Economic Forum (WEF) report, the 2013 Global Gender Gap Report, measured the disparities between men and women in 136 countries. In the nations that scored the worst, economic and educational opportunities, as well as political representation and health outcomes, were far worse for women than for men. According to the report, Iceland was the best country for gender equality, while Yemen was the worst. 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 10 nations with the worst gender-based inequality.(Click here to see the Most Unfair Countries For Women)The world’s worst countries for gender inequality consistently failed to provide the same education opportunities for women that were available for men. Five of these nations were among the bottom 10 countries measured for equality of educational attainment.According to the most recently available data, just 49% of Yemeni women and 40% of Pakistani women were literate, compared to 82% and 69% of men, respectively. Last year, the Pakistani Taliban shot teenager Malala Yousafzai for actively promoting girls’ right to an education. She survived and was nominated for this year’s Nobel Peace Prize for her activism.Women in countries with extreme gender inequality frequently also lack representation in political office. Women accounted for at least 20% of parliament in only three of the 10 worst nations. In Yemen, there are no female members of parliament. Only one of these nations, Pakistan, has had a female head of state in the last 50 years. Pakistan’s former prime minister, Benazir Bhutto — the sole woman to lead any of these countries — was assassinated in 2007.While the rank is based on the inequality between men and women, the nations also tended to among the worst countries for women overall. Nine of them had among the world’s worst labor force participation rates. Similarly, in half of the nations more than half of all women were illiterate, according to the latest available data.24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 10 nations that received the worst score in the World Economic Forum’s 2013 Global Gender Gap Report. Each country was graded based on its score in four key areas: economic participation and opportunity; educational attainment; health and survival; and political empowerment. Countries scored worse by each measure when the gap between men and women for that measure was the widest. For example, women in Yemen do not have the lowest literacy rate in the world, but the gap between men and women by that measure is the widest, so Yemen received the lowest score for literacy. At the time the WEF produced their study all figures represented the most recently available data.Here are the most unfair countries for women according to 24/7 Wall St.:"
