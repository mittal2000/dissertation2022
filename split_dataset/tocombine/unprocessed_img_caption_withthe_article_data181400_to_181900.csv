The couple has decided to postpone their wedding until next summer because of Rounds's illness, O'Donnell wrote on her blog. ""Desmoid tumors, odd and curious beasts, strong and sneaky, a non cancer that acts cancerous,"" O'Donnell wrote on her blog. ""Only 900 cases a year in the US, an orphan disease -- beyond rare, only 3 people per million get this, michelle is one of them."" According to the Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation, desmoid tumors -- also known as aggressive fibromatoses -- are considered benign, but that doesn't mean they aren't dangerous because they grow quickly just like cancer. The tumors grow in the soft connective tissue in the body, but can also spread to other nearby tissues and organs, the Mayo Clinic reported. They can even grow into bone. Desmoid tumors are most common in men and in people between the ages of older childhood up until the 40s, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons. Symptoms usually include feeling some sort of lump -- sometimes painful -- in the arm or leg. However, symptoms can become more severe -- limiting mobility -- depending on where the tumors grow. The location of the tumors could also bring up other health concerns. For example, if the tumors form in the abdomen, it could lead to rectal bleeding or other GI symptoms, according to the Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation.The tumors are diagnosed with imaging tests like ultrasound, MRI or CT scans, or with a biopsy, according to the Mayo Clinic. Surgery is usually the best way to remove desmoid tumors, the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons reported, though radiation therapy and drugs (like NSAIDs and Cox II inhibitors) could also help.

I often hear something like this from prospective clients:""I'm not sure that I want a divorce. Things have been bad for a while, but I am still hanging on. Sometimes I feel like it is over, but then I think of the kids, our house, our life. Is divorce really worth it?Your attorney is not there to convince you that your spouse is worthless, abusive or lacking in everything that you find valuable and good in this world, and they should never try to convince you that you need to leave your spouse if you are unsure.If you can't decide if divorce is worth it, you probably need to consult with a marital counselor instead of an attorney. However, bear in mind that a marriage counselor or family therapist advocates for the relationship -- the unit of both husband and wife, together.If you want a counselor that advocates for you and for your best interests as an individual, then I recommend that you find a therapist who does cognitive behavioral therapy or psychotherapy. Be sure to check whether mental health coverage is available on your health insurance plan and then find a provider inside your network. You can likely get a good referral from your family physician.Above all, focus on your family and what you need to do to preserve it. Consider your choice very carefully, and be sure to get the facts about what divorce entails before you pursue it. If you have children, you need to realize that you will most likely remain co-parents with your spouse after the divorce. You may not love your spouse anymore, but he or she will remain a part of your life until the kids are out of the house.Even if you are not sure what you should do, consider meeting with an attorney to discuss your options. Definitely find an attorney who is focused on family law, not a generalist who would take a criminal case or traffic ticket just as readily as a divorce. This is one of the most challenging roads that you will ever walk; be sure that you have an experienced guide to lead the way.If divorce is on your mind, here are 10 simple true-or-false questions to ask yourself before splitting:1. True or False: In the last six months, my spouse has changed their exercise, dress and grooming regime to look younger or fitter.2. True or False: I have not had sex with my spouse in over one month.3. True or False: I suspect that my spouse is cheating.4. True or False: I can't remember the last time sex was good.5. True or False: I can't remember why I married my spouse in the first place.6. True or False: I don't have access to the marital accounts, or the access that I have is very limited.7. True or False: I am currently involved in a romantic relationship with someone other than my spouse.8. True or False: My spouse has been diagnosed with a mental disorder/disease and fails to seek counseling or medical treatment.9. True or False: My spouse has an addiction to drugs, alcohol, porn, gambling, shopping, etc. but fails to seek treatment to address the addiction.10. True or False: We fight more than we laugh.If you answered TRUE to 1 or 2 questions, you are probably in need of some marital counseling or a good, old-fashioned date night with your spouse that includes a heart-to-heart conversation.If you answered TRUE to 2-5 questions, your marriage is salvageable but will take a lot of work. You need to ask yourself, ""Does my desire to fix this marriage outweigh my exhaustion at trying to do so?"" If so, then you should explore marital counseling. It is also advisable to consult with a lawyer just to ensure that you know your rights.If you answered TRUE to more than 5 questions, contact a family attorney."

HSBC PLC is to take a $700 million charge to cover the cost of U.S. fines arising from its failure to stamp out money-laundering at the bank. The provision was announced as the bank reported an 11 percent gain in pretax profit in the first half of the year, boosted by $4.3 billion in gains from asset sales. (AP Photo/Vincent Yu)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2ccb53c000020010c33fc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bloomberg View:To grow up in South Florida during the 1970s and 1980s, as I did, wasn’t your typical American childhood experience. Back then the area was known as the most dangerous place in the country.Carnage from the drug wars filled the local news long before “Miami Vice” became a hit TV show. By elementary school, my friends and I knew some of the lingo. A Colombian necktie wasn’t a piece of clothing, but a gruesome execution method. When I was 7 years old my barber was murdered in his shop, apparently over a drug deal.It had been a long time since I thought much about those days. By chance I recently came across a fabulous documentary, “Cocaine Cowboys,” by Miami filmmaker Billy Corben. Then last month a Senate panel held a hearing on the U.K. bank HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) and its ties to drug lords, money laundering, al- Qaeda and rogue nations such as Iran and North Korea.Here’s a bank with $2.7 trillion of assets that flouted U.S. laws for a decade, according to the July 17 report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. HSBC turned a blind eye to organized crime, Mexican drug cartels and overseas terrorism financiers, and gave them access to the U.S. banking system. HSBC’s main U.S. regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, for years tolerated its violations of anti-money laundering laws.For this, HSBC and the OCC apologized. Justice Department fines are likely. It’s an outrage HSBC hasn’t had its U.S. banking licenses revoked, assuming the Senate panel’s report is accurate -- and there’s no reason to believe it isn’t.Try ThisLet’s try out a novel idea: Banks that help drug cartels launder money and give cover to those tied to terrorism should be put out of business. Is that really so hard for everyone to agree on? Free markets have worked in the U.S. because we have the rule of law. It’s why so many investors from other countries want to do business here. When contracts are breached, courts can be accessed to enforce them. When individuals or companies commit crimes, they’re supposed to be prosecuted and punished.Except we have this mutant species of corporation called too-big-to-fail banks whose collapse might wreck the global economy. No financial institution in the U.S. can survive a felony indictment. So these companies have become un-indictable, creating a perverse nonchalance regarding financial crimes. In 2010, Wachovia paid $160 million to settle criminal allegations of laundering Mexican drug money. By then the bank had been bought by Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC), and the Justice Department let it off with a deferred-prosecution deal. Usually the most that happens to management is someone resigns, as HSBC’s head of compliance, David Bagley, said he would at last month’s Senate hearing.What would it take for the government to really crack down on wrongdoing in the financial-services industry? What finally prompted the feds to do something about cocaine smuggling into South Florida long ago was the epidemic of violence it spawned.A defining moment came in July 1979, when drug traffickers went on a shooting spree in broad daylight at the Dadeland Mall in Kendall, southwest of Miami. This was unprecedented. The gunmen arrived in a delivery van that had been converted into an armored personnel carrier. Two people were killed. Bystanders dove for cover. Cars in the parking lot were riddled with bullets from machine-gun fire.Attacks like that became frequent over the next few years. In 1979 there were 349 murders in South Florida, according to the Justice Department, triple the number of two years earlier. By 1981 murders had climbed to 621. The local police were outgunned, outnumbered, easily corrupted and often stoned. Finally in 1982 President Ronald Reagan formed a task force and devoted hundreds of additional federal agents to South Florida to restore law and order.Cash SurplusBack then, too, the cartels’ enablers included dirty banks. As Corben’s film noted, in 1979 the Federal Reserve’s Miami branch reported a $5 billion cash surplus -- more than the country’s other Federal Reserve banks combined. One crucial difference, compared with today, was the drug banks in those days were relatively small. When an outfit such as Sunshine State Bank got busted, it didn’t threaten the economy.In terms of stray bullets, Miami is a much safer place today. But mainly what the U.S. did was drive the cartels, the turf battles and the killings into Mexico, where the violence is out of mind for most Americans even while much of that country has turned into a narco-state.Maybe if the bankers were the ones spraying machine-gun fire in the streets, that might spur the U.S. government to take meaningful, punitive action. Short of that, you have to wonder if anything would. Too-big-to-fail isn’t merely an economic problem. It is a great moral failing of our society that poisons our democracy.

The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits rose by 34,000 last week, a figure that may have been skewed higher by seasonal factors. Applications for benefits increased to a seasonally adjusted 386,000, the Labor Department said Thursday, July 19, 2012. The gain followed a drop of 24,000 the previous week and was the biggest jump since April 2011. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2ccca200000300000094e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We all know that the key to our economic future is a more educated workforce, right? Here, for example, are the ""Guiding Principles"" of President Obama's education policies: Providing a high-quality education for all children is critical to America's economic future. Our nation's economic competitiveness and the path to the American Dream depend on providing every child with an education that will enable them to succeed in a global economy that is predicated on knowledge and innovation.Now it's certainly true that a good education is still the best ticket -- other than inheriting wealth -- to entering the middle class. In the simplest terms, Americans with a Bachelor's degree or more earn more than the average wage and those with an Associate's degree earn less. So it makes sense for us to encourage our children to get a good education. But is the president's assertion that the path to the American Dream in the new global economy depends on providing every child with a good education true?As an important new report underscores, if that is the only path we rely on, our economy will come up way short and so will the great majority of Americans who are striving to live the American Dream -- with and without a good education. In Where Have All the Good Jobs Gone?, Center for Economic and Policy Research economists John Schmitt and Janelle Jones make a simple and powerful point: Over the past three decades, the workforce in the United States has gotten a lot more educated and productive, but fewer of us have a good job. The standard that Schmitt and Jones set for a good job is pretty basic: earning the median wage for men of $37,000 a year and having some sort of health insurance and retirement fund at work. Of course, that isn't a lot of money, and with most workers forced to pick up a bigger share of shrinking health benefits and pensions giving way to 401Ks, not a lofty benefit plan. Which is what makes the results of the study so striking. Even though the typical American worker is twice as likely to have a college degree than 30 years ago, the share of the workforce that has a good job declined, from 27.4 percent to 24.6 percent. The kicker here is that the decline occurred at every education level, although it was worse for those with a scanty education. But even workers with a four-year college degree or better were less likely to have a minimally decent job. The CEPR researchers take the data a bit further to make two compelling points. If we had not increased our educational level, it would have been a lot worse: only 17 percent of workers would have good jobs. The second point is that if job quality had kept up with increases in education, then 34 percent of workers would have a good job.I want to throw one more scary statistic into this brew before drawing the implications for building an economy that will work for everyone: most of the jobs that will be created in the next decade don't require much of an education. Of the 10 occupations expected to create the most jobs, eight of them require a high school degree or less. There will be almost four million job openings for retail clerks, home health aides, and the like compared with one million for nurses and college professors, the only two jobs in the 10 that require more than a high school degree.These numbers foretell an economy where even workers with a good education are barely making it and most Americans don't have a prayer of living the American Dream.The guiding principle for a different economic path is making the middle class the engine of the economy. Our economic policy must be driven by a commitment to make every job a middle-class job, regardless of the educational level of the worker. That means sharing our economic progress broadly, not concentrating it among a shrinking sliver of the rich.As the authors of Where Have All the Good Jobs Gone? point out in the first paragraph of their report, we have gotten a lot richer as a nation -- 60 percent richer -- over the 30 years in which good jobs dissolved. A more educated workforce, and an increase of about 50 percent in physical capital growth, led to a big jump in productivity. If that growth in productivity had been shared fairly, that $37,000 median wage would be a lot higher: $68,000 by one calculation. Even by a more modest measure -- if inequality had not increased, median family income would be $9,000 more. By either calculation, if that extra income were in the pockets of Americans -- instead of sitting in the investment portfolios of the super-rich and big corporations -- the economy would be booming.There are a host of policy solutions to build an economy in which our growth is broadly shared. A huge step would be to increase unionization. The manufacturing and construction workers of the mid-20th century didn't have a high school education -- they had a union. We should boost pay for low-income workers by increasing the minimum wage and enforcing wage laws so that employers pay workers for overtime and meal breaks and don't steal their wages or pretend they are independent contractors. We need to use public dollars to invest in job creation, from construction workers to school teachers, all with good wages and benefits. And yes, we should make it possible for many more of our young people to get a good and affordable education. But whether they get that education or not, all workers should get enough to live a dignified, secure life so they can take that path to the American Dream. Cross-posted from Next New Deal."

A spokeswoman at the U.S. Department of Justice did not return phone calls or emails seeking comment.Libor, the London interbank offered rate, is used to set rates on trillions of dollars of contracts for everything from home mortgages to credit cards. The investigation has embroiled banks on both sides of the Atlantic and involves yen and euro rates as well as those for the dollar.Lawyers familiar with the investigation say federal prosecutors continue to reach out to individuals to gauge interest in cooperating or taking pleas. They said p r osecutors are expected to begin making decisions on charging individuals late this month or in early September.Indeed, many of the traders under scrutiny do not believe they did anything wrong because their employers and regulators had some awareness of their activities, the lawyers said. Information released by the New York Fed shows that bank regulators in the United States and Europe knew some banks were submitting low Libor bids during the financial crisis to make institutions appear healthier than they were.A person familiar with Reich's dismissal from Barclays said that the young trader, who joined Barclays just two years after graduating from Princeton University, was directed by his supervisors to send the emails and they were aware of everything he was doing.The person, who did not want to be identified, said the practice of sending emails to gather information on future Libor pricing went back to the 1990s at Barclays, long before Reich joined the firm.""This was systemic at Barclays,"" said the person.Barclays declined to comment. INCONSPICUOUSReich was a part of a low-profile New York trading desk at Barclays that is now increasingly in focus as prosecutors and regulators extend their investigation of the Libor scandal, which began to come to light in 2008. In June, Barclays paid a $453 million penalty to authorities in t he United States and the UK to settle allegations some of its traders colluded with people at other banks to manipulate Libor.In the United States, federal authorities and regulators are focusing on the activities of the Barclays desk on which Reich worked. It traded U.S. Treasury and U.S. dollar and Canadian dollar interest rate swaps.Reuters previously reported that Jay Merchant, one of that desk's top traders, who in 2009 served as head of U.S. dollar swaps trading, is being scrutinized by federal authorities as well. Merchant moved to UBS in late 2009 to run that firm's swaps desk.Ritankar ""Ronti"" Pal, who Merchant reported to and who had overseen all of the desk's trading since 2006, recently left Barclays, according to people familiar with the matter. A man who appeared at an address listed for Pal declined comment and called for building security to escort a reporter away. Pal didn't respond to a written request for comment.The Libor investigation is focusing on allegations that traders at various banks colluded to try and rig the price of Libor to impact the interest rate on swaps, a type of derivative contract. On many swaps, the interest paid is a floating rate, so depending on which side a bank sat on a trade it would have an interest in getting either a lower or higher Libor rate.One thing authorities are looking into is whether traders at banks were trying to get information ahead of time to know where Libor was going to be set for the next day, or work with other traders to influence the rate.As reported last week by Reuters, people familiar with the investigation said authorities are looking at whether some individuals on the Barclay's trading desk tried to influence the rate on Libor by communicating with other traders in London to get a higher return on certain swaps the desk was trading.Traders at JPMorgan Chase & Co also had dealings with some of the Barclays traders under scrutiny, according to a person familiar with the investigation. JPMorgan declined to comment.Reich filed an employment arbitration case against Barclays following his dismissal. The case was eventually resolved, though terms were not disclosed. POSSIBLE CHARGESAnother lawyer familiar with the investigation said prosecutors could charge traders with wire fraud, a charge that does not require them to actually have succeeded in manipulating Libor, but merely have sought to do it. Wire fraud is often used when individuals communicate through emails or cell phones as part of a conspiracy charge.Reich's current employer, WCG Management, is a macro hedge fund that specializes in trading bonds, currencies and interest rate swaps. It oversees $3.4 billion in assets and is led by Barry Wittlin, a former top proprietary trader with Merrill Lynch.Officials at WCG did not respond to a request for comment.People familiar with the investigation said there is no indication authorities are looking at the hedge fund and authorities are not looking at any of Reich's activities at the fund.

I'm jealous of me then,"" he tells his friend Martino Sclavi as he watches the homemade video at the London’s Savoy Hotel. ""It doesn't make a difference to me. The money, the fame, the power, the sex, the women - none of it. I'd rather be a drug addict.""In April, the comedian and actor testified before a parliamentary committee reviewing U.K. drug policy to call for more ""compassionate"" action toward drug addicts. ""By regarding addiction as an illness, by offering treatment instead of a more punitive approach, we can prevent people from committing crimes,"" Brand told members of Parliament, before opening up about his own struggles with heroin addiction. ""Personally, I was a criminal when I was a drug addict by virtue of my addiction and the ways that I had to acquire money to get drugs."" According to The Guardian, Brand testified to advocate for treating drug addiction as a health and social welfare issue rather than as a criminal one. Despite cracking a few jokes, Brand was serious in his plea. ""I think there needs to be love and compassion for everybody involved,"" said Brand. ""If people are committing criminal behavior, then it needs to be dealt with legally, but you need to offer them treatment.""Brand has been open about his battle to overcome drug addiction in the past and has said society needs to change the way it views addicts. After the death of singer Amy Winehouse in July, Brand wrote a passionate blog post on his website to not only honor his late friend but also to advocate for treatment, claiming that drug addiction should be treated like a potentially fatal illness.""Addiction is a serious disease; it will end with jail, mental institutions or death,"" he wrote. ""All we can do is adapt the way we view [addiction], not as a crime or a romantic affectation but as a disease that will kill.""Brand, who has been sober for nearly a decade, attends AA meetings three times a week in order to keep his addiction in check. ""To me, the gravity is heroin, and then death. You know, to sleep,"" he told Details magazine last May, ""that incremental suicide of turning your life into a dream, to make being awake as similar to sleep as possible. Drowsily, lazily, dry-mouth your way through the day's ceremonies, fumble your way back into the dew-bather you never really left, draped in brown, brown now all around, the haze!""PHOTOS: Celebrity rehab stories"
9,ENTERTAINMENT,Marilyn Monroe's Career: What Would Have Happened If She Hadn't Died 50 Years Ago At 36?,Joe Satran,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marilyn-monroe-career_us_5bb3fbaae4b066f8d252ca9d,"Churchwell added that Monroe was plagued by debilitating stage fright, even on movie sets, so she would have had to address",2012-08-04,"In this undated publicity photo courtesy Running Press, Marilyn Monroe is shown wearing a knife-pleated gold lamé gown made from one complete circle of fabric. She wore this dress in ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes."" Monroe passed away a half-century ago this week, a murky death that remains one of Hollywood's most tantalizing mysteries. But look around: Her legend lives on, more vibrantly than ever. In a twist she surely would have appreciated, this 1950's bombshell has become a 21st-century pop culture phenom. (AP Photo/Courtesy Running Press)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3fbaa200000e5000051c1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Fifty years ago this Sunday, Paula Strasberg was sitting in her apartment on Central Park West when she got a horrible phone call. Her friend and pupil Marilyn Monroe was dead.Strasberg had been with Monroe just days before in Los Angeles, coaching her through her performance on what ended up being her final movie, ""Something's Gotta Give."" The coaching taxed Strasberg's strength, which was already ravaged by cancer that she refused to discuss with even close friends and that ended her life soon after, so she flew back to New York for a few days of rest. She knew Marilyn wasn't doing well -- but she had no idea just how badly.Strasberg's son John, one of the few people alive who knew Monroe well, recalls that his mother was wracked by guilt in the days that followed the awful revelation.""My mother was going, 'Oh, it's my fault, I should have been there with her'. One had the sense of taking care of Marilyn. She liked that -- and she also elicited it from people,"" he told The Huffington Post. Paula was, of course, far from alone in her grief. Monroe's death from a drug overdose at the age of 36 was a personal tragedy -- the inevitable ending to a life that was wracked by depression, abuse and drug addiction. But it was an equally large tragedy for Hollywood. The movie industry lost years, if not decades, of work from one of its brightest stars. Monroe was so tortured the last few years of life that she was in no shape to get her career together. Even if she had survived the night of Aug. 5, 1962, she might have ended up in a similar situation a few months later. And many of the factors that led her to abuse drugs were tied to her personal life, not her career. But assuming for a moment that she was able to find health and happiness -- what might have she done for the next 30 or 40 years of her career?It's a question that has haunted John Strasberg, 71, for a half a century. He knew Monroe for about eight years, when he was a teenager and she worked with his parents, Paula and Lee Strasberg, who ran the famed Actors Studio in New York. The Strasbergs played as big a part as anyone in Monroe's career during its final phase.Monroe went to the Strasbergs in search of respect. She was tired of being known as nothing more than a pretty face, and eager to be taken seriously as an actress. John Strasberg said his father would talk to Monroe for hours and hours, alone in their apartment. Despite Paula's best efforts to eavesdrop on their conversations, no one ever knew what they discussed. But John Strasberg said that those talks and Monroe's work at the Actors Studio convinced his father that she had it in her to become the kind of dramatic actress she hoped to be. ""My father, who adored her and thought she was potentially one of the great actresses of her generation, thought that she could play all the great parts -- Blanche, in '[A] Streetcar [Named Desire],' for example,"" he said. Making better movies was certainly a central ambition in the last years of her life. She was emboldened by her work with the Strasbergs and by the good reviews she got for her roles in ""Bus Stop"" and ""Some Like It Hot."" Monroe and Lee Strasberg talked for years about collaborating on an adaptation of Somerset Maugham's ""Rain,"" which would be directed by Strasberg and star Monroe as protagonist Sadie Thompson. They also discussed adapting Dostoevsky's ""The Brothers Karamazov,"" with Monroe as Grushenka, a beautiful woman who inspires a character to murder his father. There also were rumors of a movie about Freud.Yet Sarah Churchwell, author of 2004's ""The Many Lives Of Marilyn Monroe,"" noted that Monroe's movie choices were severely limited by her contract with 20th Century Fox studios, headed by the dictatorial Darryl Zanuck.""He was completely contemptuous of her,"" she explained. ""People forget how much power the studio heads had in those days. He was giving her garbage all the time because he thought she was worthless.""It's also unclear whether Monroe had the skills to master the kinds of dramatic roles she yearned for. John Strasberg, an actor and acting teacher himself, thinks Monroe was an indisputably ""brilliant comedian,"" who created the ""dumb blonde"" archetype and played it better than anyone else. But he also said she relied too much on his mother's coaching when she tried to stretch beyond that. He thinks that in the best-case scenario, Monroe would have spent the rest of her career pursuing romantic comedies like ""Some Like It Hot"" -- and avoiding both dramas and bad comedies like ""Something's Gotta Give."" But it seems likely that Monroe's movie career would have lasted only a few more years, even in the best of circumstances.""Back in those days, women, after a certain age, just weren't cast in movies,"" Strasberg said. ""Bette Davis was the first one to fight through the prejudice about how women should look in movies and playing leading roles; she had won Academy Awards, but she couldn't get a job, so she put out ads in 'Variety' and the such. Whether Marilyn could have done that, I don't know. Certainly there was the possibility of that.""Churchwell also noted that Monroe died just before Hollywood started to shift away from the studio system and toward the wild culture of the 1970s, which was hard on many actors of Monroe's generation.""I'm struggling to come up with one contemporary of Marilyn's who made any movie in the 70s. There wouldn't have been those roles for her -- she would have had to go do something else,"" she said. ""It's very difficult to imagine her suddenly making films with Warren Beatty.""Monroe might have elected to try acting on the stage in New York. Much of her training at the Actors Studio was geared toward theater, and Strasberg said Monroe always felt more comfortable in the bustling, relatively anonymous world of New York than celebrity-obsessed Los Angeles. Joyce Carol Oates, who in 2001 wrote ""Blonde,"" an novel about Monroe, believes the stage offered Monroe's best chance of salvation. ""My belief about Marilyn Monroe is that if she had only resisted returning to Hollywood, to make such an egregious movie as 'Let's Make Love,' but had remained in NYC in association with the Actors Studio, she might well have had a stage career as a serious mature actress; she might even be alive today,"" Oates wrote in an email to The Huffington Post. Strasberg once performed a scene from ""A Streetcar Named Desire"" with Monroe and found her very charismatic. But he isn't sure Monroe would have been able to sustain a nightly job in theater. ""Could she have held herself together on that daily basis? Would she have had that kind of discipline -- which obviously would have come from having enough love for what she was doing … I just don't know, because I never saw her do it,"" he said.Churchwell added that Monroe was plagued by debilitating stage fright, even on movie sets, so she would have had to address that with a qualified therapist before tackling the theater in a serious way. If Monroe had been able to do that, Churchwell noted, she might have also started a one-woman act in Las Vegas, as her contemporary Debbie Reynolds did. Then again, Monroe also might have decided to leave acting altogether. In her last interview, she said, ""It might be a kind of relief to be finished.""Churchwell pointed out that Monroe was not, in 1962, in a financial position to retire -- the actress had been ""vastly underpaid by contemporary standards of her peers"" for most of her career. (Especially unjust considering how much money others make from her image to this day.) It was only in her last contract with Fox, signed less than a month before her death, that she received $500,000 per movie. And if she had survived the night of Aug. 5, finished ""Something's Gotta Give,"" then made enough movies to build a good-sized nest egg -- what then?""She had seen women like Betty Grable bow out gracefully, say, 'I've had my time, and now it's time for something else',"" Churchwell said. ""So I don't think it was difficult for Marilyn to imagine that.""If she had lived, Monroe would have been 86 this year."

Weinstein will hold a $35,000-per-person dinner at his Westport, Conn. home on Monday, Aug. 6. The famed movie producer has been a staunch supporter of the president. According to public records, Weinstein has donated over $75,000 to democratic campaigns this election cycle, including a $35,800 check directly to Obama's campaign. ""I think he’s got deep personal beliefs,"" Weinstein told The Huffington Post in July. ""I don’t have to agree with everything a candidate does to support him."" In May, actor George Clooney hosted a star-studded Obama fundraiser at his home in Studio City, Ca. The 150-person event brought in $15 million, from both ticket prices -- $40,000 per person -- and donations of $3 or more that entered donors into a raffle to win tickets to the event, according to the Los Angeles Times. Following Clooney's event, actress Sarah Jessica Parker and her husband Matthew Broderick hosted their own dinner for President Obama and his wife Michelle Obama in New York City. The intimate gathering banked approximately $2 million for the president's campaign. Mitt Romney's campaign has criticized President Obama for his relationship with the Hollywood elite. However, when asked about Obama's relationship with the stars in June, his spokesman, Jay Carney, fired back: ""Two words. Donald Trump. Next question?"" Trump is one of Romney's most high-profile supporters."

Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/you-may-be-divorced-but-y_us_5b9c0617e4b03a1dcc7bd805,One of the most misguided concepts divorced couples with children have is that they will actually be able to get divorced.,2012-08-03,"Man and woman quarrelling about little, confused girl. White background, whole body of little girl",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c06171f000051002110cc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the most misguided concepts divorced couples with children have is that they will actually be able to get divorced. Even after the legal dissolution and remarriage, ex-spouses who have children together will always be those children's parents. Parenting decisions have to be made, schools and extracurriculars have to be chosen, homework has to be monitored and transferred between houses.Co-parenting is dramatically altered through parental alienation, mental illness, or abuse. But most exes don't have divorces this extreme. And while they may hate each other, and be bitter about the circumstances of the break-up or the way the settlement went down, they still comprise a family for their children -- albeit, a family that is reconfigured.While it may be unthinkable early on that contentious co-parents could both attend a child's graduation, wedding, or participate as involved grandparents, doing those things becomes likelier as years pass.Which is why working through anger, honoring the terms of the divorce agreement and creating consistency in both households is crucial for the well-being of the children. What's Possible When Children Come First  An example: a man I know was devastated to learn that his wife of 20 years was leaving him for another man. She wanted to move from Los Angeles to Boston -- with their twin daughters -- where she had family, better job opportunities and the man she had fallen in love with. Guess what the husband did? He moved back to Boston as well, where he also had family, got a job, and a home close to his ex and daughters. They now have an amicable divorce and an enviable co-parenting relationship.I realize some readers may be apoplectic at this point. I am not advocating that exes pull up stakes and relocate for the sake of an ex-spouse who strayed. Clearly, this is an unusual situation and one that was only possible because the ex-husband had a job and extended family waiting for him back east. But I mention this case because it is a remarkable example of what's possible when divorced parents shelve their anger and put their children first.Exes must realize that their actions towards the other parent impact that parent's household. If you are consumed with resentment toward your ex, it is imperative that you work through your feelings in therapy rather than take them out on your former partner. If you make life hell for your ex, you also make life hell for your children.Following are two common ways exes get back at their children's other parent. For the sake of clarity, I have made these examples gender-specific, but they can be employed by both men and women.Trying to Control What Goes on in the Other Parent's HouseMothers often have difficulty entrusting their ex-husbands with the care of the children. Sometimes this is because they have been stay-at-home-moms who shouldered the bulk of child-rearing. Sometimes this is because they feel that they are more in tune with their children's needs. Sometimes they feel superior for other reasons.The conviction that mother knows best can lead to intrusive attempts to control what Dad does in his house, like multiple calls to the kids during Dad's timeshare days, interrogating kids about what they did when they were with Dad and frequent e-mails to Dad with copious instructions on the care and feeding of the children.Unless you have good evidence that Dad is endangering the welfare of the children, stay out of his business! Yes, he may do things differently from you, but he would still be doing those things if you were married. It would be great if you could synchronize all aspects of child-rearing -- meals, bedtime, homework supervision, parenting techniques. Rarely is this possible, however. Although you may believe you are helping Dad and protecting the children, compulsive meddling communicates to both that you feel Dad is incompetent.While it's often unconscious, this sense of superiority poisons a co-parenting relationship and hurts the children's relationship with the other parent. Do you really want your kids to grow up thinking Dad is a nincompoop, and you're the only parent they should trust? If the answer to this question is ""yes,"" you need to re-tool your approach to child-rearing.If you don't get a handle on your need to be ""the best"", you will model competitiveness for your children and give them a blueprint for how to blow up future relationships. Another reason to stop sweeping Dad's side of the street: your kids could end up feeling smothered by your intrusiveness and distance themselves from you over time.Withholding Child SupportChild support is designed to help the person with less resources -- generally, but not always the ex-wife -- comfortably provide for the children. In a perfect world of equal pay and equal parenting, there would be no child support: exes would scale down their lifestyles in equal measure, be able to afford two homes, and split all the children's expenses equally.But we don't live in a perfect world. We live in a world in which women typically earn less than men, and, if they have been out of the work force for years due to child-rearing, jobs that pay enough to support a family are not readily available to them. And if an ex-wife is working, she is probably paying a hefty portion of her salary in childcare fees.Some men resent paying child support because they believe their ex-spouses spend the money on expenses that are not child-related. While this is sometimes the case, more often than not the recipient of child support is using that money to feed the kids and keep a roof over their heads. Withholding child support, becoming unemployed in order to modify child support, or simply paying child support late hurts the children. If a mother is stressed out because she doesn't have money to cover rent, the children feel it. Having two homes doesn't mean you're no longer a family. If you are tinkering with child support by telling yourself your kids will have everything they need -- and more -- with you, you are not acting in the best interest of your children. You are acting from a place of revenge against your ex and you need to work through these feelings so that your children grow up feeling safe and able to enjoy their childhood.Stop Competing!Trying to out-parent or undermine your ex are forms of competition. These tactics belong on the sports field or in the business arena, but have no place in family life. Families rife with competition are dysfunctional minefields that wreak havoc on the psyches of their most vulnerable members -- the children. Your number one job as a divorced parent is to support your kids' relationship and home life with your ex. That means paying court-ordered child support on time, respecting your ex's boundaries, and letting your kids know they don't have to take sides. The greatest gift divorced parents can give their children is the sense that they're still a family."

While we were married, I thought he was a real boy. Once he disappeared, I learned otherwise.My husband and I used to watch ""Lost"" and shake our heads in disbelief at Sawyer's deceptions. We laughed at ""Dirty Rotten Scoundrels"" when the con artists were conned themselves. We were shocked at the audacity of Leonardo DiCaprio's character in ""Catch Me if You Can"", and we were disturbed when we discovered the movie was based on a true story. While I thought he shared my disdain for the trickery and fraud in these tales, it seems as though he had been taking notes. Overnight, I went from an ordinary life to one that felt more like a movie.My husband was a brilliant and talented man whose skills included creating and maintaining a separate existence. He had two cameras. Two bicycles. Two wallets. Two wives. Two distinct lives. When the financial mess he created in his life with me became too great to keep hidden, he broke up with me via text and vanished. That was when I learned that my husband was anything but a real boy -- he was a con man. My life was a virtual reality -- my home a movie set consisting of false fronts. He was an expert lie crafter; he always knew the exact proportion of truth to weave into the falsehoods to make a story believable. He always had an answer; he never hesitated. His office must have been like a busy air traffic control tower as he directed emails, texts, and phone calls to support his various tales. The extent of his deceptions was made clear when I sat with an auto insurance card in my hand -- my name had been digitally removed -- while I pulled up the file from the insurance company and verified that both names were present on the actual document. He thought he could erase me as easily as he could my name using Photoshop. While my husband was in jail after being arrested for felony bigamy, I talked with his other wife, who was as stunned by the situation as I was. No woman should ever have to have a conversation about ""our husband,"" even if it is a cordial and informative discussion. I learned that when he was pulled in for questioning, his lies became increasingly absurd as he struggled to maintain his façade. My favorite? He claimed that he and I had divorced years earlier and I had since married a chiropractor named Mark Mercer. Mark, if you're out there, I'm sorry that I have no recollection of our marriage and that I have never recognized our fictitious anniversaries. One of the saddest aspects of the situation is that he was conning himself just as much as he was fooling those around him. In trying to pull the wool over others' eyes, he inadvertently knitted himself a mask with no eyeholes. He told so many lies for so long, he began to believe his own fabrications (he even admitted as much in a text to my mother). It became impossible for him to tell where the lies ended and the authenticity began. In trying to keep everyone else in the dark, he lost himself. The real boy was replaced with a hollow man.  I came out of the marriage confused, unsure of what was real and what was fabrication. I was embarrassed. How could I have been such a fool? My anger was explosive as I came to the realization that I had been literally sleeping with the enemy. The crime was intensified by the fact that it was carried out by the man who had sworn to love and protect me. Yet, eventually, I began to feel compassion for him, as I saw through the lies to the pain that must have born them. I have come to the realization that the life I knew was real to me, and that has to be enough. I will never know what prompted his moral malignancies nor will I ever find certainty in truth. I was conned, but that is not the end of my story. I am now exploring the world un-shaded by his lies."

Fern Mallis with Michelle Obama at the White House wearing Indian designer Kallol Datta (Photo from Fern Mallis' Twitter profile)What did you think of the Gen Next show?The Gen Next show is really the signature of Lakme Fashion Week and it's one of the best things about this week -- discovering and finding new talent. The show was great. Richa Agarwal was my favorite designer in the show. The collection was refreshing, completely saleable and wearable. It was certainly overly layered for the show -- which we all understand, but I could see it next season in Anthropologie or Free People. It was young and exciting, I loved the mix of fabrics, I loved the shapes of the clothes. I thought it was terrific. What is Lakme Fashion Week's greatest strength?I think its biggest strength is discovering new talent and trying to give them that platform. We've seen so much of the talent through the ten years go on to be very successful and then to be players in the industry. When Lakme was formed it was really the split between Delhi and Mumbai and it was a choice that people had to make -- if they wanted to go with the 'newer, younger' or the old guard of Indian fashion and the old guard stayed in Delhi and the new guard came to Lakme.There is a lot of criticism about sponsorship and Bollywood showstoppers and sponsorship at Lakme. What do you think about these criticisms?Through the years there's been a line in the sand that gets stepped over a lot in this country and I, as much as anyone else, understand the need for sponsorships for shows to happen, but for 20 years in New York I was the policeman holding the ground -- where things were inappropriate and where sponsors names and products should not be incorporated into a show for the purity of a show. We lose that battle a lot here in India. That's the shift that's happened through the years and in fashion weeks in general -- it's become a lot more about sponsorships than designers, in some cases. I've always tried to protect the designer's integrity in the shows.Gen Next has been great for some designers while others fall by the wayside. Some designers who gain critical success can't translate that into commercial success. Why do you think this happens?It's a confluence of planets and everything has to come together at the right time, there's no real formula. So much of success in this business is timing, it's luck, it's about financing. One of the biggest obstacles in this country with the designers, if you look at the program and who to contact, the designer has their name, their email -- and that's a problem. There's not enough of a business community here that is training people to be the business partners, to work with these designers and help them grow their businesses and nurture them and finance them. There's not a successful designer in the world who hasn't had a good business partner with them. Here they're all one man, one woman shops. You got to the stalls [in The Source] and maybe mum is there helping write the order. I've written thousands of orders over my ten years here and I can tell you that thousands of things never got delivered or never got made. You never know who's going to follow through, they write it down and you never hear from somebody again. There's a professional code of how to do business that's not being taught here in the schools, and the industry is still very nascent here. So much of your work has been in New York. When people find out that you've done so much in Indian fashion, especially in Bombay, what's their reaction?They're just completely gaga and want to come with me! Everybody I know wants to be in India with me. India is enjoying such an extraordinary place in culture right now, it's India's moment and India really needs to seize that moment and get behind these kinds of industries, the creative talents, the accessories, the designers. I could be bringing a busload -- a plane load! -- of people in a nanosecond who want to be here with me and shop with me. Forty percent of my wardrobe is from India! I'm the big ambassador for India. Kallol Datta, who's closing the show, is thrilled -- I sent him a picture a couple weeks ago of me at the White House with Mrs. Obama wearing his outfit. He's just behind himself and I am so proud to do that because I really think that some of these people are really talented and whatever it takes. Everybody is so intrigued -- if people haven't been here they're dying to come. The people who have been here love India and everyone wants to come back. It's a very special place, you either love it or hate it. There's no gray matter. For me it's a place that I fell in love with 11 years ago and that's been very much a part of my life.

The show was great. Richa Agarwal was my favorite designer in the show. The collection was refreshing, completely saleable and wearable. It was certainly overly layered for the show -- which we all understand, but I could see it next season in Anthropologie or Free People. It was young and exciting, I loved the mix of fabrics, I loved the shapes of the clothes. I thought it was terrific. What is Lakme Fashion Week's greatest strength?I think its biggest strength is discovering new talent and trying to give them that platform. We've seen so much of the talent through the ten years go on to be very successful and then to be players in the industry. When Lakme was formed it was really the split between Delhi and Mumbai and it was a choice that people had to make -- if they wanted to go with the 'newer, younger' or the old guard of Indian fashion and the old guard stayed in Delhi and the new guard came to Lakme.There is a lot of criticism about sponsorship and Bollywood showstoppers and sponsorship at Lakme. What do you think about these criticisms?Through the years there's been a line in the sand that gets stepped over a lot in this country and I, as much as anyone else, understand the need for sponsorships for shows to happen, but for 20 years in New York I was the policeman holding the ground -- where things were inappropriate and where sponsors names and products should not be incorporated into a show for the purity of a show. We lose that battle a lot here in India. That's the shift that's happened through the years and in fashion weeks in general -- it's become a lot more about sponsorships than designers, in some cases. I've always tried to protect the designer's integrity in the shows.Gen Next has been great for some designers while others fall by the wayside. Some designers who gain critical success can't translate that into commercial success. Why do you think this happens?It's a confluence of planets and everything has to come together at the right time, there's no real formula. So much of success in this business is timing, it's luck, it's about financing. One of the biggest obstacles in this country with the designers, if you look at the program and who to contact, the designer has their name, their email -- and that's a problem. There's not enough of a business community here that is training people to be the business partners, to work with these designers and help them grow their businesses and nurture them and finance them. There's not a successful designer in the world who hasn't had a good business partner with them. Here they're all one man, one woman shops. You got to the stalls [in The Source] and maybe mum is there helping write the order. I've written thousands of orders over my ten years here and I can tell you that thousands of things never got delivered or never got made. You never know who's going to follow through, they write it down and you never hear from somebody again. There's a professional code of how to do business that's not being taught here in the schools, and the industry is still very nascent here. So much of your work has been in New York. When people find out that you've done so much in Indian fashion, especially in Bombay, what's their reaction?They're just completely gaga and want to come with me! Everybody I know wants to be in India with me. India is enjoying such an extraordinary place in culture right now, it's India's moment and India really needs to seize that moment and get behind these kinds of industries, the creative talents, the accessories, the designers. I could be bringing a busload -- a plane load! -- of people in a nanosecond who want to be here with me and shop with me. Forty percent of my wardrobe is from India! I'm the big ambassador for India. Kallol Datta, who's closing the show, is thrilled -- I sent him a picture a couple weeks ago of me at the White House with Mrs. Obama wearing his outfit. He's just behind himself and I am so proud to do that because I really think that some of these people are really talented and whatever it takes. Everybody is so intrigued -- if people haven't been here they're dying to come. The people who have been here love India and everyone wants to come back. It's a very special place, you either love it or hate it. There's no gray matter. For me it's a place that I fell in love with 11 years ago and that's been very much a part of my life.
