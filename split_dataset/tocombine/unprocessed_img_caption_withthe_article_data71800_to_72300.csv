(Photo by Mireya Acierto/FilmMagic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb333ac250000320038a96d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As marketing campaigns have transformed Christmas from a celebration of selfless giving and cherished family bonding into a festive economic stimulus day, the 89th installment of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade serves as the quintessential embodiment of American consumerism culture.Another year of this grandiose event has come and passed, as the latest annual celebration marks the continuation of a troublesome trend.Animated balloon characters resembling popular cartoon and action figures, decorative floats, exuberant performers, hype celebrity appearances and frequent product placements personify the yearly Macy's holiday celebration as corporate sponsors have hijacked a parade of holiday spirits and transformed it into a three-hour interpersonal and interactive billboard.This showcase of eclectic and decorative elements concurrently galavanting through the streets of New York is the perfect product and brand display to showcase to the millions of Americans who suffer from chronic impulse purchasing.Thanksgiving immediately precedes the notorious Black Friday, as we switch from a holiday that grants America a socially permissible mulligan on gluttony, to the Hunger Games of bargain hunting and speed shopping.The extravagance of the Macy's Parade is a perfect pivot from a tryptophan-induced coma caused by binge eating, to an epidemic of binge shopping characterized by a seething, insatiable appetite to pummel our peers in a ferocious mall fight for limited discount items -- all for the sake of gift-giving Christmas generosity.Macy's Thanksgiving Parade is an ingenious and sinister technique that simultaneously subtly and overtly advertise products immediately preceding the holiday shopping sprees that swarm American malls.Rather than initiate passive, impersonal television advertisements, companies inflate oversized figures to tug at the heartstrings of innocent children in order to balloon their profits. America's youth are suckered into demanding their parents buy them their favorite action figure or see the movie that these characters impeccably resemble.It's the perfect way to lure the festive joy of Americans to participate in an event that kick starts an avaricious culture that sucks the soul out of Christmas by turning the holiday spirit into holiday shopping lists.The glitz and glamor of this three-hour pomp pageant is a devious plot to divert the average consumer from the cold reality of the Parade's embodiment of the invasive materialism that persistently plagues Christmas season.Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade isn't a festive event; it's a prolonged commercial that manipulates families into buying products they don't need. These corporate executives might as well dress as Santa, force themselves down people's chimneys and dangle Christmas presents from a fishing rod right in front of America's children.But a whopping 50 million Americans watch and partake in an event that embodies the vanity and covetous aspects of American culture despite a strong national sentiment that criticizes the materialization of Christmas.This mindless, nationwide indulge to seasonal consumerism, ignited by the iridescent glamor of contrived entertainment, places greater emphasis on completing people's wish lists rather than using the time to appreciate the unique and special presence of friends and family.This parade has taken everything beautiful about the holiday season and re-packaged it as an onslaught of toys, movies, cars, apparel and household products that are as lifeless as the forced, choreographed movements of the floats, balloons and dancers that comprise the Macy's Thanksgiving Parade.It's time Americans really see this event for what it really is, snap out of the shopping spirit and focus on the real values of Thanksgiving and Christmas."

8,CRIME,Don't Discount Mental Illness in the Case of Abigail Hanna,"Dr. Peggy Drexler, ContributorAuthor, research psychologist and gender scholar",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mental-illness--no-motive-required_b_8655140.html,"The case of Abigail Hanna--the pretty, blonde 21-year-old who allegedly kidnapped a toddler she once cared for--has the media fascinated. How can someone like her become, as the Daily Beast calls her, ""the babysitter from hell""?",2015-11-26,"Abigail Hanna stands during her arraignment Monday, Nov. 23, 2015, at Newburyport District Court in Newburyport, Mass. A court psychologist said Hanna, charged with kidnapping a 2-year-old girl found naked and with her head shaved, is hallucinating. A judge held Hanna without bail and sent her for a 21-day competency evaluation. (Dina Rudick/The Boston Globe via AP, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2c6a53c00005b000af804.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The case of Abigail Hanna--the pretty, blonde 21-year-old who allegedly kidnapped a toddler she once cared for before shaving her head, burning her with cigarettes, and leaving her by the side of the road some eight miles from her home--has the media fascinated, and it's easy to understand why: It's a dramatic, made-for-TV sort of case featuring a small child who endured horrific torture allegedly at the hands of someone who had once been charged with keeping her safe. That Hanna was a bright, beautiful--and, it must be said, white--college student seems to have amplified the appeal and turned the story into international news, with everyone asking, in one way or another, how someone with so much potential can commit such a heinous crime. How can someone like her become, as the Daily Beast calls her, ""the babysitter from hell""? Except criminals come in all shapes, sizes, colors, and backgrounds. So, of course, do the mentally ill. Indeed, it appears that Hanna--who was arrested on multiple charges, including kidnapping, assault and battery on a child, and breaking and entering at night--may suffer from severe mental illness. Earlier this week, when she appeared in court for her arraignment, she could not stand without assistance and appeared vacant-eyed. A court clinician who had examined her testified that Hanna ""was unable to present a factual understanding of the charges or even understanding of where she was that was completely logical."" Hanna also expressed suicidal ideation and was experiencing ""multiple psychotic symptoms including auditory hallucinations.""According to the National Alliance on Mental Illness, 61.5 million Americans suffer from mental illness in any given year, while the CDC reports that just over a third of people with severe depression had been to see a mental health professional within the previous year. Mental illness is highly common and exceedingly undertreated. And yet in searching for Hanna's motive--some explanation for why the blond, blue-eyed girl with so much going for her would do such a thing--the media seems to have underestimated the power of mental illness. At the very least, there seems to be an insistence on fixating on the qualities that seem to make Hanna's crime--and, perhaps, her mental illness--so unbelievable, posting photo after photo of the young woman in happier times. As the Daily Beast writes, ""it's unclear why Hanna, a newly engaged former camp counselor, would snatch and abuse her former client."" Her Facebook photos, after all, show her ""beaming with friends, picking apples, and stirring coffee.""As if mentally ill people don't pick apples.Here's the thing about mental illness, the thing we too often forget when looking for answers to the why and the how: Mental illness acts without prejudice and motive. And, very often, it acts without fair warning. It can be maddening to try to figure out why a person suffering from mental illness acts as she does, and there can often be no answers. While there can be a trigger to a psychotic break, that's not always the case. While a mentally ill person committing a crime can have motive to do so, that's also not always the case. The fact is that there's so much, too much, we don't understand about mental illness.Some reports note that Hanna suffered a miscarriage not long ago. Another headline introduces the idea that she was an avid pot smoker, as if that explains anything. She was, reports say, a frequent shoplifter.Hanna was also, reportedly, recently engaged, and the question has been implied: How could someone ""normal"" enough to have a fiancé commit such a horrific crime? Didn't he--didn't anyone--see this coming? He may have; we haven't heard from him. But holding anyone else but Hanna accountable is to ignore the very quality that can make mental illness so tragic: its unpredictably. What's more, to wonder how Hanna could have had a fiancé is to imply that mentally ill people can't be loved. They can, and they are.This isn't to say Hanna should not be held accountable for her actions. If she is ill, she deserves help, and, if she was aware she needed help, it's truly a tragedy that she didn't seek it earlier. But it's a disservice to those suffering from mental illness to continue looking at these cases as if they are explainable; as if there must be reason for every action. For many people who suffer from mental illness, there is no explanation or cause or sense.As one criminologist examining Hanna's case put it, ""This is a crime that is totally nonsensical."" The same could be said about mental illness in general. The problem is that we don't say it nearly enough."
9,POLITICS,Governors Could Restore Voting Rights To Millions Of People If They Wanted To,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/felon-voting-rights-restoration_us_5655de80e4b079b28189da1e,More people with past felony convictions will soon get to vote in Kentucky. But Iowans and Floridians still face many hurdles.,2015-11-25,Kentucky Gov. Steve Beshear (D) signed an executive order on Nov. 24 that would automatically restore voting rights to a large number of former felons in the state who have served their sentences.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5655df931700008100e1a8d6.jpeg?ops=crop_0_160_3000_1837%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"There’s a growing bipartisan consensus in Congress that restoring voting rights for people with felony convictions is a crucial aspect of criminal justice reform. But governors have a massive amount of discretion in deciding whether to reinstate voting rights for millions of ex-felons who are still denied the right to vote, as recent decisions in Kentucky and Iowa illustrate.On Tuesday, Kentucky’s outgoing Democratic governor, Steve Beshear, signed an executive order that would automatically restore voting rights to at least 140,000 former felons who have served their sentences. Kentucky is just one of just three states, along with Florida and Iowa, that permanently disenfranchises all people with felony convictions. Up until now, a Kentuckian with a felony conviction would have to individually petition the governor to have his or her rights restored.As in other states, permanent felon disenfranchisement disproportionately affects racial minorities. An estimated 1 in 5 African-Americans in Kentucky are disenfranchised, compared to 1 in 13 nationally.""All of our society will be better off if we actively work to help rehabilitate those who have made a mistake,"" Beshear said. ""And the more we do that, the more the entire society will benefit.""The reprieve could be short-lived, however. Kentucky's incoming governor, Republican Matt Bevin, could sign another executive order that would undo Beshear's mass voting rights restoration. Though Bevin has said in the past that he supports the automatic restoration of voting rights, there’s no telling what intra-party pressure could do. “Governor Beshear’s actions are not permanent,""ACLU Program Director Kate Miller wrote in an email to The Huffington Post. ""Since felon voting rights restrictions are enshrined in the Kentucky Constitution, it will take legislative action to start the process to make these changes permanent law.”Miller added that since Bevin “has been vocal in his support of restoration of voting rights,” the ACLU remains “hopeful he will allow these changes to stand while we work with the General Assembly to reform our out-of-date laws.”Acknowledging that his executive order could be revoked, Beshear said in a press conference that he hoped the state’s legislature would put a constitutional amendment on the ballot so individuals who have served their sentences would have their rights automatically restored in the future.The Democratic-controlled state House has already passed legislation that automatically restores voting rights to some people with felony convictions, but there's been more gridlock in the Republican-controlled state Senate. The GOP leadership there wants to institute a five-year waiting period before ex-felons can apply to have their rights restored, but Democrats have rejected the proposal.The ACLU of Kentucky is urging Kentuckians to act quickly to have their rights restored, “while the opportunity is available.”In recent years, other states have have also restored voting rights to more people with past convictions. Over the past five years, six states -- Delware, New Jersey, Wyoming, Iowa, New York and Virginia -- have enacted reforms to the voting rights restoration process, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. In 2005, Iowa's then-governor, Democrat Tom Vilsack, issued an executive order allowing approximately 80,000 Iowan citizens to vote, ending the state’s permanent disenfranchisement of former felons. But Republican Gov. Terry Branstad reversed this action in 2011. (He has since made the application process to have rights restored slightly less difficult by removing a credit report requirement.)The ACLU of Iowa is challenging the state constitution’s definition of “infamous crimes,” a 19th century standard that still dictates which Iowans can vote when they finish their sentence. Very few people with felony convictions have successfully navigated the onerous process to have their rights restored. The ACLU's lead plaintiff, Kelli Jo Griffin, was nearly prosecuted for perjury after she attempted to vote five years after she served a period of probation for a low-level drug offense. She was unaware that her voting rights had been permanently revoked.The Iowa Supreme Court is likely to hear arguments in the ACLU’s case next year, with a decision possible in June. That would allow people with past felony convictions to register to vote in the 2016 elections.“Whether or not somebody is eligible to vote in our state really shouldn't depend on who the governor is,” said Jeremy Rosen, the executive director of the ACLU of Iowa.In Florida, a coalition of civil rights groups has launched a petition drive to place a constitutional amendment on the ballot in 2016 that would undo the state's permanent disenfranchisement of people with felony convictions. More than 1.6 million Floridians cannot vote -- or about 9 percent of people in the state. Between 1 in 4 and 1 in 5 African-Americans in Florida can’t vote, and 17 percent of the state’s population is black. As in Iowa and Kentucky, gubernatorial discretion plays a huge role in rights restoration. Former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist (R) signed an executive order in 2007 restoring rights to nonviolent offenders who had served their time, but his order was rescinded when the current governor, Republican Rick Scott, took office in 2011. The policy change had ramifications for thousands. In 2009 and 2010, Crist restored voting rights to more than 30,000 people with felony convictions. In 2013 and 2014, after Scott took office, only 911 former felons had their rights restored, according to the Sun-Sentinel. Also on HuffPost:"

""Imagine a world where the holidays were about people again,"" TJX, the parent company of Marshalls and T.J.

Sixteen percent say they'll be hunting for deals on Black Friday, a more traditional shopping day, while 29 percent think they'll shop over the weekend. The remainder either aren't planning to go shopping or haven't decided yet.A significant fraction of those people may be busy at work instead.Twenty-two percent of Americans say that they or someone in their family will be working on Thanksgiving. Those in higher-income households are more likely to have the holiday off: Twenty-eight percent of those in households making less than $40,000 are working or have a relative who is, compared to just 13 percent of those in households that make $80,000 or more.

Researchers confirmed that Gifford had CTE.""We decided to disclose our loved one’s condition to honor Frank’s legacy of promoting player safety dating back to his involvement in the formation of the NFL Players Association in the 1950s,"" the family's statement said. ""His entire adult life Frank was a champion for others, but especially for those without the means or platform to have their voices heard.""The statement continued:During the last years of his life Frank dedicated himself to understanding the recent revelations concerning the connection between repetitive head trauma and its associated cognitive and behavioral symptoms – which he experienced firsthand. We miss him every day, now more than ever, but find comfort in knowing that by disclosing his condition we might contribute positively to the ongoing conversation that needs to be had; that he might be an inspiration for others suffering with this disease that needs to be addressed in the present; and that we might be a small part of the solution to an urgent problem concerning anyone involved with football, at any level.Researchers at Boston University said in September that they have found CTE in 87 of the 91 former NFL players they have studied, though they cautioned that their sample may be slightly skewed from studying players who were already suspected of having the disease.Gifford sat out the entire 1961 season after suffering a hit the year before that left him unconscious on the field."

Trump's numbers, which dipped in October, have largely recovered."" [HuffPost]But scoring within the margin of error doesn't really imply a tie - HuffPollster: ""So maybe this means that Trump and Cruz are kinda, sorta... tied? Not really. 'Within the margin of error' simply means that we can’t be 95 percent certain Trump is genuinely leading Cruz in this poll. Pollsters use the margin of error to describe how much error there might be in a poll estimate due to random sampling. It’s almost always calculated at the 95 percent confidence level. This means that for a poll with a margin of error of 4 percentage points, you could conduct the same poll 100 more times with 100 different random samples and the results would still end up within a 4-point range in 95 of the polls….When two poll estimates fall within the margin of error -- such as Cruz’s 23 percent and Trump’s 25 percent -- all it means is that we’re somewhat less than 95 percent confident that Trump would still lead Cruz if the poll used a different random sample…. In fact, there’s about an 80 percent chance that Trump actually leads Cruz in the Quinnipiac poll. "" [HuffPost]A GOOD RESULT FOR POLLSTERS IN LOUISIANA - Kirby Goidel and Keith Gaddie: ""There were two winners Saturday's Louisiana general runoff. One was state Rep. John Bel Edwards, the unknown Democrat who was elected governor. The other was political polling.....The failure of political polls to capture the late surge to Republican Matt Bevin left most observers wondering whether the polls might be equally flawed in Louisiana. As LSU political scientist Michael Henderson observed, the polls would have to be much further off than the Kentucky polls to miss their mark in Louisiana. In the end, Democrat John Bel Edwards defeated David Vitter by a healthy 12-point margin, not far off the 10-point margin estimated by Huffpost Pollster based on aggregated state poll results. Before we get too self-congratulatory, however, it worth noting that looking at the average misses considerable variation across polls which ranged from a 4-point to 20-point margin.

Instead, Trump Card LLC, a limited liability company, was formed. Could this be the start of a new trend in political spending for the post-Citizens United age?Probably not. The main problem with doing independent election spending through an LLC is that it has the same benefits and downsides as other available options, plus one significant added cost.""The practical difference is an LLC is going to have to pay income tax,"" said Larry Noble, general counsel for the Campaign Legal Center.As a for-profit business, a LLC, or rather its controlling partners, must pay income tax on the money it receives. This means that a certain percentage of every $1 million contribution from a wealthy individual or corporation goes to the Internal Revenue Service, rather than into efforts to aid candidates. On the benefits side, an electorally active LLC, like a political nonprofit, would most likely be able to avoid disclosing its contributors. Donor anonymity appears to be a major reason for the formation of Trump Card as an LLC. ""I certainly know donors who are very happy that their fingerprints will be kept off things,"" Liz Mair, the Republican consultant behind Trump Card, told The Wall Street Journal. She further stated that donors supporting the GOP presidential campaigns of Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas), former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and Ohio Gov. John Kasich are interested in backing the anti-Trump effort, but don't want their names tied to it. An LLC would also -- like a nonprofit -- be required to spend at least 51 percent of its time and money on non-electoral activity. While nonprofits must meet this threshold to maintain their nonprofit status with the IRS, an LLC must have a primary purpose other than election spending to avoid having to register as a political committee with the Federal Election Commission. If the LLC were forced to register as a political committee, it would be required to disclose its donors.Numerous politically minded groups have insisted they don't involve themselves in elections, and thus maintained their nonprofit status, by focusing on funding so-called issue ads, which promote or attack candidates without specifically calling for their election or defeat. An LLC could copy this tactic to help avoid the political committee label.Any resulting complaints filed against a LLC doing election spending would likely be stalled by the FEC's habit of deadlocking over enforcement of these controversial matters.Perhaps the clearest sign that LLCs are not the future of independent election spending: Mair told HuffPost that Trump Card may switch from the LLC structure to another form."
19,SPORTS,Football On Thanksgiving Is Nearly As Old As The Holiday Itself,Juliet Spies-Gans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/football-thanksgiving-history_us_5654acbde4b0879a5b0ca78f,The two were destined to be together from the beginning.,2015-11-25,"Wood engraving from Harper's Weekly magazine depicts on-field action during a football game between Yale and Princeton on Thanksgiving Day, November 1879.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5654dc001b0000270029e8a6.jpeg?cache=jTRcZSe7FF&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Nov. 6, 1869, 25 players from Rutgers University carried scarlet handkerchiefs onto a field in northern New Jersey as a means of distinguishing themselves from the opposing Princeton squad. That matchup marked what is considered today the first football game ever played. Only weeks later, the country's newest sport would be played on one of its newest official holidays: Thanksgiving. And so, the longstanding tradition of football on Turkey Day was born. Football and Thanksgiving have been coupled almost since the birth of each of them. Abraham Lincoln had declared Thanksgiving a national holiday in 1863, just six years prior to the first football game on Thanksgiving, played so soon after the sport's invention. After that inaugural game in 1869, high school and college teams throughout the rest of the century, and throughout the rest of the country, began to purposely schedule games on Thanksgiving, when the day off would bring the greatest number of people to the local fields to support the amateur squads. So when the NFL was founded in 1920, its decision to play ball on that fourth Thursday of November was more reflexive than revelatory. But in 1934, Detroit Lions owner George Richards made a decision that would ensure the old tradition would become a mainstay in American culture from there on out. Not only did Richards have the Lions play on Thanksgiving, but he used his personal connections to the NBC radio network to make the Detroit-Chicago Bears Thanksgiving matchup the first nationally broadcast game in NFL history, thus taking advantage of those Americans off for the holiday with little to do besides cook. According to sports-culture expert and New York University professor David Hollander, since that point, the NFL’s ""marriage"" to Thanksgiving has been near-constant, disregarding a few seasons around World War II.

20,SPORTS,Football On Thanksgiving Is Nearly As Old As The Holiday Itself,Juliet Spies-Gans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/football-thanksgiving-history_us_5654acbde4b0879a5b0ca78f,The two were destined to be together from the beginning.,2015-11-25,"Detroit Lion players Gus Frerotte, Greg Hill, Johnnie Morton and Robert Porcher sample FOX TV's Jon Madden's turkey after their home game against the Chicago Bears on Nov. 25 1999.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5654b0a82100003e005ab8f5.jpeg?cache=2Hk4RMWhf4&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On Nov. 6, 1869, 25 players from Rutgers University carried scarlet handkerchiefs onto a field in northern New Jersey as a means of distinguishing themselves from the opposing Princeton squad. That matchup marked what is considered today the first football game ever played. Only weeks later, the country's newest sport would be played on one of its newest official holidays: Thanksgiving. And so, the longstanding tradition of football on Turkey Day was born. Football and Thanksgiving have been coupled almost since the birth of each of them. Abraham Lincoln had declared Thanksgiving a national holiday in 1863, just six years prior to the first football game on Thanksgiving, played so soon after the sport's invention. After that inaugural game in 1869, high school and college teams throughout the rest of the century, and throughout the rest of the country, began to purposely schedule games on Thanksgiving, when the day off would bring the greatest number of people to the local fields to support the amateur squads. So when the NFL was founded in 1920, its decision to play ball on that fourth Thursday of November was more reflexive than revelatory. But in 1934, Detroit Lions owner George Richards made a decision that would ensure the old tradition would become a mainstay in American culture from there on out. Not only did Richards have the Lions play on Thanksgiving, but he used his personal connections to the NBC radio network to make the Detroit-Chicago Bears Thanksgiving matchup the first nationally broadcast game in NFL history, thus taking advantage of those Americans off for the holiday with little to do besides cook. According to sports-culture expert and New York University professor David Hollander, since that point, the NFL’s ""marriage"" to Thanksgiving has been near-constant, disregarding a few seasons around World War II. In celebration of that 1934 matchup, Detroit still hosts a game on the holiday every season.
