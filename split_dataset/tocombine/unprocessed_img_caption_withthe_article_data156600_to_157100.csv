In the short run, you can also choose beliefs that will leave you feeling better, happier, more peaceful.",2013-04-26,"A pretty blonde woman looks horrified and helpless as her frayed and broken umbrella blows away from her, dragging her along, in a thunderstorm. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d122d250000320036503a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On the way out to the launch party for my first-ever book, I had to stop and clean up cat vomit. There I was during one of my biggest nights of my career, on the ground in my slacks and fancy-schmanzy coral-colored sweater, scrubbing at the once-white carpet. Ever had a moment like that? A moment where you feel like you've finally achieved a once-lofty goal, reached an important mark, or experienced a keen sense of joy, peace, or success, only to have it broken up by a messy moment or disparaging thought? My moment, I can blame on the cat (though I do think we are all ultimately responsible for what we attract into our lives). But all too often, we sabotage our own success in other ways with beliefs that keep us down.You can stop and clean up those beliefs, though -- after all, they are just repetitive thoughts that we've taken as truth, or adopted unconsciously. You can discard those that aren't helpful anymore and rework others so that they propel you toward your greatest dreams. In the short run you can also choose beliefs that will leave you feeling better, happier, more peaceful. You can subscribe to thoughts that will support your success, rather than sabotage it. So, are you ready to shrug off that skin of self-sabotage?Start by identifying the areas where limiting beliefs are at work in your life, then you can clear them out.Three Ways to Uncover Limiting Beliefs1. Look at the areas of your life that aren't working as you'd like. Perhaps your relationship isn't what you want it to be, or you are stuck in a dead-end job. Usually, when we aren't creating what we want in our lives, it's because we believe that we're unworthy or that we can't have all that we desire. Identify what isn't working and start exploring the thought patterns that support that limitation. Once you know what they are you can trade those limiting ideas out for those that are more supportive. 2. Observe the self-talk. Any vague statement, anything that sounds absolute or abstract, disparaging or diminishing in any way is the language of a limiting belief. Listen for words like ""I can't,"" ""I never,"" ""I'm not good enough,"" or ""I'm just unlucky."" Life is about energy flow. Limiting language slows the flow and can show us where bad beliefs are working behind the scenes of our lives. Next time you catch this kind of self-talk, observe it, write it down, recognize what's fueling it and then choose different language when you talk to yourself.3. Follow the energy. Do you feel excited and alive on Saturday when you know you have time to paint, or coach your daughter's soccer team? Are you drained Monday mornings when you head back to work? When do you feel most energized? Fatigued? Follow the energy. The things that fill us up are often those activities that steer us, even without our knowing, toward our passions and values. When we are wiped out, it's due in part to the beliefs we hold about a particular activity or event. Pay attention to the way the energy flows through your body -- when it drops and you feel fatigued, scrutinize the source of the energy lag. Behind it you'll find the belief holding you back.So, what now? Now that you've begun exploring the limiting beliefs at work in your life, you you get rid of them and end the self-sabotage.Start by becoming aware. Notice what you are thinking and when. Once you identify some of those deep-seated beliefs -- the things sticking like superglue to your psyche -- cross-examine them. Where did they come from? Are they helpful or a hindrance? Is there another belief that would empower you more? Go gently, be kind to yourself. We all have beliefs that we've accepted without scrutiny. Some have even helped us survive our experience. This isn't time to beat yourself up, it is simply time to notice.If you decide these beliefs no longer serve you, reframe them into something that does. Write a new sentence that will guide your habits. Then, live your life from that new belief. Choose behaviors that support it. Practice it. Remind yourself of your new beliefs. Post them on your computer and bathroom mirror.And, when you slip up and revert to the old habits -- because you will, because we all do -- notice and smile and start again. It's okay, just continue on.Soon, the new beliefs will take hold and create tangible results in your life that will support your success instead of sabotaging it.Some portions of this post were adapted from Imperfect Spirituality: Extraordinary Enlightenment for Ordinary People  For more by Polly Campbell, click here.For more on success and motivation, click here."

The outbreak was linked to a tainted steroid distributed by the New England Compounding Center.The proposal would draw a distinction between traditional compounding pharmacies, which make drugs based on specific prescriptions for individual patients, and those such as NECC, which make products without prescriptions for physicians to keep for future use.""By clarifying FDA authority over high-risk compounding practices, this bill will enhance protections for patients taking compounded drugs and help prevent crises like last year's tragic meningitis outbreak,"" Iowa Democrat Tom Harkin, chairman of the Senate health committee that developed the draft legislation, said in a statement.The bill would create a new class of drugmaker that would be regulated by the FDA but would be exempt from the full raft of regulations that apply to traditional pharmaceutical companies.For example, these ""compounding manufacturers"" would not be required to submit their products to the FDA for approval before selling them. Nor would they be required to negotiate the labeling of their drugs with the FDA; they would only be required to indicate that the products are compounded and list certain other specified information.These companies would no longer be licensed as pharmacies. They would be required to register with the FDA, and report to the agency any problems reported by patients or physicians. They would also be required to pay an annual fee to defray the cost of FDA inspections.Compounding manufacturers would not be allowed to compound biologic products made from live organisms or other complex drugs. And they would be prohibited from compounding FDA-approved drugs unless they are in short supply.Traditional compounding pharmacies would continue to be licensed and regulated by state boards of pharmacy.A spokeswoman for the FDA, Erica Jefferson, said the agency was reviewing the draft ""and looks forward to continuing to work closely with the committee to address existing limitations in the law.""It is unclear how many of the nation's roughly 2,800 compounding pharmacies would fall into the new category, but initial estimates put the number at fewer than 500. They would be defined not by their sales volume, but by whether they make products that are at high risk for contamination and sell them across state lines.Ever since the meningitis outbreak, the FDA has been pilloried by Republicans in Congress, who say the agency should have been more aggressive in its oversight of NECC.The FDA concedes as much but has argued that a complex legal landscape has hampered its ability to regulate the industry since compounding pharmacies have historically been regulated by the states and have not been required to register with the FDA.The proposed legislation encourages greater communication among states and between states and the FDA.

I am constantly defending my city. We are not all about conservative unfashionable suits and black clunky shoes. Our residents have taste, are well educated, well traveled, and cosmopolitan. Our city has money: even in this economy and even with sequestration, the government creates a little bubble around D.C. that isolates it from the worst economic woes.True, our aesthetic is overall understated -- we can't be flashy or gaudy, mostly because of the government thing -- but that makes our style and culture more refined.

You certainly know of the impact that Michelle Obama has had on the style culture in D.C., but here are 9 other reasons why Washington, D.C. is not as unfashionable as you might think!1. The culinary and restaurant scene is thriving. Arguably one of the best chefs in the country, Jose Andres, is based here in D.C. Think Jaleo, Zaytinya, Oyamel, and more. If he doesn't do it for you, how about Fabio Trabocchi, James Beard award-winner, who left D.C. for arch rival New York City but came back to D.C.... and is opening Casaluca and Fiola Mare after the amazing success of Fiola. 2. The ultra-luxury Capella Hotel Group chose Georgetown to open its first property in the United States just last month. With the Grill Room, The Rye Bar, and the Rooftop Bar, this is a destination not only for overnight travelers, but for D.C. residents as well. 3. Washington, D.C. is the birthplace of Andrￃﾩ Leon Talley, former editor-at-large of Vogue magazine. ""Andrￃﾩ doesn't have fashion. Andrￃﾩ himself is fashion,""- Manolo Blahnik4. Sadie Lincoln, barre3 founder, opened her first barre3 location on the East Coast right here in Georgetown. Rag and Bone also chose D.C. as their first store location outside of New York. Apparently, D.C. residents are open to new workout trends and do like fashion... 5. We have our own crop of D.C.-born and bred designers, including Hugh & Crye, launched in 2009. This brand has become so popular, the founders are even featured in American Express ads. 6. Men's fashion in general is actually booming in D.C., as shown by the recent opening of SuitSupply, or made to measure custom work by Alton Lane or Michael Andrews Bespoke. And, J. Crew is opening a men's only store in Tysons (the only one in this region). 7. Designers are traveling to D.C. in person to showcase their latest collections, most recently Jason Wu and Diane Von Furstenberg. 8. For the first time, we have D.C.-based commentators such as Lauren Rothman (a fellow HuffPost Blogger) talking about DC style and fashion on national television, including on E! Tonight and CNN. 9. Style also involves culture, and culture is hard to beat here in D.C. region. The city boasts 85 theaters, 100-plus art galleries and museums and 17 Smithsonian Institution museums.

Prolonged exposure to air pollution could be linked to heart attacks and strokes by speeding the hardening of the arteries -- a condition known as atherosclerosis that is linked with heart disease, according to new research.The study showed a link between higher concentrations of particulate air pollution and faster thickening of the inner two layers of the carotid artery, as well as a link between slowed progression of atherosclerosis with decreasing air pollution. The findings are published in the journal PLOS Medicine, and are based on data from 5,362 people ages 45 to 84 who came from six U.S. metro areas that were part of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA Air). Over three years, researchers estimated home air pollution levels of all the study participants, as well as their blood vessel health. On average, the study participants all experienced an average increase in carotid artery thickness of 14 micrometers each year. However, people who lived in more polluted areas experienced faster thickening, compared with those breathing cleaner air. ""Linking these findings with other results from the same population suggests that persons living in a more polluted part of town may have a 2 percent higher risk of stroke as compared to people in a less polluted part of the same metropolitan area,"" Sara Adar, an assistant epidemiology professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health, said in a statement."

8,PARENTING,What You Need to Know About Early Elective Deliveries,"Leah Binder, Contributor
President and CEO of The Leapfrog Group",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/early-elective-deliveries_us_5b9d008ee4b03a1dcc83aae7,The prevalence of early elective deliveries perfectly embodies the five biggest problems in our health system today.,2013-04-26,"This July 25, 2006 handout photo provided by the March of Dimes Foundation shows a baby in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the Albany Medical Center in Albany, N.Y. About 15 million premature babies are born every year _ more than 1 in 10 of the worldￂﾒs births and a bigger problem than previously believed, according to the first country-by-country estimates of this obstetric epidemic. The startling toll: 1.1 million of these fragile newborns die as a result, and even those who survive can suffer lifelong disabilities. (AP Photo/Jennifer Coate, March of Dimes Foundation)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d008e240000500094e7d9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The prevalence of early elective deliveries perfectly embodies the five biggest problems in our health system today. These are births scheduled without a medical reason between 37 and 39 completed weeks of pregnancy. Below I explain how -- but keep reading, because I do have some words of optimism in the end.  Problem 1: Too Much Unnecessary Care Overuse and unnecessary care accounts for anywhere from one-third to one-half of all health care costs, which equal hundreds of billions of dollars, in addition to the half-a-trillion per year experts attribute to lost productivity and disability.  Early elective deliveries are unnecessary, according to advice by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, that has been repeated for more than 30 years (that's not a typo -- 30 years), a point reinforced recently at a press conference. This is a message carried by several other highly respected organizations like Childbirth Connection, the March of Dimes and the Association of Women's Health, Obstetric & Neonatal Nurses (AWHONN). All national health plans concur. Nonetheless, we saw a dramatic escalation in the rates of these deliveries from the 1990s to the first decade of the new century.  Problem 2: Avoidable Harm to Patients This is one of health care's most common problems. The statistics are staggering. Here's an example: Roughly a quarter of patients admitted to a hospital will be subject to some form of medical error. Would you get in your car if you thought you had a one in four chance of harm during the drive?  Early elective deliveries harm women and newborns. Babies born at 37-39 completed weeks gestation are at much higher risk of death. They are also at a far higher risk for harms like respiratory problems and admission to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).  Problem 3: Billions of Dollars are Being Wasted  A report by the Institute of Medicine Health suggests a third or more of health costs are wasted. The cost of these unnecessary, harmful early elective deliveries was estimated in a study in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology to be nearly $1 billion per year.  Problem 4: Perverse Incentives in How We Pay for Care Traditionally, health plans, Medicare and Medicaid pay providers for whatever services they deliver, regardless of whether the service truly benefits the patient. An excellent new book called The Incentive Cure points out (as does a plethora of other literature that could fill several libraries) how we end up with an epidemic of perverse incentives.   The harsh truth about early elective deliveries is that our payment system encourages them. They generate admissions to NICUs, and NICUs are profit centers. Studies suggest that reducing the rate of these deliveries to a reasonable number could eliminate as many as one-half million NICU days, which could lower health costs for the U.S. But this would force hospitals to take a big financial hit. To their credit, in my experience, once hospitals recognize they have a problem with early elective deliveries, they don't think twice about taking that hit. States like South Carolina and Texas are trying to reverse the incentives, as are many employers. Unfortunately, they are the exception that proves the terrible rule of insane payment incentives.  Problem 5: Lack of Transparency We have far more information available to us to compare and select a new car than we do to choose where to go for lifesaving health care.  Transparency galvanizes change like nothing else. Early elective deliveries exemplify that: Despite warnings over the years from medical societies and highly respected national organizations, the rates of these deliveries have been rising for decades. That stopped when a purchaser-driven organization, The Leapfrog Group (my organization), started reporting early elective delivery rates by hospitals in 2010. Suddenly, the rates started declining. Earlier this year, Leapfrog released the 2012 data showing that the national rate for early elective deliveries is 11.2 percent, down from 17 percent in 2010. This is a voluntary survey, with nearly 800 hospitals providing the data willingly. Consumers deserve to know these rates for every hospital delivering babies in the country.  Now for a Dose of Optimism We have a glimpse of success in ending early elective deliveries. Sparked by public reporting, we have seen a growing cadre of providers, policymakers and consumer advocates uniting to address this problem, and the Department of Health & Human Services declared early elective deliveries as a top priority issue. Regional coalitions are also vowing to end the practice in their community.  The next step is for purchasers and consumers to keep up the pressure because that will only help in encouraging real change. And we need to apply that model across the board -- the business community should also work together to address the five big problems in health care that have a direct impact on their own employees' health and their business' bottom line. The key message here for all groups is this: Don't financially reward the wrong care and demand transparency.  The post first appeared on Forbes.com"

11,PARENTING,How to Tell a Story That Needs to Be Told,"Steph Thompson, Contributor

Business owners and residents of the closed section were allowed to return to their properties today while under escort of city staff.

I reaffirmed this assessment shortly after I attended a conference on the power of the narrative at Boston University a few weeks back.Oh, and after the bombs went off at the Boston Marathon last week.I had waved good-bye, got on a train and took it to Back Bay. I stopped to admire Copley Square. I took a picture, struck in the moment by the overwhelming whiff of history I got in a single breath. Boston. That tea party thing. The very beginnings of this great country. ""My Country T'is of Thee"" played softly in my head.At the conference, I met reporters who covered the world's great wars and atrocities. I met many of the people who bring us the news. I met a professor of policy and writing from Harvard. We all talked about how to tell people stories that will compel them to act. But the conclusion we came to was alarming: we don't really know. A week-and-a-half later I saw on the screen of my iPad bombs going off where I had stood in Boston. Where I had stopped with a wow of appreciation at the relatively recent creation of a place dedicated to freedom. And when I read the Times, I was told they talked to a Saudi who ran from the scene. They talked to him because of his nationality. And then, the countries' newspaper of record quoted someone as saying, ""This feels like Bagdad."" This is why I don't show my children news. I don't like all the innuendo and connotations about peoples and places that are thrown out so blithely. My Lebanese friend and I huff and puff at the dismissive depiction of Arab culture and people. It turns my stomach that I can't really trust anything I'm being told anymore, because I understand that they are not simply trying to inform us, they are, instead, trying to capture our interest. And the readers are thinking ""Where are the Arabs who did this?"" and the news gives them the running Arab, an innocent bystander who happens to love hummus -- just like the rest of us. I laughed with the Syrian guys about it at Costco the other day. As a parent, I trickle out news to my kids in dribs and drabs, trying to include context and explanation and humanity. These are what a story needs if it is going to be told. Pictures paint a thousand words, so I keep their little eyes from lighting on disturbing images. We have no television, and their limited Internet surfing may turn up an image or two but they don't likely linger for long. They are anxious to get back to their video games and comedies, all focused, it seems, around rude sexual humor.This is my choice. How I Met Your Mother lets them sleep at night with smiles.  I tell them we are all the same. I tell them we need to open our minds and listen. I tell them that people aren't bad. Even Arabs. Arabs are Alex who owns the deli that still carries your favorite Doritos. I tell them that some people are just angry, and they feel helpless, and that is sad for them and for us all. I tell them we need to have empathy for every living soul. That needs to be our narrative, our legacy to our children.  That is what they decided, in Boston, a long time ago.  Right?This article appeared in Ms. Thompson's Fearless Parenting column, which appears every other Thursday on BrooklynPaper.com."
12,PARENTING,What to Expect During Your Teen's Senior Year of High School,"Dr. Barbara Greenberg, Contributor

Yes, boredom.",2013-04-25,"A stressed out college or high school student hiding behind piles of books on top of his desk. He is wearing glasses, and has brown hair.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d182324000050005372b6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Senior year of high school is a mixed bag. It's not Santa's gift bag, but is instead a bag full of emotional joys, disappointments, separations and boredom. Yes, boredom.Let's start with first semester of senior year. Both teens and parents are fretting over college applications, deadlines for these applications and the impending separation from their parents and high school. First semester of senior year is, in my experience, the most difficult time period for teens and their well-intentioned but anxious parents. Second semester of senior year is a different story entirely. Teens are excited or let down by which colleges they have been accepted into or rejected from if they are going to college. Next up is prom, which involves hundreds of dollars in preparation and lots of anxiety about whether or not they will be invited to the prom. These days, our teen sons have to contend with ""promposals,"" which refers to asking girls to the prom with exceptionally creative invitations. They risk being rejected if their banner or other sort of invite is considered too low-key. I must say that I feel sorry for the teen boys. I also have equal sympathy for the teen girls. I believe that many of them feel that they can't say no to a young man who has gone all out to create an incredibly high-impact invitation. The teens worry about having a good time at the prom and about how the photos will turn out. This is no small thing, these photos. They will be with the teens through a lifetime. The prom is a milestone and a life marker.After the college news and prom, teens start to complain about being bored. Just this week, I spoke to a large group of teens who spoke about this sense of boredom that sets in during the second half of senior year. They are unclear about what to do with their time. Many feel ill at ease when they don't have clear goals to strive for. My concern is that they are at risk to get into trouble during this time period.As usual, I have advice for parents. I don't want your teens to make bad decisions or to get into unsafe situations during this time period. I suggest:1. Get your teens get involved in some sort of employment or volunteer activities during this time period. Everyone needs to feel necessary and needed somewhere.2. Help them maintain structure in their lives. As we know, teens thrive with structure.3. Do not become lax with rules. We do not want teens to throw caution to the wind and stay out late partying.4. Pay particular attention to their possible use of alcohol and other drugs.AND5. Talk to your second semester seniors about how your expectations for responsible behavior still exist despite their imminent departure from home.Good luck and may all of your kids have a balance of fun, work and structure in their lives as they complete their senior year."

If you doubt yourself throughout the day, just whisper a little reminder: Don't forget to be awesome. Awesomeness is happiness.",2013-04-25,2013-04-25-601783_10151937267003712_731249794_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-04-25-601783_10151937267003712_731249794_n.jpg,"The Grade 3 class at Bali International School in Bali, Indonesia have been studying happiness and have become little experts on the habits of happiness for children. Today, for other children around the globe, they share their ideas on how to have a happy morning.(Edited by their official secretary, Ibu Erin Threlfall)15 Things You Can Do to Have a Happy Morning:   1. Smile Turn those corners up and just smile! Everyone knows that smiling tells your brain that you are happy, so go on and just smile!2. Get up to watch the sunrise and listen to the birds. Sunrises are so pretty, and the birds sound really wonderful. If you can't do this, then look at something that makes you happy and listen to great music. This is sure to make you happy! 3. Get plenty of sleep Let's be real here: Everyone likes to stay up late and do all kinds of fun things, but sleep is so important if you want to avoid the grumpies. No one likes to be all sleepy in the morning and have your mom and dad yelling for you to get up. So avoid all the grumpies and shouties: Get plenty of rest so you can wake up and be happy! 4. Stretch and exercise Your blood will get going and your body will feel better. Don't be lazy! Stretch for happiness.5. Take time to look at nature Quiet time in the morning is wonderful. Just look out your window and appreciate the trees. Nature always brings a smile to our faces!6. Play in the garden Play is fun! Fun=happiness. Enough said.7. Take a hot shower Refresh your body and get energized. Hot showers always make me feel great!8. Enjoy your healthy breakfast Put those sugary things down! A healthy breakfast is important for your brain. Sugary stuff will just make you feel all yucky later on. So eat a healthy breakfast like fruit and yogurt and you will feel so much happier!9. Express your gratitude Tell someone something that you are happy about, or write in your gratitude journal. Starting your day thinking about the good stuff makes you feel good. Then you look for the good stuff all day long so that you have something to share the next day. 10. Make someone else happy Nothing more to say on this one, it is just awesomeness!11. Share a good memory with someone while you have your breakfast Good memories make you so happy! Share away!! 12. Try to make someone else laugh Be silly! Tell jokes! Tickle your little sister! Just make someone else laugh. Keep the jokes simple, though. Tricky jokes can fail in the morning.13. Dance!  Put on your favorite song and dance your tooshy off! Dancing=happiness14. Set yourself up for success: Get organized the night before There is nothing worse than rushing around in the morning trying to find what you need- that is definitely going to make your morning stressful and make you a grumpus. Just pack your bag, lay out your clothes, and look at your calendar for the next day before you go to bed. An organized morning means less mean mom faces, and that is happiness.15. Be Awesome You are awesome, so just be you! If you know that you are awesome, and remind yourself that you are awesome, you are sure to do more awesome things. If you doubt yourself throughout the day, just whisper a little reminder: Don't forget to be awesome. Awesomeness is happiness.  Want more advice on being happy? Just write and ask your question.
