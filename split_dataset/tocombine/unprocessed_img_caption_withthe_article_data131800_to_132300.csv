I think the man above and my mother just led me in the right direction",2014-01-14,"AKRON, OH - MAY 2: LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers is joined by his mother Gloria James as he receives the Maurice Podoloff Trophy as the 2009-10 NBA Most Valuable Player presented by Kia Motors on May 2, 2010 at James A Rhodes Arena on the University of Akron campus in Akron, Ohio.

For Miami Heat superstar LeBron James, that woman happens to be his mom. In a touching essay penned for The Shriver Report, a non-profit media initiative detailing the reality of American women's lives, the 29-year-old writes of the sacrifices his mother, Gloria James, made while raising him as single mom. ""You think LeBron James is a champion? Gloria James is a champion too. She’s my champion,"" the athlete writes in the first-person piece, before detailing the the hardships his mother faced when she had him at 16-years-old. James writes that he and his mom lived with his grandmother in a ""great big house"" in Akron, OH. But at age three, his grandmother died and the family lost the house:  We moved around from place to place -- a dozen times in three years. It was scary. It was catch as catch can, scraping to get by. My mom worked anywhere and everywhere, trying to make ends meet. But through all of that, I knew one thing for sure: I had my mother to blanket me and to give me security. She was my mother, my father, my everything. She put me first. I knew that no matter what happened, nothing and nobody was more important to her than I was. I went without a lot of things, but never for one second did I feel unimportant or unloved.James spent a year with Walker, honing his skills on the court, attending school, and seeing his mom every weekend. Once his mom was able to rent a two-bedroom apartment with the help of a government-assistance program, James moved back in. Fans of the basketball star know what happens next: In 2003, the Cleveland Cavaliers recruited James out of high school with the first overall pick in the NBA draft. Now playing for the Miami Heat, James is a nine-time NBA All-Star, four-time NBA most valuable player and two-time NBA Finals MVP.The Miami Heat forward is also a proud dad to kids, LeBron Jr. and Bryce. In his Shriver Report essay, James said everything he knows ""about loving and caring"" and ""being present in [his] children’s lives"" he picked up from his mother. This isn't the first time James has voiced his admiration for his mom. In a 2009 interview with ""60 Minutes,"" the athlete credited Gloria James with keeping him off the streets and out of trouble when he was growing up.""I never walked down that path -- I don't know why. I think the man above and my mother just led me in the right direction,"" James explained. ""[My mom] gets all the credit in the world for helping me become the man who I am today.""Head over to ShriverReport.org to read James' full essay. Keep in touch!

After three decades of living together, the Democratic senator from New York's long-time roomie is leaving Washington, and leaving Schumer without a ready supply of breakfast foods.For 31 years, Schumer has lived with Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.) in a Capitol Hill rowhouse , which is famous for its high-powered residents and for its slovenliness. For example, a third resident, Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), was said to be handy at killing the home's rats, in a 2007 New York Times story about the place. Schumer, for his part, was described by the Times as stubbornly refusing to make his bed, and being ""prone to a blatant disregard for conserving a most precious household resource, cereal.""“I love cereal,” Mr. Schumer told the paper, while eating what was said to be a ""second bowl of granola"" out of a box that had just been bought by Miller.If this sounds like just your sort of living situation, you're in luck. Miller recently announced his retirement at the end of this year, leading to this: Want to know more about politicians' filthy lives? Check out this video tour that CNN got of the congressional digs that inspired the Amazon show Alpha House:Miller owns the house. He bought the place for $90,000 in 1977; Schumer moved in in 1982, with Durbin arriving 10 years later. The Washington Post says no one yet knows if Schumer and Durbin will bring someone new to replace Miller, who would become an absentee landlord, or if the lawmakers will be looking for a new place (most likely not) to hang their hats. It's “not something we’ve talked about,” a Miller spokesperson told the paper."

Sometimes, the dreams are straightforward in their meaning to the dreamer: a long-lost friend reappears, a tropical beach beckons or the lottery jackpot is within reach.But dreams don't always tell a simple story, and the field of dream research becomes even more fascinating when people from different cultures and backgrounds report having similar dreams.""Dreams are a universal language, creating often elaborate images out of emotional concepts,"" explains Suzanne Bergmann, a licensed social worker and professional dream worker for more than 16 years.Bergmann, who is part of the experienced team of Dream Reflectors at DreamsCloud that provide feedback and insight about dreams, has identified 14 common images found in dreams posted to the DreamsCloud user-generated dreams database.  ""There's no single, definitive meaning for symbols and images in dreams,"" Bergmann notes. ""But just as a smile usually means that someone is happy, these dream images are so common, that they do have a generally accepted meaning.""1. Being ChasedThis is one of the most commonly reported dreams. Mostly because the anxiety we feel in the dream is so vivid, that it makes it easier for us to remember them. Often, the reason for these dreams comes not from the fear of actually being chased, but rather what we're running from. Chase dreams help us to understand that we may not be addressing something in our waking lives that requires our attention.2. Water Water frequently represents our emotions or our unconscious minds. The quality of the water (clear vs. cloudy; calm vs. turbulent) often provides insight into how effectively we are managing our emotions.3. Vehicles Whether a car, airplane, train or ship, the vehicles in our dream can reflect what direction we feel our life is taking, and how much control we think we have over the path ahead of us. Vehicles can give us the power to make a transition and envision ourselves getting to our destination -- or highlight the obstacles we think we are facing and need to work through.4. People Seeing other people in your dream often is a reflection of the different aspects of the self. The people in dreams can relate to characteristics that need to be developed. Specific people directly relate to existing relationships or interpersonal issues we need to work through. Dreaming of a lover, in particular, is frequently symbolic of an aspect of ourselves, from which we feel detached.5. School or Classroom It's a very common situation for people in dreams to find themselves in a school or classroom, often confronted with a test that they aren't prepared to take. This is a great example of a ""dream pun"" -- the mind using a word or concept and giving it a different definition. The ""lesson"" or ""test"" we face inside the school or classroom is frequently one we need to learn from our past -- which is one reason these dreams are often reported by people who have long since finished school.6. Paralysis Unknown to most people, the body is actually encountering a form of paralysis during dreaming, which prevents it from physically performing the actions occurring in their dreams, therefore dreaming about paralysis frequently represents the overlap between the REM stage and waking stage of sleep. Dreaming about paralysis can also indicate that the dreamer feels he or she lacks control in their waking life.7. Death Although death is often perceived as negative, it's often more directly related to dramatic change happening for the dreamer -- the end of one thing, in order to make room for something new.8. Flying Flying in a dream, and how effectively or poorly it's done, relates to how much control we feel we have in our lives, and whether we are confident and able to achieve our goals. High flying is one of the most euphoric dreams imaginable, while flying or ""skimming"" low to the ground or being caught in obstacles like power lines can be immensely frustrating.9. FallingNot all falling dreams are scary and negative. Some dreamers report a type of slow falling that indicates serenity and the act of letting go. Often, falling uncontrollably from a great height indicates something in waking our life that feels very much out of control.10. Nudity Emotional or psychological exposure or vulnerability is very often expressed in dreams through nudity. The body part that's exposed can give more insight into the emotion that our dreams are helping us to understand.11. Baby Dreaming of a baby often represents something new: It might be a new idea, new project at work, new development or the potential for growth in a specific area of our waking life.12. Food Food symbolizes energy, knowledge or nourishment and is directly related to our intellect, emotions and spirituality. Food can also be a manifestation of idioms like, ""food for thought,"" and reveal that we may be ""hungry"" for new information and insights.13. House Houses frequently represent the dreamer's mind. Different levels or rooms may relate to difference aspects of the individual dreamer and different degrees of consciousness. The basement often represents what has been neglected, or what the dreamer is not aware of in his or her waking life, while bedrooms relate to intimate thoughts and feelings -- those closest to the dreamer's core self.14. Sex Sex in dreams can simply be an outlet for sexual expression. But dreams about sex can also symbolize intimate connections with one's self and others, and the figurative integration of new information.Despite the commonality shared by many dream symbols, it is important to point out that only the dreamer can truly interpret the meaning of their dream and how these symbols and their meanings may connect to the specific events occurring in their waking life.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this blog incorrectly attributed quotes by Suzanne Bergmann to Susan Baragia.

They also know how to wow a tourist with the best of both. Argentina provides that perfect travel balance with a pair of destinations that are sure to seduce all the senses and sate any travel palate. So, next time you are hungry for some serious southern hospitality, head to Argentina  and load up on an ample serving of both Buenos Aires and Mendoza. Rest assured no matter how full the forks and corks and cultural offerings may leave you, you will leave Argentina begging for more. Here's a small taste of what you can expect if heading in that decadent destination.Buenos Aires For city slickers looking to get their culture groove on, Buenos Aires  delivers it in spades. Known as the Paris of South America or in some circles, Eva Peron's City, Buenos Aires is by far the most European city in all of South America. It's the second largest city, second only to Brazil's Sao Paolo in South America. From art and architecture to their turbulent historical history and an unrivaled café and culinary culture, Buenos Aires is can't miss for savvy and sophisticated travelers.Once you arrive, take up residence at the French and Art Deco designed Sofitel Hotel. Set in the city's art district by many embassies in the city, this neoclassical structure will give you a window in to what Bueons Aires was like in its celebrated hey-day.If looking for a boutique experience, head to the iconic Algodon Mansion to see and be seen by the urban elite. You can do lunch, grab a rooftop cocktail or get one of the best spa services in the city. I was dreaming and drooling in no time after my relaxing, yet youth infusing facial.For an artful appetizer, indulge in Fortabat where lunch can be enjoyed at the on-site restaurant. Or opt to hit the streets along with the Portenos, the chic elite of Buenos Aires. Grab a steak sandwich on the go, drizzled with chimichurri sauce at one of the local parillas. Then head to Palermo Soho to do some damage at those chic shops. Cocktail, culinary and couture abound in this ever-trendy outpost.Finish your visit in the tony neighborhood of Recoletta. Enjoy a long and luxurious coffee at one of the city's classic cafes, yet another glance back to old world Argentina. Pay your respect to Eva Peron at one of the world's best cemeteries. It's best to arrive late in the day at Recoletta when the lighting is pitch-perfect and highly evocative. On our final night in, we partook in the celebration of Argentina's most celebrated grape during their annual Malbec World Day where Argentina's top winemakers toasted their local star. This event is happening in key, eno-inspired cities simultaneously, all over the world. We were just fortunate to be with the Portenos celebrating like a local.Mendoza The first things you see as you drive away from Francisco Gabrielli's International airport in Mendoza are the vines on their lot. So, if you didn't know you were deep in wine country when you arrived, it becomes crystal clear once you exit the airport and kick-start your eno-inspired adventure. Coined the Napa of South America, the fifth largest wine region in the world is producing two thirds of Argentina's wines. There are other grand regions in Argentina, from San Juan and La Rioja and Patagonia to several other smaller regions. Mendoza's just the mightiest with vineyard acreage greater than New Zealand and Australia combined. Malbec, originating from France is very different from its French relatives. It is the region's definitive red and the most widely planted. Equally distinctive in the Mendoza portfolio is Torrontes, the only grape wholly indigenous to Argentina with its Muscat-y fragrance with hints of peach and citrus, yet spicy on the palate. It stands up well to the Argentinean smoked meats, which abound in town.Anxious to get in to the forks and the corks, we checked in to the fairly new business savvy Intercontinental Hotel  in Mendoza. We didn't waste a minute as we then headed straight to the wineries. It was clear within minutes of our visit that the agri-tourism in Mendoza was more robust than ever. We had a leisurely lunch at Bodega Vistalba's award winning La Bourgogne Restaurant. It is one of the properties in town offering accommodations on site, a very evocative proposition as it can take an hour to get from Mendoza's city center to the wineries. Visits continued at the Dutch owned Salentein winery, home to Killka restaurant and one of the most celebrated art galleries in all of Mendoza. Local art and artists are highly revered widely throughout Argentina and very much so in Mendoza. The only competition to the art is the backdrop of the picturesque Andes Mountains. The Andes frame the modern property, making the architectural wonder pop, causing it to look like a rather impressive, site specific art installation.Kicking off our next day of eno-activity was a visit to the family owned and run Zuccardi Winery. My previous visit in '09 had me pruning their vines. This visit I continued in the work vein harvesting my own olives, which we later pressed. Taking a bottle of my own oil back may be one of my best travel trophies to date. Lunch at their newer restaurant Pan & Olive was a great way to celebrate the harvest to table trophy. The food was traditional; simple yet sublime.That evening we broke bread at Nadia OF Restaurante in Mendoza's city center. The noted Nadia Haron's husband, Jose Manuel Ortega of O. Fournier Wine Group joined us for the meal. Ortega meticulously paired his gorgeous award winning wines throughout the sumptuous meal. The restaurant was teaming with foodie fans as the seemingly bohemian Nadia had just been given the top chef award in Argentina. It was easy to see why. We were privy to the Spanish native's four-course degustacion, an El Bulli-like experience. The influence was obvious, yet her own.With husband Jose's financial background, I felt I was being given insider stock info as he shared the wineries newest offering. His winery was selling both wine villas and plots. You could buy a plot and they would harvest the grapes, make the wine and sell your wine for you with your own label on it. This was at a very low risk. You soak up his years of expertise and set up costs, which could then lead to you pouring your own world class wine first time out. It is an otherwise unheard of option at such a low cost. The return on the minimal investment was seemingly, quick and easy. I was shaking the change out of the bottom of my purse to explore my own eno-options.Even more enviable than the financial fun was the notion of having your own label. We're told that tip-top investors and jetsetters from around the globe that have been there, done that, own that, were jumping in, hand over vine to get in on the vintner activity. As Fournier mentioned, ""What is more impressive than pulling out your own wine at a business dinner?"" Hard to argue as vintner visions were already dancing in my head. We were led to believe that he was the only vine in town with this groundbreaking grape offer. Once we arrived at the idyllic Tupungato Winery the next morning, we were told that Tupungato like O. Fournier had wine plots and wine villas on offer as well. It was becoming a point of practice in the region. Not only that, Tupungato also had golf and polo villas for sale, which paired up nicely with their golf course and polo fields. True to form, I was leaving Argentina with an even greater appetite for their grapes and plates than when I arrived. In addition, I was busy placing my order for my next visit in. Next time back, I am ordering a villa with my wines. Now back to shaking out that purse...To STAY:Buenos Aires -  Sofitel Hotel   Algodon Mansion   Mendoza Intercontinental To PLAY: Argentina Tourism Buenos Aires Mendoza To WINE: World Malbec Day"
