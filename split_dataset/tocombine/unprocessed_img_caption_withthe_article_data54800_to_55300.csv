0,WOMEN,Brock Turner Repeatedly Used Alcohol As An Excuse For The Sexual Assault He Committed,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brock-turner-drinking-party-culture_us_5758259be4b0e39a28ac015c,"He says he wants to speak out against ""binge drinking and sexual promiscuity,"" but won't admit his guilt.",2016-06-08,Brock Turner was convicted of three felony sexual assault charges. He says his crime only happened because he was drunk.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575843691500002f001b860c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Convicted sex offender Brock Turner argued in letters submitted in court that his behavior on the night of his crime was due to alcohol and a party culture on campus, something some of his supporters suggested as well. Turner was found guilty of three felony sexual assault charges in March and sentenced last week to six months in jail with three years' probation. The lenient sentence has evoked international outrage following a widely shared statement from his victim and a letter defending Turner from his father. The Huffington Post obtained court documents this week, including letters of support for Turner submitted to the Judge Aaron Perksy and a report from the probation officer in his case, after the former Stanford University student's conviction.Turner and his family have not acknowledged in any of their statements that he committed a sexual assault, let alone a crime. He sexually assaulted an unconscious woman next to a dumpster on Stanford's Palo Alto campus, digitally penetrating the woman, near a fraternity party where he met her. Two graduate students passing by interrupted him and pinned him down as other witnesses called police. After the guilty verdict, Turner continued to insist to his probation officer that the encounter was consensual. He said the victim had simply slipped behind a wooden shed and then he got down on the ground with her and started kissing and fingering her until he got nauseous and decided to walk away. ""I naively assumed that it was accepted to be intimate with someone in a place that wasn't my room,"" Turner said in a statement attached to the report. Turner said of the moment the graduate student tackled him, ""I repeatedly tried to get him to talk about whatever his strife was, but he refused to do so."" Police arrived on the scene, and Turner said he was ""shocked to realize it was me who they were arresting.""But the probation report notes that Turner was acting aggressively toward women earlier in the night. He was among a group of guys talking to the victim and her sister outside the party and, according to the probation report, was acting ""very aggressive, trying to kiss various females at the party."" He tried to kiss the victim's sister on multiple occasions and she pushed him away each time. The sister left soon after to help a friend who drank too much alcohol and the victim was gone when she returned. The report and letters associated to it repeatedly bring up Turner's alcohol intake and the victim's on that night as a reason for why he sexually assaulted her, even if he doesn't acknowledge that. ""If I really wanted to get to know her, I should have asked for her number, rather than asking her to go back to my room,"" Turner told his probation officer in a pre-sentence interview. ""Being drunk I just couldn't make the best decisions and neither could she."" The victim responded to his argument that they were both heavily intoxicated in the statement she read in court:Alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked. Having too much to drink was an amateur mistake that I admit to, but it is not criminal. Everyone in this room has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much, or knows someone close to them who has had a night where they have regretted drinking too much. Regretting drinking is not the same as regretting sexual assault. We were both drunk, the difference is I did not take off your pants and underwear, touch you inappropriately, and run away. That’s the difference.Turner further stated in a second statement attached to the report that he wants to become an example for others about avoiding the college party culture. Below is an excerpt: I want to earn a college degree in any capacity that I am capable to do so. And in accomplishing this task, I can make the people around me and society better through the example I will set. I’ve been a goal oriented person since my start as a swimmer. I want to take what I can from who I was before this situation happened and use it to the best of my abilities moving forward. I know I can show people who were like me the dangers of assuming what college life can be like without thinking about the consequences one would potentially have to make if one were to make the same decisions that I made. I want to show that people’s lives can be destroyed by drinking and making poor decisions while doing so. One needs to recognize the influence that peer pressure and the attitude of having to fit in can have on someone. One decision has the potential to change your entire life. I know I can impact and change people’s attitudes towards the culture surrounded by binge drinking and sexual promiscuity that protrudes through what people think is at the core of being a college student. I want to demolish the assumption that drinking and partying are what make up a college lifestyle. I made a mistake, I drank too much, and my decisions hurt someone. But I never ever meant to intentionally hurt [redacted].He apologized to the victim for the pain he caused her and said his actions were ""unforgivable,"" but he did not acknowledge that he assaulted her. Margaret M. Quinn, a former federal prosecutor and current Municipal Court Judge in Ohio, similarly argued in a letter submitted to Judge Persky that Turner could speak out about ""the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption, college partying, and the 'hook-up' culture on college campuses throughout the United States."" Quinn did not return a phone call from HuffPost on Wednesday. Turner had already paid a ""painful price"" of being banned from USA swimming and not participating in the Olympics, argued another letter of support from an administrator at Wright State University. Most of the letters of support argued that Turner was always a respectable advanced placement student in high school and behaved appropriately as a member of various swim teams. The vast majority did not try to insist on Turner's innocence of the crime, except for one from childhood friend Leslie Rasmussen that said she was sure the victim flirted with Turner and left willingly with him. Rasmussen insisted both Turner and the woman had too much to drink.""It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that alcohol increases emotions and feelings,"" Rasmussen wrote. ""I think this is all a huge misunderstanding. ... After the investigation, it should have found Brock to be innocent.""Turner added in that second statement that he never wants to drink again, writing: I will never put myself through an event where it will give someone the ability to question whether I really can be a betterment to society. I want no one, male or female, to have to experience the destructive consequences of making decisions while under the influence of alcohol. I want to be a voice of reason in a time where people’s attitudes and preconceived notions about partying and drinking have already been established. I want to let young people know, as I did not, that things can go from fun to ruined in just one night.The probation officer recommended that Turner avoid prison altogether. Instead, the officer said Turner should receive a county jail sentence and then probation for three years, in addition to other financial penalties and stipulations of getting employment and staying sober. Turner said he plans to study for a degree in electrical engineering. He also said he recently met with an Ohio judge and is in the process of establishing a program for high school and college students in which he ""speaks out against the college campus drinking culture and the sexual promiscuity that goes along with that,"" the officer added._______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter, focusing on higher education and sexual violence, and is based in New York.

2,CRIME,Pressure Builds On Judge Over California Sexual Assault Case,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/judge-brock-turner_us_5758200ee4b0ced23ca670b2,"""Six months for someone who viciously attacked a woman, especially after she was so brave to come forward, is outrageous.""",2016-06-08,This undated booking photo provided by Santa Clara County Sheriff shows Brock Turner a former Stanford University swimmer who received six months in jail for sexually assaulting an unconscious woman.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"U.S. Senator Barbara Boxer on Monday decried a California judge's decision to sentence a college athlete to just six months in jail for sexual assault, and signatures on an online petition calling for the jurist's ouster later passed 400,000.The sentence last week by Santa Clara County Judge Aaron Persky against former Stanford University swimmer Brock Turner gained international attention after a letter from the athlete's father to the judge that was posted online described the assault as ""20 minutes of action.""""Six months for someone who viciously attacked a woman, especially after she was so brave to come forward, is outrageous,"" Boxer said in a statement released late Monday.Asked for a comment on the controversy over his ruling, Santa Clara Superior Court spokesman Joseph Macaluso said Judge Persky is prohibited from commenting on the case because there may be an appeal.Last week, the victim in the case read a 12-page letter to the court detailing her feelings in the wake of the assault. It was later read millions of times online. The victim's name has not been released to the public.The uproar over the sentence is part of growing outrage in the United States over sexual assault on college campuses.In the Stanford case, prosecutors said that witnesses saw Turner, 20, on top of the woman as she lay motionless outside a fraternity party in January 2015. When Turner ran away, two students tackled and held him for police, prosecutors said.Turner in March was convicted of intent to rape an intoxicated and unconscious person, penetration of an intoxicated person and penetration of an unconscious person. His lawyer said on Tuesday that he was considering appealing the conviction and had filed a notice of intent to appeal with the court.An online petition at Change.org urging the removal of the judge had collected more than 400,000 clicks of support by Tuesday afternoon, in a largely symbolic gesture.Stanford law professor Michele Dauber has vowed to start a more formal recall effort against Persky, but that is a difficult process rarely used in California.International interest in the case has led media organizations to request interviews with the woman, but prosecutors said on Tuesday that she wished to remain anonymous.In a statement released by Santa Clara County Deputy District Attorney Alaleh Kianerci to CNN, the woman said that in addition to wanting to protect her privacy, she could better represent all woman if her name and image were not known.""I'm coming out to you simply as a woman wanting to be heard,"" she said in the statement to CNN. ""For now I am every woman.""(Additional reporting by Suzannah Gonzales in Chicago and Ben Klayman in Detroit; Editing by Sharon Bernstein, Bernard Orr)"
3,SPORTS,Top Soccer Official Says Trump Presidency Would Hurt U.S. World Cup Bid,Travis Waldron,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-united-states-2026-world-cup_us_575840aae4b0e39a28ac20d8,"""I think a co-hosted World Cup with Mexico would be trickier if Secretary Clinton isn't in the White House.""",2016-06-08,"Trump's racist rhetoric toward immigrants could imperil an American bid to host the 2026 World Cup, according to the head of U.S. Soccer.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575845921500002b00739825.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Donald Trump presidency could have a negative impact on the United States' efforts to host the 2026 World Cup, U.S. Soccer Federation President Sunil Gulati told reporters Tuesday.The United States and U.S. Soccer, the sport's American governing body, have harbored hopes of hosting the 2026 World Cup since Qatar snagged the rights for the 2022 tournament. And they have even considered a joint bid with Mexico -- which also has its eyes on the 2026 World Cup -- to help make it happen.But a Trump victory over Hillary Clinton in November could throw a wrench into that plan, Gulati said, according to ESPNFC.""I think the world's perception of the U.S. is affected by who is in the White House, yes, so it has some bearing, sure,"" Gulati said. ""I think a co-hosted World Cup with Mexico would be trickier if Secretary Clinton isn't in the White House.""Trump, now the presumptive Republican nominee, has incensed both American and Mexican political officials with racist and xenophobic rhetoric aimed at Latino immigrants. Since launching his bid for the White House, he has called Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals, threatened to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and, most recently, attacked an Indiana-born judge who is hearing a case against the real estate mogul as biased because of the judge's ""Mexican heritage.""The U.S. hasn't hosted the World Cup since 1994, and the occupant of the White House is not the only factor that will go into deciding the 2026 host, Gulati said. He pointed to the next two hosts, Russia and Qatar, which both have controversial leaders and human rights concerns, as evidence. But when FIFA selects the host of the 2026 World Cup in 2020, it seems clear that a president with a penchant for insulting everyone who doesn't look like him won't help efforts to bring soccer's flagship event back to the United States.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
4,ENTERTAINMENT,Here's The Real Reason Why Martha Stewart Refuses To Watch 'Orange Is The New Black',Cole Delbyck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heres-the-real-reason-martha-stewart-wont-watch-orange-is-the-new-black_us_5758313de4b0ced23ca68715,Total Piper move.,2016-06-08,Martha Stewart attends the 2015 Time 100 Gala in New York City.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/575834be130000dd0b383f29.jpeg?ops=crop_238_77_1314_790%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Although we're pretty sure Martha Stewart didn't duel a violent evangelical meth addict in the prison yard in the dead of winter, the lifestyle tycoon revealed she's let ""Orange is the New Black"" collect internet dust in her Netflix queue because nothing can measure up to experiencing prison firsthand. Speaking with Chelsea Handler on a recent episode of the comic's new talk show, ""Chelsea,"" Stewart addressed comparisons to her own orange-jumpsuit experience and the depiction of prison on television. “When you live through something like 'Orange Is the New Black,' the real characters are better,” she told Handler. ""It’s not as good as the real thing.”Beginning in October 2004, Stewart famously spent five months in an Alderson, West Virginia, federal prison for obstructing justice and making false statements during an SEC investigation into insider trading. After her release, she served five additional months on house arrest.While behind bars, however, Stewart had access to television, and recalled that one particular channel was a favorite among the inmates. “In prison, it was BET television at all times. I had to get up really early to watch the news,” she said. ""There’s only one TV available and you have to sit in hard chairs and look up like this at the TV. So if I wanted to watch the stock market and stuff like that, I had to get up really early and watch it by myself.”Pause for the image of Martha Stewart watching TV by herself at the crack of dawn in prison. Let's continue.Even though Stewart has no interest in ""OITNB,"" the Netflix series is very much aware of her story. In Season 3, Judy King, a character modeled after Stewart, was introduced to the Litchfield gang after being charged with tax evasion.King appeared sporadically throughout last season, but is expected to play a larger role when Season 4 debuts in June. (Netflix didn't spend all that time perfecting the Martha 'do for nothing.)"
5,POLITICS,Donald Trump's Vice Presidential Picking Process Sounds Dodgy As Hell,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-vice-president-pick_us_57586a02e4b0e39a28ac494b,Some poor sucker could get the surprise of his life.,2016-06-08,"But then who really -- really, really -- wants to be Donald Trump's VP?",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you're like, say, Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) -- who's given presumptive GOP presidential nominee and foaming man-possum Donald Trump three weeks to ""fix"" his campaign -- you might be nervously watching for signs that Trump is undertaking an effort to bring order to an organization that has lately lapsed into chaos. Giving a speech with a teleprompter in which the overt white-supremacist content was dialed back a notch might have been a good start. But then you read the interview that Trump just gave Bloomberg News and ... wow. I don't know, you guys. Go read the whole thing -- it's a genuine doozy.As Bloomberg's Michael Bender and Jennifer Jacobs report, there is much that seems off, perhaps even delusional, about how Trump sees the next part of his electoral strategy playing out. He seems not to understand how expensive an undertaking this race is going to be (or he's realizing that donors don't want to be associated with him), and he believes that living off the land of free media is sufficient to the task. Speaking of all that free media, he also seems to think that the issues that have dogged him over the past week -- Trump University and his disparagement of Judge Gonzalo Curiel -- are now effectively in the rear-view mirror.What might be most alarming to veteran GOP figures is how Trump details his process for choosing a running mate. Bender and Jacobs report that Trump has narrowed his search to four or five politicians, plus two ""respected military officials."" Of the latter two, Trump says that he probably won't choose them because he believes he will ""do very well on national security."" (For a counterpoint, see Ian Bremmer in Politico.)Why Trump would say he'd short-listed two military experts if he's not seriously thinking about choosing them is a genuine mystery. Maybe he reckons they'll be honored just to be on the short list? Trump says that the benefit of picking a politician is that the ""voters and the media"" will have already vetted the person. What this says is that Trump really isn't planning to vet his own candidates, which is generally seen as the essential thing to do when selecting a running mate. As a team of experts at the Bipartisan Policy Center laid out, there are five steps to picking a vice presidential candidate, which I've previously summarized like so:Take a deep breath, and come up with some names.So literally three of the steps involve the campaign personally vetting each candidate. Of course, you need to actually have a competent campaign to perform these tasks, and what Trump has is a gaggle of anger-management candidates fighting an anonymously sourced civil war with one other.Still more unnerving is the process by which he'll disclose his eventual selection. As Bender and Jacobs relate, there has been some tension within the campaign over this, in which ""some advisers have worried that Trump may decide on his own to post the announcement on Twitter one night with little warning."" But this actually sounds like the saner alternative after Trump describes what he'd really like to do:""I’d like to save it, give it the old fashioned way, right?” Trump said about keeping the announcement until the convention.Hold up now, let me get this straight: He's going to wait until the convention to make his pick, and it could end up being someone who has not offered Trump an endorsement but who Trump thinks will join up with him anyway? Ordinarily I'd say, ""Well, surely he wouldn't actually fail to apprise the selectee of his decision, and nail down whether they'd actually accept the position."" But Trump is so enamored of wielding the element of surprise, and so steeped in reality-television tropes, that I can genuinely imagine him springing it on some poor sucker, right there on the convention stage.You can see it, right? There's an audible gasp, the camera cuts to a shocked Marco Rubio, and some previously unseen emcee asks, ""Will Marco accept Trump's nomination? Find out after the break."" And then after the break, there are several more breaks, after which Rubio finally renders his decision. ""Donald, we'll try to make it work,"" he says, whereupon a torrent of balloons gently waft down from the rafters as Rubio's soul exits his body in the other direction.Don't get me wrong -- this would be, on a purely demented level, fun as hell to watch. But I would not, as a matter of practice, recommend this. Trump should definitely not put someone on his short list who has heretofore refused to endorse him, let alone actually name that person as his running mate.But who knows? The way things are going, he may not have a choice.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below."
6,BUSINESS,What A Hillary Clinton Nomination Means For The Glass Ceiling (Hint: Not Much),Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-glass-ceiling_us_57584835e4b0ced23ca69fe5,We've got a long way to go.,2016-06-08,"Hillary Clinton has given the glass ceiling a hairline fracture, but it's still very much intact.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5758815f1500002a00739951.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton just cracked the glass ceiling, the name we've given the invisible barrier that keeps women out of the topmost positions of power. But it is far from shattered. Indeed, the glass ceiling hangs over the corridors of power in the United States like a toxic gas.Even though women are nearly 47 percent of the workforce and a majority of the voting population, we are underrepresented in leadership positions in every facet of American life -- in business, politics, the nonprofit sector, education, religious institutions, the court system. In every case, men dominate.Despite the amazing fact that for the first time, a major political party is set to nominate a woman for president, there's little indication that a power shift is anywhere near imminent.""We’re very excited to see this particular glass ceiling broken,"" Serena Fong, vice president of government affairs at Catalyst, told The Huffington Post.""But the glass ceiling and the concrete ceiling, as it’s termed for women of color, are still in place,"" said Fong, whose nonprofit organization aims to advance women in the workplace.Women are kept out of leadership roles by a web of frustrating nonsense, according to an overwhelming amount of research on the subject and conversations HuffPost had with the analysts, consultants and experts who think about gender and work.These factors include deep and pervasive stereotypes about what a true leader looks like (white and male) and what women really want and are responsible for (babies and families) and how they should behave (nicely, no yelling!). The road to power is also blocked by long-established networks in which men mentor and support the advancement of those who remind them of themselves.If Clinton actually becomes president, then it's possible she'll have a transformative effect on our notions of what a leader looks like. You can't be it unless you see it, as the saying goes. ""Certainly having a woman president conveys to the world, but in particular to citizens of the U.S., that women are capable of achieving and holding a position of power in ways that will be consequential for them and for the world,"" Robin Ely, the faculty chair of Harvard Business School's Gender Initiative, told HuffPost earlier this year. ""I think it puts in our mind a different conception of what it means to be a leader.""Still, change is not going to happen quickly. Though women have seen progress over the past decades and now graduate from college at a higher rate than men and enter the workforce roughly at parity with men, they still do not advance up the ladder at the same rate. Only 4 percent of CEOs at S&P 500 firms are women, less than 20 percent of corporate board seats are occupied by women and the wage gap is still firmly in place, Fong noted. ""This is all evidence that we still have a long, long way to go,"" she said.Just this week, Fortune magazine announced that the number of female CEOs on the Fortune 500 declined last year, falling to 21 from 24 the previous year. Only one woman runs a top 10 corporation on Fortune's list: Mary Barra at General Motors.In addition to stereotyping and discrimination, women in business face systemic barriers to advancement, Fong notes. At a lot of companies, male managers will not offer women the opportunity to take on overseas roles -- necessary to jump to the C-suite -- because they assume women would prefer not to move their families, she said.Another study from Catalyst found that women with business degrees were tracked into staff positions in the corporate sector while their male peers got coveted profit and loss roles, which lead to faster-track advancement.""We're conditioned to expect men to be leaders and leaders to be men,"" said Kevin Miller, a researcher at the American Association of University Women and the co-author of a devastating report on women in leadership the organization released earlier this year.The report contains a blur of depressing statistics that show that the bias against women leaders isn't confined to buttoned-up corporations or the Senate. Even in the nonprofit world, where there are more women, they are still underrepresented in leadership positions. Only 21 out of 151 nonprofits in Massachusetts had boards with at least 50 percent women, the report notes. Even in primary and secondary education -- where women dominate -- they vanish at the top. Look:In politics, it's similarly bleak, as the AAUW report highlights. Women hold a little less than a quarter of state legislative roles. They make up 19.3 percent of the members of the House of Representatives. There are only 20 female Senators. Only six U.S. governors are female. There has never been a female U.S. Treasury secretary. And you know the deal with the president.Women who run for office do just as well as men, Miller said. ""They succeed at the same rate. But women don't put their name forward, they don't run,"" he said. But a woman who runs, more than once, and finally nabs the most coveted electoral position in the country and possibly the world -- well, that could change something, he said: ""Having a woman president could be transformational."""

Even so, both Clinton and Sanders opened offices in the largely red state. Sanders campaigned in person at rallies in Fargo, Grand Forks and Bismarck, while Clinton dispatched her husband, the former president, to appear on her behalf in Fargo.Clinton secured the endorsement of North Dakota’s current Democratic senator, Heidi Heitkamp, along with the bulk of the state’s former top Democratic officeholders, including former Gov. George Sinner, former Sens. Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad, former Rep. Earl Pomeroy, and former U.S. Attorney Tim Purdon.But the last time the state went for the Democratic presidential nominee in the general election was 1964.Due to its small population, North Dakota is the only state in the country that doesn’t require individuals to register in advance before voting.Tuesday’s primaries and caucuses marked the last statewide contests in the Democratic primary race.

However, it’s how he used his voice outside of music and acting that has truly inspired millions around the world.On Tuesday, the famed global activist -- who has fought relentlessly for decades for equality and justice everywhere -- was honored in New York with the 2016 Humanitarian Award. The honor was made on behalf of the Children’s Health Fund, an inspiring organization working to provide healthcare to underserved and vulnerable children across the country. Actor Morgan Freeman helped to make the moment even more special by presenting Belafonte with the award and praising his amazing accomplishments.“Harry Belafonte is an example of potential that will not be stopped,” Freeman told the crowd, which included former New York Mayor David Dinkins and current mayor Bill De Blasio.“What a talent he is. What a heart he has. What a life he has lived and what a difference he has made in millions of lives,” he added.Upon accepting his award, Belafonte thanked Freeman, a long-time friend of his, for the warm introduction. “I love Morgan Freeman,” he said, before cracking a joke about the Oscar-winning actor. “He took all my best parts and never asked for permission.”Belafonte then shared his longtime connection with the fund and told of one eye-opening trip he took to Africa in the early 80’s that forever impacted how he saw the world.“What struck me about that experience was not so much about the tragedy of the event itself but that there was a world that sat by with such indifference,” Belafonte said of witnessing the devastation of famine and drought. “When I came back to America, the thought constantly tugged at me...what could I do? I knew there was no way to fix the problem, but that didn’t motivate or justify doing nothing about the problem.”What Belafonte did when he returned to America was rally some of his celebrity friends to sing the iconic song, “We Are The World.” The album featuring the song went on to sell more than 20 million copies worldwide and raise around $60 million for health needs in Africa. The song, which was written by Michael Jackson and featured countless of other celebrity cameos, was performed by celebrities as part of a benefit concert for Belafonte’s USA For Africa campaign.It was through the USA For Africa campaign where Belafonte met public health activist Irwin Redlener, who, at the time, was a pediatrician who practiced in underserved communities around the globe. Redlener joined USA for Africa project as its medical director and helped to lead its health efforts abroad. “Most of the people who were part of [USA For Africa] were artists,” Belafonte said. “We had to reach out to other segments of this society to guide us in this effort.” Redlener and Belafonte returned to Africa together and visited various countries, clinics and camps to better understand the harsh health conditions people faced and do what they could to administer aid. Belafonte said it was an overwhelming experience for them both, and one that eventually prompted a pretty powerful revelation for Redlener. “It was a solemn moment,” Belafonte said. “But I could see that in Irwin Redlener, something was churning.”Belafonte described how Redlener was so moved by the trip that he expressed to him a need to “do something that will eternally be a declaration” of what they experienced in Africa. It was then that Redlener decided to launch of the Children’s Health Fund in 1987 as a way to provide healthcare to hundreds of thousands of kids in America who need it most. “This evening celebrated the outcome of that story and that journey… it’s an extension of the experiences that we’ve had,"" Belafonte said of Redlener. ""And that the reward, and my having to be here tonight, is because of [Redlener] and what his team has done.”"

At least, that would be our interpretation of his dismissive head shake, shoulder shrug and clear statement last month that the judge is just ""doing his job.""For his part, Trump doubled down in his attacks against Curiel, whom the soon-to-be Republican presidential nominee has racially profiled and branded as a ""hater"" and ""hostile"" in the ongoing case.“I’m building a wall. It’s an inherent conflict of interest” for Curiel, Trump said last week in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. It was his most deplorable comment yet about the judge, who is an American of Mexican descent. (Tuesday's non-apology doesn't help much.)But when asked about Curiel's performance on May 6 -- before Trump had singled out the judge as a whipping boy at his rallies -- the chief lawyer hired to defend the businessman was unequivocal in his response.“The judge is doing his job,” said Daniel Petrocelli, according to Yahoo! News. “We’re not seeking to recuse the judge,"" the very experienced trial attorney added.By law and under ethics rules, federal judges must step aside from cases where their impartiality might be reasonably questioned -- ""reasonably"" being the key concept here.But hardly anything Trump argues is reasonable. Trump's charge that Curiel has ""an absolute conflict"" in the case given his ethnic heritage has already drawn scorn from nearly every corner of the legal commentariat. Petrocelli's May 6 comments, which garnered no national attention at the time, should put a dagger through the spurious claim.More importantly, the lawyer's remarks suggest that he knows better than to pursue a frivolous recusal motion. As Reuters' Alison Frankel notes, a motion for recusal based on Trump's phony reasoning could cost Petrocelli and the rest of his legal team sanctions or other professional consequences that they couldn't easily shake off or appeal.“Courts have repeatedly held that matters such as race or ethnicity are improper bases for challenging a judge's impartiality,” wrote a federal appeals court in 1998. The two lawyers in that case got in trouble for seeking removal of a judge who they claimed was prejudiced because he is Asian American. Petrocelli surely knows this is a dangerous game, which may explain why in May, he brushed aside any notion of bias and zeroed in on the substance of Curiel's decision on when the Trump U. trial would take place.""I think the court today did a good job of trying to balance out the competing interests,"" the lawyer said. ""He made the decision. We would prefer to do a trial later in time. And he set it for November 28.""So the Trump U. trial is set for  after the presidential election -- when many hope that Trump will have returned to his day job of making deals and having to answer for them in courtrooms across the nation.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S. "

O'Reilly asked Trump if a Boston Globe report that he paid men working for his campaign a third more than women was true. “The answer is no,"" Trump responded. ""And I just had to check because I heard that this was going to be a question. I don’t know. I have a good source and somebody said that this could be a question.” (See video around 4:50.)During a January interview, Trump said O’Reilly had agreed in advance to not ask him about his decision to skip a Fox News Republican debate. O’Reilly said Trump was telling the truth about their conversation, but also that he’s “not going to listen to any political person tell me don’t ask me anything.”While ""The O'Reilly Factor"" has been largely friendly territory for Trump this election cycle, it would go beyond mere coziness to provide a presumptive presidential nominee with questions in advance of an interview. David Tabacoff, senior executive producer for ""The O'Reilly Factor,"" said in a statement that ""we never, ever tell the guests what questions will be asked.""""Bill O'Reilly is the only person who knows what exactly he'll ask,"" Tabacoff continued. ""We treated this interview like we treat all other guests on the program.""O'Reilly's question about the Globe report came after the Fox News host argued early in the broadcast that Judge Gonzalo Curiel should recuse himself from presiding over civil fraud lawsuits against Trump University given the controversy generated by Trump's baseless attack on the judge and possible perceptions of unfairness.Trump has said the Indiana-born Curiel cannot fairly judge the Trump University cases because he's of Mexican heritage, a blatantly racist argument that an American citizen's ethnicity should prevent him or her from doing their job. Washington Post media critic Erik Wemple wrote Tuesday that O'Reilly had followed Trump down the ""racist hellhole"" in calling for the judge's recusal.

19,POLITICS,Trump Surrogate Accuses Reporter Of 'Ambush Interview' For Asking About Judge Comments,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-judge_us_5756cb06e4b0ca5c7b4ffc4e,"He accuses NPR of picking on him to find ""the poison dart to kill Donald Trump.""",2016-06-07,Donald Trump has been taking heat from fellow Republicans for his comments about an Indiana-born judge who has Mexican-born parents.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5756cbce160000bc04f958a0.jpeg?ops=crop_10_138_5174_3101%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump may be doubling down on his controversial comments about a Mexican-American judge, but they're causing significant heartburn for even his strongest supporters who are having to answer for them.California state Sen. Joel Anderson (R) is a pledged delegate for Trump and went on NPR's ""Morning Edition"" Tuesday to talk about why the presumptive GOP nominee is so great. It was part of a segment about whether Trump and the GOP will have trouble with Latino voters. ""The press can say that he's a racist, they can do all the things that they want to do, but we're tired of being lied to by the press, and we think there's a better future for our children, and we're willing to fight for it,"" Anderson said. ""There's so much more going on than this nonsense about a judge. I mean, look, he deserves a fair trial like every American deserves a fair trial.""Anderson himself invoked Trump's comments about U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel; NPR host Renee Montagne did not specifically ask about them. But he then bristled when Montagne pressed him more on whether Trump's remarks were racist and accused her of conducting an ""ambush interview.""MONTAGNE: Certainly Donald Trump deserves a fair trial in this civil suit about Trump University. But Republican Party leaders, including Speaker Paul Ryan, including Senate leader Mitch McConnell, all pushed back on him for saying that a judge cannot be fair in a case because he is of Mexican descent. Or adding to that, a Muslim might not also be able to be fair if it involves Muslims. Is it not the definition of racism? Presuming their race or ethnicity or religion overrides everything.Curiel is in Trump’s crosshairs because he is handling two lawsuits against Trump University, the for-profit school that former employees have called a ""fraudulent scheme"" that “preyed upon the elderly and uneducated to separate them from their money.” Curiel recently ordered the release of embarrassing internal documents, which set off Trump’s anger. Trump said he believed the judge was ""Mexican"" and therefore unable to be impartial in the case because of the candidate's anti-immigrant rhetoric. Curiel was born in Indiana to parents who emigrated from Mexico.Montagne pressed Anderson more on Trump's comments, saying the GOP candidate seems to want people to take him at his word. Anderson again accused her of conducting an ambush interview and said she was picking on him. ""We've seen story after story from the beginning of ambush interviews looking for the poison dart to kill Donald Trump,"" he said. ""You haven't found any in the press, and now you're picking on a senator to try to find something. Look, I see him as an economic engine that's going to help everybody get back to work and be more prosperous.""Trump has put his supporters in a tough position, forced to choose between defending him or awkwardly distancing themselves from the man they're backing to be the next president. On Tuesday morning, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) said Trump's remarks were ""the textbook definition of a racist comment."" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said he “couldn’t disagree more"" with Trump's remarks but stopped short of calling them racism. Even former House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who desperately seems to want to be Trump's running mate, said the comments were ""inexcusable."" While some Trump campaign staffers have tried to tell surrogates to avoid talking about anything regarding Trump University, the candidate himself told his top surrogates to intensify criticism of both the judge and journalists. ""The people asking the questions -- those are the racists,"" Trump said in a conference call Monday. ""I would go at 'em.""Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
20,MEDIA,Politico Steps Up Search For New Editor,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/politico-editor-search_us_57558cafe4b0ed593f14e871,"Several prominent journalists have been considered for the influential role, as the 2016 conventions approach.",2016-06-07,"John Harris, Politico's co-founder, publisher, and editor-in-chief, is leading the company's search for a new editor.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5755c602160000bc04f957a1.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Politico's management is currently searching for the news organization's next editor and has signaled a desire to find a top candidate by early summer, ahead of the 2016 conventions, according to sources familiar with the matter.Co-founder John Harris, who serves as publisher and editor-in-chief, has told staffers he hopes to soon zero in on a successor to editor Susan Glasser, who had previously announced plans to take on a new role after the presidential election.Several journalists have so far been considered for the job, one of the most influential in coverage of politics and policy in Washington. Candidates have included Politico national editor Kristin Roberts, Politico Europe managing editor Carrie Budoff Brown, Bloomberg News' Washington managing editor (and former Politico managing editor) Craig Gordon, and Daily Beast executive editor Noah Shachtman, sources said. Gordon and Shachtman declined to comment. Management also approached former Politico reporter and current BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith early on in the search process, but Smith indicated he wasn't interested in returning, according to sources. Last month, Smith knocked down the rumors while guest-writing Politico's Playbook. A Politico spokesman acknowledged there’s been an ongoing editor search and said it ""continues with many tremendous candidates, both internally and externally.""Indeed, the next editor may not come from the list of names currently making the rounds in the newsroom, and presumably Harris has approached other contenders. Once he settles on a top candidate or two, Politico owner Robert Allbritton will make the final decision.Even after Allbritton signs off, there's expected to be a transition period, given that Glasser already has coverage plans in the works for the election. So despite plenty of newsroom buzz, it's unlikely a new editor will imminently take the reins. Harris, who steered coverage for most of Politico's nine-and-a-half-year existence, shifted in September 2014 to focus on the company's U.S. and European expansion efforts, as Glasser, then running Politico Magazine, began leading the newsroom.Politico announced in January that Glasser would be getting a new role after November, when she moves to Israel with her husband, Peter Baker, who begins this summer as The New York Times' Jerusalem bureau chief. The pair, who previously co-wrote a book while Moscow bureau chiefs at the Washington Post, are currently working on a biography of former Secretary of State James Baker. The announcement regarding Glasser's future with Politico came amid news of a larger company shake-up that included co-founder and CEO Jim VandeHei and star writer Mike Allen deciding to leave at the end of the year to start a new company.VandeHei wound up departing in April, and though Allen is still expected to remain through the presidential election, management has already been talking to possible successors to lead Playbook.

Relevant!But things get worse for Clinton. The data show that people want to know what Donald Trump calls her. They also ask what she weighs -- obviously a policy-related question frequently lobbed at male candidates, right?In California, where a primary is happening Tuesday, Googlers ask how old Clinton is and whether she plans to drop out of the election. (She has secured enough delegates to clinch the nomination, the Associated Press reported Monday, so that's probably not happening.)Beyond the SNL question, people want to know if Sanders is rich and whether he's still running for office. (Ouch.) In California, they ask if he's a vegan.Google data is an interesting way to get a candid look at what people are wondering. Think about how you use the search engine: Perhaps you've Googled a medical symptom you were too embarrassed to ask someone about? Or maybe you've double-checked some gossip on a celebrity.

He has been dogged about sales tactics at Trump University, with greater scrutiny as the general election has approached.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5756b801130000a109383c89.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Among psychologists there is a fairly well-known Polish study that looked at the persuasive power of fear. In it, researchers placed fake parking tickets on car windshields. On other cars, they put advertisements that looked like parking tickets. And on other cars, they put the same advertisements on the doors rather than on the windshields. After the drivers found and inspected the ticket or advertisement, the researchers went up to them and asked a favor. The idea was to measure the levels of receptivity to that favor among the anxious (those who received tickets), the relieved (those who received a ticket that turned out to be an ad), and the unaffected (those who received ads on their doors). The results, as described in Maria Konnikova's book The Confidence Game, were what you might expect:The single most persuadable type of driver: the one who had just experienced a wave of relief following anxiety. The second: the one who'd experienced only anxiety. The least: the one who'd felt nothing. The authors concluded that the emotional drain of anxiety followed by the wave of emotional relief created a state of relative mindlessness.I was reminded of this study as I rummaged through 400 pages of documents released in a case brought against Trump University, Donald Trump's for-profit institution which has been widely criticized as a “fraudulent scheme."" The documents show it had little resemblance to an educational opportunity for those looking to master the real estate market. More precisely, Trump U appears to have been an ATM machine for its titular leader -- a series of seminars held in hotel ballrooms that offered get-rich-fast potions to attendees.Trump U, accused of having “preyed upon the elderly and uneducated to separate them from their money,"" may not technically have been a con job, but the persuasive techniques used by its agents share many qualities with those used by con artists. They're certainly recognizable in the pages of Konnikova's exhaustive work.Playing on the same emotions examined in that Polish experiment, Trump U officials made use of people's anxiety and relief. In one document, for example, officials were told to be ""very aggressive"" in conversations with prospective students ""in order to push them out of their comfort zone."" Yes, the playbook noted, these people may be scared off by the cost of the course, which could be as high as $34,995. But they'd quickly be relieved to know the riches on the other end.If they complain about the prices, remind them that Trump is the BEST!!! This is the last real estate investment they will ever need to make!! Remind them that TU teams are only looking for those students who qualify and have a positive attitude. We are the best of the best. At the end of the session, use positive reinforcement in order to calm their fears.This is Persuasion 101. As Konnikova writes in her book, cons excel at creating ""a sense of fear, and then the feeling of relief (not to worry! There's a solution!)."" But the con, or sale, starts well before fear is induced and relief subsequently offered. It begins at the moment a person steps in the door. Indeed, con artists are expert at making their marks feel as if they know them personally. ""In one series of experiments,"" Konnikova writes, ""people were more likely to buy something from a relative stranger if that relative stranger happened to recall their name. They viewed the mere recall as a compliment; clearly they were important enough to note, and if that person thought so, then it was a very discerning person indeed."" Trump U officials placed a heavy emphasis on familiarity. The guidance encouraged agents to introduce themselves and establish a rapport, to shake hands and make eye contact, even to ""congratulate"" attendees for being there. In one playbook, organizers were told: Collect personalized information that you can utilize during closing time. (For example: are they a single parent of three children that may need money for food? Or are they a middle-aged commuter that is tired of traveling for 2 hours to work each day?)But good cons don't layer it on too thick. They give their marks a sense of empowerment, too. Konnikova notes that fraud victims often don't question the legitimacy of the reward they're being offered, let alone the person who offers it. They believe that they're ""dealing with someone to be reckoned with (legitimate power), and that someone is in a position to reward you, be it financially or otherwise."" The Trump U playbook instructed officials to provide attendees with that sense of empowerment and to make them believe that that ballroom session was the simple, missing key to life's riches. If you're like most people, you spend most of your time just trying to keep your head above water, waiting for life to get easier. But if you don't put your dreams into action, no one's going to do it for you! You just need someone to show you how to get started.Finally, con artists rely on trust. And often the best way to establish trust is through a respected figure: a community member, a well-dressed financier, a religious leader. ""Someone like you,"" Konnikova writes, ""Someone you would like to become.""For Trump U, the trusted figure's name is right there on the sign. Though he admitted in a deposition that he had minimal involvement in picking the instructors or curriculum at his ""university,"" Trump clearly served the function of the proverbial rope. Attendees were promised ""Trump style"" success, a Trump mentor, and, quite literally, ""every single resource"" that Trump himself ""has at his disposal."" ""You will see that when you're in the Trump family, you have absolutely nothing to fear!"" read one playbook.Once con artists gain some familiarity and establish a rapport, they prefer to move swiftly. People tend to make big decisions quickly, often unconsciously, Konnikova writes. And if you apply pressure in that moment, they are all the more vulnerable.In the Trump U documents, timeliness and pressure are constant themes for salesmen. They're encouraged, for example, to interrupt prospective students if they start expressing more than one concern or ask for more time. Does Tiger Woods say 'let me win a few tournaments first and then I'll hire swing coaches?'An entire bullet point in one playbook outlines how to convince someone not to bring his or her concerns home to their spouse. I have been doing this for a long time, and the only thing your wife will say at the end of Friday is, 'why did you wait so long to get this training, I can't believe how much money we've missed out on in our own backyard! We have a lot of catching up to do!!'The mention of money also serves as a powerfully persuasive tool. It may seem obvious, but its psychological impact can't be underestimated. Studies at the University of Minnesota, for example, have shown it tends to distract people. Trump U instructors found it to be useful bait. ""Put your million dollar check on your mirror, look at it every day, and believe you will cash it! Stay positive!'"" read the playbook.Of course, Trump U was geared as much -- probably more -- toward separating people from their money than fulfilling the vision of the million-dollar check. Officials went to great lengths to achieve that separation. ""Students"" were encouraged to go into credit card debt or to borrow from retirement plans. ABC News reported that Trump U ""advised students to try to boost their credit card limit by inflating their annual income by $75,000."" In the playbooks, Trump U officials were advised to get prospective clients to show them their credit card statements to see if they could find ways to help them save money on interest payments -- money that could then be used to pay for the seminars. ""Again,"" the playbook reads, ""we are trying to build a mental picture of what will happen to give them confidence in spending the money."" In the end, Trump U proved modestly successful in its mission. As the Washington Post reported, during its four years of operation ""more than 80,300 people attended the free introductory sessions"" but ""only around 6,000 people paid between $995 and $1,995 to attend three-day seminars"" and just ""572 people paid the full $34,995 for the top-level Trump University mentorship."" Attendees subsequently accused the university of being a racket designed to prey on their vulnerabilities. Even instructors conceded that the goal wasn't to educate but to convince people to pay for the most expensive products. Trump has gone to great lengths to defend the enterprise, not just questioning whether an American judge of Mexican heritage can impartially oversee a lawsuit on the case, but also trotting out former students to attest to just how valuable the experience was. But this also has its parallels to cons. Konnikova explains that even marks who are presented with evidence they've been duped will give a post-facto rationalization for how and why it happened. Some refuse to admit that a con took place at all. ""It's a kind of confirmation in reverse,"" she explains. ""[W]e marshal evidence that makes our decision seem well reasoned even when we didn't actually use any of that evidence in reaching our choice to begin with.""Trump U may have given some attendees the experience, insight and connections to understand the real estate market and make money off of it. But that doesn't mean it didn't use predatory psychological techniques to persuade vulnerable individuals to part with their money. "
23,POLITICS,Message To Donald Trump: We're All In With Mexico,Howard Fineman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/huffpost-mexico-launch_us_5756d39be4b07823f9513e98,"HuffPost is launching a Mexican edition, because our neighbor is crucial to us and the world, especially in the time of a would-be caudillo named Trump.",2016-06-07,Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump speaks at a campaign rally on June 3. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- As they say in the law, here is the question in the case: Can a 62-year-old son of Mexican immigrants who was born and educated in the United States preside fairly as a judge in a suit involving Donald J. Trump? Anyone who knows U.S. District Judge Gonzalo P. Curiel -- not to mention the U.S. Constitution and the rules and precedents of the courts -- knows that the distinguished graduate of Indiana University and its law school can do just that.In the U.S., a judge is a judge regardless of the racial or ethnic makeup of anyone involved in the case. It is the essence of what we stand for as a country. But Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, insists -- in stubborn defiance of his party and his own campaign staff -- that Curiel’s “Mexican heritage” makes him hopelessly biased. He has doubled down on the attack in the last week.Even loyalists Republicans have correctly dismissed Trump’s remarks as “racist.”Trump’s stand (which is, in reality, a move to protect his shoddy business “reputation”) is yet another attack on Mexicans, Mexican-Americans and Mexican immigrants by a man who ate a taco bowl for lunch as a snarky rebuke to his critics.It also shows the urgent need for The Huffington Post to act in the only way we know how: by doing more and better journalism.Today we announced a full-scale, Spanish-language edition based in and reporting on Mexico: its politics, culture, lifestyle and increasingly crucial relationship with its giant neighbor to the north and the world as a whole. HuffPost Mexico will be published in conjunction with Mexico City-based Grupo Imagen Multimedia, a major digital player. It will be HuffPost’s 16th edition around the world, and will serve the largest Spanish-speaking country on Earth. We hope that by sharing reporting in Mexico with the world -- and vice versa --we can counter taunts with understanding. Reporters, videographers, photographers, researchers and the rest of the media can’t forge peace, abolish injustice or elevate wise leaders. But good journalism explodes stereotypes, dispels destructive myths and gives us all access to accurate representations of our fellow humans -- not as their enemies, rulers, propagandists or demagogues depict them. And it can explain, in Mexico and in the U.S., why respect for laws and constitutions shout “no” to racist taunts aimed at judges, especially when those taunts come from someone who would be sworn to uphold both. The rise of Trump is a special challenge for both the U.S. and Mexico, and to our often contentious, centuries-old relationship. Trump rocketed to the top of the GOP primarily on anti-Mexican provocation: calling Mexican immigrants rapists, drug dealers and criminals; vowing to build a wall between the two countries; proposing to summarily deport 11 million undocumented immigrants, most of whom are from Mexico; claiming that trade deals have benefited only Mexico. Trump ensures that Mexico will be at the center of the U.S. presidential campaign -- and that the U.S. campaign will be at the center of Mexico’s own politics and foreign policy. But there are, of course, other crucial reasons for launching a Mexico edition now. Our two countries are increasingly intertwined, whatever Trump may wish to unravel. We must report from and to both sides of a border that joins as much as it separates. More than 1 in 10 Americans are of Mexican descent. In percentage terms, there are more immigrants in the U.S. now than at any time in more than a century -- and many more of them are from Mexico than from any other country. This year, more than 1 in 6 eligible voters in the U.S. are Hispanic and, again, the largest share are of Mexican background. Mexico is the United States’ third largest trading partner, after Canada and China. And despite what Trump claims, the U.S. is by far the net beneficiary in dollar terms, since many of the goods “imported” from Mexico contain parts that were manufactured in the U.S.Our growing commonalities encourage people in the U.S. to see our own history in a more textured way. More of us now know that the oldest government building in the country is in Santa Fe, not Boston, and that the most Texan of all monuments, the Alamo, was a Mexican fort in Spanish America. The “American pastime” is baseball -- and nearly 1 in 5 players in the Major Leagues is Hispanic.Of course there are common concerns far less sunny than beisbol, chief among them the northern flow of drugs, and what it is doing not only to the U.S. but to the stability of Mexico. The U.S. and Mexico -- and the world -- need to know a specific piece of Mexican history, and the role it plays today: the idea of the ""caudillo.""Caudillos were rich landowners who paid their own militias and ruled their turf with iron fists and claims of populist concern for the people. The system mostly benefited the boss at the expense of the poor farmers, villagers and soldiers who were made to serve him. Mexican reformers fought to rid the country of the caudillos. They did so, only to see the drug lords take their place. But the old idea of the caudillo lives on in the Manhattan, of all places. In Trump Tower.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article stated that Curiel is 53 years old.
