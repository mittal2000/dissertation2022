Fashion-wise you saw dresses, bling, some awesome blazers, dazzling customizations and, of course, tons of great jewelry and accessories. Here's the style-rundown for Top 7 American Idol, and don't forget to hit me up on Twitter: @SoysFashion!Hollie CavanaghI wanted Hollie to be perfect this week. The judges and Jimmy have been so hard on her, so I wanted to soften her up with this quaint frock. I love her giant diamond ring bracelet; I wanted America to fall in love again with this sweetheart.(Left) For Hollie's performance of Pink's ""Perfect,"" I styled her in a white Jovani dress and Steve Madden shoes. (Jennifer Lopez admired, ""You look beautiful tonight, Hollie."") The look was topped off with Bebe earrings and a bracelet from Prb Studios, Private Collection. (Right) For her trio performance with Joshua and Jessica, Hollie wore a Bebe top and shoes, ANGL bandeau, and Notify pants from LIVE! On Sunset. Jewelry included Bebe earrings and Glitterrings ring.Colton DixonI had a lot of fun customizing Colton's look this week. Did you know Colton's jacket stewed in a dye pot for five hours before I got that final color? And!!! I had his duet shirt studded for the show and they began popping off ten minutes before he had to perform live. Somehow we managed to get them back on in the nick of time!(Left) To sing ""I Love the Way You Lie"" by Skylar Grey, Colton wore an H&M t-shirt, Tuesday Night Band Practice hoodie, and a Lip Service jacket with Kizmit customizations. (Randy Jackson said to Steven Tyler ""that's a hot jacket."") He wore Hudson shoes, a Saint Vintage necklace and bracelet, and GodDaughters ring. (Right) For his duet with Skylar, Colton wore a top by INC International Concepts, pants by Robin's Jean, and Hudson shoes. His bracelet was by Pennyroyal Studio.Skylar LaineAfter last week's dress for ""Wind Beneath My Wings,"" Skylar and I discovered a new style wing beneath her wings -- dresses! She has a tiny waist and I love showing that off and so does she! She looked so beautiful in both her curve-showing dresses.(Left) To sing Kellie Picker's ""Didn't You Know How Much I Loved You,"" I styled Skylar in a feminine Mackage dress with a sweetheart neckline and Pelle Moda shoes. Jewelry included Bebe earrings, a Pennyroyal Studio necklace, and Devora Libin Jewels bracelets. (Right) For her duet with Colton, Skylar wore a Haute Hippie dress and Jeffrey Campbell shoes. Her jewelry included earrings and necklace by Angel Court and rings by RichRocks.Joshua LedetYou don't need to spend a ton of cash to look smart and stylish like Joshua. You can put together a great look with pops of color and a pair of nice fitted pants. I love the whole retro style for Joshua. He's so bold, and if any one could pull off the pink it was him! Joshua's other signature style is his funky socks; it's a fun hidden secret that you can get a glimpse of when he performs!(Left) I styled Joshua in an Express button-up top very similar to this, Moods of Norway jacket, and Mezlan shoes with Kizmit customizations (bling!) for his performance of Bruno Mars' quick song ""Runaway."" Jewelry included a Swarovski necklace and personal ring. (Right) For his trio performance with Hollie and Jessica, he wore Zara button-up top and pants, Calvin Klein vest, and custom shoes. Jewelry included a Swarovski necklace and personal ring.Phillip PhillipsI love the simple clean looks I'm coming up with for Phillip. He doesn't need much to be hot on stage! I'm sure all you Phillip fans would agree that he looks hot in a simple v-neck and blazer! His jeans were nicely fitted once again this week, and his woven leather guitar strap is such a great way to style him in a natural way.(Left) To sing Maroon 5's ""Give a Little More,"" Phillip wore a v-neck Gap shirt with a Kenneth Cole blazer and Lucky Brand pants. His shoes were by The Frye Company and he wore a Red Monkey guitar strap like he did last week. (Right) For his duet with Elise, Phil wore a Gap shirt, Banana Republic button-up top, and Citizens of Humanity pants. His shoes were by To Boot New York by Adam Derrick.Jessica SanchezThis girl does have good taste, like JLo commented. I have so much fun with Jessica week after week. She is really openminded when it comes to fashion. With her physique and the way she carries herself she can pull off a lot of couture looks. But let's not forget she's sixteen! Even with the elaborate styles, my main goal is to keep her looking young!(Left) To sing Jazmine Sullivan's ""Stuttering,"" Jessica wore a glimmering, short, short Jad Ghandour dress, David Lerner leggings, and Christian Louboutin platform shoes. I styled her in jewelry including Rodrigo Otazu earrings and RichRocks rings and bracelet. (Right) For her trio performance with Joshua and Hollie, Miss Jessica wore a top by Bless'ed Are the Meek, Camilla and Marc tights, and Bebe shoes and earrings. Other jewelry included a necklace by Prb Studios, Private Collection, Neon Dirt and Devora Libin Jewels bracelets, and a RichRocks ring.Elise TestoneThere never is enough time on American Idol to style the contestants, and this week was a whirlwind with Elise. On the night of the show I decided to keep Elise simple next to Phillip by taking off her fringe vest. This allowed her to show off her curves (which I love) and to complement the duet. For her solo we were backstage sewing up the train of her skirt so that she could feel comfortable sitting and standing to and from the piano. It was a rough night, but she looked and sang fabulous!(Left) For Elise's performance of ""You and I"" by Lady Gaga, I styled her in a Bebe top, Hale Bob skirt with a custom Kizmit outer layer and her own shoes. Jewelry included Dreaming Tree Designs by Sarah Poe earrings, Gypsy Global necklace, Energy Muse bracelet, and Prb Studios, Private Collection ring. (Right) For her duet with Phillip, Elise wore a BP. Apparel tank, Bebe sheer top, skirt, and shoes, and True Religion vest. Her necklace was by J. Crew, and she wore an Energy Muse bracelet."

A must-have this spring/summer is a fitted belt. This one accessory can really pull together any outfit, whether going out on the town or staying casual during a hot afternoon.Sometimes, a nude top can completely wash out a redhead; but with a rockin' colorful, ""redhead friendly"" belt, you're sure to have a great outfit.Growing up, I always thought I had to buy new clothes once spring sprung and I would completely forget about the clothes I purchased from last year. I would find myself saying, ""I have nothing to wear!"" also known as a fashion-lover's worst nightmare. I eventually learned what the power of a belt can do and it is now a must-needed accessory that I always recommend to my redheaded ladies. Some fashion tips on how to rock a belt this season and learn how to compliment your red hair:1. Keep It Simple: If you are not in the mood to wear jewelry and want to keep it simple, go for a belt to loop around those fitted jeans or colorful summer shorts.2. Layer: Layer together a small and large belt. Just make sure both compliment each other; just like Adrienne and I in the above picture!3. Get Creative: Tie the belt in the back instead of the front.4. Get Really Creative:  Add studs to a simple leather belt.5. Use Other Closet Items: Make a thick piece of fabric look like a belt. Crisscross the fabric and tie it in a big bow for a flirty, summer look6. Skip It: Have fun with skipping loops or not using them at all.My top five favorite ""redhead friendly"" belts for spring/summer:1. A brown double wrap belt looks great with a neutral dress. MM6 Maison Martin Margiela new wrap belts are beautiful and fun.2. A corset leather belt with a high wasted pencil skirt is a fabulous way to spice up a work outfit. Diane von Furstenberg is a great choice.3. A wide belt is so versatile. Loving Alice + Olivia's spring wide belts in red (of course).4. Bright skinny belts are a must-have. Rag & Bone and Linear Pelle are two of my favorites.5. Looking to rock a preppy look? Braided rope belts look stunning with an opened cardigan. You can make this yourself by simply purchasing a rope and tying it around your waist.My ultimate redhead tip: Experiment with your style to find your favorite belts. Don't forget that fashion is suppose to be fun and represent who you are!It's now time to buckle up and get ready for the warm months ahead, redhead-style! Image courtesy of How to be a Redhead!

6,TRAVEL,"Catching Trout In Branson, Missouri's Fishing Hole","Margie Goldsmith, Contributor
Has traveled to 130 countries and written about them all",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/catching-trout-in-an-amer_us_5b9b94d8e4b03a1dcc78cce5,"These fish are wary and need to be stalked with patience, something I lack. Even your shadow on the water warns them away.",2012-04-18,2012-04-17-FishingGuidenetsAuthorsRainbowTrout.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-04-17-FishingGuidenetsAuthorsRainbowTrout.png,"I feel a tug on my line. ""It's a brown!"" says Darin Schildknect, the fishing guide whom I've hired on Lake Taneycomo, which runs through the heart of Branson, Missouri. ""Reel it in."" Too late. It's gone. ""What did I do wrong?"" I ask him.""You have to set the hook. Jerk it up and reel it in. too bad, that was a nice brown."" I don't know what a ""brown"" is. Catfish? Trout? Barracuda?  Branson Fisherman with a 25-pound Brown (Photo Courtesy of Lilley's Landing)I've come to Branson the Music Capital of the World, to pig out on Broadway-caliber shows. In two days I've already seen six, my favorite was It, in which the five Hughes family brothers, their wives and all their talented children dance, play instruments and sing country, Broadway, rock n' roll and gospel. But now I need an outside break from all those theatres. Branson is an outdoor lover's paradise, so I can hike, bike, zipline, play golf or miniature golf, go-cart, ride an amphibious Duck, splash around in an outdoor water park, and a lot more.I choose fishing, because Lake Taneycomo is one of the best trout fisheries in the Midwest, considered one of the fishing hotspots in North America. I want to redeem myself from my one fishing experience in a stream in Colorado, when I slipped on a rock and couldn't get up because my waders were water-clogged. (The fly fishing guide was able to help me to dry land). But this would be boat fishing --no waders or slippery rocks, no fly fishing and having to try and cast like Brad Pitt in a River Runs Through It. Lilley's Landing, just five minutes from the center of Branson, offers half and full-day guided fishing tours. The brochure made it sound easy: ""Four main ingredients are needed for a successful trout fishing trip: a 2-4 pound line, a good ultra-light rod and reel, small weights, hooks or lures; and patience and a sensitive touch. Trout typically don't strike hard. They tend to pick at their food like a little kid eating spinach. I've witnessed rainbows taking a piece of worm in their mouths only to blow them out. Or they will take the tip of the worm and shake their head violently, tearing it off the hook. Are they smart? It seems so. But don't give them too much credit. Generally they are easy to catch.""Easy to catch? Maybe easy for Darin, whose record is a 26-pound brown, but I don't have the touch he does.""Let's try this,"" he says. He removes the long Rapela lure from my line and replaces it with a red and a yellow bead. ""Eggs,"" he says.""Huh?"" We call them eggs because they imitate salmon's eggs. It's Power bait, "" he hands me back my line.As the boat drifts, my line bumps along the bottom until I suddenly feel something heavy. This time I jerk up the line and reel fast. It feels as though my first fish is heavier than the 37-inch long 28.8-pound record-breaking brown. I reel fast, faster...and pull up a rock, to which is an attached lure and a lot of line. Darin is encouraging. ""It happens,"" he says.I cast the line again. And again. Nothing. I'm already bored. How will I last four hours? I should have gone to another show. I ask Darin, ""What do you like about fishing?"" ""I like being outside and not worrying about what time it is and thinking about nothing,"" he says.  Suddenly, I feel something pull on my line. This time, I pull up on the rod and reel as fast as I can.""You've got him,"" Darin says as he reaches for the net. I keep reeling and reeling until I finally spot a rainbow trout thrashing just beneath the surface. Darin scoops him into the net.  Fishing Guide Scoops Author's Rainbow Trout into a NetI hand over my camera and try to hold the trout, but it slithers right out of my hands. Darin sticks his finger down the fish's mouth. ""Hold him like this and he won't squirm."" I slide my finger to his mouth, but feel the sharp teeth. I don't want to be bitten, so I hold the writhing fish with both hands for a second and then hand it to Darin. Darin takes the hook out of the fish's mouth. ""Want to keep it?"" I shake my head no and he throws the trout back into the water. I could easily cook as I'm staying at The Majestic Condos with a full kitchen, but this is a vacation and tonight I'm eating at Andy Williams' Moon River Grill. A boat with two fishermen motors towards us. ""How many ya got?"" calls one of the men.""We got a couple,"" Darin says.""Why'd you say that?"" I ask when they're out of earshot.He grins. ""That's part of being a fisherman."" During the next hour, I catch three more rainbows but after that, not another nibble. It doesn't matter. I'm happy watching the blue herons which are everywhere: either perched on the shore or flying right above us. I look out at the leafy green trees along the shore and listen to the water lap against the boat.  Lake Taneycomo, Branson, MissouriI think about the Brown that got away. These fish are wary and need to be stalked with patience, something I lack. Even your shadow on the water warns them away. But that Brown doesn't matter because I'm re-living the thrill I experienced each time I hooked the other four fish and reeled them in. I'm thinking about the 28.8-pound trophy Brown that broke the record, secretly wondering if I could ever top that."
