What have we learned in a decade of emergent debate on the topic? What are the effects of a topic nobody, be it policy makers, professors, students, or parents, can avoid touching upon one way or another?A decade ago the topic was eclectically discussed, infusing small circles of dispersed professional communities such as development experts, nonprofit managers, and small elites of foundation visionaries and its beneficiaries. Today professional communities, career trajectories, and financial and political resources navigate around the topic.Social entrepreneurship diffused through a multiplicity of linguistic labels. Definitional roundtables in community gatherings, business school classrooms, grantee evaluations, youth clubs, and even venture capital board roams became spaces to discuss viewpoints on society and entrepreneurship. Its ambiguous multiplicity served as a neutral and optimistic bandwagon for the many lucky, working or wanting to work in the 'industry' of social innovation, to justify their actions.The innocence of social entrepreneurship, however, is over. How and where will and should these discussions take place in a decade or so in the future? The concept needs a reflective debate on its political causes and effects by focusing on the little, more complex stories that are, in our opinion, at the heart of social entrepreneurship, illustrating the inherent tensions that come to the fore in the practical reality of changing the social. To survive, the social entrepreneurship 'movement' needs to prove its reflective capacity and work on the political implications inherent in what it proclaims -- to be the 21st century engine of societal change.Those most affected by its signaling is the next generation. We grow up to become uncynical, myopic followers of an idealistic type of neoliberal dogma that drives how we engage with the social and, even more important, with ourselves and personal life and career trajectories.The concept's survival lies in its strength by those who practice, preach, and diffuse the concept in praxis, for years by now, and thus skeptical about its hegemonic forces through its grand, often times superficial, but nevertheless enrolling narrative."

A regulated market economy based on free price formation has its serious shortcomings but has long been the best we got. Now, a superior alternative seems to come quickly within reach: a market economy, for sure, but one based on true prices. The true price of a product is its quoted price plus the unpaid -- ""external"" -- environmental and social costs incurred in its production and consumption.Just imagine what happens when in a few years' time all producers would provide transparency with regard to their true prices. In so doing, they would give consumers the benefit to take these true prices into consideration next to the actual prices. For instance, when shopping for a smartphone, you could see and come to realize the costs of restoring the harm done by your individual phone due to amongst others CO emissions, mineral depletion and possible underpayment of workers. If actual price differences are small, then you could opt to buy the phone with the most competitive true price. And many others could do so as well. All these individual choices would result in a terrific world. Progressive brands could set themselves positively apart by sporting products with low true prices, and no brand would like to have a reputation of high true prices. This creates competition -- the driving force in capitalism -- on sustainability, so that companies will start to find effective ways to avoid unpaid costs. And by keeping the environmental and social costs at bay, we conserve the planet for ourselves and our children, and allow people to have a decent job and life. Far-fetched? You believe that these ideas come from dreamy greenies? Well, think again. Progressive companies are the ones setting the trend towards providing transparency about the external costs incurred in production and consumption. Pavan Sukhdev, a former banker at Deutsche Bank, led an influential UNEP study to value ecosystems and biodiversity (The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity) starting 2008. Yvon Chouinard and Rick Ridgeway from outdoor clothing company Patagonia called for companies to monetize their externalities in the Harvard Business Review in 2011 (together with Jib Ellison). In that same year, sportswear brand Puma published the first environmental profit & loss (EP&L) account ever, showing how much costs Puma imposed on the planet. The so-called B-team, headed by Jochen Zeitz, former Puma CEO, and Richard Branson, founder of Virgin, want to take it one step further and will launch this year a coalition of companies to scale up the ""EP&L."" In sum, visionary business leaders are shaping this trend right now. The critical question is how we can realize that companies not only show but actually improve their impact on society. At present only a fraction of all external costs can be internalized profitably. Hence, companies need their consumers to prefer products and brands with low external costs over those with high external costs. Otherwise the efforts of Branson and others towards monetizing externalities will probably remain an interesting intellectual exercise at the corporate level. It is therefore essential to create mainstream markets for products with competitive true prices. This requires progressive companies to go beyond corporate-level transparency such as an EP&L and involve their consumers in this evolving trend by showing the true prices of their products. For now, keep an eye on the World Economic Forum meeting at Davos these days (January 23-27), where monetizing externalities is a hot topic. The buzz will undoubtedly accelerate the inevitable evolution of capitalism.This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post and The World Economic Forum in recognition of the latter's Global Shapers initiative.

Shumlin seriously think Vermonters are going to spend more money simply because they have another place to buy Chinese-made underwear? Cutting the retail pie thinner does not create net new jobs.,2013-01-27,"Gov. Peter Shumlin holds a news conference following the Supreme Court decision on Obamacare on Thursday, June 28, 2012 in Montpelier, Vt. Shumlin has been saying the state would push ahead no matter how Thursday's ruling from the Supreme Court turned out. But the law remaining in place is expected to mean Vermont's health overhaul will be helped by up to $400 million a year in federal tax credits and other subsidies.(AP Photo/Toby Talbot)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2e61d240000300097325e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Environmentalists in New England were stunned recently when Vermont Governor Peter Shumlin publicly embraced a proposed Wal-Mart superstore as ""good news"" for his state.Shumlin joins ranks with former Vermont Governor, Republican Jim Douglas, who stumped at a pro Wal-Mart rally in St. Albans, Vermont in January of 2010 -- cheerleading for the same developer who now has Governor Shumlin at his side.  This is the same Shumlin who has called for the shut-down of an aging nuclear power plant in southern Vermont, and described the power plant's owner, Entergy, as ""not trustworthy."" This is the same Shumlin whose website lists ""energy and the environment"" as one of his top six priorities. This is the same Shumlin who in 2010 opposed a Wal-Mart store near the Wilderness civil war battlefield in Virginia, where 1,200 Vermont soldiers died in 1864. ""Our brave soldiers gave their lives to keep the country together, and end slavery,"" Shumlin said. ""It would have been an awful loss to have that battlefield covered in the shadow of a Wal-Mart store.""Apparently the shadow of a Wal-Mart store across his own state is not a problem for Shumlin. On January 17, 2013, Democratic Governor Shumlin was featured on Wal-Mart New England's website:The Walmart Corporation has signed a lease with developer Jeff Davis of Burlington to build Vermont's first Walmart Supercenter on Route 5 in Derby. Sunlight broke through morning clouds Tuesday, as Davis welcomed Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin...to the location of the proposed Walmart Supercenter...'This is an example of how we create jobs in the Kingdom,' Shumlin said to applause.Derby Center Village had roughly 619 people in 2010. Its surrounding trade area is less than 5,000 people. The community has lost 12 percent of its population since 1990. It's a very small community in Orleans County on the northern edge of Vermont's Northeast Kingdom, which economic planners have described as ""a region that truly has a sense of place."" Planners say two of the Northeast Kingdom's ""critical problems"" are a ""lack of adequate income"" and ""absence of sufficient high skill jobs."" When it comes to big box sprawl, Shumlin apparently has a blind spot the size of a superstore parking lot. Shumlin is backing the same developer who has two Vermont Wal-Marts under his belt already -- both of them bitterly fought -- and is aiming now to build another one in the Northeast Kingdom.Shumlin was quoted by the Associated Press as boasting that developer Jeff Davis' Wal-Mart plan was ""good news"" for this high unemployment region, and he's hopeful the Wal-Mart won't be greeted with a lot of opposition. But the Governor went even further. He said the Wal-Mart would bring 300 jobs and had ""huge support"" in Derby and surrounding towns.In response, a spokesperson for the Vermont Natural Resources Council, which has done much of the legal work over the years to slow Wal-Mart down, said the developer's proposal was the wrong scale in the wrong place. The VNRC issued a statement saying: We're especially disappointed to see the Governor supporting big box sprawl. We are very concerned that this development -- which is the wrong scale in the wrong place -- will undermine Newport City, one of the many downtowns that the State and so many others have been working hard to revitalize.Residents in the city and town of St. Albans, Vt., who fought off several developers, including Jeff Davis, for nearly 20 years, have offered to help Derby defeat Vermont's first 145,000 square foot superstore. Opponents in St. Albans lost their epic battle in 2011 to protect a tract of farmland from Wal-Mart.No construction on the St. Albans store has begun yet, but opponents say the new store will only detract from existing jobs, something Governor Shumlin apparently never learned. Shumlin critics also charge that the Governor has used his appointment powers to stack the deck with pro-big box commissioners on regional Environmental Review Boards. According to anti-Wal-Mart activist Sue Prent of St. Albans, ""Governor Shumlin is making precisely the same statements about Walmart coming to Derby that [Gov.]Jim Douglas made a decade ago about St. Albans. To this seasoned veteran of the Wal-Mart wars, Peter Shumlin might as well be a Republican... now he endorses the 'Walmartification' of Vermont.""In an article for the Green Mountain Daily, Prent added: The Governor has disappointed me a-plenty over the past couple of years, but never more so than when he endorsed the completely false premise that Wal-Mart means local prosperity. He's 'hopeful it won't be greeted with lots of opposition' and hints darkly at 'forces outside the [Northeast] Kingdom' which he fears might get involved. I'm hopeful that there will be plenty of opposition; and as someone 'outside the Kingdom' I will welcome the opportunity to share all that we in the Northwest Citizens For Responsible Growth have learned throughout the past decade about how Wal-Mart impacts communities and how Mr. Davis works his way through the permit processes.Prent notes that when Shumlin ""had barely assumed office, aided in no small part by the efforts of progressive minded folks like myself who abhor the exploitation of Wal-Mart, the Governor made it clear that his loyalty is to the monied class of developers and pocket-padders."" Brushing aside our objections, he reappointed as [environmental board] commissioner, a man whose family business has recently re-located from downtown St. Albans City to Exit 20, so as to take advantage of the Wal-Mart and other potential development out there; all of which has been and will be under review by that commissioner. Not surprisingly, Davis' Wal-Mart slipped through Act 250 [environmental review process] like butter.It must have taken some tortured logic for progressive Governor Shumlin to backslap one of the worst environmental corporate actors in America. There is green in Vermont's Green Mountains -- but not the kind that environmentalists and tourists flock to see. Numerous economic studies, including reviews done in Vermont as far back as 1993 (Williston) show that Wal-Mart is a form of economic cannibalism, that ""captures"" sales from local and regional retailers.So where are the 300 jobs going to come from? Does Shumlin seriously think Vermonters are going to spend more money simply because they have another place to buy Chinese-made underwear? Cutting the retail pie thinner does not create net new jobs. If economic dislocation is 'good news' to Shumlin, what about the enormously wasteful land consumption associated with big box development, and the traffic congestion? Vermont's existing land use patterns are antithetical to sprawl. How odd that Shumlin is fighting corporate power at Vermont Yankee, yet shilling for Wal-Mart. Vermont has the lowest number of Wal-Marts per capita of any state in the nation. For economic and environmental reasons, Governor Shumlin should consider Wal-Mart as the retail equivalent of a nuclear power plant. A superstore in Derby would cast a shadow over the entire Northeast Kingdom, and cement Shumlin's image as the Governor of Sprawl. Activist and author Al Norman has written 3 books about Wal-Mart. His most recent book is Occupy Walmart. He is the founder of Sprawl-Busters, and has been helping communities fight big box sprawl for two decades.  "

Sixty-five percent of the city's population of 4  million lives in the highly marginalized densely populated slums  of the city, where residents face conditions of considerable insecurity  and indignity characterized by single 10' x 10' shacks made of galvanized  sheets, wood, polythene, wattle or mud with little access to clean water,  sanitation, health care, schools and other essential public services. The  poor who live in these fragile areas are at the mercy of environmental  vagaries, especially ﬂooding. Overcrowding raises the risk of respiratory  illness. Contaminated water supply and unsanitary waste disposal  causes gastro-intestinal problems, skin ailments, cholera, typhoid and  other infectious diseases. Malnutrition is highly visible among children.  At almost every turn, these factors thwart efforts by these communities  to become resilient. In addition to the conditions that prohibit more resilient systems from  developing within the slums, housing is fundamentally unstable. Most  of Nairobi's slums are situated on private lands. Consequently, residents  live with the threat of forced evictions and violent demolitions with no  warnings and no recourse. Eviction orders are often hidden by slumlord  cartels in order to mitigate the risk of losing rental income prior to the  evictions. Before demolitions and evictions, armed contingents of riot  police and provincial administration gather at local police stations. Massive  bulldozers and excavators are stationed around the settlements with  the owners' addresses carefully concealed and camouﬂaged. On many  occasions, vigilante groups from neighboring areas are hired to ensure  ""adequate security"" during the demolitions.These forced evictions and demolitions have resulted in the displacement  of entire communities, plunging hundreds of thousands of people further  into excruciating poverty as they are forced to begin rebuilding their lives  from scratch. The destruction of small businesses and micro enterprises  worsens the state's already dire unemployment rate, while individual slum  dwellers lose everything, including the friends, neighbors and community  connections they have developed over time. Children's education is  disrupted and a culture of violence is embedded into their psyche as  they watch their parents and relatives ﬁghting back attempts to violently  demolish their homes. While new slums are often created on unfenced  parcels of land close to the eviction area, a fresh demolition at a later  date is inevitable, and the incessant cycle of forced evictions and violent  demolitions creates an environment where thousands of slum-dwellers  are teetering on the precipice of a revolt, making slums a potential source  of national, regional and global insecurity. The Mukuru slum in Nairobi sits on private land. Since the value of the  Mukuru plots has appreciated over the years, the registered title deed  holders are in the process of selling them, and for the slum residents the  threat of evictions has become very real. In 2007, something remarkable happened in Mukuru. A few leaders of a  small saving scheme of slum dwellers approached my organization, the  Akiba Mashinani Trust (AMT), which is supported in its efforts to build  resilience by The Rockefeller Foundation, asking for assistance in dealing  with the problem of evictions. They decided to shop around for available  plots of land and began saving a portion of their daily incomes. After a  short while, they identiﬁed a 23-acre plot situated in Mukuru Kwa Njenga  belonging to a local company called Milwhite Limited. The asking price  was Ksh. 104 million (USD 1,235,000). Seeing the commitment of the slum  dwellers, AMT then engaged with the land owner and negotiated the price down to Kshs. 81 million (USD 963,000), and began searching for  a commercial bank that would be willing to ﬁnance the slum dwellers for  the remaining purchase price of the land. The members of the Mukuru saving scheme developed a robust system  to collect and track funds, which itself was resilient. The scheme is  organized into twenty-three zones. Each has its own leadership a  chairman, a treasurer and a collector. Every day the collector visits each  member within the zone and collects whatever funds are available and  the funds are meticulously logged in a redundant system with checks  and controls. The savers meet once a week at the zonal level, to check on their savings  and to share information. At least once a year the scheme audits its  accounts. A trained team of members from the various zones conducts  the audit. After the audit, the results are shared with the zonal leaders  and recommendations on how to improve the saving systems of the  scheme is shared.As part of the land purchase, AMT approached several banks for  ﬁnancing, all of whom were very keen to collect the impressive deposits  of the slum dwellers. But they were all, however, hesitant to issue a land  purchase loan to AMT for a variety of reasons, including that they were  not equipped to transact business with a large groups of slum dwellers. AMT was able to secure a 5-year term bank loan of Kshs. 55 million (USD 653,600) for the purchase of the land. This was only done after placing  a cash guarantee of Kshs. 24 million (USD 285,000) from SDI through  the support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Thanks to the  vibrant savings of the 2,200 Mukuru residents, the loan was fully repaid  within 1 year and 7 months of the disbursement.There are other impressive examples of slum dwellers, undeterred by  their low societal standing, using new Kenyan constitutional provisions  that give Kenyans the right to housing making their communities more  resilient. I was proud to be recognized for the work of AMT at The  Rockefeller Foundation 2011 Innovation Forum. Recently, as the Mukuru people were in the process of completing the  planning of their land, many of the members were faced with eviction  from their homes by land owners. As a result of the relationships  developed over time, the leaders of the saving scheme jointly began  to gather information on the eviction process and began to organize  themselves and built relationships with their local churches and schools  for greater solidarity. They obtained temporary court orders barring the land owners from evicting them, they organized protests and marches and  built public awareness of their plight. While the plan of the Mukuru residents was reliant on outside funding  and technical expertise, their scheme worked because it was theirs,  and community members could intrinsically trust it. Despite high levels  of instability, violence and poverty, slum residents were able to look out  for themselves by pooling meager resources that in the aggregate were  signiﬁcant. This is a valuable lesson for similar communities around the  world that seek to make themselves more resilient.This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post and The Rockefeller Foundation on resilience, a topic being discussed at the 2013 World Economic Forum in Davos.

A typhoon strikes in Southeast Asia, and suddenly the world cannot get the latex gloves essential for surgery. A pandemic causes demand to spike for health care products, and there is a global shortage of essential medical goods. At the World Economic Forum in Davos this year, a group of business, academic and government leaders discussed potential scenarios like these and what we can do to prepare for them in a session titled ""Global Supply Chain Resilience."" As chairman and CEO of the world's largest provider of health care products and services to the office-based medical, dental and animal health practitioner, I was fortunate to serve on the panel, which was moderated by Dr. Shirley Ann Jackson, the president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, alongside fellow panelists Marcelo Claure, chairman, CEO and president, Brightstar Corp.; Koji Sekimizu, secretary-general, International Maritime Organization; and Tarek Sultan, chairman and managing director, Agility.The world's supply chain forms the backbone of our global economy, security and health, and the risks it faces are many. The five ""P's"" of powerful weather, pandemic, political instability, port closures, and primary sourcing can easily cause disruption, potentially triggering a cascading effect for millions. Take Hurricane Sandy, which devastated coastal New York and New Jersey a few months ago. Sandy's effects were far greater than society was prepared for, with hospitals shut down because of power outages and gas lines miles in length as tankers couldn't deliver fuel because of port damage.And the risks are increasing. With global warming and population growth, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association reports that weather-related disasters have increased sharply over the past three decades.Narrow regional sourcing dependence also puts us at risk. For example, more than half of the world's production of medical and dental hand instruments is dependent on processing in the South Asia, and more than 90 percent of exam and surgical gloves are produced in Southeast Asia. Demand shocks present another risk. With influenza vaccine production limited to a few large multinational companies, the World Health Organization predicts that there would be an insufficient global vaccine supply during a pandemic. And global interconnectedness and the threat of antibiotic resistance make pandemics more likely in the future. What to do? We cannot plan for precisely how or when, but we can plan for the fact that disruptions will strike. We must create supply chain resilience to enable us to respond. Sound business practices, such as increased investment in areas of potential disruption, maintaining a robust global network to ensure flexibility, analysis of past disruptions to bolster contingency planning, and detailed disaster preparedness and relief planning are essential. We must utilize available tools and develop new ones to enhance information flow, facilitate partnerships and build strong networks based on trust.Like most global challenges we face, no single sector can effectively address supply chain issues alone. The only effective solution is public-private partnerships. At the height of the SARS epidemic, Henry Schein received an urgent call from the government of Hong Kong with requesting two million masks. Our ability to deliver on this dramatic spike in demand within four days depended on our close relationships with our transportation partners, government officials and our supplier partners. When a major producer of the flu vaccine shut down manufacturing operations a few years ago, our ability to get essential vaccines to health practitioners at the height of flu season depended on our tightly knit partnerships with suppliers and public sector actors.The same holds true when preparing for disasters. Through our global corporate social responsibility program, Henry Schein Cares, we have developed a model of collaborative public-private partnership with our supplier partners, NGOs, governments and others. We do not start from scratch once a disaster strikes. Instead, we have pre-positioned pallets of emergency medical supplies in the warehouses of our NGO partners to facilitate their immediate response.The international community's current ability to respond to the global supply chain risks we face is inadequate, but thanks to the World Economic Forum's ability to bring together the world's leading experts and key stakeholders, critical discussions are taking place. But we must continue to do better. No one actor or sector can go it alone. Collaborative partnership, proactive planning, open communication and effective coordination are the only solution. The next crisis we face is not a matter of if. It is not even so much a matter of when. If we don't do something more, and soon, it will be a matter of how bad.As a society, we need to move fast to make sure the answer to this question is: Not nearly as bad as it could have been.Stanley M.

(Photo by Danny Moloshok/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb413c1260000cf0082417f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I had a chance this weekend to see Afternoon Delight, which just debuted at Sundance. First-time feature director Jill Soloway, who previously worked on Six Feet Under and The United States of Tara, has written and created a film that is both hilarious and sad, real but still fun, and breaks barriers for women in film. Its realistic portrayal of women's lives and its cast of women characters make it a refreshing change from most female-centric movies. Kathryn Hahn (who was great in Parks and Recreation) plays Rachel, a suburban housewife in Silver Lake who is bored out of her mind. While some might think she has it all -- husband, kid, beautiful house in the LA suburbs -- she's miserable and lacks the sense of purpose that, in my opinion, a career could have given her. She vaguely mentions dreams of writing, but seems uninspired and unmotivated to work on it. She's married to Jeff (Josh Radnor of How I Met Your Mother), an app developer who recently sold his Farmville-like app ""Happy Farm,"" which turns him into a workaholic who's rarely home and never looks up when is home, as he constantly taps away at his iPhone and ignores his family. Rachel also shares her frustrations every week with her therapist, a hilarious supporting character played by Jane Lynch. Realizing her marriage has hit a six-month dry spell, Rachel decides to spice up their sex life by going to a strip club with her husband. She becomes fascinated with a stripper and sex worker named McKenna (Juno Temple), and subsequently befriends McKenna, brings her home to live with her family, and attempts to ""save"" her. Rachel uses ""saving"" the stripper as a personal project to fill an empty void in her life, and it's implied she's desperately hoping to learn something from McKenna that might help spice up things in the bedroom. Rachel's budding friendship with McKenna causes Rachel to examine her own life and begin exploring her sexuality - a bold move by Soloway, given that female sexuality and self-expression is still taboo in film and television. Rachel's character goes through a personal journey of self-discovery through the course of the film, and women who are watching will likely find themselves relating to her troubles. It's refreshing to see an incredibly talented actress like Kathryn Hahn tackle a leading role, after frequently being relegated to supporting characters.One memorable scene takes place during at a girls' night with friends, where Rachel makes a few dark but funny abortion jokes -- another taboo that this movie breaks. Abortion is still rarely discussed on screen, despite the fact that an estimated 40 percent of American women have had abortions. In a recent interview, Kathryn Hahn told the reporter about filming that scene: ""It just seemed so like what women talk about, what moms would talk about and say when you're approaching 40. It didn't seem like it was being scandalous. It was just a bunch of awesome ladies sitting around talking. It didn't feel like it was going to be like, 'Oh, this is gonna be really hot button.' It just felt like women sitting around, talking about their sex lives, the life that they had before children."" That is exactly what makes this film so enjoyable: it dares to openly discuss topics women experience and discuss privately, but that are rarely acknowledged in film as many (often male) film executives still find them too risky. These are real women's lives, the highs and the low lows, with no sugarcoating and no pulling punches.Another bright spot in the film are Rachel's crew of mom friends, who volunteer together at the Jewish Community Center. Played by Jessica St. Clair, Michaela Watkins, and Annie Mumolo, these three are each so quirky and entertaining in their own ways that one can only wish that they had been given more screen time. Michaela Watkins in particular really shines, playing an overly chirpy PTA mom who in the first minutes of the film cracked me up with her peppy Facebook enthusiasm: ""Okay, I'm going to post this video right now, and when you get home, make sure you all 'like' it! And don't just like it, make sure to share it too, and tell your friends to like it!"" One of the best scenes in the movie is towards the climax, cutting back and forth between a guys' night with Jeff and a girls' night with Rachel. The film takes a turn away from its previous lightheartedness, but Soloway and her cast dare to go where others won't - perhaps enough to make some audiences uncomfortable. Some early reviews have found this scene controversial and argued that it is too dark. But I'd argue that this scene -- and the whole film itself -- is captivating because it is real, and raw, and emotional. There's something to be said for depicting honest, real life with all its flaws and complexities, rather than a Hollywood-ized fantasy version of life. Afternoon Delight is sweet, hilarious, and emotional all at the same time. Between McKenna, Rachel, and her friends, the film has a cast full of rich, well-developed female characters. It's refreshing that the film centers around a woman's interior life, her personal struggles and doubts and fears, and her friendships with other women -- without having to retreat to tropes about weddings, babies, or ""having it all."" This is director Jill Soloway's first feature film, and she knocks it out of the park. I hope that Hollywood will pay attention and a major film studio will buy Afternoon Delight soon, so that every woman will have the opportunity to see it in theaters."

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb413cd2400003000977b33.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I love the rush of physical terror in an otherwise controlled environment -- that brief clutching of the heart that seizes you without actually making you feel unsafe. There were a lot more outlets for this kind of thing before I developed a sensitive lower back (no more roller coasters) and a sense of my own mortality (no more thrill rides in general). Now I just watch a lot of horror movies. Last night I went to see Mama, starring Jessica Chastain with black hair (spoiler alert: black hair looks sexy on her) and Nikolaj Coster Waldau, who proves to be just as handsome and intrepid as he is in Game of Thrones, though slightly less incestuous (frowny face). Without giving anything away, Mama is about a dead lady (""Mama""), who connects with her surrogate children via vagina-shaped holes in the wall. To be fair, these holes are more like animate shadows that sort of breathe and spit moths, and the film itself is very scary. I had bruises afterward from jerking around in my seat and knocking my knees on the cup holders, and spent most of the 100-minute thrill ride with my cheek pressed into my companion's neck. Turns out there's not much creepier or more captivating than feral children skittering around like crabs.Mama is produced by Guillermo del Toro, the guy who brought us Pan's Labyrinth, so you can expect elements of fantasy and tenderness, which make the film moving and thought provoking as well as frightening. Aesthetically and story-wise, imagine something along the lines of Pan's Labyrinth meets Hansel and Gretel meets The Orphan meets The Ring, and you have Mama. Like most horror movies, Mama loses a lot of steam once you get a good, long look at Mama, herself. But in this case, I felt like the deflation was more due to Mama's humanity than it was to bad make-up or cartoonish special effects (i.e., not the same as whatever disappointment you may have felt upon finally seeing the aliens in Signs). By the time we finally see Mama, we understand her -- we feel bad for her -- and empathy will make you less afraid of anybody. Like Pan's Labyrinth, Mama has a bittersweet and unexpected ending, which you don't often find with horror films. But perhaps my favorite aspect of the movie (aside from the fact that it made me very, very afraid) is that it paints a refreshingly complicated and ultimately poignant portrait of female relationships; the women in Mama are grouchy and loyal and sensitive -- prickly pears, in other words -- which is exciting in my book, since most female characters in horror movies are either brainless cheerleaders or furious punks (easy to kill, in other words).In conclusion: I give it two thumbs up -- with the actual thumbs jammed into my ears to block out that weird, clicking, drowning noise Mama makes whenever she slithers through her favorite vagina portals.

Richard Blanco's excellent inaugural poem has rightfully attracted most of the attention, but the promise of the President's second term had a lot of people feeling poetic. I wrote last week about The Takeaway's fascinating crowd-sourced inaugural verse (you can take a look at the result here). Even ever-literary Hollywood A-lister James Franco wrote a poem for the occasion.But another poem came to light that speaks to a challenge that the president will face in his second term, and to an issue that sharply divides us. Ernie Gullerud, a retired professor, found the previously unknown poem by Carl Sandburg while volunteering in the University of Illinois Library. It turns out that Sandburg, who once said of poetic form: ""If it jells into free verse, all right. If it jells into rhyme, all right,"" had far stronger feelings about guns. ""Here is a revolver"" the poem begins. ""It has an amazing language all its own."" Gullerud was so struck by the poem's power and timeliness that he made sure it got some attention. The national media has started to take notice, but the best discussion of the poem might be posted on the University of Illinois' website, where Valerie Hotchkiss, the head of the University's Rare Book and Manuscript Library, describes how Sandburg viewed the power of the revolver's ""language"":""I think it's so interesting that Sandburg says poetically what we all know about guns: that they are the final word. But he takes the idea one step forward to meditate on the effect of guns on freedom of speech -- how the First Amendment is watered down by the Second Amendment. If somebody has a gun to your head, you can't speak freely.""Here's how Sandburg, in the poem, describes the power of a revolver's ""speech"":  When it has spoken, the case can not be appealed to the supreme court, nor any mandamus nor any injunction nor any stay of execution in and interfere with the original purpose.He ends the poem with the poignant line:And nothing in human philosophy persists more strangely than the old belief that God is always on the side of those who have the most revolvers.Sandburg wrote an immensely popular (and just plain immense) biography of Abraham Lincoln, and some have speculated that Lincoln's assassination may have inspired the poem. Here's hoping Sandburg's poem can inspire some sensible debate about addressing gun violence. At least, in a week of new beginnings, it's a good place to start.You can read Sandburg's entire poem here."

The hooded menace and his star quarterback are on the decline. So long, Patriots Dynasty.Sound familiar?Despite not registering fewer than 10 regular-season wins in any year since they last won the Super Bowl after the 2004 season, every campaign without a ticker tape parade is treated as the proof that the Belichick-Brady era is over. It was supposedly finished for them last year after their Super Bowl loss to the New York Giants. The sky was also falling after a postseason loss at home to the Jets the season before that. The dynasty was also over the year before that. And the year before that. For all the annual doom and gloom, it's not as if the Patriots have completely fallen out of contention. Even with the Patriots' 8-7 postseason record after the last Super Bowl win of the Brady-Belichick era, that number still shows they have a good chance to win it all every year. The Pats won 12 games in the regular season this year. They won 13 last year. 14 the year before that. 10 before that.Yes, Bill Belichick and Tom Brady's postseason numbers since New England's last championship look a lot different than their early years. The Pats looked unstoppable in the postseason when Brady first took. By 2004, the duo was 9-0 in the playoffs with three Super Bowl wins, two of which Brady was named MVP. Since then, he's 8-7 in the playoffs with two Super Bowl losses. Three of those postseason defeats came at Foxboro. And when Brady was out for a season, the Matt Cassel-led Patriots lost in the first round to Baltimore, 30-7. So go ahead and talk about the end of the Brady-Belichick era. Keep talking about Brady's age. Keep going on and on about how their window is closing. Sure. But how many AFC teams will enter next season markedly better than the Pats? Maybe Baltimore and Pittsburgh. Maybe Denver (Peyton is 36). The younger players on the Patriots are less concerned with the team's relationship to the previous winning clubs and more concerned with creating a new legacy. “That whole era is over with. It’s gone. So this is a whole new team,"" Patriots defensive end Rob Ninkovich told WEEI one day after the AFC title game. ""It’s a different bunch of guys. We all have to experience it and learn for ourselves what it’s like."""

That's doesn't matter anymore. Sunday afternoon the Boston Celtics tweeted the bad news that Rajon Rondo, the team's All-Star point guard -- and one the NBA's best all around basketball players -- has suffered a torn anterior cruciate ligament and will miss the remainder of the 2012-13 season. For a Celtics team that had struggled all season to work new players into their system, and get consistent play from their aging veterans the news could not be worse.Now Boston must face some very tough choices. Are the Celtics prepared to try and trade for a point guard to fill in for the remainder of the season? Can Avery Bradley, a player known mainly for his defense fill-in at the point guard position? The Celtics could also decide to shop veteran small forward Paul Pierce. Pierce can become a free agent following this season's conclusion. Now in his 15th season as a Celtic. He is the franchise's second all-time leading scorer. Dealing Pierce was signal the end of an era in Boston. Ken Berger of CBS Sports has already suggested that Pierce could be traded to Memphis in exchange for Rudy Gay. There is little chance the Celtics will find an adequate replacement for Rondo, whose 11.1 assists per game lead the NBA. Avery Bradley figures to receive the bulk of minutes at point guard in the short-term. Bradley doesn't have much experience running the point, but he's a stellar defender and great athlete. It was Bradley's emergence that forced veteran Ray Allen out of the starting lineup last spring. Now Celtics Head Coach Doc Rivers will turn to Bradley again, and this time the challenge will be even more daunting. Can Bradley handle the increased pressure of defending opposing point guards during a time of unprecedented depth and talent in the NBA at the position? Can Bradley efficiently distribute the ball to a Celtics roster that features two future hall of fame players in Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett, veterans Jason Terry and Courtney Lee and young players such as Jeff Green and rookie Jared Sullinger? With the Celtics' playoff status already in a precarious position, there will be plenty of people who will suggest the Celtics basically give-up on this season. When head coach Doc Rivers was asked by Yahoo Sports Adrian Wojnarowski about writing-off this season following the news of Rondo's injury, he responded that he wasn't ready to do that. ""You can write the obituary, but I'm not."" WIth a roster that has young talent and veteran leadership, as well as one of the NBA's more accomplished head coaches, the Celtics aren't ready to turn the page on the 2012-13 season. Replacing Rondo will be next to impossible, but the team is determined to make an effort. That was apparent on Sunday afternoon when the Rondo-less Celtics knocked off the defending NBA Champion Miami Heat in a double-overtime thriller in Boston.How much momentum the Celtics can take from Sunday afternoon's win is a big question. The win snapped a six-game losing steak and featured a triple-double from Paul Pierce, but the real test is yet to come. There are 38 games remaining in the regular season and the Celtics will need to play better basketball without Rajon Rondo than they were playing with the All-Star point guard. That's not going to be easy."

But I think we may be letting our abdominal viscera get the better of vital organs situated higher up.,2013-01-26,"This undated image shows a frame grab taken from a new commercial from Coca-Cola. The Atlanta-based company on Monday, Jan. 14, 2013, said it will start airing a two-minute spot during the highest-rated shows on CNN, Fox News and MSNBC in hopes of flexing its marketing muscle in the debate over sodas and their impact on public health. The ad lays out Coca-Cola's record of providing drinks with fewer calories over the years and notes that weight gain is the result of consuming too many calories of any kind, not just soda. (AP Photo/Coca0Cola)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cc1772200003000d95d36.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Responding to our justifiably increasing preoccupation with widespread obesity, the Coca-Cola Company has released a masterful television ad on the subject. They characterize their own efforts, and invite us all to ""come together"" to combat this scourge. The whole ""come together"" concept receives great emphasis, with evocative images from the (presumably) good old days of: ""I'd like to buy the world a Coke...""Predictably, the collective response of my friends and colleagues in public health has been less than warm and bubbly. Sensing a blend of propaganda, evasion, hypocrisy, and desperation in Coke's efforts, my clan has largely reacted with their own blend of dismissal, derision, and disgust. In essence, they have invited us all to lose this lunch, and roll our eyes.I confess, I am sorely tempted to join them. But before we can lose our lunch, we are perhaps obligated to chew on it. And before rolling our eyes, we may need to read the writing on the wall -- fine print, and all.Before that chewing and reading begins, I do want to insert a disclaimer. I am the furthest thing from a food industry apologist. I have devoted years of my life to the development of programs for children and adults alike that reveal the all-too-often lamentable truth about the so-called ""food"" supply. At every opportunity, I have highlighted the fact that ""betcha' can't eat just one"" was far more than a clever ad campaign; it was a threat to public health, backed up -- at least in the case of Kraft -- by nutritional biochemists and neuroscientists using functional MRI scans to determine how to maximize the number of calories it takes for us to feel full. And I have noted repeatedly, as I will continue to do, that as we got fat and our kids got diabetes -- somebody was chuckling about it all the way to the bank.Nor do I have even a little love for the Coca-Cola Company. I consider their flagship offering a chemistry experiment in a cup. I haven't had a soda in some 35 years since I first saw that light. Coca-Cola has systematically opposed public health campaigns to reduce soda consumption, deflected criticism, denied epidemiologic truths, and distorted their own contributions to epidemic obesity. I have -- at least in moments of private rage -- considered them an evil empire. Regarding my brief encounter with their CEO, I can only say I felt the dark side of the Force was strong with him.And when it comes to polished and compelling ads that obscure any semblance of truth, Coca-Cola has an impressive track record. They have given us polar bears enjoying Coke as they frolic in their winter wonderland.This is wrong in so many ways it's hard to know where to start. For one thing, polar bears don't drink soda. For another, that's not likely to help them much -- because we are blithely destroying their winter wonderland. And guess what? Concocting chemical potions in factories to drink out of plastic bottles when a glass of water would do nicely is part of the reason -- as such industrial activity contributes to global warming and the melting of Arctic ice on which the livelihood of real polar bears depends. So, no -- Coke is not offering polar bears a drink. It's part of the reason they may have nothing left to eat. But, of course, only part of a much bigger reason.Reacting to Coke's misleading depiction of polar bears, the Center for Science in the Public Interest engaged musician Jason Mraz, to give us the ""real"" bears. I fully support this campaign to show what might happen if polar bears actually did drink Coke. But of course, these aren't ""real"" bears -- because as noted, polar bears don't drink soda. So, the ""real"" issue is that we may not be smarter than the average bear after all. Bears are still eating and drinking what bears should eat and drink -- to the extent we aren't making it impossible for them. We, on the other hand, have been drinking Coca-Cola out of ever-larger containers.This just isn't about bears and the choices they make. It's about us, and the choices we make. And we apparently have some hard ones. We have water, but choose to drink Coke. We have broccoli, but choose to eat bologna. There are no bears involved. We have met the enemy -- and it is us.Yes, we are also the victim. Yes, the food industry really has manipulated us with foods engineered to specifications born of functional MRI scans. But come on: Does anyone think Coke is good for them? Does anyone not living under a rock think you can drink a gallon of that stuff daily and not suffer any consequences? Is there really anyone left who has not heard the rumors about sugar? And does anyone bemoaning the unbearable (pun intended) burden of a soda tax truly not know where to find a water fountain?Coke is quite right about one thing: We are all in this together.Consider that when McDonald's -- another good contender for the food industry's evil empire award -- gave us McLean Deluxe, we didn't buy it. The product expired not for want of supply, but for want of demand. Folks, that's not McDonalds' problem. It's yours, and mine. It's our kids' problem.Similarly, remember Alpha-Bits cereal? If you haven't seen it lately, here's why -- courtesy of some inside information. Post reduced both the salt and sugar content, actually making the product more nutritious -- and people stopped buying it. Sales plummeted from about $80 million a year, to $10 million.Most product reformulations that allegedly give us better nutrition are actually lateral moves -- fixing one thing, breaking another. Salt is reduced, but sugar is increased. Sugar is reduced, but trans fat is increased -- and so on. I have an intimate view of all this, courtesy of my work with the NuVal program, which has established a detailed nutrient database for over 100,000 foods it has scored. All too often, banner ads implying better nutrition are entirely misleading. Low-fat peanut butter is substantially less nutritious than regular. Multigrain breads may or may not be whole grain.But on those rare occasions when the food industry actually gives us better products, we don't buy them.Which brings us back to Coke: What, exactly, do we want from them?As I see it, against a backdrop of a growing burden of national and global chronic disease in which they are complicit, Coke has four options. They can (1) ignore the public health problem, and keep on keeping on; (2) acknowledge the public health problem, but say it's not their problem -- and keep on keeping on; (3) confess their corporate sins and absolve themselves with ceremonial suicide; or (4) change.Choices one and two have pretty much run their course. Shareholders are unlikely to bless option three. Which leaves us with option four: change. Change their product formulations. Change their inventory. And change their messaging. Stop talking about frolicking polar bears, and start talking about obesity. And while we have cause to be suspicious about Coca-Cola's motives, that's just what the new ad appears to be doing.Yes, they sell us chemistry experiments in a cup. Yes, they help us become fat diabetics. But they are also a large company, employing a lot of people. If we simply want to drive a stake through their corporate heart, the result would be a lot of newly-unemployed people, still prone to obesity and diabetes while drinking Pepsi, or Mountain Dew, or Dr. Pepper, while perusing the want ads.And yes, the new ad about obesity is only in response to mounting pressure from a concerned public, and restive federal authorities. But is it bad or surprising that supply-side changes are responsive to a changing demand? The business of business, after all, is business -- and keeping the customer satisfied.If we want truly meaningful changes in the quality of our food and drink, we will in fact require changes in both supply and demand. It won't help if they build it, and we don't come. There are ways to propagate a shared taste for change, and such a course might allow for substantial improvements in the public health without blowing up the Fortune 500.Admittedly, the new Coke ads addressing obesity are slick. Stunningly slick. In other words, they are just plain good -- working over the chords of emotional response exactly as intended. A testimony to what really deep pockets and top advertising talent can do. This could be just another reason to hate Coke, I suppose.But on the other hand, the simpler times when Coke was an innocent pleasure are not a Madison Avenue fabrication; they actually happened. We baby-boomers lived through them. There was a time before ultra-uber-gulps and widespread childhood obesity, and soda seemed an innocuous pleasure -- whether or not it ever really was. If that has changed over time, then so must we -- and so must Coca-Cola.What would such change look like? Probably something like the new ad.As a closing aside, I attended the meeting of my local school district wellness committee this week, as they took on the task of complying with Connecticut nutrition standards. The gentleman who runs the high school store noted that by complying with the new regulations, he would lose business to the array of fast-food outlets accessible to the students just across a parking lot. And, I suspect he's exactly right.I share my colleagues' visceral opposition to everything Coke. But I think we may be letting our abdominal viscera get the better of vital organs situated higher up. Soft drinks do exist; they are big business. Doing something about that involves hard choices.Change -- incremental change -- is the most promising and plausible of them. So we have to allow for it if what we want is progress. If we won't accept change without calling it hypocrisy, then we don't really want progress. We want revenge.-finDr. David L.

If anger exists between you and your ex, it may trickle down to the children. And game playing between you and your former spouse can be more trying on your kids than you can imagine. There should be no ""ex games"" when it comes to your children. Your children should never be caught in the middle of problems with your ex. Here are seven things that you and your ex-spouse can do to make things more civilized for the kids.Plan together: Put any bad feelings aside and create an organized plan with your ex regarding birthdays and holidays. The more organized you both are for these occasions, the better it will be for the kids. Limit the questions: When the kids come home from visiting your ex, there's no reason to pepper them with questions about the time they spent there. Listen to them if they want to talk about it, but don't cross-examine them.Keep your feelings to yourself: Don't speak badly about your ex in front of your kids. This will put your children in an uncomfortable position, and you want them to have a healthy relationship with the both of you. Keep it civil: Even if your ex says something you don't like, try to keep it civil. Treat the situation as though you are talking with a co-worker that you're not fond of, but have to deal with. This will make for a more amicable situation. Learn to be in the same room: It's important to learn how to be in the same room with your ex after divorce. The kids may have a school play or sporting event that you both would like to attend. Get used to putting any animosity behind you when it comes to events with your kids. Coordinate gift giving:: There's no need to compete with your ex to show your kids a better time. Be on the same page about giving gifts for all birthdays and holidays.Share photos: Send some photos via email to each other of your children enjoying themselves at each of your homes. It's important to keep the kids as the focus and not your problems during the post-divorce process.For more divorce parenting tips pick up Lois Tarter's new book ""The Divorce Ritual"" by clicking here."

Our brains are incapable of processing any more data relating to Steve Jobs, Oprah or the Queen. That leaves us with Sully Sullenberger. We need new icons to emulate as the twenty-teens roll on. My not-so-obvious choices for the revised list:Mike Tyson. If ever there was a guy we were born to hate, it's Tyson. He was hardly the people's champ, with his thuggish behavior, rape conviction and bizarre face tattoo.He did three years on the rape rap. Prison rehabilitated him, as he proved by biting off a piece of Evander Holyfield's ear.Broke -- having squandered $300 million -- diagnosed as bipolar, Tyson seemed headed for a steep fall down the Google search rankings into obscurity, if not poverty.But Mike is pure. A 100 percent, unadulterated, seemingly irredeemable f**k-up trying to get un- f**ked and as such, is the object of some fascination.There was a semi-confessional documentary. TV appearances. He was in The Hangover. And the sequel. In the sequel to come. He is a motivational speaker. When last we checked, he was a vegan. (Did I mention, he bit off a guy's ear!?) Spike Lee is directing a Tyson one-man show on Broadway and has compared the pug's storytelling skills to that of Mark Twain.No one does comebacks like a boxer, and Tyson's story stokes our belief in redemption. Holyfield had his ear sewed back, but Evander's probably sitting in his mega-mansion wondering why he never got a one-man show. He can always call Joe Frazier to commiserate.Let it go, champs. It's not about the deeds, it's about the drama. After hearing Tyson's story, even Bernie Madoff can hope for a comeback.Clint Eastwood. First, I am going to ask that you clear your mind of the snarky empty chair routine and his Mitt-night ramblings at the GOP convention.Ok? Gone? Now listen: Eastwood is Hollywood's compassionate conservative. Few directors have made more movies about the downtrodden and the 47 percent. With films such as Mystic River, Changeling, Million Dollar Baby and Gran Torino, he counters the claim that all conservatives are ""out of touch."" Even the ballistic NRA saint Harry Callahan was just a working stiff strutting toward a detective's pension.In France, Honkytonk Man was compared to The Grapes of Wrath. (They made him a Commander in the Legion of Honor, a rank he shares with Jerry Lewis).Clint's storytelling conveys genuine compassion; his characters eat gluten and don't own Cuisinarts; he's much in touch.Ike. Obama plays basketball; Clinton and Bush stuck with golf. But President Dwight Eisenhower played poker, and poker is more American than warfare. Ike learned the game as a boy in Abilene, Kansas in the 1890s, and he was very good.The Supreme Commander knew what every card shark knows -- it's not just about the hand, but about knowing your opponent's hand and how he's likely to play it. It's called positional awareness. Ike seemed vague or weak at times, then stubborn and tough; he knew how to bluff. Eisenhower is among the ten best on nearly every American president ranking.Its time for our foreign policy makers to play more poker, less Call of Duty. Keep drones in your vest pocket, just in case. If poker doesn't work, and the hand is weak, follow Ike's other example -- stand up, upend the card table and declare D-Day.Candy Crowley. Anchoring is a tough business, especially if you are a woman. You need brains, a work ethic. You also have to be eye candy. Except in the case of Candy Crowley. Crowley has endured demeaning, insulting remarks and tweets about her weight, especially from right-wingers who thought she was too sympathetic to Obama, calling her a ""fat ass"" and ""liberal pig"" And this is nothing new; people have been writing and talking about her weight for years.She's good at her job, always has been, and has chosen to deal with her issues in her own way. While she may not be a role model when it comes to the ideal weight, we should all laud her ability to shake it off, and do excellent work with good cheer and no small amount of dignity. The next time you cringe at the mirror at the sight of a few extra pounds, think of Candy comfortably moderating the Presidential debate, smile, and give the world the finger.Arnold Schwarzenegger. Down on the Arnold for his bad behavior? We understand. We all know the story by now, but here's a reminder: this is a man who arrived in Santa Monica short on money, education and contacts, and -- in ascending order of improbability -- dominates the body building world, makes multimillions in real estate, becomes a top-grossing movie star while speaking lines with an accent more Teutonic than Kissinger, and tops that by becoming a two-term governor of California.What's on your resume?This fame/money/power trifecta would be unlikely for a fifth generation American from Tennessee. But for an Austrian immigrant? Miraculous. Skim off the luck and you are still left with an inspiring story of drive, hard work and determination. Yes, and he married a Kennedy, or rather, a Kennedy married him. As the world becomes more competitive, we could all use a dose of Arnold's focus formula and, as the Austrians would say, chutzpe.Disclaimer. That thing he did, with the maid, even besting Woody Allen and Bill Clinton for creepiness? You just have to minus the sexual misconduct, or we'd have no icons at all. Even Albert Einstein screwed around.The Rope-A-Dopers. Ali and Reagan don't have much in common but for their use of the ""rope- a-dope,"" which reminds us that sometimes, brute force tactics should be avoided.Ali flummoxed George Foreman, tricking his opponent into depleting his energy and giving him a taste of the canvas. Ronald Reagan's tough talk and threats to build an expensive missile shield flummoxed the Soviets when they had already maxed out their credit card. Reagan was ""putting pressure on us -- to exhaust us,"" said Mikhail Gorbachev.The tactic still works. Osama bin Laden? In the end, punched out and burned out, holed up in a dull compound without air conditioning for six years, slurping ""natural Viagra"" oat syrup, dyeing his beard with Just for Men, communicating by snail mail, and watching an ancient 14"" thick screen portable TV in a sparse room filled with dangling wires. Worse, his wives were feuding like fundamentalist Mormons.Where was the finger-wagging dirty bomber, who in 1998, ridiculed ""the weakness of the American soldier?"" Where was the pitched battle with his army of chanting Jihadist warriors that starred in his videos? Rope-a-doped.Donald Trump 1.0. For a few short years, he was a role model for the young and ambitious on the make in New York. I'll admit, even then he was called obnoxious, overrated, and showed early signs of his now-legendary narcissism. But he had vision, he had vitality, he had flair. By 1972, he was reportedly worth $200 million and not yet thirty.In the bars and conference rooms of Manhattan, young men bellowed that they wanted to be like Donald Trump. They said it to one another, not just to women when trying to get laid.Even before the various towers Trump, he altered the face of the city. He virtually rebuilt the old Commodore Hotel at Grand Central, transforming it into the Grand Hyatt. The remake was so dramatic even the hotel hookers were confused because they couldn't find the johns' rooms after the remodeling.The New York real estate establishment declined to rescue the failing renovation of Central Parks' cherished Wollman Rink, but Trump stepped forward and brought it in under budget. He jump- started the Javits Convention Center. He married an athletic and capable Czech beauty, Ivana. (Since wives, unlike hotels, cannot be renovated, he's had to replace them twice; in between, he rented).Wouldn't it be great if Donald fired himself, quit his show and his business-fetish clothing line and devoted his time to rebuilding and storm-proofing the five boroughs, free of charge? After all, he built his own fortune with government help and heavy debt, so he knows just what to do. He could go from Celebrity Apprentice to Sorcerer's Apprentice and stop the flooding.Probably not gonna happen. Unless his kids come out from under his comb-over and stage an intervention, I'll take my inspiration from 70s Trump."

19,BLACK VOICES,Puzzling Leadership Gap as New York NAACP Joins Soda Industry to Fight Ban,"Sonia Ospina, Contributor
Professor, NYU Wagner",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/soda-ban_us_5badd42ce4b0bb1705fb03f4,"While actors in both the government and nonprofits claim to be working for the public interest and should be defending it at all costs, they are ignoring that common ground. Why aren't the leaders of these public service organizations engaging in a conversation around what constitutes their shared vision?",2013-01-26,"Various size cups and sugar cubes are displayed at a news conference at New York's City Hall, Thursday, May 31, 2012. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is proposing a ban on the sale of large sodas and other sugary drinks in the city's restaurants, delis and movie theaters in the hopes of combating obesity, an expansion of his administration's efforts to encourage healthy behavior by limiting residents' choices. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badd42c24000031009641bc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A New York Times article this week, ""In N.A.A.C.P., Industry Gets Ally Against Soda Ban,"" seems to indicate a leadership failure across sectors.According to the article, the New York chapter of the NAACP and the Hispanic Federation, two institutions committed to representing the interests of African Americans and Latinos, joined the soda industry in fighting a New York City government ban on big sodas. This is despite the fact that African Americans and Latinos are collectively approaching a 70 percent obesity rate in the city, a figure even worse in many low-income areas.  The nonprofits' stated concern is that the regulation would harm minority-owned businesses due to a ""quirk in New York's regulatory structure"" that exempts 7-Elevens from the soda restrictions applied to other businesses. So minority-run businesses and corner bodegas would be forced to stop selling the big sugary beverages, losing customers to nearby 7-Elevens.  However, the article points to pressure from Coca-Cola that may have accompanied its grants to the NAACP as well as the former president of the Hispanic Federation taking a job with the soda company as the true prompts for the nonprofits' support of the ban.  So we have a case of government health officials and nonprofits -- both with explicit missions to protect the public interest -- lining up to fight each other, at the same time that corporate social responsibility programs may have run amok and are now being used as leverage in a pro-soda agenda. This seems to be a case of leadership failure on all sides. This is particularly the case if we think of leadership as something that does not belong to a single individual, or ""leader,"" but to a community with shared values, where people work together to frame the way they see and explain their problems, bridge differences to find common solutions, and dedicate their energy and abilities to addressing them. So while actors in both the government and nonprofits claim to be working for the public interest and should be defending it at all costs, they are ignoring that common ground. Why aren't the leaders of these public service organizations engaging in a conversation around what constitutes their shared vision?  In addition, the reporting in the story suggests a surprising lack of leadership on the part of an institution as serious as The New York Times. It certainly obscures more than it clarifies in an already messy situation, with the information about the nonprofits' concerns for minority-owned businesses relegated to the second half of the article. While thankfully, there are no ""sacred cows"" in journalism, in a case where the reputations of two such storied nonprofits hang in the balance, thorough reporting is in order.  Here is a five-point plan for what leadership by the actors in each sector would look like.1. Nonprofits: NAACP New York and the Hispanic Federation could aggressively search for allies to tackle the regulatory structure creating disparities, instead of joining corporate interests to fight a public health measure that could help their constituents.2. The nonprofits could also convene a conversation with policymakers and government agencies to address the issue of protecting minority-run businesses without this happening at the expense of their communities' health. 3. Government: The government could address the quirks in regulation that produce inequality and strategically recruit nonprofit help to address this issue within the broader system as parallel strategies to promoting its public health measure. 4. Private Industry: In this case, Coca-Cola's corporate social responsibility is bumping up against its quest to keep an unhealthy product in the market to ensure a profit margin. It offers both a cautionary tale to nonprofits and a lesson for other industry giants that if the aim of grantmaking is to improve a company's community relations, putting nonprofits in a position that conflicts with their missions is bound to backfire. Companies should give grants without these problematic strings attached. 5. Journalism: Keeping in mind the reach of The New York Times and the trust readers place in its framing and explanation of issues, a follow-up story that includes a more thorough review of the case and the perspectives involved is necessary.  This is an instance in which public service actors have failed a key lesson of Leadership 101: Find ways to frame the issues and take actions that bridge the differences obscuring a larger shared vision: a healthier and more equitable world for all."
