2,POLITICS,Is Data Hoarding Necessary For Lawful Surveillance?,"Joan Feigenbaum and Bryan Ford, Contributors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/data-hoarding-surveillance_b_5179305.html,"One essential question has received little attention: Is amassing mountains of privacy-sensitive ""metadata"" technically necessary for effective, lawful electronic tracking and surveillance of legitimate targets? The answer is emphatically no.",2014-04-19,"In this undated file photo made available by Google shows the campus-network room at a data center in Council Bluffs, Iowa. With the cooperation of foreign allies, the NSA is potentially gaining access to every email sent or received abroad, or between people abroad, from Google and Yahoo?s email services, as well as anything in Google Docs, Maps or Voice, according to a series of articles in the Washington Post. (AP Photo/Google, Connie Zhou, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d4225b260000132951ec04.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The NSA's mass surveillance activities, including the collection of billions of U.S. cell phone records every day, have sparked vigorous debate about whether such surveillance is legal, consistent with democratic principles, or effective in catching the terrorists it ostensibly targets. One essential question has received little attention, however: Is amassing mountains of privacy-sensitive ""metadata"" technically necessary for effective, lawful electronic tracking and surveillance of legitimate targets?The answer is emphatically no. Well understood cryptographic techniques can enable lawful intercept and surveillance without the creation of centralized hoards of personal information. This is not a geeky footnote in the mass surveillance saga. Such hoards are dangerous as well as unnecessary; they could be leaked or sold to a foreign state or criminal gang by a future, more venal incarnation of Edward Snowden.The FBI is already adept at catching criminals without hoarding the cell phone metadata of all Americans. The High Country Bandits were two men who robbed 16 rural banks in Arizona and Colorado before being caught. After one bandit was observed using a cell phone near a robbery site, the FBI obtained cell tower dumps -- records from cellular providers listing all cell phones that had electronically ""checked in"" around the locations and times of three past robberies. This request yielded three sets of phone numbers, one from each cell tower, containing approximately 150,000 numbers in total. However, only one phone number appeared in the intersection of these sets, i.e., in all three: that of the phone one bandit had carried during the robberies. The bandit need not have made any calls; his phone merely needed to have been powered on and communicating with the cell towers.In computer security, this is known as an intersection attack, with the FBI in this case playing the role of ""attacker."" Intersection attacks are a powerful, general, and in this case effective method of answering questions of the form, ""What is common to several large heaps of otherwise meaningless-looking data?""Intersection attacks are also evidently the foundation of the NSA's CO-TRAVELER program. To find unknown associates of a known target, the NSA collects cell tower dumps of all users carrying cell phones near the target at different locations and times. The NSA then identifies previously unknown cell phone numbers common to several of these sets, representing people who may be ""traveling with"" the target. Although the U.S. government has offered scant evidence of this claim, let us assume for the sake of argument that location-tracking methods like CO-TRAVELER are effective at catching terrorists.The FBI did not need to hoard the cell phone records of all Americans to catch the High Country Bandits, but they still swept 149,999 other phone numbers into their intersection attack: numbers probably belonging to innocent people who happened to be in the vicinity of one robbery site but not all three. Did the FBI immediately delete the rest of these phone numbers, or were they stashed for possible use in future investigations? Part of the widespread opposition to New York City's ""stop-and-frisk"" regime was the NYPD's policy of retaining the names, addresses, and descriptions of people who had been stopped, frisked, determined to be doing nothing illegal, and released without ever having been arrested, much less convicted of a crime. Should the FBI need to do the equivalent of a retroactive ""stop and frisk"" of 149,999 innocent cell phone users, gathering their phone numbers and potentially storing them forever to use in ways yet to be determined, in the process of catching one pair of bandits? Even if the FBI were to declare a policy of deleting data incidentally collected on users not under suspicion, must Americans simply trust that every FBI agent will follow this policy faithfully?The answer is still no. Modern cryptography has moved far beyond merely encrypting and decrypting data. We can now perform many computations on encrypted data, while keeping it encrypted and unknown to the parties performing the computation. For example, we have efficient methods for privacy-preserving set intersection, which start with several sets of encrypted items, decrypt only the elements in the intersection, and leave items not in the intersection encrypted and unreadable by anyone. Thus, cell phone carriers could have stored cell tower data in encrypted form, used privacy-preserving set intersection, and delivered only the bandit's phone number to the FBI without disclosing the other 149,999 phone numbers to anyone. This may sound like magic, but it is merely an illustration of sci-fi author Arthur C. Clarke's maxim that ""any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.""Like any technology, modern cryptography can be misused: for example, to conceal spy agencies' activities without accountability or privacy protection for innocent users. Proper uses should ensure that lawful electronic surveillance activities protect the innocent, are properly authorized and limited in scope, are subject to robust oversight, and follow transparent processes that the public can debate or challenge in court. With proper system design, adequately informed by both policy and technological capabilities, this combination of surveillance power and privacy safeguards is achievable with existing technology.For example, cell phone carriers could encrypt their lawful intercept records so that neither the carriers themselves nor any single government agency can decrypt them. These records would be useless to malicious insiders at the carriers or hackers who might compromise the carriers' networks, mitigating one valid reason carriers don't want to hold this hot potato. Records could be ""unlocked"" only when independent agencies representing all three branches of government coordinate, e.g., when an intelligence agency electronically requests a warrant, a judge digitally signs it, and a legislative oversight agency digitally attests that the warrant has been tallied in statistics reported to Congress. This electronic coordination need not be slow; the process could occur within seconds of the judge's signing the warrant.With privacy-preserving set intersection, an agency need not have a name or phone number to request a warrant. For example, the FBI could have issued a ""John Doe"" warrant merely listing the cell tower dumps of interest in the High Country Bandits case. The judge authorizing this warrant could limit its scope by specifying a threshold number of these dumps that a phone number must appear in before that phone number can be decrypted and revealed to the FBI. The judge could also specify the maximum number of phone numbers that the warrant may reveal. If, for example, the three requested cell tower dumps unexpectedly coincided with three Justin Bieber concerts, then the warrant might net the phone numbers of thousands of innocent regular teenage fans without yielding useful intelligence. In this case, the set-intersection process would abort without revealing any phone numbers, protecting the fans and requiring the FBI agent to request different cell tower dumps or otherwise narrow the search.Recent breakthroughs may soon make it practical to perform any computation on encrypted data. Currently, the use of encrypted input data may impose some performance cost, but often such costs are not show stoppers for intelligence agencies following targeted leads. And the costs are falling: DARPA is funding a major effort in computing on encrypted data as part of its PROCEED program.The NSA is a major employer of cryptographers and computer-security experts. If the US government had directed the agency to work with the broader security-research community on proper application of privacy-preserving technology for warrant-based surveillance, instead of directing it to hoard cell phone metadata of U.S. citizens, a giant and still-ongoing controversy might have been avoided. It is not too late to begin such a collaboration, but that window of opportunity may be closing."

(Photo by ChinaFotoPress/ChinaFotoPress via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb459072100000001c7fe87.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Regardless of the depths of one's personal investment in the current crop of superhero movies, it's hard to deny the level of ambition put forth by Marvel in the curating of their ever-developing cinematic universe. With a brilliantly orchestrated series of films that led up to last summer's crossover blockbuster The Avengers, and a subsequent slew of motion picture and television endeavors that followed, the scope of Marvel's franchised fandom has never quite been attempted in cinema history. Furthermore, by recruiting celebrated genre filmmakers and writers such as Joss Whedon, James Gunn and Anthony and Joe Russo to develop and helm the projects, Marvel has ensured the films weren't just filler blockbusters, but full-fledged events that left fans clamoring for more. Now, with the recent release of Captain America: Winter Solider (directed by the aforementioned Russos), audiences have been treated to another celebrated thrill ride, and the film's titular hero gets to mosey off into the box office sunset with all the glory. It's Cap's second film outing outside of The Avengers, and it's the most hyped of the films to date. Of course, Captain America is in good company with his teammates. In addition to their joint effort, most of the members of The Avengers have had the chance to shine in their own silver screen adventures, some more than once. Iron Man has a trilogy of films to his name, two each for Thor and Captain America, and while technically the freshman novice, The Hulk has seen his share of TV and film screen time. However, despite the continued solo adventures of the Avengers, the team's sole female member, Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow, continues to not be represented in her own adventure. Now, before we go further, I know there will be some nitpickers out there that are saying, ""Yeah, but Hawkeye doesn't have his own movie, either!"" While this is absolutely true, and I would never discount the sassy archer, I think it's significant that we focus on the fact that Black Widow is continuously second fiddle for the sheer reason that when it comes to superhero, action/adventure stories, this is a road block we keep hitting. It's the same reason DC keeps pumping out cinematic reboots of Batman and Superman every few years, but no one can seem to get Wonder Woman onto the big screen: Despite the fact that we're given some amazing female heroes, for some reason the higher ups don't seem to think we want them. ... and that's pretty insulting. When I started considering the fact that most of the guys in the Avengers had made it into multiple movies, but Black Widow was still on the outside looking in, I had an indignant moment where I thought to myself, ""Why isn't anyone talking about this?"" But, a quick Google search was enough to reveal it was definitely on the minds of the community. I saw some amazing articles from the likes of Rob Keyes on ScreenRant and Frankie Koelle at Bam! Smack! Pow!, who both share my assessment that the lady needs her due. Normally, this would be enough for me to say, ""Other people have this covered,"" and I'd move onward. However, this is one of those issues that I think is important to add as many voices to the discussion as possible, because I continue to see that studios aren't quite hearing our cries. At the Academy Awards this year, when Cate Blanchett made a furtive plea to the industry to recognize that female driven films do sell tickets, many people applauded her calling out the misogynist notion that audiences don't want to see movies centered around women. It's a thought process that continues to prevail in Hollywood, but time and again, we see it being proven wrong when the box office returns come back. Strong women make for compelling cinema, and there's a reason Meryl Streep continues to command audiences while many of her male contemporaries have faded into the background. So, why is it so hard to believe that audiences want to see a movie about a female superhero? To paraphrase Sally Field: We do. We really, really do. When I was a little kid watching cartoons and reading comics, I was always crestfallen to discover that when it came time to buy the toys for the properties I loved, the girl characters were always underrepresented. Now, I know some among you who know my background will think, ""Well, of course the little gay boy wanted the girl toys."" But, honestly, my commitment to the super-heroines always had less to do with my orientation and more to do with fairness. I was raised in a home to believe that women were strong, capable, and equal... because it's true. Therefore, to me, the X-Men weren't the X-Men without Rogue and Storm, because they were as much a part of the team as the boys. It used to make me mad that the action figures of the girls were limited or not made at all, because how could you have a complete team without all the members present? Ultimately, that's really the issue with Black Widow's lack of solo film. While her character plays integral roles in the movies of several of her male counterparts, she's still relegated to secondary status. In the big, bad superhero boy's club, she's still just the girl. Frankly, if I was a young female fan growing up with this, I'd have a hard time wanting to know why the boys always got the spotlight. Heck, I'm not a girl and I'm still asking that question. Usually, this would be the point in the discussion where, as a screenwriter who is still trying to make a name for myself, I would brashly declare, ""Someone needs to write this movie, and that someone should be me!"" But, I think the female superhero solo film needs to extend beyond the camera, too. I think Black Widow needs the superhero movie that we've been lacking: The one that says sisters CAN do it for themselves, and maybe even do it better. If Marvel is going to court such amazing fanboy fare as Joss Whedon and James Gunn for the guys, why not get lady geek gurus like Marti Noxon, Diablo Cody or Felicia Day to pen this script? Heck, think bigger: Can you imagine Black Widow: A Kathryn Bigelow film? I can. It's glorious. Here's the bottom line: Today, I went to the store, and I saw Scarlett Johansson on the cover of no less than four current magazines. If you think living in a society where this amazing actress is good enough to be a sex symbol, but not a strong, independent action star is okay, then perhaps you need to reassess what you get out of going to the movies. For her part, Johansson has joined the chorus of fans in declaring she thinks Black Widow deserves her own movie, and I'm hoping people are listening. This is your moment, Marvel. Take Black Widow's lack of movie, and let that absence be avenged."

Foster, III/Charlotte Observer/MCT via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb75511240000500056fe4e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Before the start of the season and even through the first quarter of games played, the outcome of the Eastern Conference playoffs seemed predetermined: the Indiana Pacers would square off against the Miami Heat for a spot in the NBA Finals. Now, with the Pacers in rapid decline and the Heat sliding not far behind, anything seems possible. Check that: almost anything (sorry, Charlotte). With hopes of early upsets, here are my picks for the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs.#1 Indiana Pacers vs. #8 Atlanta HawksThe Atlanta Hawks have a better offense than the Pacers? Yes, yes they do.Atlanta used that somehow-superior offense to embarrass the Pacers on April 6th, beating them by 19. I'm hard-pressed to pick an eighth seed over a one -- especially this eighth seed, a team that lost it's best player, Al Horford, in December to a torn pectoral muscle and whose own general manager, Danny Ferry, said that he didn't care if the team made the playoffs or not. That being said, the Hawks do pose a matchup problem for the Pacers -- specifically Roy Hibbert's inability to guard center-ish Hawks big man, Pero Antic. I'm not completely comfortable pegging this thirty-something year-old Macedonian rookie as a potential ""difference maker"" in this series, but Pero has torched the Pacers this year.With Roy reluctant to meet him on the perimeter, Pero shot a staggering 72 percent from the field, 60 percent behind the arc and averaged 17 points per game in two Hawks wins this season against the Pacers. This is an admittedly small sample size and could definitely just be an aberration. For the season, Pero averaged 7 points and shot a pedestrian 41.8 percent from the floor and 32.7 percent from long range. But I like this guy -- I'm not sure why.Since the NBA changed its first round series from five to seven games in 2003, three eighth seeds have upset the top dog in the first round: Don Nelson's Warriors over Dirk and the Mavs in 2007, Grizzlies over Spurs in 2011 and Philadelphia over a Rose-less Bulls team in 2012. Of those three upsets, I think this Pacers-Hawks matchup most resembles that 2007 Mavericks-Warriors series. The Pacers, like the Mavs of yesteryear, have a yet-unproven star (Paul George and Dirk respectively). Of course Dirk was much more accomplished in 2007 than George is now, since Dirk actually won the MVP award in '07 while George was merely an early season third-place candidate for the award at best.But my point is that George is not a reliable star (don't forget Dirk choked the year before in the Finals after going up 2-0 against the Heat and then followed that up with a subpar postseason series against the Warriors in which the Mavericks were the first one seed to lose to an eighth seed since the first round changed to seven games).And just as the Hawks stretch the Pacers out -- drawing Hibbert and David West out of the paint to guard Pero and Paul Millsap on the perimeter -- so too did the Mavs face a match-up nightmare in Golden State. The 2007 Warriors, coached by Don Nelson, were ahead of their time. Nelson favored smaller, quicker lineups, shunning the conventional wisdom that any good team had to feature a back-to-the-basket big. Nelson encouraged his players to take the first good look they had which led to a lot of field goal attempts early in the shot clock often from downtown. Of course, this Hawks team lacks the swagger (what's a good synonym for swagger? I'm not a fan) which defined that 2007 Warrior team - a group of players that no other team wanted and who were brought together by Nelson, the mad scientist, who encouraged them to be their purest and baddest selves. And the 2011 Hawks are nowhere near as talented as '07 Warriors. Yes, Paul Millsap earned his first All-Star appearance this season and Pero is a real problem for Roy, not to mention the lights-out shooting of Kyle ""Ashton Kutcher"" Korver giving the Pacers fits and the improved play of Jeff Teague... wait, the more I write, the more I am convinced. Alright, I'm in Hawks. You can all laugh at me later when they get swept or hail me as a prophet. Pacers's top-ranked defense be damned! Atlanta in seven! #2 Miami Heat vs. #7 Charlotte BobcatsHeat in five. Wah-wah. When the Heat want to be the best defensive team in the league, they flip that proverbial switch and send teams packing quickly, especially in the first round. Kemba Walker, though it breaks my Hungry Husky Heart to say it, is an average NBA point guard (which, in truth, is not really an insult considering the quality at that position in the league today). He's not a great shooter -- he's below 40% from the field -- and the Mario Chalmers/Noris Cole combo should play him to a relative standstill. Yes, Big Al Jefferson can dominate the interior offensively, but he's also a kitchen-door defender. Which is a problem because the other team has Lebron James and a well-rested Dwayne Wade (at his best this season, Wade looks like he's just woken up from one of those perfect two hour naps -- not groggy, just ready to attack the day). And just for good measure, the Heat have Chris Bosh -- a player that would be the go-to guy on that Bobcats -- as a third option. The Bobcats will steal one on their home floor and after which we can finally, mercifully lay the Bobcats nickname to rest forever; amen. #3 Toronto Raptors vs. #6 #6 Brooklyn NetsThis might be the most intriguing matchup of the first round in the Eastern Conference. I've gone back and forth on this one, but I like the Nets in six.  Jason Kidd, to his credit, righted the ship after a shaky start to the season. After losing Brook Lopez, Kidd adapted his lineups and game plan to fit his personal, starting Shaun Livingston - who has been a revelation -- benching Derron ""Horrible Hairline"" Williams and utilizing Paul Pierce as a stretch-four (a progressive move reminiscent of how Kidd's former coach, Mike Woodson, changed Carmelo Anthony's role in 2013). So often NBA coaches are rigid seemingly for no good reason (Scottie Brooks and Marc Jackson, come on bros). It's refreshing to see a new head coach as unflappable and as open-minded as Kidd.The biggest question for the Nets is Garnett. KG has averaged 20.5 minutes in 54 games this season. Put another way, he's missed over a third of the season and in the games that he actually got on the court, he was only out there for less than a half of the game. Considering the way Jason Kidd's career ended - forty-years old, exhausted and having no legs under him from having played too many minutes earlier in the season, Kidd shot 0 for 17 over his last ten playoff games and limped off into the sunset. Perhaps Kidd had KG on the Duncan plan so that he would be fresh for the games that really matter. Or maybe KG just can't play any more than 20-plus minutes at this point in his career. The answer to that question will influence how far Brooklyn can go in these playoffs.#4 Chicago Bulls vs. #5 Washington WizardsBulls coach Tom Thibodeau is one lonely dude, or so I imagine. He's 56, he doesn't have a wife or kids -- really any family to speak of -- which leaves him with plenty of free time to design defensive schemes as maniacal as his laugh. For that reason alone, I'm taking the Bulls over the Wiz in six -- but I'm not happy about it. I want the Wizards to win: they're a more entertaining team largely because of their fourth year point guard, John Wall. Wall has developed a consistent outside shot to compliment his freakish end-to-end speed. And he's playing with great pace this season. In years past, he only had one gear, but this year he's learned how to shift down in order to read the defense and make the best play rather than barreling headlong toward the rim without a plan. I would love Wall to prove me wrong and emerge as the star of these playoffs, but I don't know if he has enough help to make it happen. Plus, the Bulls have an advantage in the frontcourt (even with Boozer? You ask, and I, ashamed, shake my head yes). The trio of Joakim Noah - my choice for Defensive Player of the Year - Taj Gibson and and the Booze Cruise should outplay the Wizards line of ""Fragile, Do Not Shake"" Nene, the ne'er-defend-well Marcin Gortat and Drew Gooden who I hear is having a good season, but I refuse to believe it. The fact that the Bulls are a four seed with D.J. ""Chubby Gopher"" Augustin as their -- wait, what? -- LEADING SCORER upsets me deeply. Augustin's improved play is proof enough that Thibodeau is so deeply bored and deeply evil that he has the time and the pathological yearning to create a system in which the chubbiest of gophers can thrive as an NBA point guard."

Instead, she sees the ugly face of homophobia and transphobia that continues to stain Jamaica's image.  In her documentary Taboo...Yardies, Blake presents footage compiled over the course of six years, including interviews with those on both sides of the LGBT rights debate, to investigate what TIME magazine has suggested is ""the most homophobic place on earth."" The evidence is abundant from last year's gruesome murder of gender non-conforming teen, Dwayne Jones to the popular homophobic dancehall lyrics of stars like Buju Banton, Elephant Man and Bounty Killer. Courtesy: MayNov Productions  Blake, who identifies as heterosexual, captures the survival skills that many within the LGBT community employ to stay alive.Many LGBTQ Jamaicans try to blend in as much as possible and don't trust anyone outside the community unless persons in the community gives the green light. In some cases, should their sexual orientation be revealed they have to lie to ensure their safety and the safety of their families.For Blake, Jamaica remains a country bound by the chains of colonialism and slavery. After nearly 52 years of independence from Britain, the island still maintains laws from the colonial era that criminalize the LGBT population. The Offences Against Persons Act of 1864, frequently referred to as the ""buggery"" laws makes homosexuality punishable up to 10 years' imprisonment. Despite current prime minister Portia Simpson Miller's promise to address these discriminatory laws, nothing has changed. ""Our lawmakers are suffering from deep rooted mental slavery, afraid to do the right thing and amend these laws and change the narrative moving forward for our people,"" said Blake.  Still there is hope. Blake finds it in the formation of organizations like Quality of Citizenship Jamaica (QCJ), which provides grassroots support for the LBGT community. Plus, she is currently mobilizing a group of activists to join her ""United for Change"" campaign and plans a sequel to the documentary. In the meantime, the film is scheduled for a four-day run at the Faison Firehouse Theater in New York City beginning May 1.

The Tony Award winner has a new CD of Broadway standards titled, Billy's Back on Broadway.Thematically, Porter chose songs that reflect empowerment and perseverance such as ""Don't Rain on My Parade,"" from ""Funny Girl,"" and ""I Am Changing,"" from Dreamgirls. The song selection mirrors Porter's revived career and outlook on life.  After ascending to glory in the theatre world in the 1990s and releasing a major label album, he began to feel uncomfortable with music industry politics and decided to leave and figure out his place in the entertainment industry. There was a time in the '90s where as an African-American man you had to be a misogynistic R&B star or a rapper and I didn't fit into either one of those. I was advised by my label to remain closeted at that time.It would take Porter 13 years and a push from his current manager, Lisa Barbaris, to consider a return to the music business. Porter recalled that while in rehearsals for the hit musical Kinky Boots, Barbaris suggested that he consider recording an album despite his resistance to the idea. I was just so burned in the '90s and not interested in reentering a world where I would have to compromise myself and specifically my sexuality. Lisa assured me that the market and music business changed. She really fought for me and fought for this deal. It was interesting because 20 years ago when I tried to do a Broadway album they laughed me out the room. Billy Porter/Credit: John GanunBut now Porter is the one with the last and perhaps, most infectious, laugh in the room. It is the confident laughter of a man who has come to accept himself and refuses to allow the joke to be on him. In those 13 years, I was able to really come to terms with what my truth is for me. My truth is I am gay and out and if I can't do that in my music, then I don't need it. Fortunately I do feel like there is a movement against homophobia and I hope to be part of that._____  The weekly column, On the ""A"" w/Souleo, covers the intersection of the arts, culture entertainment and philanthropy in Harlem and beyond and is written by Souleo, founder and president of event/media content production company, Souleo Enterprises, LLC."

And everyday people responded, they organised and they overcame the odds. I see the same thing happening in Britain.""Centre-left Labour lost power in 2010 when Cameron's Conservatives formed a coalition government with the smaller Liberal Democratic Party.His government brought in deep spending cuts as part of austerity measures which it argued was necessary to repair the damage caused by Labour's mishandling of the economy.After criticising the austerity programme last year when Britain's economy looked at risk of a triple-dip recession, the International Monetary Fund this month raised the country's growth forecasts more than for any other major economy.Axelrod will fly to London next month for two days of meetings with Miliband and his campaign team, the party said.Senior figures from his consultancy firm AKPD, who also worked on Obama's campaigns, will then become an integral part of Labour's election team alongside strategy head Douglas Alexander.""In his work for President Obama, David helped shape a campaign that reflected his vision, focused on building an economy that works for all hardworking people and not just a privileged few,"" Miliband said.""He will be a huge asset to our campaign,"" he said.Last August the Conservatives themselves hired Obama's former campaign manager Jim Messina, a lifelong Democrat, to offer strategic advice to their campaign team which also includes Australian election strategist Lynton Crosby.

In the next few months, Hollywood will break out the big guns with sequels to major franchises like The Amazing Spider-Man 2, reboots like Transformers: Age of Extinction and many more. While other genres like comedies and animation bring moviegoers to their seats, year after year, it is the action genre that has the biggest draw and rakes in the most money for the studios. A key part of the action movie genre is the stunts. Whether it is jumping out of a building or an intense car chase, these stunts are the ""action"" in action movies. It takes a long time to coordinate and plan these stunts. Once they are coordinated the stunt professionals' then risk, body and sometimes their lives to perform the stunt safely and effectively.Besides a great script/cast, many technical aspects are needed to create the magic the moviegoer sees on screen. Some of these technical aspects include costumes, make-up, sound, and of course stunts. Almost all these important pieces are recognized by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (or just the Academy) with categories at the Oscars. Unfortunately stunts, stunt-work, or more specifically the coordinators of these stunts continue to not be recognized by the Academy (Since stunt ensembles can sometimes be very large, members of this community are pushing for the ""Best Stunt Coordinator"" category). The push for the creation of the ""Best Stunt Coordinator"" Oscar is not new. It was spearheaded by Jack Gill, legendary stuntman, who has been active in the industry for decades and has well over 150 stunt credits to his name. Gill has proposed a category for ""Best Stunt Coordinator"" since the early 90s (and he is not giving up). A category needs to be added, so naturally people can be nominated. If the Academy felt that one particular stunt coordinator did a great job on a particular film, he or she could not be considered because there is not a category. Why the Academy does not recognize these people is unclear. For some there is still the idea that members of the movie industry do not want the stunt professionals to be recognized because it would shine a light on the fact many actors/actresses do not do their own stunts. However, this is idea is irrelevant to the ""Best Stunt Coordinator"" category. Even if they did their own stunts, I am willing to bet that they did not coordinate the stunt or stunts in question and were directed by a stunt coordinator on how to pull it off. This is in fact the second time I wrote about this topic in the Huffington Post. The first time was in January 2013 and was called ""Is There a Category Missing at the Academy Awards?"" Before this, I remembered reading an article about Jack Gill and his pursuit for this category. At the time I felt that there was something wrong with not including these hardworking men and women with their own category. My passion for this has not changed. In fact, it has been amplified. After sending the original article to the Stunt Association of Motion Pictures, a stuntman by the name of Brady Romberg contacted me to say how much he liked the article. That September, I re-contacted with him and after some talking, I starting working with him on various projects. To be clear, I still currently live in Pennsylvania so this opportunity surprised many, including myself. Also (for transparency sake) Brady had zero idea that I was planning on writing another article this topic until I made him aware the other day. Regardless, I found that many outside the industry were unaware (possible due to the lack of media attention) that stunt performers were not recognized by the biggest film award ceremony in the World. Friends and family of mine were surprised and like me confused by this. In an industry where action films make billions, it just does not make any sense why an essential piece of the film-making puzzle would not be recognized.There is currently a petition circulating (started by Amber Gallaway, wife of stuntman Patrick Gallaway) asking people to sign and ""Stand Up For Stunts."" Each year the Academy board members vote on various things (with, like previous years, the proposal of this category by Gill on the itinerary). Hopefully the Academy will do the right thing and give a category for ""Best Stunt Coordinator."" It is about time these hard working men and women get the recognition they deserve."
10,RELIGION,Is Jesus' Message His Death or His Life?,"Reverend Dr. Malcolm Clemens Young, ContributorDean of Grace Cathedral, San Francisco",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-jesus-message-his-deat_b_5168607.html,"Holy Week should not be interpreted to mean that we are responsible for the death of Christ, or that God's honor would be offended if he simply forgave our sins, or that the point of Jesus' life was his suffering and death, or that this death magically erases the consequences of what we actually have done.",2014-04-18,2014-04-17-770pxStJohnsAshfield_StainedGlass_GoodShepherd_Portrait.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-04-17-770pxStJohnsAshfield_StainedGlass_GoodShepherd_Portrait-thumb.jpg," This week one billion people will remember the last days of Jesus' life -- his final meal with his friends on Maundy Thursday, his death on Good Friday and his resurrection on Easter. Christians disagree on the question of whether Jesus' life and teaching are more important, or whether it is his death that most sets him apart.Summarizing the Christian message the apostle Paul writes, ""Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures"" (1 Cor. 5:3). But making this connection between Jesus and the prophets of the Hebrew Scriptures still does not explain how salvation happens.Before the year one thousand Christians did not write very much, or think much about how it is that Christ saves us. Before then they described Jesus as tricking Satan out of the Christians in his possession.Anselm of Canterbury (1033-1109) one of the most brilliant theologians in the church took on this challenge in a short, hastily written treatise called ""Why God Became Human (""Cur Deus Homo, 1098). Anselm's argument depends on a metaphor. He describes the relation between human beings and God as parallel to the relation between a feudal serf and the lord to whom he owes total obedience. Anselm goes on to write that through our sins we have offended God's honor. We cannot repay the debt ourselves. The rational order of the universe means that God cannot simply look the other way. The only solution for this double bind is for God's son to suffer in our place.To be clear, for a thousand years in the western church and for two thousand years in the Eastern church, Christians did not use this explanation. I believe on this point that Anselm and those who follow him are mistaken. Anselm's account shifts the focus of Jesus' ministry from what he did, how he healed and taught, to his suffering.You can see this change in artistic depictions of Jesus. Before the end of the thirteenth century Christ was usually depicted as the peaceful Good Shepherd or as the divine majesty. But from this point his image began to appear more frequently with his body broken on the cross and his face distorted in pain. Holy Week should not be interpreted to mean that we are responsible for the death of Christ, or that God's honor would be offended if he simply forgave our sins, or that the point of Jesus' life was his suffering and death, or that this death magically erases the consequences of what we actually have done.If Holy Week does not mean this, what does it mean? It means two things. First, you cannot ignore or get around suffering. The other day a friend told me how much her mother hated funerals. She dealt with death by simply not thinking about it. For Christians this is not a serious option. Unlike my atheist friends who feel so offended by suffering that they cannot believe in God, we experience God as our hope in the face of our suffering. Second the events of this week mean that we have a responsibility for alleviating suffering in the world, to be agents of healing and reconciliation.Paul also writes, ""Let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus, who... emptied himself, taking the form of a slave, being born in human likeness"" (Philippians 3). Christians need to empty ourselves of ourselves in the way that Jesus does. We need to be like our teacher in his humility.Humility does not mean saying that you are bad at tennis when you are really pretty good at it. Humility means seeing your self in the way that others see you. Humility means getting out of our own way, and doing what love requires of us.Last week I met a woman named Tracy. Twelve years ago on the week before her wedding date her fiancé had a massive stroke that left him completely paralyzed except for one hand. She cancelled the big wedding. They exchanged vows in the Intensive Care Unit instead. She had made a promise. Despite being universally discouraged by all of her friends, she understood that breaking the promise would not leave her any happier. There have been hard times as there are in any marriage, but the two just celebrated their twelfth anniversary.The word vocation is derived from the Latin word vocare. It means calling. It is the work God asks us to do. Holy Week is when we celebrate Jesus' unique calling as teacher, healer and God's son. It is a time when we ask ourselves again what God is calling us to do."
