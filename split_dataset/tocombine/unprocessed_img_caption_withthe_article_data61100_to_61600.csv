The pop star posted a pic of his bare bum on Instagram this weekend. In the photo, Bieber is turned away from the camera and stands on the edge of a lake, fully exposed for all his followers. ""Dat ass doe,"" he captioned the photo, presumably snapped somewhere in California, as Bieber is set to hit San Diego on the next stop of his Purpose Tour. It looks like Bieber has ventured into the wild during a break between tour dates as he also posted a picture of himself sleeping outside in nature. After canceling meet and greets for the remainder of the tour because they leave him depressed, perhaps Mother Nature is the only one that can rejuvenate Bieber's spirit. The tide has apparently turned since Bieber told his 63 million followers in 2015 that he would refrain from posting any nude photos out of respect for his young fan base. After sharing a naked pic of himself on a boat last July, he deleted the post and took to Instagram to say sorry. ""Deleted the photo of my butt on Instagram not because I thought it was bad but someone close to me's daughter follows me,"" he captioned the photo. ""Didn't take in account there are littles following me!!!""But as all Beliebers are aware, NEVER SAY NEVER. "

Ditching her favorite Bulls jersey for the Knicks' blue and orange, Cyrus rocked some new blond bangs and, of course, her engagement ring.Miley made her night out a family affair, with sister Brandi and mom Tish in tow. Though Brandi opted to wear a Cleveland Cavaliers jersey, that didn't stop the Cyrus sisters from having a seriously good time courtside. Miley even scored a pic with the Cavaliers' shooting guard, J.R. Smith, who later hugged her and posed for a photo with the rest of her family. If Miley expected to sit front row at a basketball game and not be noticed, the operators of the Jumbotron had another idea in mind. At one point, the cameras plastered her smiling mug on the big screen, making Miley ""embarrassed of all embarrassed."" She documented the moment on Instagram after the game, as well as sharing a Cyrus family photo. A source close to the singer and actress confirmed her (re)engagement to actor Liam Hemsworth in January, but she has yet to make an official statement about her reunion with the ""Hunger Games"" star. The two first started dating during the filming of ""The Last Song"" in 2009 and announced their engagement three years later. But things took a turn for the worse in 2013, bringing what seemed like the end of the Miley and Liam love story.However, until their yet-to-be-announced nuptials, Miley is just a free woman with a pulse and therefore incapable of not being in awe of Cavaliers star LeBron James. According to Brandi, both Cyrus sisters couldn't help but admire his talents from the sidelines. We're right there with you, Miley. "

After explaining just how many followers he has on Twitter and Instagram -- and applauding both for being effective mediums of communication -- he said he’d tone it down in the Oval. “I'm not going to be doing it very much as president,” Trump said. “I will say, uh, you know, I will -- I will act in the best interests of our country. I will act to protect our country, whether that's counterpunching or not.”Notice, this wasn’t a pledge to never tweet, just one to not do it “very much.”The catalyst for the conversation was a tweet that circulated last week: It showed an unflattering photo of Sen. Ted Cruz’s wife, Heidi, next to a picture of Trump’s wife, Melania. Trump explained that he had merely re-tweeted the photo and not generated it himself, which is a fairly well-established social media defense. And he also argued that a super PAC ad shaming Melania for a GQ photo shoot she did many years ago was a far worse offense.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Children often bemoan waiting to grow up, and at some point adults begin to dig in their heels and attempt to freeze the process. Aesthetics are at the root of America's anti-aging myth. The myth that by maintaining a certain physical appearance one can stop the aging process. Striving for and clinging to an ideal physical appearance is pervasive in American culture. How does this myth exist when every single day of one's life our appearance is shifting, we are aging? What if this shifting was not seen as growth OR deterioration? What if this shifting was accepted without judgment? What if this shifting was simply witnessed without an attempt to control? The process of aging is universal; the lived qualities of it are unique to the individual. This uniqueness offers us a chance to appreciate the aging process artfully.  Ora by Claudia Biçen thoughtsinpassing.com It is not simply that our physical and even mental abilities as well as our hold on life are dwindling; though that is indeed the case, something else is developing in concert with these losses. . . . The body forces on us a kind of maturity, a settling down into a grounded encounter with reality, and, if we are paying attention, of limited potential. -- Jungian Analyst Cynde Rothe Aging shifts our aesthetic. If this shift can be embraced -- or dare I say valued -- we can develop an acceptance of our own process and an appreciation for those who have gone through it before. We are good at this in childhood: we look to those older than us and see when they grew and wonder when our growth spurt will come, we anxiously await the changes puberty will bring. I propose that this same wonder and curiosity can be used throughout our life.  Gurmeet by Claudia Biçen claudiabicen.com I expose the illusion that youth is perfect. Youth is beautiful in many ways, but it's not perfect. The problem with thinking youth is perfect is that everything that follows must therefore be in decline. It's dangerous to let go of what's familiar, to let go of what you've always done, to choose to do something new that you might or might not succeed at. We grow and change and develop across the entire lifespan, not just when we are young. -- Dr. Bill Thomas I have tried to embody this concept with an experiment on myself. When I became involved in the fight against ageism I did not yet have my first gray hair. I decided to try to shift my perspective and to view gray hair the way I had awaited the changes in puberty, and as with my own puberty, I had to wait longer than most of my peers for this change. Just a few weeks ago I noticed my first gray and some of its friends near my hairline. I was pleased to notice that my internal dialogue was much the same as it was in reaction to physical changes I experienced earlier in life. I looked at it, noticed the difference in texture from my other hairs, how it glistened silver. I am curious how fast I will go gray and in what pattern. No part of me wanted to pluck or dye these sweet early messengers of elderhood. I look forward to the honor of being a crone and these little hairs are the first physical manifestation of my journey. I am not trying to Pollyanna the aging process. Life is hard and fraught with suffering. I am arguing that we do not need to add to that suffering by judging ourselves for aging or believing that we can only be beautiful for a few years of our lives.  Zephyr by Aleah Chapin aleahchapin.comThe key to aging with grace and comfort is finding that internal dialogue that encourages you as you would encourage a good friend and makes you feel like attractiveness isn't about having every feature look the same as it did years ago. It's about focusing on the whole gestalt--your presentation of yourself, your smile, your engaging eyes, a strong stride. That goes along with a dialogue that says, ""Life requires a constant adjusting."" -- Ex-model and Psychologist Vivian DillerWhat if our culture did not see the shifting aesthetics after early adulthood as a move toward obsolescence? Psychologist James Hillman elaborated on this idea by saying, ""Perhaps uselessness needs to be regarded aesthetically [emphasis added]. . . . The old become strikingly memorable, ancestral representations, characters in the play of civilization, each a unique, irreplaceable figure of value. Aging: an art form?"" To turn this type of appreciation back on one's own life (or that of a loved one), to view one's character as her or his own personal masterpiece of soul art is a significant act of caring for soul.

16,WORLDPOST,The Battle for Mosul and the Future of Islamic State,"Joseph V. Micallef, ContributorBest Selling Military History and World Affairs Author and Key...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-battle-for-mosul-and_b_9553010.html,,2016-03-27,2016-03-27-1459086474-3929516-MosulIslamic_State_IS_insurgents_Anbar_Province_Iraq.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-03-27-1459086474-3929516-MosulIslamic_State_IS_insurgents_Anbar_Province_Iraq-thumb.jpg," Islamic State Militants in Anbar Province On March 24, the Baghdad government announced that it was commencing military operations to retake the city of Mosul from Islamic State. The predominantly Sunni Muslim city, the second largest overall in Iraq and the largest urban area controlled by the Islamic State, has a prewar population of approximately two million people. The announcement did not come as a surprise and was consistent with Iraqi military operations already underway in Makhmur, in Ninevah province, to cut off Islamic State positions in a pocket surrounding the town of Hawija. At this point, it is unclear whether Iraqi forces are planning to surround Hawija and then bypass it, or whether they plan to take control of the town and the surrounding region prior to commencing operations directly against Mosul. The Iraqi advance coincided with new offensives by the Syrian Army east of Homs to retake the cities of Al-Quaryatayn and Palmyra. The latter includes the archeological site containing the ruins of the ancient city of Palmyra. By March 26, Syrian military forces were advancing into the city and had taken control of the western and northern parts of the city and were in full control of the al-Amiriya district on the northern edge of Palmyra. The city also sits astride the road from Damascus to the IS held eastern city of Deir ez-Zur. (Update: on March 27th, the Assad government announced that Islamic State militants had withdrawn from the city and that Syrian troops were now in control of Palmyra.)In the meantime, troops from the U.S. backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) were within 20 miles of the Islamic State's capital of Raqqa. The SDF is comprised of troops from the Kurdish YPG and YPJ military forces along with Sunni Arab and Christian militias. In a broad pincer movement one column of SDF forces advanced from the recently captured village of Ash Shaddadi directly east while a second column advanced from the town of Suluk directly north of Raqqa. The advance cut off a roughly 4,000 square mile area to the northeast from the Islamic State capital.To the south, the New Syrian Army, another group backed by the U.S. and the Saudi led Gulf Cooperation Council, had begun a new offensive to seize control of Deir ez-Zur in the northwest. Also significant, another group of Syrian rebels have advanced to within six miles of the town of Dabiq, while Syrian government forces are advancing on Dabiq from Al-Bab in the southeast and SDF forces are advancing from Manbij in the east. The town is situated 30 miles to the northeast of Aleppo and holds particular ideological significance to the Islamic State. Dabiq was mentioned in a hadith, a ""verified comment"" by the Prophet Muhammad, as the location where an apocalyptic battle would occur between Muslims and infidels involving ""all the armies of the world"" that would usher in ""the end of days."" In the confrontation, the prophet Isa (Jesus) would appear to lead the Islamic forces over their infidel opponents ensuring the final victory for the ""true believers."" This prophecy is at the core of the Islamic State's apocalyptic vision of how Islam will triumph and come to rule in a worldwide caliphate.The Islamic State has named its glossy propaganda magazine Dabiq, and each issue prominently features the quote from Abu Musab Zarqawi, ""The spark has been lit here in Iraq and its heat will continue to intensify -- by Allah's permission -- until it burns the crusader armies in Dabiq.""The fall of Mosul would be a critical loss for the Islamic State. The outcome of the Iraqi campaign to take it will be long and difficult, however, and success is in no way assured. There are three crucial elements that will dictate the likelihood of success of the operation to take Mosul: the military campaign itself, the political issues surrounding the campaign and how IS will respond both within Iraq and abroad.The military aspect of the campaign is relatively straightforward. Kurdish Peshmerga forces have surrounded Mosul from the north, east and west. With the capture of Tal Afar, all of the major highways leading to the north, east and west, highways 47, 1, 2 and 3 have all been cut off. Highway 1 to the south, from Mosul as far as Baiji, is still more or less in the hands of IS, as are portions of Highway 80 immediately around Mosul as far as the juncture with Highway 3. Current Iraqi military operations in Makhmur, and eventually al Qayyarah to the west, combined with an Iraqi drive up Highway 1 from Baiji, would finish the encirclement of Mosul. Although some secondary roads would remain open, they would not allow much access to additional IS supplies or military forces in Syria.Based on the prior experience with the recapture of Tikrit and Ramadi, the liberation of Mosul is likely to see a prolonged urban campaign characterized by protracted street-to-street fighting with liberal use of IEDs and booby traps as well as the use of tunnels to strike unexpectedly at the rear of advancing Iraqi troops. While close air support and the use of precision munitions to target IS strongpoints will give the advancing Iraqi army a significant advantage, the campaign will likely be long and difficult and will take, at the very least, the better part of 2016 and will likely extend into 2017. Moreover, there is a significant civilian population still in Mosul. As of February 4, 2016, it was estimated that there were still 700,000 civilians in the city. By comparison there were hardly any civilians left in Tikrit and only about 4,000 in Ramadi when those campaigns began.According to Iraqi government sources it's estimated that there are approximately 10,000 IS militants still in Mosul. At this point it is still unclear whether Islamic State will withdraw any of those fighters in anticipation of the attack on Mosul. Originally Baghdad estimated that it would need approximately 24,000 soldiers to recapture the city. Pentagon sources placed the number at close to 40,000. Both numbers may turn out to be to low, however. By comparison, Tikrit was held by around 1,000 IS militants and Ramadi by approximately 2,000 militants. The Tikrit campaign took two months and the Ramadi campaign close to four months before each city was effectively secured. In the Tikrit campaign, Iraqi forces had a better that ten to one advantage over IS militants, although the Iraqi forces were made up primarily of poorly trained Shia militias. In the case of Ramadi, the Iraqi force was made up primarily of regular Iraqi Army units and Iraqi Special Forces, but here again they enjoyed a better than five to one numerical advantage. The political issues surrounding the Mosul campaign will weigh heavily on the likelihood of success there. Historically the city of Mosul was predominantly Kurdish. The city and the surrounding region had traditionally been considered part of Anatolia rather than Mesopotamia. It was a separate province (vilayet) under the Ottomans from the two provinces (Baghdad Vilayet and Basra Vilayet) that made up the historic region of Mesopotamia. Under the Armistice of Mudros, between Great Britain and the Ottoman Empire, Mosul was to have remained part of Turkish Anatolia as the region was still controlled by the Ottomans when the armistice went into effect on October 31, 1918. British forces, however, spurred by the discovery of oil in the region, continued to advance for two more weeks after the ceasefire until they had secured Mosul and the surrounding region.Mosul was part of the northern no fly zone enforced by the U.S. and Britain from 1991 to 2003. During this period, however, the Saddam Hussein government implemented an aggressive policy of ""Arabization"" that saw the government relocate large numbers of Sunni Arabs to the city and in some cases expel some of the non-Arab inhabitants. A significant portion of the senior leadership in the Iraqi Army came from Mosul, a fact that may explain how a significant number of former Baathist military and government officials have come to play a significant role in the administration of the city while it has been under IS control. The Kurdistan regional government in Ebril has previously indicated that it would like to see Mosul included in the Autonomous Kurdistan Region. Such an outcome is highly unlikely, however. The Baghdad government would not want to see its second largest city incorporated into Iraqi Kurdistan. Its historical roots notwithstanding, the city is predominantly Sunni Muslim now. Moreover, it is likely that the city will suffer extensive damage during the military campaign and the tab for rebuilding it will amount to tens of billions of dollars - a sum beyond the means of the currently cash strapped Kurdistan regional government. Disposition of forces in Iraq and Syria as of March, 2016  What role the Kurdish Peshmerga forces will play in the battle for Mosul is unclear. Previously the Kurdistan regional government had announced that Iraqi military forces would not be allowed to enter in or operate from Kurdish territory. Moreover, the Kurdish regional government's financial constraints, and an unwillingness to spill Kurdish blood for what will ultimately be an Iraqi city, also means that the role of the Peshmerga will likely be to hold the current defensive positions to the east, north and west of Mosul, but not otherwise actively participate in the actual advance on the city.The role that the Shia militias will play is also unclear. Previously, those militias and their Iranian sponsors had lobbied for an active role in the Mosul campaign. The Baghdad government has resisted a prominent role for the Shia militias fearing a repeat of the sectarian violence that erupted following the liberation of Tikrit. The situation with those militias is very fluid, however. The current Shia dominated government in Baghdad is badly fractured. A more prominent role for the Shia militias may be the price that the Sadr and other Shia political groups demand for their support of the government. At the moment, Shia militias are actively engaged against Islamic State forces in the desert areas surrounding Samarra, roughly halfway between Baghdad and Tikrit but do not appear to have a significant presence further north. Moreover, if past experience with Islamic State is a guide, an offensive up the Tigris valley against Mosul will likely precipitate attacks by IS militants in the Euphrates Valley, especially in Sunni dominated Anbar province. Indeed the IS seizure of Ramadi in May 2015, was in part prompted by visible signs that Baghdad was readying a campaign up the Tigris Valley toward Mosul. It's unclear, and probably unlikely, that the Iraqi Army has sufficient strength to engage IS militants on both the Euphrates and Tigris fronts. Baghdad will likely have to rely on the Shia militias to deal with any new IS attacks on the cities in the Euphrates Valley. Depending on how extensive those attacks are, and the extent to which Baghdad is dependent on the Shia militias to contain them, may well determine whether those militias can successfully demand a larger role in the Mosul Campaign.Baghdad is relying primarily on the U.S. trained Iraqi Army to lead the advance on Mosul. How effective those forces are going to be, however, remains unanswered. U.S. trained Iraqi Special Forces performed well during the Ramadi Campaign. The ""Golden Battalion,"" the Iraqi 36th Commando Battalion, in particular, has received high praise from U.S. advisors. It is not clear yet whether Iraqi Special Forces are active in the Mosul campaign or are still deployed in mopping up operations around Ramadi.Regular Iraqi forces, however, are still a question mark. There were numerous reports of Iraqi troops fleeing the battlefield during military operations against IS militants in the village of Nasr, south of Mosul, on March 25, when they came under prolonged sniper fire from IS fighters in the village. Adjacent Peshmerga units, most armed only with old Kalashnikovs and lacking the modern equipment of the Iraqi units, held their positions, on the other hand. The same thing had happened a week earlier when Iraqi troops fled their positions defending a newly established U.S. Marines base near Makhmor. The facility, technically a firebase, was manned by 200 Marines from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit. The firebase is supposed to provide artillery support for the Iraqi troops clearing IS militants in the area and for the eventual advance on Mosul as well as to stiffen the resolve of the Iraqi military units, the 15th Division, in the area. One marine was subsequently killed when IS militants were able to approach close enough to the firebase to attack it with mortars. What role Sunni militias will play in the Mosul campaign is also unclear. The U.S. has been urging the Baghdad government to organize and arm a Sunni National Guard, but the Iraqi government continues to be reluctant to do so fearing that such units would become the core of an armed Sunni resistance to Baghdad. Military equipment that the Pentagon has supplied to Iraq to arm a Sunni National Guard has instead gone to Shia National Guard units. The Turkish government has signaled that it sees a role for itself in training and arming Sunni militia units but is does not appear that it has moved to actively do so yet. The likely response of Islamic State to the Mosul campaign will be fourfold. On the Tigris front they will adopt a scorched earth strategy relying heavily of IEDs and other types of booby traps to slow the Iraqi advance while engaging in a protracted street-by-street urban campaign within Mosul itself. In addition, they are likely to deploy insurgency tactics in the rear of the Iraqi forces advancing on Mosul. They are also likely to opportunistically bring pressure on the Euphrates front, especially in Anbar province, to tie up Iraqi troops and Shia militias and divert them from being deployed against Mosul. It is also likely that IS militants will single out captured Iraqi Army Shia soldiers for particularly gruesome executions as a way of reducing the military's morale.  Islamic State's propaganda magazine Dabiq  IS will also likely launch attacks against civilian targets in Baghdad and in the Shia dominated south. Already there are signs that this may be happening. Since February there has been a string of IS launched terrorist attacks in Iraq. These attacks have included two bombs that exploded at a market in Sadr city, a Shia suburb of Baghdad, on February 28, that killed 70 people, a suicide bomber attack during a funeral in Muqdadiya on Feb 29, an attack by four suicide bombers against an Iraqi military headquarters in Haditha on March 1, and a suicide bomber who detonated a bomb during a soccer game on March 25, in a stadium in Iskanderiyah, 30 miles south of Baghdad, that killed 29 people and injured 60 more. Finally, although it will not deter the support provided by the U.S. and its allies for the Iraqi army, it is likely that IS militants in Europe, and even possibly the United States, will look to attack soft targets where the opportunity presents itself as a way of punishing U.S. and NATO support for the Iraqi Army. Over the last 18 months, the ability of Islamic State to stage sophisticated, well planned attacks against Western targets has improved significantly. On March 22, less than four months after similar attacks in Paris, IS militants launched a series of attacks in Brussels, at the airport and a subway station, which resulted in the deaths of at least 31 people and injured 250 others. The campaign to retake Mosul is just beginning. Coupled with the losses that it is experiencing in Syria, we may well see the Islamic State lose all or most of the territory it controls in Syria and Iraq over the next 18 to 24 months. Such an outcome is far from certain, however, and it can be expected that IS will strike back wherever it can, especially at soft targets in Europe and the United States. Even if the campaigns in Syria and Iraq to roll back the Islamic State are successful, IS will remain a powerful international insurgency capable of continuing to strike at Europe and the United States, and is still actively engaged in Libya and some three dozen other countries around the world. Regardless of the additional defeats that the Islamic State may experience over the next 12 to 24 months, this is not the beginning of the end for the Islamic State, it is at the very best only the end of the beginning."

This prophecy is at the core of the Islamic State's apocalyptic vision of how Islam will triumph and come to rule in a worldwide caliphate.The Islamic State has named its glossy propaganda magazine Dabiq, and each issue prominently features the quote from Abu Musab Zarqawi, ""The spark has been lit here in Iraq and its heat will continue to intensify -- by Allah's permission -- until it burns the crusader armies in Dabiq.""The fall of Mosul would be a critical loss for the Islamic State. The outcome of the Iraqi campaign to take it will be long and difficult, however, and success is in no way assured. There are three crucial elements that will dictate the likelihood of success of the operation to take Mosul: the military campaign itself, the political issues surrounding the campaign and how IS will respond both within Iraq and abroad.The military aspect of the campaign is relatively straightforward. Kurdish Peshmerga forces have surrounded Mosul from the north, east and west. With the capture of Tal Afar, all of the major highways leading to the north, east and west, highways 47, 1, 2 and 3 have all been cut off. Highway 1 to the south, from Mosul as far as Baiji, is still more or less in the hands of IS, as are portions of Highway 80 immediately around Mosul as far as the juncture with Highway 3. Current Iraqi military operations in Makhmur, and eventually al Qayyarah to the west, combined with an Iraqi drive up Highway 1 from Baiji, would finish the encirclement of Mosul. Although some secondary roads would remain open, they would not allow much access to additional IS supplies or military forces in Syria.Based on the prior experience with the recapture of Tikrit and Ramadi, the liberation of Mosul is likely to see a prolonged urban campaign characterized by protracted street-to-street fighting with liberal use of IEDs and booby traps as well as the use of tunnels to strike unexpectedly at the rear of advancing Iraqi troops. While close air support and the use of precision munitions to target IS strongpoints will give the advancing Iraqi army a significant advantage, the campaign will likely be long and difficult and will take, at the very least, the better part of 2016 and will likely extend into 2017. Moreover, there is a significant civilian population still in Mosul. As of February 4, 2016, it was estimated that there were still 700,000 civilians in the city. By comparison there were hardly any civilians left in Tikrit and only about 4,000 in Ramadi when those campaigns began.According to Iraqi government sources it's estimated that there are approximately 10,000 IS militants still in Mosul. At this point it is still unclear whether Islamic State will withdraw any of those fighters in anticipation of the attack on Mosul. Originally Baghdad estimated that it would need approximately 24,000 soldiers to recapture the city. Pentagon sources placed the number at close to 40,000. Both numbers may turn out to be to low, however. By comparison, Tikrit was held by around 1,000 IS militants and Ramadi by approximately 2,000 militants. The Tikrit campaign took two months and the Ramadi campaign close to four months before each city was effectively secured. In the Tikrit campaign, Iraqi forces had a better that ten to one advantage over IS militants, although the Iraqi forces were made up primarily of poorly trained Shia militias. In the case of Ramadi, the Iraqi force was made up primarily of regular Iraqi Army units and Iraqi Special Forces, but here again they enjoyed a better than five to one numerical advantage. The political issues surrounding the Mosul campaign will weigh heavily on the likelihood of success there. Historically the city of Mosul was predominantly Kurdish. The city and the surrounding region had traditionally been considered part of Anatolia rather than Mesopotamia. It was a separate province (vilayet) under the Ottomans from the two provinces (Baghdad Vilayet and Basra Vilayet) that made up the historic region of Mesopotamia. Under the Armistice of Mudros, between Great Britain and the Ottoman Empire, Mosul was to have remained part of Turkish Anatolia as the region was still controlled by the Ottomans when the armistice went into effect on October 31, 1918. British forces, however, spurred by the discovery of oil in the region, continued to advance for two more weeks after the ceasefire until they had secured Mosul and the surrounding region.Mosul was part of the northern no fly zone enforced by the U.S. and Britain from 1991 to 2003. During this period, however, the Saddam Hussein government implemented an aggressive policy of ""Arabization"" that saw the government relocate large numbers of Sunni Arabs to the city and in some cases expel some of the non-Arab inhabitants. A significant portion of the senior leadership in the Iraqi Army came from Mosul, a fact that may explain how a significant number of former Baathist military and government officials have come to play a significant role in the administration of the city while it has been under IS control. The Kurdistan regional government in Ebril has previously indicated that it would like to see Mosul included in the Autonomous Kurdistan Region. Such an outcome is highly unlikely, however. The Baghdad government would not want to see its second largest city incorporated into Iraqi Kurdistan. Its historical roots notwithstanding, the city is predominantly Sunni Muslim now. Moreover, it is likely that the city will suffer extensive damage during the military campaign and the tab for rebuilding it will amount to tens of billions of dollars - a sum beyond the means of the currently cash strapped Kurdistan regional government. Disposition of forces in Iraq and Syria as of March, 2016  What role the Kurdish Peshmerga forces will play in the battle for Mosul is unclear. Previously the Kurdistan regional government had announced that Iraqi military forces would not be allowed to enter in or operate from Kurdish territory. Moreover, the Kurdish regional government's financial constraints, and an unwillingness to spill Kurdish blood for what will ultimately be an Iraqi city, also means that the role of the Peshmerga will likely be to hold the current defensive positions to the east, north and west of Mosul, but not otherwise actively participate in the actual advance on the city.The role that the Shia militias will play is also unclear. Previously, those militias and their Iranian sponsors had lobbied for an active role in the Mosul campaign. The Baghdad government has resisted a prominent role for the Shia militias fearing a repeat of the sectarian violence that erupted following the liberation of Tikrit. The situation with those militias is very fluid, however. The current Shia dominated government in Baghdad is badly fractured. A more prominent role for the Shia militias may be the price that the Sadr and other Shia political groups demand for their support of the government. At the moment, Shia militias are actively engaged against Islamic State forces in the desert areas surrounding Samarra, roughly halfway between Baghdad and Tikrit but do not appear to have a significant presence further north. Moreover, if past experience with Islamic State is a guide, an offensive up the Tigris valley against Mosul will likely precipitate attacks by IS militants in the Euphrates Valley, especially in Sunni dominated Anbar province. Indeed the IS seizure of Ramadi in May 2015, was in part prompted by visible signs that Baghdad was readying a campaign up the Tigris Valley toward Mosul. It's unclear, and probably unlikely, that the Iraqi Army has sufficient strength to engage IS militants on both the Euphrates and Tigris fronts. Baghdad will likely have to rely on the Shia militias to deal with any new IS attacks on the cities in the Euphrates Valley. Depending on how extensive those attacks are, and the extent to which Baghdad is dependent on the Shia militias to contain them, may well determine whether those militias can successfully demand a larger role in the Mosul Campaign.Baghdad is relying primarily on the U.S. trained Iraqi Army to lead the advance on Mosul. How effective those forces are going to be, however, remains unanswered. U.S. trained Iraqi Special Forces performed well during the Ramadi Campaign. The ""Golden Battalion,"" the Iraqi 36th Commando Battalion, in particular, has received high praise from U.S. advisors. It is not clear yet whether Iraqi Special Forces are active in the Mosul campaign or are still deployed in mopping up operations around Ramadi.Regular Iraqi forces, however, are still a question mark. There were numerous reports of Iraqi troops fleeing the battlefield during military operations against IS militants in the village of Nasr, south of Mosul, on March 25, when they came under prolonged sniper fire from IS fighters in the village. Adjacent Peshmerga units, most armed only with old Kalashnikovs and lacking the modern equipment of the Iraqi units, held their positions, on the other hand. The same thing had happened a week earlier when Iraqi troops fled their positions defending a newly established U.S. Marines base near Makhmor. The facility, technically a firebase, was manned by 200 Marines from the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit. The firebase is supposed to provide artillery support for the Iraqi troops clearing IS militants in the area and for the eventual advance on Mosul as well as to stiffen the resolve of the Iraqi military units, the 15th Division, in the area. One marine was subsequently killed when IS militants were able to approach close enough to the firebase to attack it with mortars. What role Sunni militias will play in the Mosul campaign is also unclear. The U.S. has been urging the Baghdad government to organize and arm a Sunni National Guard, but the Iraqi government continues to be reluctant to do so fearing that such units would become the core of an armed Sunni resistance to Baghdad. Military equipment that the Pentagon has supplied to Iraq to arm a Sunni National Guard has instead gone to Shia National Guard units. The Turkish government has signaled that it sees a role for itself in training and arming Sunni militia units but is does not appear that it has moved to actively do so yet. The likely response of Islamic State to the Mosul campaign will be fourfold. On the Tigris front they will adopt a scorched earth strategy relying heavily of IEDs and other types of booby traps to slow the Iraqi advance while engaging in a protracted street-by-street urban campaign within Mosul itself. In addition, they are likely to deploy insurgency tactics in the rear of the Iraqi forces advancing on Mosul. They are also likely to opportunistically bring pressure on the Euphrates front, especially in Anbar province, to tie up Iraqi troops and Shia militias and divert them from being deployed against Mosul. It is also likely that IS militants will single out captured Iraqi Army Shia soldiers for particularly gruesome executions as a way of reducing the military's morale.  Islamic State's propaganda magazine Dabiq  IS will also likely launch attacks against civilian targets in Baghdad and in the Shia dominated south. Already there are signs that this may be happening. Since February there has been a string of IS launched terrorist attacks in Iraq. These attacks have included two bombs that exploded at a market in Sadr city, a Shia suburb of Baghdad, on February 28, that killed 70 people, a suicide bomber attack during a funeral in Muqdadiya on Feb 29, an attack by four suicide bombers against an Iraqi military headquarters in Haditha on March 1, and a suicide bomber who detonated a bomb during a soccer game on March 25, in a stadium in Iskanderiyah, 30 miles south of Baghdad, that killed 29 people and injured 60 more. Finally, although it will not deter the support provided by the U.S. and its allies for the Iraqi army, it is likely that IS militants in Europe, and even possibly the United States, will look to attack soft targets where the opportunity presents itself as a way of punishing U.S. and NATO support for the Iraqi Army. Over the last 18 months, the ability of Islamic State to stage sophisticated, well planned attacks against Western targets has improved significantly. On March 22, less than four months after similar attacks in Paris, IS militants launched a series of attacks in Brussels, at the airport and a subway station, which resulted in the deaths of at least 31 people and injured 250 others. The campaign to retake Mosul is just beginning. Coupled with the losses that it is experiencing in Syria, we may well see the Islamic State lose all or most of the territory it controls in Syria and Iraq over the next 18 to 24 months. Such an outcome is far from certain, however, and it can be expected that IS will strike back wherever it can, especially at soft targets in Europe and the United States. Even if the campaigns in Syria and Iraq to roll back the Islamic State are successful, IS will remain a powerful international insurgency capable of continuing to strike at Europe and the United States, and is still actively engaged in Libya and some three dozen other countries around the world. Regardless of the additional defeats that the Islamic State may experience over the next 12 to 24 months, this is not the beginning of the end for the Islamic State, it is at the very best only the end of the beginning."

More than halfway through a nomination race that she entered as the clear favorite, Clinton finds herself deadlocked with Bernie Sanders among Democrats. Photographer: Patrick T. Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb9381d2400005000578e9a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In order to (try to) avoid a torrent of angry responses regarding Bernie still having a shot to win the nomination, let me state that I am not assuming anything, and that I think Bernie should absolutely continue his race for the nomination and not drop out. And, I write this as someone very sympathetic to Bernie's agenda. Finally, while I believe both Hillary and Bernie could win a general election, I happen to think that Hillary is a safer bet. There has not yet been the torrent of negative campaigning against Bernie that Hillary has endured for a quarter of a century, and yet she is not only still standing but is not so far behind Bernie's margins against Trump. Winning the general is far more important than whether it is Bernie or Hillary.Let me now move to why, if Hillary is the nominee, she should select Bernie as the VP candidate.1. It shows the respect due a large portion of the Democratic electorate who worked hard and voted for Bernie. 2. More importantly, it shows the respect due, and will be insisted upon by Bernie if he accepts, to the agenda he offered.3. It will swell the crowds at campaign rallies beyond anything the Republican base can match, providing both the votes and energy to win a resounding victory.4. It will provide Bernie's millions of online contributors, enabling the Hillary-Bernie ticket to take federal funding and eschew large contributions. 5. It will be another -- along with the first female nominee and president -- precedent-breaking move for an electorate that wants precedents broken. But, in a positive way.Why Bernie should, under certain policy conditions, accept.1. From the VP perch, Bernie will be in the ideal position to continue to mobilize voters to achieve the policy ends he has championed. (Two days after President Obama's first election, I urged him to do just that. He didn't. It hurt.)2. Many of the differences between Bernie and Hillary are resolvable. For example, in health care, adding the public option to Obamacare provides the means for both perspectives to be incorporated. In banking, breaking up the big banks makes passing Glass-Steagall less compelling. Minimum wage level compromises are being forged all around the country. 3. Bernie should insist, and Hillary should agree, that on cabinet positions such as Treasury, Labor, HHS, that Bernie and she need to have a consensus. My choice for Treasury: former Labor Secretary, Robert Reich. For HHS, Howard Dean, M.D. For Labor: Larry Cohen, President of the Communications Workers.4. From the VP perch, Bernie could not only mobilize the pressure in the Congress for an amendment to overturn Citizens United, he could barnstorm states as their legislatures were considering the amendment to ratify it. He could also insist that IRS re-write the rules on ""dark money"" to be consistent with Congressional language when it was passed. 5. Bernie should be permitted to avoid many of the ceremonial chores of the Vice-Presidency, so he has time to focus on policy and mobilization. That is where Bill Clinton becomes even more valuable. Having a former president who is the husband of the sitting president attend to many of these symbolic duties, rather than the sitting Vice-President, is no reduction in honor or prestige of those events. 6. Due to age, this is Bernie's last hurrah as a potential presidential candidate. By bringing the party together, by helping the ticket win a resounding victory in November, by employing his new-found fame and passionate support to mobilize pressure not just to talk about, but actually to pass important legislation, he will have made contribution to our country as large as he might have as president. Presidents from FDR to Obama have urged people to ""make me do this"" when they support a policy that faces entrenched opposition.   Let us not kid ourselves: Medicare and the Civil Rights Laws including the Voting Rights Act, recently eviscerated by the right-wing Supreme Court, passed only because the reaction to President Kennedy's assassination provided LBJ with huge majorities, and his opponent was Barry Goldwater. Much of the economic and social progress under the New Deal occurred only because FDR enjoyed large majorities. If Hillary is the nominee, a Hillary-Bernie ticket will be a big winner, and a Clinton-Sanders administration will be a big winner for the American people."

The events described in his play, Djihad, which is French for jihad, came crashing into real life on Tuesday.That morning, the 39-year-old playwright and actor saw the news of a bombing at Brussels’ Maelbeek subway station and panicked. Saidi repeatedly tried to call his son, who was commuting to school. He finally picked up 20 minutes later. His son said he got off the train one stop before Maelbeek.Twenty people were killed at the subway station that morning, and 11 others lost their lives in two suicide bombings at Brussels airport, the worst terrorist attacks in Belgian history. The Islamic State militant group has claimed responsibility for the bombings.Saidi was still on edge three days after the attacks, as the full horror of Tuesday’s events unfolded. One of his friends has already been confirmed dead in the metro bombing. “It’s awful -- every day we are given a new name,” Saidi told The WorldPost on Friday. “You are just waiting: Do I know someone else?”At night, Saidi goes to the Place de la Bourse, a central Brussels square where people have gathered since the attacks to hold vigils and leave messages and flowers in tribute to the victims. Somehow, it feels safer watching people come together in the square than sitting at home and watching the news, Saidi said.“I found all of Brussels in the square, of all origins, of all colors,” he told The WorldPost. “If we are able to be together, then the terrorists have failed.”This is the very same point that Saidi has made for months, through his play about a group of young Belgian Muslims who decide to join Islamist militants in Syria. Inspired by the 2010 British movie Four Lions, about British suicide bombers, he uses black comedy to humanize extremists and make a serious point about alienation and radicalization. Comedy is a powerful weapon against extremism, in the connections it makes and the taboos it breaks Saidi said. “We can laugh about anything, however dark the subject, as long as we respect each other,” he told The WorldPost in an earlier interview this month. “And when we can laugh together, you can win the war against darkness.”The play is an effort to understand why Belgian youth are heading to the battlefields of Syria and Iraq in such high numbers -- Belgium has the highest proportion of foreign fighters in Europe.The problem is especially close to home for Saidi. He grew up in a Moroccan immigrant family in Brussels’ Schaerbeek neighborhood, the home of at least one of Tuesday’s suicide bombers, and where authorities believe the attackers cooked the explosives for the attacks.Schaerbeek is not at all the terror hotspot described in the media, Saidi said. Some of the neighborhood is impoverished and has high crime rates; other parts are fairly wealthy. It is home to a large North African immigrant population, which could help fugitive terror suspects better to meld in with the community, experts say.Yet Saidi knows well the challenges of growing up Belgian, Muslim and as the son of immigrant parents.He and his friends struggled to reconcile the conservative form of Islam that some in the community espoused, and their love of music, art or girls. All these experiences became ingredients for the theater production, in which Saidi and two of his friends play and share the names of the principal characters, intentionally blurring the line between fact and fiction.Saidi also directly experienced the lure of Islamist militants. Militant recruiters sending young Muslims to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan approached Saidi when he was a teenager in the 1990s. They used the same tactics as the Islamic State recruiters today, Saidi said, and it worked on some of his friends, who went to Afghanistan and never came back.“As a kid growing up, you are lost. And as the son of an immigrant, you are lost twice,” he told The WorldPost. “When someone who is a grown up and knows the Quran approaches you, and says that you’re wasting your time here, and that you can become a hero over there -- it seems like it will give a goal to your life, or at least your death.”Saidi credits his high school with opening his mind to different ideas. “Education is the solution to everything, including radicalization,” he said.Djihad debuted in December 2014, but Saidi initially faced some challenges getting theaters to show the play or get advertising on the metro, because people were nervous about its name.Saidi refused to change the name, saying his whole point is that no group has monopoly over words or ideas, including jihad. The practicing Muslim notes that ""jihad"" in Arabic means struggle, and its first meaning in Islamic tradition is a personal battle against evil within yourself.“That is what we are doing on stage -- trying to tell a story without hiding anything,” Saidi said. “So this is our jihad, too.”But the play spread by word of mouth, and with some support from Belgian authorities. Weeks after Djihad opened, French brothers Chérif and Saïd Kouachi gunned down 12 people at the Paris offices of the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. The Belgian education ministry picked up on Saidi’s play, and helped the team stage it for school children in Belgium. The cast has now performed more than 130 shows to over 46,000 people -- around half of them students. The play has been translated into Dutch, and also performed in Holland and France.The day before Tuesday's attacks, Saidi performed the play in Namur, a city about 30 miles south of Brussels. As usual, the cast and invited experts answered the audience’s myriad questions after the show.“They are afraid, and they are trying to find answers to their fears,” he said of Monday’s post-show debate. “The Muslims are afraid that people don’t like them, while the non-Muslims ask: ‘Why are you so violent?’”Saidi said these debates are exactly the kind of frank conversations that need to take place all over Europe right now, getting all people’s fears and misconceptions out into the open. The play will continue tours in Belgium and France in a few weeks.In the aftermath of the attacks, Saidi again turned his pen on such misconceptions. While he grieved for his friend and his city, Saidi faced hostile comments on social media, questioning why Belgian Muslims weren’t out on the streets condemning the attacks. His powerful response was shared thousands of times on Facebook and reprinted in a Belgian newspaper.“They don’t see Muslims, because we are just like everyone else,” he said. “I wrote this to say: I am like you. Today, I am crying, so leave me alone. Let’s mourn together, and then come back to me in a week and we’ll talk.”Saidi’s Facebook post, translated into English:"

30,MEDIA,The 'Massive Game Of Telephone' That Preceded The Ted Cruz Tabloid Rumors,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-cruz-national-enquirer_us_56f6a613e4b0a372181a17fa,Reporters and operatives spent months caught up in unsubstantiated claims of a sex scandal before they ran in the National Enquirer.,2016-03-26,"Ted Cruz called Trump a ""sniveling coward"" in front of reporters Thursday following the candidate's attack on his wife. On Friday, Cruz accused him of spreading rumors to the National Enquirer. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f6a83b1e0000b300705672.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Rick Wilson got a call earlier this month from a reporter asking about a potentially explosive, campaign-ending piece of opposition research: a Ted Cruz sex tape. Wilson is the type of plugged-in Republican consultant who reporters would expect to know if such a bombshell exists -- and perhaps even when a campaign was ready to drop it. This time, he had no idea. But at the reporter’s request, Wilson contacted a journalist friend at a TV network to see if they’d had it. The TV journalist didn’t have the goods, but had heard another network did. “This became a massive game of telephone,” said Wilson, who recalled fielding calls from upwards of 20 journalists in one day, hailing from major newspapers and networks. They all essentially wanted to know if the Texas senator, who frequently touts his Christian faith on the campaign trail, wasn’t so faithful to his wife. In the days leading up to the March 15 Florida primary, Wilson -- a supporter of former candidate Marco Rubio and boisterous critic of front-runner Donald Trump -- cryptically tweeted about a would-be blockbuster nicknamed “The Thing.” Though Wilson never named names, his tweets were taken, by some, as bolstering an unsubstantiated rumor circulating on social media, and promoted by a little-known political website, that Cruz had an affair with Katrina Pierson, a former adviser to the senator and current Trump national spokeswoman. Pierson even blamed Wilson and another Republican operative for spreading the rumor in a tweet on the morning of Florida’s primary -- long before any mainstream outlets covered it. But Wilson insists he wasn’t the source of the Cruz infidelity rumors.“I never pushed the rumors because I’m an old hand at this business,” the veteran Florida-based operative told The Huffington Post. “When the opposition research is pitched to you as, ‘This is a silver bullet, this will end the campaign,’ it’s always bullshit.”There’s no evidence to support the National Enquirer's report Friday that Cruz had an affair with not just one but five women. Major news outlets that looked into the rumor before or after its publication in the Enquirer haven’t substantiated the claims. Two of the women identified in the story, Pierson and CNN contributor Amanda Carpenter, denied the allegations Friday morning. The candidate himself called an impromptu news conference that afternoon to dismiss them. ""It is complete and utter lies” said Cruz, who also accused Trump and his ""henchmen"" of planting the story, a charge the candidate denied. The tabloid frenzy on Friday capped off a particularly ignoble week in the 2016 Republican primary, in which the leading candidates’ Twitter-fueled spat over their wives diverted the campaign media’s attention from Tuesday’s terrorist attacks in Brussels and the looming question about how the next commander in chief will tackle the self-described Islamic State.The Cruz rumors also put the national media in a familiar bind. It’s one thing to call sources to find out if a potentially campaign-ending scandal is on the way. But it’s another to put those unsupported claims in print or on air. And even as Twitter and Facebook have helped flatten the media landscape, major news organizations still cling to their traditional gatekeeper role when it comes to alleged sex scandals. Even skeptically covering such rumors, it’s believed, can give them too much credence. Complicating matters is that the Cruz story was published Friday in the National Enquirer, which -- though not considered reliably credible by most journalists -- was famously right about John Edwards’ infidelity and other sex scandals. The national media couldn’t confirm the Edwards rumors during the 2008 race and given his denial, tried to ignore them even as the scandal was percolating in the blogosphere. Similarly, while people were buzzing on Twitter about the Cruz rumors Friday morning, national media outlets and the typically chatty journalists they employ were noticeably silent. CNN hadn’t yet covered the Enquirer’s claims around 11:15 a.m. when they were thrust into the mainstream by a scheduled guest, Boston Herald columnist and Trump supporter Adriana Cohen. She was booked to spar with Carpenter, a former Cruz spokeswoman and Trump critic, about the kerfuffle involving the Republican candidates and their wives. But Cohen shifted the conversation to Carpenter and asked the CNN contributor on air whether the allegations involving her and Cruz were true. (Though the Enquirer somewhat blurred the five women’s faces, both Pierson and Carpenter were quickly identified).CNN anchor Kate Bolduan interjected to clarify that the network, which was now inadvertently amplifying the rumors, had no follow-up reporting on them. Carpenter took the opportunity to dismiss the report as “tabloid trash” and told Cohen she “should be ashamed for spreading this smut.”Bolduan said she would be more comfortable shifting the conversation back to the presidential race. Cruz let the national media off the hook a couple hours later by shooting down the claims before reporters in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. This gave them permission to report on the developing scandal, since a candidate’s on-camera denial of an infidelity rumor clearly meets the bar that news executives and editors require for publication even if the unsubstantiated rumor, on its own, wouldn’t.The rumors about Cruz would presumably be in Trump’s interest to circulate. And they came just days after Trump threatened to “spill the beans” on Cruz’s wife, Heidi, as part of an escalating feud between the two that began after an anti-Trump super PAC, unaffiliated with Cruz’s campaign, ran an ugly, negative ad involving Trump’s wife, Melania.During Friday’s news conference, Cruz reminded reporters that the National Enquirer had recently endorsed Trump and that the candidate is longtime friends with David Pecker, CEO of Enquirer parent company American Media Inc. The pair do have a history. Trump invited Pecker to his 2005 wedding and the media executive attended an Elton John concert the following year at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate, according to reports at the time. In early 2013, Pecker appointed David Hughes, a top executive at Trump Entertainment Resorts, to American Media’s board of directors. Later that year, Trump pitched Pecker to lead Time magazine. The National Enquirer’s laudatory coverage of Trump this cycle also stands in sharp contrast to that of his rivals, who’ve faced blaring headlines tying them to drugs and scandal. The Daily News reported in August that the tabloid was going easy on Trump, and New York Magazine traced an October Enquirer story about Dr. Ben Carson having once left a sponge in a patient’s brain back to Trump’s campaign.The National Enquirer denied suggestions it's doing Trump’s bidding. ""No one influences the reporting that The National Enquirer does other than our own reporters and editors,” an American Media spokesman told HuffPost Friday. “We stand by the integrity of our coverage and remain committed to our aggressive reporting on such an important topic. The National Enquirer, more than any other publication, has been unflinching in its reporting on the 2016 presidential candidates.""Cruz also pointed out Friday that Roger Stone, a notorious political “dirty trickster” since the Nixon years, was the only on-the-record source in the Enquirer’s breathless report. Stone, who had previously advised Trump and remains a booster of his candidacy, told The Enquirer that “these stories have been swirling around Cruz for some time” and he believed “where there is smoke there is fire.”“Donald Trump may be a rat, but I have no desire to copulate with him,” Cruz told reporters, a muddled reference to the expletive ""ratfucking"" -- political slang for dirty tricks made famous in the Watergate chronicle All the President’s Men.When The Washington Post’s Dave Weigel asked Stone about Cruz’s suggestion he was the source, the famed operative responded, “Most of what I know about this matter I learned from reporters at your newspaper.""Stone later tweeted that The Post was far from the only outlet looking into the rumors.  The threads have become only more tangled. The Daily Beast reported Friday that the Post -- along with outlets such as The New York Times, Politico and ABC News -- had been pitched the affair rumors for months by anti-Cruz operatives, apparently to help Rubio.One journalist, Texas Monthly senior editor Erica Grieder, said she'd heard the rumors for months. She tweeted Friday that a reporter from a different tabloid outlet asked her in January about the rumor involving Cruz and the Texas-based Pierson. She found the rumor -- that the pair had sex in a closet at a Republican event -- to be dubious. “If the controversial Cruz had snuck off with the controversial [Pierson] at a public event in 2012, I'd have heard about it, years ago,” she tweeted.Grieder heard the rumor again from a journalist while reporting in Iowa and put the claim before Cruz sources, none of whom found it credible. She added that given several outlets were chasing the rumor, one would presumably “have the evidence by now.”“So, overall: those of you hyping #CruzSexScandal are pushing a smear against 5 innocent woman,” Grieder tweeted. “That's pathetic & you should be ashamed.”"

33,POLITICS,These Charts Show Just How Much Puerto Rico Is Shrinking,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/charts-puerto-rico-shrinking_us_56f6db62e4b0a372181a21b0,The largest exodus in 50 years is emptying the island.,2016-03-26,"San Juan, Puerto Rico's capital city, remains beautiful, but it has far fewer people than it did just 15 years ago.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56f6e1191e00008e01711696.jpeg?cache=GxQjfT2wlS&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Obama administration has made the mass departure of people from Puerto Rico a central part of its pleas for congressional action to help the commonwealth, warning that the out-migration is worsening the island’s crippling debt crisis by depleting its tax base. Since most departing Puerto Ricans, who are U.S. citizens, move to the United States mainland and lean Democratic, the warnings carry a subtext for immigration-wary Republicans: Act now to help the island, or face the political fallout later.A new report released on Thursday provides new insight into the acuteness of the crisis. The Pew Research Center analysis of the latest county-level census data shows just how much the faltering economy and accompanying exodus have drained the island of its people, painting a bleak picture that can only add urgency to efforts underway in Congress.Puerto Rico’s population was 3.47 million in 2015 -- 9 percent, or 334,000 people, smaller than it was in 2000, according to Pew.Not surprisingly, the lion’s share of the drop -- some three-quarters -- occurred from 2010 to 2015, as the island’s troubles mounted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.Pew created an animated graphic comparing Puerto Rico's growth in previous decades with the recent decline and illustrating where declines have been largest. San Juan, the island's capital city, has been hit hardest, losing 10 percent of its population, or 40,000 people, since 2000.Pew points to Puerto Rico’s prolonged economic malaise as the primary culprit for its shrinking population. Economic opportunity, according to census data cited by the study, is the main reason Puerto Ricans give for moving to the mainland U.S.But the report also notes another byproduct of the poor economy: It has depressed the fertility rate, making it less likely that people who stay on the island will replace the people who leave.Puerto Rico has dramatically raised taxes and cut spending in recent years to pay down a debt burden of over $70 billion, which the island’s government says it will never be able to pay in full. The effect of the austerity has been to both severely limit the ability of the island's economy to recover -- it has an 11.7 percent unemployment rate, more than twice that of the mainland U.S. -- and hollow out key social services, like health care and education.That is one reason the White House has said that “without congressional action the situation [in Puerto Rico] could soon become a humanitarian crisis” -- even as other observers, like Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), say that crisis has already arrived.And the island could soon face new legal troubles, if, as many expect, it is unable to make bond payments to creditors due in a few weeks.Puerto Rico needs help from Congress because as a U.S. commonwealth it occupies a gray zone that has deprived it of many of the economic liberties available to states. Chief among those is the ability to extend federal Chapter 9 bankruptcy protections to municipalities. Puerto Rico’s government says that without the ability to restructure its debts in a judicially supervised process, it will never be able to recover economically. The commonwealth argued before the Supreme Court on Tuesday that it has the right to pass local bankruptcy laws in the absence of federal protections. If the court rules in the island’s favor, it would allow Puerto Rico to reduce the amount its municipal utilities owe, which, at $20 billion, is only a fraction of its overall debts. A decision in the case is expected by the end of June.Regardless of how the high court rules, however, aid for the island may soon be on its way. House Republicans are hard at work on legislation that would open the door for the island to restructure debts in exchange for financial reforms overseen by a Washington-based fiscal oversight board. House Democrats have said they believe their colleagues are negotiating in good faith."

As the actress told it, Ilaria asked if they could leave twenty minutes in, and so the pair got up.""I just thought she wanted to have a play date with a friend, or something. I wasn't sure what it was,"" Vardalos explained. ""As we were walking to the lobby the manager says, 'Is something wrong?' And she says, 'I don't like the movie. There aren't enough girls in it.'"" ""It was unprompted. I was so surprised,"" the actress said, adding that ""the best part"" was that her daughter got a reward for speaking her opinion. Responding to the girl's complaint, the theater manager asked if she wanted her money back. Ilaria, of course, said yes.""And then we spent it on candy. Which is the life lesson: When you speak up, you get candy,"" the actress laughed.Although Vardalos admitted she was ""tired"" of needing to talk about the topic of women in film, she had glowing words of praise for actress Geena Davis' nonprofit SeeJane, which makes suggestions in movies' pre-production stages to add more women characters. Silverstein, too, shared her frustration seeing a lack of women in movie screeners she watches as part of her job.But even a young girl can pick up on the trouble with representation in film.
