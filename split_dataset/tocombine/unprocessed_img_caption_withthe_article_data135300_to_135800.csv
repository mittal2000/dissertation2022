It is worth reflecting on his ability to transcend politics when speaking about contentious scientific issues. Nowhere was this more apparent than in the difficult politics surrounding HIV/AIDS at the turn of the millennium.It was the year 2000. The 13th International AIDS Conference was taking place in Durban, South Africa, the first time the conference was held on the continent. AIDS was devastating populations in Africa. Yet as hard as it may be to believe now, some African leaders -- and some non-mainstream scientists -- were denying the link between the HIV virus and AIDS.One of the most prominent deniers was South African president Thabo Mbeki, who angered many in his opening remarks to the conference when he declined to affirm that HIV causes AIDS, instead accusing his critics of intolerance to his point of view on the science. ""What I hear being said repeatedly, stridently, angrily,"" he said, ""is, 'Do not ask any questions!'""Just days previously, more than 5,000 scientists had released a statement affirming that the evidence that HIV causes AIDS was ""clear-cut, exhaustive and unambiguous"" and met the highest standards of science. Meeting attendees were frustrated, and scientists with the facts on their side were pitted against those who chose not to accept them. They believed political leaders' refusal to accept the science was killing people. Hundreds walked out.Amid this controversy, Mandela was tasked with giving the closing address. In doing so, he breathed new life into the discussion, calling on politicians and scientists to work beyond their differences to care for those affected by the disease. In his own words:So much unnecessary attention around this conference had been directed towards a dispute that is unintentionally distracting from the real life and death issues we are confronted with as a country, a region, a continent and a world.Our world faces profound science-based challenges that could benefit from this kind of unity. When we focus on the people affected by these challenges, unity is more possible. May we all learn from Nelson Mandela's words and go beyond disagreements about science and politics to confront together the most pressing public health and environmental issues of our time."

I met a beautiful man named Paul who shared my values, my heart and my soul. We quickly knew that we intended to spend the rest of our lives together. We were not looking for legal protection or rights, and the public conversation about same-sex marriage and marriage equality really had not even begun. We just sought to solemnize our relationship into a spiritual marriage.My parents had been on their own journey toward accepting my sexual orientation, and they had evolved to the point that they felt comfortable approaching the minister of their church, whom they had supported significantly for years. They asked him if he would perform a ceremony for us. He answered that even though he wanted to, that he supported what we were doing, he could not. More specifically, he was afraid to perform the ceremony.The truth is that it was unlikely that our private ceremony would have been noticed, but he was worried that his church superiors might somehow catch wind of it, and that he would get in to trouble. He was, in truth, not my first choice to conduct the ceremony anyway, but his cowardice lowered him even further in my perception. I was actually relieved to not be married by a man who was so weak in his own convictions. He dodged the bullet of being judged for doing something right, and I dodged the bullet of not having a blessing said over my life that had no moral courage behind it.One could not say the same thing of another minister, the Rev. Frank Schaefer, a Methodist clergyman who has laid a very public stake in the ground while standing on his own heroic convictions. He too was asked to officiate a same-gender wedding -- his son's -- in 2007. He did not shrink away. His response: ""When he asked me in 2007, 'Dad, would you do my wedding?' I was just honored.""It was a private ceremony, not done defiantly in the faces of Schaefer's Pennsylvania congregation. It was not meant as a protest of the United Methodist Church's policies. It would not have even been an issue had not a lone congregant, Jon Boger, pressed it. Inexplicably, Mr. Boger somehow felt that the baptisms of his children and the funerals of his grandparents had been adversely affected by Schaefer's proceedings over his own son's wedding. Since the events had no relation to each other in any way, I have trouble seeing this as a matter of religious tenet, but rather as pure, unadulterated prejudice, but then, I was not asked my opinion.The decision on whether to go to trial on this issue was under the auspices of Bishop Peggy Johnson. Bishop Johnson received a petition pleading with her not to move forward, but she replied that even though she ""tried really, really hard,"" she had to move forward anyway.Just in case a voice of reason might prevail where a petition of thousands did not, I sent this open letter to Bishop Johnson and any others in the Methodist hierarchy who are judging Rev. Schaefer. Below is my letter to her, and her kind and pretty amazing response back. My letter:Dear Bishop Johnson,Bishop Johnson's reply:Dear Mr WatsonIn conclusion, I want to thank Bishop Johnson for her consideration. My hope is that the progressive voices in the United Methodist Church also rise to the occasion. It is the opportunity for a church not only to stand by a man who deserves it but to stand on the right side of history."
2,QUEER VOICES,Why We Need to Talk About Tom Daley,"John Forde, Contributor

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafbecc250000320037f41d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The media response to British Olympic diver and teen pin-up Tom Daley announcing this week that he is in a relationship with a man only confirms why we need more coming-out narratives.This week, 19-year-old British diver and Olympic bronze medalist Tom Daley joined a small group of professional sportsmen, publicly announcing (via a self-recorded video that he posted on YouTube) that he is happily in a relationship with a man. Despite the impromptu nature of the recording, he chose his words carefully, stating that he is happy and that something had ""clicked"" in the relationship, but avoiding any label about his sexuality and noting that he has dated and still fancies girls.Though a sport's star's sex life is hardly as newsworthy as Syria, the recession, global warming and all the other ""important"" stories that we're meant to be focused on as informed citizens of a developed-world democracy, Daley's news has gripped the public consciousness. Within hours Daley's story became the top story on the Guardian and Times of London websites, and it has literally flooded Facebook and Twitter. (By midday Monday I considered turning off Facebook on my work computer, for fear that IT surveillance would pick up on the multiple photos in my News Feed of near-naked Tom in his sparingly cut diving briefs.)I'm not sure whether Daley is well-known outside the UK, though his orange permatan is surely vivid enough to be seen from space. Here in Britain he's a poster boy for a bewildering cross-section of the British public, for whom he's somewhere between a boy band crush, the object of dark sexual fantasies of men and women alike, and more benign sympathies for his youthful vulnerability and his very publicly reported grief over his coach-father's death from cancer. With millions of followers on Twitter and a bronze medal at last year's Olympics, and now as the star of a popular reality TV show, Splash, Daley is an athlete who, like David Beckham before him, has successfully straddled the austere, highly disciplined world of professional athleticism and the razzle and showbiz of modern celebrity. Given Daley's popularity, this kind of reaction to a major shift in his public persona was in some ways inevitable.Modern Anglo-American culture has moved along in leaps and bounds in recent years in its approach to homosexuality. The campaign for gay marriage, once very much a marginalized ""special rights"" movement, has now become a fashionable badge of modern liberalism, and the widespread horror over Vladimir Putin's homophobic laws in Russia suggests that homophobia, while it hasn't disappeared, has become as unacceptable in the developed world as racism or sexism. With that in mind, I was suspecting, perhaps too optimistically, that Daley would get an easier ride than his predecessors in professional sports who've placed an athletically toned foot outside the closet.Most responses in the UK press have been fairly positive. While the tabloid reportage has been typically sensationalist, panting breathlessly like an elderly flasher at a playground, there's been a bit less prurience and much less of an exposé or witch-hunt feel. And as media-enflamed sex stories go, this one is relatively innocent. Daley chose to make a statement himself rather than being caught pants down in a public toilet like George Michael. He isn't leaving a wife or children devastated in his wake like Welsh rugby player Gareth Thomas did, and he wasn't weighed down with the added anxiety of revealing his HIV status like American diver Greg Louganis. As Daley's video shows, he seems delighted rather than suicidal about his new relationship status, giving the news something of a Richard Curtis-scripted rom-com ambience.Interestingly, most of the commentary has focused less on the fact of Daley's same-sex attraction and more on his decision not to identify himself as gay. In particular, his proviso in the video that he still fancies girls seems to have raised heckles on all sides of the rainbow coalition. As a child of the sexually ambiguous, queer theory-infused 1990s, I have some sympathy for Daley's position. After he tried so carefully in his video not to label himself as ""gay"" or ""bisexual,"" the media and onlookers have ignored this and labeled him themselves, declaring, ""Daley comes out as gay,"" reporting that he's in ""a gay relationship"" or nicknaming him (the rather ghastly) ""Tom Gayley."" There's a cruel irony in all this, as one of Daley's stated intentions for making the video was to dispel a recent ""misquotation"" of him in the press. Though Daley didn't name the story in question, it's likely to have been the article that ran in the Sunday Mirror in September, in which Daley is quoted as saying that he isn't gay. The article has Daley going on to say, ""But even if I was, I wouldn't be ashamed. It wouldn't bother me in the slightest what people thought."" Given that Daley must have been in his current relationship when the interview was published, he's clearly had an interesting three months of soul-searching since, which has hopefully now found resolution in this week's statement.It's a sad truth that even in our post-Bowie, post-Gaga culture, bisexuality is still viewed with suspicion and confusion. Even within lesbian and gay communities, bisexuality is often dismissed as a temporary pose rather than a permanent status, a form of sexual fence sitting before the neophyte subject acquires sufficient courage to settle into their permanent, essentialist sexual identity. For better or for worse, Daley's youth seems to be on his side. At 19 he's still young enough to be seen as ""experimenting"" with his sexuality, so he can be ""forgiven"" for some wavering on the subject -- that is, if you still think there's anything to forgive about liking boys as well as girls.Apart from a smattering of homophobic trolling, the majority of Twitter commentary has followed a live-and-let-live argument, noting that it doesn't really matter how Daley chooses to define himself as long as he's happy. Amid the pre-Christmassy goodwill, there's been a fair amount of sniping from commentators who should know better, all falling over themselves to tell us how Daley's announcement ""isn't important"" or ""shouldn't be news."" Others have echoed something Daley said in his video, that in ""the ideal world"" he wouldn't have to have this conversation, playing up a sense of distaste at even having to consider or discuss the story.Maybe I've been a homo for too long, but something in the back of my fillings aches at this kind of sentiment, which I'm not sure is a self-congratulatory kind of liberalism or just good old-fashioned homophobia hiding behind a polite veneer of old-school politeness. In my experience over the years, I've found it's usually the latter. While my fellow middle-class liberals might consider a conversation about a 19-year-old's sexuality beneath them, very few would question a gay person's right to speak their own truth. The people who'd rather not talk about celebrities coming out are much more likely to be speaking from a deep-seated dislike and disapproval of homosexuality, so when I hear these kinds of protestations toward good taste, I tend to ignore them and plow on regardless.What this kind of ""why do we need to talk about it?"" naysaying misses is that we still do need to talk about Tom. Daley's own reluctance to announce his news until now demonstrates that the decision to go public with his sexuality was a difficult one and came with risks of criticism, rejection and abuse. Such is the lot of most people who identify as LGBTQ (that's ""lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender or queer,"" for the un-acronymed) and don't have Daley's legions or supporters or celebrity status. While gay-friendly folk might imagine that we're living in an enlightened age where sexuality is no longer ""an issue,"" this seems an incredibly naïve and dangerous position to take. Identifying as LGBTQ is still incredibly difficult, especially for young people, and the risks of negative fallout are huge, hence why stories like Daley's become so important for the LGBTQ community, and why his declaration will almost certainly provide a glimmer of encouragement for other young people in a similar situation.For that reason alone, it seems to me that we need more statements like Daley's. People who argue that we don't need to talk about sexuality clearly have very little understanding of the pernicious effects of homophobia, the isolation and trauma of existing in the closet, and the unacceptably high levels of suicide, depression and substance abuse among LGBTQ people -- and, by extension, how important and necessary coming =-out narratives are to encourage others to live openly and honestly. As a young gay man living in a small, conservative town in the pre-Internet era, I scoured the library and newspapers thoroughly for any inkling that other people were or might have been gay. Even today, my ear is still fine-tuned to pick up on same-sex pronouns when someone refers to their partner in conversation or on the news, and I react with surprise as well as delight when someone in the public realm opts to out himself or herself. The world has indeed changed since the un-sepia-tinted days of my youth. Though social media can sometimes seem like an irritating skin condition, persistent, painful and impossible to treat, today they have the magical ability to broadcast Tom's video to LGBTQ people around the world. For some of Tom's audience, his news will be fortifying and inspiring rather than evidence of the decline and fall of civilization or another nail in the coffin of middle-class ennui.The co-opting of Daley's story and the smoothing down of the edges around his narrative, in an attempt to make him ""gay,"" are unfortunate, but it seems inevitable in a society where so few LGBTQ people of any profession are out and proud. The number of professional sportsmen who have identified as gay or admitted to same-sex attraction is still worryingly small, a testament to the cult of compulsory heterosexuality in sports culture. Personally I don't see that there's anything very much the matter with the LGBTQ community wanting to claim Daley for their own. It doesn't seem terribly different from the way straight society ""claims"" every bride and groom or every pregnant woman who waddles by as public property and yet another affirmation of the dominant social order. With that in mind, I'm cautiously happy for the LGBTQ community to celebrate Daley's news as a victory for their team. Daley can, hopefully, choose his own level of involvement with the LGBTQers, if any, at a later date.I've also been disappointed to read so many comments along the lines of ""we knew Tom was gay,"" which once again underscores the tired old clichés existing in our culture about what behavior constitutes ""masculine"" and ""heterosexual"" identity. These gay stereotypes are now so well-worn that it feels as painful as a shin splint to retread them: Daley's boyishly sweet face, his lack of alpha-male aggression, his tendency to soap himself under a shower in his speedos with the cameras rolling, and his hours of time spent sculpting his physique and working on his diving technique are all seen as just a big cultural shorthand for his homosexuality. This week the thousands of gay men, straight women and slightly lascivious grandmas who lusted over Tom in various states of undress had their fantasies come true or get destroyed, depending on their perspective. The clichés were true! Let's disco!This all seems harmless enough, but as Mark Simpson pointed out in his excellent Guardian piece about Daley in the wake of the Mirror interview, this kind of thinking ""reinforces straight-and-narrow and increasingly obsolete ideas about what boys should and shouldn't be -- if they don't conform to that, then they 'must' be gay."" I'm with Mark. A stereotype is still a stereotype and just as limiting and damaging, even if it's ""positive"" or kindly intentioned. No one says ""blacks have great rhythm"" or ""Asians are good at math"" anymore, so why are we allowing ourselves the same kind of lazy stereotyping about sex and sexuality?Any kind of public declaration about the truth of one's sexuality, whether made via YouTube to millions of followers or made quietly in a room to one or two people, is a blow for truth and honesty and a counterattack against the suffocating and damaging effects of homophobia. This week Daley has joined that club of truth tellers, making a statement that's personal and meaningful for him and, because of his celebrity, also has the potential to be meaningful to other people. It's a decision that I (and everyone else who's made a similar decision) can assure him will change his life for the better. Whether he is gay and just fence sitting, bisexual and sure to end up with a woman, or secretly trans and at the start of his journey toward becoming a lady weightlifter named Thomasina is anyone's guess and almost seems beside the point. For today, anyway, he faced his fears, took on the capricious and frequently cruel tide of public opinion, and spoke his truth. And for that I congratulate him."

Welcome to ""Mom and Dads,"" an Israeli series involving a menage-a-trois between two gay men and the mother of their child.""Television is much better than cinema at picking up on changes in society, at responding to them in a fast and varied way,"" said the French film critic Xavier Leherpeur.""That is especially true when it comes to gay marriage and gay rights.""Worldwide some 20 countries now allow gay marriage in all or part of their territory, including 16 out of the 50 US states.""Clearly, Americans are the ones who tackle the subject the most,"" said Leherpeur.The cult sitcom ""Friends"" drew mild controversy back in 1996 for an episode dubbed ""The One with the Lesbian Wedding"", while the sitcom ""Ellen"" broke ground in 1997 with the coming out of its lead character -- and that of series star Ellen DeGeneres.Since then screenwriters have pushed the boundaries right back.Shot as a mockumentary, ""Modern Family"" has notched up the Obama family among its fans since hitting screens in 2009. The comedy revolves around three interrelated family units: one heterosexual, one gay with an adopted Vietnamese daughter, and a third involving a sixty-something man and his younger, voluptuous Colombian wife.""One big (straight, gay, multi-cultural, traditional) happy family,"" runs the strapline for the show.

Blended families of all shapes and sizes were on display through the 1980s, such as in ""Diff'rent Strokes"" in which two African-American children learn to live with a white adoptive father and his daughter.Likewise a divorced working mum, her live-in male housekeeper and their respective children were the stars of ""Who's the Boss"".When shows reverted back to the nuclear family, it was often with a twist, like the all-black cast of the ""The Cosby Show"", or the comically dysfunctional family of 1990s hit show ""Married... with Children"".""Right now we are in a cycle that is all about exploring new types of family,"" said Blot.And same-sex parenting appears to be the issue of choice for 21st-century screenwriters.In a different twist on the plotline of Israel's ""Mom and Dads"", in Britain ""Threesome"" is about a straight couple who have a child together with a gay friend.""Shows like these teach us that these kinds of families exist, and that they have the same problems as everyone else,"" said Leherpeur.In France, the hit sitcom ""Plus belle la vie"" (Life's so Sweet), which is followed daily by some five million viewers, first raised the issue of same-sex parenting two years ago.It showed a gay couple tying the knot in June 2013, just a month after France legalised same-sex marriage.""We tried to cover that storyline as we would any other,"" said the show's lead writer Olivier Szulzynger.France has come a long way in the past decade, he says.""At the beginning of the 2000s, it was hard to tackle gay issues in French fiction.

Expat. Author. Cultural mad scientist. Enemy of the comfort zo...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-20-golden-rules-of-bu_us_5bb303cce4b0480ca6616a70,"Writing great blogs for your business is one of the most valuable marketing techniques you will find, yet it is often forgotten.",2013-12-07,2013-12-05-1176222_10201389672199493_1036535579_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-12-05-1176222_10201389672199493_1036535579_n-thumb.jpg,"Writing great blogs for your business is one of the most valuable marketing techniques you will find, yet it is often forgotten. In fact, small businesses who consistently blog receive 126 percent more leads than those who do not and benefit from 55 percent more visitors to their web pages. However, just writing any old blog isn't enough -- if you're not producing fresh, dynamic and interesting content, you may be sending the wrong message about your brand. Here are 20 golden rules to help you build a great blog for your business:1. Give it a snappy, interesting title.Remember that a potential reader will only see your title, and maybe a thumbnail photo first, and they need to be motivated enough to click -- so make it a good one. A play on words works fantastic -- it evokes familiarity, but deviates enough to draw interest. Question-based titles work great, as do numbered lists. 2. Keep it short.A blog is one thought, one question, or one idea. The more direct and succinct you are, the better. 3. Lead, don't follow.You should write your blog with the genuine intent of reaching your specific target demographic with a message that somehow makes their lives better -- not follow around popular stories and emulate drivel because you think it will go viral or sell a lot of product. 4. Produce original content.Create content that you would want to click on, read and share -- nothing less.5. Consistency is key.Add to your blog at least a few times a week. Too often, companies write one lengthy post and then nothing else for a month. That is the worst thing you can do -- you're basically showing your client base that interacting with them is far down on your to-do list.6. Stay human.Be authentic, funny, self-deprecating, admit your mistakes and be genuinely human. People don't want to read something written by a robot. Of course, you'll want to be personal without being inappropriate or crossing the line into politics, religion or anything offensive or polarizing, got it? 7. Social media and blogging are not the same.A slick, social media campaign, by itself, will do nothing but push around other people's ideas, links and messages -- not your own. A company should produce quality content and disseminate it correctly -- the intersection of social media and content marketing. Content is king and platform is queen.8. Don't focus on the wrong things.Too many companies fall into the trap of being overly concerned with how many ""likes"" or followers you have. Your goal is establish yourself as a credible expert, build trust and bring clients into the sales cycle. All of the impersonal social media metrics in the world won't take the place of a few great client relationships.9. Use photos.Always include photos in your blog. Photos trigger the function of ""mind mapping."" Tweets with a photo are clicked 350 percent more than just links, that means they are 350 percent more likely to draw interest than text alone. 10. Always include a call to action.Your blog should motivate the reader to do one specific thing -- click on a link, answer a question, submit a contact form, take advantage of an offer, sign up for updates, etc. Blogs that offer interesting content but don't have a call to action are like nice roads that lead nowhere.11. If you take your business seriously, don't try to do it yourself.Professional blogging should be left to -- you guessed it -- a professional blogger. Trying to write your blog in your spare time will lead to inconsistency, mushy and unfocused content, short-change your audience and devalue your brand by not being sparkling and professional. You hire marketing, sales, and IT people to excel at specialized functions, and blogging should be no different.12. Engage.A blog should never talk to your audience, it should be a forum to talk with your audience. So use your blog as a conversation starter to engage the reader and begin a great professional relationship.13. Put your blog on your website.It's hard enough to get people motivated to read and share, but you seriously hinder the chance of them taking the next step when your blog is not right on your website. In my humble opinion, it looks amateurish. 14. Don't be ""salesy.""Never overtly push a transaction at them. Instead, solve problems, fill needs and gauge opinions. Explore issues, values and challenges your target demographic has, but never use a blog as a chance to talk about yourself and barrage them with sales messages -- that's what billboards and cheesy infomercials are for. 15. Break up the text.No one wants to read text these days. Opening up an article and seeing line after line of words will ensure your blog never gets read. Instead, make your blog psychologically comfortable for the reader by breaking up text into manageable chunks with photos, subheaders, bullet points, and lists as eye anchors.16. Measure your results.Attach some sort of analytics to your blog so you can measure how many people read it, where they came from, who shared it, how long they stayed on your website, valuable information so you can do more of what works well.17. Link it up.Include links to plenty of other blogs you've written, outside articles, your business and referral partners and community resources. 18. Educate and entertain.The goal of a blog is not to give so much technical information that you make the reader an expert, but to prove that you are the expert, and can be trusted as a credible and honest person to solve their problems. Write technical posts, but also reader questions, testimonials and plenty of blogs that are just interesting or entertaining, as well.19. Write topical and ""evergreen"" information.Writing about current affairs will get you a lot of page views in the short term, but completely irrelevant over time. So mix in plenty of blogs with evergreen information -- content that never dies or becomes outdated. 20. Remember that it's not about you.Your blog is not a forum for you to talk about yourself or your company, complain or blab. It should be a haven for your target demographic to come read content that is interesting, helpful, entertaining, universal and fascinating to them.***  Apply those golden rules to your company blog and the results will astound you.

A probe of JPMorgan hiring practices in China has uncovered red flags across Asia, including an internal spreadsheet that linked appointments to specific deals pursued by the bank, people with knowledge of the matter said. Photographer: Jerome Favre/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb303fb200000e800001909.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dec 7 (Reuters) - Internal JPMorgan Chase & Co emails and computer files being examined by U.S. authorities show that the bank favored hiring people from prominent Chinese families in order to win investment banking business, the New York Times reported on Saturday.The documents show that a JPMorgan program designed to prevent questionable hiring practices was ultimately viewed inside the company as ""a gateway to doing business with state-owned companies in China,"" the Times said, adding that it had reviewed copies of the emails and computer spreadsheets.In one email, an executive said that hiring sons and daughters of powerful people in China ""almost has a linear relationship"" with winning assignments, the Times said.A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment on the report, as did representatives of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the office of the federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, New York, which are investigating the matter.The Times said there ""is no indication that executives at JPMorgan's headquarters in New York were aware of the hiring practices described in the documents.""JPMorgan first disclosed in August that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission was investigating its employment of certain people and its relationships with certain clients.Since then, the SEC and the U.S. Department of Justice and have stepped up an industry-wide probe that has been a cause of alarm for global banks. Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Citigroup Inc are among the banks that have received requests for information from the SEC.It had become a common practice for investment banks to hire people with government connections. This is especially prevalent in China because of the role the ruling Communist Party plays in the country's business.The law enforcers are examining whether hiring practices violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. law that bars bribes or special favors to foreign government officials in exchange for business. At issue is whether the banks hired unqualified applicants as a favor to a government official who was in a position to award them business.One person familiar with the SEC inquiry has likened the probe to a previous investigation U.S. authorities conducted into whether oil and gas companies paid bribes to circumvent import regulations in Africa and elsewhere."
6,BUSINESS,8 States With The Highest Minimum Wages: 24/7 Wall St.,"24/7 Wall St., 24/7 Wall St.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/highest-minimum-wages_us_5bb303f7e4b0480ca6616ff3,(Click here to read the eight states with the highest minimum wages) 24/7 Wall St.: The White House recently announced President,2013-12-07,"Don't know how it could have been more beautiful, but Nancy says in the spring this field is full of wildflowers.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb303f71f0000250123bb85.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"24/7 Wall St.: The White House recently announced President Barack Obama’s support for a Senate bill that would increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10 an hour. While it remains to be seen whether the bill will make it through Congress, many states are not waiting to take action.Five states have passed measures to raise the minimum wage this year, according to data published by the National Conference of State Legislators. Only one of these states, California, has passed a bill that would raise the minimum wage to $10 per hour. Based on data from the U.S. Department of Labor, 24/7 Wall St. identified the states with the highest minimum wages.(Click here to read the eight states with the highest minimum wages)Whether or not a higher minimum wage is good for the economy continues to be the subject of debate. The National Employment Law Project (NELP), which advocates raising the minimum wage, maintains that the decline in the purchasing power of the minimum wage “has contributed to the growth of income inequality over the past three decades.”Other groups maintain that raising the minimum wage is bad for business and jobs. The Heritage Foundation notes that if the United States raises the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour, the combined costs of wages, employer penalties for not paying health insurance and taxes “would raise the minimum cost of hiring a full-time worker to $12.71 per hour.”24/7 Wall St. A state’s cost of living may influence its minimum wage. The cost of living in six of the eight states with a minimum wage over $8 an hour is higher than the nationwide cost of living. In Connecticut, where the minimum wage is currently $8.25, the cost of living is the fourth highest in the nation. The cost of living is similarly high in California, Massachusetts and Vermont.Another factor keeping the minimum wage high in these states likely involves labor representation. Among these eight states, only Nevada is a “right to work state,” meaning workers cannot be required to join a union or pay for a union’s costs as a condition of employment.Many states where current minimum wages are among the nation’s highest also have high union membership. In Washington, which currently has the nation’s highest minimum wage, 18.5% of workers are union members, fourth highest nationally. Among private sector workers, five of the eight states had among the 10 highest union membership.Based on information provided by the U.S. Department of Labor, 24/7 Wall St. identified the eight states with a minimum wage above $8 per hour. Additional figures on the cost of living in various states are from the Missouri Economic Research and Information Center (MERIC). Data on union membership by state are from the Union Membership and Coverage Database for 2012. Figures on poverty, income and income inequality as of 2012 are from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. Unemployment rates are as of October 2013, from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.These are the eight states with the highest minimum wages, according to 24/7 Wall St.: "

(Photo by Rick Kern/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb444ec240000320056083e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sara Bareilles became the surprise victor during Friday's announcement of the 2014 Grammy nominations. The singer's ""The Blessed Unrest"" bested Kanye West's ""Yeezus,"" Lorde's ""Pure Heroine,"" Justin Timberlake's ""20/20 Experience,"" Bruno Mars' ""Unorthodox Jukebox"" and Vampire Weekend's ""Modern Vampires of the City,"" among others, to land a spot amid the finalists for Album of the Year.""The Blessed Unrest"" debuted in July to favorable reviews but has failed to chart on many critics' year-end rankings, including those from Rolling Stone, Entertainment Weekly and SPIN. While the Grammys don't foster the frenzied prognostications that the Oscars and Emmys do, most who chimed in to forecast the potential nominees did not have Bareilles on their radar. A glance at last year's Album of the Year contenders amplifies the confusion surrounding Bareilles' inclusion. The five honorees -- The Black Keys, fun., Frank Ocean, Jack White and winner Mumford & Sons -- all appeared on a slew of best-of lists, and each act garnered a bundle of additional Grammy nominations. Bareilles, on the other hand, only nabbed one other accolade this year: a nod for Best Pop Solo Performance, for ""Brave."" (The song will compete against Katy Perry's ""Roar,"" which was accused of having lifted its melody from ""Brave."")""Brave,"" to a lesser degree, also feels out of place among its counterparts in Best Pop Solo Performance. The song peaked at No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100, instead finding a more comfortable spot on the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart, where it reached No. 2. Three of the category's other nominees -- Bruno Mars' ""When I Was Your Man,"" Lorde's ""Royals"" and Perry's ""Roar"" -- each ascended to No. 1 on the Hot 100, while the fifth entry -- Justin Timberlake's ""Mirrors"" -- touched No. 2.Regardless, fans of Bareilles are surely rejoicing in the chanteuse's windfall. The 34-year-old singer's ""Love Song"" was previously nominated for Song of the Year and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, the latter of which also hosted ""King of Anything"" as a nominee in 2011. This year's honors bring Bareilles' Grammy total to five nominations.The singer took to Twitter on Friday to express her ebullience.Bareilles will compete against Daft Punk's ""Random Access Memories,"" Kendrick Lamar's ""Good Kid m.A.A.d. City,"" Macklemore & Ryan Lewis' ""The Heist"" and Taylor Swift's ""Red"" for Album of the Year.What do you think? Is Bareilles' recognition deserved, or did she stampede over worthier honorees? Chime in below, and read about more of this year's Grammy snubs here.CORRECTION: Bareilles' total Grammy nominations is now five, rather than four."

Ah, so this is September on the Gulf Coast?",2013-12-06,2013-11-08-GalvestinIslandRoadToFreedom560x420.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-11-08-GalvestinIslandRoadToFreedom560x420-thumb.jpg,"It was supposed to be a three-week road trip down the Texas Gulf Coast, but it ended up getting shortened into a long weekend in rainy Galveston.But you won't hear us complaining. We like wet.Wet, within reason. As in, gray skies and a shower here and there. Florida wet is fine with us too; those afternoon thunderstorms so predictable you can set your watch to them.But not the relentless, almost-horizontal sheets of water that hammered us from the ocean, accompanied by gale-force winds. We hadn't seen anything like it since a hurricane almost swept our car off the road in upstate New York a few years ago.Ah, so this is September on the Gulf Coast? There goes our trip to the beach, Galveston Island Historic Pleasure Pier, even the Ocean Star Offshore Drilling Rig Museum and Education Center, we told the kids.We were stranded. And we were unhappy. It was the last day of summer, and the first leg of our trip to see friends in Dallas had been canceled and the latter part of the road trip to Corpus Christi had also been called off. After Galveston Island, we were heading home.So how did we turn this one around? By embracing the moisture, that's how. We stayed indoors at our hotel, taking advantage of the amenities, spending time together, and appreciating the stormy weather for what it brought to Galveston. You'd be surprised.Location mattersWhen horrible weather hits you realize how important your accommodations become. After all, a heavy downpour probably means you'll be spending some quality time in your digs. Is your family of five sandwiched into one room? That's probably gonna hurt. Or, are you staying at a property with kids' entertainment? Maybe all is not lost.We were staying at the Holiday Inn Resort, which is part of the San Luis Resort Spa and Convention Center, so there were some indoor activities that didn't include jumping across the room from bed to bed or watching TV all afternoon. Inside the complex, there's a minigolf course and a Rainforest Cafe. Fortunately for us, we also had adjoining rooms at the Holiday Inn Resort, so we could sit near the window and watch the rain come down without also being on top of each other.Our family has been on the road almost nonstop for the last two years, but we rarely get to take a breather. This was a great opportunity to put down the laptop, the camera, turn off the TV and talk to each other. As a bonus, I learned that I now have three children.Look what the tide brought inInclement weather brings out the adventurous Texans, from the jeeps they take for a joyride in the sand to the surfers who catch the mud-brown waves churned up by the storm. Red flags that warned swimmers to stay out of the water were flapping all day, but that only seemed to attract the surfers. Even though swells were no bigger than a quiet day on Waikiki beach, they seemed grateful for having something to stand on.To tell you the truth, we met a surprising number of families at the beach despite the wind and rain. Many could be seen picking shells from the sands and standing knee deep in the tumble of the waves. A brave few joined the surfers using boogie boards much closer to the shore.We took advantage of the short breaks in the weather to venture out and admire the memorials that adorn Seawall Boulevard. It was nice to be able to stretch our legs and be loud even if just for a little while.We're happy our weekend in Galveston got rained out. Really, we are. It forced us to get creative. Instead of relying on the destination to entertain us, we had to make our own fun. And we did.Still, I hope the next time we're here, the rain will let up for a few minutes. That roller coaster on the pier looks like a scream!"

Especially when you book a flight without doing your research.,2013-12-06,colorful quilts paint the walkways of Jaisalmer's fort,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-12-01-jaisalmer_colorful_quilts-thumb.jpg,"India can be a scary place. Especially when you book a flight without doing your research. We didn't originally have India on our itinerary, but when I spotted a $50 ticket from Kuala Lumpur, I figured the opportunity was too good to pass up. It was only after I pressed ""confirm"" that I realized how big the country was and how impossible it was going to be to see all of it in two measly weeks. We narrowed it down to the typical tourist loop through Rajasthan but I wasn't satisfied. Doing just the highlights felt like cheating. Of course I wanted to see the Taj Mahal and some of the colored cities, but I also wanted to discover India the way I had the other eight countries we'd visited on our trip.That's when an India-born friend suggested Jaisalmer. Jaisalmer is very close to the end of the world for India. About 100km from the Pakistan border, this small city rises out of the desert and disappears back into it just as quickly as it appeared. Its claim to fame is the 11th century fort that functions as the town's tourist drawcard and a living heritage sight. Over 5,000 people still live and work inside its walls.It could truly be called the world's largest inhabitable sand castle, and it's hard not to be charmed by the sandstone mansions (called havelis), Jain temples, and colorful quilts that fill Jaisalmer's twisted streets.The reason most tourists come to Jaisalmer is to wander the old town and take an overnight camel safari out into the desert. But because my mother joined us for this portion of the trip, an overnight safari was off the table and a bit of luxury awaited in its place.That's how we ended up being hosted by Suryagarh, a five star boutique fort hotel outside of Jaisalmer which somehow managed to be even more charming than the city itself.Our experience started with the ride to the hotel after a 12+hour train ride from Jaipur. An air conditioned car would have been enough, but we were escorted in our journey by ""guards"" who stood in the back of the jeep driving in front of us and held the hotel's signature flags.Inside the main courtyard, we were greeted by drums, traditional singing, rose petals that fluttered down from the sky, and the fort's priest, who blessed us before inviting us in. The location, in a desolate strip of desert, made our stay here even more realistic. After all, forts were always built in the middle of nowhere and they, like Suryagarh, were self-sufficient. Everything you could ask for was here--evocative rooms that manage to be modern, a swimming pool in the shade, blazing fast WiFi, nightly snacks on your bedside table, and delicious cuisine that ranges from Indian to Mediterranean.We realized after a few hours that Suryagarh wasn't just a hotel as we originally anticipated. It was a destination in itself, one that helped us discover the best of Jaisalmer and the Thor Desert by getting us off the tourist track and into a whole different frame of mind. Instead of a crowded camel safari, think multi-course dinners on the dunes where you're serenaded by ""house"" musicians and dancers who still practice the music and craft of their ancestors. Imagine rides through desert ghost towns and stops at hidden Jain temples that reminded us of the fairytale landscape of Bagan in Burma. Picture picnics in verdant valleys, camel rides followed by sunset cocktails, and breakfasts with magicians and peacocks.All this, and more, is possible in Jaisalmer, and it all combines to make this tiny town an unmissable stop on your India journey -- no matter where you decide to stay. (Though if you do decide to stay in Suryagarh, we promise you won't regret it, especially considering what great value it is for a five star hotel.)Our biggest tip: don't make the mistake of giving Jaisalmer only one night. If you do, you'll miss the men in multicolored turbans peeping through the yellow sand, women in colorful saris herding sheep, brothers singing traditional songs on top of moving cars, peacocks plucking for seeds while snakes slink into the desert, and the moon setting as you sip a glass of wine in the dunes.

""down there"" privates, and what to call them.In one corner, you have the Avoiders, who would prefer their kids learned about their nether-parts sometime after college; these parents often use words like ""dingle"" and ""nether-parts"" instead of whatever those ding dongs and whippersnappers are really called.In the other corner, you have the Informers, who start discussing sexuality with their children in utero using terms that even I, an adult by most standards, barely understand without a medical dictionary (or without giggling).With my kids, I've pretty much played this issue by ear, which most of you probably know is parenting code for ""I ignore it until I absolutely can't ignore it anymore, then I continue to ignore it for a couple more days while I decide what to do, except I forget until it comes up again and I have to stall some more because I was caught off-guard and quite frankly, just don't want to think about it.""After 11 years of use, this system was still working great -- sort of.Our 2-year-old likes to follow us everywhere, including to the bathroom. For a long time, she didn't really show any interest in what I was doing in there; she just wanted to hang out and discuss Polly Pockets until I was finished.That was fine, until one day when I was on my ""lady time"" (or whatever you want to call it), and the extra few seconds of bathroom-related commotion caught Madeline's attention. She tilted her head to one side, eyes widening, and came to this obvious conclusion, which she then proceeded to announce to everyone who would listen:""MOMMY PUT PAPER TOWELS IN HER FRONT BUNS!""This was our first clue that somebody was going to have to talk to the girl about what was going on in people's, um, pants-ular areas. But... meh. There was plenty of time.Until there wasn't.Not too long after that, Madeline waltzed into the bathroom while my husband was in there. Although she didn't actually see anything, she suddenly noticed a...shape in the front of Daddy's pants. A shape she'd never noticed before, but one she thought she recognized.""Daddy? What dat? Dat right there? DADDY, WHY YOU HAVE POOP IN YOUR PANTS?""*giggles*With this level of confusion, even I couldn't justify putting it off any longer. My husband and I, being super mature grown-ups, decided we would tell her the Real Technical Terms for people's crotch parts. We didn't get too crazy with it -- I vow I'll go to my grave without uttering the word (whispers) genitals in front of my children -- so we simply explained that daddies have a penis and mommies have a vagina, that boys and girls are a little different, but everyone keeps those parts covered up because they're private.However, like every toddler, the girl enjoys repetition. Or maybe it was because my super-mature spouse and I were laughing pretty hard at this point, but whatever the reason, we continued to discuss it.""What you sayed?""We said it again.""Daddy, you have a... What you sayed?""Paying some sort of karmic price for avoiding those words for so long, we said them again.With a look of sudden understanding, my daughter announced, ""Oh, Mommy has a vageenus! Wait... what you sayed?""Whichever one of was was laughing in a less obvious way said it again. She almost grasped it this time.""So, Daddy has a penis, and Mommy has... a Mommy peanuts!""Closer.""MOMMY HAS PEANUT BUNS!""Not even hiding the uncontrollable laughter anymore.So that's why, instead of my daughter learning the actual medical terms for her body parts, I now use the term peanut buns. And frankly, I think that's a much better term than hoo-ha (or whatever it's called) anyway.This piece originally appeared on Hollow Tree Ventures.Also on HuffPost:"

Many parents have been asked to buy a doll with a large bust wearing a mini-skirt or a large plastic contraption. But, this holiday season it's OK to just say no to the toys that are all hype and will wind up at the bottom of the toy heap in record time, the toys that promote unflattering images of girls and the toys that will break after only a few uses. Instead, focus on toys that will teach your children something new, broaden their horizons about who they become and give them the lasting gift of sparking their imagination and teaching them new ways to think about the world. Going to a locally-owned toy store with a knowledgeable staff can help you get beyond the ads and trends and aisles (or pages) of similar-looking toys to find the best ones for your child. The gift of a book can open up a whole new world to a child. One of this year's best options for early-elementary-aged children is Rosie Revere, Engineer, a beautifully illustrated book in which a young girl discovers she has the great ability to invent all kinds of contraptions, including a flying machine. Older children would enjoy any one of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid boxed sets or they can be introduced to The Origami Yoda Files chronicling the adventures of a misfit student at McQuarrie Middle School who folds an origami Yoda who offers sage advice. Books for babies and toddlers should be fun and colorful. Pantone Color Puzzles teach shapes and simple puzzles while teaching colors and Alphablock is a gorgeous book that teaches letters' sound with cut-out letter shapes and lovely illustrations of words that begin with every letter in the alphabet. Lottie Dolls promote a positive image of women and show that girls can do anything from being a black belt in karate to a robot builder -- all without the need for make-up, high heels or unrealistic body proportions and stiff joints. Many of the dolls are based on women from history, teaching the girls (and boys!) who play with them that it's not so far-fetched for there to be a real-life pirate queen. All of the dolls have accessory packs that can be used to expand play possibilities.  Lottie Doll Photo: Lewis Groom ArkluThe best way to get children interested in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) is to get them hands-on building experience. Magna-Tiles are, as the name says, magnetic tiles in a variety of shapes and colors that can be configured nearly any which way to become a doll house, a superhero hideout, a tower that goes up to the ceiling, or a slide for dolls. Magna-Tiles never get boring since they can be re-used over and over again to build nearly any structure you can think of. A great way to get your child's imagination going is by using Rory's StoryCubes. Roll any number of the nine die that come in a pack to come up with a combination of simple pictures you or your child weave into a story. One person can be assigned to tell a story from the beginning up through ""the end"" or every member of the family can collaborate by taking turns incorporating a new picture into the storyline. This is also a great toy for car and plane rides since it's small enough to fit into a purse but has endless possibilities for creating new stories. Art projects are always a great way to get the creative juices flowing. Many art-themed toys beyond basic crayons and paint direct children about what they should create. Creativity Cans, however, give children some raw materials ranging from feathers, to googly eyes, to Styrofoam eggs, to buttons, and let them use their imaginations to create whatever they like from materials they may not have encountered together before. Large cans stuffed full of goodies mean that children can create multiple works of art from one can -- and even the can itself can be incorporated into your child's masterpiece."

Guided by volunteer handlers, nine dogs will roam the terminals, making themselves available for any traveler caught up in airport holiday hullabaloo, offering a bit of comfort to passengers facing flight delays, missed connections and fears of flying. “Carefully selected for their temperament and airport suitability, the dogs will wear vests that read ‘Pet Me!’ identifying dogs of all sizes and breeds by name,” SFO announced.SFO’s Wag Brigade follows similar initiatives at other airports, including the Pets Unstressing Passengers (PUP) program at Los Angeles International Airport and the AmbassaDogs at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport.Further solidifying itself as a dog-loving airport, SFO hosted Virgin America’s ‘Operation Chihuahua’ last month in effort to fly members of the city’s overflowing chihuahua population to new homes in New York.
