(Photo by Josiah Kamau/BuzzFoto/FilmMagic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9da50b2100003100c59b35.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Ransdell PiersonNov 5 (Reuters) - As Jimmy Carter approaches 90, he is reaching for victory in a 15-year war against an infection spread by houseflies that blinds millions in developing countries and posed a threat to his own family and neighbors as a child on a Georgia farm.""Our goal is to eliminate blinding trachoma from the face of the earth by 2020,"" the former U.S. president said during a visit on Tuesday to the New York headquarters of Pfizer Inc , which donates the antibiotic Zithromax used to treat the disease.Trachoma, the world's leading cause of preventable blindness, affects more than 20 million people worldwide, of whom about 2.2 million are visually impaired and 1.2 million are blind, according to the World Health Organization.The disease is caused when houseflies, attracted to the moist eye, spread Chlamydia bacteria. It is spread further through contact with eye discharges on towels, fingers or other infected surfaces.After years of untreated trachoma infections, the eyelids turn inward and scrape the cornea, causing blindness. The disease was eliminated in the United States in the 1970s but is still a threat to an estimated 320 million people worldwide, especially in developing nations, according to Pfizer.Largely through the combined efforts of the Carter Center and an independent nonprofit program called the International Trachoma Initiative co-founded by Pfizer in 1998, blindness associated with the disease may have been eradicated in Morocco and Ghana.But blinding trachoma remains a threat in other developing nations, especially Ethiopia, where almost a third of the population is considered at risk.""When you go to a village, quite often from a distance you see children and think they're wearing eyeglasses,"" Carter said. ""And you get close to them and you see instead of eyeframes, it's a circle of flies around their eyeballs sucking out moisture. That causes the disease and they don't even know that they should wash their faces.""Carter said other necessary elements of controlling the disease, besides routinely washing the face, are surgery, antibiotics and building latrines so human waste does not provide a breeding ground for flies. TRAINING HEALTH WORKERSIn Ethiopia, Carter said his center has helped train more than 30,000 health workers, most of them women, and that half of them have the skills of a licensed practical nurse.He noted that in some African nations, he has had to deal with dictators and corrupt or ineffective ministers who have been at odds with each other or slow to recognize the potential of eliminating blinding trachoma.Especially important, he said, is cooperation from ministers of transportation because many or most villages are practically inaccessible.""These are the kinds of things you have to overcome,"" he said. ""It's a long tedious slow process, but once you teach the top leaders in a country or surrounding village this can be done, there's almost an overwhelming reaction of enthusiasm and cooperation.""The Carter Center, in partnership with national programs, is still trying to eliminate blinding trachoma in the African nations of Mali, Nigeria, Niger and Sudan.Carter said he has been partly motivated by his own childhood memories of trachoma, in rural Georgia.""I was always afflicted with houseflies around my eyes and I had sore eyes almost all the time. My mother happened to be a registered nurse, and so she knew I had to wash my face and try to control the flies, which was almost impossible.""Carter said six families lived on the farm, and his family was the only one with a latrine. ""So I was blessed by being in a family that had the medical knowledge.""Carter in ""retirement"" has also been heavily involved with building houses for the poor through Habitat for Humanity, monitoring elections in nations with histories of fraudulent voting processes and mediating disputes between the U.S. State Dept and volatile foreign leaders.

One such dessert is chocolate cake. Because of this, we're always looking for ways to make our chocolate cakes more moist, more chocolatey, and just more... better.This recipe definitely gets the job done. The secret to this super-moist cake? Good old mayonnaise. We know what you're probably thinking, but trust us, it totally works. Mayo is really just eggs and oil mixed together, so adding some to the batter doesn't actually affect the cake's chocolate flavor. All it does it make everything extra moist, which is pretty cool. See, we're not insane after all. Well, except maybe that time we tried to eat this after finishing a whole pizza.

Now before you start making assumptions, keep reading.",2013-11-04,2013-11-04-545092_10100474640388829_1124831025_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-11-04-545092_10100474640388829_1124831025_n.jpg,"Having been married only a year and a half, I've recently come to the conclusion that marriage isn't for me.Now before you start making assumptions, keep reading.I met my wife in high school when we were 15 years old. We were friends for 10 years until... until we decided no longer wanted to be just friends. I strongly recommend that best friends fall in love. Good times will be had by all.Nevertheless, falling in love with my best friend did not prevent me from having certain fears and anxieties about getting married. The nearer Kim and I approached the decision to marry, the more I was filled with a paralyzing fear. Was I ready? Was I making the right choice? Was Kim the right person to marry? Would she make me happy?Then, one fateful night, I shared these thoughts and concerns with my dad.Perhaps each of us have moments in our lives when it feels like time slows down or the air becomes still and everything around us seems to draw in, marking that moment as one we will never forget.My dad giving his response to my concerns was such a moment for me. With a knowing smile he said, ""Seth, you're being totally selfish. So I'm going to make this really simple: marriage isn't for you. You don't marry to make yourself happy, you marry to make someone else happy. More than that, your marriage isn't for yourself, you're marrying for a family. Not just for the in-laws and all of that nonsense, but for your future children. Who do you want to help you raise them? Who do you want to influence them? Marriage isn't for you. It's not about you. Marriage is about the person you married.""It was in that very moment that I knew that Kim was the right person to marry. I realized that I wanted to make her happy; to see her smile every day, to make her laugh every day. I wanted to be a part of her family, and my family wanted her to be a part of ours. And thinking back on all the times I had seen her play with my nieces, I knew that she was the one with whom I wanted to build our own family.My father's advice was both shocking and revelatory. It went against the grain of today's ""Walmart philosophy"", which is if it doesn't make you happy, you can take it back and get a new one.No, a true marriage (and true love) is never about you. It's about the person you love--their wants, their needs, their hopes, and their dreams. Selfishness demands, ""What's in it for me?"" while Love asks, ""What can I give?""Some time ago, my wife showed me what it means to love selflessly. For many months, my heart had been hardening with a mixture of fear and resentment. Then, after the pressure had built up to where neither of us could stand it, emotions erupted. I was callous. I was selfish.But instead of matching my selfishness, Kim did something beyond wonderful -- she showed an outpouring of love. Laying aside all of the pain and anguish I had caused her, she lovingly took me in her arms and soothed my soul.Marriage is about family.I realized that I had forgotten my dad's advice. While Kim's side of the marriage had been to love me, my side of the marriage had become all about me. This awful realization brought me to tears, and I promised my wife that I would try to be better.To all who are reading this article -- married, almost married, single, or even the sworn bachelor or bachelorette -- I want you to know that marriage isn't for you. No true relationship of love is for you. Love is about the person you love.And, paradoxically, the more you truly love that person, the more love you receive. And not just from your significant other, but from their friends and their family and thousands of others you never would have met had your love remained self-centered.Truly, love and marriage isn't for you. It's for others.Seth Adam Smith is an Alaskan-born blogger and the editor-in-chief of ForwardWalking.com. This post first appeared on his website, sethadamsmith.com"
