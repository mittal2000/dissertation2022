I imagine his graduation will feature a keynote speaker who will give sage advice to the graduating students.I was thinking about what I would say if I was addressing my son and his classmates, charged with imparting wisdom to that excited group of young people in front of me. I'd start with four simple words: I hope you fail. Failure is a very powerful force. It's in experiencing failure that we all learn, and if we are resilient and recognize the role failure has in our lives, we ultimately become the person we are meant to be, doing what we are meant to do. Failure is the path to wisdom. We've seen it time and time again. Steve Jobs was fired from Apple, the company he founded, at the age of 30. As he recounts in the commencement speech he gave at Stanford University in 2008:I was a public failure... I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.Michael Jordan, considered by many to be the greatest basketball player of all time, failed to make the basketball team the first time he tried out in high school. Guess what he attributes his ultimate success to? ""I've missed more than 9,000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. Twenty-six times I've been trusted to take the game-winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.""The challenge is that we live in a culture that glorifies success and demonizes failure. We pay homage to those who achieve remarkable results, often giving them more credit than they actually deserve. (Nobody is successful on their own, and almost all successful endeavors have benefited from more than their share of good luck.) Conversely, we vilify public failures. And when we treat failure as anything other than a normal part of life and an incredible opportunity for growth and wisdom, we send a terrible message to our children and young adults. We teach them to play it safe in a world that demands innovation and risk-taking. We encourage them to think of each life failure as a reflection of their character and ability, as opposed to an incredible learning opportunity.There are places in our country where failure is indeed being de-stigmatized, as it should be. In an article in the New York Times, ""The Power of Failure,"" Wayan Vota, a technology and information expert said, ""In Silicon Valley, failure is a rite of passage. If you're not failing, you're not considered to be innovating enough."" So to Daniel and all the new grads out there, I hope you fail. And if you don't succeed the next time, follow the advice of the Irish playwright and novelist Samuel Beckett. ""Try again. Fail again. Fail better.""GVFA 2013 XXXX DOFU 5/2013"

As often the case, I'm called in after a plethora of other approaches have been attempted, many of them following a negative reinforcement protocol to detrimental ends. Here is a page from this week's roster.Meet Carly, a chocolate fuzz ball with paws. At two years of age, this Cockapoo is the adoration of her family, having been campaigned for by the husband and kids and reluctantly agreed to by mom Ann, she was now woven into the tapestry of their life-like an heirloom carpet. The frustrations that had prompted Ann's call to me? She listed them in succeeding order: Excessive barking at the windows, frantic fear around loud noises that prevented her socialization and inclusion and aggressive behavior with strangers. Though reluctant to call a professional, after a bad experience with a different dog trainer, a veterinarian at Millwood Animal Hospital reassured her that in addition to a dog trainer, I am an applied animal behaviorist who uses positive reinforcement -- with both dogs and people! During the first phone call I learned that the last trainer -- part of a franchised group that promises lifelong follow-up but with whom Ann distanced herself from after two lessons -- had labeled Carly as ""Dominant Aggressive."" The trainer offered a chain bag to toss when Carly barked at the first lesson, but when that didn't work, he pulled out an electronic shock collar. Ann's intuition was spot on -- she knew this quick fix wasn't the answer.During our first talk, Ann lamented about what she saw as aggressive behavior, and dropped the word ""dominance"" into the conversation more than a few times. I paused to consider it. Were Carly's aggressive reactions a sign of dominant behavior? A few quick questions revealed the answer. ""Does Carly growl or show possessiveness over her food, toys, or sleeping areas?"" No, not at all. She's fine with all of that.""Does Carly lunge at people or other dogs when you walk her on leash?"" No. Quite the opposite, she might bark if they're passing by, but she looks confused. If the dog comes towards us she will pull back to the house or car. ""Is she assertive with you, blocking you on the stairs or barking at you for food or play?"" No... she rings a bell to go outside -- does that count?""When Carly becomes noise sensitive what does she do?"" She wants to run and hide. Yes -- she's so afraid of loud noises she often retreats to her crate or will struggle to run home or back to the car.""As a puppy I'm guessing she was quiet, loving, and easily startled."" Yes -- that is right. All of the above! It's as though you've met her before.My assessment? I didn't think there was a dominant bone in Carly's body. She sounded like a loving, needy, mildly anxious personality type who was easily shaken by unfamiliar activity or unpredicted events. Subjected to negative reinforcement training, Carly had begun to second guess her own impulses and develop reactionary behavior that had little to do with the dog she really was. Her personality was gentle and worrisome, and instead of bolstering her confidence the pressure of avoiding corrections has left her sanity shaken. Could I help Ann and Carly find a better path? I couldn't wait to sink my teeth in, metaphorically speaking!Anyone who's used me as a trainer will attest to my unorthodox approach. Arriving at the home, I ring the bell and stand to the side of the door. When opened, it looks more like a prank than an official visit. Where am I and why am I hiding? If you look at this from Carly's perspective, the home is equivalent to a den and the door is its opening. For Carly, who has developed stranger anxiety, her fears are realized the moment the door is opened and a looming figure fills the frame. This time, however, I changed the game plan by disappearing from view. What did Carly do? Well at first she continued barking (her bell-bark behavior would've made Pavlov smile).  But then she paused. After about 20 seconds I saw her nose tentatively reaching around the door frame. When her face beheld mine I was down on her level, sitting with my back against the house and my nose shoved into a bag of Chikables Combo Bites dog treats I was unassuming, relaxed, and completely engrossed. What did she do? She sniffed me head to toe, then pawed my arm for recognition and a treat. I made a new friend! In the house, Carly cavorted with glee, bringing her toys to me and jumping into my lap to offer me a lick. Ann, who'd be watching in awe, reached for a bottle filled with coins to shake and startle her dog from jumping on me. I raised my hand to stop her. ""I appreciate that you're trying to teach her not to jump, but there is a better way,"" I promised. I further explained when hesitant dogs finally feel comfortable enough to socialize, they sometimes go a little over board, getting jumpy and mouthy. While a coin bottle might work wonders for other dogs, it will instill fear with a sensitive dog such as Carly. I urged a different approach and vowed she'd see results within 24 hours.How'd we do it? I helped Ann recognize that Carly's brain is similar to a 14-month-old child--full of wonder, desire, and unconditional adoration. Negative training creates so much stress that while it may solve one problem, such as jumping, it creates other problems far more troubling, like aggression or frantic barking.Ann and I worked to link recognizable words and everyday routines to help bolster Carly's self-confidence and focus. This simple exercise would take no extra time but would do wonders for her outlook. ""Outside,"" ""Inside,"" ""Upstairs,"" ""Dinner"" would involve her in household on-goings. In addition we taught her a word for her favorite toy ""Binky!"" and chew ""Bone!"" and used those words to redirect her. Finally we introduced a brand new routine, ""Say Hello!"" An essential routine for any well socialized dog or puppy; you can teach this easily by tucking food rewards into your fist and extending them to your dog as you command, ""Say Hello!"" It didn't take long for Carly to make the food-in-hand association, and soon she was so excited by the direction that we used it to direct her to strangers. Though I'm often called the miracle worker, it's the dogs that always impress me. The most forgiving and trusting of all the earth's creatures, I'm left in awe of their healing abilities. Carly took to our new regime like she'd been hoping for it. She learned new words and overcame her stranger anxiety with so much zeal that a neighbor commented she simply couldn't be the same dog. And while Carly will always have a sensitive temperament, prone to nervous reaction to the unknown, Ann's effort to redirect her as opposed to correct her, has given the whole family a new leash on life... literally!"

Because I don't want information at my fingertips -- I want action at my fingertips, and I mean my fingertips.The Web 2.0 is all about the big providers: Google, Amazon, Facebook, Ebay, Paypal. They gift us with search and services, they make available products, they enable us to get in touch with our friends. And while they face competition, they operate for their benefit not ours. They own our identities -- the credentials we use to pay for goods and services. Only Facebook provides a platform that enables user extensions, and only within strict limitations. The big providers give us the services they want and that they approve of. Why can't you download your entire Kindle library from Amazon with a single button? Google abandoned Google Reader -- what service that we have come to depend on will they abandon next? Google Voice? Where will that leave people who have grown dependent on that service?The big providers give us information; buying; delivering -- even with Amazon's Mechanical Turk a market for labor. But they aren't integrated. There are many services they don't provide. We have still to wait in lines; to fill out forms; to print and deliver them. Our world isn't integrated with Turbotax -= and the U.S. government is blocked from providing online tax services by the Turbotax lobbyists.What we need for the Web 3.0 is Googazon. A kind of Wikipedia of goods and services. A Google, Amazon, Facebook, Ebay, Paypal, and more that belongs to us. A place to build a reputation. An open extensible integrated platform that small businesses - and large - can plug into to provide us with goods and services. A place where sellers, workers, service providers happily compete for our business. Forms that record our experiences and share them with the community so the next person who fills out the form knows the quirks and tricks to success. Screen-scrapers to integrate those foolish enough to resist. Software that will be us -- that will act as our agent. A guarantee for the long run where the software is free (as in freedom), access is open, and competitors are allowed and even encouraged.The heart of any commercial system is trust: sellers want to know that they will get paid and buyers want to know that they will get the goods and services they paid for. The key to trust is reputation -- and the crucial service of certifying your reputation is what your Amazon, Google, and Paypal accounts do for you. But: they own your accounts and your data. How is Amazon able to charge a 15 percent commission on sales through its Market Place? Because they provide their sellers with access to your account information and you with access to the seller's reputation. In Googazon the principle is: your reputation and your data belong to you. You provide your information to whom you like and deny it to those you dislike. In Googazon the big providers can't charge for access to your information and buyers and sellers are free to compete for your business.Make no mistake -- Googazon has the potential for revolution. Imagine that next time you have to get a dozen permits to remodel your apartment or register your car all the forms are online and when you go to fill them in the experience of all the other form-fillers pop up to help you. Where there is a link to hire someone -- with proven reliable experience -- to take the forms and wait in line for you. Where contractors bid for the job. Where corrupt government officials are exposed for what they are.Or take it the other way around: I have unemployed friends who work through casual networks at small tasks ranging from babysitting dogs to caring for the elderly. It isn't much of a business -- reputation is word of mouth, and advertising doesn't exist. Why can't they establish their reputation and their business on Googazon? Why can't you click an app on your phone to find a reliable dog-sitter -- or babysitter? Why can't a reliable person with a few days between jobs and in need of a few dollars not pick up some work from an equally reliable stranger? Why isn't this integrated with the rest of our lives?And why can't the software driving Googazon be driven by the free software model of GNU/Linux and Firefox? Why can't the user with programming skills contribute to plugin modules to make it work better for all of us? Why can't there be communities of common interest developing and integrating this software in a common framework? In short: why don't we take back the Internet?So I say again: let the next Stallman, Torvalds or Wales step up and build us Googazon -- the user driven Web 3.0."

The European Union's decision to recapitalize Cypriot banks by inflicting losses on depositors and senior bondholders is triggering investor concern about the knock-on effects for bank funding across the region. Photographer: Jason Alden/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2f3bb24000051009735fa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Lawrence SummersMay 5 (Reuters) - The economics commentariat and no small part of the political debate in recent weeks has been consumed with the controversy surrounding the work of my Harvard colleagues (and friends) Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff (RR).Their work had been widely interpreted as establishing that economic growth was likely to stagnate in a country once its government debt-to-GDP ratio exceeded 90 percent.Scholars at the University of Massachusetts have demonstrated and RR have acknowledged that they made a coding error that resulted in their omitting some relevant data in forming their results and also have noted that using updated data for several countries reduces substantially the strength of some of the statistical patterns they asserted. Issues have also arisen with respect to how RR weighted observations in forming the averages on which they base their conclusions.Many have said that the questions raised undermine the claims of austerity advocates around the world that deficits should be quickly reduced. Some have gone so far as to blame RR for the unemployment of millions, asserting that they provided crucial intellectual ammunition for austerity policies.Others believe that even after re-analysis the data support the view that deficit and debt burden reduction is important in most of the industrialized world. Still others regard the controversy as calling into question the usefulness of statistical research on economic policy questions.Where should these debates settle? From the perspective of someone who has done a fair amount of econometric research, consumed such research as a policymaker and participated as an advocate in debates about fiscal stimulus and austerity, here would be my takeaways.First, the RR experience should accelerate the evolution of mores with respect to economic research. Rogoff and Reinhart are rightfully regarded as careful, honest scholars. Anyone close to the process of economic research will recognize that data errors like the ones they made are distressingly common. Indeed the JP Morgan risk models in use when the ""London Whale"" trade was placed had errors not unlike those made by RR.In the future, authors and journals and commentators need to devote more effort to replicating significant results before broadcasting them widely. More generally, no important policy conclusion should ever be based solely on a single statistical result. Policy judgments should be based on the accumulation of evidence from multiple studies done with differing methodological approaches.Even then, there should be a reluctance to accept conclusions from ""models"" without an intuitive understanding of what is driving them. It is right and understandable that scholars want their findings to inform the policy debate. But they have an obligation to discourage and on occasion contradict those who would oversimplify and exaggerate their conclusions.Second, all participants in policy debates should retain a healthy skepticism about retrospective statistical analysis. Trillions of dollars have been lost and millions have been unemployed because the lesson learned from 60 years of experience between 1945 and 2005 was that ""American house prices in aggregate always go up."" This was no data problem or misanalysis. It was a data regularity until it wasn't.The extrapolation from past experience to future outlook is always deeply problematic and needs to be done with great care. In retrospect, it was folly to believe that with data on about 30 countries it was possible to estimate a threshold beyond which debt became dangerous. Even if such a threshold existed, why should it be the same in countries with and without their own currency, with very different financial systems, cultures, degrees of openness and growth experiences? And there is the chestnut that correlation does not establish causation and any tendency for high debt and low growth to go together reflects the debt accumulation that follows from slow growth.Third, while RR's work, even unqualified by the recent replication efforts, did not support the claims made by the prominent figures on the right in the U.S. and UK regarding the urgency of deficit reduction efforts, much of the joy taken on the left in their embarrassment is inappropriate.It is absurd to blame them for austerity policies. The authors of those policies chose the policies first and only then cast about for intellectual ballast.While there may be no threshold beyond which debt automatically becomes catastrophic, and while the British and American experiences are both suggesting that fiscal contraction in a slack economy where interest rates are near zero is inimical to growth, it is a grave mistake to suppose that the debt can or should be accumulated with abandon.On all but the most optimistic forecasts, further actions will be necessary almost everywhere in the industrial world to assure that debt levels are sustainable after economies recover.Now is not the time for austerity, but we forget at our peril that debt-financed spending is not an alternative to cutting other spending or raising taxes but only a way of deferring these painful acts."

Meanwhile, the cognoscenti headed out to Walnut Creek where Diablo Ballet was closing out its 19th season with an impeccably curated mixed bill, capped by a delightful improvisation masterminded by Artistic Director Lauren Jonas and KGO 7 news anchor Dan Ashley, who roped in the audience to choreograph a brief pas de deux for dancers Hiromi Yamazaki and Derek Sakakura. The resulting opus -- a romantic encounter between a construction worker and a businesswoman at a busy BART station -- may not remain in Diablo Ballet's repertoire for long, but it was magical while it lasted.Yamazaki and Robert Dekkers kicked the program into high gear with the pas de deux from George Balanchine's rousing Stars and Stripes, a 1958 tribute to Balanchine's adoptive country, set to John Philip Sousa. Yamazaki and Dekkers wisely resisted the urge to ham it up, but instead gave us a crisp and vivacious reading of this marriage between classical Russian technique and Rockettes showmanship. Her sparkling footwork and surefooted balances, his buoyant jumps and skillful partnering made light of the many technique challenges. Our favorite moment was an exuberant series of partnered pirouettes during which she thrust her leg out into arabesque, which he nimbly had to avoid while keeping her on her balance.Tina Kay Bohnstedt's new work From Another Time was a mysterious, absorbing glimpse into a dream world, set to a plaintive piano score composed and played live by local pianist Justin Levitt. At the end of the program, Levitt gave us a captivating explanation of how he felt the music evoked a bygone era in the Russia of his ancestors. There was a sense of foreboding throughout the piece, and the suggestion of the fragility of human bonds, as Jennifer Friel Dille, Rosselyn Ramirez, David Fonnegra, Derek Sakakura and Edward Stegge made momentary passionate connections that inevitably disintegrated. Although the technique was classical, the footwork was grounded deeply into the floor, the dancers weighed down by an unseen burden. Robert Dekkers contributed the other world premiere to this program - a tempestuous ensemble piece accented with wit and humor, which stirred up much debate between Ballet To The People and her date on the drive home. The title See Saw struck her literally as a juxtaposition of present and past tense, along with many steps and gestures that seemed to indicate that we were on some kind of hunt, either a historical treasure hunt (the cast at one point appeared to be reading from elaborate imaginary maps or ancient scrolls) or perhaps a search for a criminal gang on the run, as they whipped out imaginary guns. Ballet To The People's date shot down this Hollywood B-movie interpretation, preferring to see the dance as a more abstract expression of internal conflict, of man's search for a simpler life in these chaotic times. Meaning aside, the dance was a profoundly musical response to the score, a Mendelssohn trio for violin, cello and piano, stirringly played by Phyllis Kamrin, Amy Brodo and Ian Scarfe. Both new works are so rich in imagination that one viewing hardly sufficed to absorb all the fascinating details. An angst-ridden duet from KT Nelson's They've Lost Their Footing, first created for Diablo Ballet in 1999, rounded out the program. It opens with the striking Mayo Sugano flattened against the back wall, writhing in desperation. The claustrophobic setting would appear to be some kind of detox facility, the tortured score by Swedish folk-metal-rockers Hoven Droven a rendering of the horrors inside Sugano's head. (Though, having never seen the full-length work, Ballet To The People could be jumping to the wrong conclusion, unduly influenced perhaps by the spate of urgent news flashes from the Huffington Post that landed in her inbox this morning, updating her on the latest crisis in Lindsay Lohan's flirtation with rehab.) A little later on, Sugano is joined by a menacing Robert Dekkers, who might well be her pusher. These two proceed to destroy each other in a contemporary dance vocabulary that appears somewhat dated today. Modern urban nightmares like this might be even more powerful if the ballerina were costumed in a tutu and the score ripped from a Handel opera. Within this program, however, They've Lost Their Footing provided an intriguing counterpoint and a tribute to the physical and artistic range of this tiny, spunky company.The poor sightlines at the Shadelands Auditorium and the tight stage quarters are not an ideal setting for dance, but the Diablo Ballet dancers are so skilled that we do not feel they are holding anything back. It is a thrill for the audience to be so close to the performers, and nothing short of miraculous in these trying economic times to be treated to performances and live music of such high caliber."

He cheated!""",2013-05-04,bright picture of pretty woman with hands over mouth,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d18012200005700d97d75.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Your friend calls you in the middle of the night, crying. She sniffles and barely manages to say, ""He did it again. He cheated!"" You hold your breath because you aren't sure what to say. You want to say the right thing. However, what comes out may be the the worst thing you can say. Right now, your friend or loved one is in a crisis. They just found out that their partner cheated. Sure, there are things they want to hear. And you want to say them, because you want to comfort your friend. And you want to let your friend know that you are there for him or her in their misery. But trust me, if you say the wrong thing now, it could come back to bite you later on. And some things you say could be even worse -- you could lose your friendship forever. Do you want to really help them? Here are the things you should never say to a friend who's been cheated on:Leave. This is the worst thing that you can say. When someone shares with you that they've been cheated on, they are basically opening up and sharing one of the most vulnerable and defeated moments of their life. It makes sense that you might tell them to leave. But when you first find out that your spouse or partner has cheated, whether it's disclosed or discovered, the last thing you should be doing is making a decision about what you want to do in the long term. In fact, if you want to give better advice to your friend right now, say to them them, ""Don't make any decisions right now. Wait until the major feelings blow over.""Tell them this: It's important in this time of crisis to feel safe and to take care of one's health and safety. Find a place to sleep if you can't be in the same bed as your partner and take care of your health by remembering to eat and drink plenty of water. And remember that what you are feeling now is not what you are going to feel a few days or even a few months from now. Now is not the time to make any major decisions about your future. Moving out, breaking up or filing for divorce now may make it even harder later on.Once a cheater always a cheater. That's just not true. Many affairs happen because of opportunity. And in fact, many relationships can be sound, happy and healthy and affairs still happen. And cheating partners may be very remorseful and willing to do anything they can to repair afterward. What may be more helpful to hear right now is that many relationships are stronger than ever after an affair. It may not be clear right away if this relationship will make it or not, but if you are really a friend trying to give advice, what gives you the right to tell someone that if their partner cheats, they will always do it again? How do you know?Men are such pigs. Or the equivalent: Women are such sluts. It's not helpful to classify someone's most important partner as just one of a whole group of unwholesome and awful people. Inferring that one's partner has no integrity, cannot be trusted and, in fact, is a lowly, awful person with no redeeming qualities may feel good in the moment, but if your friend ends up staying with that person, they will never want to look you in the eye again and you may end up not only losing your friend, but creating an enemy.They should have just left you first. That's easy for you to say. The person being cheated on didn't want to be cheated on. What makes you think it's easier to hear that they should have been dumped instead? How would being broken up with have made their life any better? In fact, they probably don't want their partner to end their marriage or relationship, so you saying that it would have been better to divorce is going to sound like the ultimate insult. It is incredibly patronizing for a friend or loved one to assume that ending a marriage or committed partnership is better than being cheated on. Yes, being cheated on feels awful, but how is being dumped going to feel any better? You'll meet someone better. Don't try and move your friend onto someone else or something else too soon. They aren't ready and they don't want to be. And no, they shouldn't have a ""revenge"" affair. Don't take your friend out to meet someone else. Don't encourage them to cheat to ""get even."" If they do that, then they will just have to get over two affairs: their partner's and their own.So what do you say when to a friend that's been cheated on? You are allowed to have your own feelings, but let your friend know that they are yours: ""I am so mad and upset that this happened to you. It's hard for me to forgive what they did to you right now. I am so upset for you.""Do yourself and them a favor: Be supportive by listening, being empathetic and validating their feelings. This might sound like, ""I am so sorry you are going through this. It must feel awful right now. I understand that you are feeling so sad and angry. It sounds like you are feeling terrible. What can I do right now to help? What do you need from me? ""Perhaps the most important way to support a friend after infidelity is to simply let them know, ""I love you and I am here for you. (Even if you can't resist throwing in a one-time ""...Whether you stay with that cheating s-o-b or not."")Dr. Tammy Nelson is a world renowned sex and relationship expert and the author of The New Monogamy and Getting the Sex You Want.
