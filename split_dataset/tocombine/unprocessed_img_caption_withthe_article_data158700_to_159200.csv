(Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d014a2100003100c55921.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Two days after announcing he was taking a ""leave of presence"" because of a cancer recurrence, iconic film critic Roger Ebert has died at age 70, the Chicago Sun-Times reported. The Chicago Tribune reported that Ebert, who was hospitalized last December after he broke his hip, wrote online on Tuesday that ""the 'painful fracture' that made it difficult for me to walk has recently been revealed to be a cancer. It is being treated with radiation, which has made it impossible for me to attend as many movies as I used to."" It is unclear so far what kind of cancer Ebert had been diagnosed with before his death; he had previously been diagnosed with thyroid and salivary gland cancer, but there are no reports as to whether one of these cancers came back, or if a new cancer developed. The Chicago Tribune reported that Ebert was first diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2002, and salivary gland cancer in 2003. Doctors found cancer in his jaw in 2006, which necessitated the removal of the lower part of his jaw. But a complication after this procedure -- which caused the bursting of his carotid artery -- led to more surgeries, including a tracheostomy that ultimately took away his voice, Esquire reported. According to the 2010 profile in Esquire, Ebert has gone through so many surgical procedures that he and his wife have lost official count:He believes he’s had three more surgeries since the removal of his lower jaw; Chaz remembers four. Each time, however many times, surgeons carved bone and tissue and skin from his back, arm and legs and transplanted them in an attempt to reconstruct his jaw and throat. Each time, he had one or two weeks of hope and relief when he could eat a little and drink a little and talk a little. Once, the surgery looked nearly perfect. (“Like a movie star,” Chaz remembers.) But each time, the reconstructive work fell apart and had to be stripped out, the hole opened up again.At the beginning of 2011, Ebert debuted a collar-like silicone prosthetic chin and new voice technology from CereProc, according to ABC News. ""We wanted to design a prosthesis that would elevate his lower jaw or chin area,"" University of Illinois Medical Center's Dr. David Reisberg, who was part of the team that developed Ebert's chin, told ABC News. ""It wasn't so much because he wanted to look better, but he felt that other people would be more comfortable dealing with him.""In the wake of his death, Ebert's candidness with his cancer is lauded. Dr. Michael Neuss, who is the chief medical officer at Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, told ABC News that Ebert ""broadened our understanding of cancer based on his incredible courage and incredible strength and genuine demeanor through this tough time. ... It has to show people that we do treat cancer patients and that things do happen, but you keep going."" And Matthew Herper, who covers medicine for Forbes, called Ebert a ""voice for all those who face cancer bravely."" "

2,PARENTING,Why Paying for Your Child's College Education Isn't Giving Them a 'Free Ride',"Mara Shapiro, Contributor

The difference between the two rates adds up to $6 billion. (AP Photo/Paul Sakuma, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d011b2200005700d975b9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The cost of a post-secondary education is a hot topic. Tuition fees continue to rise, and student debts are crippling new grads. The big question to me is, who should pay for school? Should parents do their best to cover their kids' educations, or should students pony up, cobbling together the funds through part-time jobs, grants and loans, possibly putting themselves in financial straits for years?Recently, I read an article on Today's Parent where the author laid out her reasons for requiring her kids to kick in for their own post-secondary educations. I disagreed with most of the author's points, but couldn't argue that young adults to take some responsibility for their fiscal situations, if only to teach them the basics of budgeting. What really bothered me, more than the concept, because every family is free to do what works for them, was the title: ""Why My Kids Won't Get a Free Ride to University."" These words implied to me that providing my children with the best start in life that I can afford is in fact doing something gratuitous for them, something they don't deserve, that they haven't earned. I've got three teenagers. One already in university, one in the 11th grade, and one just finishing primary school. And, to the best of my ability, I intend to pay for their post-secondary educations. (Yes, I faint every time I think about it.)My Dad, who passed away a couple of years ago, valued education above anything else. Growing up, his question was never ""Are you going to University?"", but rather, ""Where are you going to go and what are you going to take?"" He paid to educate four of us through undergraduate degrees (and several college courses for my youngest sister), and went so far as to help two of us out with post-graduate degrees too. Even when I was 40 years old, he'd call me up and ask me if I wanted to go to Teacher's College, get a Master's Degree, take a course. If it was learning, he was willing to spring for it.My Dad was no kind of deep pockets, though. He wouldn't buy us expensive clothing or fancy vacations. He did like a nice meal, but didn't squander money unnecessarily. However, an education was not an area he was open to scrimping on.What a gift he gave all of us children. What an amazing start to our adult lives.That's why I find it interesting to hear about so many parents who do not believe in paying for their kids' educations, even if they can afford it. Especially if they can afford it.I am not even sure if I can afford it and I want to help my kids out. And this is why:I don't want them to start their adult lives with debt. According to this article in Macleans Magazine, it costs on average $80,000 for a student to obtain a four-year degree (I can attest to that, as I have the bills from my daughter's first year, and they added up to $18,000), and most graduate with extensive student debt. For many, the path to repayment will be at least 14 years, taking them into their mid-30s before their Bachelor's degrees are paid off (forget professional or Master's degrees). The statistics for student debt are even more overwhelming for Americans. Why in the world would I do that to my child? What kind of lesson is that?Don't borrow when you can pay in cash. My Dad imbued in me an intense dislike of interest, unless it's the kind you're receiving. I have had 18 years to save up for my kids' educations with the ability to leverage compound interest and 20% government contributions into their RESPs. Student loans may be easy to get, but there is interest attached. Instead of paying out the percentages, bring them in. Take off $10 per paycheck, per child, and bank those decades of birthday, Christmas and Chanukah cheques. Save for their future just like you would save for your own retirement.Teach a child to appreciate something and they won't take it for granted. My kids grew up in a middle-class lifestyle. They know that lots of families have more, but even more have much less. Being gifted with an education is just that -- a gift. And one that is accompanied by expectations, such as how they are to comport themselves and what they are to achieve. Just like all of our parenting, we let them know what's expected of them, and we don't pussyfoot around them. There's no 'free ride' in this house, but rather a deserved result of something they have worked very hard for.University is a life experience as well as a learning experience. I truly believe that teenagers benefit from living away from home when they're taking a degree or diploma. Campus life, parties, dorm life, roommates, finding a house, apartment, managing time, budgeting, preparing meals -- these are all part of college life. To me, unless the student really isn't ready to leave home, going away for school is a necessary part of the separation process, especially in these days of helicopter parenting. So, half the money goes to tuition, and the other half goes to living expenses (unless you're living it up a little too much, like I did, and then you're coming home. Which I did. See point above.)Now, before you think I'm all kinds of spendthrift and that my progeny have no idea about the value of a dollar, these kids do have to contribute. My daughter worked two jobs last summer and saved a ton of money to feed her shopping habits. And, she's already been told that she needs to work part-time starting in second year. But, I just don't feel like hardship makes you stronger, or more appreciative.So, just like my father, we may not pay for designer jeans, expensive lipgloss or concert tickets. But, we do pay for university (or college, or music school, or trade school...)Because to us, when it comes to our children's futures, we truly believe that a Penny Wise is a Pound Foolish.Originally published on momfaze.photo credit: MomMaven via photopin cc"

In recession-hit Europe, however, French and Italian tourists reined in their holiday budgets.""The impressive growth of tourism expenditure from China and Russia reflects the entry into the tourism market of a growing middle class from these countries,"" said UNWTO Secretary-General Taleb Rifai.The German Travel Association (DRV) said it was to be expected that the Chinese would eventually overtake Germans in terms of spending, given that the country had more inhabitants than North America, Russia and Europe put together.""But that they have overtaken us already is astonishing,"" DRV president Juergen Buechy said.The Chinese make more long-haul trips than Germans, who typically go to Mediterranean destinations, meaning that the average spend per holiday was greater, he added. CATCHING UPChina is the world's fastest growing tourist source market, thanks to higher disposable incomes in the world's number two economy and looser foreign travel restrictions. Chinese tourists made 83 million foreign trips in 2012, compared to 10 million in 2000.Hoteliers, tour companies, restaurants and even taxi drivers will need to brush up on their knowledge of Chinese cuisine, culture and language if they are to tempt them away from favourite destinations like Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Maldives, European tourism officials have said.Other countries in the top 10 including Japan and Australia posted growth in travel spending, though only Russia came close to China's huge growth, with a 32 percent increase in holiday budgets.Russians are now the fifth highest-spending tourists, parting with $43 billion last year, according to the Madrid-based UNWTO, and catching up on the British, who spent $52 billion in 2012.Italian spending dipped by 1 percent to $26 billion in 2012 and French tourists parted with $38 billion, a 6 percent drop year-on-year. The two euro zone peers were the only countries in the top 10 outbound markets to post declines."

You can start out of the gate frenzied, frantic, and flummoxed or confident, cheerful, and calm. Which way sounds more appealing to you?You may not realize it, but you have a spa-like respite right in your very own home: the shower. And in that shower, you can find bliss. I'm not talking about tantric sex in the shower with your partner (although if that brings you bliss, by all means, go for it). I'm talking about using shower time as a moment to intentionally reduce your stress and start your day with more ""ahh"" and less ""ugh.""Use one or more of these shortcuts to inner peace to calm your body and your mind:1. Let Go: As you're rinsing off your body, name three things that are troubling you. Say, ""I release this worry,"" and imagine it washing off of you and going down the drain. Trigger your body's relaxation response by heaving a big sigh of relief and then let the water carry away your concerns.2. Gratitude: If you've ever been to a country without indoor plumbing -- or a youth hostel with limited hot water -- you'll know that your shower is a modern miracle. Be grateful that you can step into a tiled sanctuary, turn a knob, and have hot water rain upon you. Let your gratitude sink in deep and it will change the trajectory of your day.3. Mindfulness: Bring your attention to all of the sensations on your body. Feel the water cascading on to your skin. Feel your hand on the soap. Feel your toes gripping the floor. Be completely present in your senses and notice how your mind clears and your body relaxes.4. Inhale: Let the scents around you stimulate your imagination. Smell the tropical fusion shampoo, the honey citrus bath wash, the ocean breeze conditioner. Your shower is a veritable aroma therapy treasure trove. Redirect your mind to a place and time of calm and relaxation. Close your eyes and let each scent take you away.5. Open Heart: Use the shower to generate loving feelings. Imagine the love that another has for you raining down with each drop of water. Maybe today you know and feel how your grandma loves you, your dog loves you, your partner loves you, or your kids love you (unless they're teenagers!). Saturate yourself in that love and feel your heart opening. Face your day with a heart full of love and all things will go smoother.6. Sing: It may be cliché, but singing in the shower will lift your spirits and turn your day around! Choose a song that makes you smile and warms your heart. Try a holiday song, a top hit from your high school days or a ditty from summer camp long ago. Use this time honored tradition to shift your mood while the water calms your body.With these six tips, you may find that shower time is the best part of your day. But don't stay in there too long, a fresh day awaits.For more by Ashley Davis Bush, LCSW, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."

Facebook announced Monday, June 25, 2012, it has named its No. 2 executive, Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, to its board of directors. Sandberg, who joined Facebook from Google in 2008, is the first woman on Facebook's board of directors. (AP Photo/Keystone, Laurent Gillieron, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cfd462200005600d97463.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Whether or not the timing of Susan Patton's letter to the editor of the Daily Princetonian was intentional or coincidental, it certainly appears to fly in the face of author Sheryl Sandberg's newly released book, Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead. Interesting enough, Sheryl's Lean In advice provides the perfect segue to understanding the seemingly divergent messages of these two women, i.e. ""reflecting someone's viewpoint clarifies the disagreement and becomes a starting point for resolution.""Susan Patton's message to the women at Princeton University was to find a husband at Princeton before they graduated college. However, just like Sheryl, Susan's viewpoint evolved from her personal experiences. While at Princeton, Susan claims she openly acknowledged she wanted to get married and have children. Although her letter doesn't address whether she also desired a career outside of the home, it clearly asserts that an intellectual woman will have a difficult time finding an equally intellectual man after college graduation. Reading between the lines, it appears as though Susan's viewpoint is a reflection of not marrying a man of equal intelligence, and now being a statistic of divorce. Although both Susan and Sheryl acknowledge that a woman's future and happiness is significantly impacted by the man she marries, Susan's letter correlates a happy marriage to the sole factor of intellect. On the contrary, Sheryl acknowledges the difficulties of marriage, and the importance of being true partners. As the saying goes, a person's perception is their reality. This reality is often dramatically altered after a divorce, and provides a person the opportunity to go back and play the game ""what I should have done."" Susan's viewpoint wasn't that women should get married before they graduate. Rather, it was that during college, Princeton women should find Princeton men to be their future husbands, as they are of equal intellect, and men of equal intellect will be harder to find after college. Susan's viewpoint not only emphasizes the societal pressure of women finding a husband and getting married, but also compounds the pressure by telling women they need to find that husband in college. Although Sheryl didn't succumb to the pressure of marriage until she was 24, I feel confident she would not support adding to the already existent pressure. However, surprisingly enough, I do believe Susan and Sheryl actually share some of the same viewpoints. I think Sheryl would agree a true partnership requires a similar level of intelligence. In addition, the concept that an intellectual woman can be intimidating to men is a concept readily recognized by Sheryl, as she herself acknowledged she didn't want others to know she was voted most likely to succeed in high school.A fatal flaw in Susan's advice is ignoring the reality that personal growth after college is significant. Even though there are some men who may be interested in finding their forever mate in college, the larger percentage are more interested in sowing their wild oats. The goals, desires, interests and maturity level of both men and women in their twenties are ever changing. How is a woman supposed to find a husband when the potential husband is still trying to find himself? More importantly, how is a woman to find a husband when she is still trying to find herself?Susan's message about the importance of finding a husband with a similar intellect is a good message. However, it is just one of many factors that will lead to a marriage being an equal partnership. Perhaps the resolution of these ostensibly different views is to concentrate on the traits that are important if a person desires to marry versus the timing of looking for those traits."
8,WELLNESS,Bunion Laser Treatment: Is It Possible?,"Dr. Neal Blitz, Contributor
NYC & Beverly Hills Foot & Ankle Surgeon",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bunion-treatment_us_5b9cfc70e4b03a1dcc838b01,"If you are looking for the most modern techniques in bunion surgery, laser is not currently the best option.  What is encouraging is that bunion surgery has changed dramatically in the past few years as surgeons are more focused on both the aesthetic and functional result.",2013-04-03,2013-04-02-BunionSurgeryBeforeandAfterDrBlitz2.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-04-02-BunionSurgeryBeforeandAfterDrBlitz2.jpg,"In my Manhattan bunion surgery practice, patients frequently inquire about laser bunion removal. Because lasers are often associated with advanced techniques in medicine, most people assume that a laser can zap away their bunion, even though many patients are not exactly sure what a bunion is or what a laser can accomplish. It is my experience that patients don't really care if their bunion was repaired with a laser, telescope, or a stethoscope. What patients want is the bunion gone with a nice cosmetic result and little downtime.What Is Bunion Laser Treatment?Lasers are excellent at treating a variety of cosmetic issues throughout the body. A laser is a powerful medical device that focuses light into a narrow beam, creating a high intensity light. It allows for ultra-precise targeted cutting. In the process, the heat of the laser coagulates tissue, and there is less bleeding -- a definite advantage over other conventional methods. Lasers, however, are best used for soft tissue and are known for their use in skin surgery and removal of soft tissue growths. The benefits in bunion surgery remain limited, however, because a bunion is a bone problem and not a skin problem.  Bunions Are Fixed, Not Removed.Most people incorrectly believe that a bunion is an overgrowth of tissue and bone, and this is why they incorrectly assume a laser can blitz their bunion. A bunion is actually a maligned big toe joint that results in the underlying bone being pushed outward from beneath the skin. The misconception that lasers are good for removal of bunions stems from patients incorrectly thinking that bunion surgery involves removal of a bunion. Rather, bunion surgery involves realignment of the deviated bones with special bone cuts or bone mending (Lapidus Bunionectomy) techniques. The Wall Street Journal featured an article on the various approaches to bunion surgery. A laser would actually be detrimental to bone cuts, as the heat of the laser would burn the bone, thus prevent proper healing. The benefit of lasers in bunion surgery are focused on the soft tissue aspects of the procedure, with the skin incision and the tissue augmentation. However, these benefits have not been proven to show any improved outcome in function or appearance with bunion surgery. What Are Patients Searching for Laser Bunion Removal Really Looking For?Most patients, in my experience, who are searching for laser bunion surgery just want a modern bunion surgery that results in a foot that looks good with little downtime. The most modern techniques in bunion surgery today do not call for lasers at all. Improved cosmetic result: Central to any bunion surgery is the proper realignment of the deviated bones. If this is properly performed, the appearance of the bunion will be gone. This is only a portion of the cosmetic outcome. Surgeons can perform plastic surgery techniques to limit scarring, which can be helpful. Some surgeons keep the incision off the top of the foot, which is popular for smaller bunions. The Bunionplasty(SM) procedure allows for all sizes of bunions to be treated with a hidden incision, which is made possible by specialized implants to hold the bone in the proper position. Quicker recovery: Modern techniques allow for patients to mobilize quicker than ever before. It takes six weeks for the bone to mend in a corrected position, and that can't be altered. What can be changed is how mobile patients are during this process. It used to be that small and moderate bunions were mobilized quickly and those with large bunions had to suffer in a cast and crutches. Nowadays, specialized bone fixating implants have allowed some to forgo the prolonged casting and crutches. In summary, if you are looking for the most modern techniques in bunion surgery, laser is not currently the best option. What is encouraging is that bunion surgery has changed dramatically in the past few years as surgeons are more focused on both the aesthetic and functional result.
