Anderson's defense team rested its case without calling any witnesses.Detectives said Anderson and McEnroe provided lengthy confessions, the Seattle Times said. Anderson was angry with her brother for refusing to pay back $40,000 she told investigators he borrowed from her.Trial testimony showed that she was angry at her parents for taking her brother’s side and for asking that she and McEnroe start paying rent, and for utilities and car insurance, after living rent-free in a mobile home on the parents' property, the newspaper said.Prosecutors could not be reached immediately for details.(Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

Access to healthcare is low in the South Pacific nation, while rates of domestic and sexual violence are alarming.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56dadbf51e0000c60070f547.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. This week, we speak with Doctors without Borders nurse Aoife Ní Mhurchú about sexual and family violence in Papua New Guinea.Papua New Guinea is one of the most dangerous countries in the world to be a woman.While the South Pacific nation does not have comprehensive statistics on sexual and domestic violence, the data that does exist is shocking.Globally, one in three women have experienced sexual or domestic violence. In Papua New Guinea, one study found two-thirds of women had been beaten by their partners. Another study found that in one region of the country, one in five women’s first sexual experience was rape.The international medical aid organization Doctors without Borders, or Medecins Sans Frontieres, released a report this week with disturbing new evidence of the scale of violence there. The report analyzes data from over 3,000 survivors of family and sexual violence treated in 2014 and the first half of 2015 in two MSF clinics -- in the capital, Port Moresby, and the rural town of Tari. Three in four sexual violence survivors knew the perpetrator. Over half of the survivors were children. One in six were under the age of 5. Two-thirds of the population in Papua New Guinea, one of the most linguistically and culturally diverse countries in the world, lives below the poverty line, and the country suffers from a shortage of medical staff and a weak justice system. While the economy has grown rapidly in recent years, weakening commodity prices have hurt the country.MSF urged Papua New Guinea and international donors to follow through on recent reforms intended to protect women and children. Aoife Ní Mhurchú has worked as a managing nurse at MSF’s project in Tari for the past eight months and wrote about her experiences in a blog that The WorldPost and MSF published this week. We spoke to her about the social and historical context for the extreme levels of violence against women and children in the country.How did Papua New Guinea become such an incredibly dangerous place for women and children?What I have seen is that gaps in treatment and services leave women and children with little choice but to return to their abusers.Obviously sexual and gender-based violence is not an exclusive problem to Papua New Guinea, but it is a really big problem here. The report shows we have some of the highest levels of sexual and family violence outside a conflict zone.As a nurse, I see several cases of family and sexual violence a day. I see women of all ages coming in, feeling afraid and nervous with nowhere to go.Have your interactions with patients given you insights into the factors behind this wide-scale violence?Culturally, it’s a patrilineal society, where women’s beliefs and values aren’t equal to men. The mentality here is that the men are in charge -- really, whatever the man asks, the woman has to submit. There is a cultural tradition whereby a man who wants to get married must pay a bride price -- usually a large sum of money and some livestock paid by the man and his tribe -- which causes people to think they have ownership over the woman, as well as the children.How much does the remoteness of a community like Tari, where you are working, make it harder for abused women and children to get help?We are very remote, so the services are very restricted here. It is inaccessible by road from other parts of the country. There’s just a little airstrip in the mountains. Although it’s the capital of the district, it really just comprises a few buildings around the airstrip -- the hospital, the police station, a bank and a few small stores. There’s a really big population here and it’s a really busy hospital, but when you fly in by plane you wonder where they come from. There’s literally just rainforest and bush as far as the eye can see. In fact, they come from all over, from small villages around the region. There are very few roads, so people might walk for days to reach us.The government has recognized in recent years that gender-based violence in the country is a public health and social emergency. What do you think led authorities recognize the scale of the problem?Awareness of sexual and gender-based violence has been increasing worldwide. And since MSF started responding to family and sexual violence in Papua New Guinea eight years ago, we’ve made important steps forward. When we started, the national capacity and expertise to provide assistance to survivors of family and sexual violence was very, very limited. There were very few services available and psychosocial support almost didn’t exist. We have worked with the Department of Health on guidelines on how to establish family support centers, and the model of care of five essential services that every survivor must receive, which will be adopted in the near future. We have outreach teams who raise awareness in the community, which increases people’s understanding that this violence has serious medical consequences. It also motivates survivors to come to us for treatment.The government has taken several policy steps in the right direction, but [these] efforts are only just emerging and already struggling. There are newly established family and sexual violence units at some police stations, but they don’t have the adequate number of trained personnel. In 2013, the country passed a family protection act that made family violence a punishable crime for the first time, but it’s not being enforced adequately. A child welfare act passed last year, mandating child protection officers to respond to child abuse and remove a child from the situation if they were at risk, but that is still waiting approval, and specialized trained officers and licensed safe houses. What are the main obstacles to implementing these reforms? I think it just hasn’t been prioritized. No matter what the cost is of implementing the reforms -- such as opening up safe houses and training staff -- the medical cost of abuse is very, very big. If the reforms were in place, it would relieve the medical cost. We’re hoping the report will push the government, and create pressure from donor countries, to escalate the response.What measures have your patients taken to try and protect themselves and their children from violence?It’s very hard to. I’ve treated so many patients ... who are coming in time and again for medical treatment, in between abuse sessions. These women come in to us when their injuries are severe, but there are many more times when they have minor injuries and they don’t come.We are reminded of the pervasiveness of violence here when even our female staff come into work too beaten up to perform their duties -- these are the very nurses and mental health counsellors and social workers who are helping us to treat the women and children.We do offer a safe space in our family support center, which is just a small sleeping area where women can spend one or two nights safely, but this is offered because there are no other safe houses in Tari. Often the only option for women is to go home to their own villages and family. Sometimes, in terrible circumstances, this is a measure that the women can take to protect themselves if their tribe is agreeable to paying back the bride price to allow for a divorce.I had one patient, a 26-year-old mother of two small children, who was five months pregnant with her third child. She had refused her abusive husband sex so he raped her and chopped her severely. Her fingers were amputated from her left and her right hands. She was severely chopped on both hands and both legs, and all of her four limbs were badly fractured. Our priority that day was to save her life. After 12 surgeries and months of hospitalization and counseling, she made a remarkable recovery. She miscarried, but we managed to save her hands and feet. Although she is disabled as a result of her injuries, she will be able to look after her two young children. Her injuries were so severe, and there was such a real fear for her life, that the elders of her tribe agreed that she could divorce and that they would pay back the bride price to enable this separation.However, this is often not possible. I had a patient last Friday, a 28-year-old mother who returned to her family’s village with her children to escape her abusive husband. But her father said he couldn’t afford to feed the three of them, or pay back the bride price. Out of anger at her for coming home, he chopped her hand really severely -- her fingers were amputated on one hand, and the whole of her other hand was severed. We operated on her hand, but it’s still too early to say whether we’ve saved it or not. That woman has nowhere else to go. The reality is that when she’s discharged, she will have to go back to her abusive husband, now with her terrible disabilities that have been inflicted upon her by her father.The community has started to set up a family and sexual violence action committee, which will represent the voices of Tari women to try and target and support women who are caught in this cycle of violence and abuse. We also have one female police officer here in Tari, who has been trained in family and sexual violence and we work closely with her. She is a wonderful asset, but she is not working 24/7, and the incidence of family and sexual violence is so high here that the need is constant.How have survivors of sexual and family-based violence whom you have treated reacted to reform efforts? What forms of protection, treatment and justice are they asking for?The women who come in are very aware of the culture of impunity here and the lack of protective services. They know that they can get very good treatment from MSF, but when they go home, they go back into the cycle of violence and they have absolutely no control over it.They’re asking for somewhere safe to go. They’re asking for police enforcement -- to enforce these laws that have already been passed. We’re treating the same patients again and again, with escalating injuries, in between abuse sessions. They really need these services here in Tari and countrywide as well.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

Millions of families in the United States are eligible for housing assistance, but there are far too few units available.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d9c5941e0000950070f4b4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Federal programs provide homes for about 5 million families nationwide, but that’s only a fraction of the people who are trying to receive assistance, according to a report released Thursday. For the report, researchers at Public and Affordable Housing Research Corporation looked at a study about homelessness among public housing applicants published in 2014 by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. PAHRC research manager Keely Stater zeroed in on a startling figure: In 2012, 2.76 million families were on waiting lists for housing choice vouchers, a federal program that covers a portion of recipients' rents in privately owned affordable housing. But close to half of local housing agencies, struggling with shrinking resources and a finite number of vouchers, had closed their waiting lists when the data was collected, meaning families that wanted to apply for affordable housing couldn’t. Stater wanted to determine how many families were actually trying to get assistance, whether waiting on an official list or off it. In their analysis of the HUD data, researchers used statistical models to estimate that 9.5 million households would be on waiting lists for housing vouchers if there were no caps -- more than three times the official total. Their estimates only include those they predict would apply if waiting lists were open; there are more eligible families who don't seek housing assistance and were not included.The revised, larger figure underscores the need for an expansion of affordable housing programs, Stater said. In some states, there are more than four families waiting for each available housing voucher. It's clear how far the programs fall short when you look at what happens when agencies reopen their closed waiting lists. When the Detroit Housing Commission -- which serves several Michigan counties -- opened its waiting list last year, 40,000 people applied. DHC added 7,000 applicants to the waiting list, chosen by lottery, leaving another 33,000 out of luck.Chicago opened its waiting lists in 2014 for the first time in over four years. More than 280,000 people registered and only 96,000 were added.Once a family makes it onto a list, there’s no guarantee that they’ll get assistance anytime soon. Waiting list size and turnover vary, but in some places, applicants who make it on the list end up stuck for years. In 2013, The New York Times talked to Maria Almonte, one of over 200,000 people on the New York City Housing Authority’s waiting list for public housing. She applied in 2009.“Every time I call, they don’t say anything,” Almonte told the paper. “They say, ‘You’re on the waiting list, you’re on the waiting list.' Sometimes I feel such anxiety because of the uncertainty.”New York City has one of the most robust sets of housing assistance programs, but also has some of the highest need. According to PAHRC’s estimates, there are more than five families seeking vouchers for each one available in New York County.Families who haven’t yet succeeded in getting housing assistance cope in a variety of ways, Stater said. Some spend more of their income on rent than they can afford, others might share space with other tenants or stay with relatives and some people are homeless.“There's a lot more people waiting than we previously thought. … It’s pretty astounding to me,” she said. “This is a great way to demonstrate that we need more resources for housing across the nation.”"

The officer was arrested two days later and then fired.McHenry was ordered Thursday to report to the Butler County Jail by March 12 and to pay the victim's court costs and fines, as well as pay fees to a state fund for crime victims.Though several media reports have said there was outrage following the lenient plea deal, McHenry's attorneys told the New York Daily News that both sides agreed to the deal after three hours of negotiations. “Both sides have to agree to it, so in that sense there was that discussion about is this acceptable to both sides,” said James Williamson, an attorney for McHenry.Civil litigation may be forthcoming, the Daily Beast reports.It's well documented that most sexual assaults go unreported, and according to the Justice Department, just two out of every 100 rapists see jail time.McHenry joins hundreds of officers nationwide who have lost their badges due to sexual misconduct over the past six years, according to an AP investigation. Reporters found about 1,000 such cases -- a number that likely understates the prevalence of such misconduct. States report officer misconduct differently, and not all remove officers from duty after such crimes come to light."
6,SCIENCE,Why Silence Is So Good For Your Brain,Carolyn Gregoire,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/silence-brain-benefits_us_56d83967e4b0000de4037004,"In a loud and distracting world, finding pockets of stillness can benefit your brain and body. Here are four science-backed reasons why.",2016-03-05,"Making time for silence can make you feel less stressed, more focused and more creative, according to science.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d8bfe11e0000950070f41a.jpeg?cache=L05JyHz4gr&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We live in a loud and distracting world, where silence is increasingly difficult to come by ― and that may be negatively affecting our health.In fact, a 2011 World Health Organization report called noise pollution a “modern plague,” concluding that “there is overwhelming evidence that exposure to environmental noise has adverse effects on the health of the population.”We’re constantly filling our ears with music, TV and radio news, podcasts and, of course, the multitude of sounds that we create nonstop in our own heads. Think about it: How many moments each day do you spend in total silence? The answer is probably very few.As our internal and external environments become louder and louder, more people are beginning to seek out silence, whether through a practice of sitting quietly for 10 minutes every morning or heading off to a 10-day silent retreat.Inspired to go find some peace and quiet? Here are four science-backed ways that silence is good for your brain ― and how making time for it can make you feel less stressed, more focused and more creative. 1. Silence relieves stress and tension. Florence Nightingale, the 19th century British nurse and social activist, once wrote that “Unnecessary noise is the most cruel absence of care that can be inflicted on sick or well.” Nightingale argued that needless sounds could cause distress, sleep loss and alarm for recovering patients.It turns out that noise pollution has been found to lead to high blood pressure and heart attacks, as well as impairing hearing and overall health. Loud noises raise stress levels by activating the brain’s amygdala and causing the release of the stress hormone cortisol, according to research.An unpublished 2004 paper by environmental psychologist Dr. Craig Zimring suggests that higher noise levels in neonatal intensive care units led to elevated blood pressure, increased heart rates and disrupted patient sleep patterns. Just as too much noise can cause stress and tension, research has found that silence has the opposite effect, releasing tension in the brain and body.A 2006 study published in the journal Heart found two minutes of silence to be more relaxing than listening to “relaxing” music, based on changes in blood pressure and blood circulation in the brain.2. Silence replenishes our mental resources.In our everyday lives, sensory input is being thrown at us from every angle. When we can finally get away from these sonic disruptions, our brains’ attention centers have the opportunity to restore themselves.The ceaseless attentional demands of modern life put a significant burden on the prefrontal cortex of the brain, which is involved in high-order thinking, decision-making and problem-solving.As a result, our attentional resources become drained. When those attention resources are depleted, we become distracted and mentally fatigued, and may struggle to focus, solve problems and come up with new ideas.But according to attention restoration theory, the brain can restore its finite cognitive resources when we’re in environments with lower levels of sensory input than usual. In silence ― for instance, the quiet stillness you find when walking alone in nature ― the brain can let down its sensory guard, so to speak.3. In silence, we can tap into the brain’s default mode network. The default mode network of the brain is activated when we engage in what scientists refer to as “self-generated cognition,” such as daydreaming, meditating, fantasizing about the future or just letting our minds wander.When the brain is idle and disengaged from external stimuli, we can finally tap into our inner stream of thoughts, emotions, memories and ideas. Engaging this network helps us to make meaning out of our experiences, empathize with others, be more creative and reflect on our own mental and emotional states.In order to do this, it’s necessary to break away from the distractions that keep us lingering on the shallow surfaces of the mind. Silence is one way of getting there.Default mode activity helps us think deeply and creatively. As Herman Melville once wrote, “All profound things and emotions of things are preceded and attended by silence.”4. Getting quiet can regenerate brain cells. Silence can quite literally grow the brain.A 2013 study on mice, published in the journal Brain, Structure, and Function, involved comparing the effects of ambient noise, white noise, pup calls and silence on the rodents’ brains. Although the researchers intended to use silence as a control in the study, they found that two hours of silence daily led to the development of new cells in the hippocampus, a key brain region associated with learning, memory and emotion. While preliminary, the findings suggested that silence could be therapeutic for conditions like depression and Alzheimer’s, which are associated with decreased rates of neuron regeneration in the hippocampus."

Do you feel under appreciated, unseen, and unsupported? If so, it may be that you need to learn how to set some boundaries in your life and relationships.So why exactly do you need boundaries in your relationships and life? Here are 5 reasons:#1 - They give you a sense of selfWhen we don't have boundaries in our lives it implies that we don't have a solid sense of self. We will tend to take on other people's thoughts, feelings, ideas, beliefs, and values rather than to have our own. This is commonly referred to as enmeshment.When we are enmeshed with another person it means that there is no distinct boundary between you and another person. There is very little sense as to where one person ends and the other begins. One or both people will then have difficulty identifying their own unique individual experience and how it differs from the other person.When this is present, it implies difficulty in differentiation from a parent in early childhood. This doesn't mean that it is ""good"" or ""bad"", as it is quite common for most people to have experienced it at least somewhat in their development.Being enmeshed can be very stressful, draining, and overwhelming. Relationships can easily get ""messy"" and a person can feel like they have no control over themselves or anything in their lives. As a result, a person's natural tendency would then be to try to control other people, which is codependent.Learning to recognize our own internal experience and then setting boundaries in a way that honors our internal experience, helps us solidify our sense of self with the external world. It also helps create less stress and more balance in our relationships.#2 - You are able to decide how you want to be treated by othersWhen we have boundaries we are able to effectively tell a bully that we will not tolerate their behavior. We are able to leave a relationship that isn't serving us in what we know is in our highest good. When we have boundaries, we are able to enter into relationships that do support us in our own personal growth and healing.  #3 - You are able to make life decisions that serve and support youWhen we have boundaries, we are able to say ""no"" to that job that is potentially wearing us out by working overtime for little pay. We are able to say ""yes"" to taking new career path without getting locked into feelings of guilt or ""what other people will think"".   #4 - You are able to make choices that are better for your health and well-beingBy having boundaries, we are also able to make better choices for our own health and well-being. We are able to say ""no"" to smoking that cigarette or having a glass of wine and, instead, say ""yes"" to having some green juice and going to the gym. We are more aware that we're going to feel shitty after eating that brownie, so we're able to turn away and eat something healthier.#5 - You feel empoweredWhen set boundaries in our lives, we feel more connected with ourselves and more in control of our lives. We are able to live for ourselves, rather than through this desire to please other people. We are able to be in relationships that are healthy, balanced, and equal.

The researchers wanted to know why some people are more successful than others at work, and the answers were surprising; leaders chose ""personality"" as the leading reason.Notably, 78% of leaders said personality sets great employees apart, more than cultural fit (53%) and even an employee's skills (39%).""We should take care not to make the intellect our God; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality."" - Albert Einstein The problem is, when leaders say 'personality' they don't understand what they're referring to. Personality consists of a stable set of preferences and tendencies through which we approach the world. Being introverted or extroverted is an example of an important personality trait.Personality traits form at an early age and are fixed by early adulthood. Many important things about you change over the course of your lifetime, but your personality isn't one of them.Personality is distinct from intellect (or IQ). The two don't occur together in any meaningful way. Personality is also distinct from emotional intelligence (or EQ), and this is where the study, and most leaders for that matter, have misinterpreted the term.The qualities that leaders in the study called personality were actually emotional intelligence skills. And unlike your personality, which is set in stone, you can change and improve your EQ.Exceptional employees don't possess God-given personality traits; they rely on simple, everyday EQ skills that anyone can incorporate into their repertoire.Leaders don't need to go searching for these skills either (though it doesn't hurt when you find them); their duty is to help everyone on their team harness these skills to become exceptional.Just consider some of the EQ skills that leaders and managers commonly mislabel as personality characteristics. These are the skills that set exceptional employees apart.They're willing to delay gratification. One thing an exceptional employee never says is, ""That's not in my job description."" Exceptional employees work outside the boundaries of job descriptions. They're neither intimidated nor entitled; instead of expecting recognition or compensation to come first, they forge ahead in their work, confident that they'll be rewarded later but unconcerned if they're not.They can tolerate conflict. While exceptional employees don't seek conflict, they don't run away from it either. They're able to maintain their composure while presenting their positions calmly and logically. They're able to withstand personal attacks in pursuit of the greater goal and never use that tactic themselves.They focus. Student pilots are often told, ""When things start going wrong, don't forget to fly the plane."" Plane crashes have resulted from pilots concentrating so hard on identifying the problem that they flew the plane into the ground. Eastern Airlines Flight 401 is just one example: The flight crew was so concerned about the landing gear being down that they didn't realize they were losing altitude until it was too late, despite alarms going off in the cockpit. Exceptional employees understand the principle of ""Just fly the plane."" They don't get distracted by cranky customers, interoffice squabbles, or switch to a different brand of coffee. They can differentiate between real problems and background noise; therefore, they stay focused on what matters.They're judiciously courageous. Exceptional employees are willing to speak up when others are not, whether it's to ask a difficult (or ""embarrassingly"" simple) question or to challenge an executive decision. However, that's balanced with common sense and timing. They think before they speak and wisely choose the best time and place to do so.They're in control of their egos. Exceptional employees have egos. While that's part of what drives them, they never give their egos more weight than what is deserved. They're willing to admit when they're wrong and willing to do things someone else's way, whether it's because the other way is better or it's important to maintain team harmony.  They're never satisfied. Exceptional employees have unparalleled convictions that things can always be better--and they're right. No one is ever done growing, and there is no such thing as ""good enough"" when it comes to personal improvement. No matter how well things are going, exceptional employees are driven to improve, without forgetting to give themselves a healthy pat on the back.They recognize when things are broken and fix them. Whether it's a sticky desk drawer or an inefficient, wasteful process affecting the cash flow of the entire department, exceptional employees don't walk past problems. ""Oh, it's been that way forever,"" simply isn't in their vocabulary. They see problems as issues to be fixed immediately; it's that simple.They're accountable. If you're a manager trying to decipher a bungled report, ""It's not my fault"" is the most irritating phrase in the English language. Exceptional employees are accountable. They own their work, their decisions, and all of their results--good or bad. They bring their mistakes to management's attention rather than hoping no one will find out. They understand that managers aren't out to assign blame; they're out to get things done.They're marketable. ""Marketable"" can mean many things. Inside the organization, it means ""likeable."" Exceptional employees are well liked by co-workers. They have integrity and leadership skills (even if they're not in an official leadership position) that people respond to. Externally, it means they can be trusted to represent the brand well. Managers know they can send these employees out to meet with clients and prospects without worrying about what they'll say or do.They neutralize toxic people. Dealing with difficult people is frustrating and exhausting for most. Exceptional employees control their interactions with toxic people by keeping their feelings in check. When they need to confront a toxic person, they approach the situation rationally. They identify their own emotions and don't allow anger or frustration to fuel the chaos. They also consider the difficult person's standpoint and are able to find solutions and common ground. Even when things completely derail, emotionally intelligent people are able to take the toxic person with a grain of salt to avoid letting him or her bring them down.Bringing It All TogetherTake notice of what's not mentioned: coding skills, years of experience, business degrees, etc. These things matter, but they won't make you exceptional.What other qualities make people exceptional?

""Oh, it's been that way forever,"" simply isn't in their vocabulary. They see problems as issues to be fixed immediately; it's that simple.They're accountable. If you're a manager trying to decipher a bungled report, ""It's not my fault"" is the most irritating phrase in the English language. Exceptional employees are accountable. They own their work, their decisions, and all of their results--good or bad. They bring their mistakes to management's attention rather than hoping no one will find out. They understand that managers aren't out to assign blame; they're out to get things done.They're marketable. ""Marketable"" can mean many things. Inside the organization, it means ""likeable."" Exceptional employees are well liked by co-workers. They have integrity and leadership skills (even if they're not in an official leadership position) that people respond to. Externally, it means they can be trusted to represent the brand well. Managers know they can send these employees out to meet with clients and prospects without worrying about what they'll say or do.They neutralize toxic people. Dealing with difficult people is frustrating and exhausting for most. Exceptional employees control their interactions with toxic people by keeping their feelings in check. When they need to confront a toxic person, they approach the situation rationally. They identify their own emotions and don't allow anger or frustration to fuel the chaos. They also consider the difficult person's standpoint and are able to find solutions and common ground. Even when things completely derail, emotionally intelligent people are able to take the toxic person with a grain of salt to avoid letting him or her bring them down.Bringing It All TogetherTake notice of what's not mentioned: coding skills, years of experience, business degrees, etc. These things matter, but they won't make you exceptional.What other qualities make people exceptional? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."
13,POLITICS,Grumpy Old Men: Why Trump and Sanders Resonate with Voters,"Matthew Ogbeifun, ContributorStudent and Editor-at-large, University of Minnesota-Twin Cities",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/grumpy-old-men-why-trump-_b_9189912.html,"It's not a stretch to say the landscape of American politics has changed, with a direct correlation to the current state of affairs in America. In a post-industrial capitalist society, Americans of all creed and color are experiencing an overall decline in quality of life.",2016-03-05,2016-03-01-1456856603-2025019-trumppresidentialannouncement2015.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-03-01-1456856603-2025019-trumppresidentialannouncement2015-thumb.jpg," Christopher Gregory, Getty ImagesOn a phone interview with CNN on July 28th, Donald Trump expressed his criticism of establishment elite:""This is more than me; this is a movement going on. People are tired of these incompetent politicians in Washington that can't get anything done,"" said Trump. ""They can't make deals; they can't do anything. They go and they - all they care about is getting elected.""It's not a stretch to say the landscape of American politics has changed, with a direct correlation to the current state of affairs in America. In a post-industrial capitalist society, Americans of all creed and color are experiencing an overall decline in quality of life.On opposite ends of the political spectrum, both Sen. Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump promise change. While their vision of change differs in the most extreme way possible, the part of the American psyche they appeal to is exactly the same.To understand this, we have to add context. The middle class is losing more of its wealth as the upper class, fueled by capital gains, continues to swallow up more influence and wealth, further dividing the classes from one another.The rift amongst occupation and income in America, even amongst those who obtain a college degree, is widening at an alarming rate. The higher education system has become more economically polarized. Although the higher-education system encourages upward mobility and economic opportunity, the ability to capitalize on those opportunities are fairly slim for individuals from lower-income backgrounds. Additionally, views on race relations, state violence and discrimination are more divisive, as seen in a CBS/New York Times poll.The American Dream of equal opportunity, independence, and upward mobility seems a distant memory. As a result, many Americans are beginning to place the blame on ineffective political structures and turn to new ideology in hopes to help fix the system that often works against them.At the same time, Trump mania is sweeping across the nation and stirring the pot of the once relatively stagnant U.S. political scene. Given Donald Trump's financial independence, immense name recognition, perceived authenticity, and successful business acumen, he has amassed a large constituency and constructed a highly effective upheaval of conventional political campaigning.Then there's Bernie Sanders, whose ""democratic socialist"" positioning -- along with his short disheveled hair, hunched shoulders and agitating style -- naturally renders him a political outcast in Washington. Matthew Ogbeifun, NOC Presidential Forum on Black America, MinneapolisThis raises a couple of concerned eyebrows and two very important questions: Why do Trump and Sanders resonate with voters? What does their presence in the American political scene expose about the current state of American society at-large?Over the past few decades a series of profound changes have taken place. Increased socioeconomic disparities and changing demographics fueled by increased racial and ethnic diversity has led to a massive cultural and societal divide. As a result, an increase in starkly differing opinions on American socio-political issues and voter polarity have followed suit.According to a Washington Post article in 2014, Democratic and Republican voters today are far more divided by race religious beliefs, ideological orientations and policy preferences than in the past. These trends manifest themselves in various ways, leading to increased gridlock in Washington and in the everyday life of many Americans.In 2014, the Pew Research Center conducted a yearlong political survey on political polarization. According to their findings trends in political polarization first start as far back as 1994, and have grown exponentially ever since, as the figure below shows.The graphic below shows the extent to which members of both parties have become more ideologically consistent, and therefore, trend further away from one another. As a result, today 92% of Republicans are to the rights of the median Democrat, and 94% of Democrats are to the left of the median Republican.Partisan animosity has also increased substantially over the same period. In both parties, the proportions of those who share a highly negative view of the opposing party has more than doubled since 1994. Most of these intense partisans believe the opposing party's policies ""are so misguided that they threaten the nation's well-being."" As seen in the figure below.What is the cause of this massive cultural shift? People are angry. In recent times, this populist anger initiated by the 2008 economic recession lit a fire under American liberals and conservatives, alike. Propelling the Tea Party in 2010 and Occupy Wall Street in 2011.Over the years, excessive partisanship and massive ideological divisions have led to a disconnect between the voter base and party elite. The void is immense. As a result, this left many voters across party lines feeling as though their voice isn't being heard. This chaotic state, particularly within the GOP, serves as the perfect breeding ground for radical ideology. In response to the turbulence within American society --the fear-mongering, xenophobic machine that is Donald Trump-- has cunningly played well to the base, and positioned himself as the voice of the people.Bernie Sanders was also known as a forthright antagonist while he served in the House. In 1990, Sanders called Congress ""impotent"", and scorned the two major parties as inseparable instruments of the rich. In 2003, he grilled former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, for being ""out of touch"" with the needs of the middle class and working families.Other interesting parallels between both candidates can be seen in their rise into prominence. At first, both were seen as underdogs, with willingness to sacrifice ideological purity to 'tell it how it is.' Neither campaign has received donations from Super PACs or special interest groups. And both have an ability to bring new voters into the political process, mostly through support from a new wave of Americans who resent the current economic climate.Oddly enough, the majority of their constituents are also fairly similar in many ways.According to a recent Gallup poll, most Democrats and Republicans voters agree on the top four issues in the campaign: the economy, national security, jobs, and healthcare. Where they differ lies in Republicans placing more priority in the federal budget deficit, foreign affairs, the size and efficiency of the federal government, immigration, and taxes, as opposed to Democrats placing more urgency on issues relating to the income/wealth distribution, the environment, and education.Where Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders are most effective lies in their uncanny ability to speak on behalf of the widespread outrage and frustrations felt by Americans, while simultaneously constituting an element of antiestablishment appeal. All of which serve to aid in their highly effective upheaval of conventional political campaigning. Both seemingly serve to expose fallacies, contradictions, and hypocrisy within American politics, as citizens are beginning to correlate the near-universal decrease in quality of life in America to the ineffective policies leaders enact.This is true in almost every state where pollsters are speaking to Republican constituents. Trump leads with 38 percent support in New Jersey, 34 percent in South Carolina, 42 percent in Florida, 30 percent in heavily-polled New Hampshire, 31 percent in Ohio, 22 percent in Pennsylvania, 36 percent in Texas, and 25 percent in California.And while the vast majority of Donald Trump's supporters reside within the GOP camp, even those who traditionally vote Democratic find themselves able to slightly agree to a portion of his strikingly skewed views. Sanders also appeals to an antiestablishment strain that isn't particularly Liberal. Some Republicans believe that Sanders embodies conservative values. In Vermont, Republicans on the Burlington City Council sided with Sanders on Fiscal issues. His promise to redistribute power from Wall Street to mainstream America is a message that resonates with most Republicans. According to a New York Times/CBS poll conducted in May, 51% percent of Republicans think large corporations have too much influence on American life and politics today. In addition, back in his home state of Vermont many of the low-income parts are Republican, largely populated by Libertarians who generally share a skepticism of government intrusion into individual judgement.In an article featured in The Atlantic, Author Clare Foran interviews Political Science Professor Chris Ellis, who offers an interesting take on partisanship: ""Once you get out of Washington 'conservative' can mean all sorts of different things. Voters are often left of center on some issues and right of center on others. So someone like Trump or Sanders who talks about themselves in a way that doesn't fit into a pre-ordained box could be appealing to a lot of people,"" says Chris Ellis, a political science professor at Bucknell University. (Foran, The Atlantic)So, is there still hope for the future? Will Donald Trump 'Make America Great Again?' or will Bernie Sanders bring us ""A Future to Believe in?' Despite all the hoopla surrounding both candidates, I'm still malcontent. Do either represent a true socio-political paradigm shift? or do they only serve to speak on frustrations? In my opinion, neither candidate is a true depiction of the radical disruption and renovation of the political process that many Americans eagerly seek. Old, angry, white men fighting for control of the country is akin to the traditional American power dynamic.In an interview with NPR News on December 21st, President Barack Obama posed a question for his successor:""I might just ask somebody, 'Why do you want to do this?' ""he said. ""And I suppose they would give a cliché answer because that's what candidates do, but I will tell you as president, if you are interested just because you like the title or you like the trappings or you like the power or the fame or the celebrity, that side of it wears off pretty quick. At least it has for me."""

In fact, candidates have called him a traitor, a spy, and stated that he's committed treason. The facts are Snowden broke the law, but in turn, exposed illegal government activity to the American people. So did Snowden actually do something illegal or commit treason? That's where the 'which came first, the chicken or egg' argument comes into play, but it seems as if all of the presidential candidates have stated the chicken clearly committed treason.Maybe I'm not surprised that none of the candidates have spoken in favor of Snowden, but I just thought that if there was someone who would stand up for him, it would be Bernie Sanders. When asked about the issue, Sanders has stated ""I think Snowden played a very important role in educating the American public ... he did break the law, and I think there should be a penalty to that."" But Sanders also has stated that he would shut down the NSA and was one of the very few who voted against the Patriot Act. And just recently, Sanders tweeted out: 'In my view, the NSA is out of control and operating in an unconstitutional manner.'It just doesn't make sense to me. Sanders supports the outcome of what Snowden brought to light, but doesn't agree with the methods of how the information was made public. Maybe if Sanders supported Snowden, it would hurt him in the election, so maybe this isn't a huge issue for him right now. Maybe his campaign views Snowden as a can of worms, as he is only one person. But Sanders doesn't have a history of sitting down when issues are not politically expedient. In fact, Bernie Sanders' stance on Snowden is with the majority of Americans who would prosecute Snowden, according to recent polls. And Sanders is already better than most candidates when it comes to the issue of government surveillance, the NSA, and privacy.However, if Sanders continues on his path of standing up for ideas when it's in the infancy of popular opinion, he would come out in support of Snowden. There aren't many issues on which I disagree with Bernie Sanders, but to use his own words, his stance on Snowden is just not good enough."

He is the ascendant Obama coalition; let's make sure he ascends right now.,2016-03-05,"FILE - In this Feb. 19, 2013 file photo, Cincinnati City Councilman P.G. Sittenfeld, front, speaks during a news conference in Cincinnati. On Wednesday, Jan. 13, 2016, Sittenfeld, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, questioned whether former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, his primary opponent who has a top rating from the National Rifle Association, really tempered his position on gun control after the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre. (AP Photo/Al Behrman, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb9352f1f00003d02259002.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This is quite an election year. Trump, Cruz, Scalia, Bernie, Jeb, Hillary and way too many discussions about Republican penises. It's like we have a whole new verse to ""We Didn't Start the Fire."" So it's easy to lose site of all the important non-presidential races taking place right now. So, let's talk about one of them.In Ohio, probably the most important swing state in the country, there is also a race going on for the U.S. Senate, one of maybe four or five that will determine who controls the upper chamber of Congress. The Republican, Rob Portman, is exactly the Jeb-like stooge you'd expect. He's George W. Bush's former trade negotiator and budget guy, someone who thinks defunding Planned Parenthood, opposing a minimum wage increase, blocking universal background checks on guns and refusing to do his job as laid out in the Constitution, to put a new justice on the Supreme Court. But the real race here right now is in the state's Democratic Primary. While I'd rather not attack a Democrat, there is just too much of a difference between the young, urban-based, future-looking campaign of P.G. Sittenfeld, and the Blue Dog-ish, uninspiring, ghost-like campaign of the one-term former governor of Ohio, Ted Strickland. The former can beat Rob Portman, the latter simply has no chance, and will lose like he did his reelection campaign in 2010.P.G. is a progressive's progressive in the mold of former senators John Glenn and the late Howard Metzenbaum, as well as current U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown. He's for scrapping the cap on Social Security. He supports universal background checks on guns, as well as forward thinking measures like microstamping of ammunition. He's for paid family leave, a $15 minimum wage and bold measures to do all we can to ameliorate the climate crisis. He's also fully, proudly and loudly pro-choice.The DSCC endorsed Ted Strickland attacked Rob Portman rightfully for disrespecting Article II by refusing to support a new Supreme Court Justice, while refusing to debate his primary opponent. This is not a D-rated NRA supporter, like Bernie Sanders, but an A-plus rated NRA booster, who voted against every single gun-safety measure ever placed before him. He thought guns in bars were a good idea. And Stand Your Ground. And immunity for gun companies. Strickland fought against paid sick leave; wouldn't raise taxes on the wealthy as governor because he said it would hurt the economy (so he cut mental health funding and library funding instead); he voted to get rid of Glass-Steagall, and got a 30 percent rating from NARAL at one point in Congress (which is considered anti-choice); and recently said he'd support a Supreme Court Justice who is anti-choice. Before having his spokesperson walk it back. He wanted a ""pause"" in Syrian refugees, opposes a $15 minimum wage and was a friend of coal as governor, who when asked about Keystone refused to take a position because it was ""controversial.""Is this what Democrats think counts as leadership? Do Ohio progressives think this kind of cautious, hide-and-go-seek approach to important issues is what will inspire people? There are also the matters of he fact that Strickland is not someone who can sit in this seat for numerous terms, as someone who would be 75 years old when sworn in. And the fact that while P.G. is vivacious and charismatic, Strickland is halting and awkward. This might be why the only two-term Democratic governor in the past 50 years in Ohio, Dick Celeste, has endorsed P.G. It honestly couldn't be clear who will be a better Senator, and he has a chance of getting there, unlike his opponent. More of the same isn't selling this election season.This is too important a national race to let slide by without getting engage. Progressives should support P.G. Ohio Democrats must vote for him. We should all contribute what we can. He is the ascendant Obama coalition; let's make sure he ascends right now.Best yet, P.G.

Trump that on Thursday they sent out its feckless failed nominee Mitt Romney (who four years previous fulsomely praised Trump on jobs and trade) to verbally assassinate the party's own frontrunner. Even more dramatic, should Florida Senator Marco Rubio lose Florida's winner-take-all primary come March 15, some of these insiders are actually urging a vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton. This is welcome relief to Mrs. Clinton, who is keenly aware of the ""yuge"" numbers of new, often Democrat, voters turning out for Mr. Trump. She is also aware of the lower turnout numbers she and fellow ""Democrat"" Bernie Sanders - who prepared the ground for Clinton's far-left populist turn - are garnering this primary season. Senator Clinton, however, should also be cognizant of one disturbingly persistent electoral fact. Even if a fair number of traditional GOP conservatives abandon Mr. Trump - mainly on the basis of the billionaire's mercurial temperament, intemperate rhetoric, and glaring ignorance of policy details - in favor of her or a third party or write-in alternative, this may not be enough to deny Trump a general election triumph. Savvy Democratic insiders are thus worried that Mrs. Clinton will not only fail to win Obama's ""third term,"" but, should Trump protectionist fever sweep up Democratic working class voters in the paper mill towns of northern Wisconsin, Minnesota's Iron Range, and in the rest of the NAFTA-hating Upper Midwest, she could become road kill in a GOP electoral landslide ala Nixon over McGovern in 1972 and Reagan over Mondale in 1984. It is no wonder that Bernie Sanders polls far better than Clinton against not only Trump, but against all potential GOP nominees: the Socialist Vermont Senator also opposed the global free trade deals that hurt Rust Belt workers the most. To that end, Mr. Trump has achieved what the GOP has agonized about achieving for decades: a bigger and broader tent of voters that cuts across lines of race, ethnicity, geographic, party, age, sex, and, yes, education level and income. He reminded the party of just that fact in his victory speech at Mar-A-Lago Tuesday night and again in a tweet on Thursday @realDonaldTrump: ""Because of me, the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters, a record. If they are not careful, they will all leave. Sad!""Should the GOP Establishment orchestrate a coup against Trump either by successfully ganging up on him now and/or by jerry-rigging an un-democratic result at the July convention in Cleveland, they would lose those new Trump voters for decades. This inescapable fact does not seem to bother Establishment types, so deep is their venom towards the prohibitive front-runner. They don't care about the broad Trump coalition. They see the uncontrollable Trump as a gauche, ""insane"" traitor to the ""bi-partisan"" Ruling Class, a megalomaniacal Kurtz out there in the political hinterlands, commiserating with the serfs, Know-Nothings and untouchables who should be taking orders from central oligarchy command. Moreover, they are frustrated that Trump can't be bought. Outside of a small percentage of small donors (the spirit of which comic John Oliver incisively questioned), Trump is ""self-funding"" his campaign. They also don't like that Trump is a political outsider, who takes devilish delight in prodding, poking and disgracing the Establishment for its grotesque failures on trade, wages, Iraq, ISIS, and at the border, where it cynically opposes real solutions, lest it alienate its Chamber of Commerce donors, who feed at the low-wage, easily manipulated illegal immigrant trough. They especially don't like the Libertarian streak in Trump, who initially equivocated on whether he would give priority to Israel in Mideast negotiations (rabidly pro-Israel billionaires like Sheldon Adelson are huge GOP donors who can single-handedly control any candidate of their choosing), and who openly opposes the regime-change wars of recent Establishment vintage. Finally, they are outraged by the way that Trump has grown the GOP electorate. He has certainly not followed the playbook that GOP elites outlined in their 2012 electoral post-mortem, entitled Growth and Opportunity Project, which called for candidates to take moderate positions on illegal immigration to attract Latino conservatives. Instead, Trump has grown the tent in his indubitable shock jock, reality star way, with politically incorrect, if at times hilarious, chutzpah that's captivated a new crop of GOP under-40 voters raised on the politically incorrect charms of South Park and Family Guy, and the faux barbarities of WWE's ""Ravishing"" Rick Rude, Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, Howard Stern and The Jerry Springer Show. These voters implicitly get Trump's crude ad hominems, deliberate provocations, and signature, if at times ironic, braggadocio. However, what most galls the Establishment's obsequious toadies, Machiavellian careerists, and patronizing gatekeepers - not to mention its corporate media suck-ups who would sell their first-born for a slot on Meet the Press or mention in the Politico Playbook - is that, in expanding the tent, Trump has drawn out of the shadows the far-right fringe of the party that the GOP Establishment would like to keep hidden like some crazy dirt-eating Uncle. This John Birch, citizen militia, and, yes, KKK element of the GOP, is, in electoral terms, tiny. However, the rural and suburban nativists and college-educated nationalists on the outer circles of this core are more numerous than the mainstream GOP wants to publicly acknowledge. No precise figures can be put on its size. However, it's possible that with the support of this suddenly activated populist wing, combined with Trump's enduring appeal to moderate Tea Party members, evangelicals, ""country club Republicans,"" Libertarians, frat boys, and working class union members, that Trump could accrue an unheard of 63% of the overall white vote come November (Romney got 59% in 2012). As confirmed by U.S. News, this would be more than enough to give Trump the election - based on critical blue collar, Caucasian-strong swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina and New Hampshire - even if the Democratic nominee picks up all the other states that Obama won in 2012. This would occur even if the Democratic nominee manages to capture an unprecedented 85% of the Latino vote (which seems likely, given Mr. Trump's loosely conceived comments about illegal immigrants), 90% of the Muslim vote (which seems likely given Mr. Trump's call for a temporary Muslim immigration ban), over 75% of the Asian vote (beating Obama's 2012 numbers), and at least 85% of the black vote (which seems likely, given Mrs. Clinton's popularity with African-Americans, and an expected Obama speaking tour on Clinton's behalf come Fall). U.S. News concluded that even if Mitt Romney won a whopping 70% of the Hispanic vote in 2012, he still would not have won the election because Hispanics represented only 7% of voters. With non-Hispanic whites at 62.6% of the U.S. adult population, their votes ""Trump"" every other racial or ethnic group in the country. Those are sobering facts to contemplate for an Establishment GOP that has repeatedly proffered the lie that courting Latino voters is the best path to general election victory. Moreover, these numbers don't even consider that Trump could lose a few industrial states and still win the Presidency because of his across-the-board support in his home state of New York, which he has suddenly put into general election play.The Roper Center concludes that 5-10 million potential white GOP voters stayed home in 2012 because they didn't feel that Outsourcer-in-Chief Mitt Romney represented their economic interests. U.S. News notes that if white voters had merely voted at the same rate they did in 2004, Romney would have won in 2012, even with the minority demographic headwinds against him. Faced with this distinctly possible electoral result, the GOP Establishment has now collectively agreed that Lindsey Graham's strategy of ""Anybody but Trump"" must be their unflinching rallying cry (hashtag #NeverTrump). As I noted in my previous column, ""Comparing Trump to Hitler is Worst Kind of Hate Speech,""the Establishment has framed its anti-Trump movement in dangerously apocalyptic terms, and have thereby borrowed straight from the liberal racialist playbook. Never mind that President Obama failed to call out the anti-Semitic remarks of his own pastor (Reverend Jeremiah ""Goddamn America"" Wright) or the anti-gay remarks of many of the black pastors and professional black athletes that vociferously backed him, or that Hillary Clinton herself used race as a wedge issue in winning blue-collar working class white voters versus Obama in 2008, Trump is being held to a higher standard. Not because the GOP Establishment cares so much about people of color and the racial profiling that still occurs in many parts of America, but because their raison d'etre - for every global conflict there must be a U.S. military solution - is under threat. If deploying the race card allows them to destroy their neo-isolationist front-runner, they are ready to lose a general election, but live to fight another day on their neoconservative terms. The litmus test of their desperate, last-ditch, divide-and-conquer strategy has now arrived with the run-up to the March 15 Florida primary. During the next ten days, the GOP Establishment will unload the mother of all attack ad blitzes on the GOP frontrunner. Expect to hear even more distorted or outright fallacious stories about Trump's hiring of illegal aliens over three decades go (which Trump has explained ad nauseam), the ill-fated Trump University (which, as a former Forbes education columnist, I can assure you is a bit more shaky terrain for the billionaire), and his ostensible failure to give full-throttle disavowals of the egregious David Duke (whom I once interviewed for Playboy) and the KKK, even though Trump has done so (however dispassionately) on several occasions, including at Thursday night's Fox News Debate in Detroit. It is not enough, however, that the Establishment merely destroys or severely damages Mr. Trump. They need a Trump alternative. And that's where the GOP Establishment rubber has so far hit a rocky voter road. The anti-Trump voter is not particularly sold on any one of the Establishment or quasi-Establishment alternatives. For instance, there is previous Establishment bogeyman, the nauseatingly pious and obstreperous Texas Senator Ted Cruz, about whom darkly hilarious South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham said, ""If you killed Ted Cruz on the floor of the Senate, and the trial was in the Senate, nobody would convict you."" Though Cruz is precisely the win-at-all-costs nihilist debater type I excoriate in my documentary Master Debaters, and as Dr. Ben Carson can confirm, he is also the perfect Establishment candidate because backing him would show that the GOP is at least partially listening to its fed-up base. The redemption narrative would be clear. Cruz is the prodigal son, another hyphenate American, and part Canadian to boot, passionately proclaiming his freedom from Establishment influence, though happy to take their money (including secret loans from Goldman Sachs). Ted Cruz will be gradually bought back into the Establishment fold, with feigned public resistance, but little private compunction. Unfortunately, Ted Cruz has won only four states. And should he lose this weekend in Louisiana and Mississippi, as seems likely, his ""Southern firewall"" is toast. By contrast, there's Marco Rubio, an even more pathetically transparent Establishment lapdog. Another hyphenate American who rose from humble immigrant beginnings, he is, thus, desperately eager for the Establishment's blessings of money, power and prestige. A robotic, kneejerk supporter of Israel, and a strong believer in the neocon model of regime change, Rubio will without question lead us into another Mideast quagmire, which benefits the Establishment's military-industrial complex, if not the sons and daughters of America's working class who must give up their lives for these futile and costly misadventures. Unfortunately, though a perfectly malleable Establishment ""mark,"" the boyish Florida Senator has won just one state, Minnesota, and barely at that. And forget Grandpa John Kasich, who's stayed in the race to win the VP slot, but who will drop out if he loses his home state of Ohio to Trump, which still seems likely even after Cranky John's above-average debate performance in Detroit. So, none of the top establishment picks seem poised to overtake Trump (who has won 11 states and is poised to grab many more), even with this massive show of Establishment force. This is because the Trump voter, knowing that Trump represents their last chance to genuinely protect the border, deport illegal immigrant felons, and bring back manufacturing jobs to the hollowed out Industrial heartland, has dug in. They see any attempt to take down Trump as the Establishment ploy that it clearly is. This is not Pat Buchanan's Pitchfork Army, which backed down at the first sight of massive Establishment resistance. The Trump voters are not bending. And they are not breaking, no matter how many outre male anatomy jokes their candidate makes. They feel so forgotten by the pandering, diversity-obsessed status quo that they are willing to elect a touchy, narcissistic, policy lightweight as their next Commander-in-Chief.As Trump himself has admitted, he could murder someone on 5th Avenue and not lose the votes of his hard-core backers, who have pinned on him the same level of hope that Mr. Obama's fanatical base pinned on him. So, constant reminders of Trump's imprudent rhetoric are likely to fall on deaf ears. In addition, most of Senator Cruz's voters list Trump as their second choice. So, they too are likely to rally around the frontrunner, should Cruz drop out of the race, as is likely to be the case, after Trump's March 15 winner-take-all wins in Florida, Illinois, Missouri, and Ohio and subsequent winner-take-all victories in Arizona and Trump's home state of New York. Moreover, Rubio is currently 20 points behind in Florida. Bolstered by his come-from-behind performance in Virginia, where he was also 20 points back and battled Trump to a near tie, Rubio thinks he can pull off the upset. If the Senator somehow manages this miraculous comeback (late-breaking voters tend to swing his way), then, yes, game on for the Stop Trump movement. However, should Rubio fail, with the millions the Establishment will be pouring into the Sunshine State on his behalf, the prospect the Establishment most fears becomes likely reality: Donald Trump as the GOP nominee. You can rest assured that the Beltway power brokers - in tacit collaboration with mainstream media - will move heaven and earth to make sure that never happens. And right up in their smug and condescending faces will be the noisy, passionate fury of America's dispossed, a formerly ""silent majority"" who, like Howard Beale's followers in Network, are now ""mad as hell"" and sick and tired of seeing their dead and wounded sons and daughters as pawns in the Establishment's deadly imperial dreams and greedy border schemes.James Marshall Crotty is the peripatetic publisher of Monk: The Mobile Magazine, author of How to Talk American (Houghton Mifflin), and director of the urban debate documentary Crotty's Kids.

What astounds me is not that Trump has ""taken over"" the party but that so few recognized that Trumpism was the Republican Party for decades, and he has not taken it over but given voice to its private thoughts and voting record. Politics is a puzzle and the pieces do connect and present a coherent picture.Romney's Republicanism had no room for the disenfranchised, supported tax breaks for the rich, treated women as children who had best be told what is good or bad for them - abortion being the primary bad - raising a child alone without support or day care from the government the good - failing to spend public money to retrain those who lost their jobs to cheaper salaries in Asia, failing to spend money on roads, bridges, and while screaming for oil pipe lines refused to pay for water pipelines - so that we end with the horror of polluted drinking water that has damaged the children in Flint, Michigan. Racism? Who has long been against voting rights laws, school integration, rising minimum wages? Torture? A GOP euphemism for a strong military. Homophobia? Okay as long as it is confined to discriminating hiring practices and private remarks and avoids beating up gay men and women in the streets. They don't want to add to the high cost of street cleaning. Immigration? Welcome Andrew and Sven to the USA. No way for you Jose.Oh, how they shed tears over the murder of the babies in Sandy Hook yet refused to permit saner gun laws to pass in congress. Trump is merely the naked, and embarrassing expression of what the party has stood for in recent times - it is like your small child saying some naughty, racist, or obscene remark that he/she could only have heard at home and now expressed it in polite company. The birth-ism that came with the election of Obama, the refusal to let him name a Supreme Court Justice - this is but another expression of GOP racist politics as usual - nothing new here. The only thing new that Trump brings to GOP politics is a European trophy wife - and the desire to speak his dirty little mind - filled with views that he shares with so many of the ""respectable"" members of his party. If the Republican party breaks in half due to Trump's candidacy it won't be over principles but due to public embarrassment. If we are seeing pink elephants lately it is not because we have had too much to drink but because the GOP symbol is blushing with shame for being seen for what it has been for generations."
18,POLITICS,5 Ways We Can Make 2016 Better for Women and Girls,"Esther Wojcicki, ContributorJournalism/English teacher",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/5-ways-we-can-make-2016-b_b_9389674.html,"International Women's Day is coming up on Tuesday, March 8 is International Women's Day and it is time to take a look at where we are.",2016-03-05,2016-03-05-1457192174-714709-ScreenShot20160305at7.32.16AM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-03-05-1457192174-714709-ScreenShot20160305at7.32.16AM-thumb.png,"Written in conjunction with the Global Fund For WomenTuesday, March 8 is International Women's Day and it is time to take a look at where we are.In 2015 there was increased attention and leadership action to advocate for women and girls around the world. In particular we saw exciting new levels of attention on women's human rights. 2016 could be an important year for women and girls, but only if we continue to work together to advocate for women and girls worldwide. Below are five ways we can work together.Data was collected--McKinsey & Company revealed that global GDP could increase by up to $12 trillion in 2025 through advancing gender equality, and the No Ceilings project from the Clinton and Gates Foundations released data including that the workforce gender gap hasn't changed in 20 years. This attention, in part, brought leaders in Silicon Valley to use their power and voice to promote gender equity for women in the United States. Mark Benioff of Salesforce spent an additional $3 million dollars after analyzing the gender pay gap in his company, and Mark Zuckerberg gave a signal to men by taking a paternity leave and offering 4 months paternity leave for all employees at Facebook. This movement by the media and our leaders inspired us to think about how we can use this momentum to change the lives of women and girls in 2016. Global Fund for Women fundraises to support women-led grassroots organizations around the world and has seen that the key to social change is to invest in women on the ground who are solving the gender equity issues in their communities. In 2016 there are many ways we can support these women and girls. Here are a few highlights to consider. 1. Keeping women and girls safeDespite some progress, gender-based violence remains one of the most entrenched problems facing women and girls in all countries, of all backgrounds. More than one in three women worldwide have experienced physical violence, and one in 10 girls under the age of 18 has been raped. We need to buck these statistics. Women and girls know how to address the complex issue from its roots in their own communities and unique cultural contexts. We also know that conflict and post-conflict regions, as well as those with growing numbers of refugees, are ripe for increased sexual violence, and that extremist groups like ISIS are using rape and sexual slavery as one of their horrific tactics. Violence against women has become a normalized part of life in refugee camps in Lebanon, among other places, with street harassment and rape becoming more common, as well as forced and child marriage. Despite these threats, women's groups in the refugee camps are leading workshops and trainings to educate women and girls about their human rights, encouraging them to share their stories, and empowering them to speak up to demand their rights. When it comes to ending violence against women in all of its ugly forms, we must invest in women-led groups on the ground who are driving sustainable change to end the problem once and for all. 2. Investing in girls' education""Extremists have shown what frightens them most: a girl with a book."" - Activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai When the more than 200 Chibok schoolgirls were kidnapped from their school in northern Nigeria by Boko Haram in 2014--who are still missing nearly two years later--it sparked a global outcry from world leaders, celebrities, and people all over the world using #BringBackOurGirls on social media. School is supposed to be a safe space for girls--a space where they can be free from violence, and we must continue to not only call for the safe return of the Chibok girls but do everything we can to ensure that this cannot happen again by making schools and educational institutions safe for everyone. We know that girls want to go to school to become leaders in their communities and pursue careers in everything from technology to law to entrepreneurship. But in many places around the world, girls aren't going to school because they cannot access sanitary napkins or clean toilets, or because they are being forced into early child marriages. We will not know the potential of girls around the world until we invest in their education and ensure that nothing stands in their way of going to school and continuing their education for as long as they want. 3. Raising the voice of unknown courageous leaders alongside those that have a platformIn the past year, we've heard from inspiring, well-known women leaders--women like Hillary Clinton, Melinda Gates, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel who was named Forbes' Most Powerful Woman. And while their leadership and advocacy for women's rights is critical, we need to renew our commitment this year to listening to women all over the world. We need to encourage women and girls who are marginalized to speak out. Young women like 23-year-old Milica, a law student in Serbia who is using her voice to advocate for an end to discrimination against Roma people. Many Roma women are denied their basic human rights including health care and job opportunities. Milica has found her voice as an activist at a small grassroots Roma women's center: ""Unfortunately, the biggest problem for Roma women is discrimination based on the ethnic and racial differences. Simply being Roma is a problem. It's very sad for me to talk about this. We are all people. People need to realize that a person's beauty comes from within and not whether they have pretty skin, hair, and such. It is unbelievable to me that in the 21st century we are still talking about discrimination, but unfortunately it is still present and very visible,"" says Milica. We need to show women and girls like Milica from all over the world that their stories are important and that the world is listening. 4. Getting more women leaders in politicsAlready in 2016, we have seen a major victory for women politicians: Taiwan has elected its first female President. Tsai Ing-wen won Taiwan's presidency in January, a historic step in the right direction not only for gender equality, but a positive signal for the world given that we know more women in positions of power is good for global economic growth, foreign relations, and more. But what if a female president didn't make headlines anymore because it was the norm, rather than the exception? That's the world we want to see, and one we want to continue to work toward in 2016. There are endless positive benefits for democracy, peace-building, and legislation if every woman has the equal chance to run for office, be a community leader, be a part of peace processes, or have an active voice in politics. It's time to unleash that potential. The key to doing so? Investing in grassroots women's groups and movements who are empowering more women leaders, and changing the social norms and legal restrictions to women being elected to local and national offices or involved in critical peace-building processes. Groups like Global Fund for Women grantee partner Kachin Women's Association Thailand which, with funding as part of an initiative focused on fueling women's leadership throughout Asia, influenced political parties to adopt a policy of 30% women's participation in decision-making in all levels of politics. 5. Inviting men and boysMore and more men and boys are coming forward as staunch advocates for gender equality. Major campaigns like #HeForShe have encouraged men to take action around the world, and the ""It's On Us"" campaign in the U.S. calls on men to play their part in ending sexual assault on college campuses. New Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made waves after appointing a fully gender-equal cabinet, with 15 men and 15 women, as he said, ""because it's 2015"". Of course, men committed to gender equality is nothing new. There are countless more men and boys around the world who are--and have long been--bold advocates for women's rights, committing to raising the voices of women and girls, sharing more women's stories in media, film, and online, and taking steps to close the gender pay gap. We know that gender equality is good for everyone, not just women and girls, but men and boys, and those who don't conform to traditional gender norms. When women are empowered economically and politically, and can live free from violence and have control over their bodies and health, the benefits for families, communities, and countries are vast. In fact, women and girls' economic empowerment boosts global GDP. We want to invite more men and boys around the world to be part of the conversation, to be part of the solution to ending violence and systemic inequality. The possibilities for advancing gender equality in 2016 are endless, but only with more men and boys involved.So, in 2016, will you join us as Champions for Equality? Let's invest in economic empowerment, in ending violence against women, and driving women's human rights around the world. We're working toward a world where every woman and girl is strong, safe, powerful, and heard--no exceptions. And we know that investing in women and girls is the key to making that vision a reality. Women and girls are fierce and resilient. In 2016, let's empower them to work their magic and make this world better for all of us.Follow the Global Fund for Women This post is part of a blog series produced by The Huffington Post in conjunction with International Women's Day, celebrated on March 8, 2016.

19,RELIGION,Muhammad as Spirit of Truth: A Christian Testimony Against Islamophobia,"Ian Mevorach, ContributorTheologian, minister, ethicist, and activist; co-founder of Co...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/muhammad-as-spirit-of-tru_b_9389642.html,"Today as Christians we have the opportunity to embrace Muhammad, the Qur'an, and Islam in an expression of faith in Jesus.",2016-03-05,"blackboard concept, signs of world religions - major religions group chalked on a blackboard",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb80fe0240000500098b435.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Islamophobia has been on the rise in the United States ever since 9/11. The Republican Presidential primary has both revealed this troubling trend and exacerbated it. Trump and other politicians have been trading on fear and hatred of Muslims for political expediency. They build on a foundation that has been laid, in large degree, by a consistent stream of Islamophobic rhetoric from the Christian Right. Now we have a xenophobic mood in this country that reminds people of the rise of Nazism in Germany.When Hitler came to power in Germany, a vocal minority of Christian leaders--the Confessing Church movement--opposed Nazism. Among the leaders of this movement, Dietrich Bonhoeffer is the most notable. He died in prison after participating in a failed conspiracy to assassinate Hitler. In his prison writings, he disavowed Christian anti-Semitism and embraced the fact that Jesus Christ was a Jew. In doing so he broke with the historic anti-Semitism of Lutheranism and of Christianity in general which can be traced back to the early centuries of Christianity. For example, leaders like Archbishop of Constantinople John Chrysostom (mid-late 4th century), who is regarded as a saint, preached with hatred and vitriol against his Jewish neighbors, blaming them for killing Christ. His sermons incited mob violence against Jews. This kind of scapegoating of Jews is so entrenched in Christianity it can even be clearly seen in the Gospels themselves. In the Gospel of John Jews are called ""children of the devil"" and in the Gospel of Matthew Jewish bystanders at Jesus' execution say, ""His blood be on us and on our children"" (Matt 27:25, NRSV). Since the Shoah (Holocaust), mainstream Christians, including Protestants, Catholics, and Orthodox Christians have fundamentally revised our views on Jews and Judaism; we've acknowledged Christianity's historic anti-Semitism and no longer blame Jews for killing Christ or attempt to convert Jews to Christianity. Today, Christian leaders of conscience are called to take a vocal stand against Islamophobia. We are called to root Islamophobia out of our religion before it leads to another genocidal catastrophe.As is the case with Christian anti-Semitism, Christian Islamophobia has deep roots. In the oldest Christian writings on Islam, St. John of Damascus' Against Heresies (8th century CE), Muhammad is presented as a heretic inspired by the devil; Islam itself is categorized as a Christian heresy. Tragically, this has been the dominant Christian assessment of Muhammad and Islam up until the present day, with influential figures such as Dante, Thomas Aquinas, and Martin Luther all making similarly inflammatory claims. In the 15th century, Nicholas of Cusa was distressed by the wars between Christians and Muslims and sought to unify the religions theologically. However, he did not succeed and instead ended up writing a diatribe refuting the Qur'an and again framing Muhammad as a devil-inspired heretic. The most notable counter-example to this rather dismal tradition of Christian polemic against Islam is St. Francis of Assisi. During the crusades of the 13th century, Francis was successful in dialoging with Sultan Malek al-Kamil of Egypt and negotiating a truce between Christian and Muslim fighters. The Sultan was not interested in negotiating with the Pope or any other leader, but only with Francis, whom he admired and trusted as a person of integrity, peace, and devotion to God. The Christian Right in the United States has not invented Islamophobia, they are merely continuing this hateful vein of the Christian tradition. From the beginning, Christians have reacted to Islam in a spirit of competition and mistrust. Instead of embracing and appreciating Islam as a sibling faith, Christians have tried to discredit Islam. Now, in the 21st century, it is high time for Christians to acknowledge how wrong we have been. Islam is the second-largest religion on the planet and is an integral part of human civilization as we know it. Islam is a beautiful, complex religion that supports human dignity, arts and sciences, spirituality, economic, environmental and racial justice, and so much more. As Christians today we are called to acknowledge the integrity of Islam and embrace Muslims as brothers and sisters in faith. And the key, I believe, to making this paradigm shift is choosing to see Muhammad differently, in light of our faith. Just as Bonhoeffer embraced the fact that Jesus Christ was a Jew, thus identifying himself as a Christian with and for Jews, so too Christians today have the opportunity to identify ourselves with and for Muslims by positively identifying Jesus with Muhammad. The foundation of Christian Islamophobia (fear of Islam) is a rejection of Muhammad as a spirit of error; the foundation of Christian Islamophilia (love of Islam) is an embrace of Muhammad as a spirit of truth. Jesus, in the Gospel of John, predicts the coming of a future prophet he calls ""the spirit of truth"": ""I still have many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth; for he will not speak on his own, but will speak whatever he hears, and he will declare to you the things that are to come. He will glorify me, because he will take what is mine and declare it to you. All that the Father has is mine. For this reason I said that he will take what is mine and declare it to you."" (John 16:12-15, NRSV)Today as Christians we have the opportunity to embrace Muhammad, the Qur'an, and Islam in an expression of faith in Jesus. This kind of embrace would have major political implications and would radically alter the quality of Christian-Muslim relations. We have the chance now to acknowledge and let go of Christianity's polemical reactions against Islam, and to seek a collaborative relationship with Muslims. This crucial adaptation of Christianity--choosing to see Muhammad as a ""spirit of truth"" whom Jesus said would guide us into all the truth--will allow Christianity and Islam to work together for peace, justice, and the healing of Earth; it will help put an end to the predisposition of Christians to mistrust and fear Muslims. In the Qur'an, Jesus says, ""'O Children of Israel! Truly I am the Messenger of God unto you, confirming that which came before me in the Torah and bearing glad tidings of a Messenger to come after me whose name is Ahmad'"" (61:6, The Study Quran). In this verse we have a vision of Jesus that affirms both Judaism and Islam; this is the vision of Jesus I believe that Christians are being called by God to adopt in the 21st century. Imagine a Christianity that could embrace the full Jewish-Christian-Muslim canon of sacred literature and engage in a free-flowing theological and ethical dialogue with Jewish and Muslim neighbors. Imagine a Christianity open to the transformation and healing this dialogue would bring to the whole Abrahamic family of faith. Yes, Christianity has made major mistakes in regards to both Judaism and Islam; our tradition is replete with anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. But it is within our power to learn from our history and course-correct going forward. Our tradition's first assessment of Muhammad has been a disaster and has fueled centuries of conflict between Christians and Muslims. But it is not too late to recognize Muhammad as the one Jesus promises he will send to us: ""the spirit of truth who comes from the Father, he will testify on my behalf"" (John 15:26b, NRSV). ""You also are to testify,"" Jesus says, ""because you have been with me from the beginning"" (John 15:27, NRSV). As faithful followers of Jesus, it is time for us to testify about the integrity of Muhammad and Islam, to testify that Jews and Muslims are our closest siblings in faith. This testimony can help set a new course for a century and a millennium of peace between Jews, Christians, and Muslims."
20,POLITICS,GOP Activists Increasingly Concerned The Republican Convention Will Be A Brawl,Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-contested-convention-cpac_us_56d9dd45e4b0000de4047c0c,"With Donald Trump as the front-runner, a fractured party is barreling toward a clash later this summer.",2016-03-04,"RNC Chair Reince Priebus (left) talks with Sean Hannity at CPAC March 4, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d9f2b11e0000870070357e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. -- Reince Priebus says he is almost certain the wild race for the GOP presidential nomination will be neatly wrapped up before the party's convention later this summer.Addressing hundreds of activists at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference, the chairman of the Republican National Committee attempted to tamp down on talk of a contested convention, putting the odds of such a scenario at just 10 to 15 percent.“Whoever the nominee is, they’re going to get the full backing and 100 percent support of the Republican Party,” Priebus told Sean Hannity, the conservative Fox News host who has been sympathetic to Donald Trump’s campaign.“Whoever the majority chooses is going to be the nominee of our party. The people are going to decide. There’s no way that the people won’t decide. There’s no way that the delegates won’t decide,” Priebus assuaged Hannity and Trump supporters in the crowd, who clapped approvingly.Supporters of Trump’s bid have ample reason for concern, Priebus’ attempts to soothe notwithstanding. On Wednesday, 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney came out forcefully against the brash businessman, calling him a “phony” and a “fraud” who was “playing the American people for suckers.” Romney urged his party to vote strategically for either Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) or Ohio Gov. John Kasich in order to deny Trump the number of delegates he needs to secure the nomination later this summer.The broadside clearly hit a nerve with Trump. Later that day, the real estate mogul claimed Romney would attempt to wrest the nomination away from him during the 11th hour -- something the former Massachusetts governor has repeatedly denied.“Mitt is going to run,” Trump said at a rally in Portland, Maine. “There’s going to be a third attempt. I still think he has the desire to run, maybe at the convention.""But for all of the GOP’s attempts to put on a brave face, the mood among advocates and activists gathered at Gaylord National Hotel just a few miles from Washington, D.C. was resigned.“I think the path is a brokered convention,” said Alfonso Aguilar, executive director of the Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles, a conservative Hispanic organization. “If you’re going into a brokered convention, we have to make sure that Trump doesn’t have the vast majority of delegates. If he goes in there with a majority of delegates, then it’ll be very hard.""Aguilar pointed to Sunday's GOP primary in Puerto Rico as a key moment that, depending on its outcome, would lead to a contested convention.“If Trump were to win in Puerto Rico, that’ll be devastating for [Rubio],” Aguilar said, citing a poll showing the businessman within striking distance of victory.Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist said he could envision a scenario that involved a contested convention, but he remained skeptical that the party could orderly settle on a candidate.""You can't trade [delegates] unless somebody's in charge of the trading. I have no idea how that would work,"" he told HuffPost.Even Kasich said he was convinced a dramatic showdown awaited his campaign at the convention this summer. On stage at CPAC on Friday, Kasich put on a happy air and said conventions were a ""cool"" educational opportunity for America.“It has to be done fairly,” he said in a Q&A session with Hannity. “You have to do it right, you can’t have a bunch of people in smoke-filled rooms. My only fear of a convention is that these connected interests would dominate.”Other attendees at CPAC echoed the sentiment -- although they were mostly concerned about a particular presidential candidate who has a penchant for being a bomb-thrower.""I think it'll go there,"" said Ben Carson supporter Jim Stacey as he waited in line to the main auditorium. ""I don't know what Trump will do, though.""Sue Gearhart of Philadelphia put it much more bluntly.""What worries me, frankly, is Trump being the choice, to be honest with you. I hope it is an open convention, unless somehow or other the trends change and somebody else is able to deny him delegates.""Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist,birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

When illegal ivory, tiger pelts or rhino tusks make their way to markets and e-commerce sites, traffickers may try to conceal how the products were obtained. They'll use terms like ""bone"" or ""walrus tusk"" to describe ivory, duping retailers and customers alike. What's more, uninformed shoppers or tourists might not know that tortoiseshell and certain types of coral or wood are also part of this illicit trade network, which is estimated to be worth between $50 and $150 billion per year. Major companies across the e-commerce, retail and travel industries are now banding together to raise awareness and reduce the amount of illegal wildlife products Americans buy. Google, eBay, Etsy, JetBlue and Tiffany & Co are among the 16 firms committing to eliminating these products from their supply chains, the U.S. Wildlife Trafficking Alliance and the Obama administration announced Thursday.“A lot of Americans are just not aware that they could be buying illegal products and adding to this global problem,” David J. Hayes, chair of the alliance and former chief operating officer at the Department of Interior, told The Huffington Post.Each company will take action within its own sphere of commerce. Some will warn customers about the impacts of illegal wildlife products, while others will flag items on sale that potentially violate wildlife policies or provide educational videos on sustainability for travelers.Several online retailers have already taken steps to block harmful items from their sites. eBay and the online bidding platform LiveAuctioneers.com have banned illegal ivory sales. Etsy has banned all ivory and prohibited sellers to list goods made from threatened or endangered animal parts. ""It's hard for the consumer to know what's legal and what's illegal, and it can be hard for the retailer to know,"" said Beth Allgood, U.S. campaigns director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare, a conservation nonprofit that has worked with eBay, Etsy and LiveAuctioneers to remove illegal ivory listings. ""We can be partners to retailers who don't know all the regulations.""For JetBlue, the awareness campaign will primarily inform passengers traveling to and from the Caribbean and Latin America, said Sophia Mendelsohn, JetBlue’s head of sustainability. In videos to be shown on JetBlue’s flights, residents and small business owners from the region will speak about how sustainable tourism practices can support wildlife diversity.“We want to stop this issue at its root cause,” Mendelsohn told HuffPost. “We’re going to cut out unwitting demand so there’s less profit in drawing out these natural resources, whether it’s for tech, necklaces or special meals” at local restaurants.Other corporate partners that have pledged to work with the alliance include Ralph Lauren and Royal Caribbean Cruises. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums will exhibit seized illegal wildlife products in its parks to highlight the threats posed to various species. Discovery Communications will produce virtual reality content focusing on trafficking and conservation. The household brands committed to this new effort will work to establish best practices for smaller names in the travel, e-commerce and retail industries.“These companies are accepting industry leadership and making sure smaller ones aren’t involved in wildlife trafficking,” Hayes said. “These are true industry-wide efforts.”Awareness of wildlife conservation has been growing for some time. President Barack Obama issued an executive order to implement a wildlife taskforce in 2013. The corporate alliance announced this week is a result of that effort.Public interest in the issue spiked last year following the killing of Cecil the Lion. The backlash against the Minnesota dentist who shot down the lion in Zimbabwe heightened scrutiny of trophy killings and spurred action from the travel industry. American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Airlines announced last summer that they would ban transport from Africa of the “big five” game animals -- lion, elephant, rhino, leopard and buffalo."

Google, eBay, Etsy, JetBlue and Tiffany & Co are among the 16 firms committing to eliminating these products from their supply chains, the U.S. Wildlife Trafficking Alliance and the Obama administration announced Thursday.“A lot of Americans are just not aware that they could be buying illegal products and adding to this global problem,” David J. Hayes, chair of the alliance and former chief operating officer at the Department of Interior, told The Huffington Post.Each company will take action within its own sphere of commerce. Some will warn customers about the impacts of illegal wildlife products, while others will flag items on sale that potentially violate wildlife policies or provide educational videos on sustainability for travelers.Several online retailers have already taken steps to block harmful items from their sites. eBay and the online bidding platform LiveAuctioneers.com have banned illegal ivory sales. Etsy has banned all ivory and prohibited sellers to list goods made from threatened or endangered animal parts. ""It's hard for the consumer to know what's legal and what's illegal, and it can be hard for the retailer to know,"" said Beth Allgood, U.S. campaigns director for the International Fund for Animal Welfare, a conservation nonprofit that has worked with eBay, Etsy and LiveAuctioneers to remove illegal ivory listings. ""We can be partners to retailers who don't know all the regulations.""For JetBlue, the awareness campaign will primarily inform passengers traveling to and from the Caribbean and Latin America, said Sophia Mendelsohn, JetBlue’s head of sustainability. In videos to be shown on JetBlue’s flights, residents and small business owners from the region will speak about how sustainable tourism practices can support wildlife diversity.“We want to stop this issue at its root cause,” Mendelsohn told HuffPost. “We’re going to cut out unwitting demand so there’s less profit in drawing out these natural resources, whether it’s for tech, necklaces or special meals” at local restaurants.Other corporate partners that have pledged to work with the alliance include Ralph Lauren and Royal Caribbean Cruises. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums will exhibit seized illegal wildlife products in its parks to highlight the threats posed to various species. Discovery Communications will produce virtual reality content focusing on trafficking and conservation. The household brands committed to this new effort will work to establish best practices for smaller names in the travel, e-commerce and retail industries.“These companies are accepting industry leadership and making sure smaller ones aren’t involved in wildlife trafficking,” Hayes said. “These are true industry-wide efforts.”Awareness of wildlife conservation has been growing for some time. President Barack Obama issued an executive order to implement a wildlife taskforce in 2013. The corporate alliance announced this week is a result of that effort.Public interest in the issue spiked last year following the killing of Cecil the Lion. The backlash against the Minnesota dentist who shot down the lion in Zimbabwe heightened scrutiny of trophy killings and spurred action from the travel industry. American Airlines, United Airlines and Delta Airlines announced last summer that they would ban transport from Africa of the “big five” game animals -- lion, elephant, rhino, leopard and buffalo."
23,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Campaign Sets The Bar Low For Upcoming Caucuses,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-democratic-caucuses_us_56d9a5e1e4b0000de4043b82,But her team argues that she still has the advantage in the long run.,2016-03-04,"Nebraska Democrats are caucusing on Saturday, March 5. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_0_4284_2647%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) could come out a winner in most of the weekend's presidential primary contests -- and that's according to his competitor, who is already trying to manage expectations. Kansas and Nebraska Democrats hold their caucuses Saturday, while Louisiana will have its primary election that day. Maine Democrats will caucus on Sunday.Robby Mook, campaign manager for Hillary Clinton, sent out a memo Wednesday that predicted the former secretary of state may lose the caucus states this weekend. ""[A]lthough we continue to fight for every vote, Sen. Sanders has clear advantages and is investing heavily in two upcoming caucuses (Nebraska and Kansas),"" Mook wrote.In Nebraska, for example, Sanders has spent more than double what Clinton has on TV ads in the state's two biggest markets. Sanders attracted big crowds for his rally in Portland, Maine, this week, telling supporters he could win in the state if there's ""large turnout.""""We were up against the candidate supported by the entire political establishment, someone who had been anointed by the pundits,"" he said of Clinton. ""Well guess what? It doesn't look like she's so inevitable now.""The Sanders campaign agrees that it holds the upper hand in the weekend's caucuses. Tad Devine, Sanders' senior campaign strategist, told reporters this week that the calendar post-Super Tuesday doesn't look as good for Clinton. He said they hoped to win Kansas, Nebraska and Maine, as well as Michigan on March 8. Polls currently show Clinton with a significant lead in that state, however. ""We still think we have a winning hand in this game and we're going to continue to play it,"" Devine added. But Clinton's team still expects to win the Louisiana primary, a southern state with a more diverse electorate that plays to her strength with communities of color. And at the end of the day, they're arguing that it's less about winning states than about amassing more delegates.""As she has to date, Sec. Clinton will continue to win diverse states by large margins -- enabling her to add to her pledged delegate lead -- and she will compete in every state with a strategy uniquely tailored to each state so that Sen. Sanders cannot net too many delegates anywhere,"" Mook wrote.In the Democratic system, states award their delegates proportionally based on the share of votes the candidates get (provided they get at least 15 percent). So a loss in close race could still pay off, and a big win is better than a small one. A Democratic candidate needs 2,383 delegates to clinch the nomination. Clinton currently has 1,058 (which includes 457 superdelegates), and Sanders has 431 (including 22 super delegates). Both Clinton and Sanders are already looking ahead not only to Michigan, but the delegate-rich date of March 15, when Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio will be holding their primaries. Florida holds the largest number of delegates to date, and Clinton currently holds the lead there, according to polls. "

Dr. Freddy Haynes, a senior pastor of Friendship-West Baptist Church in Dallas, Texas, during a conference call with reporters.""I find it painfully ironic that the same voices that denounced Donald Trump for blatant racism, but in a very sophisticated, undermining fashion, are holding democracy and justice hostage,"" Haynes added. ""As far as I'm concerned, their racism may be more subtle than Donald Trump, but it's nonetheless the same.""The clergy leaders' outrage comes after black lawmakers in Congress also called GOP senators racist for saying they wanted to wait for the next president to choose the Supreme Court nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia -- hoping, of course, that a Republican claims the White House.The Rev. Dr. James Perkins, president of the Progressive National Baptist Convention, said Republicans are hypocritical when it comes to the constitution, picking and choosing what to follow. He said the only difference between Trump and the Senate is that the reality TV star doesn't have a vote.""In a sense, they are worse than Trump. Because they have the power to act or to kill the rightful constitutional action in this process. This is even more dangerous,"" Perkins said. In February, leaders of the National African American Clergy Network and multiple black religious leaders sent a letter to McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), calling on them to consider Obama's nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court. They said they never received a response to their letter. The members of the black clergy said they find what the Senate is doing unprecedented, deeply disrespectful and a historic affront. They want Obama to be treated like every white president that came before him.Ultimately, they are tired of seeing Obama being treated like a ""second-class president.""""The Senate of the United States is on strike against the constitution of the United States,"" said Rev. Dr. Otis Moss, Jr., a civil rights icon and co-chair of the National African American Clergy.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist,misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Donald Trump, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich pose for a photo at the beginning of the Republican presidential debate in Detroit on March 3, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d9d8151500002a000b139d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump's Republican presidential rivals have been vocal about his shortcomings -- Sen. Marco Rubio's campaign is even selling #NeverTrump merchandise. But, when pressed by a moderator at Thursday night's debate, they all pledged to support Trump should he become the party's nominee.GOP voters, new polling suggests, may end up coming to the same conclusion.Trump is unusually unpopular for a front-runner, FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver points out. To date, exit polling indicates that just 49 percent of voters say they'd be satisfied to see him as the nominee. Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), though, each fare only slightly better. And Republicans are just as likely to say they would back Trump in a general election as they are to say they would support either Cruz or Rubio, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted before Super Tuesday.Sixty-eight percent of Republican primary voters say they would vote for Trump if he becomes the party nominee, with a roughly equal 65 percent saying the same of Rubio and Cruz. (Another recent poll, conducted for CNN, found more of a divide.)The fact that none of the party's three leading candidates has locked down more than about two-thirds of voters suggests a certain lack of cohesion within the GOP. In comparison, more than 75 percent of Democrats say they'd vote either for former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton or Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in the general election.Of the Republican voters who didn't commit to backing a specific candidate, most said they're still undecided or aren't planning to vote at all. Just 8 percent say they'd vote for a Democrat over Trump, while 7 percent and 5 percent say the same about Cruz and Rubio, respectively. Those numbers are pretty much in line with voting patterns from the 2012 election, during which 7 percent of Republicans ended up voting against the party's nominee, Mitt Romney.Trying to measure support in a general election that hasn't even started is something of a fool's errand: With so many candidates' hats still in the ring and months of campaigning yet to come, polls tend not to be predictive of much. If a significant number of conservative leaders rebel against Trump, rank-and-file voters could eventually follow. But it's not necessarily clear at this point whether Trump is significantly more divisive than his rivals.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted March 1-3 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling.

26,BUSINESS,4 Things You Need To Know About The Latest Jobs Report,Shane Ferro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jobs-report-february-2016_us_56d9830ce4b0ffe6f8e8f349,America's economy is chugging along.,2016-03-04,There's a huge racial disparity in the unemployment rate in this country.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d9993b1500002a000b133e.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The monthly jobs report came out on Friday, and things are pretty good overall.The big headline numbers were great: The economy added 242,000 jobs in February, much higher than the 195,000 that economists estimated, and the unemployment rate remained at 4.9 percent, which is nice and low. But if you drill down into the data, the picture is a little murkier.Here are four things we know about the economy from the details in this report:1) Wages aren't growing much, and it's hard to say why.Average hourly earnings were down by 3 cents in February, to $25.35. Year-over-year, wages are up about 2.2 percent. That's not great -- although, thanks to very low oil prices and low inflation, it's not terrible either. But it's worth asking why wage growth since 2010 hasn't been as robust as growth in previous recoveries. 2) Nonetheless, people are coming back into the labor force.As we said earlier, the economy added 242,000 jobs this month. But perhaps more importantly, details in the household survey show that more than 500,000 entered the labor force by starting to look for work again. In order to be officially unemployed, a person must not have a job and must be looking for work. Discouraged workers, who have given up looking for jobs, aren't counted as part of the labor force. It's a sign of a healthy economy when those people start looking for jobs again, even if they don't find work immediately.3) But the unemployment rate for blacks is twice the unemployment rate for whites.The unemployment rate for whites in the United States is 4.3 percent. For blacks, it's 8.8 percent. This is an economic dynamic that has been persistent since the Labor Department started tracking unemployment by race back in the 1970s. The chart below is not really America's best look: 4) There is a lot of growth in low-wage industries.The retail industry added 55,000 jobs last month, and food service added 40,000. These have been some of the strongest growth industries over the last few years, which means the economy is adding a lot of low wage, service sector jobs. That said, the economy also added a lot of health care (38,000) and construction (19,000) jobs in February, which tend to pay quite well. "

Reddish areas highlight the plains, craters and valleys around the mountains. The bright, light-colored peaks are believed to be coated in frozen methane.The images are the latest to be published from data collected during the New Horizon's July 2015 flyby of Pluto.

28,POLITICS,Conservative Millennials Are Terrified Of Donald Trump,Eliot Nelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conservative-millennials-are-terrified-of-donald-trump_us_56d9d90fe4b0ffe6f8e942a8,The kids are all right.,2016-03-04,"Donald Trump's support isn't solid among young conservatives, some of whom gathered in National Harbor, Maryland, for the annual Conservative Political Action Conference this week.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d9e0f21e00008700703555.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NATIONAL HARBOR, Md. -- ""Is #CPAC2016 coachella for conservatives?"" @jujufresh12 tweeted the night before the 2016 Conservative Political Action Conference kicked off just outside of Washington, D.C. It's not an unfair question. Many Republican campaign events or tea party rallies can feel like a retirement home's lecture night, with speakers hauled in to scare a bunch of old people. But CPAC is markedly younger, packed with eager millennials casting furtive glances at one another during breakout sessions on the Tenth Amendment. There are fewer Native American headdresses -- not to mention snide remarks about ""Native American"" and the PC police -- and the pastel colors mostly originate from Brooks Brothers, but it's probably the closest the movement will ever get to the California music festival of Coachella. CPAC's young'uns are experimenting with a mind-altering substance, to boot. But unlike Coachella's hordes, it's not a pill with a smiley face that someone slipped them in a plastic bag; it's an orange-hued New York real estate developer turned reality star who is nevertheless removing them from their sense of reality and causing a heightened sense of paranoia. That anxiety and confusion may not have been evident during the impromptu dance party at the Turning Point USA pavilion, or at the ""Engaging Millennials"" breakout session (""Be authentic""), or in all the attendees' starstruck exclamations (""Oh my god, Emma, guess who we just saw? Thom Tillis!""). But it was there. ""This election has been a complete roller coaster with Trump in the race,"" said Matthew Schargel, a student at Catholic University in Washington. ""I know the hashtag surfaced this week, #NeverTump -- I would count myself as part of that."" ""He's basically just taking the party system where the right is overtly populist and nationalist, and that really scares me,"" added Devon, a 19-year-old Marine stationed at Camp Johnson in Jacksonville, North Carolina. CPAC is freaking out, man.Youth support for Donald Trump has been mixed, and the general lack of enthusiasm for The Donald at this year's Conservative Political Action Conference among millennials illustrates the extent to which CPAC -- and the tea party, as well -- no longer represents the Republican Party's insurgent wing. Instead, it's just one-third of a Republican Party composed of establishment, conservative and populist camps. If the mood at CPAC is any indication, the conservative camp, including its young activists, is not eager to Make America Great Again. ""I really don't like Donald Trump, I don't think he has good politics whatsoever,"" said Victoria, a Marco Rubio supporter and student at Elon University in North Carolina, who added that Trump is ""very conceited."" ""I could never go in there and actually vote for him,"" said Abby Titus, a freshman at Hillsdale College in Hillsdale, Michigan. ""I'm not sure what I would actually do."" The Trump campaign's last-minute decision to cancel his appearance at CPAC may have been for the best. While the convention is not without its very vocal Trump supporters, the 43 percent of GOP voters who support him nationally were underrepresented here. Most of the young voters interviewed at this year's CPAC said they supported Sens. Marco Rubio (R-Florida) or Ted Cruz (R-Texas), drawn to their staunchly conservative platforms. Josh, 19, from Massachusetts, said he was drawn to Cruz's unapologetically conservative platform but was supporting Rubio, whom he viewed as a more electable candidate.But asked who they would support in the event of a Donald Trump nomination, reactions were more varied, though most insisted they couldn't bring themselves to vote for the former ""Apprentice"" host. ""I would not vote for Trump. If we as Republicans nominate someone who espouses what he believes, then I think that we deserve Hillary Clinton,"" lamented Nick Vaughn, a student at North Carolina's Wingate University. ""I would write in 'Jesus,'"" speculated Tavia Vitkauskas, also a freshman at Hillsdale College. ""There'd be no hope, it'd be over."" ""I'd probably either vote for the Constitution Party,"" Josh from San Diego said, ""or write in somebody cool like my dad."" Not all millennial voters at CPAC were so hostile to Trump, but most who said they would consider voting for him in a general election did so very reluctantly.""I might have to ride out the Trump thing and pray to Jesus,"" speculated Julie Havlak, also a Hillsdale College freshman. George, another Elon University student and a supporter of Ohio Gov. John Kasich, said he would vote for Trump, but added, ""The best case I'm hoping for is a contested convention.""He continued, ""I tend to be an optimist, so I try to make the best of a situation and hope that maybe through all the muck, there's something worth appreciating about him as a nominee.""Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
29,ENTERTAINMENT,Adam Lambert Finds 'The Original High' In New York City,Cole Delbyck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/adam-lambert-concert-review_us_56d9b0dde4b0ffe6f8e91788,"Walked in a fan, left a Glambert.",2016-03-04,"Adam Lambert performs in concert at Terminal 5 on March 3, 2016 in New York City.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d9b3a51e00008700703504.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Full disclosure time: I entered Adam Lambert's show at Terminal 5 in New York City on Thursday night as a fair-weather fan, appreciating his brand of glam rock from afar, but never fully committing to his post-""American Idol"" career. Sure, I've danced to a club remix of ""Whataya Want From Me,"" but what self-respecting gay man in his 20s hasn't?Somehow, I walked out of the venue after the show covered in glitter, wearing a tiger-striped Lambert concert tee and wondering why I'd never gone full Glambert before. If the intention of his Original High tour for his album of the same name was to uplift audiences, then I was feeling high AF. Since finishing as the runner-up on the eighth season of ""American Idol,"" Lambert has adeptly adjusted to the sometimes treacherous post-reality-show reality, releasing three critically and commercially successful albums, scoring a Grammy nomination and completing two tours with iconic rock group Queen.The 34-year-old singer has also managed to remain unapologetically queer since his ""Idol"" days, championing LGBT causes both on and off stage. (Remember the outrage when he made out with his male keyboardist during the 2009 AMAs?) But what has kept Lambert relevant seven years after his turn on ""Idol"" is his voice. Described by Queen guitarist Brian May as a sound that ""reaches out with sensitivity, depth, maturity, and awesome range and power which will make jaws drop all around the world,"" Lambert's vocal talents were the focal point of his New York show. If there's anything that ""Idol"" teaches its contestants to do, it's how to sing live and how to do it well. Starting the set with the funk-infused dance track ""Evil in the Night,"" Lambert's high-tempo opener was a fix for the dance-deprived crowd, which was a strange mix of New Jersey moms, fangirls, gay boys and celebs like Tyler Oakley and Betty Who. Dressed in a geometric black-and-white number accented with sparkly high-top shoes and his tattoo-covered arms, Lambert performance exuded confidence and sexuality. Next, he treated fans to the lead single off of the album, ""Ghost Town,"" which happens to bear a similar name to that one Madonna song. The track begins with a deceptive acoustic guitar riff, quickly scrubbed away by a thundering house beat. Lambert, along with his two backup dancers, upped the ante with a surprising amount of choreography that never detracted from the singer's vocal power. You heard it here first, folks: Adam Lambert can grind and body roll with the best of 'em. It go so hot and heavy that at one point a fan chucked a pair of underwear with the words ""Sugar Daddy"" emblazoned on the back onstage. ""You can't throw shit at my face, bitch. Not this face, c'mon,"" he responded off the cuff before adding, ""I'll be your sugar daddy.""Although his new album has its fair share of hits (see ""Another Lonely Night"" and ""The Original High"") the crowd went from zero to alone-in-your-bathroom style belting, as the room collectively sang (screamed?) Lambert's most popular song, ""Whataya Want From Me.""In addition to the highly performative nature of his music, a strong current of self-acceptance and ""Born This Way""-light messaging ran throughout the show, reaching its peak with lyrics like ""It's me, I'm a freak / But thanks for lovin' me / 'Cause you're doing it perfectly.""During one interlude, Lambert thanked his fans, who ""accept me the way I am"" and made it clear that he is nothing without their support. The thing that I've noticed about breaking out of theatre and breaking out of LA and traveling is that no matter where you're from, no matter how old you are, or what the color of your skin is, no matter what gender you are, no matter what religion you are, what sexual preference you are, however you want to label yourself, which is getting so passé anyway, we're all human beings. And you know what? We all got hearts. They're the same damn organ and they feel a lot of the same shit and that's what I love. I love that music can connect us and bring us together. Yeah, it was a little hokey and might qualify for an eye roll, but in the moment the declaration was authentic and clearly resonated with the New Jersey moms in the audience. Just kidding -- I was into it too. Rest assured, he quickly got back in the groove with a praiseworthy ""Let's Dance"" David Bowie tribute and a cover of Queen's ""Another One Bites the Dust."" Considering how deeply Lambert has benefited from the legacies of both performers, honoring the two was a superb finish to the show. His last message to the audience? ""Go get laid!"""

Now, a Florida activist group plans to express their distaste for Trump by hitting him where it counts.Members of the group, which calls itself the Church of Satanic Activism or ""The Church,"" are planning to attend the Republican debate at the University of Miami on March 10, dressed in inflatable penis costumes in a less-than-subtle nod to Trump. They'll don the phallic ensembles, once again, at various polling spots throughout Florida on March 15, the day of the state's primary. Political activist Chaz Stevens, who founded ""The Church,"" is no stranger to cheeky demonstrations. He made headlines in December when he won approval to erect an LGBT-themed ""Festivus Pole"" in rainbow colors and topped with a disco ball in the Oklahoma Capitol rotunda. That decoration was a nod to the fictional holiday ""Festivus,"" which was featured in a 1997 episode of ""Seinfeld."" Like the ""Festivus Pole,"" Stevens' plans are also rooted in holiday lore. In this case, he says, the costumes are a reference to Japan's Shinto Kanamara Matsuri, or the ""Festival of the Steel Phallus,"" which is an obscure celebration of fertility that incorporates penis-shaped adornments each spring. Stevens, who identifies as straight but says he is deeply committed to activism around LGBT issues, also plans to observe the event in Florida by impersonating Trump as an enormous penis that spews gold confetti. ""Donald J. Trump’s a real dick, so it wasn’t much of a stretch,"" Stevens told The Huffington Post. ""The timing is perfect. The GOP is coming to Florida, Florida is shaped like a giant dong, and a dong is leading the GOP."" Although Stevens is willing to criticize the government and the 2016 U.S. election, he said he's aware that the odds are stacked against him in terms of getting his message across. ""They’ve got the guns, lawyers, money and pretty much everything else. All we have is a couple of guys with wicked senses of humor,"" he said. ""Our sort of protest helps us somewhat level the playing field."" He pointed to the words of economist Jonathan Gruber, who is credited as the key architect behind Obamacare, who once referenced ""the stupidity of the American voter,"" in explaining the success of Trump's campaign.As to what he'd say to Trump for bringing his genitals into the democratic process, Stevens quipped, ""Dipsh*t, you're fired!"" Note to our readers: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Hellerstedt, a case that's as much about a woman's constitutional right to choose as about who gets to impose rules around that choice.But it was Ginsburg, the court's matriarch, who seemed the most invested in the nearly 85-minute session on Wednesday. She asked the first and last questions of both sides of the case -- the clinics fighting to stay open and the state of Texas -- but saved her most pointed darts by far for the Lone Star state. When Scott Keller, the Texas solicitor general, namedropped Kermit Gosnell as the linchpin for the state's case -- the convicted abortion doctor also featured prominently in the state's legal filings -- she just about had it.""As I understand it, this is one of the lowest­-risk procedures, and you give a horrible from Pennsylvania, but absolutely nothing from Texas,"" Ginsburg said. ""As far as we know, this is among the most safe, the least-risk procedures -- an early­-stage abortion.""Then she pressed: ""So what was ... the problem that the legislature was responding to that it needed to improve the facilities for women's health?""Protecting women's health, it turns out, is the chief justification Texas has advanced for its law, the controversial H.B.2., which requires abortion clinics to upgrade to hospital-grade facilities and abortion doctors to possess admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. This regulatory scheme threatens to shutter all but 10 clinics in the state and leave millions of women with restricted access to reproductive care. Texas tried hard to downplay this effect. In his preamble, Keller proclaimed that ""abortion is legal and accessible in Texas."" Texas lawmakers, Keller said, ""acted to improve abortion safety"" -- a legitimate interest he said is allowed under the Constitution.Ginsburg and her female colleagues were far from convinced. When Keller pointed to the biggest, most populous cities in the great state of Texas -- where clinics are complying with the law -- as proof that the procedure would remain available elsewhere if the court upheld the law, Ginsburg took him to task for what is likely the state's weakest argument.""Well, how many women are located over 100 miles from the nearest clinic?"" she asked.That's when the slow and painful unraveling of Keller began. He conceded that ""25 percent"" of women -- by which he meant roughly 1.5 million -- do. To him that was no harm, no foul. He reasoned that some women could always go to nearby New Mexico, which doesn't have the same restrictions on abortion clinics as Texas.""That's odd that you point to the New Mexico facility,"" Ginsburg shot back. ""If your argument is right, then New Mexico is not an available way out for Texas, because Texas says to protect our women, we need these things."" Instead, she said, the state proposed to ""send them off"" to New Mexico, whose clinics are not subject to any of Texas' health-conscious regulations.Ginsburg has a big stake in this fight. The last time the Supreme Court spoke on abortion, in 2007, it was five men, with Justice Anthony Kennedy in the lead, who tore into the two leading precedents on abortion, 1973's Roe v. Wade and 1992's Planned Parenthood v. Casey.""Today's decision is alarming,"" Ginsburg warned in her dissent in the 2007 case, adding that the court's decision making ""cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to chip away at a right declared again and again by this Court -- and with increasing comprehension of its centrality to women's lives.""Her younger companions on the bench echoed some of these sentiments on Wednesday.""What's the need"" for the law, Sotomayor wondered, that ""the slightest health improvement is enough to impose on hundreds of thousands of women"" in the great state of Texas the burden of traveling hundreds of miles to reach an abortion provider. Kagan piled on with facts and figures on how Texas women today are farther from a clinic than they were prior to H.B.2's passage.As Slate's Dahlia Lithwick observed, Chief Justice John Roberts seemed to have no choice but to throw up his arms as the female justices barreled through -- letting them run the show and giving them extra time if they asked for it. They probably had a tactical reason for running circles around Keller: The Texas advocate is a former law clerk to Kennedy, whose conflicted record on the constitutionality of abortion puts him in the driver's seat of the case, for better or for worse.Lest Kennedy is unsure of what to do -- and that's a reasonable possibility -- Ginsburg's closing salvo for Keller may give him some pause. The entirety of the Whole Woman's Health case, after all, is less about what is or isn't an appropriate abortion regulation, and more about whether the regulations unduly burden a woman's choice -- a constitutional right the Supreme Court last secured in the 1992 Casey decision.When the court examines whether the Texas law tramples on that right, ""you don't look to all the women who are getting abortions,"" Ginsburg said. ""You look only to­­ the women for whom this is a problem. And so the only women we would be looking at is not all of the women ...­­ who live in Austin or in Dallas, but the women who have the problem -- who don't live near a clinic.""What's at stake ""is that a woman has a fundamental right to make this choice for herself,"" Ginsburg said.Spoken as if her entire tenure on the court depended on it."

To us, our religion and our belief, the body is the temple,"" Wade told AZCentral after his mom's conviction. ""The body is sacred. That may include the genitals. In fact, I'm pretty sure it does.” Some of the rituals involving that sacred temple are described in some detail below.The alleged erotic activities at the Goddess Temple came to light in February 2011, when the Phoenix New Times reported about the church's ""services,"" including genital touching in exchange for ""religious offerings"" ranging from $204 to $650.The newspaper went into detail about one session with a ""goddess"" named ""Aphrodite"":About 40 minutes into the session, Clayton turns over on his back. He doesn't have an erection. Aphrodite proposes a prostate massage. She puts on a ""finger condom"" and inserts a finger into his anus, while simultaneously gripping and stroking his penis.Elise and 17 other members of the Phoenix Goddess Temple were indicted seven months later in September after a police raid.On Thursday, Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery told AZCentral the Temple ""was no more a church than Cuba is Fantasy Island.""He added: ""Accepting money for sex is against the law.""Elise was shaken after the jury verdict, according to the Phoenix New Times.“Your honor, I obviously didn’t expect this,” she said to Judge Sherry K. Stephens after the jury was led out of the courtroom. “This was a complex case, and there were many things the jury didn’t get to hear or see.”Elise is due to be sentenced April 8. She faces up to 70 years behind bars, according to the New York Daily News.After her conviction, Elise vowed on Facebook to continue appealing the verdict on grounds of religious freedom."
34,POLITICS,Marco Rubio Not Sorry For Bringing Dick Jokes Into Presidential Race,Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marco-rubio-donald-trump-penis-size_us_56d989c1e4b0000de40428d4,"If Donald Trump can be offensive and crude, why can't he?",2016-03-04,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio shows off his hands, suggesting something about the size of his jewels.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_6_2850_1754%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) said Friday that he's not sorry he's made political editors and reporters across the country have to write about the size of Donald Trump's dick.For all the insults that Trump has brought into the presidential race, it was Rubio who last week commented on the GOP front-runner's hands being small -- and hinted it meant he had small junk, too. Trump opened Thursday night's Republican debate by guaranteeing there's ""no problem"" down there.In an interview on NBC's ""Today"" show, the Florida senator said he didn't feel bad about introducing penis jokes into the presidential race. ""Oh, no. Please,"" Rubio said. ""I mean, Donald Trump has now spent a year doing this on a regular basis. In fact, there was not a speech or debate that Donald Trump does that he doesn't personally offend or try to offend somebody.""Besides, he said, he only made the comment ""one time, to a guy who needs to be stood up to."" And because it was in response to another attack from Trump, it was fair to defend himself. It's just the latest example of GOP candidates behaving like immature middle school boys. Rubio has suggested that Trump requested a full-length mirror ahead of a debate to make sure ""his pants weren't wet,"" and that Trump doesn't sweat because his ""pores are clogged from the spray tan."" Trump has called Rubio ""little Marco"" several times, and at one point imitated him desperately drinking a bottle of water. "
35,POLITICS,Daily Kos Asks Clinton And Sanders Supporters For Unity,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/daily-kos-democrats-general-election_us_56da0eebe4b0000de404c3af,A new policy at the top liberal site signals a pivot to the general election season.,2016-03-04,"Markos ""Kos"" Moulitsas, founder of Daily Kos, announced on Friday that personal attacks against the eventual Democratic nominee will not be tolerated.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56da10591e0000950070f522.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton may still be duking it out on the campaign trail, but at least one major progressive blog and activism site is already preparing for the general election.Markos “Kos” Moulitsas, founder of the Daily Kos, a popular liberal web site, wrote a blogpost on Friday asking the site’s community of writers, readers and commenters to begin moderating their criticism of Clinton starting on March 15, in the likely event that Clinton solidifies her hold on the nomination with additional primary wins.If Sanders does not turn the tide, Moulitsas wrote, “then on March 15 this site officially transitions to General Election footing. That means, we will focus our attention not just on Donald Trump or his rivals, but also on the Senate, the House, and state-level races.” “If you want the most liberal government possible, we aren’t going to get that this cycle in the White House, but we can keep building the bench down the ballot so that come 2024, we have lots of great liberals to choose from,” Moulitsas added.Moulitsas went on to lay out specific guidelines for talking about Clinton if she becomes the nominee. He distinguishes, for example, between “constructive criticism” of Clinton from a progressive perspective, and using “right-wing tropes” to attack her. He even prohibits liberal-themed name calling, like saying “she’s a sell-out corporatist whore oligarch.”Writers and commenters who violate the rules will make themselves eligible to be banned from the site.Moulitsas also notes that progressives should unify to accomplish much-needed process reforms like ending Iowa and New Hampshire’s outsize role in the primary season, abolishing the caucus system and ending the practice of having “super delegates,” who are not bound to support the candidate who wins a primary state.He even argued that there is a progressive consensus for ousting Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz (Fla.) as head of the Democratic National Committee.Moulitsas’ essay announcing the new policy is notable because it marks a turning point in a Democratic primary season that has pitted progressives supporting Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders against one another. The tension between Sanders and Clinton supporters has sometimes devolved into petty name calling, with Clinton backers accusing Sanders supporters of engaging in sexism. It is an allegation that gave birth to the infamous “Bernie Bros” stereotype -- and prompted Sanders himself to condemn it.Meanwhile, Sanders supporters have charged Clinton backers with using accusations of sexism to dismiss legitimate criticism of the former secretary of state.The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, an online progressive activism group that has not endorsed a presidential candidate, sounded a similar note as Super Tuesday results came in showing big wins for Clinton, all but claiming Sanders’ bid had ended.""Hillary Clinton was made a better candidate thanks to Bernie Sanders engaging her in a race to the top on popular economic populism issues like debt-free college, expanding Social Security, and jailing Wall Street bankers who break the law,” said Adam Green, PCCC’s co-founder, in a statement. “Had she run away from Elizabeth Warren-style ideas instead of working to ride an economic populist tide, many Super Tuesday results likely would have been different.”""The primary continues -- but no matter who wins, the Democratic Party has begun to be fundamentally remolded in Elizabeth Warren’s image,” Green added in the statement. “Armed with popular economic populist themes, Democrats are better positioned to win in November."""
