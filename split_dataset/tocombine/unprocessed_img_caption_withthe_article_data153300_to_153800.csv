Many of her best tweets are inspired by her three children, who usually don't realize how funny they are (""I refuse to correct my 4 year old when she calls Nicki Minaj, 'Nicki Massage' ""), but make a strong case for the notion that a sense of humor is an inherited trait (""Got angry at 4 year old for not getting ready for bed, and she said, 'This is why you don't have kids.' ""). Judd Apatows of the world, take note: Oxford and her progeny may fast be becoming the funniest family online.  For all of these reasons, Vogue thought Oxford would be the perfect person to approach for advice on planning a summer vacation with children. After all, her second-funniest source of those golden tweets is arguably her time spent in airports. See: ""I'm not concerned with babies on airplanes, but grown adults who don't fly often need their own terminal."" And: ""Just fell over trying to put my shoes on in security line at airport; in case you were wondering who's raising the next generation."" We asked her for her best tips for surviving the journey from home to vacation, and, just like her book, Everything Is Perfect When You're a Liar (Harper Collins), Oxford's guidelines are at once candid and remarkably heartfelt.

But my kids are good in restaurants and understand that that's a public place. When I explain that they have to treat the plane like a restaurant, they get it. But at the same time, as a parent you shouldn't take crap from other people on the plane. Unless you're in business class, where it might be inappropriate to bring three children, this is not a private plane. If they're extremely sensitive, they should know to bring noise-canceling headphones.""  Don't let your kids tell you what they want to bring along. ""You can't leave it that open. Just like with dinner, I only present a couple of choices because without fail, kids will always request every single thing that you don't have. Don't let your kids bring any item that can easily be destroyed, because it will be, and they're going to blame you for it. No matter how many times you warn them, it will still be all your fault. Also keep in mind anything they bring along that isn't packed: You are going to have to carry it at some point, so make sure you want to be seen carrying it.""  Do maintain a no-hands policy in public restrooms. ""From the time they were little, I taught my kids to keep their hands on their body when they're in a public restroom. They cross their hands on their chest and keep them there--I trained them well. I touch everything for them. Everything. They look like crazy people, but on some level I think they like it because I do all the work and they get to be lazy.""See more: 10 Best Beauty Secrets and TipsDon't leave your headphones at home. ""I've found my kids won't use the ones you can buy on planes. They don't fit them as well, and it's better to use ones that they're used to so that they don't get uncomfortable, take them out, and start harassing people. I bought some affordable Marc Jacobs ear buds--black for Henry and pink for the girls--that were comfortable and kid-friendly.""  Do take the kids to the beach. ""Hands down, the beach is the best place to take your kids. If you're somewhere like the Bahamas where the water is shallow and the currents aren't unsafe, then all you need are some beach toys and they are totally set for the entire day. But make sure you bring tons of water. Not just for hydration, but because kids are constantly getting sand in their eyes. I always use at least two bottles on the beach just pouring it onto their faces.""  Do savor family time. ""Go out with your kids even when you don't want to. Even when you're like, 'Oh my god, the kids are insane, we shouldn't go out,' those are the times when it's actually the best thing to do. Go to the museum, go somewhere you don't even want to go--you usually find by the end you're having a lot of fun.""

The realization that I could choose to redefine my divorce was powerful; it gave me the motivation and momentum to continue.,2013-05-30,"Woman adjusting wedding ring, mid section (focus on hands)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d354026000035007fc731.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Marriage is not a test. I lived. I loved. I lost. But I didn't fail.Society makes assumptions about those who are divorced. Maybe we lack the fortitude to persist through difficulties. Perhaps we possess some great fatal flaw that makes us unable to sustain matrimony. Or, possibility we are flighty, given to jump in without thought and give up just as easily. There is often shame inherent in admitting that one is divorced, like some scarlet letter ""D"" is forever branded upon your character if your ""ever after"" ended sooner than expected. It's as though you failed at one of the biggest assessments you face as an adult.In the strictest sense, my marriage did fail. After all, it ceased to exist upon the receipt of the horrific text: ""I'm sorry to be such a coward leaving you this way but I'm leaving you and leaving the state."" Furthermore, my husband failed me through his betrayal and abandonment. I failed him by not seeing that he needed help and I failed myself by not being aware of his actions and the signs of a crumbling marriage. Yet, even with all that defeat, I refuse to look at my marriage as a failure. That label undermines our years together with all its shared memories and joys; the shared life and experiences are negated with that single word. Although I did feel as though I failed in some ways, I was adamant that I was not going to let my divorce define me as a failure. Failure is an act, not a person. I'm divorced. Not defective. As I grappled with the end of my marriage, I found comfort in the words of others. Others who had faced their own challenges and were determined to learn from and grow from their mistakes and unrealized goals.There's always failure. And there's always disappointment. And there's always loss. But the secret is learning from the loss, and realizing that none of those holes are vacuums. Michael J. FoxWhen the marriage died, I felt like I expired right along with it. As though my respirator had been yanked from my face and I was struggling to find the strength and will to breathe on my own. I felt unanchored and unable to escape from the pull of the dying marriage. Failures are not vacuums; we can summon the strength to move beyond them. The realization that I could choose to redefine my divorce was powerful; it gave me the motivation and momentum to continue. I've come to believe that all my past failure and frustration were actually laying the foundation for the understandings that have created the new level of living I now enjoy. Tony Robbins I am often asked if I would have married him if I could turn back the years. I would. Yes, the divorce and associated suffering have been the most painful experience of my life. Yet, I could not imagine my life without having endured that pain. Without that failure, I would not have the perspective that allows so much gratitude and acceptance in my life today. Acceptance that extends to forgiveness for my ex and myself for the conditions that led to the end of the marriage.It is impossible to live without failing at something, unless you live so cautiously that you might as well not have lived at all, in which case you have failed by default. J. K. Rowling I used to be too fear adverse in my old life; I would engage it what I call ""practicing the perfect,"" which is a way to feed the ego at the expense of the soul. I would try things only if I believed that I had a good chance of success. Interestingly, the cataclysmic end of the marriage released me from that fear of failing. I learned that it's rarely fatal and that security is only an illusion. You'll never know what you can do unless you try.A failure is not always a mistake, it may simply be the best one can do under the circumstances. The real mistake is to stop trying. B. F. Skinner  The tendency is to respond to failure in one of two ways -- blame others or internalize the mistake. That's the ego talking again. It's helpful to realize that most people in most situations are doing the best they can. I used this to help soften towards my ex. I realized that he didn't do these things to me; I was simply collateral damage in his decisions. I also let up on the self-flagellation for not recognizing any red flags. Success is not a good teacher, failure makes you humble. Shahrukh KhanOur egos are a bit like young meatheads in a gym. Flexing in the mirror, wanting to appear strong and capable amongst the others. This means that sometimes we will try to lift more than we can without asking for assistance. And, just like in the weight room, this can only lead to disaster. When we fail at something, we can either give up or ask for help. Allow yourself to be humble, ask for a spotter and you'll not only gain the respect of those around you, but you will also be able to lift more than you ever thought possible.I don't believe in failure. It is not failure if you enjoyed the process. Oprah Winfrey My biggest issue with labeling my marriage as a failure is that it focuses on the end and ignores the 16 years together. The 16 good years. Those still count. I still think back and smile. I may not love the man but I still love the memories. I think this thought is especially poignant for those with children from the union. It's important for the kids not to think that you see the marriage that created them as a waste, a mistake. In some way and for some amount of time, it was successful.Failure should be our teacher, not our undertaker. Failure is delay, not defeat. It is a temporary detour, not a dead end. Denis WaitleyDivorce is a powerful teacher if you listen to its lessons. Its methods may be harsh but its messages are life changing. A failed marriage does not make you a failure. The only true failure is failing to live and love, even if that means that sometimes you may lose.

She could be having home security issues or simply be extremely nervous. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d33dd3c00005b000a0dff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Terri Trespicio for meQuilibriumI've lived too much of my life in reaction to fear: Fear of being hurt, of being embarrassed, of not being good enough. It has kept me from being as strong as I could be. It's contributed to a life riddled with anxiety and straitjacketed by stress.So I've attempted to manage those fears by doing things you've probably tried yourself: asserting control, being ""good,"" being liked, being right; inflicted worrisome thoughts as a way of inoculating myself against ""real"" danger. Ha! Like that worked. It just made me more miserable.You've heard of the stress hormone cortisol, right? Well when I went to an integrative physician here in Manhattan a while back, he ran a raft of tests and told me I was, in layman's terms, ""out"" of cortisol. He described my nervous system as a sponge that's been squeezed too many times; there's nothing left to wring out of it. That's bad.Managing fear is a losing proposition. It's like trying to wrestle an alligator to the ground. It requires that you treat fear as real and then try to stop it from doing what it's designed to do -- overwhelm and terrify you. No amount of good behavior or tyrannical attempts to control it will help.It's taken years -- therapy, yoga, reading, thinking, observing, and yes, some medical intervention and even dietary changes, to recognize that I was coming at this the wrong way. That to have even the hope of overcoming anxiety and the magnitude of stresses it spawns, I can't defend myself against fear, but embrace it. To know that at its worst, it can't do the damage that I can and have done to myself.""Tackling fear and anxiety or sadness and depression can, at best, ratchet our lives from the negatives to zero,"" explains Andrew Shatte, PhD, author of The Resilience Factor and the Chief Science Officer at meQuilibrium. ""We need to build the positive -- optimism, hope, good emotions, and meaning and purpose -- to dial our lives into the positive, which, lets face it, is where we all want to be.""Here are some of the strategies I've learned that help me filter out some of the automatic, habitually ingrained fear-based thinking and reduce stress in my own life:Keep an eye out for iceberg beliefs. You and I have some deep-set ideas about ourselves and how the world works that aren't necessarily correct, but they control what we do without our even realizing it. We call these ""iceberg beliefs"" and being aware of them is the first step. For me, it's this idea that if I'm not doing everything, I'm failing. It's nonsense, and I know it, but I realize that it's the itch behind my discomfort. (Read more about icebergs.)Sit still. I don't mean physically, because in fact movement helps me process ideas and metabolize my stress. But mentally, I need my brain to sit still more than it does. My own meditation practice admittedly goes in fits and starts. But whenever I spend even just 10 minutes focusing on my breath, I emerge from it decidedly more calm, always thinking, Why don't I do that more often?!Reach out. One of the inherent risks of attempting to ""manage"" fear and stress is that it causes you to become more internally than externally focused. You know that downward spiral as well as I do. So don't give in to it -- reach out. I call my sister, my mother, a friend, someone who's going through a harder time than me. I send a loving note to someone who least expects it. It makes me feel stronger, more capable, more open. And there's a beautiful boomerang effect: You send some loving, positive energy out into the world, and it comes speeding back to you, just when you need it most.Terri Trespicio is the editor of meQuilibrium, the first-ever online stress management program.
