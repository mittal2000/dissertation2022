It contains only 3.75 micrograms of the inactivated H5N1 antigen, or protein, compared with 90 micrograms in an already licensed vaccine made by French drugmaker Sanofi.With such a tiny amount of needed antigen, Friedland said Glaxo could easily make ""far more doses"" of the vaccine than it otherwise could.A special adjuvant boosts the effectiveness of the Glaxo vaccine, Friedland said, allowing for less antigen.""It's the adjuvant that makes the difference,"" he said.(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Dan Grebler)"

The transition has been smooth and delightful: He's well-behaved though very active in the daily routine; he has made friends very quickly and has been to play dates at friends' homes as well as our home. Most of all, he's happy and content. The challenges have been few and far in between and were easily solved by his wise kindergarten teacher with the help of warm, loving and small staff. We just celebrated Tal's birthday in a big party with another girl from his class, and it was a very loud, happy occasion. What I would really like to tell you about is not my son's progress, but of the lessons I've learned from his experience, as well as mine.Coming from special education, where the groups are tiny -- six or eight children compared to 30-35 in regular education -- I had to adapt quickly to a world that seemed like a parallel universe. Where other parents just drop off their children outside the door or come and stay just to make sure their kid isn't crying, I stayed in a bit longer and observed so I could learn. I wanted to learn how my son reacts to other children; where he misses cues and signals; who could be a potential friend and how to explain to him that certain behaviors are unwanted -- because he tends to imitate other children and sometimes gets carried away with excitement. I watched, and learned a lesson I couldn't have learned before: that not all ""normal"" children are ""normal."" There are so many variations in behavior, in self-regulation, in sensory profiles, that the spectrum outside of the autistic spectrum is a wide open ocean. At the age of 5, children are complex human beings, micro-cosmos of almost everything we encounter in human society.What is so interesting about this, you might ask? Well, if you spend years with special educators and therapists, you keep hearing from them how your child's every aspect fits the model of special needs. You keep seeing your child through this prism of challenges and difficulties. Though I knew this all along, the lesson really hit home recently. Our kids might have special needs and challenges, but not all challenges are related to their special condition. Kids, in general, do not fit an optimal mold. There are emotional difficulties -- like overcoming frustrations and delaying instant gratification; there are sensory issues, like perfectly ""normal"" children who can't bear noise or chew on their sleeves until they reach their knees; and there things like alarming temper tantrums, biting and other disruptive behavior.A seemingly surprising conclusion I came to over a year ago has now been cast in a much stronger light: In many ways the extra care, coaching and therapy help our special children overcome obstacles that other children just don't get the tools and training to handle. Years of emotional, occupational and play therapy gave my son the means and implements that I see him use on a daily basis. He can often accurately grasp and identify with what other children are going through when they're in distress and sometimes, I see him reach out with his ""tool kit"" and try to help them.I'm not naïve; I know that with autistic children, the problems can be pervasive, multi-faceted and multi-layered. I've recently written how happy we are when our children display ""bad"" but normative behavior, like lying or dissing girls at a certain age. But it's really important to know, especially when you're at the early years after your child had been diagnosed, that not everything should be attributed to ""the condition."" First and foremost, they are children. I truly believe that, and maybe that is the reason why Tal's integration has gone so well, despite the fact that I had been told just months before that his integration would fail, that the ""real"" world would be too frustrating and scary for him to fit in."

(Photo by Peter Michael Dills/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c83d42000003100fd99c2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a wedding gown designer, I am frequently asked, ""What are the latest trends in bridal?"", and I honestly just don't get it. This is not the hottest club or latest gallery opening you are going to, this is your wedding!!! As anyone who follows my work knows, I have a sincere devotion to all things vintage and a unique approach to dressing the bride. Some have called me ""non-traditional"" perhaps because I don't restrict the idea of what a wedding gown can be to the ubiquitous ball gown.In my mind, part of what makes a wedding a wedding, is the sense of history and family that are celebrated on this day. It is, of course, about the lovely couple (and yes, the dress!), but it's also about tradition in whatever way that is significant for you, and your grandparents, and your annoying cousin, and the foods you love, and the prayers or poems you choose to recite. A wedding is beyond trends: it's the opposite of trends. It is meaningful, and genuine, and one day that symbolizes something that is supposed to LAST. Not for a day, or a season, or until the next big thing comes along, but for your LIFETIME! The thing about trends is they don't become completely apparent until a few years or even a decade or more has passed when we have the distance to clearly see the pattern. A few years ago, colored sashes became all the rage and still pop up on many a wedding gown. It is a fairly risk-free way to introduce color to the bride's dress. But because it became such a trend, we saw it in virtually every designer's collection for a few seasons. While there is nothing wrong with a pretty sash, do keep in mind this will probably date your wedding circa early 2000s years from now.We are all products of the time in which we live. Just like those of us who grew up wearing low rise jeans feel funny in a high waist, the fashions that we are exposed to in our lives do shape what we find attractive. So, if pink dresses, sleeves, vintage, rustic, lace, peplums, illusion necklines or metallics feel oh so ""you"" then go for it! If something really resonates deeply, odds are you will love it (or at least remember fondly why you loved it) 20 or 30 years from now. I just think it's a little crazy to choose something for what is supposed to be an enduring symbol of your union JUST because it happens to be in fashion that particular season.So how do you avoid falling victim to wedding trends? You probably can't, but here's a tip when it comes to the dress: be true to yourself. Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy certainly re-defined what a wedding gown could be, and perhaps started the shift towards a simple silhouette, yet when I look at those photos, they don't look dated at all. She looks classic, iconic, and most importantly, genuinely joyful and confident. I kind of have the opposite feeling when looking back at Princess Diana. You definitely think ""1980s"" when you see her wedding pictures, and she looks overwhelmed by the volume and excess that was so emblematic of that decade. In retrospect, we all know she WAS overwhelmed and in many ways a victim of the time in which she lived and the role she was about to take on. The latest royal, lovely Kate, chose a dress that fit the majesty of the occasion, but also suited her personally. As a designer, I would have loved to see her choose something a bit more original, but at the same time, her gown was so fitting on every level.For today's ""non-princess"" brides, one recent trend I fully support is the move towards individuality. I'm thrilled that more and more brides are confident in their personal style, and resisting the pressure to fit into a particular ""bridal"" mold. We are seeing alternatives to strapless meringue and even (gasp!) color in wedding gowns. But really, it's not about a sleeve or a sash or a vineyard or a ballroom. Does this wedding come from the heart? Does it tell the story of you as a couple? Does it celebrate the unique blend of the two of you?When considering a wedding gown, my advice is to choose something that moves you, that makes you feel happy and your most beautiful, that you know will melt your soon-to-be spouse's heart. Choose a gown that you will look back 20 years from now and think, 'Wow, look how young we were' (even if you aren't that young, 20 years from now, trust me, you'll revise that opinion!). You will look back and see how in love you were, and if you pay more attention to choosing the right partner than obsessing over silhouettes and table settings, hopefully you still will be! Antique lace, sleeves, illusion backs and floral embellishments...these are all things that stir my soul, and maybe they are, or will be trends. When I design a collection, so many things inspire me...the latest bridal trends? I say, start your own."

The city is still buzzing, and the food and drink scene has never been better. I have teamed up with the awesome Barchick ladies to bring you a definitive A-Z guide of eating and drinking in the capitol -- Mighty Spice vs. Barchick. I do the food, and they do the booze. Enjoy. This week we are looking at what is hot right now A-E...A is for Antipodeans: Our Australian and Kiwi friends have brought café cool to London. They are doing the best coffee in town, and their laidback style of eating has made brunch worth brunching. Organic ham hock, chorizo and roast pepper, baked beans with spinach chili cornbread and a poached egg at Salvation Jane is my favorite. All Nighters: London is no New York when it comes to late-night hangouts, but we're getting better. Whether it's eating meat on the 40th floor at Duck & Waffle or late-night eggs benedict and champagne at Vingt Quatre -- no rest for the wicked. B is for Basements: We all love a bit of basement dining, and nothing comes close to the basement below one very garish, neon-lit sex shop in Soho. It is home to La Bodega Negra, our finest Mexican restaurant. Enter with confidence and dine in style!Blue Blazer: This drink can be dangerous to make, so don't try it at home. Flaming whisky is poured back and forth between two silver cups forming a long blue arc of flame. The Artesian Bar serves it over hot lava stones with crystalized sugar sticks. Show offs!C is for Chili: Chili peppers are my favorite ingredient, and I love eating anything that makes them shine. You can't beat a chili pizza, and the Charlie Jones from Story Deli in Shoreditch is the best. Spicy sausage, taleggio cheese, roasted red peppers, toasted spices, birds eye chillies and lots of sweet chili sauce -- yeah mama!Cellar Door: It used to be an underground loo, now it's a bar and the ultimate hidden gem. If you're looking for good cocktails, drag queens and some good old-fashioned snuff (there's a whole menu of the stuff), then look no further. Seeing is believing down here. Oh, and make sure you lock the toilet door or you're gonna give people quite a show.D is for Dead Hippy: Rock and roll burger joint Meat Liqour has perfected the art of posh fast food. Their ""Dead Hippy"" burger is a thing of beauty -- two succulent beef patties, oozing cheese, pickles and awesome homemade sauce. They don't take bookings, so bring a coat and get there early. Detective Agency: Evans and Peel -- Book an appointment, and have your story ready, on arrival the detective grills you (he's good). If you make the cut, he will swing open the bookcase to reveal an underground den of smoked food and cocktails. Hurry, before it gets raided.E is for Egg: The humble egg has been given a mega facelift by Dabbous, one of the best restaurants in the world right now! They take a free-range hen egg and mix it with smoked butter and wild mushrooms to produce something truly ethereal. It's also served in a bird's nest -- nice touch guys.Enter Through a Smeg Fridge: Casually stroll into the breakfast club and announce, ""I'm here to see the mayor."" This will gain you access through the fridge... and into one of the coolest bars this city has to offer, The Mayor of Scaredy Cat Town. With dark corners, great cocktails and American food, this is a great hidden hangout.Don't miss F-J next week.If you want to see more from those lovely Barchick ladies check out their site http://barchick.com"

In the beauty world, ""natural"" never really means ""natural"" -- the same amount of prep and primp goes into creating these modern looks. But with a little know-how you can pull off this smart and understated style on your Big Day. Here are some tricks and tips:  Brow Bone Beauty We have all seen brides walk down the aisle with sparkling brow bones. A much more current approach is a champagne washed eye lid, luscious lashes and a matte pink tone under the brow. Pink has many benefits; a bit of flush helps to make skin look radiant (let's be honest, a healthy complexion is the basis of all beauty), and it incorporates a feminine feel. A matte brow bone represents a manicured and savvy bride who has the sense to eschew an over-the-top approach to bridal beauty .  Bag the Blush Too much blush looks overdone. Opt for a ""glow"" rather then a ""hue"" on the apples of the cheeks. Bringing light to the skin gives it radiance and charm rather then a faux flush (which should come naturally). If you feel that you look washed out without a pop of color on the cheek, add a little bronzer which will perk the skin right up. Here is my pick for cheeks.  The ""Un-do"" I have noticed the ever-so-classic chignon has drifted from the side of the head to the center. This takes away any need for a part and, as a more modern approach, allows hairstylists to push the hair back right into the chignon. The trick is to make sure the hair pushed back is somewhere between sleek and in total disarray. The skill is in finding a happy medium to make this look distinctive. The actual bun? It resembles a cluster of cotton candy -- whipped to perfection.  Hair Appliqué Tastefully adorned hair can add unexpected sparkle and dress up any look without applying too much effort. The good news is that tiaras are out of style, and much more palatable creations grace the crowns of the chicest brides. There is quite a variety to choose from, and some resemble a piece of art and can even act as an heirloom. (We have overheard a few of our brides discussing hair ornaments as a gift for their bridesmaids. How genius!) My top picks are from Gabriella New York , and the Merci New York Boutique for Newlywish.  The New Nail The textured nail is not to be misjudged. It comes in many varieties and although the ""caviar"" nail may not be suited for a bride, the ""velvet"" nail is a feathery take on the classics. The velvet nail is a whimsical way to add something a little edgy but maintains a soft and angelic feel. My favorite? Ciaté in Mink Cashmere."
5,DIVORCE,It's Not Fraud If You're Married,"Lisa Arends, Contributor
Author, wellness coach, and math teacher",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/its-not-fraud-if-youre-ma_us_5b9c80ece4b03a1dcc7f3fa7,It became clear that my ex-husband had been deceptively spending large amounts of money and that his financial house of cards was in the process of crashing down.,2012-11-13,A man holding a notebook under his arm and leaving,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c80ec2000002d00fd9887.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""It's not fraud if you're married,"" the policeman said apologetically. As I registered his words, the enormity of what I was facing became clear. My ex-husband and I first established a household together in our late teens. We came together with nothing. We opened up joint accounts and scrupulously managed every dime that came in from our low paying jobs. In those early years, we did all of the finances together, talking through options and discussing goals. Our income ebbed and flowed but as I completed college and he gained skill and notoriety, our salaries climbed to comfortable levels in our twenties. We also grew to trust each other. We had similar patterns in spending and saving and compatible beliefs about money. As his work picked up and his hours grew longer, I took over the responsibility for managing the household finances. Years later, when I started graduate school on top of my full time job and he began working from home, he became what we jokingly called The Minister of Finance. I only found out after he left me that he took advantage of this role and my trust; the minister was a marital embezzler. As we reached our early thirties, I thought we were in great shape. Our income was more than enough to pay our bills, we had finally saved for the deck we had always dreamed of, and our retirement accounts were growing. It turned out, however, that the marital accounts were being carefully and deliberately drained from the inside. I discovered that he had been withdrawing large sums of money for years while manipulating the accounts to keep his actions hidden. The numbers I had been told and even some of the documents I had been shown were fakes. His computer and cell phone, which I always had access to, were decoys meant to keep me unsuspecting and unaware that there was anything hidden behind the checkbook. Forgeries were carried out in the supposed sanctuary of the marital home. The day after he left, I wormed my way into the password-protected accounts. My first thought was that I had nothing, as the checking and savings accounts were dry. I then realized that I had less than nothing when I saw the debt accumulated and carefully squirreled away. I looked around at the house that he abandoned along with me, the house that I could not afford to live in on my own (not that I wanted to). While I was navigating the serpentine accounts and trying to trace the movement of the funds, a knock on the door brought an additional surprise: a certified letter from the IRS demanding money from an audit. An audit I knew nothing about.It became clear that my ex-husband had been deceptively spending large amounts of money and that his financial house of cards was in the process of crashing down. He jumped out of his life just as the fiscal conflagration occurred, leaving me alone in the fire. At first, I was hopeful that I could find protection through the courts. After all, he had lied, forged, and then disappeared. This had to be fraud. But it's not fraud if you're married.I was left with empty accounts. Debts I have to pay that were used to fund his other life. He asked for and received the house in the divorce, yet failed to refinance and remove my name or make the payments. I was in a catch-22; I owed money on a house that was not legally mine to occupy or sell. He neglected to pay the court costs, insurance payments and taxes that were ordered in the decree. I learned that civil courts are ill-prepared to deal with a criminal and that the law-abiding spouse gets saddled with the mess. Why is it that Bernie Madoff gets sentenced to 150 years in prison while my husband simply gets a non-enforceable piece of paper that asks him to pay back the misappropriated funds? Oh, that's right: it's not fraud if you're married.The financial mess is a bungee cord that tethers me to the pain of the divorce. It's difficult to move forward when I am still literally paying for the past. It's even harder emotionally when I let myself wallow in the anger and frustration at the unfairness of it all. I work every day to wrap this frustration in gratitude. I am thankful to the IRS, who granted me innocent spouse relief, absolving me of the back taxes incurred through his lies. I have an education and a career that allows me to whittle away at the debts. My friends provided a home for me when I couldn't afford one and my family seeded my accounts until my paychecks could accrue. I am especially grateful for the new life I have now, with eyes wide open and auto pilot turned off.I am also thankful for the lessons I have learned. I've come to realize that there is a difference between trust and complacency. I seek evidence to back up claims and I don't take someone's word quite so easily anymore. I have put fraud alert on my life. Additionally, I learned how strong I can be. I had two fears in life: losing my husband and losing my financial security. Three years ago, I faced them both and lived to tell the tale. I'm just looking forward to the day when I am no longer paying for those lessons."

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported more than 420 cases of meningitis and the death toll now stands at 32 and rising. Federal investigators have linked the meningitis cases to contaminated vials of steroid drugs made by the New England Compounding Center in Massachusetts. Even worse, the CDC now says that some meningitis patients have now come down with risky secondary infections that are proving difficult to treat.A recent op-ed I authored last month along with drug safety expert Sarah L. Sellers argues that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must be given greater regulatory authority over compounding pharmacies like the one at the center of this investigation.  That piece, which was published by the McClatchy national news service and newspapers across the country, says: ""The time has come to rein in an industry that has flourished in recent years, selling not only substandard drugs and tainted medicines but also unapproved substances that represent little more than a modern day equivalent to snake oil.""Why do I believe that we must take steps now to closely regulate this industry at the federal level?  Compounding pharmacies have grown in recent years and often operate as factories -- mixing up and shipping out large amounts of drug across state lines. Traditionally they made small batches of tailor-made medicine and thus typically were scrutinized by state pharmacy boards. But without a mandate to meet FDA safe manufacturing standards, they can cut corners. And in fact, that is just what happened in this case, a problem that had tragic results for many families across the country.The New England Compounding Center made up batches of a steroid drug used to treat back and joint pain, but did so under unsanitary conditions. In fact, inspections by health officials found visible signs of mold, unsterile conditions and standing water at the facility -- which has been shut down since the outbreak came to light.Instead of producing small amounts of drug for individual patients, this company acted like a large drug firm, but still was able to evade FDA standards. In the end, health officials say that contaminated vials of this injectable pain medication reached an estimated 14,000 patients in 23 states.Furthermore, this isn't the first such outbreak. Federal health officials have fingered compounding pharmacies in cases that go back more than a decade and involve drugs that are injected into a variety of body areas including the spinal cord, bloodstream and eye. Those tainted drugs have caused outbreaks of illness, loss of vision and deaths -- yet they are quickly forgotten until the next outbreak occurs.If we do nothing to close the loophole that allows large-scale compounding pharmacies to escape scrutiny by the FDA, such cases will continue to occur. But lawmakers investigating the outbreak this week in Washington can do more than just listen to testimony: They must move now to strengthen the FDA's ability to regulate compounding pharmacies.Congress should ask the FDA to establish national standards for compounding pharmacies. And compounding pharmacies that cannot meet safety standards might need to be stopped completely. In addition, states need to be actively involved as strong partners in the oversight of this industry.And just like big drug companies, compounding pharmacies must start reporting adverse events to state and federal authorities. Without such a requirement, a pharmacy that makes up a bad batch of drug can potentially sicken many patients before a cluster is identified and the outbreak comes under investigation.Drugs made by compounding pharmacies must be clearly labeled so that physicians and patients know they are buying such products -- and can discuss the risks and benefits. Finally, compounding pharmacies must be held responsible for the quality of their products.I can't even imagine the nightmare this episode has been for the victims and their families. Americans need the government to act and Congress must start crafting solutions today to protect the public from this threat.For more by Lynn R.

TJX's 26.9% interest charges are based on the average daily balance of the billing month, so the balance we owed before the bill was paid was included -- we owed a penny but we were charged interest on an average monthly balance which, including that penny, came to $591.38! Confronted with our outrage at being charged a de facto 119,100% interest rate on an unpaid balance of one penny, she waived the $11.91 interest fee. This fiasco led us to take another look at the $25 late fee we had paid. One more phone call revealed that while TJX's billing period is 31 days -- we had paid the bill over the phone within 30 days -- their billing cycle is 23 days. If payment is not received within 23 days of the purchase a late fee is charged. The agent readily admitted that many customers found this discrepancy confusing and got charged a $25 late fee.We had the time and energy to investigate rather than pay just to get TJX off our backs. But the stores -- TJ Maxx, Marshall's, and Home Goods -- offering the TJX cards attract many working class people, who between long hours at work and raising children have little time or energy to spend arguing with TJX. No doubt many immigrants whose English is minimal also use the card. We paid $25, got the interest and our penny waived, and threw out the card. We can only imagine the Kafkaesque credit card web that those customers who can the least afford it, must get caught in -- by TJX and many other credit card companies.Two years after the implementation of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, not much has changed.In a 2010 issue of the Herald Tribune, business columnist Ernest Werlin, a former Wall Street senior executive, brings together comments from several members of congress that help us understand why this is so: The bill's Senate sponsor, Chris Dodd (D-CT), blamed bank lobbyists for weakening its provisions. Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders pointed out that the financial services industry has five lobbyists for every member of Congress. Illinois Senator Dick Durbin told a Chicago radio station that the banking industry ""frankly owns the place.""Senator elect and staunch consumer advocate Elizabeth Warren could not have been more right when she pointed out that there are ""a lot of tricks and traps in those [credit card] contracts."" She has the intestinal fortitude to stand up to the banking industry and advocate the passage of meaningful reforms. Hopefully she will be able to influence her congressional colleagues to reject the lure of special interests and stand with her."
8,STYLE & BEAUTY,When Did My Husband Become More Stylish Than Me? (PHOTOS),"Biba Milioto, Contributor
Fashion Writer, PR consultant",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reinvent-style_us_5b9c80bfe4b03a1dcc7f3d6b,"While my personal style was devolving, my husband's was reaching new, luxurious heights.",2012-11-13,"Before Baby: Cute hair, great accessories and stripes",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c80bf2000004e00fd9879.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"I think most moms would agree that their first year as a parent wasn't exactly sartorially stellar. With the needs of a baby being your first priority, you often find yourself amazed that you've managed to get dressed at all, never mind that you're wearing the same sweatshirt and leggings for the fourth (fifth?) day in a row, and you haven't washed your hair in a week. After my daughter was born last January, I continued to dress as if I was pregnant: think loose, roomy tops, sweats with elastic waists, and baggy coats that could easily snuggle her while I carried her around in a Baby Bjorn. Ironically, while my personal style was devolving, so to speak, my husband's was reaching new, luxurious heights. As a magazine editor who has recently crossed the aisle into the world of fashion glossies, his closet has seen an influx of a wealth of designer duds that would make any fashionista -- woman or man -- jealous: sleek wool suits from A.P.C, J. Lindeberg cashmere cardigans and more pairs of shoes than any man should admit to having. Frankly, it was all a bit much to take. Here I was looking (and feeling) sloppy, spending my days covered in milk and smashed avocado, while he left the house every morning looking like he stepped out of the pages of  GQ. For the record: I adore my husband. And I love that his sense of style is so right-on: He's the guy my friends' boyfriends call when they need advice on what to wear to their wedding, or where to find the perfect shirt/tie/fill-in-the-blank. But it seemed particularly cruel to have one's own spouse be the source of so much style angst. Even though he insisted that I looked great, and that he found me just as alluring in my mom-wear as he did in my pre-baby wardrobe (which was filled with silk blouses, pretty dresses and jeans that did not involve elastic panels), I couldn't help but wonder, as Carrie Bradshaw was so fond of saying, if this was a pivotal moment in my life. Was this a blip on the radar screen of my personal identity, or was it an indication that I was two steps away from mom jeans? Since I'd left my job at a women's fashion magazine to become a full-time freelance writer when my daughter was born, I had no real reason to get dressed in anything other than leisure wear every day. Days could pass where the only person I saw was the mailman and my next-door neighbor, so the motivation to take that extra step was hard to summon. But I knew somewhere deep inside that if I just pulled myself together, just a tiny bit, I'd feel more like myself, more like the stylish person I was before pregnancy ballooned me to epic roundness, before my husband's sense of style made me feel depressingly dowdy.I started by buying some stylish soft pants from the Gap, which I reasoned looked more chic then the dingy lycra leggings I'd been wearing, but were still ultra-comfy. Then I ordered a pair of fun leopard brogues, which were flat and comfortable, but totally on-trend. I remembered reading a story about some chic French stylist in Vogue who said that once she became a mom she developed a daily uniform that made dressing so much easier, as everything in her closet worked together, eliminating any guesswork. Smart, right? Since I was still nursing, I needed buttons for easy boob access, so I decided on some soft chambray shirts from J.Crew and Rag & Bone, which looked hipster-y and casual, but weren't too precious to wear around the baby. Since my husband is slim, I snuck a few of his shirts into the mix as well. Wearing my new look out one afternoon, a friend complimented me on how I always managed to look ""casual but stylish."" Success! I felt like maybe, just maybe, I was getting my swerve back. I also re-discovered the miraculous effects of a little bit of blush and concealer (bless you, Laura Mercier), and that a swipe of Chanel lipstick can instantly make you feel glamorous, even if you've only had four hours of sleep and your hair is matted with rice-cracker goop. All in all, the few small changes I made felt like they'd turned the tide a bit, which did wonders for my confidence. Are there still days when I backslide, and find myself cooking dinner in my pajamas? Yes. And I still feel a pang of jealousy every now and then about my husband's closet, and his days, which are far more glamorous than mine. But I feel vastly more like myself, both inside and out, than I did in those first fuzzy months of new motherhood. And when my daughter, now ten months old, smiles at me, or feeds me a big clump of cheddar cheese from her high chair, I can't help but think I'd take a lifetime of wearing mom jeans in exchange for her unbridled adoration. I just wouldn't let anyone take any pictures. Want more? Be sure to check out HuffPost Style on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr, Pinterest and Instagram at @HuffPostStyle."

The celebration is intended to remind observant Hindus of goods invariable triumph of good over evil and the concept of ""Atman,"" which is quite similar to the Christian idea of the soul. The visual metaphor used to express the holiday's buoyant optimism is the lamp, so Indian cities twinkle throughout the celebration.Though the holiday is celebrated well beyond India's border, not only in Bangladesh but also in places that have large Hindu populations like Guyana and the U.S., the celebration is probably best enjoyed in person in India's less commercial cities like Allahabad, where locals pour an amazing amount of effort into making the celebration memorable, dressing as gods and stringing up lanterns. Jaipur, in the Rajasthani desert, puts on a show with its lights as does Amritsar, where the Golden Temple is illuminated.All that said, if travelers aren't in India well before the holiday begins, getting anywhere can be extremely difficult as families tend to use the holiday to reconnect. This chaos makes Thanksgiving travel look like a picnic.It is perhaps best then to get a sense of the celebration with some photos."

But a new report dispels the accusation that digital devices will ruin your eyes by showing that people with some eye diseases can read more quickly and comfortably by using tablets like the iPad.""Reading is a simple pleasure that we often take for granted until vision loss makes it difficult,"" said Daniel Roth, M.D., an associate clinical professor at Robert Wood Johnson School of Medicine who led of the study. ""Our findings show that at a relatively low cost, digital tablets can improve the lives of people with vision loss and help them reconnect with the larger world.""More from Everyday Health: Pepsi With Fiber to Launch in Japan Paramedics Sparsely Administer Life-Saving Epinephrine What's the Difference Between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes?People with moderate vision loss could increase their reading speed by 15 words-per-minute, on average. A tablet with a back-lit screen resulted in the fastest reading speeds for all study participants, no matter what their vision.One hundred participants gained at least 42 words-per-minute (WPM) when using an iPad™ on the 18-point font setting, compared with reading a print book or newspaper. A more modest gain of 12 WPM, on average, was achieved by all subjects when using the Kindle™ tablet set to 18-point font. Patients with the poorest vision − defined as 20/40 or worse in both eyes− showed the most improvement in speed when using an iPad or Kindle, compared with print.The iPad's back-illuminated screen is the key to faster reading by patients with moderate vision loss, researchers said. Loss of contrast sensitivity -- being able see an object distinctly from its background and discern shades of gray -- is common in people with low vision. The improved contrast by a back-lit screen is huge for people with low vision. The original Kindle, which used in this study, does not have a back-lit screen.Interestingly, people with the worst vision found the iPad most comfortable, while those with the best vision preferred print. This information will be useful to ophthalmologists in advising patients with various degrees of vision loss.Eye diseases like macular degeneration or diabetic retinopathy can cause loss of central vision affecting millions of people. Before digital tablets came along, reading aids were limited to lighted magnifiers, which are cumbersome and inconvenient by comparison.The research was presented at the 116th annual American Academy of Ophthalmology meeting, jointly conducted this year with the Asia-Pacific Academy of Ophthalmology. The study was conducted at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey.""Digital Tablets Help Readers with Vision Loss"" first appeared on Everyday Health."
