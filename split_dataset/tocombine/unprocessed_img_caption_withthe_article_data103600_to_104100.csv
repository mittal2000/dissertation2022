On Saturday, Aug. 9, 2014, a white police officer fatally shot Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, in the St. Louis suburb. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e69d41f230000321ade4034.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In July 1967 President Lyndon B. Johnson formed the 11-member National Advisory Commission on Civil Disorders, better known as the Kerner Commission, to explain the riots that had plagued U.S. cities each summer since 1964 and provide recommendations for the future. The commission's 1968 report, known as the ""Kerner Report,"" concluded that the nation was ""moving toward two societies, one black, one white -- separate and unequal."" The commission warned that unless conditions were remedied, the country would face a ""system of 'apartheid'"" in its major cities.One of the major issues the commission examined was the conduct of police in African-American communities across the nation. Among its findings and recommendations, the commission concluded:The abrasive relationship between the police and the minor­ity communities has been a major -- and explosive -- source of grievance, tension and disorder. The blame must be shared by the total society.That was 1968. Is Ferguson, Missouri, the existential reality of America in 2014?When the St. Louis County grand jury, after deliberating over whether to indict Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of Michael Brown Jr., decided not to bring any charges against him, it was the spark that reignited the longstanding anger and simmering distrust of the system among African Americans in Ferguson and across the nation. Their ""cup of endurance"" had run over. The inconvenient truth is that many African Americans see that decision as further confirmation of their belief that nothing has changed since the Kerner Report of 1968, and that nothing will; a police officer who shoots and kills an unarmed black man will almost always be exonerated. The question of whether or not Officer Wilson could have shot to disable Brown rather than kill him is now irrelevant. To black youth and African-American communities in Ferguson and nationwide, the necessary response now is ""No justice, no peace!""To those reading this who may think I am exaggerating: Consider the recent shooting of Tamir Rice, a 12-year-old black boy carrying a toy pellet gun, by police in Cleveland, Ohio. Ask yourselves this question: Had the boy been white instead of black, would the police have fired their guns to kill him?It does not reduce the anger of African Americans in Ferguson and other communities that, nationwide, more young black men die at the hands of other young black men than at the hands of police. I don't have the space here to go into a more extended discussion of this issue, but suffice it to say that ""black-on-black"" crime is a contributor to the hopelessness that's so pervasive today among black men 25 and under.Most white people in America, and many middle-class or professional African Americans, might say, ""But why do they have to overturn police cars and set fire to innocent businesses?"" I'd respond that such acts, though deeply wrong, are nevertheless expressions of the aforementioned hopelessness experienced by so many black youth today. Their acts of violence say, in effect, ""You don't listen to us; we don't matter in your world. You have no idea of the numerous, ever-accumulating acts of disrespect by the police against us over the years. Unless you pay attention to and address the systemic hostility we experience daily from police, you will never understand us. Moreover, whether or not you believe us no longer matters, because we will no longer be ignored. You will pay attention to our pain!""President Obama appropriately condemned the violence, saying, ""Burning buildings, torching cars, destroying property, putting people at risk -- that's destructive, and there's no excuse for it. Those are criminal acts.... [N]othing of significance, nothing of benefit, results from destructive acts."" He explained that the achievements of the civil-rights movement and the passage of the Affordable Care Act ""happened because people vote ... because people organize. ... That's how you actually move something forward.""Unfortunately, I believe that these comments, though necessary, will have only limited success at easing the pain of young black youth in Ferguson and nationwide. Something more urgent and more direct is needed. The historic domestic and international accomplishments of the equally historic presidency of Barack Obama risk being overshadow and diminished by a perceived failure of his administration to substantively address the ticking time bomb of distrust between the police and young black men in our country today. So here's what I propose: The president and the attorney general should immediately convene a meeting at the White House of young black men and their representatives and the chiefs of police of most major urban communities to address this crisis head-on.And the issue is not just a political question; it is a moral question. As such, it is the unavoidable responsibility of parents and grandparents from the"" Joshua generation"" to save our children. We are legacy trustees of the hopes and dreams of our forefathers and foremothers from the days of slavery and its ideology of white supremacy. Consequently, we have a responsibility, here and now, in this second decade of the 21st century, to put an end to the license to kill our young black men that police across our nation seem to believe they possess. After Michelle Alexander's book The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness, we elder ""Joshua generation"" trustees cannot say we did not know what was happening to our young black men under the United States' criminal-justice system today. If we don't act to save our children, who will?The killing of so many of our young black men by police across the nation is -- to paraphrase James Baldwin -- our fire this time."

The California native says “I Shouldn’t Be Here” explores his multifaceted stage and screen career as a series of firsts, specifically his first holiday season in New York and his first time dealing with winter weather. The show fittingly hits Manhattan’s 54 Below on Dec. 1.  “It’s a grab bag from my whole life,” Snyder, who recently named one of Broadway’s 10 sexiest men, says. Stylistically, the set is “all over the place,” featuring songs from Snyder’s 2008 alt-rock album “L.A. Curse,” as well as tunes from his roles in “Cry-Baby” on Broadway, “Carousel” at Connecticut’s Goodspeed Opera House and the City Center Encores! production of “Fanny.” Also featured in “I Shouldn’t Be Here” will be “Cry-Baby” star Elizabeth Stanley and Matt Doyle (“Spring Awakening,” “The Book of Mormon”), who sang with Snyder on the 2007 recording of “bare: A Pop Opera.” Check out Snyder performing with Idina Menzel, then scroll down to keep reading: No doubt the show will venture into personal territory, too. At a press preview of the show in late November, Snyder crooned a Hanukkah-tinged rendition of the holiday classic, “Please Come Home For Christmas (Bells Will Be Ringing).” The song choice was a nod to Snyder’s embrace of “Chrismukkah” after he tied the knot with wife Jacqueline Dadon, who is Jewish. These days, the couple celebrates both Christmas and Hanukkah with two-year-old son, Oliver, and Snyder has tapped Broadway stalwart Seth Rudetsky to join him for a number or two during the show teach him “a little bit more about being Jewish.” For all of his work on Broadway, Snyder seems most proud of his “legit” 2012 turn in “Carousel,” which prompted the producers of “If/Then” to encourage him to audition for their show. If the actor has his way, his next stage or screen role will be in the same vein as that Rodgers and Hammerstein classic. “Not a lot of people my age and my type have really found their legit voice,” he says. “I don’t know what’s next, and of course I’m not going to say no to something contemporary, but I hope I get the chance to do something of that grandeur again, something of that size and scope. I grew up watching ‘The Music Man’ and ‘Oklahoma,’ and now that I’m here and I feel like I’m gaining some footing, I would love to go back to those roots.”James Snyder's ""I Shouldn't Be Here"" plays New York's 54 Below on Dec. 1.

What you may not realize is that Pollan is a man obsessed by live-fire cooking and he devotes the first section of his most recent book, Cooked, to the art and history of barbecue.I interviewed Pollan for my book, Man Made Meals: The Essential Cookbook for Guys, and excerpted it here to give you a taste.Name three techniques every guy should master. Grilling (but I don't have to tell you that): You invest money in buying tender premium cuts of meat and seafood, but you save on time. The cooking time for direct grilling is measured in minutes, not hours.Braising: This means cooking larger, tougher cuts of meat with liquid in a sealed pot at a low temperature for a long time. You invest time (three to four hours of cooking time, although your active participation is much less than that), but you save money, as braising is designed to make cheap cuts of meat tender.Cooking pasta: The secret is to use lots of water and plenty of salt and boil the pasta just long enough so it's tender. Basically, if you can boil water, you can cook pasta. One of my favorite side dishes is pasta tossed with extra virgin olive oil, fresh lemon juice, and sea salt.What are the three things to keep in mind if you're just starting out in the kitchen? Pay attention to where your food comes from. I won't buy meat unless it's grass-fed or pastured and ideally raised within a 150-mile radius of my home. Buy local first, then organic. If the ingredient list on the package has a lot of polysyllabic chemicals you're not familiar with or can't pronounce, don't buy it.Make friends with your butcher, fishmonger, produce man, and cheese vendor. Ask what he's most excited about today and tailor your shopping list and menu accordingly.Think quality, not quantity. It's better to eat four ounces of local grass-fed beef than a cheap 14-ounce industrially processed steak.Read more of the interview at BarbecueBible.com and in Man Made Meals.SIGN UP for Steven Raichlen's UP IN SMOKE newsletter to learn more about barbecue!READ MORE ABOUT GRILLING AT BARBECUEBIBLE.COM--Steven Raichlen is the author of the Barbecue!

(AP Photo/Steve Helber)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5fedb250000cf0039777b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week, Rolling Stone published an explosive story about a gang rape at a UVA fraternity. The article, ""A Rape on Campus"", written by Sabrina Rubin Erdely, is graphic and jarring and, for people not immersed in the topic, shocking. Erdely describes, in detail, a violent rape allegedly perpetrated during a frat party, by more than seven men, one of whom referred to the woman, Jackie, as ""it."" As horrible as the rape itself is to read about, the aftermath was equally or actually more enraging. She and her friends knew she would be publicly shamed if she came forward and the school's carelessness and willful denial verged on the criminal.Erdely masterfully captured how the culture at UVA could lend itself to the circumstances of this rape and others. After publication, other survivors of rapes at UVA came forward and filled the article's comments sections. There is, however, nothing new about rape at UVA, or gang-rapes on campuses, or the ways in which people in fraternities (small ""f"") are prone to engage in rape.Shamefully, only in the glare of public outrage, has school acknowledged what's been going on for decades and has committed to change. UVA President Teresa Sullivan explained earlier this week that Jackie's rape, and sexual assaults on college campuses, ""points to an entrenched cultural problem in student life."" That assessment, while true, is critically insufficient and UVA will not solve the ""rape problem"" on its own.Particularizing ""rape on campus"" in the search for real and lasting prevention and solutions will not solve the problem of rape on campus. The culture that enables rape is the broader one of male dominance, violence and exploitation.The Rolling Stone article came fast on the heels of allegations made against revered Canadian radio host Jian Ghomeshi (who was arrested yesterday) and critical media coverage of decades old allegations of rape against American icon Bill Cosby (whose accusers now number 19). At the same time, lost in the awful news shuffle of the past two weeks, was a detailed story about the sexual abuse of girls, competing in USA Swimming, by their coaches and another about three high school girls in Oklahoma bullied at school after reporting their rapes. Even though the Internet has heightened public awareness, many people simply refuse to believe that one in five women in the United States experience sexual assault. For men that number is one in 77, although I suspect it is higher. But, these statistics are, if anything, low.Rape, and unconscionably high institutional tolerance for rape, is a problem on campuses. There are ways that schools can reduce its occurrence, but sexual assault is everywhere. It's important not to focus on UVA when talking about UVA. Rape is a military problem. A Catholic Church problem. A celebrity problem. A respected media personalities problem. A Rotherdam problem. An early marriage problem. A gang problem. An elder care problem. A problem in mental institutions. A prison problem. A problem in the sciences. A problem in the Occupy movement. In police departments. In football. In swimming. On borders. In war. And, perhaps most frightening of all for many people a family problem. I say this because it's in families where investments in, and the effects of, gender binaries and their hierarchical outcomes, are intimate and personal. Where people become complicit as individuals, for what is often referred to as ""unpleasantness."" To understand how rape works as an oppressive, regulatory force in culture, it's necessary to understand how gender stereotypes and binaries work as oppressive and regulatory principles.What is almost impossible for some people to contemplate is that there are human cultures where rape is virtually unknown. Societies where women don't calibrate themselves, for their entire lives, to its threat. More than 40 years ago, anthropologist Peggy Reeves Sanday, professor emeritus of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania, conducted an extensive cross-cultural study of rape involving more than 150 human societies around the word. She found that 47% of societies she studied had no rape, 36% had some incidence of rape, and 17%, of which we are one, were definitively rape prone.What marked cultures where rape was missing were that women had authority in the community that was not related to reproduction -- they were political or religious leaders and made valued economic contributions to society; feminine qualities were valued by communities; the relationships between men and women was not defined as hierarchical; boys were taught to respect girls and women (something altogether different from learning to protect them); these societies were stable and peaceful, making reliance on brute male physical dominance less likely; divinities were not uniquely male; and, lastly, these cultures had great respect for their environments and did not destructively exploit them.On the other hand, rape-prone societies like ours are those which tolerate, encourage and often glorify violence as a marker of masculinity starting in early childhood. Boys learn that to be men meant being aggressive, competitive and dominant; work and access to authority are more rigidly sex segregated; women have minimal, if any authoritative roles in public or religious life or sports; femininity and feminine qualities are considered inferior and routinely mocked; ""women's work"" is undervalued and considered demeaning to men; and, women's roles were largely restricted to reproductive ones, their reproduction more likely to be regulated by men.Sound familiar?On campuses, where women students succeed academically (but continue to be marginalized by male dominant teaching hierarchies) it's easier to ignore the evident connections between gender, power and abuse in heated and frankly, distracting, debates about alcohol abuse. Alcohol, however, is a weapon used strategically, not a cause, and conversations that focus on it tend to ignore power differentials and how schools themselves enable serial predator. Alcohol doesn't explain how it is that rape is something many boys and men are very confident bragging about, especially to other boys and men. It doesn't explain why they think it's ok to issue instructions about ""luring rapebait"" or to secretly mark the hands of girls they've targeted for assault. What Erdely described is a textbook example of how rape is used by the powerful to abuse and dehumanize the less powerful and, often in the case of gang-rape, to form fraternal bonds. A study published by John Foubert, Jerry Tatum and J.T. Newberry in 2007 was one of four that found that frat members are more than three times as likely to perpetrate rape. For people concerned about false rape accusations, the best advice they could give their sons is to avoid frats, not girls.Sanday turned her critical lens to American fraternities and published her findings and conclusions in a book, Fraternity Gang Rape: Sex, Brotherhood, and Privilege on Campus, updated and reissued in 2007. She interviewed fraternity members and detailed specific rapes and the ways in which schools responded. In her painstakingly created portrait of daily frat life, she discusses pornography, initiations, hazing, and the role of bonding rituals, often built around degrading women. She also talks about efforts to create rape-free fraternity cultures. Sanday's thesis is one among many theories of rape. However, it has the advantage of spanning decades, of being derived from details observations across cultures and of having highly relevant applicability to today's stories. Her book about should be required reading for anyone even remotely interested in understanding the problem at UVA and elsewhere.The UVA story has been catalytic, as have other similar related events elsewhere. Students are protesting, there have been public calls to shut down the Greek system on UVA's campus and people previously confounded by the expression ""rape culture"" are now reconsidering what it means.Schools, it is evident, should not be adjudicating felony crimes. College sexual assault dynamics are a microcosm of larger ones, however. Moving college rape cases to the legal system is hardly a successful solution in a country where police routinely downgrade complaints and harass survivors, where hundreds of thousands of rape kits are left unprocessed, and where courtroom biases are so thick you could slice them with a knife.Rape is a gendered act of dominance, and popularly understood that way. It may be a sex crime, but it's an abuse of power. Rapists easily intuit this and rely on status quo hierarchies to act with impunity. They are not strangers. They are not monsters. They are teachers who assault students, priests who assault alter boys, celebrities who assault fans, coaches who assault athletes, high ranking military officers who assault their soldiers, fathers who assault children, senior frat boys who assault freshman girls. They count on good people looking away and deferring to their privileged place.Respect for female authority and seeing women as more than useful for their sexual and reproductive value, it is safe to say, are not central values in fraternities. But, this is also fundamentally true in so many of our major institutions, where women remain, uniformly either less than 17% of those with authority or completely cut out of power. Globally women still make up on average 20 percent of legislatures. The U.S. ranks 79 in the world for female representation. Women make up fewer than 15 percent of corporate board membership; religious hierarchies virtually all exclude women. These are not random facts disconnected from the issue of rape and the role its definition plays in how rights are understood and distributed.It is a massive risk, and an act of bravery, to come forward and accuse a person, or several people as in Jackie's case, of rape. It usually involves accusing a person with authority or higher social status. Awareness of this fact is very evident at UVA and in Bill Cosby and Jian Ghomeshi accusations. Importantly, higher status translates into credibility, a perk of status that rapists also exploit.For anyone really interested in understanding how seven perfectly average boys could so viciously rape a female classmate at one of the nation's most elite schools, how they could hold her down, violate her, call her ""it,"" and get away with it until now, I'd suggest a good place to start to put what is happening at UVA in context of the broader culture that we all live in and contribute to. It's one still largely governed by the idea that complementary roles for men and women means separate but equal, which is demonstrably untrue when it comes to authority and status, and almost always conservatively protects the hierarchies that lend themselves to sexual abuse.Fraternities on campus are powerful and impart status to boys, who then use it in traditionally acceptable ways. They can and do change. As disturbing as it is, we can and do challenge and create new norms. It is a good first stop to look at closely-held, family-friendly ideas about what makes ""real"" boys and girls and think about how they contribute to double standards in early childhood. The more stereotypes, the more binary, the more hierarchical and authoritarian, the higher the likelihood that rape will happen and be tolerated, as it has been at schools across the country. UVA's rape problem is everyone's rape problem."

""It's misleading.""Obama's pledge to double power generation in Africa within five years looked highly ambitious from the start. Per capita electricity output in Sub-Saharan Africa has been flat for three decades because most promised power plants never get built.""We're dealing with megawatts on paper, rather than on the grid,"" a second source working on the project said.""Is that really what Obama promised?""The first African-American U.S. president, the son of a Kenyan father, Obama has often been criticized for a lukewarm engagement in Africa, consisting more of words than deeds. ""WE'RE LIKE A PHARMACIST""The 48 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, with a combined population of 800 million, produce roughly the same amount of power as Spain, a country of just 46 million. This constrains Africa's growth and keeps hundreds of millions in poverty.Power Africa coordinator Andrew Herscowitz told Reuters there had been some confusion about the role of the program. He said it was always intended to ""expedite transactions,"" facilitating private investment rather than handing out aid.Herscowitz said Power Africa was there to help the private sector deliver electricity and it had already negotiated commitments from companies worth $20 billion, although he did not know how much of this money had been spent.""We're like a pharmacist, where people come to us, we reach out to people and figure out what is needed,"" he said.""In some projects we may have a lot of involvement and in some we have very little involvement.""Foreign companies sign billions of dollars of agreements with African governments to build infrastructure every year, although a large number never get built.In April 2011, the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corp., a government aid agency involved in Power Africa, signed a $350 million deal to ""revitalize"" Malawi's power sector.More than three years on, 1.7 percent of that money has been spent, according to the program's website, which gives no detail on progress on the ground.Memoranda of understanding Power Africa signed this year with its six focus countries -- Tanzania, Nigeria, Kenya, Ethiopia, Liberia and Ghana -- contain less than $100 million of financial commitments targeted at specific countries, most of which is for consultants.U.S. consultancy Tetra Tech won a $64 million contract and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair's Africa Governance Initiative was given a $3 million deal.As with many African aid projects, rights groups have criticized Power Africa as mostly being a vehicle to subsidize U.S. companies.Documents show $5 billion out of the $7 billion pledged is for loans for U.S. exports from the government's Export-Import Bank (EXIM) and Overseas Private Investment Corp. (OPIC). TURN ON THE LIGHTS""It's absolutely not true. Power Africa is an opportunity to turn on the lights for millions of Africans by taking investment from all over the world,"" Herscowitz said.Herscowitz rejected suggestions Power Africa merely tapped into existing projects, highlighting a 5 megawatt ""NextGen"" solar project in Tanzania and a 30 megawatt biomass scheme in Kenya which he said ""didn't exist before Power Africa.""The NextGen project website, however, says a power purchase agreement for the solar project was signed in January 2013, six months before Power Africa was launched.It is by no means guaranteed that the Power Africa program, which has an initial five-year mandate, will continue or be seen as a priority when Obama's final term ends in two years, U.S. government sources told Reuters.In addition, the investment banks EXIM and OPIC are fighting for their survival in Congress, where Obama's Democratic Party was severely weakened in mid-term elections this month.In a change of tack, the U.S. government said this month it wants to partner with China on improving power in Africa. Meanwhile, corruption in the countries that Power Africa operates in remains a problem.Nigeria's state oil company was accused last year by the then central bank governor of withholding $20 billion in oil funds due to the government, while Tanzania's parliament is currently reviewing a report on graft in its energy sector.

(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6110dc0e260000f9a05251aa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With the exception of a spike immediately after September 11, Americans don't trust their government.Take a look at a graph of public trust from 1958 to 2014, and you'll see the rate drop from around 70 percent half a century ago to the dismal 20-something depths of today. The government shutdown in 2013 -- the supreme expression of political gridlock -- even further reduced that trust. With approval ratings in the low teens, Congress has been the focus of voter dissatisfaction, particularly among those who follow politics closely.Given this state of affairs, you'd think that someone who could cut through the Gordian knot of Washington politics would receive the same accolades that Alexander the Great did when he solved the legendary problem of the Phrygians.But last week, when President Obama issued an executive order on immigration, he received little praise outside his own party and the community most affected by deportations.In Congress, House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) criticized Obama for being an ""emperor"" -- a description that doesn't have quite the cachet it once had in Alexander's day -- and promised to fight ""tooth and nail"" to undo the order. The American public, although supporting the content of the order 57 percent to 40 percent, opposed the order itself 48 percent to 38 percent. Even Saturday Night Live chimed in with a Schoolhouse Rock-style skit showing the president throwing an earnest Bill down the Capitol steps in favor of a cigarette-smoking thug of an Executive Order.By this time, you've heard all the explanations in support of the latest executive order, which allows as many as 5 million undocumented immigrants to stay in the United States as long as they meet certain conditions. As the president has explained, the House failed to vote on thecomprehensive, bipartisan immigration reform bill the Senate already passed in 2013. Moreover, Obama hasn't used executive orders nearly as much as his predecessors (33 per year versus 36 by George W. Bush, 45 by Bill Clinton, or 62 by Richard Nixon). And it's not as if Obama has been ""soft"" on immigration given the huge number of deportations that have taken place on his watch.So, if the order is well within the realm of legitimate presidential action, most Americans support its intent, and there is a generally low regard for gridlock in Washington, why the backlash? Clearly we want our presidents to be decisive, but not too decisive. Clearly the Republicans are more adept at spin. And clearly we have to dig a little deeper to understand the travails of American politics, and how they're connected to a more systemic disease affecting democracy across the globe.Gridlock PaysThe U.S. political system was designed in some sense to be inefficient. By distributing power among three branches and instituting other ""checks and balances"" into the system, American democracy was supposed to harmonize competing interests in such a way as to prevent both tyranny and anarchy.Gridlock, in other words, is the occasional price we pay to avoid kings and chaos.It hasn't all been harmony, of course, as the Civil War grimly demonstrated. But American democracy survived that challenge and even, through constitutional amendment and incremental policy change, managed to improve itself.Until we seemed to hit a wall at some point in the 1970s. As economist Mancur Olson and others have pointed out, the rise of interest group politics effectively strangled the political process. A failure to overcome entrenched interests translated into a failure to innovate, ultimately producing what Jonathan Rauch has termed ""demosclerosis."" We have become too pluralist for our own good: our pluribus has overwhelmed our unum.Let me introduce a caveat here that will reveal my bias. Public interest groups have served to expand democracy (think: the civil rights movement, women's movement) while private interest groups have served to concentrate wealth (think: business lobbies).The intersection of public and private--middle-class entitlement programs--have tended to support economic democracy, namely more equitable distribution of the wealth. We still benefit from lobbying in the public interest (think: environmental regulations). But private interests have metastasized (behold: an official figure of about 12,000 lobbyists and anunofficial figure of 100,000, most of whom represent industries like pharmaceuticals, insurance, and energy). And middle-class entitlement programs are going the way of the middle class itself--squeezed between the super-rich and the working poor. The Affordable Care Act, which qualifies as a middle-class entitlement through its tax credits and expansion of Medicaid, may well be the last gasp of the quaint old welfare state.Francis Fukuyama, in a recent Foreign Affairs piece, argues that two trends have made matters worse. We are an overly litigious society, which means public policy is increasingly decided in the courts (and thus outside the realm of the voters). And, through the effect of money on politics, wealthy interest groups effectively control Congress. These are not new ideas: lawyers and lobbyists have long had us by the short hairs. As Thomas Friedman wrote a couple years back, ""Our deformed political system--with a Congress that's become a forum for legalized bribery--is now truly holding us back.""Well, it all depends on who the ""us"" is.What if you don't particularly like government or, following Margaret Thatcher, think there's no such thing as ""society""? The Reagan/Thatcher ""revolution"" was designed to trim the government's role in the economy--reducing taxes, privatizing state enterprises, opening up public lands to private interests. Only the military sector escaped the knife. Many of these neoliberal approaches found their way into subsequent Democratic administrations (such as Clinton's welfare reform and Obama's market-based health care reform).So, when liberals largely accept neoliberal assumptions, the next step is to throw so much sand into the machinery of government that the engine practically grinds to a halt. A gridlocked government effectively allows private interests--the market, the wealthy--to operate unfettered. ""By fostering gridlock, the U.S. Constitution increases the likelihood that policies will reflect broad, unorganized interests instead of the interests of narrow, organized groups,"" writes Marcus Ethridge for the Cato Institute. By ""unorganized interests,"" he means those rich enough not to need to act collectively.The sad part of the story is that the polarization of politics--which proceeded lockstep with the polarization of the economy--largely takes place at the elite level. The electorate, whether in Blue states or Red states, has very similar attitudes--as measured in a study that found divergence in only 4 percent of the polling answers across nearly 400 policy questions.In other words, American gridlock is a largely manufactured phenomenon.So, if Congress no longer reflects the will of the people, is it then permissible for the president to bypass the legislative branch to ensure a more perfect union? When it comes to immigration and a number of other issues, I would say yes.Overcoming Checks and BalancesBut ultimately, presidential fiat is no solution to the problems of America's democracy. Let's look at two other countries that face similar conundrums.The first is Japan, a country that values consensus above all. There's even a word in Japanese--nemawashi--that means ""laying the groundwork"" for consensus before the parties arrive at the negotiating table. Japan has enjoyed a strong consensus for more than 50 years in favor of the constitutional provisions that restrict the country's military to self-defense. But the current government of Shinzo Abe is eager to upend these provisions and transform Japan into a ""normal"" country with a capacity to mount military offensives. His party doesn't have sufficient votes to amend the constitution.So, back in July, Abe issued a ""Cabinet decision""--essentially an executive order--that commits Japan to ""collective self-defense."" In other words, the country will go to war in defense of an ally even if Japan itself has not been attacked--and even though most Japaneseoppose this constitutional interpretation and want to retain the ""Peace Constitution.""In Hungary, meanwhile, the government of Viktor Orban and his Fidesz party has a parliamentary super-majority. When the Constitutional Court has ruled that a new law violates the Hungarian constitution, the Fidesz-led parliament has simply amended the constitution. The EU has protested against the new media law. The European Court of Human Rights has ruled that the Hungarian constitution violates ""freedom of religion."" The U.S. government is unhappy with the energy deals that Budapest has made with Moscow. Most disturbing, Fidesz has used its newfound powers to establish a patronage system that rewards the elite clustered in and around the party.""It never before happened in the EU that a country suddenly made a U-turn back from democracy toward some kind of half-democracy,"" Hungarian sociologist Andras Bozoki told me. ""When Austrians elected the Haider party, there was a huge protest in the EU. There was also a marginalization of [former Italian Prime Minister Silvio] Berlusconi. But none of these people had a two-thirds majority in the parliament, so they couldn't change the constitution.""Here we have the tyranny of the majority (Fidesz and its parliamentary dominance) and the tyranny of the minority (Japan and the program of the hawks). But in both cases, the Hungarian and Japanese governments identified ways to overcome checks and balances: Abe found a way around both the constitution and public opinion, while Orban simply changed the constitution to suit his needs. The elite in both cases advanced its agenda in undemocratic ways. When democratic rules produce undemocratic outcomes, faith in the system ebbs accordingly. In both countries, voter turnout has declined over the last decade, and many citizens are simply disgusted with politics.At first glance, Obama's executive order resembles Abe's Cabinet decision and the actions of Fidesz to rewrite the constitution. But the president's action on immigration was democracy-enhancing rather than democracy-reducing because it reflected majority opinion on behalf of a powerless minority. It distributed benefits more broadly rather than concentrate them in fewer hands.Dealing with Democratic DeficitsStill, all three cases reflect a common problem.People do not feel that their governments are building consensus through popular participation in order to move their respective countries forward. The systemic disease afflicting democracy across the globe is its increasing formalism. Democracy has become more about bureaucratic procedure and less about demos, the people. We have a democratic deficit: our views are no longer represented faithfully by our elected officials. For better or worse, we've experienced tremendous economic, social, and technological change over the 50 years, but our democratic institutions have yet to receive an upgrade.Some countries have tried to address this problem of the democratic deficit by setting up different institutional mechanisms to involve citizens in policy making. Denmark, for instance, introduced ""consensus conferences"" that bring citizens together to discuss technology issues, a model that has been adapted in other countries to address plant biotechnology, GMOs, and climate change. The EU has experimented with deliberative democracy to involve people from all the member states to help chart Europe's future. I wrote a few weeks ago about how the mayor of Seoul is expanding participation in policymaking at the municipal level on energy issues.And here in the United States, an organization called Voice of the People is setting up Citizen Cabinets in which people serve six-month terms, get briefings from experts, and weigh in on key policy issues every three weeks through on-line questionnaires. The results then go to lawmakers, who will ignore such a super poll at their own peril. The first cabinets are being set up now in Maryland, Virginia, and Oklahoma. In this way, our democracy regains its legitimacy by strengthening the link between the people and the institutions of government.It might sound counter-intuitive to break political gridlock by bringing more people into policymaking. After all, the tendency is to assume that smaller groups are more efficient, with one person being the most efficient of all. But that's where we fail to appreciate the roots of political dissatisfaction. We want to believe that our voices count for something, and not just in the isolation of the voting booth or the cacophony of social media.In the 4th century BC, Alexander the Great proved his imperial pedigree by cutting the Gordian knot. But we live in a democratic age, and we are suspicious of individuals or political parties that promise such solutions. The world is more complicated. The knots are somehow knottier. Bringing in a council of concerned citizens to patiently untie the Gordian knot of politics may take longer. But, in the end, consent is mightier than the sword.Crossposted with Foreign Policy In Focus"

Images of unarmed young people handcuffed and lying face down on the ground, or police officers in helmets and body armor facing off against them are never reassuring. At times, I found myself re-winding the footage over and over to be certain I had just seen what I thought I had, given the surreality of the events represented. Protesters carried signs pleading for peace, equal justice and cries for their voices to be heard, and recognized, amidst tear gas, and thick smoke from burning buildings, or vehicles. This was not reportage from Ferguson, Missouri where an empaneled grand jury decided not to indict a white police officer in the August 9 shooting death of an unarmed African-American teenager, but from Selma and Birmingham, Alabama; Mississippi; Tennessee; Arkansas; Detroit; and Washington, D.C., as depicted by the seminal, near-30-year-old documentary of the American Civil Rights Movement, ""Eyes on the Prize."" I had started out watching the breaking news footage of Ferguson's disintegration on Monday evening after a St Louis County grand jury's decision not to indict Officer Darren Wilson in the death of Michael Brown was announced, but couldn't stomach it for very long. I was hoping that by looking back at the struggles of activists fifty, sixty years ago through the frame of ""Eyes on the Prize,"" that I could draw useful parallels and contrasts to what has been unfolding over the past couple of months, coming to a head this week.A native of St Louis, long a New York City expat, I less felt anger than shame at the inevitability of it all. The largely African-American protesters who took control of the streets in Ferguson -- some, but certainly not all, violently; the local mayor, police chief and state governor who despite predicting the possibility of unrest still seemed taken off guard when it actually happened; and the national journalists, usual casts of pundits, celebrity clergy and activists who likely had never heard of Ferguson before August 9 but were either waiting in the wings for ""something"" to happen, or parachuted in as soon as possible once it did. The decision not to indict, the outburst of rage, best exemplified by Michael Brown's stepfather, Louis Head, who implored a restless crowd to ""Burn this bitch down!"" And ultimately, the relentless descent into chaos and the communal implosion of Ferguson, a suburb on the outskirts of St. Louis City. Performers cast in a familiar play with specific roles to play once the curtain went up.For the brief period of time I watched the St. Louis County prosecutor's press conference and immediate response on the streets, I couldn't help but think of two distinctive but very different quotes, both which were incredibly apropos. One by African-American poet Pearl Cleage at the outset of the 1992 riots in Los Angeles, ""it is the nature of oppressed people to turn on themselves."" The other, from an unidentified American officer in Michael Herr's classic tome of the Vietnam War, ""Dispatches"": ""We had to destroy the village in order to save it.""While I am upset and disappointed the grand jury's decision, I still draw hope in Michael Brown's family receiving justice for themselves and their son through the alternatives which still remain viable possibilities for them, in civil court and U.S. Department of Justice action. And to be sure, the residents of Ferguson and communities throughout the United States can and should use the resources available to them from living in a republic to change the laws which provide automatic protection to police officers such as Darren Wilson in situations such as these. Personally, my ire, or rather, frustration is with us, ""the elders,"" and leaders who failed the young people on the streets Monday night in Ferguson and across the country by not taking the time, or investing the effort in their understanding and appreciating the lessons of the civil rights movement and other successful non-violent efforts. Nor have we truly prepared them for sustainable, constructive leadership using their language and tools. In his 1964 collaborative project with photographer Richard Avedon, ""Nothing Personal,"" James Baldwin described a ""light,"" within everyone and the importance of it being maintained and carried from one generation to the next. He wrote, ""one discovers the light in darkness, that is what darkness is for; but everything in our lives depends on how we bear the light. It is necessary, while in darkness, to know that in oneself, waiting to be found, there is light. What the light reveals is danger, and what it demands is faith...The light. The light. One will perish without the light...For nothing is fixed, forever and forever and forever, it is not fixed; the earth is always shifting, the light is always changing, the sea does not cease to grind down rock. Generations do not cease to be born and we are responsible to them because we are the only witnesses they have. The sea rises, the light fails, lovers cling to each other, and children cling to us. The moment we cease to hold each other, the moment we break faith with one another, the sea engulfs us and the light goes out.""Rodrick K. Burton is pastor of New Northside Missionary Baptist Church in St. Louis. Leading a congregation of more than 600 people including a number of Ferguson residents, Burton has held at least half a dozen strategic meetings with clergy, law enforcement officials and local youth activists since Brown's death. A friend for more than thirty years since we went to high school together, Burton identifies a general divide between protesters around Michael Brown's death, and traditional leaders borne out of the civil rights generation twenty, thirty, forty years ago.""In this situation, the young people had actual power through the vote, as well as so much knowledge in resources such as the Internet, and social media tools, but instead chose violence,"" he observed in a lengthy conversation we had the night of the grand jury announcement, after he'd returned home from being on the streets of his church's community and Ferguson. ""When the violent protests are over, these actions will have no impact on the next black person shot and killed by a police officer, and there will be another one. The activists in the 60s studied struggle, but the younger generation are disconnected from the deeper history of the civil rights movement and others. They're not studying the struggles to apply what could have been done successfully (in Ferguson) even before the grand jury decision, but have chosen another route. The Department of Justice said the (local) clergy were not showing leadership in this situation, and they were right. We'll be out with the protesters but we are not leading or organizing them in a positive way. Many groups coming here from outside the community were also not a help, speechifying and not speaking to the core issues of what is happening on the ground with destruction of businesses, black and white, and provocation of physical confrontations with the police. Ultimately, more black people must participate in government and change the political and economic realities."" "

The result is a quieter experience on a day that has traditionally kicked off the holiday shopping season, and often drawn chaotic crowds.Black Friday has ranked as the busiest U.S. shopping day in terms of sales and traffic since 2005, according to ShopperTrak. But as demand shifts to Thursday and even earlier in the month, the research firm predicts that ""Super Saturday"" on Dec. 20 will be the most active day this year.""It just looks like any other weekend,"" said Angela Olivera, a 32-year-old housewife shopping for children's clothing at the Westfarms Mall near Hartford, Connecticut. ""The kind of crowds we usually see are missing and this is one of the biggest malls here. I think people are just not spending a lot.""The crowds normally reserved for Black Friday morning appeared on Thursday night. For instance, more than 15,000 people lined up for the opening of the flagship store of Macy's Inc in New York on Thursday. Retailers also said they were capturing more of the holiday budget online.Shares of Macy's, Wal-Mart and Target Corp closed from 2 to 3 percent higher on Friday as investors were encouraged by the long lines on Thursday night and executives made bullish comments about demand. Lower gasoline prices also helped boost the shares, analysts said.""It's off to a good start,"" said Charlie O'Shea, a retail analyst at Moody's Investors Service, about the shopping season after visiting nearly two dozen stores in northern New Jersey over the past two days.In downtown Chicago, police arrested 11 people associated with workers' rights group OUR Walmart for blocking traffic in front of a Walmart store. The protest was one of 1,600 planned across the United States by the group, which is pushing for higher wages and benefits for the retailer's employees.""Wal-Mart, Wal-Mart you're no good. Treat your workers like you should,"" a crowd of several dozen shouted outside the store.Wal-Mart spokeswoman Brooke Buchanan said: ""The crowds are mostly made up of paid union demonstrators, and they do not represent the views of the 1.3 million associates"" who work for the company, the largest private employer in the United States.Buchanan also said one of the demonstrators hit a customer at the Chicago store, prompting a complaint to the police.OUR Walmart representative Georges Tounou said the group carried out its protest peacefully.Overall Black Friday online sales as of 1500 EST (2000 GMT) were up 8 percent from a year earlier, according to IBM Digital Analytics Benchmark.

He was 85. Mexican broadcaster Televisa, for whom Gómez Bolaños worked, first reported the news. The cause of death had yet to be disclosed at the time of writing. UPDATE: 11/29/14, 2:03 a.m. -- Univision reports Bolaños suffered a cardiac arrest around 2 p.m. in his home. The star died accompanied by his wife and former co-star Florinda Meza.A writer, actor and producer for television, film and theater, Gómez Bolaños was perhaps best known as the star of “El Chavo del Ocho” and “El Chapulín Colorado” -- television shows broadcasted across Latin America. Aimed at children yet enjoyed by adults, the shows earned a status across the region’s pop culture something akin to “The Simpsons” in the United States. The cultural comparison, however, doesn’t capture how overwhelmingly popular Gómez Bolaños’ creation became. More than 111 million viewers continue to tune into “El Chavo del Ocho,” which first aired in 1971, on a daily basis. That figure that tops the number of viewers who watched the Super Bowl in 2013 -- let alone the 33.6 million viewers “The Simpsons” reeled in at its peak in 1990.Born in Mexico City on Feb. 21, 1929, Gómez Bolaños originally studied engineering. But instead he launched an entertainment career when he answered a newspaper ad announcing a television and radio apprenticeship at an advertising agency, according to The Associated Press. More from The Associated Press:His two most famous characters were ""El Chavo del Ocho,"" who lived in the homes of Latin America and beyond with his barrel, freckles, striped shirt and frayed cap, and the naive superhero ""El Chapulin Colorado,"" or ""The Crimson Grasshopper."" His morning show was a staple for preschoolers, much like ""Captain Kangaroo"" in the United States."

On Thursday, more evidence of a forthcoming record arrived, as 44-seconds of a track purportedly called ""Rebel Heart"" leaked online. (Madonna repeats the phrase ""Rebel Heart"" at the beginning of the clip.)Release of the song snippet, which sounds like it was recorded off a speaker, was not sanctioned by Madonna's management. Here's Guy Oseary, Madonna's manager:As Billboard noted, the track could be a collaboration between Madonna and Avicii, as she had posted a photo to Instagram featuring the producer and DJ with the hashtag ""#rebelheart"" nine months ago. Or maybe that's the name of the possible album: Madonna has used the ""#rebelheart"" hashtag on many photos, including one from earlier this month of Chance the Rapper.For more, head to TheWrap."
