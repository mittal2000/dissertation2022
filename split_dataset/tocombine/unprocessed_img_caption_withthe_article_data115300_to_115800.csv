Rabble-rouser.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/who-cares-about-the-price-of-almond-milk_b_5599217.html,Do they not understand there are more costs to bringing a product to market beyond the cost of a single ingredient? Is anyone shocked that it's ultimately cheaper to make everything at home?,2014-07-18,2014-07-18-130213_Califia_48oz_Almondmilk_4upLineup_NFLOWERS.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-18-130213_Califia_48oz_Almondmilk_4upLineup_NFLOWERS-thumb.png,"As someone that works within the retail food sector, I am truly quite puzzled by the recent ""news"" pieces getting circulated regarding the price of almond milk. If you haven't heard, the gist is that some people seem to be outraged that almond milk is cheaper to make yourself, because almond milk is basically a small amount of almonds blended with filtered water.What I find astounding, is that people 1) didn't already know this and 2) are shocked that it's cheaper to make food at home. I don't quite understand why almond milk is being targeted. Any food bought from the store is going to be cheaper to make at home.An article on Mother Jones, claiming almond milk is a scam, points out that according to their calculations, there are about .39 cents of almonds in a $3.99 container of almond milk. Who cares? Almonds are just one ingredient and there are a lot of other costs that need to be considered before a product gets to a shelf.Food manufacturers have packaging, labor, production, shipping, graphic design, marketing, etc. costs in addition to the cost of a single ingredient. The actual cost of producing the $3.99 container of almond milk is probably a lot higher than .39 cents.After production, brokers typically sell the product to distributors, who in turn sell it to the retail outlet where the end consumers make their purchase. A markup and margin gets taken each step of the way. In other words, it's pretty elementary thinking to assume that since the almonds cost .39 per container that the company is profiting to the tune of $3.60 per unit.This is why I am puzzled and confused about how this piece even began circulating. Does the author not realize that all food in a grocery store is marked up to make a profit? Do they not understand there are more costs to bringing a product to market beyond the cost of a single ingredient? Is anyone shocked that it's ultimately cheaper to make everything at home? It really almost makes you wonder if this could be some sort of clever PR campaign by the dairy industry. Certainly, I'm not making any accusations, but it does all seem very curious indeed. Perhaps the idea that it's more cost-effective to cook at home is a revolutionary idea for some people.Either way, almond milk isn't a scam and almond milk manufacturers aren't doing anything that any other retail food product isn't. There's no secret scandal and no one is getting ripped off. You can go ahead and drink your almond milk without feeling as though you're contributing to some sort of giant conspiracy."

Duncan and HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius toured the school in an effort to highlight U.S. President Barack Obama's proposals to expand high-quality learning opportunities as mentioned in his State of the Union speech.

Duncan has become the poster boy for reformsters, the face of everything teachers hate about this administration's education policy. When the administration has something annoying or distressing to say about education, it comes out of Duncan's mouth (usually in a particularly inartful manner).But the fantasy of having Duncan go away and be replaced by someone more suitable for the job, such as Diane Ravitch or Linda Darling Hammond or a person who is actually a teacher, is a fantasy, and it's a fantasy on the order of winning a million dollars in the lottery without having bought a lottery ticket.I've read the posts and tweets from people who still cheer for Obama. Their fantasy seems to be that someone will storm into the Oval Office, show the C-in-C exactly what his Department of Education has been up to and he will declare, ""What?! I had no idea! This will not stand! Get Arne in here so I can fire him!!"" And this is not going to happen, ever. Ever. There has never been the slightest reason to believe that the president is not fully aware of what his education policy is, that he is unaware of what Arne is pushing or that he disapproves of any of it.Duncan is a spokesperson for a product. He doesn't run the company, and he doesn't build the product. When Quaker Oats decided to replace the old, racist sterotypical Aunt Jemima with a newer, more appropriate Aunt Jemima, they didn't change the product inside the package.The union resolutions and the never-ending petitions calling for Duncan's firing or resignation are not completely pointless -- they at least register discontent with the administration's policies. But the answer to the question ""Who would replace Arne Duncan"" is simple -- someone who espoused the same policies as Arne Duncan.At some point Arne Duncan will leave public service. He will walk into a well-paying job with some edu-bizness. Maybe Pearson will make him Vice President in Charge of Graphite Writing Utensil Paper Interface Point Enhancement, or maybe he'll become a hood ornament for a chain of charter schools. If that happens before 2017, he'll be replaced by More of the Same (Under Secretary Ted Mitchell would probably be a swell choice). We'd no longer have the benefit of his goofy charm, his basketball stories, or his way with words. But imagining that his departure would lead to a change in policy is like imagining that tennis shoes with cool stripes will make you run faster.A Duncan departure would have one advantage. It would give the administration the advantage of having a whole bunch of its opponents dancing around and singing ""Ding dong, the witch is dead"" instead of paying attention to what is actually happening.Duncan as a spokesperson makes a fine target at which to direct displeasure with the product. But don't confuse the man with the policies. Cross-posted from Curmudgucation."

Then objects started falling out of the sky,"" the 65-year-old pensioner said in front of her grey-brick home.""And then I heard a roar and she landed in the kitchen, the roof was broken,"" she said, showing the gaping hole made by the body when it came through the ceiling of the kitchen in an extension to the house.The dead woman's naked body was still lying inside the house, next to a bed.About 100 meters (330 feet) from Tipunova's home, dozens more dead bodies lay in the wheat fields where the airliner came down on Thursday, killing all 298 people on board.Still visibly shaken by her experience, Tipunova said: ""The body's still here because they told me to wait for experts to come and get it.""Another local resident in her 20s who refused to give her name said she ran outside after hearing the plane explode.""I opened the door and I saw people falling. One fell in my vegetable patch,"" she said. RED ROSE AND PLASTIC SHEETSIt was not only bodies that fell from the sky. Chunks of metal, pieces of luggage and other debris came crashing down to the ground in this agricultural area about 40 km (25 miles) from the border with Russia.The front of the plane fell in a field of sunflowers about one km (1000 yards) from Tipunova's home. Debris, bodies and body parts were scattered for miles around.Rescue workers say they have found most of the corpses, some of them largely intact, others mangled. Some have been piled together but others lie where they fell, the place identified by sticks placed in the ground with white cloth attached.Some of the corpses have been wrapped in almost transparent plastic sheets, the corners held down with small mounds of soil or stones. Pairs of uncovered legs poke out from under some of the sheets, and at least one had a red carnation on top.Among the dead were many women and children, including a boy of about 10 still lying beside the cockpit, his small body covered by a plastic sheet.Much of the scene was in chaos 24 hours after the plane was brought down. Abandoned shoes lay all around, with boxes of tablets that spilled out of a medical cabinet, empty suitcases and articles of clothing strewn over the fields.In an effort to clean up some of the carnage, body parts have been washed off the pot-holed road where they fell to the earth, along with parts of the fuselage and wings showing the red and blue Malaysia Airlines logo.Emergency workers, few in numbers on Thursday, had arrived in force by Friday, setting up base in two large tents. Journalists and local residents wandered largely unimpeded through the ashes and charred wreckage.Rebel fighters in combat fatigues watched the proceedings nervously. Kiev has accused them of shooting down the plane, but they have denied this and are pledging not to prevent an international investigation going ahead.The constant sound of mortar fire and shooting in the distance served as a reminder of the conflict raging between the separatist rebels and the government forces who are trying to quell their three-month old revolt against rule from Kiev.

He told a news conference Friday that Israel will continue its offensive until rocket fire out of Gaza is halted.

But if Israel doesn't relinquish security control, Palestinians cannot establish a state. The alternative, then, would be a single state in which Palestinians are residents but not full citizens.""That sentence, quite simply, spells the end to the notion of Netanyahu consenting to the establishment of a Palestinian state,” summed up Times of Israel editor David Horovitz, whom Ha'aretz described as a Netanyahu supporter. “If we were to pull out of Judea and Samaria, like they tell us to, there’d be a possibility of thousands of tunnels,"" Netanyahu explained. ""At present we have a problem with the territory called Gaza."" Giving the West Bank back to Palestinians would ""create another 20 Gazas,"" he said. As Horovitz writes in the Times of Israel, ""[Netanyahu] made explicitly clear that he could never, ever, countenance a fully sovereign Palestinian state in the West Bank.""None of this should be terribly surprising, as Netanyahu had long opposed a two-state solution before his recent engagement with the Obama administration on the issue. Of course, while he was supposedly negotiating a two-state solution in good faith, his administration doubled settlements in the West Bank and created a far-right-wing governing coalition largely opposed to a Palestinian state.Netanyahu's statements come as this far-right coalition has begun to fracture in light of the current military operations in Gaza. The leaders of rival right-wing parties now critical of Netanyahu also have their own notions, none of them positive, for the future of a Palestinian state.Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman, whose far-right Yisrael Beiteinu Party split up with Netanyahu's Likud Party over the Gaza operation, called for Israel to send ground troops to annex Gaza and place it back under occupation. ""Israel must go all the way,"" Lieberman said in a press conference on Tuesday. In a radio interview with Army Radio, he stated plainly, ""We need to decide whether we are going with an alternative that entails fully conquering the Gaza Strip."" The Israeli occupation of Gaza ended in 2005 when the government of Ariel Sharon unilaterally pulled out. Israel still controls Gaza's airspace and borders, and imposes import and travel restrictions.Lieberman has been joined by Economic Minister Naftali Bennett, head of the settler-dominated Jewish Home Party, in criticizing the Netanyahu government for its ""restraint"" in punishing Gaza. Bennett said in a July 5 press release that ""restraint in the face of rockets on women and children is not power."" In later statements he called for the Iron Dome, Israel's defensive missile and rocket interception system that is funded by the United States, to be turned into ""an Iron Fist -- a weapon of offense.""Lieberman and Bennett were the only two members of Netanyahu's security council to vote against a recent ceasefire agreement that ultimately did not materialize.The public statements outlining Netanyahu's opposition to a two-state solution come as these rivals present a clear challenge to his political position, and at a time when Israel is moving further to the right.Both Lieberman and Bennett already held positions on a two-state solution that were further to the right of anything Netanyahu said this week.Lieberman ostensibly supports the creation of a Palestinian state, but his plan would involve a territorial swap that would exchange Israeli areas occupied by Arabs for all the West Bank territories occupied by Israeli settlers, Lieberman among them. This would entail stripping Israeli Arab citizens of their citizenship as they are transferred into a Palestinian state, and is widely opposed by Palestinians and Israeli Arabs.Bennett, on the other hand, believes in a single state with the annexation of all Israeli settler territories into Israel and ""separate rules"" for Palestinians living in the West Bank. He recently said the two-state process had reached a ""dead end"" and that the ""Palestinian problem"" should be thought of like a ""piece of shrapnel"" lodged in one's rear end. These political challenges to Netanyahu's policy in Gaza have not only come from his coalition partners, but also from inside his own Likud Party. On Tuesday, Netanyahu fired Deputy Defense Minister Danny Danon for publicly blasting the administration over its ""restraint."" Danon, the recently elected head of the Likud Central Committee, has previously stated his opposition to a two-state solution, claiming, ""There is place only for one state on the land of Israel.""These critics are part of a rising right-wing political bloc whose radicalism has essentially made Netanyahu, despite his opposition to a two-state solution, a political centrist in Israel.The permanent security occupation of the West Bank that Netanyahu's remarks suggest essentially would be just a more formal continuation of the current occupation policy. And this is exactly the situation feared by officials like Secretary of State John Kerry, in which Israel is a unitary ""apartheid state with second-class citizens."" Or as former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert stated, the collapse of the two-state solution would precipitate ""a South African-style struggle for equal voting rights, and as soon as that happens, the state of Israel is finished.""Whether you think Netanyahu's position is ""bleak and depressing"" or ""savvy and pragmatic,"" Horovitz argues, ""Nobody will ever be able to claim in the future that he didn’t tell us what he really thinks.""Sign up below to get Ryan Grim's occasional newsletter"

We reconcile, but we do not apologize. We sweep under the rug, but we don't say the words.Not long into our relationship, my husband let me know that my habit of not apologizing wasn't going to fly. ""You can't act like this this,"" he would say, as I huffed and gave him the silent treatment if he so much as disagreed with which CD to play on a road trip. Sometimes I would walk away in anger. One time I actually hopped in my car and drove off, only to return, because I didn't really have anywhere to go.With his help, and more often with his example, I learned to swallow my bitter-tasting pride and say those two, gut-wrenching words: ""I'm sorry."" And I had to mean it. With time it got easier, and I learned that bucking up and acknowledging my fault felt much better than fuming and going to bed angry, the excruciating act of lying mere inches apart from one another, trying so hard not to touch. After almost twelve years of marriage, it's almost second nature for one of us to relent and say ""I'm sorry,"" if only for the sake of agreeing to disagree.Apologizing comes a little more naturally now, which is good, because as your typical flawed mother, I've been apologizing to my children pretty much since the day they were born.""I'm sorry my body wasn't fit to carry you full term.""  ""I'm sorry I don't know why you're crying.""""I'm sorry your sister inexplicably kneed you in the forehead. Maybe you shouldn't keep your head so close to her knee next time.""It rolls off my tongue now, effortlessly. Maybe I really do say it that often. Sorry. Oops! There I go again.Back when I was a perfect mother -- you know, before I had kids -- I swore that I wanted my children to be able to talk to me, to approach me. Confront me, apologize to me, and I to them. I didn't want to raise a family of sweepers, those who don't know how to admit their wrongs, or at least assuage a situation. Now that I do actually have children, I'm sadly no longer that perfect mother. I get the chance to apologize to my children a lot. Not just for things beyond my control, like my failing pregnancy health or the inconsolable wails of an infant or two. Now I have the chance to use my apologizing skills for a whole new set of screw-ups.""I'm sorry I yelled at you. I shouldn't have reacted that way.""""I'm sorry, but no I don't know where you put your [insert favorite, impossible-to-find toy of the day here].""""I'm sorry I forgot to pick you up from early release that time ... and that other time.""""I'm sorry. I'm not perfect. I'm trying my best.""My twins are six now and full of drama that I wasn't prepared for at such an early age. One of them in particular often declares vast injustices in her life and takes to her bed. No amount of reconciling or reasoning with her will do. Voices are raised, and I often find myself staring after her in disbelief as she runs from the room, then checking my watch to make sure I have not fast forwarded 10 years. If you are the praying type, please pray for me in the upcoming teen years.Her mood swings usually indicate that she's tired or hungry. I know this, but she doesn't. I know to give her some space, because we both need it. After some time has passed, one of us will relent. I'll go curl up next to her in her bed, or she'll seek me out in the kitchen. She'll lean her head into my belly, stick her left thumb in her mouth, and grab my shirt with her remaining fingers, a stronghold to anchor her to me.""I'm sorry, Mommy,"" she'll say. And she'll mean it.""I'm sorry too,"" I reply. And I'll mean it, too. Like Us On Facebook |   Follow Us On Twitter |   Contact HuffPost ParentsAlso on HuffPost:"

Well, what if someone offered you money to breathe air that is literally off-the-charts bad? A recent article from the Australian Financial Review says that Coca-Cola is doing just that, paying expatriate employees ""hazard pay"" to live in China's polluted air. A company spokeswoman confirmed the existence of the ""environmental allowance,"" but did not disclose whether Chinese citizens working for Coca-Cola would also receive additional pay. Concerns about the adverse health effects of the air have sparked protests among those who see the price China is paying for urbanization.An American Chamber of Commerce for Beijing and Northeastern China survey from this year found that 48 percent of respondents reported that pollution in China created challenges in recruiting and retaining executives. Coca-Cola's decision to enact new environmental hazard pay is the latest in a series of moves by major companies trying to keep employees enduring risk comfortable in their adopted country.This year, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said his country would ""declare war"" on pollution, and rolled out a plan allocating 2 trillion yuan ($330 billion) to motivate action on climate change. If you've been following China's breakneck march to industrialization, you've probably seen the reports of just how much damage they've done to the air. Despite all this, China is planning to reduce pollution dramatically by 2022, to prepare for potentially hosting the Winter Olympics in Beijing. They plan to reduce coal consumption, encourage use of public transportation, construct devices that limit the release of harmful particles, increase the use of renewable energy and more. "
18,ARTS,The Bard of the Upper Reaches,"Daniel Maidman, Contributorartist and novelist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-bard-of-the-upper-rea_b_5591261.html,"My favorite course in college was one of the obvious and simple ones: Shakespeare.

We read maybe 20 of the plays and talked about them. Our professor was an eccentric old Greek, Pete Phialas, who had been dragged out of retirement by a student of his. This student became a dentist and paid the school to keep Phialas teaching what had been the student's own favorite course. Phialas had a thick accent and a childlike, giddy love of Shakespeare. He approached the plays more as dramatist than psychologist or philosopher: what were the subtleties of interaction between these characters? What did these turns of phrase mean? Here's a taste of his approach, which I remember some 21 years on. Consider part of the famous speech about England, Richard II, act 2, scene 1:This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle, This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars, This other Eden, demi-paradise, This fortress built by Nature for herself Against infection and the hand of war, This happy breed of men, this little world, This precious stone set in the silver sea, Which serves it in the office of a wall, Or as a moat defensive to a house, Against the envy of less happier lands, This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this EnglandIt is a dazzling speech to consider on its own. But Phialas pointed out to us that in it, Shakespeare directed his actor in how to perform it. It is spoken by John of Gaunt on his deathbed. Each phrase is a breath. His breathing is uneven, and growing shallower - at first he can breathe out ""This royal throne of kings"" - but later, he has breath only for four syllables: ""This blessed plot"" - then shallower still, two syllables at a time - ""this earth"" - ""this realm"" - then inspired by his love of country, he summons the breath for an extra syllable: ""this England."" Behold Phialas unlocking for his students a more complex appreciation of Shakespeare as dramatist: Shakespeare as a writer endlessly sensitive to the peregrinations of the human experience, and capable of distilling them down to the dramatic progression and the telling moment. These scenes have at their core the profundity of life, but at their surface they are dressed up full of color and excitement - they make it easy for us to enjoy them, they invite us in - they make it fun to learn the truth - a gift which, like Bottom's dream, hath no bottom.At about this same time, I was looking at clouds a lot. The Shakespeare course provided me with a means to express something which had always seemed apparent: that while the lives of men are sometimes dramatic and meaningful, and often tedious and insignificant - so that, for instance, the 37 surviving plays of Shakespeare are a big deal in terms of the history of culture - the life of the sky is continuously Shakespearean. A great drama unfolds in the clouds, full of color and excitement. The clouds have majesty and variety, and they tell a complex and subtle story. This story has a cast of many characters, and divides up into scenes and episodes, but it has neither a beginning nor an ending. As long as there are vapor, light, and heat it will go on. We can read an act of Shakespeare any time we want, simply by looking up.I don't come across my species of nephophilia - cloud-love - very often. But here we have Carolyn Marks Blackwood, a photographer who is apparently as avid a follower of the Bard of the upper reaches as I am, and a much more active one: she takes the drama of the clouds for one of her key subjects. Her show of photographs The Elements of Place is currently on display at the Albany Institute of History and Art - see details at the bottom. The work that follows is all from the show.Consider her Evening II: Evening II, Archival Pigment Print, 40""x40"", 2013Now, this is embarrassing. I don't know the names of clouds. But whatever these clouds are, Blackwood composes them into a staccato landscape, diagonal bands of light stair-stepping from upper right to lower left. The light of the setting sun upon them is a violent red glow, like the light in a forge, and the clouds themselves look molten, as if they were boluses of hardened metal half-sunk in streaming iron. Seeming puffs of steam rise through the scene, and the eye seeks the cool blue shadows of the darker bands, scarcely finding any place to rest. The composition has little up or down to it, because it exists in the three-dimensional world of the clouds, unrestrained by a life spent crawling heavily on the surface of the Earth.Since the advent of the digital camera, so many people are taking so many pictures that a good cloud photo can easily be chalked up to chance. Therefore we reflect on a body of work when considering cloud photography. Cloud Series 109, Archival Pigment Print, 14""x14"", 2014Blackwood encounters the sky in an utterly different mood here. The first image is martial and heroic. This one is less formally dynamic, but it is not relaxed - rather, it is poised. A backdrop cloudscape relates a straightforward tale in turquoises and peaches of day edging toward night. Foreground of it are unlit clouds, skulking along, Iago-like, staining the scene with threat. Foreground and background are in dramatic tension, and once again, they are lushly three-dimensional, moving through a space without bias.Consider a third piece: Cloud Series 5, Archival Pigment Print, 14""x14"", 2010This is more akin to dissipation, dispersal. The clouds have lost their complex structure. They are spare and coming apart, making their way from form back to diaphanous vapor. The coiled energy of drama has been used up. The last few characters are making their way aimlessly from the stage, their lines exhausted. The scene returns to the beginning, to the blank page of the endless sky.Let me insert here an apology for these descriptions; they read awkwardly to me. One encounters music and clouds the same way, as stimuli to the narrative imagination. But writing it out direct is like writing out a dream - stilted and unlike the thing itself. If this were a piece of fiction, I could hide Blackwood's clouds behind a magnificent cast of characters. But it isn't, and my speaking of the clouds directly fails - I do not have a language of clouds.One might correctly argue that Blackwood is a consummate nature photographer. But this only captures part of what she is. She is a consummate photographer of abiotic nature. Living things rarely intrude on her work. Her nature is a nature of water, water in all its phases.  Hudson River Ice 200, Archival Pigment Print, 25""x30"", 2013There is a serene majesty, an icy grandeur, to her outlook. It is indifferent not only to humanity, but to all things that live and die in organic form: to plants, to animals, to fungi and algae and bacteria. Blackwood's Earth is given over to the inscrutable vitality of non-living things. I am haunted by a thought, that if one could only see the world in its proper proportions, then of course life would recede to a trivial rank in the order of things, and science would assume the place in one's heart that tragedy customarily occupies. The spin of the electron, the wheeling of galaxies: these would take their rightful places at the center of one's attention. The heart and attention themselves would begin to dissolve, borne aloft on a wave of awe, and one would enter into direct unity with a vast cosmos. This cosmos would not be merciless, because mercilessness implies a certain caring about the thing denied mercy. This vast cosmos would be incidentally merciless, inconsistently merciless - it would hurt only because it would not care. The contours of its values would be alien to human conception. The first, and possibly only, thing we could understand about this cosmos before leaving humanity behind would be its tremendous beauty, beauty in every facet from the austere to the spectacular to the voluptuous. The Bard of the upper reaches tells a tale of Shakespearean excitement, but it is not a human tale. Ice 101, Archival Pigment Print, 30""x40"", 2014I get a hint of this absolute cosmos from Blackwood's photography. Looking at it, I conceive of her as being like a nineteenth-century explorer, steely, hardy, loving to live but not fearful of dying. I think of her with her face half-hidden behind tremendous lenses, surveying her chosen landscape of unspoiled solitude to distant horizons. It is cliched by now to imagine that a perspective which so thoroughly excludes humanity forms in recoil from some tremendous personal pain. One is tempted to manufacture such a biography for the Blackwood one deduces from her work. But I don't know, first of all, if Blackwood is the explorer I take her for; nor do I know if she harbors some such pain. I don't personally believe the a-human perspective is necessarily born in grief, nor can I verify that this perspective is hers. I think it exists to some extent in all of us, and I suspect she unleashes her measure of it in her nature photography, which is only a part of her creative work. I know one thing about this work, because I asked: that she shoots most of it at or near her home on the Hudson River.Therefore I learn, or re-learn, two things from her work. The first is that, whatever the real Blackwood is like, I need somebody to be like my idealized explorer, and her work comes close enough to this lost ideal that I can justify my construction of her. My Blackwood is not the fearful Bard, but she is his authentic follower. I need the figure and the work alike, and this is part of why her photographs mean so much to me.The other thing I find is closer to home, a more ordinary but very useful truth: that if you are willing to walk out the front door and look at the world right in front of you, and really study it for a while, then splendors will unfold. This is what we get from the domestic Blackwood, the Blackwood who shoots where she lives. Surely she lives someplace nice, but it would be vague and drab before a less passionate eye. Only half its magic is itself, and the rest is her.--The Elements of Place: Photographs by Carolyn Marks Blackwood June 28 - September 7, 2014 Artists Reception July 17, 5-8 p.m. The Albany Institute of History and Art 125 Washington Avenue, Albany, New York, 12210Carolyn Marks Blackwood online All images courtesy of the artist except Richard II scene, via http://theplaystheblog.wordpress.com/2012/05/22/what-dies-with-john-of-gaunt-nothing-less-than-a-vision-of-the-world/"

You saved up enough money and purchased those tickets to the city you've heard so much about and always wanted to visit. You have Localeur on your iPhone. You've been reading city guides, YouTubing, and catching up on Anthony Bourdain's picks in the area for weeks. What's the next step?We're going to approach this under assumption that you will not be able to just buy yourself a good time -- or a personal guide. But you're clearly looking to make sure you enjoy everything the city has to offer. Given this information, this is how you lay the foundation for great experience. [Photo via Austin Localeur Kent Zambrana]1. The right place to stayFind someplace local and well regarded in the middle of the action. It may sound nitpicky, but finding a hotel at or near a busy intersection is be ideal. You'll want to be able to step out into the action on the street, co-opting the natural energy to add to your excitement. (There's nothing like the rush of a city's vitality as you walk out of those revolving doors.)2. Absorb the energyYou've made it to the hotel. Now, drop your things and get out of that room immediately, no matter how plush the pillows look or how tired you are. Figure out the tone and tenor of the city. Some of the best places to accomplish this, if you're close to one, are the local open-air markets. Locals are sure to be hanging around, and you can purchase local-made items. Bonus? There's probably going to be some excellent food vendors or trucks nearby. [Photo via Dallas Localeur Blake Bowyer]3. Experience localIt's easy to get lost in the ""great deals"" you might get from big-brand chains in the world's cities. But local establishments are more likely to maintain the essence of the city rather than the feel of ""what worked in the focus group."" Those businesses are going to employ locals who know the city, not just transplants from another location who sought better salaries. They'll know where you can find the best places to shop, spots for great views or people watching, and the local restaurants that no one knows about.4. Use what you've got in that pocketDon't get trapped in one neighborhood! Smart phones have made amateur cartographers out of all of us. They also allow you to get lost without actually ever being lost. And public transportation systems in some of the world's larger cities are already integrated into Google Maps, going so far as to tell you how long it will take to get from Point A to B. Want more? Uber is available in almost every important city in the world. [Photo via Chicago Localeur Heidi Childers]5. Get in some exerciseSeasoned travelers know that getting in a strong workout (or yoga session, if you're into it) is critical, especially if you've traveled far enough to experience jet lag. Your body has several ""clocks"" built in to maintain certain rhythms related to bodily functions. Enjoy new views with a good run, or use a local gym to work those internal clocks into local time. [Photo via San Francisco Localeur James King]6. Enjoy the viewThere's nothing better than a perfect view of the city skyline to commemorate your trip. Of course, you can do a little research beforehand, but get with the locals you meet along the way and ask them where they go for an epic photo op. If they're proud of their city, they're going to know where the secret spots with the most interesting perspectives are located.It's not a comprehensive guide, but following these steps will create a sufficient baseline for a great local experience. And the most important ingredient isn't listed: travel with enthusiasm. The best things about being away from home are those experiences you haven't planned for. Hey, you may never come to this city ever again. So go ahead. Take the road less traveled."

The purchaser, Palm Beach County developer Ram Realty Services, will clear out much of the area and punch in a 158,000-square-foot Walmart, as well as an LA Fitness, Chik-fil-A, Chili’s and 900 apartments, the Miami Herald reports. Preservationists worry the development will strip the land of its rare plants and harm its threatened and endangered animals, including two rare butterflies, the bald eagle, the indigo snake and the Florida bonneted bat, per the Herald.Laura Reynolds, of the Tropical Audubon Society, was devastated by the sale. “Our imperiled land is being replaced by Walmart, it’s sad,” she told CBS Miami. If an endangered animal is knowingly injured or killed during construction, sanctions could be issued to halt development, as outlined by the Endangered Species Act.The Herald notes that the developer has agreed to set aside 40 acres for a preserve.Ram forwarded The Huffington Post a statement by its chairman, Peter Cummings, who said: We have collaborated with the Miami-Dade Department of Environmental Resource Management and members of the environmental community to create a thoughtful plan for protecting and maintaining preserve areas on the property in perpetuity, including the present and future removal of invasive species. Cummings also noted that the company will meet with the Fish and Wildlife Service to ensure the group's concerns over this development are addressed. Walmart rep Bill Wertz offered HuffPost a statement on the development plan. It reads, in part:As a company that has actively worked for nearly a decade on conservation efforts to protect priority lands across the country, our expectation is that Ram continue working with the conservation community and regulatory agencies to ensure the nearly 50-acre nature preserve it has set aside provides protection to South Florida wildlife.Representatives did not immediately offer statements for the University of Miami.This post has been updated with statements from Ram and Walmart."
