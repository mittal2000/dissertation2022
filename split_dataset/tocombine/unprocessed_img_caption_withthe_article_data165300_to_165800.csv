This was also the dream Amsterdam-based travelers and married couple Bart and Sanne van Poll, a dream born over a beer in Brussels in 2007. The dream quickly blossomed into their reality -- a popular alternative travel website called Spotted By Locals where over 240 hand picked contributors, called spotters, in 44 cities across Europe wax lyrical about their favorite places in their home cities. Within the next 10 days (date TBD), look for Spotted By Locals to launch in the America, with spotters ready to go in San Francisco and New York. ""We love to meet locals when we travel and see how they live their lives; what places they prefer to visit the most. That's where we want to be. We think others will too.""Before Spotted By Locals, the avid travelers said they relied on paper guidebooks for facts and history that never change but too often arrived at a referenced restaurant or café to find it closed or brimming with tourists, with nary a local in site.""The problem with travel guides and websites, in our opinion, is that they are usually written by travelers and not locals,"" said Bart. ""Travelers visit a city for a short time and leave. They are not able to keep up with the current changes in the cities and spots they wrote about.""On a trip to Brussels, Belgium in 2007, Bart and Sanne followed in the footsteps of a local blogger who highlighted his favorite places to eat and drink in the city. Their experience was exceptional and authentic, and over a glass of the blogger's favorite beer at his favorite watering hole, the plan for Spotted By Locals hatched. When it launched in 2008, Bart and Sanne took a giant (dream) leap and quit their day jobs. ""If it didn't turn out to be the success we'd hoped for, we thought we could find another job.""Fortunately for them, Spotted By Locals took off and these days Bart and Sanne spend half the year outside of Holland, visiting their spotters and traveling to new places.New York and San Francisco felt like the natural places to launch in the USA, says Bart, adding, ""San Francisco is considered by Europeans to be one of the most beautiful and pleasant cities in the United States."" Bart and Sanne plan to have locals up and running in seven U.S. and Canadian cities by summer, and continue to expand in Europe. They've also crossed the border into smartphones with an app for Android & iPhone out (all offline, no need for wifi), and an app for the Windows phone in the works.""Spotted by Locals doesn't make us rich financially, but we are leading a dream life. We travel a lot and get the opportunity to meet an amazing amount of local city lovers from many countries.""This confirms what I've known all along, that following your dreams, and fueling them with Belgian beer, really pays off.

He said that 44 million Russians, nearly one in three, are hooked on smoking, and almost 400,000 die every year of smoking-related causes.However, the bill is controversial with Russian smokers.""This bill is a veil, behind which they want to bring in another prohibition, only this time for tobacco,"" Andrei Loskutov, director of the All-Russia Movement for the Rights of Smokers, told Reuters.""Let us act with understanding towards half of the adult population. Let us educate about giving up smoking with persuasion and education, and not throw out into the cold people who have spent their own money on a legal product.""Kiosk owners have said many could be driven out of business by the proposed changes. They have already been hard hit by a ban on selling alcohol last year.The law is also opposed by tobacco companies such as British American Tobacco, Imperial Tobacco, Japan Tobacco, and Philip Morris, which together control more than 90 percent of Russian sales and have been lobbying to soften the proposed legislation.The Russian cigarette market was estimated to be worth around $22 billion in 2011 by Euromonitor International.If passed, the restrictions will be phased in and are expected to be fully in force by 2016.The Finance Ministry has also previously announced plans to increase excise duty on tobacco by around 40 percent for 2013 and 2014, and by 10 percent a year after 2015. The Health Ministry supports a greater increase in duty.Putin, a judo black belt, lobbied successfully for Russia to host the 2014 Winter Olympics and 2018 soccer World Cup.Russia also needs to improve public health to restore population growth after measures to boost the birth rate and improve healthcare stemmed a steep decline after the collapse of the Soviet Union.

By November 2009 it had started to peter out but the WHO did not declare the epidemic at an end until August 2010.While this study did not set out to look at death rates, the researchers said they had used previously published and still-in-progress death rate estimates to calculate the proportion of people infected who died from the pandemic virus.Based on an estimate of around 200,000 deaths, they said the case fatality ratio was probably less than 0.02 percent.The WHO's official data show 18,500 people were reported killed by the H1N1 flu. But a study published in The Lancet last year said the actual death toll may have been up to 15 times higher at more than 280,000.Maria Van Kerkhove of Imperial College London, who worked on the study, said it would improve understanding of the H1N1 pandemic's impact and fuel efforts to improve prediction of future pandemics.""It puts it into context and gives us a fuller picture,"" she said in a telephone interview. ""That's incredibly important because we know this will happen again and there is a lot of effort being put into trying to prepare now...for the next one.""

The study, in the Journal of the American Medical Association on Tuesday, Jan. 1, 2013, is a small study and does not prove that fructose or its relative, high-fructose corn syrup, can cause obesity, but experts say it adds evidence they may play a role.

The USDA estimates that the average American ate 131 calories worth of corn sweeteners a day this year, down 16 percent from 2007. The decline follows several years of bad press for high-fructose corn syrup. Some have attacked it as bad-tasting, while many have argued that eating it is bad for your health. One recent study suggested that the brains of people who ate lots of fructose don't register as satiated, while another demonstrated a correlation between high-fructose corn syrup consumption and higher rates of type 2 diabetes. The corn industry has responded to this PR onslaught by claiming that high-fructose corn syrup had been ""unfairly maligned,"" and that it is no worse for human health than any other kind of sweetener. Some studies have supported this argument. If the corn industry is right, the recent estimates on sweetener consumption contain some troubling news as well. Sugar consumption rose 8.8 percent between 2007 and 2011, indicating that some consumers just shifted from one type of sweetener to another."

The letter Z is also becoming popular for new drugs like Zaltrap for colon cancer, melanoma drug Zelboraf and prostate cancer treatment Zytiga.""The X and Z trend was pretty hot and heavy eight or nine years ago - that's when we had names like Zoloft, Zyban and Zocor,"" said Vince Budd, senior vice president at brand consulting firm Addison Whitney's healthcare division, referring to popular drugs for depression and high cholesterol.""It was seen as an opportunity to create something unique,"" said Budd. ""I believe we have come full circle and we are back there again, especially in oncology.""Of the 15 drugs with ""X"" appellations approved by the Food and Drug Administration since 1995, seven were launched in the last two and half years.Marketing and linguistics experts say the rarity of X and Z in most words make for memorable, unique names. They are also ""fricative"" letters that imply speed or fluidity.""In terms of cognitive psychology ... they need a memorable, distinctive name that doesn't have negative associations,"" said Matthew Traxler, psychology and linguistics professor at the University of California, Davis. ""They may be distinct in terms of sound, but also visually distinct."" ERROR-PROOFING REQUIREMENTSThere are more practical reasons for the names.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration as well as the European health regulator both have strict guidelines, not always overlapping, for what would be an acceptable name for a new medicine.""You can't have a name look like or sound like another drug,"" said Scott Piergrossi, vice president, creative at Brand Institute Inc. ""Someone could receive the wrong drug.""The concern extends to potential handwriting errors.""Regulators want a lot of pen strokes up and down that provide a much more unique-looking name. It is more readable or interpretable if it has a lot of those letters,"" said Brannon Cashion, Addison Whitney's president.Whether anyone can actually pronounce the name is of less concern.""It's really about the novelty of the name,"" Piergrossi said. ""Sometimes we get clients that can't pronounce names that start with X. Usually it creates a 'Z' sound.""Since patients rarely choose their drugs - at least those for serious diseases - drugmakers see the need to tailor names to a more narrow audience than general consumers.""They are all going to be coined words,"" said Addison Whitney's Cashion. ""Whoever creates the word basically defines how it is to be pronounced.""That is a much different strategy than you would see for a more consumer oriented drug product, such as Allergan Inc's eyelash-builder Latisse.""Latisse is a more direct-to-consumer name. Patients will ask for it,"" Piergrossi said. ""It is a coined form of Mattisse with ""La"" for lash. It is an image-driven, evocative name.""For a cancer drug, the main target audience is oncologists or medical professionals. ""A pharma company may want to emphasize the drug's mechanism of action,"" Budd said.Piergrossi said Xeljanz, a new Pfizer Inc drug for rheumatoid arthritis, is a great example of both innovative and practical naming forces at work.""It includes both X and Z ... and the name is really key to the product profile,"" the Brand Institute executive said, explaining that the drug is designed to work by selectively blocking molecules known as Janus kinases.

Walker/Getty Images for CHANEL)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cafb42100003300c5397c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Co-Written With Steven LapidusWe trust you enjoyed part one of this article which was posted on December 21 here at The Huffington Post.Isn't life about experiencing different extremes, giving ample opportunity to contrast and compare? With this in mind, we decided early on to seek out something elegant and international in Shanghai, on the one hand, as well as regionally based and local on the other, to sample two different kinds of eating experiences.Our first stop was Jean Georges. Every area of the world has its own Gold Coast, where the best of the best reside and dine. For exceptional dining, Huangpu River -- overlooking Three on the Bund, home to Jean Georges -- is that destination. Flanked by the Capital M restaurant directly across the street (where we ending up eating in Beijing) and directly to the east of the Bund, Shanghai is the elegant backdrop for Jean Georges' amazing cuisine. It is a must for all foodies everywhere. Jean Georges has built his library of restaurants in Shanghai to stand with his other restaurants in other locales such as those in New York, Mercer Kitchen, Jean Georges, Spice Market and, of course, ABC Kitchen. As a marker to any number of special customer celebrations, we were struck by the immense bouquet of flowers posted at many tables. The dining room experience is enhanced by the mahogany, its wooded touches and adorned with burnished gold plate ceiling. The pièce de résistance is the 180-degree view of the Bund, the sleek Huangpu beneath and the looming Pudong financial district at river's far shore. The creativity of tastings abound, served with small single bites of elaborate selections of kingfish sashimi, avocado and radish, followed by delightful foie gras brulee garnished with dried sour cherries and candied pistachio. The tastings also included bites of fish and beef, a succulent Australian Wagyu beef sirloin and patty pan squash confit with mole and sherry vinegar. For our main courses, always happy for fish, we had delectable pan-seared sea scallops with spiced jade emulsion and celtuce and ever delicious lobster with passion fruit emulsion, baby carrot and porcini oil. To enhance every flavor, we sampled a myriad of fine wines from New Zealand, a Sauvignon Blanc (Terravin), from Spain Arzuaga, and from France, a Perrier Jouet Champagne, Crème de Mire. For chocolate lovers like us, dessert choices were equally overwhelming -- chocolate soup, chocolate soufflé and chocolate petits fours.Jean Georges never lacks for creativity with his roster of restaurants. Recently, in the same building (upstairs), he has opened Mercato, an Italian delight, with imported ovens to cook homemade pizzas and casual dining. It's a totally different vibe from his nameplate establishment, but equally engaging. New to Shanghai, Mercato promises to be a welcome addition to Bund dining.The next night we choose Xibo, a restaurant created by a woman named Anita Kuo, which is a totally different kind of establishment from Jean Georges. Anita's inspiration is derived from flamboyant Xinjiang style from the mostly small Muslim autonomous region of that name in far northwest China. Her home region borders Kazakhstan and lies along the ancient Silk Route from Central Asia to China. Xinjiang has a dialect and culture all its own. Unlike more traditional Chinese fare, Xibo ingredients of choice are lamb, beef and flat breads. There is a wonderful mixture of spices and condiments for which Anita actually travels home several times a year, six hours away by plane, to bring back for use in her restaurant.We had an absolutely delicious dish of fried Uighur bread mixed with lamb, onion, cumin and chili. We sampled traditional pumpkin soup and steamed pumpkin dumplings. Regional bread was featured again in a Xibanese grilled eggplant and pepper dish. We couldn't resist ordering some roasted lamb chops with rosemary, cumin and potatoes. We also tried barbecue skewers of lamb, beef and chicken served with cold noodles and a sesame sauce. Her noodles are washed and steamed in a particular way, certainly not commercial in any way. We couldn't resist trying a lot of things, you get the idea! Anita chose to build her restaurant in the former French concession of Shanghai. There is an extended terrace for outdoor dining and even a heated enclosure for winter nights. In the convivial space she has collected antique hats that represent the different ethnic groups of China which hang on the walls in interesting patterns. Diners can feel good about dining in this restaurant as not only can they partake in the freshness and quality of food, but Xibo also embodies a restaurant with a social mission, giving to charities in Western China. Xibo is a must choice when dining in Shanghai.Jean Georges: Telephone: 021-321 773 4th Floor, Three on the Bund, 3 Zhongshan Dong Yi Lu 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., 6 p.m. to 11 p.m.Mercato: Telephone: 021-6321 9922 6th Floor, Three on the Bund, 3 Zhongshan Dong Yi Lu 5:30 to 1 a.m.Xibo: Telephone: 021-5403 8330 3rd floor, 83 Changshu Lu 11 a.m. to midnight"

How do we do better?"" Michael Hogan, head of the President's New Freedom Commission on Mental Health, said in written testimony to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.""While the gaps in children's mental healthcare are huge, there is also reason for hope,"" he added. ""In part, this is because we know more about what works, and what doesn't.""Hogan, a former New York mental health commissioner, was scheduled to appear with two other experts Thursday at the Senate committee's first hearing on mental health issues since the presidency of Republican George W. Bush, who set up the commission Hogan now chairs.The hearing was scheduled in response to the shootings at Newtown's Sandy Hook Elementary School where Adam Lanza, a young man described as having mental issues, gunned down 26 people including 20 young children with an AR-15-type assault rifle on Dec. 14.The tragedy and other mass shootings in recent years have ignited a debate about gun control and mental health, including a push by President Barack Obama for stronger gun controls and better mental health training for schools and communities.Robert Vero, chief executive of a network of Tennessee clinics called Cornerstone, said mental health professionals who work with children also lack access to parents and other relatives whose problems may contribute to a child's troubles, sometimes due to inadequate insurance coverage.""We need to be able to teach parenting skills if we want the child's behavior to change,"" said Vero. ""We need to be able to address the parent's depression or addiction.""The experts credited Obama's healthcare reform law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, with making a step forward by requiring insurers including Medicaid to provide coverage for mental health issues.But they said the American social safety net still fails to provide adequate access for the poor and elderly, noting that state mental health funding declined $4 billion from 2009 to 2012 as a result of budget constraints posed by recession and the weak economic recovery.

NOLA. The Big Easy. And a visit to this eccentric and historic town just wouldn't be complete without experiencing at least one of the many things that make it such a unique destination. So, make your reservations, then make plans for these five must-dos. While you may or may not come home with a national championship, you'll definitely leave with a new appreciation for this bayou city.The National WWII Museum. This amazing museum tells the story of the American Experience in the war that changed the world like you've never seen before. From ""Final Mission: The USS Tang Experience,"" where visitors are placed aboard the submarine and participate in its final war patrol on October 25, 1944, to the 4D panoramic film Beyond All Boundaries, executive produced and narrated by Tom Hanks, you'll experience and learn about WWII like you never have before. And for return visitors the new Freedom Pavilion has just opened and offers so much more to see.Cajun dancing and jazz clubs. While two very different forms of entertainment, either of these is a great way to spend an evening or two. For jazz, get a traditional experience at Fritzel's, Vaughan's or Irvin Mayfield's Jazz Playhouse. And while Cajun dancing historically gets its influence from the Lafayette area, you'll find it hopping most nights at Mulate's and Michaul's, both where you can grab a nice meal then work off your dinner on the dance floor.The Audubon Nature Institute. With a zoo, IMAX theater, aquarium and even an insectarium, families looking to fill a few hours or a full day will find plenty to choose from at this nature lover's paradise. And there are great hands-on experiences for kids abound, including the Underground Gallery, where visitors ""shrink"" to the size of a bug and encounter surprises at every turn.Tours, Tours, Tours. In New Orleans, if you want to see it, there's likely a tour for it. And in many cases, great ones run by locals who take pride in knowing the history of their great city. Whether it's a tour about the history of the cocktail and the buildings where they were created, an original New Orleans movie tour, or a free tour of the French Quarter by the Friends of the Cabildo, these are some of the best ways to get know and appreciate the stories and culture of this vibrant community.Be a ""Voluntourist."" Truly experiencing a destination is just as much about giving back as it is about taking it all in. Taking a few hours or even a day participating in a volunteer activity may not sound like the most fun way to spend your time, but it will certainly be the most rewarding. Check out www.neworleansonline.com for a list of local organizations and opportunities and have a good time doing some good.Travelers making plans for this big weekend should note that hotel rooms in the city are sold out, but nearby areas including Baton Rouge, Gulfport and Biloxi still have available properties.

""The customers will tell us whether they would prefer to have extra fees or whether they would prefer to have everything bundled,"" he said.For those keeping track, Southwest's earnings fell by nearly half on higher spending but its revenues rose slightly, according to the Associated Press.Earlier this week, the airline announced that it would offer a $40 charge for passengers who wanted to be among the first 15 to board a flight. In December, the airline quietly announced that it would start charging for no-shows who purchased the cheapest ""Wanna Get Away"" fares sometime in 2013. Southwest has regularly been considered amongst Americans' favorite airlines. (It came in third in SkyTrax's best low-cost American carrier survey in the summer of 2012.) Yet Kelly alluded to the ferocity of the competition in the airline landscape in his CNBC interview. Unlike Southwest, its subsidiary AirTran announced new bag fees last December, including a $25 fee for the first checked bag (up from $20) and $35 for the second (up from $25,) the Associated Press reported. Thanks to AirTran's fees, Southwest collected $104.3 million in bag fees last year.To listen to the interview, click over to CNBC."
