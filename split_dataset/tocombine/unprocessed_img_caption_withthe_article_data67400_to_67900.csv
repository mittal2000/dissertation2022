0,POLITICS,Michigan Governor Asks Obama To Declare Emergency Over Flint Water Crisis,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rick-snyder-obama-flint-water_us_5698741de4b0778f46f8ebc1,Flint's water is still not safe to drink.,2016-01-15,Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder wants President Barack Obama to declare Flint's water a federal emergency.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_12_272_3066_1521%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) wants President Barack Obama to declare a federal emergency in Flint, where the water is unsafe to drink due to high amounts of lead, a deadly neurotoxin. “We are utilizing all state resources to ensure Flint residents have access to clean and safe drinking water and today I am asking President Obama to provide additional resources as our recovery efforts continue,"" Snyder said late Thursday in a statement.Snyder's office said federal aid could include things like grants for temporary housing and repairs. ""Public assistance helps cover some of the costs incurred by state and local governments due to damage to public facilities and infrastructures, such as city schools and the water system,"" the statement said. Flint's water went bad after the city switched to the Flint River as its water source as a temporary cost-saving measure in 2014. The state (and the federal government) failed to ensure the city treated the water to prevent it from corroding pipes, many of which are made from lead. The state denied there was a problem until a Flint pediatrician documented high lead levels in blood tests of Flint kids at the end of September. Lead can harm every system in the body, and young children exposed to lead can suffer stunted growth and brain damage. Even though Flint switched back to the Detroit water system, it's unclear when Flint tap water will be safe to drink again. Residents have been advised to use filters or drink bottled water.Snyder has already apologized for the state's role in the crisis and declared an emergency at the county level. This week, he called in the National Guard and asked for extra help from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.FEMA spokeswoman Susan Hendricks said the agency is reviewing Snyder's request and has already been assisting with the crisis response.“We’ve been actively engaged with the State of Michigan as it works to resolve the water issues in Flint,"" Hendricks said. ""On January 12, Governor Snyder requested FEMA support to help identify and coordinate relevant federal agency programs that may be available to assist with the ongoing crisis of the lead contamination of the water in Flint, Michigan. FEMA promptly approved that request and named a Federal Disaster Recovery Coordinator to provide this support.""This story has been updated to include FEMA's response. Also on HuffPost:"
1,POLITICS,Supreme Court Spares Bob McDonnell From Prison For A While Longer,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-bob-mcdonnell_us_569966dbe4b0778f46f96676,"The justices agreed to hear the gifty gov's appeal over whether his ""official action"" amounted to corruption.",2016-01-15,Bob McDonnell will remain free while the Supreme Court reviews his federal corruption convictions.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/569967832a00002c00030a21.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to take up the case of former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell (R), who in October urged the justices to review his multiple convictions on federal corruption charges.The justices' decision to hear the case effectively allows McDonnell to remain out of prison at least until the court issues a decision -- which could arrive as late as June.McDonnell's lawyers are trying to convince the court that the kind of ""official action"" federal law treats as corruption -- and that a jury agreed McDonnell committed while governor -- was no more than ""routine political courtesies,"" including activities such as ""arranging meetings, asking questions, and attending events.""""This is the first time in our history that a public official has been convicted of corruption despite never agreeing to put a thumb on the scales of any government decision,"" McDonnell's lawyers wrote in their appeal to the Supreme Court. ""Officials routinely arrange meetings for donors, take their calls, and politely listen to their ideas.""The lawyers warned that allowing McDonnell's 2014 convictions to stand would lead to a ""dramatic expansion"" of what government officials can't do under federal corruption law, potentially ""threatening to criminalize politics in America.""In McDonnell's case, his various dealings with Jonnie Williams, the head of a Virginia-based company, via staffers, a government lawyer and at public functions -- purportedly to benefit the company -- formed the basis for a prosecution leading to a five-week trial and immense publicity.A jury eventually convicted McDonnell on 11 counts of corruption under various statutes criminalizing improper ""official action"" taken on behalf of someone else or in exchange for political favors. His wife, Maureen, also was convicted.An appeals court upheld Bob McDonnell's convictions and put his wife's appeal on hold. But now, McDonnell's lawyers are arguing the appeals court's interpretation of what ""official action"" means sweeps too broadly and risks granting federal authorities too much leeway to go after ""ordinary politics.""And McDonnell is far from alone in thinking federal prosecutors overreached. Ahead of Friday's action by the Supreme Court, a broad coalition of former and current Virginia lawmakers, criminal defense attorneys, former federal officials, law professors and other supporters filed briefs backing the ex-governor and urging the justices to take action in his case.With McDonnell's appeal now on the court's docket, a hearing will take place in the spring.Though it's far too early to tell how the Supreme Court might rule, it's fair to say luck is already on McDonnell's side. In August, the justices granted him an extraordinary reprieve from prison -- something they rarely do."

Not long after, along with friend Jane Best, Stone founded God's Love We Deliver. The organization delivered meals, often on bike, to Manhattan-based individuals diagnosed with terminal HIV/AIDS. They delivered around 50 meals per week. Thirty years later, GLWD delivers around 1.5 million meals a year, thanks to 90 staff employees and about 8,000 volunteers. They now provide for anyone with a life altering illness of any kind, catering to 6,200 clients with over 200 distinct diagnoses. This year, they are the official charity partner of the Outsider Art Fair.""The people who founded this organization just wanted to do something,"" chief development officer David Ludwigson explained to The Huffington Post. ""It was a time of tremendous fear and stigma. People were dying of AIDS and they were alone. For the first year or two, there were meals, but there was also apartment cleaning, pet sitting, giving someone a massage or just sitting with them and having a cup of coffee. We eventually started to focus solely on the food.""""Our tagline used to be 'food for the body and soul,'"" added manager of communications Emmett Findley. ""It’s a very personal act to have someone cook you a meal and bring it to you. It brings relief and dignity. Today the language we’re using around our work is 'food is medicine and food is love.'""When describing GLWD, Ludwigson uses the term ""nutrition nonprofit"" -- not food, not hunger, he specifies. Everything in GLWD's kitchen is made from scratch in their SoHo kitchen, with no preservatives. When a new client is taken on, their first order of business is meeting with a registered dietician to do intake, establishing a meal plan that adapts to his or her medical regimen, ability to ingest, and personal preferences. Some meals are served minced or pureed. ""We want to make a sick person better, or at least experience the best quality of life that they can,"" Ludwigson said. For this year's Outsider Art Fair, 15 art galleries have donated works for a silent auction, with all proceeds benefitting GLWD. Artists and the arts community, Ludwigson explained, have long been major supporters of GLWD's mission. Not to mention that art has wiggled its way into the GLWD formula. For example, every holiday season clients receive their meals in a white bag decorated by a New York City student, whether a four-year-old or a high schooler. And then there's the food itself. ""Art shows up in the food we deliver,"" Findley said. ""An artist we deliver to said, 'Tell your volunteers these are works of art.' We want to make food that is beautiful.""Ludwigson offered up another connection between the mission of GLWD and that of outsider art. ""When you think of the people who started GLWD, I don’t think it’s that different than being an outsider artist. They weren’t trained in providing food service. It was something they were passionate about and wanted, needed to do.""Both Ludwigson and Findley look forward to meeting potential new volunteers and donors at the Outsider Art Fair. But just as much, they hope to spread knowledge of their organization to those who need it most.""There’s not a waiting list,"" Findley said. ""There never has been, never will be. That message is just as important.""Learn more about God's Love We Deliver at the Outsider Art Fair, from Jan. 21-24, 2016, at the Metropolitan Pavilion in New York City.Also on HuffPost:"

But the audience wasn't having it, making the real estate mogul pause after a sustained round of boos went up in the chamber.Asked why he was questioning Cruz's U.S. citizenship at this point in the race, Trump flatly admitted that it was because of the growing threat Cruz now poses to the businessman's presidential prospects.""Because now he’s doing a little bit better.

According to CBS DFW, the two mansions can fit about four families between the two properties and tenants would have to pay just $1 a month. The first family -- single mother Catherine Jenkins and her daughter, Amber, who is quadriplegic -- moved into one of the mansions last week. ""It is just overwhelming. We're going to be so happy just to be able to rest finally,"" Catherine, whose house in Garland, Texas, was completely destroyed in the tornado, told NBC DFW. ""This is beyond anything I ever dreamed.""Sturgeon, who had left the country on vacation a day after the storms hit, said that he felt compelled to take action after seeing images of the devastation on the news. ""When I saw the news I realized that I'm so blessed to have these two huge homes sitting vacant -- one of them is completely furnished,"" Sturgeon told NBC DFW. ""And I wanted to do something.""So the millionaire wrote a Facebook post, initially just offering to lend one of his homes, which was up for sale. Sturgeon soon added a second home so more families could get shelter. He explained that families are able to stay in the homes for at least three months and can even use the storage space. According to CBS DFW, candidates need to go through a background check, verify their house was destroyed by the tornado and have a credit score of 700 or higher. Sturgeon chose the Jenkins family as a recipient of his offer because their story resonated with him. ""They’ve obviously been through a lot in their life already,"" Jennifer Knittle, Sturgeon's assistant, told CBS DFW. ""The only thing they salvaged was possibly their entertainment center.""Without having to worry about a place to stay, the Jenkinses will be able to focus on getting Amber the medical help she needs. ""I need to get started on trying to find a new van for her,"" Catherine told NBC DFW. ""We have to call and get her wheelchair fixed because it was damaged in the tornado, and I haven't had any time to be able to make calls on that.""The millionaire told NBC DFW that he's experienced his own challenges, which has made giving back all the more meaningful. ""My dad died when I was a senior in high school and I was left all alone,"" Sturgeon said. ""I've been homeless. I lived in a mobile home for a really, really long time. I'm self-made, and so it is a special thing for me to be able to help such a deserving family.""Sturgeon is still accepting applications for his offer.

Rick Snyder (R) called on the Obama administration Thursday night to declare an emergency over Flint's water situation. A spokeswoman for the Federal Emergency Management Agency told HuffPost on Friday that Snyder's request was under review. “We’ve been actively engaged with the State of Michigan as it works to resolve the water issues in Flint,"" the spokeswoman said, noting that FEMA was already helping based on an earlier Snyder request to help coordinate federal agencies responding to the crisis. Since October, Flint residents have been advised not to drink the brown stuff coming out of their taps, which they had previously been assured was safe even though it looked funny and caused rashes. The state admitted it made a mistake, and contributed to a public health emergency, when a local pediatrician reported unusually high lead levels in Flint children's blood. Earnest said the federal government has already taken a number of steps to help with the situation, including providing bottled water and deploying FEMA personnel to Flint to serve as liaisons between local and federal officials. The Environmental Protection Agency will be assessing the impact of the contamination on the community, and the Justice Department is looking at ""the decisions that led to this,"" he said.Deadly neurotoxins contaminated the city's water after an emergency manager appointed by Snyder oversaw the city's switch from the Detroit water system to the Flint River, a decision city officials supported at the time. The state failed to ensure the city treated its new water for corrosion, and the new water wound up leaching lead from the city's pipes. The EPA was aware of the lack of corrosion control and potentially high lead levels last year but stood by as state and local officials downplayed concerns. Earnest wouldn't say whether the EPA screwed up.""At this point, I'm quite limited in what I can say about attributing any sort of blame for this particular situation, primarily because the Department of Justice is taking a look at this question,"" he said.

Al Sharpton blasted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for its blatant lack of diversity in this year's nominations.“Hollywood is like the Rocky Mountains, the higher up you get the whiter it gets and this year’s Academy Awards will be yet another Rocky Mountain Oscars,” Sharpton said in a statement provided by the National Action Network. “Yet again, deserving black actors and directors were ignored by the Academy -- which reinforces the fact that there are few if any blacks with real power in Hollywood. Being left out of awards consideration is about more than just recognition for a job well-done; winning an Oscar has long-lasting cultural and economic impacts.”Sharpton's comments weren't the first time he addressed the diversity problem in Hollywood. In 2014, after a leaked racist email exchange between then-Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman Amy Pascal and a Hollywood producer were exposed, Sharpton met with Pascal to discuss plans to bring equality to the film industry.Next month, Sharpton and the National Action Network intend to call out studios and film industry leaders “who aren’t living up to their obligations,” during a Hollywood SummitThe group’s Los Angeles chapter is also urging viewers to boycott the Oscar’s Feb. 28, telecast in an effort to impact the show’s ratings and advertising interest, according to the chapter’s political director Najee Ali.“The lack of African Americans and women excluded from the major categories of Oscar nominees is appalling,” Ali said in a statement to The Wrap. “Cheryl Boone Issacs, the African-American president of the academy, is nothing but a pawn, and the black face of Hollywood’s system and culture that is racist, sexist and lacks true diversity.”The 88 annual Academy Awards, hosted by Chris Rock, will air live on ABC on Feb. 28.Also on HuffPost:"

Plus a look at all the latest polling in Iowa and New Hampshire.,2016-01-15,Bernie Sanders could win big in New Hampshire... or maybe not. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5698efa91a00005a00ab0a35.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Nate Silver’s primary election forecasts highlight just how uncertain the outcomes are this time. A boom of polling in Iowa and New Hampshire shows some very close races for both parties. And most Republicans are okay with Ted Cruz’s Canadian birth, but many still doubt Obama’s eligibility. This is HuffPollster for Friday, January 15, 2016DESPITE CHALLENGES, FIVETHIRTYEIGHT IS FORECASTING THE PRIMARIES - Nate Silver: “Forecasting primaries and caucuses is challenging, much more so than general elections. Polls shift rapidly and often prove to be fairly inaccurate, even on the eve of the election….And races with several viable candidates, like the one the Republicans are contesting this year, are especially hard to predict. Nonetheless, we’ve developed a pair of relatively simple statistical models that we hope can shed some light on the upcoming primaries. These models don’t claim to have a lot of precision, sometimes showing very wide potential ranges of results for each candidate.” [538]Two different models sometimes predict very different outcomes. - Silver describes two models: One using only state-level polling data -- “polls only” -- and the other using state polling data plus endorsements and national polling data -- “polls plus.” According to the polls-only forecast in Iowa, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are neck-and-neck with a 44 percent and 42 percent chance of winning the caucus. Incorporating the other factors bumps Cruz to a 51 percent chance of winning and drops Trump to 29 percent. In New Hampshire, Trump has either a 57 percent chance of winning in the polls only model or a 39 percent chance in the polls plus. On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton goes from a 66 percent chance of winning the Iowa caucuses in the polls only model to an 82 percent chance in the polls plus model. Bernie Sanders has either a 72 percent chance (polls only) of winning New Hampshire or a 43 percent chance (polls-plus). [538] What to make of widely varying forecasts? The uncertainty in these forecasts highlights Silver’s point that forecasting primary elections is very difficult. Relying on polling data is much more problematic in primaries than in general elections because primary polls are more volatile and less accurate than general election polls. Additionally, there are widely varying numbers of polls across different states -- and some states’ primary elections have no polling at all. In the 2012 GOP primary, only 21 states had polling data available. Nine of those had fewer than 10 polls. And in Iowa, South Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Texas the polls pointed toward the wrong outcome. In 2016 it’s likely that many states will again have little or no polling, and there will probably be at least a few polling misses. Combine the volatility or absence of state-level polls with the striking differences in the two models Silver has created, and it’s clear no one knows what to expect.HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - Get the latest polling updates in your inbox every Friday morning!

Polls released by NBC/WSJ, Bloomberg/Selzer/DMR and PPP show Clinton maintaining a slight lead of 2-4 points. At the same time, releases from ARG and Quinnipiac show Sanders up. The variance is likely partly explained by differences in methodology. But overall, the race has closed: Clinton is holding on to about 46 percent of the vote and Sanders has surged to 42 percent, according to the HuffPost Pollster aggregate.Bernie Sanders maintains lead in New Hampshire: Sanders holds an advantage over Clinton in all four of the polls released this week, although that advantage ranges from as little as 3 points in an ARG poll to 14 points in a Monmouth poll. According to the HuffPost Pollster aggregate, Sanders has 50 percent of the vote while Clinton trails with 44 percent. [NBC/WSJ/Marist, Fox, Monmouth, ARG] GOP DEAD HEAT IN IOWA - Ted Cruz and Donald Trump are battling it out for the lead in the Iowa polls. According to the HuffPost Pollster aggregate, the two are tied at about 28 percent of the vote. This week’s poll releases ranged from a 3-4 point lead for Cruz to a similar margin in Trump's favor. Marco Rubio is the only other candidate averaging double digits with about 13 percent. A majority of Iowa caucus goers are still making up their minds, so there could be further upheaval in the next two weeks. [NBC/WSJ/Marist, Fox, Quinnipiac, ARG, Bloomberg/Selzer/DMR, PPP] Trump continues to dominate New Hampshire polls. In the five polls released this week, Trump has an advantage that ranges from 11 points to 20 points. According to the HuffPost Pollster aggregate, he has 29 percent of support in the state. Marco Rubio is second with 14 percent, Ted Cruz is in third with 12 percent and Chris Christie and John Kasich are stuck just behind with 11 percent. [PPP, NBC/WSJ/Marist, Fox, Monmouth, ARG] REPUBLICANS STILL AREN'T CONVINCED OBAMA IS AMERICAN, BUT HAVE NO QUALMS WITH TED CRUZ'S CANADIAN CITIZENSHIP - HuffPollster: ""Donald Trump famously questioned President Barack Obama's citizenship in 2011 and demanded he publicly release his birth certificate. Now, Trump's at it again, this time questioning the citizenship of Canadian-born Republican presidential rival Ted Cruz. A new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds that 53 percent of Republicans still doubt Obama's citizenship. At the same time, an overwhelming 70 percent don't have any doubt Cruz is American and eligible to be president. More interestingly, most of the Republicans who don't think Obama was born in America aren't concerned about Cruz's citizenship. Sixty-four percent think Cruz is eligible to become president, while just 18 percent think he's not. Another 18 percent are not sure. [HuffPost] WHY EARLY POLLING STILL MATTERS - Lee Miringoff: ""Poll Watcher Season is upon us big time. And, with it comes both the good and the bad. Each election cycle resurrects some oldies about the failings of public polls and typically ushers in a few new critiques. Expect 2016 to follow the same pattern….Pre-election polls are not predictive even though many continue to treat them that way. Common sense tells us that a poll conducted substantially before voting cannot be predictive. Without pre-election polls, we would be clueless about the surprising and lasting electoral appeal of Donald Trump….Public polls help us understand the emergence and decline of different candidates and also let the public in on the secret that campaign pollsters and strategists see in their private poll data.

RYOT News, created by humanitarian aid workers Bryn Mooser and David Darg, aims to be different. The company wants to encourage its audience to do something about what it reads.Alongside familiar icons for Twitter and Facebook, RYOT News' articles all feature a ""Take Action"" button, giving readers a chance to do just that -- whether it means signing a petition, making a donation or volunteering.The company has also partnered with The Associated Press and other organizations to release a number of virtual reality films and documentaries, including ""Body Team 12,"" which was recently nominated for an Oscar for best documentary short. It also recently released ""The Crossing,"" which chronicled the refugee crisis in Greece in partnership with The Huffington Post and Susan Sarandon.As part of HuffPost's ""Digital Dive"" series, we spoke to RYOT News co-founder Bryn Mooser to learn more about his company's projects and mission.What is RYOT News?RYOT is an immersive media company. We reach over 100 million young people a month and tell stories of what's happening in the world and what you can do about it. Every story at RYOT has an action and a way for people to get involved in the world.What led you to create RYOT? How did the idea first come about?David and I were humanitarian aid workers and wanted to use story to change the world. Media and news is often so cynical and shallow. As technology connects us all over the world, why should news still be a one-way flow of information?How did you come up with the name RYOT?RYOT is a Hindi word that means ""peasant."" We used this term because we wanted to help build a platform that could help elevate voices often unheard. We also love the Martin Luther King Jr. quote where he says that ""a riot is the language of the unheard.""What film would you say you're most proud of?We are very excited that our film ""Body Team 12"" was just nominated for an Oscar for best documentary short. This is an important film for us because it highlights the brave work of the body-collecting teams in Liberia during the Ebola outbreak.How can using virtual reality tell a story differently than 2D video? What value does VR add?VR is the most significant shift in media since the mobile phone. It is changing how we think of video and journalism. VR brings you inside the story as never before and opens up the whole world in 360 degrees.How has VR technology changed the way you tell a story?It is just the start to how VR will change media and storytelling. It's a mobile-first technology, so everyone with a smartphone has the power to play 360-degree video in their pocket.Where do you see the future of the news industry going? How has traditional media failed in the past, and looking forward, what is RYOT doing to fix this problem?News is already decentralized. Distribution is democratized, and with mobile phone penetration in the world, storytelling will be democratized. We won't need a news anchor and huge news crew to go to the field and tell us what's happening when we can have local people tell their own stories in their own voices.Where do you see VR technology going in the future? VR is the future of storytelling. It has changed the way we think of video and opened up whole new worlds for us to explore and be immersed in.Is VR the last frontier for storytelling? Do you think there are other tools to tell stories that haven't been adequately used yet?VR is just the next step. It's a gateway to augmented reality, and that will be a gateway to whatever comes next. The world is changing so fast. We all better hold on tight and be nimble and iterate and calibrate to stay ahead. The future of media is for the small, focused media brands. The titans will be in trouble if they don't start swimming fast.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.

Conventional wisdom, 2015: Hillary Clinton will win the Democratic nomination in a cakewalk.Everybody knows what happened to the conventional wisdom once 2007 turned to 2008. Certainly Clinton does. This time around, even as she amassed advantages that may still prove insurmountable, her campaign put forth a strong message: ""We get it. We’ve changed.""But after a promising start, Clinton's campaign has taken an abrupt, confused, strategic turn. And a familiar crassness has returned to a campaign that now appears to be bent on ensuring a repeat of 2008 in 2016.On this week’s edition of “So, That Happened,” we grapple with how this came to be. The discussion begins at the 19:45 mark. Recent polling suggests her rival for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), is not only ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire, but is neck-and-neck, perhaps even ahead, in Iowa. That these early states are shaping up as competitive shouldn’t be a shock to anyone. Voters break late -- many aren't paying close attention until a few weeks before their state's contest.And yet, Clinton has responded to the adversity by doing, frankly, what Clintons always tend to do -- going on the attack. That’s not necessarily a bad thing, as long as those attacks make sense in the context of a Democratic primary. What Clinton has come up with, however, is strategic madness.Perhaps the most astounding mistake Clinton has made, in recent days, is the way she’s gone about competing with Sanders on the issue of health care. Sanders favors a single-payer, Medicare-for-all system. Clinton would prefer to make incremental expansions to Obamacare.But instead of convincing voters that she’d be the more politically effective candidate in this situation, Clinton’s gone all the way 'round the bend and has decided to ramp up unnecessary fearmongering, dispatching her daughter to New Hampshire to darkly warn that Sanders is gonna take everyone’s health care away:""Sen. Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the CHIP program, dismantle Medicare, and dismantle private insurance,"" she said during a campaign stop in New Hampshire. ""I worry if we give Republicans Democratic permission to do that, we'll go back to an era -- before we had the Affordable Care Act -- that would strip millions and millions and millions of people off their health insurance.""Hillary Clinton herself doubled down on her daughter's comments on ABC News Thursday morning, and campaign aides have done the same. Of course, this is not true. Under a single-payer system, everybody gets health care. That's the entire point, as Hillary Clinton well knows. Chelsea Clinton knows it too. As Alex Pareene points out: ""Chelsea Clinton has a masters degree in public health from Columbia. She knows exactly how what she’s saying obfuscates the issue.""This is well beyond the level of vitriol that is needed in the primary. More importantly, it's stupid. The Democratic Party has been advocating for a single-payer health care system since the Truman era. Hillary Clinton herself said in 1994 that a single-payer system was all-but politically inevitable, and advocated making Medicare available to all Americans in 2008. Politicians don't win races by trying to pull the wool over their potential supporters' eyes about core policy beliefs they have held for decades.But Clinton's cynical, dishonest assault on single-payer is consistent with the weird, sinister turn her campaign made at the outset of 2016. Earlier this month, Clinton attempted to smear Sanders as being soft on Wall Street, suggesting that he doesn’t have a plan to take on ""shadow banking."" This is daffy any way you look at it. As we’ve noted before, Sanders favors aggressively breaking up the large financial institutions that engage in shadow banking. He would buttress those efforts by reinstating Glass-Steagall and hit those shadow banks that remain unaffected with a tax on their transactions.Since the crisis, financial reform advocates have worked to make ""break up the banks"" the core Democratic Party message on Wall Street. Pretending that the guy who is tough on ""too big to fail"" is weak on Wall Street doesn't really register with anyone outside the class of former and potential Clinton advisers.This is not a battle of ideas; it’s an investment in cynicism. And it's hard to avoid a few ugly conclusions. Clinton has not learned from the mistakes of 2008. She does not understand the Democratic Party's base. She does not respect the activists and intellectuals who have fought to establish the party's economic policy agenda over the past 50 years. And she thinks voters in early primary states are dumb enough to fall for obvious dishonesty, just because they already like her.The truth is that Clinton has a solid set of prescriptives on both health care and shadow banking. But here's a hard truth: No Democratic president is going to be able to enact any version of his or her policy agenda with a Republican Congress. Either Sanders or Clinton will be playing defense on Obama's legacy for at least one term in office. There is almost no chance of actual liberal legislating before 2020.The Democratic primary is two things. One, an authenticity contest, in which Clinton and Sanders try to show die-hard Democrats that they are really, really like them -- even though both are career politicians. Two, a statement of the party's purpose. Here is the dream, even if it can't be enacted anytime soon.Clinton's recent domestic policy offensive fails on both fronts. Nobody really believes that a woman who served on the board of Walmart when her husband was governor of Arkansas and who made millions of dollars giving speeches to big banks and private equity firms is a populist Democrat. And nobody really believes that a woman who previously advocated a Medicare-for-all plan thinks single-payer will destroy Medicare. Party activists also don't believe that her incrementalism is more legislatively plausible, because no actual Democratic efforts are going to be possible for years to come.Democrats like Clinton because she has been fighting outrageous Republican attacks for more than 20 years. She's still got it (see: Benghazi hearings), and it's Democratic primary gold (see: post-Benghazi-hearing polls). That's Clinton's best argument for the nomination. Smearing policy proposals that Democrats have spent years fighting for? Not so much.CORRECTION: This article previously stated incorrectly that Clinton worked to establish a single-payer system in 1993. Her plan was an alternative to a single-payer system, which she viewed as politically inevitable without private-sector reforms.Also on HuffPost:"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) must really get Bill O'Reilly's Irish up.The blustery talk show host has promised to move to Ireland if Sanders, who is running for president as a Democrat, gets elected.O'Reilly made the threat on Thursday's night's ""O'Reilly Factor"" after arguing that Sanders wants to “dismantle” Medicare and the Affordable Care Act “in the sense that it would be Berniecare and it would be much more than it is now.” “If Bernie Sanders gets elected president, I’m fleeing,"" O'Reilly said. ""I’m going to Ireland. And they already know it.”O'Reilly went on to speculate that simply by making such a declaration, he might be handing a victory to Sanders.“I shouldn’t say it publicly because that will get Sanders more votes,"" he said. ""But I’m not going to pay 90 percent of my income to that guy. I’m sorry. I’m not doing it.”Threatening to leave the country if something doesn't go your way is a popular way for celebrities and non-celebrities alike to express their displeasure (and, occasionally, to shoulder their way into the news cycle for five seconds).Other famous folk who've made similar vows include Eddie Vedder, who said he'd move away if George W. Bush was elected in 2000, and Stephen Baldwin, who promised to leave in 2008 if Barack Obama was elected.Spoiler alert: They're still here. (In Vedder's case, technically you could argue that Bush didn't get elected in 2000.)Alec Baldwin reportedly said he'd move in 2000 if Bush was elected, but later denied making that statement.Currently, Jon Stewart, Cher, Rosie O'Donnell and Samuel L. Jackson have all threatened to leave the country if Donald Trump becomes president.Also on HuffPost:"

Jerry McDonald, Sgt. Tina Sheppard and officer Arthur Gatlin Jr. arrived at the scene to bring Armstrong back to the hospital.The officers first tried to talk to Armstrong, but he was acting erratically, eating grass and dandelions and putting cigarettes out on his tongue while the officers waited for the commitment order. He was also straying close the busy highway.Once the papers were complete, the three officers surrounded Armstrong, who by then had sat down on the ground and wrapped himself around a post. They tried to pry his arms and legs free, but he was holding on too tightly. Two police officers joined them, and Armstrong's sister was standing nearby.Within moments of the commitment order being finalized, the complaint said, Officer Gatling drew his Taser and warned Armstrong that if he didn't let go of the post, the device would be used on him. Armstrong refused, and Gatling Tased him five separate times over a period of just two minutes.The other officers joined in the struggle, and finally were successful in prying Armstrong from the post, laying him face down on the ground.During the struggle, Armstrong said he was being choked, but no independent witness saw the police apply any chokeholds. Lopez said she saw the officers ""pull his collar like they were choking him,"" during the struggle, the Fourth Circuit's ruling said.The officers applied handcuffs and shackled his legs, the ruling continued. At this point, he was no longer moving. Lopez was the first to notice that her brother was unresponsive. The officers turned him over and saw that his skin had turned a bluish color, and he didn't appear to be breathing.They administered CPR, and he was transported to the emergency room where he was pronounced dead shortly after admission. Just six and a half minutes had elapsed between the dispatch advising the police officers that Armstrong's commitment papers were final and their radioing for Emergency Medical Services.Lopez sued the police officers for use of excessive force in violation of Armstrong's Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. Judge Eagles ruled that ""it is highly doubtful that the evidence establishes a constitutional violation at all, but assuming it does, the defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.""Qualified immunity protects officers who commit constitutional violations but who, in light of clearly established law, could reasonably believe that their actions were lawful.Two inquiries must be made to establish qualified immunity: that the plaintiff has had his constitutional rights violated and whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation.The court determined that Armstrong's constitutional rights were violated because he was no danger to anyone but himself. While some force was justified because he was not complying with police orders and they needed to prevent him from running into the street where he could have hurt others, excessive force was not warranted.Writing for the Fourth Circuit panel, U.S. Circuit Judge Stephanie Thacker agreed.""The degree of force necessary to prevent an individual who is affirmatively refusing to move from fleeing is obviously quite limited,"" Thacker wrote. ""Immediately Tasing a non-criminal, mentally ill individual, who seconds before had been conversational, was not a proportional response.""The panel felt the officers could have eventually seized Armstrong without Tasing him. This use of force was excessive and in violation of Armstrong's rights, it said.However, panel upheld the lower court's grant of summary judgment in the officers' favor because they were entitled to qualified immunity, which is based on the fact the officers did not understand at the time that they were violating his rights.Thacker wrote that the officers ""were treading close to the constitutional line,"" but they did not continue to use force after Armstrong was secured, and they did give him prior warning.Given established cases that allow for force in non-violent situations, the officers ""did not have sufficiently clear guidance to forfeit qualified immunity,"" she wrote.The court recognized that use of Tasers in non-violent situations is evolving, which is why qualified immunity is available. However, the panel warned, ""This ought not to remain an evolving field of law indefinitely.""In order to avoid greater ""deteriorative creep,"" Thacker offered some further guidance, particularly that a Taser ""may only be deployed when a police officer is confronted with an exigency that creates an immediate safety risk and that is reasonably likely to be cured by using the Taser.""The subject of a seizure does not create such a risk simply because he is doing something that can be characterized as resistance - even when that resistance includes physically preventing an officer's manipulations of his body,"" she continued. ""Erratic behavior and mental illness do not necessarily create a safety risk either. To the contrary, when a seizure is intended solely to prevent a mentally ill individual from harming himself, the officer effecting the seizure has a lessened interest in deploying potentially harmful force.""""Where, during the course of seizing an out-numbered mentally ill individual who is a danger only to himself, police officers choose to deploy a Taser in the face of stationary and non-violent resistance to being handcuffed, those officers use unreasonably excessive force. While qualified immunity shields the officers in this case from liability, law enforcement officers should now be on notice that such Taser use violates the Fourth Amendment,"" Thacker wrote.This story was originally published by Courthouse News."

This week, President Barack Obama delivered his final State of the Union address. He was immediately followed by South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who shouldered the responsibility of delivering the Republican Party's official rebuttal. Amid all the back-and-forth between opposition parties, there was one thing everyone seemed to agree on: Donald Trump is bad for America.That was certainly the part of the night that our guest, Rep. Reid Ribble (R-Wisc.), admired the most. We chatted with Ribble about the oddly unified front presented by the two orators, and got an inside-the-room perspective of what it's like to be a member of Congress at one of these addresses -- and how to distinguish the pomp from the possible. Ribble also offered his best advice for anyone who gets asked to deliver a rebuttal: Maybe don't!  Meanwhile, another GOP debate is in the books, as the remnants of the party establishment fight to preserve their bid against the firebrands currently dominating the race. And what of those two firebrands? Will Donald Trump successfully paint Ted Cruz as... Canadian? Your Huffington Post team is in full effect with post-debate analysis. Finally, here's a phrase you may have heard if you've been tuning in to the Democratic debates: ""Reinstall Glass-Steagall.""

But to be 100 percent sure, we'll check in with Alexis Goldstein from Americans for Financial Reform.

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is ineligible to run for president, citing his Canadian birth.The case, lodged Thursday by Texas attorney Newton B. Schwartz Sr., says Cruz is ineligible to run as he isn't a ""natural born citizen,"" Bloomberg reported. Cruz was born in Canada to an American citizen.“This 229-year question has never been pled, presented to or finally decided by or resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court,” Schwartz says in his complaint.Schwartz has requested the U.S. Supreme Court expedite the case ahead of the Iowa caucuses and told Bloomberg he was surprised Cruz didn't file a case himself to avoid any complications.The issue became heated during this week's GOP debate after a moderator asked Cruz about Donald Trump's accusations that the senator may be constitutionally prohibited from presidential office.""Back in September, my friend Donald said he had his lawyers look at this from every which way and there was no issue there,"" Cruz replied. ""There was nothing to this birther issue. Now, since September, the Constitution hasn't changed, but the poll numbers have.""A similar debate took place nearly 50 years ago over the eligibility of George Romney, former Michigan governor and father of Mitt Romney, to run for president. George Romney was also born to U.S. citizens living outside the country. Mitt Romney recently tweeted in support of Cruz, citing his father's case.There may be no more infamous birther controversy than the one that dogged President Barack Obama, who was actually forced to release his birth certificate to shut down rumors he was born outside the United States.

""We believe such a revolution is not only possible but necessary.""The progressive magazine's nod is the latest in a string of progressive endorsements for Sanders. He also has nabbed support from MoveOn.org, the Working Families Party and Democracy for America. Sanders has gained on rival Hillary Clinton in early voting states. In New Hampshire, the Vermont senator is ahead of the former secretary of state in several polls, while Iowa surveys show Clinton's lead over Sanders decreasing. Meanwhile, Clinton's campaign has started to openly attack Sanders, criticizing his votes on guns as well as his health care position.The Nation, which describes itself as ""the flagship of the left,"" endorsed President Barack Obama in the last two general elections. During the 2008 Democratic primary, the magazine's editors praised Dennis Kucinich, then a congressman, as the candidate most in line with the publication's values.

It includes federal laws that would secure 12 weeks of paid leave to care for a newborn or loved one; more than double the federal minimum wage, from $7.25 to $15 per hour; increase penalties for employers that bust unions; and make it easier for women to sue over pay discrimination.The ideas aren't exactly new, and O'Malley's rivals, front-runner Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), are already on record supporting several of them. But Sean Savett, a spokesman for the O'Malley campaign, said no one in the race has put out such a comprehensive agenda on workplace issues to date. ""No other candidate has laid out in such detail the specific actions they would take to strengthen workers' rights and increase wages -- beyond vague, big-picture ideas or Republican-lite proposals,"" Savett said in an email. O'Malley's agenda piggybacks on a number of progressive Democratic proposals that have been stymied in a GOP Congress, such as the Paycheck Fairness Act, the Schedules That Work Act and the $15 minimum wage proposal introduced by Sanders. It also voices support for a pair of executive actions pursued by the Obama White House -- the overtime expansion, which will extend time-and-a-half pay to millions of Americans once it's enacted, and the fiduciary rule, which will crack down on 401(k) fees. Neither has gone into effect.Less than three weeks out from the Iowa caucuses, O'Malley is still polling in the low single digits, according to HuffPost Pollster. His campaign has struggled to find traction as Clinton and Sanders increasingly take shots at one another on the trail. The former secretary of state leads the Vermont independent nationally by 14 points in an aggregation of polls.All three candidates have been seeking the backing of labor unions, a constituency O'Malley may hope to woo with his new worker platform. Most of the major national unions have already broken for Clinton, including the largest public-sector unions in the country. The most coveted labor endorsement -- from the AFL-CIO union federation -- has not been announced yet.O'Malley's full proposals can be read here.More on HuffPost:"
