He was born April 21, 1838.In its obituary of Muir, dubbed the ""apostle of the wild,"" the Times wrote that America had lost “perhaps its greatest naturalist” and the world “one its most remarkable nature poets.” (Read the obituary here.)This isn’t the first time that a newspaper has issued a correction decades later. Last year, The New York Times issued a correction for misspelling the name of Solomon Northup, the black man whose memoirs inspired the Oscar-winning film “12 Years A Slave.” The mistake had been made more than 160 years before in an article published in 1853."

Led by Father Alejandro Solalinde -- head of the Pastoral of Human Mobility of the Mexican Episcopacy -- the group hoped to draw attention to Mexico's new ""Frontera Sur"" program, which cracks down on Central American immigration into Mexico from its southern border.But what started as a peaceful protest has grown into a raging controversy -- over the fate of the migrating protestors and the safety of all of Mexico's migrants at large. Using violence and intimidation, the Mexican government attempted to quell the protest before its arrival in the capital. Earlier this month, the authorities trapped the group in Father Solalinde's shelter in Oaxaca for over a week. Surrounding the shelter, federal authorities claimed they would deport all of the migrants inside and arrest the local activists for human trafficking. Defiant, the group decided to follow through with its journey to Mexico City, confronting police brutality and a stream of threats along the way.The controversy marks a new era in North American immigration control. Through the Frontera Sur program, the United States has successfully outsourced elements of its border control to Mexico, as the Mexican federal government picks up that mission with vigor. ""Mexico is expelling its migrants,"" said Father Solalinde last Tuesday. ""This government is doing the dirty work for the United States.""The traveling migrants are part of the fifth annual Viacrucis Migrante -- or the ""Stages of the Cross Migration."" Organized by a small group of local activists, the Viacrucis is a walking pilgrimage from the town of Tecún Umás, at the tip of Guatemala, to Ixtepec, Oaxaca -- 268 miles in total. Along the way, the organizers invited local undocumented migrants to join the march, set to culminate with a visit to Mexico City, where they would seek formal asylum from the Mexican government.Back in Guatemala, the march began with only its three organizers. But it grew steadily as it moved through Mexico. ""They relied on word of mouth to grow in numbers,"" says Levi Vonk, an anthropologist from the University of Sussex, who made the full pilgrimage alongside the Viacrucis organizers. ""Every night, they stopped at different albergues,"" or migrant shelters, ""and told local migrants how the Viacrucis could help them, what kind of services they could offer them.""The majority of migrants living in the migrant shelters of Southern Mexico are refugees from Central America. Most are fleeing local violence in countries like Honduras. Some are pursuing economic opportunities in Mexico and beyond. The shelters provide shelter and food as migrants regain their footing or prepare to travel onwards.Trekking through the Southern state of Chiapas, new groups began to emerge to join the group. ""We would be walking down the road, and all of a sudden, groups of five, or ten, or twenty people would join us,"" says Vonk. ""The numbers began to swell."" They carried signs like ""Jesus was a migrant"" and charged through local immigration checkpoints with the power of their numbers. By the time they reached Father Solalinde's shelter in Oaxaca, well over 300 migrants had joined the ranks.The pilgrimage is a direct response to Mexico's new iron-fisted immigration policy known as ""Frontera Sur."" Following the border crisis of July 2014 -- in which thousands of Central American children arrived at the American border -- Congress renewed its effort to coordinate with Mexico to prevent border-crossings. By July, President Enrique Peña Nieto announced the Frontera Sur program, adding muscle and new resources to Mexico's migration patrol along its southern border with Guatemala. ""We are now the servants of the United States,"" noted Sergio Aguayo, a prominent Mexican academic, at the time.Today, authorities are implementing Frontera Sur program with an iron fist. Over 30,000 Central American migrants have been deported since the launch of the new initiative. For those that remain, life is in the shadows. Migrants must avoid buses and trains where formal documentation is requested, and they must dodge encounters with local immigration checkpoints. Instead, they often travel at night, walking through difficult terrain on their journey North.To emphasize these new hardships, the pilgrimage organizers decided to walk on foot. Previous pilgrimages had used vans to transport migrants through the Viacrucis. But, as the crackdown of Frontera Sur has made these public transport options unavailable, pilgrims walked the entire way up from Guatemala. And through the slow, weeks-long journey, they began to attract international attention to their cause, putting pressure on Mexico's immigration office to bend the rules and provide asylum to the traveling migrants. When they arrived at Father Salolinde's shelter in Oaxaca, however, Mexican immigration forces moved quickly to end the pilgrimage. Officers surrounded the shelter, preventing migrants from exiting the premises. Meanwhile, the government sent threats to the Viacrucis organizers. Anyone that transported the migrants, they claimed, would be arrested for human trafficking.In response, Father Solalinde, with the help of Amnesty International, castigated the Frontera Sur program and the measures taken against the traveling migrants. ""This is not a [legal] program because it violates the human rights of the undocumented,"" announced Solalinde in a local newspaper. ""It is a lie that we are going to bring the migrants to the [U.S.] border."" Amnesty International issued its own statement claiming that the action violates Article 76 of Mexico's Immigration Law, which prohibits the Mexican government from prosecuting immigrants living in local shelters.Following intense but inconclusive negotiations with the federal authorities, Father Solalinde began to make preparations for the migrants' last stop in Mexico City. The migrants would visit the Basilica of Guadalupe -- completing their Viacrucis pilgrimage -- while Solalinde would present a formal complaint at the National Commission of Human Rights for the failure of Mexican authorities to respect the migrants' right to travel freely through the country.Pushing through beatings and threats from local police, the group inched toward Mexico City. The immigration authorities had installed scores of new checkpoints to confront the migrants on their journey. In many cases, those confrontations involved violence and brutality. But the group charged on, eventually acquiring buses to complete their journey to Mexico City. There, they held mass at the Basilica, and filed charges against the federal police for their abuses. Father Solalinde ultimately succeeded in obtaining a temporary injunction, allowing the 300 migrants to move freely in Mexico.Today, the Viacrucis pilgrimage has finished, and its pilgrims have begun to disperse. The controversy, however, continues to rage. On Tuesday, 24 members of the Viacrucis were arrested in Queretaro, a city just outside of Mexico City.

It is also indicative of Mexico's broader role in the containment of northbound immigration.

3,CRIME,Dallas County To Start Confiscating Guns From Domestic Abusers,Andy Campbell,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dallas-county-guns-domestic-abuse_n_7111818.html,,2015-04-22,"DALLAS - JUNE 26: John Sanders of Irving, TX, shoots his glock pistol June 26th at the DFW Gun Range and Training Center in Dallas, Texas. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a ban on handguns in our nation's capitol was a violation of the Second Amendment right to bear arms. (Photo by Rick Gershon/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2b6bc2100003000c656a5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Domestic abuse convicts in Texas are forbidden from possessing firearms under both federal and state law. But until now, there was no system in place to collect those offenders' guns. This month, Dallas County is set to become the first in the state to collect and store weapons taken from domestic abusers, according to local ABC affiliate WFAA. Officials predict that up to 700 guns each year will be taken and stored at a private gun range that volunteered to provide the storage space.County Criminal Court Judge Roberto Cañas, who has been working for months to establish the gun confiscation program, told The Huffington Post that the program should start officially within a week. He got involved with the project because he believed it was unjust for domestic violence offenders to be able to keep their firearms.""I've known we had this hole in our justice system for years,"" Cañas said. ""So I’ve been the cheerleader that says we need to do something about this aspect -- offenders possessing guns.""DFW Gun Range first agreed in June 2014 to participate in the confiscation program. Soon after, county commissioners voted last year to fund and staff the initiative, the Dallas Morning News notes. “Imagine how much better victims would sleep at night knowing all the guns had been removed,” Jan Langbein, CEO of Genesis Women’s Shelter, told the paper after the gun range first signed on. “I think it will save lives. I really do.”Federal law already bans gun possession for those with permanent domestic violence restraining orders. But there are two problems with enforcing that law: First, states that don't have similar rules on the books can't prosecute those who break the federal law. And for those states that do, like Texas, many local jurisdictions don't have a system in place to collect and store the contraband.READ MORE: Why aren't states taking domestic abuse convicts' guns away? ""When I ordered guys that they couldn't have guns anymore, it was pretty much on your honor,"" Cañas told WFAA. ""It's been a gap in the system['s] response to this type of crime.""Cañas has been working with local government officials on the effort, which is known as the ""Firearm Surrender Project,"" and was the one who convinced DFW Gun Range to act as the storage facility.According to WFAA, under the new system Dallas judges will start by asking offenders whether they have guns. If they do, they'll be ordered to surrender the weapons either to the gun range or to a third party who can legally own a gun.Judges will also take steps to double-check whether offenders have concealed carry permits or other records proving that they may own a firearm.Texas has the nation's 16th-highest rate of women killed by men, according to a 2012 Violence Policy Center analysis of homicides involving a single offender and a single victim. Firearms are involved in about 60 percent of domestic violence-related homicides in Texas, WFAA's report noted.On average, three women are killed in domestic homicides every day nationwide. And many of those victims are shot: Guns were responsible for the deaths of more than half of all women killed by their partners between 2001 and 2012."

The Whole Foods outpost signaled its intention to stay open on Good Friday in advance, CTV Ottawa reports. Staff justified the decision to do business on April 3 by arguing that the Lansdowne Park neighborhood of the Canadian capital, where the store is located, is a tourist area exempt from the strictures of the Retail Holidays Business Act. The law, which was passed in 1990, does allow stores in certain designated tourist districts to remain open, but city officials argued that Lansdowne Park has not been recognized as an official tourist area. CBC News reports that when the Whole Foods remained open on April 3, police were called in to investigate and determined that the store's actions were in violation of the law. Ottawa mayor Jim Watson was ""not pleased that Whole Foods decided to just snub their nose at the provincial law,"" he told the Ottawa Sun. Though the managers of the store had originally planned to open up on Easter Sunday as well, they eventually decided to back down and remain closed in light of the city's actions. This week, CBC reported that the police are pressing charges on four counts against the Lansdowne Park Whole Foods. The store faces fines of up to $50,000 Canadian dollars (a little over $40,000 U.S.) or even its entire gross for the day. A court hearing on the matter is scheduled for May 21. For Whole Foods, the affair at least carries a silver lining: According to the CBC, the retailer's landlord now plans to try to get Lansdowne Park designated as an official tourist center. If that proposal succeeds, the location will be allowed to stay open on Good Friday, and Easter, in future years. Whole Foods' corporate offices did not respond to multiple requests for comment. "

LOUIS -- Pine Lawn, a tiny St. Louis County town notorious for corruption and predatory ticketing practices, is being sued by its 80-year-old former mayor, who alleges a successor used the police department to falsely arrest him and portray him as a criminal.Adrian Wright, Pine Lawn mayor from 1993 until 2005, says in a federal lawsuit that ex-Mayor Sylvester Caldwell was the town's de facto police chief and used the force as a political weapon. Caldwell resigned last week when he pleaded guilty to federal extortion charges.Pine Lawn, just over one-half square mile, has about 3,000 residents and shares a reputation with nearby Ferguson for relying on fines and fees to fund local government. The mostly African-American city puts out thousands of arrest warrants for minor code violations, including a ban on saggy pants, that can lead residents into insurmountable debt. “This is a gentleman who served his community, who never had any criminal record, who had never done anything wrong, and found himself the target of the police,” said Jeffrey Mitten, executive director of the ACLU in Missouri, which filed the lawsuit on Wright's behalf. He said Caldwell used police officers as his personal ""bullies."" As for viewing residents more as sources of revenue than citizens to be protected, he added, “Ferguson and Pine Lawn are not alone.” Wright this month won the town's Ward 3 alderperson election. He said he ran because he was concerned about city finances. The city enacted numerous ordinances after he left office that were intended to “raise money,” he said. During the campaign, Wright said, police wrongly accused him of running a stop sign near his home, then arrested him on false assault charges. When he was freed two hours later, he was greeted by a television news crew from station KMOV. Caldwell was with the journalists, Wright said. Later, when Wright endorsed Caldwell’s mayoral opponent in 2013, Caldwell allegedly published Wright’s mugshot in a newspaper he created called The Pine Lawn Evening World, which mimics the region’s weekly crime newspaper, The Evening Whirl.  “The campaign literature falsified me and portrayed me as a criminal,"" Wright said Tuesday. ""They discredited me for running for office because I wouldn’t endorse Caldwell. I hope the police department would rather serve and protect than serve and oppress.""The charges against Wright were dropped because the city failed to prosecute. He was later arrested twice more on the same charges, which were dismissed in August 2013.A Pine Lawn spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment. Caldwell couldn't immediately be reached."

In fact, if you are serious about future-proofing your business, then you not only need to be ready to think outside the box, but to understand this key thought process. That box? You have a team who are dying to assist you in opening it, looking at its design, its hardware, its performance in the marketplace, to show you points about its weaknesses that you may not have been willing to admit to. You have smart, able, brilliant team thinkers who are ready to turn that box into BOX 2.0 and release it to the market as the new must-have in cube shaped containers. Collective or collaborative intelligence on a commercial level is the new currency. Appreciating the value of an 'Intellectual Bank' and what it brings to your business is not just forward-thinking on a theoretical level, it's a bottom line positive as well. As leaders, as colleagues, the opportunity to engage on a team level brings strategic power to an organization or enterprise that is simply not possible with people working on an individual basis -- in the 'me' space. There is no sharing of thoughts, or discussion that leads to development. Move into the 'we' space however -- that space of collaborative team engagement -- and the thought space opens up. Take the example of Apple. Steve Jobs was the visionary; but was he the only big thinker within the company? His death led many to predict that it would take a nosedive in market share and profitability. But Jobs was the first to say that the reason for Apple's success was the strength of the team. As he famously stated '...innovation has nothing to do with how many R & D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R & D. It's not about money. It's about the people you have, how you're led, and how much you get it.'This year saw Apple CEO Tim Cook announce record first quarter profits, and he said '...the execution by our teams to achieve these results was simply phenomenal'. The value of team thought means improvement and innovation. Let's go back to that box. If you were given the 'BOX 2.0' project to work on alone, then chances are it would turn out pretty well. But put a team of big thinkers on it? You have discussion, different skill sets, negotiation on concept and vision. There is engagement on what BOX 2.0 needs to be a success for the company -- and that engagement will lead profitability.The isolation of working alone is endemic in making that bottom line look less a healthy solid black and more of a watery grey. Take your own performance structure as an example. If you are constantly focusing inwards, seeing only what you need to do to achieve your own KPIs and bonus targets, you miss out on banking others' knowledge. It's rapidly becoming apparent that skills are an increasingly valuable commodity for both corporates and entrepreneurs alike. You could for example, suggest to a teammate that you 'swap' a skill for a skill -- teach each other something you previously had no knowledge of. It will stand you in good stead. Collaborative thinking in a team environment also means the ability to effect change. If you think that an idea could be bettered, or that your workplace has unacceptable conditions for members of your team, then as a group you have the ability to use your collective voice. Yes, this may mean collaboration rather than isolation may be uncomfortable in the short term, but the long-term rewards benefit the team rather than the individual.Team or collaborative thinking is all about invention. It's the rationale behind Google, Microsoft, AirbNb. It is fast becoming part of the measure of a company's emotional intelligence. Luckily, it is also becoming part of the measure of that ever-present spectre -- the bottom of the P&L statement."

Maybe squeeze in an hour or two at my on-campus job or do some homework, and then grab a quick lunch and maybe some coffee before I got to job #2. Then I get to spend seven hours there, and when I get home I do homework until who knows when. The next day, I get to wake up tired and do it all over again. Or if I'm lucky and it's the weekend, I can grab an extra shift at work or catch up on the homework I didn't get a chance to do earlier in the week. Somewhere in there I usually try to find the time to spend a few minutes with my friends once or twice a week or at the very least watch some Netflix in order to preserve my sanity. So when my eye started twitching fairly consistently for about week, I was annoyed. I can't be talking to customers or writing an essay if my eye won't stop twitching. The doctor's orders were to ""Get more sleep, drink less caffeine, and alleviate stress."" I actually laughed out loud. How am I supposed to do any of those things? I could quit my job, but then I wouldn't be able to afford my car/gas which gets me to and from work and school. I could drop out, but then I'd need to move back home or work more hours so I could afford to stay in Missouri. And get more sleep? Maybe when they add more hours to the day. And the thing is, I know very few college students who don't have schedules like mine. Even if they're fortunate enough to not have to work, our schedules are loaded with extracurriculars and internships -- anything to pad our resumes for after graduation. Of course we're Generation Stress. We have to be. Without the constant desire to better ourselves -- to make ourselves more competitive -- we graduate with a college degree and no job. We've been brainwashed to compete. There were very few things I did in high school that I did just because I liked them and not because they would ""boost my application."" I was lured into every volunteer opportunity with, ""It will look good on your resume!""Do well in high school so you can do well in college so you can do well in the real world. And don't just do well, do better. So of course I'm stressed. I'm busy for 16 hours a day. I feel like I have to be, or I'm falling behind. We don't celebrate the 20-somethings who move back home after college. We celebrate the ones who work three jobs and volunteer and go to the gym and are able to somehow balance all of those things, as well as some form of social life, without breaking a sweat. I don't even know how to be not busy. Even when I'm doing nothing I'm worrying about what I should be doing. What would I even do with my free time?Honestly, I'd probably sleep for a week."

Unfortunately, it's usually plagued by one negative thought: that it can't become a reality. But many people have turned their dreams into daily realities. How did they get there? What inspires them? Surely they took all the right steps at the exact right time, without suffering any detours. I spoke to a few very successful people working their own ""dream jobs"" hoping to glean some insight. Sundrenched sandy beaches, the sound of cicadas chirping in the trees and the scent of saltwater wafting through the warm island breeze. This idyllic image is the substance of many people's recurring daydreams. But can those daydreams become the basis of a luxury lifestyle brand that's quickly becoming synonymous with the image that inspired it? For the realization of that evolution of the daydream, look no further than Greek born, Switzerland bred, London based designer, Athena Procopiou.""I was always surrounded by creativity and encouraged to develop my own,"" Athena says from her color-filled studio in Chelsea. As a child, she studied classical piano and toured all over Switzerland. Later, History of Art studies at Christie's in Paris ultimately led to graphic design at London's Central St. Martin's. It seems unavoidable that Athena would eventually helm her own brand; and she already had the perfect vision to fulfill.""I've always identified with the well-travelled, free-spirited boho woman who is forever chasing the sun,"" Athena tells me. It's the stuff of any designer's dreams the way her first scarf collection was instantly picked up by some of London's coolest boutiques. Well-deserved, international success quickly followed. ""I absolutely love when a customer tags me on their Instagram photo wearing one of my kimonos while lounging on their super-yacht while cruising around the Mediterranean, or while dancing on a wind-swept sand dune with a pack of Gypsies in the desert!"" she says, earnestly. Her eponymous label has evolved and now also includes glamorous kimonos, boho-chic dresses fit for dancing by a beach bonfire and her latest addition, a covetable swim collection made in some of her most iconic prints. ""My favorite pieces are the ones you can wear during the transition from the beach to sunset. You know, the little sun dresses and sexy fun kimonos which can be thrown over a bathing suit for after beach cocktails, but before you go out for the night?"" I think each and every single item from her collection fits that criteria perfectly and, more often than not, tends to actually inspire many photo ready moments! Illustration by Sara Lee Bentley inspired by Athena Procopiou's ""Dancing In Rio"" kimonoAthena's business strategy has been a major factor in her success. ""I'm growing my business organically -- letting it evolve season to season. I think it's great to plan ahead but not to force it."" Moreover, she always trusts her instincts and turns to them when making important decisions, such as expanding from a scarf brand to a full lifestyle brand. Trusting instincts is also the critical advice Athena offers anyone interested in beginning their own company. ""Every day has its challenge, but in the end it's a wonderful feeling to see something grow organically!"" Another majorly important factor is brand recognition. ""Even though my collections change each season I have several iconic designs which I carry over and incorporate into each collection,"" she shares. ""I use these as a 'common thread' to make my brand stand out. It's important for any new designer to create and maintain their own brand identity."" Despite her careful strategizing, Athena is amazed that in such a short amount of time, her label is carried in some of the best stores worldwide and she has an international clientele. ""It shows that there are boho women all over the world that chase the sun just like me!"" she says, enthusiastically. ""It's fantastic how I have customers from Bali to Bahrain and everywhere in-between."" She attributes some of her success to social media. ""We're so consumed with social networking on a global scale -- the world seems so small on your iPhone! I'm able to use this wonderful platform to sell my dreams, products, lifestyle, brand and aspirations."" Other than working with a great team, a favorite part of her job is when new deliveries arrive at the studio (everything is hand made in Italy) and the finished products look just like she envisioned when designing. But that's not to be taken for granted. ""I find production a very tough part of my job,"" she says. This is especially thanks to Athena's extremely high quality standards. ""I design a luxury brand and the quality of the product needs to match the design. My customer notices the difference between great quality and mediocre quality -- I always have to have the best quality in all my products."" She tells me that the creative process is a constant work in progress; she has to make herself move on when one season is over and start fresh with a new collection. If this all seems slightly overwhelming, she admits that sometimes it is. ""The best way to relieve my stress is through yoga,"" she shares, easily identifying herself with the free-spirited, boho-chic, sun-chasing women she dresses.What's next on the colorful horizon? Other than her new swimwear line, Athena's also working on home furnishings -- fabrics, wallpaper and cushions. ""Ultimately, I would love to have my own bricks-and-mortar flagship shop. But it needs to happen in its own time,"" she says, waiting for her finely tuned instincts to give her the go ahead. Until then, she's looking into pop-up shops in ""various sun-drenched cities"" to test the waters. ""You may find the first Athena Procopiou pop-up shop in Mykonos next summer!"" I'm sure that her customers will be mooring their super-yachts in port and lining up all along the island's winding streets for the occasion. After all, that's what they do in the daydream...

An artists' boycott of a $11 million performing arts center opening Monday in the Jewish settlement of Ariel is giving a new twist to a pressing question, where should Israel's permanent borders run? Leading Israeli playwrights, actors and artists say they will not cross the ""Green Line"", Israel's frontier before it captured the West Bank in 1967, to perform in the new theater in Ariel, an Israeli enclave of 19,000 people. (AP Photo/Ariel Schalit)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb28f73260000360081dbd1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Pulitzer Prize for Drama was given to the writer of a fast and funny and poignant new American play that I had the good fortune to see, Between Riverside and Crazy. The Pulitzer is awarded to a playwright, but I'd argue there should be a citation in there somewhere for the director of the first production. A brand new play comes into the world gestated by a playwright, sometimes for as long as a decade, the ideas growing and developing until they demand to see the light of day. But the midwife whose job it is to insure that the baby comes out alive and kicking is the director. And Stephen Adly Guirgis had the good fortune to have Austin Pendleton in the delivery room.I say that as a playwright myself, and one who has worked with many directors, including (full disclosure) Austin Pendleton, on the first steps of a new play, the early readings. Taking nothing away from the playwright, let's add at least a paragraph about the director to all these articles about the new Pulitzer Prize winning play. Theater is a team sport; surely the actors, and the designers too, get credit for their efforts in the development of a new play. An actor's own speech patterns are suggestive of a new line here, a question from a designer clarifies the plot for the playwright. A lot can happen in the unseen world of new play development that fundamentally alters the course of a play. But most theater professionals would agree that the lion's share of shaping comes in the fertile and sometimes frantic process of a playwright and a director, huddled together after rehearsal, deep in thought and conversation. Directors like Pendleton don't want the credit; they reflect it back on the playwright and modestly demur that they were lucky to be part of it all. But we playwrights know when we get lucky as well. Virtually every review of the show mentioned the terrific direction given in not just one, but two productions of Between Riverside and Crazy just months apart, a rare thing in New York theater history, both productions helmed by Austin Pendleton.Some might argue that the Pulitzer is supposed to be an award purely for the script, unlike the Obies or the Tonys or the Outer Critics Circle Awards, where the prize for Best Play cannot help but be influenced by the production. Everyone in theater understands that seeing a production on stage deeply influences the way the work is perceived, even by a jury of the most scrupulous peers. A bad play with great performances and superb direction sometimes makes it into the winner's circle for numerous awards, but then fails to catch on in subsequent productions. And there are rare cases, such as Nilo Cruz's win for Anna in the Tropics, where the Pulitzer came before the first production. But as a working playwright, I'd argue that even in the case of Anna in the Tropics, the script that is read by the Pulitzer Prize Committee comes with a history of false starts, dropped subplots, and often a whole variety of possible endings that came and went during the process of hearing the play read or in a staged reading, and each of these readings came with a director willing to patiently sit with the writer and go, sometimes word by word and action by action, through a new script. So let's hear it for the playwright Stephen Adly Guirgis, whose imagination, comic timing, sense of pace and diction have given us many fine plays, including his latest, the Pulitzer Prize winning Between Riverside and Crazy. But let's also tip the hat to the director who helped him get there."

Italy on Friday, Oct. 31, 2014 insisted that lives won't be sacrificed as it ends its costly Mediterranean Sea rescue operation and shifts over to a less ambitious joint patrol with the European Union. (AP Photo/Carmelo Imbesi, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14a0c2400003600229f34.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Mediterranean has become a vast forbidding moat -- a death trap -- that separates Fortress Europe from the millions of third world refugees on the other side.The images are appalling: a creaking, ramshackle trawler capsizes, hundreds of passengers trapped in the hull, locked inside by the smugglers; criminally overloaded dinghies sink under the weight of panic-stricken passengers; tormented faces of people who cannot swim hang on to whatever will float, no way to save their screaming children; endless row after row of dripping body bags. But, despite the fact that more than 1,500 migrants have drowned so far this year, the president of Italy warns that one million more are still determined to come. Though the smugglers are mainly operating out of the shattered state of Libya, their human cargo is the product of collapsed or collapsing states that range all the way from Bangladesh to Afghanistan, to across the Middle East and Africa. Huge numbers are escaping the violence and slaughter in Syria, Iraq, Somalia, Libya, Yemen and the Sudan. Others are fleeing collapsed economies, drought, famine, and woefully inept, incredibly corrupt and brutal governments. What is also appalling, however, is that the peoples of Europe -- and most of their leaders -- have done their best to ignore this growing crisis. They've been warned about it for years. Previously the Italians -- most affected by the boatloads from Libya -- attempted to tackle the problem themselves, expanding naval patrols across a wide swathe of the Mediterranean. Last year they rescued scores of ships, saved more than 500 from drowning, and brought more than 130,000 migrants to Italian shores. The Italians asked for help from their European partners, but the consensus was that the Italian program was too successful. It was encouraging ever more migrants to attempt the hazardous passage. Europe's answer was to set up a new diminished program, with a budget just one third the size, far fewer ships, and range of operation. The idea was that once the refugees realized that the voyage to Europe was extremely perilous -- that they and their families wouldn't necessarily be plucked from the seas if their ships foundered -- they'd stop coming. Many who knew the situation well warned that plan was a recipe for tragedy. The refugees would keep on coming, no matter what. Any risk was preferable to the hellish conditions in their homelands.This awful situation and Europe's attempts to ignore it, recall other times when much of the world -- including the United Sates, Canada, and the UK -- closed their doors to most of the millions of Jews desperate to escape the looming Nazi threat in Europe. Some of the scenes from the Mediterranean also parallel the plight of the ""boat people"" who consigned their fate to anything that floated to flee the Communist takeover in Vietnam.The Italians are particularly outraged by the situation. Of the 28 states of Europe, other than Italy, only four -- France, Germany, the UK, Sweden -- have been willing to accept at least some of the refugees.But now, day after day, obliged to watch the heart-rending images on TV, Europeans -- and particularly its leaders -- are forced to acknowledge the catastrophe. And what has quickly become very clear is that the countries of Europe have no unified policy on immigration. Nor are they likely to come up with one in the immediate future. There are too many opposing views.Of course, everyone is for hunting down and eradicating the smugglers. But how could anyone hope to wipe out the brazen horde of human traffickers thriving in Libya's current mayhem? Europe will certainly be obliged to expand immediately a joint naval operation to rescue migrants at sea. But, you can be sure, others will once again protest their navies shouldn't be encouraging more refugees. Another policy, of course, would be for Europe to open its doors. Despite Europe's current problems, its countries are still immensely wealthy compared to the destitute lands from which these migrants hail. Let them in. Share a bit of your wealth. In the end, they'll only add to Europe's prosperity. Affluent nations in other parts of the globe should also help. Nice thoughts, but that's not at all the mood in much of the world these days, certainly not in Europe. For years before this latest refugee tsunami, anti-immigrant parties have been on the rise across Europe. Immigrants are accused of lowering wages, sponging off welfare systems, fomenting crime, breeding too fast, destroying national character, even plotting a religious takeover. No, we're unlikely to witness any mainstream European leader, who values his office, calling for an open door to these destitute masses. Which brings us to another very popular approach: O.K. We rescue the refugees, but then we immediately ship them all back to their homelands, or wherever -- but on their side of the moat. After all, we can't save the world. And they've brought this tragedy on themselves with their corrupt governments, their warring peoples and tribes and religious crazies. There's a certain truth to that charge. But it's too easy to forget that it was a NATO coalition -- spearheaded by the French -- the Americans ""leading from behind,"" that overthrew Muammar Gaddafi in Libya, shattering what was at least the semblance of a state into a host of warring tribes and factions, spewing arms and violence across much of Western Africa -- and throwing open the doors to the human smugglers. Similarly it was the American-led invasion of Iraq that shattered that country and helped inflame many of its neighbors. The vastly wealthy Gulf states are also implicated, currently engaged in a proxy war against Iran in Syria that has created the greatest refugee crisis since World War II. And now the Saudis -- with U.S. backing -- have opened a ferocious new front in Yemen, the most desperately poor of all Arab states.Which points up the fact that the only real, long-term solution is to deal with the problems that are provoking the flight. Rather than inflame the situation with reckless rhetoric and sophisticated arms, negotiate an end to the incredibly sanguinary conflicts that stretch across most of the Middle East.Easier said than done, but not as catastrophic as the current policies. At the same time, we have to help those countries to develop economically. The amounts needed are huge-but not compared to other things the world is spending its resources on. China is already pouring tens of billions of dollars into infrastructure and new investments from Afghanistan to Pakistan to Iraq and across Africa. Of course, the Chinese have their own agenda. But America's post World War II Marshall Plan was certainly not the product of unalloyed altruism. No, we're not suggesting a Marshall Plan. The situations are vastly different. But imagine if the trillions of dollars spent by the United States in Iraq and Afghanistan, had gone to development rather than wanton destruction. Ditto the hundreds of billions of dollars a year the world is continuing to spend on arms. Saudi Arabia, for instance spent more than 80 billion dollars on weaponry last year alone. The Emirates spent $23 billion. Even tiny Qatar just signed a $11 billion arms dollar deal with the Pentagon. Meanwhile President Obama just renewed $1.2 billion dollars in mostly military aid to Egypt. The bottom line is: No matter how much Europe would like to hunker down behind its moat, despite the wars, the poverty, disease, drought, and famine; the destitute masses on the other side of the Med are going to increase their exponential growth. Specifics? Yemen, one of the poorest of the Arab states, has more than doubled its population from 11.7 million in 1990 to 25 million today. Egypt has soared from 56 million in 1990 to 85 million. Nigeria from 95.6 million to 183 million. In fact, if current population trends continue, the population of all of Africa will grow from 1.1 billion today to 4.4 billion by the end of the century. Face it, neither moats, nor electrified two hundred foot-high fences -- they're just not going to work."

Let me explain.Imagine you're a smart, motivated, low-income student. You've probably never heard of top colleges you'd be qualified for. You don't know you can get financial aid. You can't look to your parents for guidance because in most cases you're first in your family to go to college. In your school, there is one guidance counselor for 350 students. You get average of 38 minutes a year in college counseling. You don't get taught how to write a personal statement. You can't afford SAT prep.If you do get to college, it might feel like landing on Mars. You haven't seen wealth like this before. You might show up alone with a suitcase because your parents can't take off work or can't afford the trip. Your roommate shows up with family and designer luggage. You can't afford books. You don't have a laptop. You don't know what office hours are to get extra help. You feel alone and afraid to ask for help, and things spiral. Maybe you drop out.Now imagine you want an internship. You don't know what to put on a resume. You don't know professional email etiquette. You don't know how to interview. You don't know the right professional dress. You may never have been in office building. And if you don't get the right internship, you'll have a very hard time getting your first job. Me and Hong Deng Gao at the Eighth Annual Night of OpportunityI founded The Opportunity Network to fill in these gaps. When Hong Deng, an OppNet student who is a senior at Pomona College, shared her own story at our Night of Opportunity Gala, it was more powerful than anything I could say, so I'm passing it on to you:""My dad came to the U.S. from China when I was 7. He arrived here and knew no one. He took a job washing dishes. My mother and I came here seven years later, speaking no English. Hong Deng's story is just one of thousands. Every day our country misses out on the talents, dedication and creativity of students like her because we don't give them the tools they need to go to college and launch a career. It's time to change that. I hope you'll join me in opening the doors to young people like Hong Deng everywhere."

I have gotten to the phase of my recovery where seeing babies no longer breaks my heart.",2015-04-21,"Photo by: KGC-42/STAR MAX/IPx 3/27/15 Catherine The Duchess of Cambridge visits the Stephen Lawrence Centre in Deptford. (London, England, UK)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb60339210000d501c88999.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Back when the world was expecting the Royal Heir of 2013, I was still in the midst of grieving over my own childlessness-not-by-choice. Around that time, I would approach each April bracing myself for another Mother's day without a child of my own, and I would bristle when my manicurist casually asked me if I had kids, but none of that did me in. I was OK. I was, thank goodness, past the super-sensitive phase of my grief when it felt like the whole world was one big glowing and ouchy reminder of what I didn't have and what I most wanted. During that time, I remember feeling as if every person I saw was a product of a totally normal and natural biological act that I had not been able to complete -- and basically to see a human was a reminder of my failure. Happily, this was a short-lived period of extreme sensitivity. The point is that grief changes, and eventually, grief dissipates.This time, for example, the Royal baby buzz doesn't seem to be as fevered as it was the first time round, or maybe it is just where I am. I have gotten to the phase of my recovery where seeing babies no longer breaks my heart. I can see them, enjoy them, coo over their chubby cheeks and even hold one without dissolving into a big royal train wreck. I even actually don't always mind handing them back to their mothers when they start to fuss and cry.I haven't actually kept up with this Royal pregnancy. I think I read something about how Kate had suffered terrible morning sickness again, which sounds awful. I don't envy her that, but the bigger truth is that I don't envy her, full stop. And that is what I am really writing to tell you -- what this post is really about. It's to tell you that if you are childless-not-by-choice, and you are in the midst of your grief, I want you to know that you very likely won't always feel as sad as you do now and that a day will come where you will see pregnant woman and babies without feeling like you just got socked in the ovaries. It will happen. And I am also here to tell you that it takes more then time to heal these wounds: it takes grieving, and processing, and a whole lot of work, but you can get there. If I can get here you can get here. Maybe you can't imagine that you will ever get to that place if you just found out that yet another IVF round didn't lead to conception, but someday soon when Prince Harry and Princess Name-Yet-To-Be-Determined have their first Royal bundle you will be where I am and you will remember that I told you that you too would no longer be aching as you were, and that you would move on from your grief to create a happy and meaningful life with or without kids."
