0,POLITICS,Native American Youth Tell The White House: Our Schools Are Failing Us,Rebecca Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/native-american-youth-report_us_561fbee5e4b0c5a1ce623849,"""This population is not only underserved and underrepresented, but they're darn near invisible.""",2015-10-15,"President Barack Obama greets Native American children in Cannon Ball, North Dakota, on June 13, 2014. The U.S. Department of Education released a report on Thursday about the challenges Native students face.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561fd2121400002a00c7a08a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the eighth grade, Isabella Cornell's history teacher taught students that Native Americans are ""violent, vicious vermin"" and connected their culture to cannibalism. Fellow students immediately started bullying Cornell -- who is Choctaw -- and asked if she ate other human beings. ""This is direct bullying, but nothing can be done about it because that’s what the teacher said,"" Cornell told government officials in November 2014. ""So my sister, mother, and I came into the school and presented on the actual history of Columbus. We shouldn’t have to do this. The teacher should know the correct history.""Cornell's story is not an isolated one. Last fall, federal officials heard similar accounts from more than 1,000 Native American youth and tribal leaders around the country during a listening tour organized by the White House Initiative on American Indian and Alaska Native Education and the Office for Civil Rights.The Department of Education shared some of those stories in a new report published on Thursday that outlines Native youth and tribal leaders' recommendations to the federal government, states and localities. ""Their struggles and continued efforts will not go ignored by this administration,"" WHIAIANE Executive Director William Mendoza wrote in a letter to federal, tribal, state and local leaders included in the report. ""Moving forward, we intend to honor these stories shared with us by working with you to help ensure that every Native American has the opportunity to receive a complete and competitive education in a safe and healthy school environment."" Native American students face discrimination and bullying, high rates of poverty and alarming suicide rates. On average, they post low test scores and have low high school graduation rates. The concerns of Native American youth are rarely addressed at schools and have been overlooked for far too long, Mendoza told The Huffington Post.""Ninety-five percent of American Indian and Alaska Natives attend schools where they are less than 10 percent of the population,"" said Mendoza. ""This population is not only underserved and underrepresented, but they're darn near invisible.""In Thursday's report, Native Americans urged states to collect more complete data about American Indian and Alaska Native students and to educate communities about how to file civil rights complaints. They also proposed that states and localities encourage the preservation of Native American languages, advocate for fairer discipline practices in schools, and provide cultural competency training for teachers to reduce stereotyping. States and local school districts should also abandon images that negatively portray Native American culture, such as offensive logos or school mascots, they said. The Obama administration has made a commitment to engaging Native youth and removing barriers to their their success. In 2014, President Barack Obama launched an initiative called Generation Indigenous, which increases funding for Native communities and encourages youth leadership. This past summer, the White House held its first Tribal Youth Gathering.On the federal listening tour, Native youth echoed concerns that were similar to those they expressed in a survey HuffPost conducted with the United National Indian Tribal Youth over the summer.Yet in that survey, young Native Americans also expressed hope for the future, despite the challenges they face.“We see all of the negative statistics, and the youth themselves know that when it comes to social ills, they are among the worst in terms of suicide, teen pregnancy, drug abuse, you name it,” UNITY Executive Director Mary Kim Titla told HuffPost. “They are keenly aware of that -- and despite that, the majority of them, I would say, are committed to overcoming all barriers and want to be among positive statistics.”"

She kicked off the campaign with a funny tweet:""Meet Diane (on the right). Looking for: Must be 60-70 yr old. Funny. And flexible? (Don't ask) #DateDiane,"" the tweet read. Since the campaign began, offers to hangout with Diane have been coming in from countries as far as Australia and Thailand, ABC News reported. It's also generated attention across several media outlets. Kate told HuffPost with the success of the campaign, she wants her mother to see how special she really is. ""It's my hope that she realizes through this campaign that I think she's an amazing woman who deserves to feel fabulous for at least one night!"" she said.Kate, who lives in Washington, D.C., said her father's diagnosis was tough on her mother. ""There were a few rough years right after my dad's diagnosis -- sadness, anger and frustration,"" she said. On a recent trip to visit Diane, Kate realized how lonely her mother had been and that ""something had to change."" So she took to Twitter and began posting about how great her mother is.""Why you should #DateDiane? Because she refuses to use an umbrella,"" one tweet reads. ""'They're awkward!' (She says walking through the rain).""Another tweet says, ""Why you should #DateDiane? She loves fall! #ApplePickingDate"" Though she said her mom initially probably wished she could ground her because of the tweets, it's turned into a fun experience for both of them. The pair have received a lot of support with not only offers to ""date"" Diane, but also people reaching out about their own experience with Alzheimer's. ""We've received several emails from family members in similar situations -- a lot of them sharing their personal experiences with Alzheimer's and suggestions for my mom,"" Kate said. ""It's comforting to know people out there are willing to offer their support. It's been a heartwarming experience.""The devoted daughter says she's working on setting up a few dates for her mom and Diane hopes that she can eventually find a buddy with whom she can go to hockey game, go dancing or watch a football game.

Complaints were made against him as early as 2001. Four women came forward saying Marcy groped, kissed and massaged them against their will. Chancellor Nicholas Dirks and Claude Steele, executive vice chancellor and provost, said in a statement emailed to the campus community that the school's leadership did not have the authority to take any unilateral disciplinary action against Marcy, including termination.They opted to create a written agreement that would allow them to strip Marcy of his usual due process rights, thereby avoiding the lengthy and ""uncertain"" disciplinary process of the UC system.The investigation of Marcy was brought to light after BuzzFeed published an article Friday about the findings. Berkeley said that it wouldn't personally investigate Marcy because the hearings would take too long, but that any future inappropriate behavior would not be tolerated. Many at the school felt that this wasn't enough.Students, staff and scientists within and outside the Berkeley community drafted letters to various media sources and forums voicing their concerns over the school's inaction and Marcy's lack of substantial punishment.Twenty-three current and retired staff members of Berkeley's astronomy department released an open letter on Monday asking the university to ""re-evaluate its response."" ""Sexual harassment has no place in our Department,"" the letter said. ""We believe that Geoff Marcy cannot perform the functions of a faculty member.""Tyler Kingkade contributed reporting.This piece has been updated to reflect that Geoffrey Marcy has resigned his position.______Know something we don't?

The trial will now move on to determine how much Apple owes in damages.Representatives for the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation (WARF) and Apple could not immediately be reached for comment.WARF sued Apple in January 2014 alleging infringement of its 1998 patent for improving chip efficiency.The jury was considering whether Apple's A7, A8 and A8X processors, found in the iPhone 5s, 6 and 6 Plus, as well as several versions of the iPad, violate the patent.Cupertino, California-based Apple denied any infringement and argued the patent is invalid, according to court papers. Apple previously tried to convince the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to review the patent's validity, but in April the agency rejected the bid.According to a recent ruling by U.S. District Judge William Conley, who is presiding over the case, Apple could be liable for up to $862.4 million in damages.He scheduled the trial to proceed in three phases: liability, damages, and finally, whether Apple infringed the patent willfully, which could lead to enhanced penalties.WARF used the patent to sue Intel Corp in 2008, but the case was settled the following year on the eve of trial.Last month, WARF launched a second lawsuit against Apple, this time targeting the company's newest chips, the A9 and A9X, used in the just-released iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, as well as the iPad Pro.The case is Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation v. Apple Inc in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, No. 14-cv-62. (Reporting by Andrew Chung; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Chris Reese)"
6,SPORTS,Culture Is The Winning Ingredient That's Changed The Falcons,Jordan Schultz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/atlanta-falcons-culture_us_561833e6e4b0dbb8000eb895,"In Atlanta, a GM and a head coach find common ground.",2015-10-14,"Falcons first-year head coach Dan Quinn (left) and GM Thomas Dimitroff wanted to create a healthy culture predicated on toughness, speed and guys playing freely.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561d2cc41400002a00c79c8b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Spend enough time around a professional sports franchise and you'll hear certain words come up again and again: attitude, hustle, respect, win, discipline. They permeate even the most nontraditional coaching staffs and front offices. But here's one word you might not hear as often: culture. What does it mean? And how has it changed the tenor of the Atlanta Falcons?When general manager Thomas Dimitroff found himself on the hunt for a new head coach after last season, he knew that two consecutive losing campaigns -- and a combined 10 wins -- would not cut it. He also had the benefit of an explosive offense built on a rock-solid quarterback in Matt Ryan and arguably the league's premier wide receiver, Julio Jones. Both were top-10 draft picks for Dimitroff, Ryan in 2008 and Jones in 2011.While a healthy culture is hardly an automatic guarantee of results, it's been working out pretty well for Atlanta this year. The Falcons sit perched atop the NFC South at 5-0, the second-best start in franchise history. Ryan has always ensured a solid offense, but it's been the defense -- guided by newly minted head coach Dan Quinn -- that has perhaps exceeded expectations the most in 2015, despite returning eight of 11 starters.""Dan was a coaching candidate that came to the table with a really strong, definitive plan,"" Dimitroff, 49, told The Huffington Post. ""He talked a lot about allowing the players to be the athletes they were, to allow them to play fast, free and physical ... The rest of his coaches are very mindful of the positive aspects of a player, and not stressing the negative.""Third-year cornerback Desmond Trufant -- whom Dimitroff nabbed 22nd overall in the 2013 draft and who has quickly ascended as one of football's top-flight cover guys -- has excelled in Quinn's assignment-based yet player-friendly system.""[The coaches] have simplified what we have to do,"" Trufant, pictured above, told HuffPost. ""The game plan is straightforward, and that allows us to play fast. We don't do too much on the defense, so we know how teams are going to attack us.""Last year's 6-10 disappointment mainly stemmed from a defense that ranked dead last in total yards allowed and 27th in points against. Dimitroff and Falcons owner Arthur Blank both wanted a head coach who would not only scheme at a high level, but also allow guys to maximize their athleticism by playing their game. Dimitroff wanted to forge a shared vision in that respect.""I just think that Dan has really instilled in a lot of the guys that were holdovers, and in some of the new guys, about that tenacity, about being on the edge, about flying around and not worrying about the consequences of something,"" Dimitroff said. ""It's all about competitiveness. We're a big culture team. Culture is [Quinn's] number one thing.""Quinn, 45, learned the value of culture from Pete Carroll in Seattle, where Quinn was the defensive coordinator on back-to-back Super Bowl teams, including the Seahawks' world championship win over Denver, 43-8, in 2014. Under his tutelage that season, the Seahawk defense led the league in fewest points allowed, fewest yards allowed and most takeaways. It was a masterful defense that will go down as one of the greatest in history.""Pete was the first one to challenge me from a philosophy standpoint,"" Quinn told HuffPost. ""That part made a huge difference for my own self, about how I'd like to do it if I had the chance.""Dimitroff and Quinn -- who speak upward of 10 times a day -- both believe that the relationship they've built has been crucial to sharing the same vision and translating it into success.""We interact very freely and openly on so many things,"" Dimitroff said. ""He really wants to have the best partnership ever between a head coach and a GM.""""I knew that I wanted to connect and partner up with somebody that wanted to do the program in the same fashion that I did,"" Quinn said. ""With T.D., the culture we wanted to create was one based on competition. Both of us wanted a positive environment ... We balance each other well.""Such a balance has led to dramatic improvements on the defensive side of the ball. Atlanta -- which had a game-winning pick-six against Washington in Week 5 -- currently ranks 15th in points allowed and has become the stoutest unit in the league against the run, ranking first in rushing yards allowed per game.""They tell us, don't worry about making mistakes, don't worry about anything negative,"" Trufant said. ""Just have fun and be aggressive. Play fast. And it's really showing ... If you do make a mistake, just make it 100 mph. It's just stress-free.""Look at the running backs whom the Falcons have shut down: DeMarco Murray, Arian Foster (above) and Alfred Morris. These are elite guys who've had little or no success for 60 minutes. Moreover, Quinn's defense has generated three scores (one by Trufant) in the past two weeks. That's equal to the total number during Atlanta's previous 29 games.""The whole program is based on playing fast and physical,"" Trufant said. ""Every play in practice, we going after that ball. Whether it's a strip attempt, whether it's an interception -- everybody is targeting the ball, and it's showing ... We just flying around, man, and everybody has that mindset. Every call that they give us is to get the ball back.""""[Dimitroff] and I both think that toughness is a talent,"" Quinn said. ""You have to be freed up mentally so you can make full-speed decisions. We love when we see that in guys ... We grade guys on a 'CT' [competitive and toughness] grade, and that means something to me.""Another element of Quinn's program is the technical side. For example, he aims to give his defensive personnel certain specifics -- little things that may not seem super important, but that in sum can spell the difference between winning and losing.""Receivers hate when they are pressed [at the line of scrimmage],"" Trufant said. ""That's how they get open. That's how they make their money.""""When I'm patient -- which they're teaching me -- [the receiver] doesn't get any separation,"" he went on. ""I'm being very patient, letting him dance, letting him do whatever he wants to do, and I'm just stepping into position.""A major component of Quinn's coaching philosophy involves drawing connections between football and other areas of life. He shows his players boxing videos as inspiration and has been known to use music -- rap, Bon Jovi, whatever -- to help athletes get into the right headspace.Quinn and Dimitroff remain hell-bent on pushing toward more victories. For example, they both want to improve the NFL's 30th-ranked secondary, and they both want a more threatening pass rush. But the process takes time, and the winning speaks for itself. ""This really is a 'Not for Long' League,"" Dimitroff said. Quinn echoed the sentiment: ""I don't think we're playing anywhere near as well as we will be.""For his part, Trufant believes that the emphasis on competition and culture has transformed the Falcons.""Everybody just believes,"" he said. ""Everybody has bought into the system. We believe in each other. The team has grown very close together. We all have each other's back ... We approach every week like it's a championship week, a championship game.""Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram @Schultz_Report.

Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont, said the country needs to “combat institutional racism from top to bottom” and called for “major reforms in a broken criminal justice system,” even mentioning Sandra Bland, a young black woman who died in jail earlier this year after a questionable arrest in Texas.O’Malley said Sanders made a “very, very legitimate and serious point,” and said “there would be a different reaction” if white people were being killed on a regular basis. The former Maryland governor said the country has “undervalued black lives.”Clinton, agreeing with her opponents, said the country needs “a new New Deal for communities of color.” Former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia took a different position.“Every life in this country matters,” Webb said, edging quite close to “all lives matter” rhetoric. “At the same time, I believe I can say to you I have had a long history of working with the situation with African-Americans.” While conversation about race during the CNN debate was brief, candidates touched on criminal justice reform issues throughout the evening.Sanders, who met with Black Lives Matter activists last month, said the country needs to stop dumping so much money into incarceration.“Today in America, we have more people in jail than any other country on Earth. African-American youth unemployment is 51 percent. Hispanic youth unemployment is 36 percent,” Sanders said. “It seems to me that instead of building more jails and providing more incarceration, maybe -- just maybe -- we should be putting money into education and jobs for our kids.”When moderator Anderson Cooper asked O'Malley whether the “zero tolerance” policing policies he implemented as mayor of Baltimore led to the city’s uprising earlier this year, he seemed to punt.“There’s a lot of policies that have led to this unrest,” O'Malley said. DeRay Mckesson, a prominent voice in the Black Lives Matter movement, tweeted that O’Malley “completely side-stepped” Cooper’s question about zero tolerance in Baltimore.Clinton met with leaders in the Black Lives Matter movement last week, and the activists said the former secretary of state spoke more directly about the impact of racism than she has in public. Clinton said in a recent BuzzFeed podcast that black men “are arrested more, charged more, tried more, convicted more, incarcerated more, than white men who do the very same things.” She said white people “don’t have that experience” and that it is a “very slow process” to win minds.Webb mentioned his work on criminal justice reform in his opening statement, and was then asked about his position on affirmative action, which he laid out in a 2010 Wall Street Journal op-ed titled “Diversity and the Myth of White Privilege.” Webb said he supported affirmative action only for African-Americans because of their “unique history in this country, with slavery and the Jim Crow laws that followed.”Former Rhode Island Gov. Lincoln Chafee was also at the debate.For the latest updates on tonight's debate, visit our liveblog. Related:Also on HuffPost:"

I don’t want to just make the safe, easy commercial films. I want to make the movies that move people in a way they’ve never been moved before.""Meadowland"" is certainly moving, though it achieves that without the more hysterical scenes we might expect to see given this premise. Did you set out planning to avoid that?Yes, I had it in mind from the start that I didn't want to see [the characters] cry until the end of the film. You know, when a kid goes missing, that usually means the procedural elements of fighting or crying. But I looked back to when I experienced loss. My father passed away when I was 18. It was the worst thing that ever happened to me, but it is not like that all the time. Not every moment is dark. So I thought, ""Could you give the audience a cathartic experience that could perhaps make them feel like you’ve justified for them what they’re going through?"" More interesting than a film about this terrible thing is seeing people get through it and asking the question of how they keep it together.Back in February, you wrote a piece for Indiewire about letting go of the ""female thing"" in filmmaking. Can you speak to that a bit? You know, Olivia [Wilde] is really good about reminding me of that. She says people ask her all the time, “Well, how is it working with a female director?” And she says, “Well, it’s just working with a director."" I think I feel the same way, especially going through the whole thing of being a DP and going through this boy’s club of the ASC. There are not many female DPs and people always refer to us as “female DPs."" It's the same with female directors.Why do you think saying ""female director"" or ""female DP"" versus just ""director"" or ""DP"" makes a difference?You know, there is a difference. The thing that’s difficult is young guys coming out who just directed a feature that was moderately successful, go on and get a second film and [are] offered a $100 million feature. That just doesn’t happen for women, and everybody knows it. The studios are going to more readily put their trust in a man over a woman. We just need to change that stigma, that statement attached to being a woman. How should do you think we should talk about women in the industry? How can talking about women differently create change?Well, for example, I got an award last year. It was really nice because I went to NYU and I got to come back for their Fusion Film festival, which is a woman’s film festival, and they presented me with this Woman of the Year Award. I hadn’t really prepared a speech but I did manage to babble something out and at the end I kind of said, “This is such an honor to be recognized, but the one thing I hope for us as a group is that an award like this doesn’t exist one day.” Oh, definitely. Although, before that ideal future, what kind of changes do you hope for on a more short-term basis? I think, if there are lists, there just needs to be women on them. I know sometimes it’s harder to find the hot female director or the hot female DP, but I think people need to be a little more conscious of that. You need to make it known to all the women coming that you can do this job and it’s not weird. The exposure and the idea of seeing women behind the camera, of seeing them controlling the set in a way that’s the same as any dude, we need more of that, and we need people to make a conscious choice to hire women. I don't like to complain about it, to say, ""We're special because we're female,"" but I think things will start to improve and eventually not needing that [special status] will become the norm. It may take a long time.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.Also on HuffPost:For a constant stream of entertainment news and discussion, follow HuffPost Entertainment on Viber."

Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/domestic-hate-groups-online-doj_us_561d7491e4b0c5a1ce60f874,"""More people have died in this country in attacks by domestic extremists than in attacks associated with international terrorist groups.""",2015-10-14,Assistant Attorney General for National Security John Carlin on Wednesday spoke about the threat of domestic extremists recruiting on social media.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/561d7bd21400006f003c8282.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Just like the Islamic State, radical domestic hate groups can use social media to spread messages and inspire attacks in the United States, a top counterterrorism official said Wednesday.Domestic terrorism is a ""real threat"" that ""demands to be addressed in new and creative ways,"" John Carlin, Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Justice Department's National Security Division, said at an event at George Washington University on Wednesday. With the nation's focus on Islamic extremists since the Sept. 11 attacks, domestic extremism ""doesn't get discussed as much as it should,"" Carlin said. However, ""over the past few years, more people have died in this country in attacks by domestic extremists than in attacks associated with international terrorist groups,"" Carlin said.For domestic terrorists -- just as it has for ISIS -- social media ""can create for an extreme segment of society a sort of 'radicalization echo chamber' where followers reinforce for each other extremist propaganda and calls for violence,"" Carlin said. ""White supremacists post to social media, and studies now posit that mass killings are contagious. Violence begets violence, and through the power of the internet, a meeting hall is no longer needed. Formal organizational structures are unnecessary. Connections are made, and messages spread, through the push of a button,"" Carlin said in prepared remarks. As the the white percentage of the U.S. population is expected to shrink over the next several decades, which could cause extremists to feel marginalized, the government is ""definitely concerned about the challenge going forward,"" Carlin said.But Carlin indicated that he didn't believe the U.S. government should designate domestic organizations as terrorist organizations, as it does with foreign groups, even though doing so would make it possible to bring ""material support"" charges against individuals who, for example, back certain organizations on social media. ""Domestic terrorism groups,"" he noted, are not impacted by the “material support” statute -- a state affairs that ""reflects our values.""""To do that for a group here would mean, based on who the group is and what they're doing, the entire group is designated as a terrorist group,"" Carlin said.​​He said that undercover sting operations were also important in the domestic realm, but added that it was important to make sure defendants accused of ​planning an attack ""take that extra step to walk the walk"" by demonstrating willingness to act.Carlin also announced a new position within the Justice Department that will serve as the ""main point of contact"" for federal prosecutors around the county who work on domestic terrorism matters. He also touted the Domestic Terrorism Executive Committee, which the Justice Department reestablished in 2014, and said that the group now includes representatives of both the Civil Rights Division and the Tax Division. Heidi Beirich of the Southern Poverty Law Center said her organization appreciated the efforts, as many had felt that the domestic terrorism threat wasn't getting as much attention as it should from the federal government. Carlin's comments seemed to echo those former Attorney General Eric Holder made in an interview with The Huffington Post earlier this year.""I think as a nation, we as a people have not focused on the domestic threat. We have thought that the threat is from without, and that the threat to the extent that it exists within the nation is only based on ideologies that come from outside of the United States,"" Holder said.While Holder called the Charleston shooting earlier this year ""clearly an act of terrorism"" that should serve as a ""wake-up call"" for the country, and while the Justice Department treated the shooting in Charleston as a potential act of domestic terrorism, Dylann Roof was eventually indicted on federal hate crime charges.""This type of crime in particular -- racially motivated violence -- for which a federal law was specifically enacted to cover is of grave importance to the federal government,"" Attorney General Loretta Lynch said in July when she announced the charges against Roof."
