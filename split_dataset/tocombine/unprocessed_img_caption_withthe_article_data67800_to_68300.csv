Fletcher died Sunday at age 56.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"FERGUSON, Mo. -- Brian Fletcher, a former mayor of Ferguson, Missouri, who launched a successful campaign to help businesses affected by community unrest in 2014, has died, the city said in a statement. Fletcher, 56, died late Sunday.Fletcher served as mayor of the largely African-American city from 2005 to 2011, and during that time oversaw the revitalization of a portion of the downtown area. Fletcher, a whose political career lasted 28 years, had retired from AT&T. While employed there, he served as vice president of a local chapter of Communications Workers of America.Three years later after Fletcher's tenure as mayor, the city was rocked by protests following the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager who was shot by a white Ferguson police officer. During demonstrations over the treatment of blacks in the region, rioters destroyed many businesses.Fletcher tried to serve downtown businesses by launching the “I Love Ferguson” campaign. The campaign sold T-shirts, hats and other items with the phrase “I Love Ferguson” printed on them to raise $130,000, which was donated to businesses affected by the unrest.Last year, Fletcher was elected as Ferguson’s Ward 2 councilman. “As recently as last week he helped provide more than 200 new coats for area students, including many that would not have had one otherwise,” said city spokesman Jeff Small. Ferguson Mayor James Knowles said in a statement that Fletcher was the “true champion of the city of Ferguson.”“Brian worked tirelessly and selflessly to bring people together in the spirit of a shared love for our community,” said Knowles.Fletcher leaves behind a wife and two daughters, the city said in its statement.Also On HuffPost:"
1,POLITICS,Senate Stalls Confirmation Of First Openly Gay Army Secretary,Amanda Terkel and Jennifer Bendery,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eric-fanning-army_us_569425c9e4b05b3245da1879,Eric Fanning will take another job at the Pentagon while he waits.,2016-01-11,"If confirmed, Eric Fanning would become the first openly gay Army secretary.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55fc70f12000002600242916.jpeg?cache=aUxgWEagKp&ops=crop_0_120_2400_1517%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Eric Fanning is stepping aside as acting secretary of the Army as the Senate continues to drag out his confirmation vote. If approved, he would be the first openly gay Army secretary.President Barack Obama first nominated Fanning in September. He has served in senior positions in the Defense Department, including acting undersecretary of the Army, special assistant to Defense Secretary Ashton Carter and undersecretary of the Air Force.In early November, Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) placed a hold on Fanning's nomination over an unrelated issue: opposition to Obama's push to close the U.S. prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The Pentagon announced Monday that Fanning will temporarily take a staff position in the secretary's office until the Senate confirms him. Some senators were concerned that Fanning would be violating federal law if he continued to serve as acting Army secretary while his confirmation was pending. ""You don't put people in jobs until they are confirmed by the Senate. That’s pretty straightforward,"" Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said Monday, according to DefenseNews.In addition to filling the role of acting secretary, Fanning had been serving since June as acting undersecretary, the Army's second-highest post. But last week, the Senate confirmed former Rep. Patrick Murphy (D-Pa.) as undersecretary. Murphy will now temporarily fill both roles.A White House spokesman did not respond to a request for comment on what specifically spurred Fanning to relinquish his title of acting secretary. The Pentagon said Fanning was stepping aside as ""a show of comity"" to the Senate. ""We expect this move to be of a short duration and for Fanning to achieve speedy confirmation,"" Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook told the AP. ""He remains one of the most qualified nominees to be a service secretary, having served in many senior executive positions in each of the three military departments and as chief of staff of the department.""McCain chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, which needs to approve Fanning before he can head to the floor for a full vote. So far, no date has been set for a hearing in the committee. The lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights community applauded Fanning's nomination in September as the latest step by the administration to open up the military. “Considering the tremendous struggles that LGBT Americans have faced within the Department of Defense, Fanning’s nomination is deeply significant,"" Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, said at the time. ""This is a sign of hope and a demonstration of continued progress towards fairness and equality in our nation’s armed forces.""This piece has been updated with comments from McCain."

California Teachers Association seem prepared to turn the page and view them through a stricter lens.""The problem that's before us is whether or not individuals can be compelled to support political views that they disagree with,"" said Chief Justice John Roberts, seemingly endorsing the argument that even fees that go to a union's collective bargaining efforts -- which cover every worker, even those who aren't union members -- can impinge on the right to free speech. Michael Carvin, the lawyer representing the group of California public school teachers challenging the fees, argued repeatedly that such financial contributions ""coerce the employee to subsidize"" politics he or she doesn't support and goes beyond the core function of supporting collective bargaining for better salaries and other benefits.Drawing a contrast with private-sector unionism, Justice Antonin Scalia said sitting at the bargaining table with the government ""is, in all cases, a matter of public concern."" And he hinted that ""that may require a change of the rule"" advanced nearly 40 years ago in Abood v. Detroit Board of Education.That case said the collection of fees under ""agency shop"" arrangements, even from nonmembers, was ""constitutionally justified"" because it recognized ""the important contribution of the union shop to the system of labor relations."" But beginning with a pair of cases in 2012 and 2014, conservative justices on the Supreme Court began to chip away at that language in Abood, calling it ""questionable"" and ""something of an anomaly"" in constitutional law.""Overruling Abood now would substantially disrupt established First Amendment doctrine and labor management systems in nearly half the country,"" warned David Frederick, the lawyer for the California teachers unions defending the agency fee arrangements.Indeed, the liberal justices tried to reconcile the free-speech issues in the case by coming back to the concept of ""stare decisis"" -- the principle that the Supreme Court is bound by its prior decisions. And if overturning Abood is the goal, Justice Elena Kagan said Carvin and the nonunion teachers carry ""a heavy burden.""""This is a case in which there are tens of thousands of contracts with these provisions,"" she said. ""Those contracts affect millions of employees, maybe as high as 10 million employees. So what special justification are you offering here?""Carvin said requiring nonunion workers to pay agency fees ""erroneously denies a fundamental right"" -- a line of thinking that not only garnered support from conservatives on the court, but also from Justice Anthony Kennedy, often the pivotal vote in closely divided cases.Kennedy dismissed the concern that disallowing the fees would create a regime of ""free riders"" who reap the benefits of unionism without contributing their fair share.""The union basically is making these teachers compelled riders for issues on which they strongly disagree,"" he said, later adding that if collective bargaining truly does improve their standing in the workplace, ""the union can convince teachers to join the union.""Roberts likewise brushed aside unions' free ridership worries, noting that the problem is ""insignificant"" where ""employees have shown overwhelmingly that they want collective bargaining."""

In it, Bowie's style is impeccable. His hair is combed back or hanging to the side, just so. His jawline, apparently chiseled by the Gods. His eyes, peering into your soul. The photos were taken in March 1976 in Rochester, New York. After playing a show in the area, he was arrested at a hotel along with Iggy Pop and two others for having a bunch of weed on them. Though they were charged with possession of marijuana, they never went to jail, and Bowie again played in the western New York state city.

16,BLACK VOICES,Central Park Five: Rehire Teacher Allegedly Fired Over Central Park Five Lesson,Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/central-park-five-lesson-teacher-fired_us_568fe2b3e4b0c8beacf6b5c8,"Administrators reportedly were concerned the lessons would cause ""riots"" among black students.",2016-01-11,"Raymond Santana, right, Kevin Richardson, and Yusef Salaam, left, all members of the Central Park Five, react to supporters Thursday, Jan. 17, 2013, in New York.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Two of the five men who were wrongfully convicted in the 1989 rape and assault of a woman in Central Park have expressed support for a New York City teacher who says she lost her job after teaching students about the case. ""We support her 100 percent,"" Raymond Santana, a member of a group known as the Central Park Five, told The Huffington Post. ""We'll probably rally for her -- go to the courthouse. I want her to keep doing what she's doing. I hope this doesn't discourage her."" He believes the teacher should be reinstated, he added. Jeena Lee-Walker, who taught English at the High School of the Arts, Imagination and Inquiry in Manhattan's Upper West Side, filed a federal lawsuit last week alleging that administrators at the school feared her lessons on the Central Park Five might ""rile up"" black students and cause small ""riots."" They asked her to take a more ""balanced"" approach in teaching students about the case, her lawsuit claims. “I was stunned,” Lee-Walker told the Daily News Friday. “I was kind of like, the facts are the facts. This is what happened.”Students, she told the paper, ""and black students in particular, should be riled up.”“It was awesome -- they were so engaged,” she said of teaching her students about the Central Park Five, adding that they were ""really moved"" by a 2012 documentary on the subject. ""They really identified with the teenagers.”Lee-Walker says she received a series of bad performance reviews, and was ultimately fired, in retaliation for pushing back against criticism from administrators over her Central Park Five lessons. Santana, Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, Kevin Richardson and Korey Wise -- all black and Latino men -- were all under 16 years old when they were each arrested in 1989 for the beating and rape of Trisha Melli, a 28-year-old investment banker. The brutal attack dominated headlines, with the city's tabloids stirring racially charged fears of ""wilding"" groups of violent black and Latino teenagers across the city.Police zeroed in on the five teens, all of whom had reportedly been in or near Central Park at the time of the attack.Each teen confessed to the crime during 24 hours of interrogation, but later claimed their statements had been coerced by police. They were all nevertheless convicted and sentenced to prison in 1990. (At the time, billionaire businessman and current Republican front-runner Donald Trump called for their execution.)Santana, McCray, Salaam and Richardson each spent nearly six years in prison. Wise spent nearly 13 years in prison. The convictions against the men were vacated in 2002 after a New York inmate named Matias Reyes confessed to raping Melli. Then-Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau announced that DNA evidence from the crime scene matched Reyes' DNA. In 2014, the city agreed to pay the five men a total of $40 million to settle a federal lawsuit they had filed. Santana said on Friday that he was deeply disappointed in the administrators' alleged concerns that black students might react violently to Lee-Walker's lessons. ""It's viewing them as if they're gonna become animals, they're gonna riot, and tear up the school,"" he said. ""A person who thinks that way shouldn't be in education."" The New York City Department of Education deferred comment to the New York City Law Deptartment, which defends city agencies in court. ""We will review the claims,” a law department spokesman told HuffPost.Salaam had a message for Lee-Walker.""We salute you,"" he said. ""We are so thankful that there are teachers like you that are wiling to talk about the truth in spite of the fact that you've been asked to water down things. We don't anything to be watered down.""""She just did a revolutionary act,"" Salaam added. He and Santana now travel the country talking to students in elementary, middle and high schools about their story, and say they never have had problems with students acting out or misbehaving because of their lessons.Teaching students about the Central Park Five, Salaam said, helps young people understand ""what their rights are, how they should be interacting with police officers, how to stay alive, and how to stay out of the grips of the criminal justice system."" ""We don't preach anything anti-police, anti-DA's office,"" Santana added. ""It's the exact opposite -- it's 'we need you guys in these fields in order to make changes.' It's about trying to make them independent thinkers, to go into these fields and do their jobs."""

""Thank you for choosing me, thank you for your brilliance, thank you for teaching me so much,"" she said. ""You make movies like you don't even care if anyone sees them."" The actress then went on to express her love in a way only she could. As she started walking off stage, she admitted, ""I want us to be buried next to each other, I really do."" We'll probably never fully understand the depth of their relationship, but seeing as JLaw has won a Golden Globe for every one of her roles in a David O.

Lawrence beat Lily Tomlin, Melissa McCarthy and Maggie Smith for the award, as well as her BFF and new collaborator Amy Schumer, who was nominated for her role in ""Trainwreck.""

Bernie Sanders (I) remains on the heels of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. She leads the senator by just 3 points, 48 percent to 45 percent -- within the poll's margin of error -- while former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley stands at 5 percent.Clinton maintains a more comfortable lead in the HuffPost polling average of Iowa, however.On the Republican side, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and real estate mogul Donald Trump appear to be battling it out for the Hawkeye State. Cruz leads Trump by 4 points among likely caucusgoers, 28 percent to 24 percent. They are followed by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio with 13 percent and famed neurosurgeon Ben Carson with 11 percent. No other candidate in the crowded race makes it out of the single digits.The HuffPost polling average also shows Cruz topping Trump, partly due to Carson's dramatic fall.In New Hampshire, the race for the Democratic nomination is similarly close. Sanders tops Clinton by 4 points among likely primary voters, 50 percent to 46 percent, although that gap is again within the poll's margin of error. The Republican contest in the Granite State appears much more settled. At 30 percent, Trump continues to lead the field by an overwhelming margin -- 16 points -- and maintain a firm lead that he has held for months. The more interesting story is the free-for-all in the establishment lane. Trump is followed by Rubio with 14 percent, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie at 12 percent, Cruz at 10 percent, and Ohio Gov. John Kasich and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush tied at 9 percent each among likely primary voters.Also on HuffPost:"

He later participated in a live town hall where he engaged critics of his policies.Clinton has also gone after Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), her rival in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, over his stance on guns.

Cruz was born in Calgary, Alberta, but his mother was a U.S. citizen, which he says makes him eligible to run.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told ABC's ""This Week"" that the Senate would not act to formally counter Trump's claim that the senator's Canadian birth makes him ineligible to be president. Cruz's father was born in Cuba.In 2008, the Senate passed a resolution declaring Senator John McCain, a Republican presidential candidate, a natural born citizen.

The billionaire businessman highlighted the citizenship issue last week, warning that Democrats could challenge Cruz's eligibility in court.Asked on ""Fox News Sunday"" whether he really doubted Cruz was a natural born citizen, Trump said, ""I don't know. I really don't know. It depends.""Does natural born mean born to the land, meaning born on the land? In that case, he's not.""Trump said the term has not been adjudicated, and advised Cruz to seek a judgment.""The Democrats are going to bring a lawsuit,"" Trump predicted.
