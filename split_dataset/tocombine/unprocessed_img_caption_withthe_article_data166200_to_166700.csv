In 2012, Armstrong decided to give up the battle against doping charges, saying ""enough is enough"" but acknowledging no wrongdoing. The move began his swift fall from being perhaps the nation's best-known cancer-fighting hero, and though he maintains he was victimized by a ""witch hunt"" he was still stripped of all seven of his Tour de France victories.

It seems very clear he did some doping in his career, how much we don't know.But there are a number of obstacles to a full confession.The New York Times has reported Armstrong's supporters are concerned he could face perjury charges if he confesses to using performance-enhancing drugs, because he made sworn testimony in a 2005 court case that he had never done so.We all make mistakes, we all do things wrong. Our ""impostors"" need to be patted on the back, need approval and need love. ""Impostors"" are all about being seen and heard and they don't care if it's in a positive or negative way as long as people are talking about them. They are fame-mongers!""Two things scare me. The first is getting hurt. But that's not nearly as scary as the second, which is losing."" -- Lance ArmstrongHowever, your ""authentic soul"" (ego) also wants to be seen and heard but more importantly, wants to be respected and to behave with integrity. When you tame your ""impostors"" (your unconscious mind) you can still get the love, appreciation and respect you want from working hard, but you won't feel the need to cut corners and/or deceive others, especially those that are working for you.The Lance Armstrong story is an interesting case study about a very talented, capable person with a big heart who cares about the world and created a wonderful organization, the Livestrong Foundation, that has helped millions. I, for one, have several friends with cancer and my mother passed away two years ago from cancer, so I'm appreciative of all the support his foundation has given to us. Unfortunately, when you do it with deceit, it takes away some of the respect, but let us not forget all the good he has done also.As a life coach, I have found that Mr. Armstrong's situation is common. Most of my high-end clients feel guilty for their success because of cheating or selling out at some point to reach the top, and many of my not-so-successful clients also have traded their dignity for an opportunity but failed anyway. So I want to suggest that we take some time to think about the pressure that society (parents, teachers, community) puts on us and what we can do to change as a whole. Lance was caught so he's been put in the spotlight, but if we turn our focus on what can we learn from this instead of ""hating"" on Lance, I think we will all grow and learn from it and hopefully, it won't be as prominent. Look at your own life and remember times when you've cheated, lied or done something wrong on whatever level. How did it make you feel, regardless of how small the incident?Lets all look into our hearts and try to understand this epidemic of the need win at all costs. What are we as parents and society instilling in our kids' minds? That's what we should be talking about.For more by Lisa Haisha, click here.For more on emotional intelligence, click here."

FWISD officials closed all schools in Fort Worth late on April 29 in an effort to stop the spread of the virus. (Photo by Tom Pennington/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb9de26000033007f97c4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Schools in Grayville, Ill., closed on Monday, and won't reopen until Thursday, after more than 20 percent of the town's elementary through high school kids came down with the flu. From Minnesota to Oklahoma, schools have made similar decisions, while workplaces, hospitals, churches and sports teams are taking their own precautions in the face of what is likely the worst flu season in more than a decade.""Kids are generous in sharing secretions,"" said Dr. Marty Cetron of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who has three kids of his own.When the flu strikes, kids tend to be the first sick due to their lower immunity and more frequent contact with others -- including the natural intermingling at crowded schools. ""Once the virus gets into schools, it spreads fast,"" Cetron added. ""Then kids come home, creating a cascading effect in the community.""In a study published in October, Cetron and fellow researchers evaluated the approaches taken by two Texas school districts' during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. One district temporarily closed schools early in the outbreak, while the other kept doors open throughout.Cetron said the differences were ""profound,"" including fewer self-reported emergency visits and influenza-like illness in areas where schools had closed, even if only for a week or so. The benefits also extended beyond the students to entire communities.Based on his own research, Bruce Lee, an expert in infectious diseases at the University of Pittsburgh, said he's less optimistic about the flu-fighting strategy. Closures may not only fail to protect kids from the flu or thwart an outbreak, he said. They may actually ""refuel the epidemic"" once those kids return to school.""We found school closures prohibitively expensive and not very effective,"" said Lee, whose research used computer simulations based on census data.Lee's research suggests that once a virus has spread throughout a community, schools would have to remain closed for a long time -- say eight or nine weeks -- to offer any lasting protection from the flu. That means significant losses in teacher productivity and parents' work time.Modeling studies like Lee's are important, said Cetron, but ""don't replace real life,"" such as the experiences of students in Dallas and Fort Worth, Texas, during the 2009 pandemic.""Even a short term dismissal could allow people to become educated, get vaccinated and develop some immunity,"" said Cetron.Still, Cetron acknowledged that many other factors, such as the timing, strain and spread of the virus, play a role. Simply reacting to a flu outbreak, as Grayville and other districts have done this year, is less effective than closing schools before a large number of students fall ill. Closing schools is also not a ""trivial intervention,"" and its disruptiveness may be even less appealing to school officials before an outbreak's impact has played out, said Cetron.Researchers including Cetron are now collecting experiences of places like Grayville, Ill., to evaluate the success of various strategies, while also noting that there is no one-size-fits-all approach. ""If you've got a school that serves special needs kids, or a faculty with high proportion of people undergoing cancer therapy, you might need different approaches,"" Cetron said.Both Cetron and Lee agreed that a whole suite of interventions should be employed within a community.""Not practicing 'presentee-ism' at work when you're sick, and being cognizant of where you sneeze and what you do with your hands, makes a big difference,"" said Cetron. ""First and foremost, protect yourself -- get immunized. And if you get sick, be a good citizen in your community and don't share the virus with others.""In many communities, other social institutions are also taking their own steps to guard against the flu. Some hospitals, for example, are limiting visitors. Portsmouth Regional Hospital in New Hampshire is going as far as to keep kids out -- unless they're seeking treatment, of course. Churches, too, are taking the cue, with many urging parishioners to stay home if they have the flu and avoid shaking hands during rite of peace. Some Catholic churches have also stopped offering a shared chalice during Holy Communion. Also among the gathering places in which germs can fly: sporting events and grocery stores.The Manhattan Soccer club is reportedly encouraging its players not to shake or touch hands with opposing players during games. Rather, during the traditional post-game lineup for high-fives, the club suggests that ""the safest thing to do is touch elbows."" Cetron said he is all for creating new ways to minimize the sharing of secretions. ""If you decide to do elbow bumps instead of handshakes, that makes good sense as long as you are not sneezing into someone's face,"" Cetron said.Pam Rankin keeps similar considerations in mind while she works at the IGA Supermarket in Grayville, reports a local news station, WTVW. One of Rankin's kids, who attends a now-closed school, iscurrently sick at home with the flu.""I don't want to spread it to the customers and have all them come down sick either,"" Rankin told WTVW. ""We've been using hand sanitizers, sanitizing wipes, spraying over everything."""

Kusama's signature splash of dots has now arrived in the realm of fashion in a new collection from French luxury brand Louis Vuitton - bags, sunglasses, shoes and coats. The latest Kusama collection is showcased at its boutiques around the world, including New York, Paris, Tokyo and Singapore, sometimes with replica dolls of Kusama. (AP Photos/Wong Maye-E)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb15d3c0000320009dc59.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Alexander Wang tank tops, J Brand jeans and a Rag & Bone sweater similar to the very one I was wearing. Although each item on this color-coordinated rack could have been in any of the brand-focused, on-trend boutiques near my New York apartment, this was Paris. I expected something... more.This particular disappointment came at Le66, a shopping super-store on the Champs Elysées. I had read online during my Eurostar journey from London that the boutique's holdings ""[posed] a serious threat to the seemingly impenetrable Colette."" This endorsement alone warranted a visit, as my first trip to Sarah Lerfel's famed Parisian boutique years ago remains a memorable experience. The important difference, however, between the two Paris-based stores was that while Colette features exhibits from artists, like Max Snow, and exclusive previews of collections, like Love editor Katie Grand's recent collaboration with Hogan, Le66 has brands that one could purchase in many high-end stores and online around the world. All I could think was, what's the point of purchasing a Phillip Lim skirt abroad that I can buy at home, for less? To say I bought it in Paris? And, wait, even Colette's goods are available online.This was not the first time I have felt cheated of the Edith Wharton-esque fantasy I have had of New Yorker's trip to Paris for exclusive and unseen goods. But, globalization has taken away some of the novelty of travel and much has changed for the fashion industry since the early 20th century. Still, when I imagine shopping in Paris, I think of the city's many historic couturiers, like Givenchy, Louis Vuitton, Yves Saint Laurent and the overwhelming splendor of a Chanel runway show at the Grand Palais. The reality, for me and others with a budget, is that these stores are reserved for window shopping only (especially after purchasing an international plane ticket). While the number on a price tag on a Lanvin gown might be slightly lower in France, the reduction is insignificant to most.My love for the European high street began as soon as I could dress myself (which, to my parent's horror, was before I could talk). Growing up, my British grandmother would bring me presents from Topshop, Mango and Zara -- as well as finds from her local charity shops (the fashion-loving apple didn't fall far from the chic granny tree). Not only were these large-scale European-based brands more fashion-forward than what I could find at my local New Jersey mall, they were also exciting because I knew no one I knew would be wearing them. These clothes became something that made me feel like I stood out. I would excitedly await our annual Christmas-time trip to visit my family... and fill out my wardrobe. Now, not much time has passed, but on my most recent trip to Paris the feeling of shopping déjà vu that I experienced at Le66 continued as many of Paris' high-street stores -- Comptoir des Cotonniers, Sandro, Maje -- are now available in the U.S. (Zadig et Voltaire's designs are even available at Target.) With H&M, Topshop, Zara and more within walking distance of my apartment -- and available through e-commerce for the rest of the country -- Europe's mass retailers are just around the corner.There are still a few chains that I like to frequent when abroad. Although outwardly I bemoan the fact that the H&M-owned chain COS has yet to cross the Atlantic, I relish in the ability to purchase stiff blouses, leather-paneled dresses and pleated skirts that my friends are less likely to own as well. While a visit to the high street -- and COS -- isn't the only reason I love visiting Paris (a buttery croissant I ate upon arrival outshone any kind of possible shopping-gasm), it is certainly an enjoyable perk. And there's almost nothing quite like the magical experience of walking down a twinkling retail-filled Parisian street, like Rue Vieille du Temple or Rue Saint-Honoré. It was on one of these strolls that I discovered a reason -- beyond people watching -- to visit the original outposts of French brands now additionally located in New York: price.""Maje?"" A salesgirl at the Maje boutique said, pointing to the blue coat I had purchased when the store opened its first North American boutique in Manhattan's West Village in December 2011. ""Yes!"" I excitedly exclaimed, feeling utterly au courant at the recognition in spite of my muddy boots and the shabby knit hat keeping me warm on a long walk from the Louvre to Sacré Coeur. But, this sensation was fleeting.""Maje,"" the girl said again, pointing to the back of the store, where my exact coat was marked to less than one-eighth of the price I had paid just over a year ago.""We are a stock store,"" another employee explained. ""We have the new summer collection, but also winter and last year.""""New York is double the price,"" he continued, almost taunting me with the wonderful news.Well, then. And so it was that I discovered the stock stores of Paris. A.P.C., Chloe, Les Petites and Maje's sister store Sandro all had locations dedicated to selling last season's goods -- in addition to being already much lower than their American counterparts. (Think of them as a year-round sample sale, if that doesn't make you too excited, or an outlet mall in the center of a city.)While it might not be swirling in a custom-made Pierre Cardin gown, it was enough for me to just be in Paris, surrounded by beautiful things and feel like I had discovered something new."
3,DIVORCE,Forgiveness Is Overrated: Accepting The Narcissist,"Tina Swithin, Contributor

We have been taught by virtually every religion under the sun that there is great power in forgiveness. Most studies on forgiveness tout the health benefits of forgiveness from both a mental and physical standpoint.  The art of forgiveness is simply letting go of hostility or resentment for a perceived transgression. The act of forgiveness is usually preceded by an admission of wrongdoing or an acknowledgement of the offense and many times, a request for forgiveness. I have never struggled with forgiveness until I divorced a narcissist. A narcissist will never admit an indiscretion, nor are they capable of accepting responsibility, which leaves the offended party in an interesting predicament.  I believe that the key to forgiveness is that the said offense is in the past. Anyone who has attempted to co-parent with a narcissist or other high-conflict personality knows that the past often repeats weekly and in many cases, involves the children. I personally struggle with forgiveness as it directly relates to my ex-husband showing little or no regard for the well-being or safety of our children. When someone harms my child -- whether it is emotionally or physically, the fierce momma bear comes forth and I am ready to protect. Forgiveness is not on my radar when the issues are constant, in the present tense and involve harm to my children.  I have personally experienced the power of forgiveness but not in the way that you may expect. Over the past two years, I spent a great deal of time sitting in therapy, penning my thoughts onto paper and digging deep to understand why I fell prey to a narcissist in the first place. I owned my role in the equation and I acknowledged the yellow, orange and red flags that I chose to ignore during our courtship. I then extended an olive branch and forgave myself. The healing that I experienced from forgiving myself was life changing.  I recently spoke to Dr. Robert Enright, professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and founder of the International Forgiveness Institute, Inc. who eloquently weighed in on the topic of acceptance and forgiveness.  ""To accept a person and to accept a situation are two different things. We can accept people who are unjust because they are mistaken, confused, and nonetheless possess inherent worth because they are persons. We should be careful in accepting unjust situations themselves, lest we grow complacent with the injustice. Accepting persons despite their flaws may be a marker on the path to forgiveness, which is difficult to accomplish in the short-run especially when the injustices are on-going.""  For the past three years, I have personally struggled with the topic of forgiveness. I have recently concluded that forgiveness is overrated as it pertains to the narcissist. My New Year's resolution involves acceptance, rather than forgiveness. I am attempting to shift my perception of the situation by showing empathy for the personality disorder in general. What is life without love and honest relationships with those around you? I accept that my ex-husband didn't choose to be narcissist. Acceptance of my ex-husband and my high-conflict divorce does not mean that I forgive his behavior and actions that continue to cause damage to our young children."
4,DIVORCE,Casanova,"Whiskey Tortoise, Contributor
Writer, editor, essayist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/casanova_us_5b9cafcfe4b03a1dcc80e08e,"Mistresses are privy to all sorts of misplaced condescension, and condemnation, from family, friends and co-workers.",2013-01-15,Cropped closeup of a woman wearing red lipstick and biting her lip,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cafcf2000003100fdac4a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Affairs are controversial. Personal opinions vary according to personal experience, but for some reason it seems perfectly acceptable to cast arbitrary judgment, and indignation, onto the other woman. Mistresses are privy to all sorts of misplaced condescension, and condemnation, from family, friends and co-workers. In order to protect herself, a mistress needs a shield, and this shield is a confidante: a close friend who will listen, nod in agreement and ask constructive questions.A confidante is that rare friend who is willing to engage with messy details and complicated situations. If you don't already know whom your dearest friend is -- the one you look forward to regaling with your most inappropriate, incriminating, and downright humiliating escapades -- then finding one is easy. If you can't immediately pinpoint whom that special someone is, don't despair. Simply test the waters to find out which friend or acquaintance keeps an open-mind. The exact friend you're looking for may be just around the corner. Whether this friend is readily available, or they're waiting to be found, there is an easy way to figure out whether a person possesses the requirements of a bona fide confidante. Simply bring up controversial topics like sex, open relationships, and affairs -- in that order. If you get to the latter and find you're still being met with enthusiasm, then you've probably found your special someone. The ideal confidante is someone who not only lends an ear, but also relishes your tales of illicit passion. You see, a confidante values friendship over moralism; she understands that an open mind lends itself better to nurturing than it does to condemnation. I'm not necessarily saying that having an affair enriches human experience, but I am saying that a true friend is willing to engage with curious, risky behavior, and be by your side as you wade through difficult choices. This willingness makes them better friends, probably better lovers, maybe even better humans. I count myself lucky because for years now, I've had a friend like this. Ever since we met in college, we've been one another's confidantes. Some people naturally compel you to confess your darkest secrets, as if they possess an ability to find the redeeming truth in whatever mess you create, and then make you laugh about it. Once you confess your secret thoughts and your questionable behavior, a confidante will ask you to go on. And as you tell her more, she will continue to listen. That's the kind of friend Casanova is to me. Casanova and I talk about everything. I want to tell you a bit about her, but there's too much to say, so instead I want to use Casanova as a model for the kind of person you need by your side when journeying through the mysterious waters of infidelity. The best way to do this might be to recount a conversation Casanova and I had when I confessed to becoming a mistress to a heterosexual woman who was in a long-term relationship with, you guessed it -- a man. Casanova gasped when I told her, but not with shock: she gasped with delight. Then she asked me a series of important questions.Casanova: Can you see yourself in a relationship with her? Whiskey: Never.Casanova: Does she still have sex with her boyfriend?Whiskey: I don't know. Is that something I'm supposed to ask her?Casanova: Never.Whiskey: I only ask about her relationship when I want to know if her boyfriend suspects anything.Casanova: You're a perfect mistress.Whiskey: I think what I like best is the lack of expectation.Casanova: Do you feel you're being seen as a better version of yourself, because you're the antidote to an actual, flawed partner?Whiskey: I do.Casanova: At this stage, you really can't do anything wrong.Whiskey: What if she started to want something more?Casanova: I guess you would have a situation on your hands, but it wouldn't hurt your ego.Relationships change over time, and in the grand scheme, affairs are especially temporary. Friends, on the other hand, are likely to support you whether you're on a one-way track to success or making mistake after mistake. The love of a true friend -- real, unconditional love -- doesn't diminish just because you're going through a difficult ordeal, or making perplexing decisions. A friend won't condemn you for carrying on an affair, or reduce you to being a mistress, because they know that being a mistress is but one of many strange turns your life will take. See, friends like Casanova are happy to talk to you about the complicated stuff. They're comfortable listening to things they don't perfectly understand. And they're not afraid to admit being completely titillated by what they're hearing."

(AP Photo/Universal Pictures)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb6aa2100005100c53c1e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"No matter how many times I see the play or watch the movie, the story of redemption in Victor Hugo's Les Miserables never fails to both move me to tears and challenge me on a deeply spiritual level. This weekend, I finally had a chance to see the much-anticipated, recent film adaption of Les Mis, and while I've had the pleasure of seeing the play in different countries and languages, I never seem to get over the transcendent, almost supernatural, kindness of Bishop Myriel. Each time I'm reminded of the bishop's act of mercy, I can't help but ask myself if I have the moral fiber to respond with the same sort of otherworldly love, the kind that surpasses basic human nature.This supernatural love requires transcendence: the ability to overlook an offense, to give up my ""right"" to justice, and to see the world (and my place in it) from a larger point of view. To be ""transcendent"" means not only to acknowledge that there are things in the world that are bigger than me (for example, God and gravity) but to live for the larger things -- which means having the humility to yield to these higher ideals.Bishop Myriel's character personifies this divine humility, the ability to see others, even the likes of a thief, as better (or, from a transcendent perspective, ""bigger"") than himself. The bishop saw the greater good at stake: not just one man's soul hanging in the balance, but the lives of many others touched by Jean Valjean's wake. Even without this ripple effect, however, one man's life was more than enough for the bishop to relinquish his ""right"" to justice, anger, hurt feelings, offense or retaliation. There was no guarantee Jean Valjean would become a changed man, but transcendent love supersedes momentary outcomes. The bishop's love was not proud, self-seeking, or easily angered -- and it certainly kept no record of wrongs. As I watched this powerful scene unfold once again, I couldn't help but ask myself if I could be a little more transcendent... today, this week, and this year. To me, the idea of ""transcendence"" has always been a lofty, ethereal concept reserved for saints and spiritual gurus like Gandhi and Mother Teresa -- not a layperson like me. But is it possible to make supernatural love a little more doable by becoming more aware that life is not (just) about me? Am I willing to give up my ""right"" to justice, or even my ""right"" to be offended? When someone wrongs me, can I not only forgive, but respond with kindness rather than gossip or any other form of retaliation? Can I look the other way (literally, ""turn the other cheek"") at an intentional or unintentional offense? Do I have what it takes to give my best silver candlesticks, too? That's the meaning of transcendence.For more by Christie Carmelle Lopez, click here. For more on meditation, click here. "

So, before moving from the East Coast of the United States to an island nation in Southeast Asia, I researched what I needed to know to make it a smooth and smart transition.I checked out the weather. No problem. Summers in the Big Apple can be hot and steamy, so I was well prepared for the equatorial climate and polar-temperature air conditioning of the Lion City. What about language? No problem there, either. New York is about as polylingual as a city can get, plus I speak a couple of other languages, so Singlish and Manglish don't worry me, lah. And the food? Yes, please. This region is a magnet for foodies -- and deservedly so.What about culture? I found plenty of information about the wonderful mix of peoples that have shaped local cultures over the centuries, but I also came across references to something that sounded less ideal: kiasu. It has been described as a mix of selfishness, pushiness, and competitiveness, plus a fear of losing or missing out, and is said to be characteristic of the people of Singapore and Malaysia. My first thought was that this trait doesn't sound particularly unusual or distinctive. In my experience, those are relatively common human characteristics. Besides, I don't trust stereotypes; I prefer to experience things for myself and carry out research if possible.As luck would have it, over the summer of 2012 Havas Worldwide commissioned a massive global consumer study among 10,219 people in 31 countries. Included in the survey were over 500 respondents from Malaysia and Singapore. The survey didn't look specifically at kiasu, but its focus was on attitudes and behaviors related to citizenship and community, so I've been able to see how my new home compares with the rest of the world. The first data point I looked at called into question the purported ""selfishness"" of my new neighbors: Among the global sample, 55 percent of respondents had recycled regularly in the previous 12 months. With so many people living in such a small space, it's not surprising that the Singapore government is keen on recycling or that a solid 56 percent of our Singapore respondents are recyclers. Perhaps more surprising is that a much higher 67 percent of Malaysian respondents recycle. The pattern was similar when I looked at the percentages of respondents who are taking steps to reduce their carbon footprints and/or live in a more environmentally conscious way: Globally, 30 percent of respondents are doing so, as are 28 percent of Singaporeans. Once again, Malaysians came out on top, with nearly 4 in 10 (37 percent) claiming to be living more eco-consciously. What about charitable giving? Globally, just more than half the sample (53 percent) and precisely half of Singaporeans had donated clothing and/or other items to charity in the year prior, as did 56 percent of Malaysians. The numbers dipped when it came to donating money, but they were still highest in Malaysia (44 percent), and this time were higher in Singapore (35 percent) than among the global sample (28 percent).Idealism was strong throughout the sample: Seven in 10 respondents, globally and in Singapore, agreed they have a responsibility to make the world a better place. Nearly 8 in 10 Malaysians (79 percent) said the same.On other pro-social points, the pattern was consistent with what I've detailed so far: Singaporeans responded with roughly similar percentages to the overall sample, while Malaysians responded with higher percentages. And just as in the global sample, Prosumers scored higher on each of these statements than did their mainstream counterparts. (Prosumers are the set of highly motivated and proactive consumers Havas Worldwide has been tracking for more than a decade. They're important to us because of their outsized influence and also because understanding what they're doing and thinking today gives us a good sense of what the mainstream will be doing 6 to 18 months from now.) On all points, Malaysian and Singaporean Prosumers combined were more pro-social than their mainstream counterparts. Many more of them recycle regularly (75 percent of Prosumers vs. 58 percent of the mainstream), have donated clothes and other items to charity (64 percent vs. 50 percent), are taking steps to reduce their carbon footprints (46 percent vs. 29 percent), donate money to causes (47 percent vs. 38 percent), and feel a responsibility to make the world a better place (84 percent vs. 72 percent).Looking at these numbers, I don't have any sense of kiasu showing through. Maybe globalization, the Internet, and broadened prosperity have smoothed it out. Perhaps kiasu is no more than a local myth, like dragons and the Merlion. Maybe I just haven't been in the region long enough to notice it yet -- please feel free to put me straight, either online or in person. In the meantime, I shall be exploring my new home, enjoying the food, and learning what I expect will be an interesting hybrid of Singlish and Manglish.Naomi Troni is the CEO, Southeast Asia at Havas Worldwide.
