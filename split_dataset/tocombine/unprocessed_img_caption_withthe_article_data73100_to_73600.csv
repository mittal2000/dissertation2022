0,LATINO VOICES,Was That Anti-Trump 'SNL' Protest A Success? Depends Who You Ask,Rahel Gebreyes,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-saturday-night-live-deport-racism_us_564260cde4b050814acef57d,"""We made our presence felt and we talked about how hurtful the words that Donald Trump has said about the Latino community [were].""",2015-11-11,"He Called Latino Immigrants ""Criminals"" And ""Rapists""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55e0e21714000077002e4580.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Last Saturday, Donald Trump graced the ""Saturday Night Live"" stage as host, defying the protesters and other groups who had condemned NBC for allowing the 2016 candidate's appearance. Although activists say their work was a success, they remain split over their anti-Trump advocacy work and the tactics that were used to draw attention to the issue. According to campaign manager of DeportRacism.com, Luke Montgomery, his organization achieved the desired effect. Before Trump's controversial appearance, DeportRacism.com, a Latino political action committee focused on ""fighting anti-Latino and anti-immigrant racism in the 2016 election,"" had offered $5,000 to anyone willing to heckle Trump on-air. Larry David unexpectedly obliged -- although, it was part of the scripted opening monologue -- calling Trump a ""racist"" during the broadcast. In an interview with HuffPost Live on Monday, Montgomery said he was happy to see his organization change the conversation about Trump's ""SNL"" appearance.""We love that they actually were forced to incorporate it into the show because they were so terrified that somebody in the audience would take DeportRacism.com up on our offer for the $5,000 bounty to call him a racist,"" he said. ""So it was very unexpected. It may have been a joke, but what he said was true. What it had the effect of doing was creating headlines around the world, and it's been amazing, paring the word 'Trump' with 'racist,' and that is exactly what we wanted to do.""But Brent Wilkes, the national executive director at LULAC, took another position. Wilkes agreed that ""you really shouldn't feature a racist on any type of comedy show,"" but took issue with Montgomery's tactics -- both the $5,000 reward for deriding Trump on air and his obscenity-laced videos. ""Frankly, Mr. Montgomery is primarily interested in promoting his website and his shock videos, and yeah, that's why I think he was delighted that Larry David made fun of the whole thing on 'Saturday Night Live,'"" he told host Alyona Minkovski. ""We're not delighted. We thought it was offensive and yet another blow against the Latino community."" Wilkes said LULAC's protest, where roughly 200 protesters marched down from Fifth Avenue to the ""SNL"" studio at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, in order to rally with additional activists, reaped success in another way.""We made our presence felt and we talked about how hurtful the words that Donald Trump has said about the Latino community [were],"" he said. ""Certainly, the folks at 30 Rockefeller Plaza noticed us. Both the people waiting to go in and watch the performance, as well as all the executives and staff that were inside the tower.""With regard to David's bold proclamation during the ""SNL"" episode, Montgomery said the comedian can expect to see the reward money sometime soon. ""DeportRacism.com is going to pony up, and we're in contact with Mr. David's agents and we're going to give him the $5,000 reward,"" he said. ""We haven't heard back from them yet, but we couldn't be happier with how it helped get the message out about Trump's racism against Latinos.""Hear more about the debate over Trump's ""SNL"" appearance in the HuffPost Live videos above.

He said in a statement that he considers ""nearly all the Republican candidates to be my friends, but [has] determined that Jeb Bush is the most qualified.""""Jeb has the proven leadership skills and executive experience needed to fix the problems facing our country -- from the anemic economy to America's weakened standing among world leaders,"" Dole said.

7,SPORTS,Kobe Hired A Film Crew And We‚Äôre Supposed To Pretend It‚Äôs Not A Clue?,Juliet Spies-Gans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kobe-bryant-film-crew-retirement_us_56434c05e4b060377347110e,"WAKE UP, SHEEPLE.",2015-11-11,A camera man gets a close-up of Bryant as he waits to enter a Lakers home game.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56434e96180000a7003046af.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Something unusual has been happening to Kobe Bryant throughout the first two weeks of the 2015-2016 season: He has received cheers and chants of encouragement on the road, states away from the Staples Center. These rounds of applause seem most equivalent to a final ovation for a bowing performer before he leaves the stage at the end of a show, as it‚Äôs widely assumed that Bryant will retire after this year. But No. 24, seemingly hoping to avoid the Jeter Tour, has refused to definitively state whether he will indeed be hanging it up next spring. Now, however, a few cameras by Kobe‚Äôs side have provided us with the most conclusive proof yet that he will retire before his 38th birthday in August.The proof comes in the heart of Howard Beck‚Äôs recent feature on the long-standing romance between Bryant and New York City. Between flashbacks to Kobe‚Äôs one-time dominance and glances ahead to his life after basketball, Beck gave us this carrot:[Bryant] did hire a film crew to track him all season, filming every move and collecting sound bites in quiet moments. No documentary is planned, Bryant told me. But don‚Äôt be surprised if we see one if this truly is the end.Surely no one would hire a film crew just to record a penultimate season. So this (probably) means Kobe (is pretty sure he) will retire this season, even if he keeps equivocating in front of the media and the throngs of fans. He said just days ago that as of now he will indeed call it quits in a few months -- but actions speak louder than words, and amidst a season of uncertainties for the Lakers, lugging a film crew in tow is the action that speaks the loudest thus far.Also on HuffPost:"

It is also a far cry from the first Republican debate on Fox News, which was the first debate of the election cycle and raked in an astonishing 24 million viewers.But FBN‚Äôs numbers still reflect outsized interest in the current election and represent a major win for the young network, which was founded in 2007. By way of comparison, the highest-rated GOP debate in the 2012 election cycle, which aired on ABC, drew 7.6 million viewers.The network‚Äôs showing should also be considered especially strong given that Fox Business reaches a significantly smaller number of homes than the major networks -- 11 million fewer than CNN, for instance.The ‚Äúundercard‚Äù debate featuring second-tier Republican candidates averaged 4.7 million viewers, with 866,000 in the 25-54 demographic.

Their three most important young players have less than a full NBA season of experience, while their future Hall of Famer, Kobe Bryant, has literally been in the league more than half his life. What may be a surprise, however, is how the 37-year-old Bryant is crippling the youth movement around him.Long gone are the days when Bryant could violently attack the gym. What has unfortunately supplanted those drives has become a series of ineffective isolation moves that typically result in one-and-done basketball: Bryant misses a bad shot, the defense rebounds and he fails to retreat to stop the break. No second-chance points, no real ball movement, no pressure on the defense -- and worst of all, the most 3-pointers he's ever taken.Through six games (he sat out one due to back pain), Bryant is enduring career lows in both field goal percentage (32 percent) and 3-point percentage (21 percent). Maybe more troubling is his 5.5 free-throw attempts per game, the lowest clip since his rookie season, way back in 1996. And therein lies the biggest issue with No. 24. Because he is unable to generate offense efficiently, he is forced to work that much harder for his points. And, because he's Kobe, he's not willing to deviate from what has always made him great -- making plays with the ball in his hands.To the Lakers' credit, the front office has drafted three young prospects, all of whom appear to be oozing with potential. Julius Randle, a former top-10 pick and tireless worker at power forward, broke his leg before last season but has played well so far this year. Jordan Clarkson was a second-round pick in 2014 and can play both guard spots. He is the team's second-leading scorer behind Bryant, at 15.9 points per game. Then there is the prize, 6-foot-5 left-handed point guard D'Angelo Russell, taken second overall last June from Ohio State. While Randle and Clarkson are struggling with the actual definition of their roles, Russell looks downright confused and lost when he's on the floor. Head coach Byron Scott -- a Kobe loyalist who played with him in LA -- hasn't the slightest clue how to take the ball out of Kobe's hands and give it to Russell. Russell was the best pure playmaker in the entire draft, a dynamic open floor talent whose prodigious passing allowed his stock to skyrocket, despite question marks surrounding his prolonged defensive lapses. Moreover, in this massive rebuilding season, Russell's minutes are inconsistent at best. He hardly ever plays in the fourth quarter, even when the game is no longer in doubt. The beauty of having young talent in this league is giving them the tools to develop. That is the head coach's responsibility. For Scott though, doing so -- especially with his backcourt -- would be relinquishing a portion of Bryant's responsibilities, something he's clearly not willing to do.""Just trying to get him the ball in areas that I know he's real comfortable getting the ball,"" Scott told NBA.com. ""Then again, we can't stand around and watch him either. We still got to move on the weak side, still got to set screens. We can't just rely on it to be a home run.""A ""home run"" would be a low-20s usage rate for Bryant. A grand slam would be the 28.7 rate -- tops on the team -- that the Mamba currently has.

In 2012, the operation established by the Koch brothers, as they are known in political parlance, spent millions trying to influence the race, much of it on advertising opposing Democratic President Barack Obama.The duo has built a sprawling political operation to assist Republicans and spread a Libertarian message. In pledging to help Republicans in the general election in 2016, the Kochs set out to build an operation that could provide on-the-ground assistances to the eventual nominee.Using their own money and an aggressive fundraising operation, they developed the umbrella organization Freedom Partners. Within that network is Americans for Prosperity, an organization credited by many as building the Tea Party movement in 2010 that boasts grassroots organizations in each state.(Reporting by Megan Cassella; Editing by Eric Beech and Lisa Shumaker)Also on HuffPost:"

In three of the six performances, Dr. King was portrayed by a black actor; in the other three, a white actor performed the role.Oatman addressed his casting choice when the performance was initially announced. ""I truly wanted to explore the issue of racial ownership and authenticity. I didn‚Äôt want this to be a stunt, but a true exploration of King‚Äôs wish that we all be judged by the content of our character and not the color of our skin,‚Äù he said in a statement. ""I wanted the contrast... I wanted to see how the words rang differently or indeed the same, coming from two different actors, with two different racial backgrounds.""The performances went ahead as planned and seemed to garner little attention after the show closed on October 4.In late October, however, a Twitter user asked ""The Mountaintop"" playwright Katori Hall for her thoughts on the casting choice, which she called ""tone deaf.""A few days later, Howard Sherman, director of the Alliance for Inclusion in the Arts, weighed in as well, noting that news of the performance had started to circulate. ""People are dumbfounded,"" he wrote. ""People are incredulous. People are angry.""While it is quite surprising to imagine Dr. King, or Malala Yousafzai, or Cesar Chavez played by white actors, let‚Äôs remember that we are now in the post-Hamilton era, which suggests to the narrowminded that roles meant for people of color can now be played by white actors if traditionally (or historically) white characters can be played by actors of color. I would, and frequently do, argue that this is a false equivalency.On Monday, Katori Hall addressed the issue at length in an essay for The Root. She called Oatman's casting ""dangerously distorted,"" an experiment that ""proved to be a self-serving and disrespectful directing exercise.""Black writers dedicated to using black bodies, who remain at the center of a devalued narrative, are committing a revolutionary act. We are using theater to demand a witnessing... The casting of a white King is committing yet another erasure of the black body. Sure, it might be in the world of pretend, but it is disrespectful nonetheless, especially to a community that has rare moments of witnessing itself, both creatively and literally, in the world. [...] Hall added that a new stipulation has been included in the licensing agreement for her play: ""Both characters are intended to be played by actors who are African-American or Black. Any other casting choice requires the prior approval of the author.""Also on HuffPost:"

Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) skirted a question on Wednesday of whether he would deport the millions of parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents who would be offered protection under the president's deportation relief program.The GOP presidential candidate said the policy, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA, would be eliminated under his presidency and that the laws would be enforced.It was the type of politician-speak that's become typical of his remarks on immigration -- possible to interpret either as a call for parents to be deported or just a broad statement of the need for more people to be deported.He was asked on CBS's ""This Morning"" whether he was for deporting DAPA-eligible immigrants and initially didn't answer.""This is a tough issue because you're talking about human beings and real lives,"" he said. ""The flip side of it is you're talking about the law. I mean, this country has a right to have immigration laws. And it needs to enforce those laws, or you don't have laws. No one has a right to illegally immigrate to the United States. So look, this is an issue that's very difficult.""Host Norah O'Donnell asked him to clarify whether he ""would see those 4 million-plus immigrants deported."" Since DAPA was an executive action, the next president will have the power to end it.""We need to enforce our law, and I do not support DAPA,"" Rubio said. ""It's unconstitutional, it's the wrong way to do this, and quite frankly, we need to begin to enforce our immigration laws in this country or we don't have immigration laws.""DAPA is currently blocked in the courts, and suffered a blow on Monday when an appeals court maintained an injunction that prevented it from moving forward. The Justice Department announced Tuesday it will appeal to the Supreme Court.The courts have also stopped an expansion of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, which allows undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children to stay and obtain temporary work permits. The original DACA program, which began in 2012, is still running, and Rubio has been criticized over his statements on whether he would end it as president. He has said he would prefer to end DACA and enact immigration reform to deal with the issue instead, but said last week that even without congressional action, he would do away with the program.Rubio was one of the authors of a comprehensive immigration reform bill that passed the Senate in 2013 and later died in the House. The bill would have allowed certain undocumented immigrants to remain in the U.S. and eventually gain citizenship.He now says he still supports eventually allowing some undocumented people to gain legal status -- which could, depending on how legislation was drafted, also allow eventual citizenship -- but that border security measures should come first.Rubio said Wednesday that he would support deporting recent border-crossers, the same position the Obama administration has taken.""I don't oppose deporting people that haven't been in this country for a very long time,"" Rubio said on ""This Morning.""

His most cerebral role yet, Segel plays David Foster Wallace during the author's promotion of the 1996 magnum opus Infinite Jest in the film. But don't assume that means ""Billion Brick Race"" -- the ""Lego Movie"" spinoff he's co-writing -- is a cinch. Segel is familiar with the ""funny guy does drama"" narrative, as he starred in the Duplass brothers' 2012 indie ""Jeff, Who Lives at Home,"" and because almost every comedian is subjected to it eventually. But now the 35-year-old multihyphenate must turn his attention to Oscar chatter and all the other mixed blessings that come with giving one of the year's most acclaimed performances. We gabbed with Segel about playing Wallace, navigating awards buzz and why he no longer consumes entertainment news.I've been hoping to catch you since I saw the movie at Sundance in January. Does it feel like you lived in the world of ""The End of the Tour"" a long time ago?You know, it‚Äôs funny -- this has been a really unique experience for me in the way that it‚Äôs unfolded because we shot it in February of last year and then we waited for Sundance, so that was pretty close to a year wait. And then after Sundance we waited until August for it to come out, and now it‚Äôs getting ready for the DVD release, which, for a movie this size, is a little bit like the wide release. People are going to get a chance to see it who didn‚Äôt otherwise. It‚Äôs been a really slow and interesting unfolding for me.Have you been writing ‚ÄúBillion Brick Race‚Äù throughout the whole thing?Yeah, I‚Äôm writing a few things, actually. I‚Äôm writing that, and then I also write this series of books for middle-grade kids called Nightmares. I‚Äôve been writing the second and third in those series, and I‚Äôve been writing a couple of screenplays, as well.Is it weird to vacillate between writing kid-centric projects and fielding heavy questions about playing David Foster Wallace? It‚Äôs interesting, the headspace you get into with something like ‚ÄúEnd of the Tour,‚Äù I think, is best in low doses. So it was actually kind of nice to go from ‚ÄúEnd of the Tour‚Äù to working on ‚ÄúLego.‚Äù It wiped the slate clean a little bit because, as you can imagine, that was a pretty intense experience. There's always a certain novelty to seeing funny performers do dramatic work. Did you see yourself existing in a comedic realm before people informed you that you had just done a dramatic performance? Oh, I was fully aware of what the tone of the movie was -- it‚Äôs part of what made it so terrifying to do. You have these beliefs about yourself. I definitely felt like I was capable, but the reality is that once you‚Äôre given the opportunity, you‚Äôre faced with this possibility that you‚Äôre going to prove yourself wrong. That‚Äôs a scary thing, but I‚Äôve been of the mind lately that you walk toward the things you‚Äôre scared of.The second extension of this is Oscar chatter, which seems noisy and intrusive in its own right. It‚Äôs only November, so we have a ways to go before it ends in late February. I heard you on Vanity Fair‚Äôs Oscar podcast recently, so you must be willing to play the game, at least to some degree. Well, the way I view it is that I‚Äôm very proud of what we achieved with the movie. My real feeling now is anything that encourages people to see the movie and to pick up David Foster Wallace‚Äôs writing is stuff I‚Äôm really excited to be a part of. It‚Äôs very flattering that people have responded to the performance the way they did. I think it would be untruthful to say that wasn‚Äôt a very exciting thing.Absolutely. Do you read that sort of stuff? Are you familiar with all the prognosticating?No, it‚Äôs funny you ask. I made a decision quite a few years ago to sort of remove myself from entertainment news. Not that I‚Äôm above it, but more that I would over-focus on it. I found the best thing for me is to just focus on what‚Äôs actually going on in my life and in my immediate surroundings.Was there a moment you can recall where you said, ""I‚Äôm not doing this anymore""?I think there‚Äôs probably a frustration that can happen. It goes back to our earlier conversation. You‚Äôre you, and in terms of just where you are work-wise, you‚Äôre ahead of what other people know. I just always have found it a frustrating thing to read uninformed opinions. It‚Äôs sort of distracting from living your actual life and doing what‚Äôs right in front of you.It's tough when other people create a narrative for you. Did you feel you weren't given adequate opportunity to respond to what was being said about you?No, I actually found that when I disengaged from entertainment news, everything was just fine [laughs]. Does that make sense? I think as a reader of the stuff or as the subject of the stuff, you can be drawn into the idea that something is actually happening. Magically, if you don‚Äôt pay attention to it, nothing is actually happening. Your life just continues.And even when things are happening, seeing two dozen news outlets say the same thing can make it seem so much noisier than it actually is. Yeah. I‚Äôm lucky to have people in my life who I really trust and who know me well who, over the course of the ‚ÄúEnd of the Tour‚Äù process, have told me little snippets of lovely things that were written. That sort of stuff is perfect and wonderful and flattering in the right dosage.How do you temper that praise? Surely those people you love aren‚Äôt feeding you the negative stuff, as well. It's helpful not to overindulge in the positive either. I‚Äôve found in my life it‚Äôs nice just to stay right in the center. Don‚Äôt let the highs get too high or the lows get too low, and just put one foot in front of the other.It's interesting that the studio is going to promote your performance as a supporting role for the Oscars. Even though it isn't a conventional cradle-to-grave biopic, you and Jesse Eisenberg are co-leads, so it feels like a bit of category fraud to me. How do you see it?I feel very comfortable with it. I always viewed it as a supporting part, if that‚Äôs helpful to the discussion. Jesse‚Äôs in the movie for 20 or so minutes longer than I am. David Foster Wallace is the subject of the movie, so it feels that way, but it really is David Lipsky‚Äôs story, I think. I think ‚ÄúWhiplash‚Äù is a good example of a similar dynamic.Another debate that‚Äôs crept up is whether David Foster Wallace would have wanted a movie made about him at all. Some people who feel they knew him have essentially called this blasphemous. What do you make of that? I think you want to make movies that don‚Äôt have 100 percent level of agreement. I think something like ‚ÄúToy Story‚Äù should have 100 percent on Rotten Tomatoes, but I think a movie about complicated subjects should spark a discussion from people on both sides.What do you think of the idea that a literary critic or a film critic can feel he or she has enough ownership over DFW‚Äôs legacy to say whether or not this film is worthy?First of all, and this is after a lot of thought, I have great empathy and respect and love, frankly, for the fact that David Foster Wallace has people who love him in varying capacities. I understand that is a very complicated situation. I personally think the movie is less about the life of David Foster Wallace and more an exploration of the themes that he wrote about, so I felt very comfortable. I read Infinite Jest, and I read it hard and thoroughly before we started, and to me, the movie is an extension of those themes. This movie cements how much your career has spanned the whole gamut. You‚Äôve done a beloved show that didn‚Äôt survive and a show that was very mainstream for a long time. You‚Äôve done movies that generate $100 or $200 million at the box office, and with this, a movie that, on paper, doesn‚Äôt appear to have grossed much. It‚Äôs ‚Äúniche,‚Äù as people say. Despite the great r√©sum√© that gives you, as a producer, is it a bummer there isn‚Äôt more of a happy medium in terms of what makes a dent culturally? I‚Äôve been doing this for 18 years now, amazingly. I‚Äôm 35 years old and one of the things I‚Äôve learned is about adjusting the criteria for success. If you do a big-budget studio comedy, part of the expectation is that it‚Äôs going to make a lot of money at the box office. When you do a movie like ‚ÄúEnd of the Tour‚Äù for so little -- the budget of the movie is $3 million or something like that -- I think the criteria for success is that people see it and it moves them. In that regard, I think it‚Äôs been a mission accomplished. You take ‚ÄúFreaks and Geeks‚Äù versus ‚ÄúHow I Met Your Mother‚Äù -- both of those feel like huge successes to me. The goal is always to tell good stories, but do you think there is a steep difference in making those two types of projects -- in getting an ‚ÄúEnd of the Tour‚Äù off the ground versus getting a ‚ÄúForgetting Sarah Marshall‚Äù off the ground?It‚Äôs an interesting question. I‚Äôm pausing so I can give you a good answer. I look back at ‚ÄúForgetting Sarah Marshall‚Äù and it actually felt pretty similar in that I was scared. I was really scared going into both of them, and I think that‚Äôs a really good place to start because it drives you to make sure everything is as good as it can possibly be. I think the landscape of movies is changing. It‚Äôs become very polarized. There are the big tentpole movies that you hope make $100 million or more, and then there‚Äôs this art-house, independent kind of film, which is where interesting, smaller movies can be made. I think the middle area of movies has moved to television. So I think there is a changing landscape, but there‚Äôs room to do interesting stuff in both places.You mentioned working on different scripts lately, so when you decide to tackle something, do you feel like you have to figure out what piece of the pie it will fit into? In other words, do you have to begin with a sense of whether it's studio movie and how it will be marketed and what audience it serves? That‚Äôs really interesting you ask. I‚Äôve been doing a lot of thinking about that over the past couple of years. When ""How I Met Your Mother"" ended and I started to think about how I wanted to proceed for this next phase of my career, I think the more strategic I‚Äôve gotten the less creative I feel. So, for me, I am focusing on, ‚ÄúWhat do I watch at night?‚Äù And then when I think of an idea, ""Would I want to watch this?"" And that‚Äôs really all I can focus on.So what do you watch at night?Oh man, the last few things that I watched that I loved were ‚ÄúFrank"" and I loved ‚ÄúRoom.‚Äù It‚Äôs so good. I loved ‚ÄúOnly Lovers Left Alive.‚Äù I just saw that and it is gorgeous.Final Oscar question: If you were to get that supporting nomination, there‚Äôs a good chance you could be up against your pal Seth Rogen. So what kind of rivalry are you guys in store for in these upcoming months?Oh, I would just think that would be the most amazing journey ever. I wouldn‚Äôt view that as a rivalry one bit. I would be really proud of the both of us.A friendly rivalry, of course.Of course, but I think, for me, I would just feel tremendous pride in the both of us. We met when we were teenagers!""The End of the Tour"" is now available on DVD/Blu-ray and digitally. This interview has been edited and condensed. Also on HuffPost:"

16,BUSINESS,This U.S. City Is Welcoming Veterans With An Innovative New Program,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-city-welcoming-veterans_us_56411312e4b0b24aee4b70c5,"The Where Opportunity Knox initiative is connecting Army veterans to jobs and community life in the greater Louisville, Kentucky, area.",2015-11-11,"Fred Johnson, a career Army officer, found a job as a fundraiser at Louisville's Fund for the Arts thanks to Where Opportunity Knox.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56411e621400006f023ca4e0.jpeg?cache=3F4xLJz7gh&ops=crop_0_3_960_529%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Fred Johnson is effusive.After a 29-year career in the Army, including three combat tours, he has moved on to a dream job as a fundraiser for a nonprofit -- in Louisville, Kentucky, a city he loves.I can hear the excitement in his voice as he tells me I must visit Louisville.‚ÄúYou‚Äôve gotta come, dude -- it‚Äôs awesome,‚Äù Johnson told me. ‚ÄúThis is an up-and-coming town.‚ÄùBut Johnson might not have been able to find the job and community of his dreams were it not for Where Opportunity Knox, an innovative new veterans re-integration program.Last year, Johnson was one of more than 100,000 soldiers leaving active duty Army service. Every single one of them passes through Fort Knox before re-entering the civilian world.Those Army veterans are looking for jobs and communities where they can begin a new life as civilians. The greater Louisville, Kentucky, area where Fort Knox is located has a vibrant cultural scene and growing economy in need of capable workers and young families.Until recently, however, there was no coordinated effort to connect the soon-to-be civilians in Fort Knox with job opportunities and communal life in Louisville.So in September 2014, three regional chambers of commerce launched Where Opportunity Knox to try to change that. The program has the enthusiastic backing of the U.S. Army, but it does not take a dime from the government. It relies exclusively on funding from philanthropic foundations. And it has already racked up some impressive numbers. Where Opportunity Knox claims credit for connecting 1,500 veterans to jobs in the region already. And it has the goal of navigating 10,000 veterans to jobs in the greater Louisville area by 2017.Filling A VoidThe transition to civilian life for soldiers being processed at Fort Knox has two stages, according to retired Col. Walter Herd, the director of the Army‚Äôs Transition Assistance Program: preparation for a career outside the Army and connection to opportunities in the civilian world.The Army spends two weeks on the first part, Herd said, helping soldiers with ‚Äúeverything from their own personal and psychological understanding, to their budgetary needs, culminating with a r√©sum√© and job preparation.‚ÄùConnecting those soldiers to a career and community is how Where Opportunity Knox complements the Army‚Äôs work. Representatives of the group are often on premises at training sessions in Fort Knox to assess soldiers' needs and answer questions. They advertise their availability to talk by email or phone on RallyPoint, an internal military professional networking site.Where Opportunity Knox emphasizes that it is not a job placement program. It just gives veterans the personal support, insight and connections to the employer community that they are less likely to find on, say, Monster.com.In addition to a team of several permanent staff members, Where Opportunity Knox uses a proverbial army of ‚Äúregional veteran connectors‚Äù -- 35 trained volunteers -- to help veterans identify job opportunities in the region, and a local community to live in that meets their needs. The latter component means helping veterans identify everything from a quiet neighborhood to buy a home to educational services for children with disabilities to adult recreational sports leagues. Herd said there is no veterans reintegration program in the United States as comprehensive as Where Opportunity Knox.‚ÄúThe Army does not owe it to a soldier to get them a job, but we believe we do owe it to a soldier to get them ready and get ‚Äòem introduced to something on the outside so they can at least begin that conversation,‚Äù Herd said. ‚ÄúThe preparation piece is the easy part, the hard part is the connection piece. I‚Äôm excited about Where Opportunity Knox because it connects them not just to a job, but to a community.‚ÄùThe feeling is mutual. For Kentucky‚Äôs business community, Where Opportunity Knox is a portal to a pool of reliable, skilled workers that they say would otherwise be lacking.‚ÄúAs economic developers, workforce is a challenge,‚Äù said Eileen Pickett, an economic consultant and co-founder of Where Opportunity Knox. ‚ÄúWe have this ongoing problem and certainly now since we‚Äôve gotten past the recession, we‚Äôre starting to see growth and we need people with the right skills.‚ÄùThe population of the greater Louisville area has grown 2.8 percent since 2010 -- in no small part due to its relatively successful recovery from the Great Recession.Unemployment in the Louisville metropolitan area went from a peak of 11.9 percent in February 2010 to 4 percent today. That is a better record than the country as a whole, which went from a peak official jobless rate of 10 percent in October 2009 to 5 percent today.The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis points to the greater Louisville area as a model for successful diversification of what was once a primarily industrial economy. The city and surrounding areas now also boast a thriving service sector.Louisville proper is home to UPS‚Äô Worldport air hub, as well as two Ford production plants and the corporate headquarters of health insurance giant Humana. And while the city is known for its bourbon distilleries -- think Maker‚Äôs Mark, Woodford Reserve and Evan Williams -- it is also the base of Yum! Brands, parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.Army veterans are ideal candidates for the mid- and high-skill jobs that make the region‚Äôs businesses tick, Herd and Pickett insist.For one thing, a person must be healthy, free of a criminal record and have completed high school to get into the Army in the first place.Soldiers then learn concrete skills in the Army that often translate into civilian occupations -- everything from truck driving to supply chain management to computer science.But more valuable than the skills the Army teaches soldiers are the ‚Äúattributes‚Äù that service instills, Herd said. Soldiers are virtually guaranteed to develop discipline, a collaborative spirit and an ability to think on their feet before they emerge from Fort Knox‚Äôs walls to return to the civilian world.And those are often the intangible qualities that make people reliable employees and innovators.‚ÄúThe military is pretty much a pre-screening event for employers, because all employers want the same people, right? They graduated school, they‚Äôre healthy, they stay out of trouble,‚Äù Herd said. ‚ÄúSo we take those people and we train them and discipline them and mature them and we steal them for a few years and then we give them back to society.‚ÄùThe Visit To An Army Base That Inspired A New InitiativePickett got the idea for the program after taking a group tour of Fort Irwin, the Army‚Äôs training center in California. There she saw the life-size replicas of entire towns in Afghanistan and Iraq that soldiers trained in before being deployed to war zones overseas.It is the crucible that turns young high-school graduates into hardened adults, ready to face unknown physical and mental challenges in a foreign nation.‚ÄúWhat was so striking to me -- this was really my first kind of up close with the military -- I remember this captain who told us, their job is to make every soldier that comes through there have their worst day in the service happen at Fort Irwin so it doesn‚Äôt happen somewhere else,‚Äù Pickett said.To Pickett, it was obvious that any soldiers that underwent training at that base -- let alone the experiences that followed -- would make for terrific employees and members of the community. If they could make it through Fort Irwin, wouldn‚Äôt they make a superb supply chain manager for UPS?‚ÄúI wish every American could go through there,‚Äù Pickett said. ‚ÄúI was just inspired by it.‚ÄùTranslating ‚ÄúArmy-Speak‚Äù To ‚ÄúCorporate-Speak‚ÄùGiven how intuitively appealing these veterans sound as employees, one would think veterans would have a relatively low unemployment rate.But unemployment among young, post-9/11 veterans has been higher than among their non-veteran peers.In 2014, the unemployment rate among post-9/11 veterans was 7.2 percent, compared with 6 percent among non-veterans. For post-9/11 veterans ages 18 to 24, the jobless rate was 16.2 percent, compared with 12.5 percent among non-veterans of the same age. (The figures have since declined, but on the advice of the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we are using annual data here for greatest possible accuracy.)The reasons are complicated. The high incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury among returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans no doubt plays a role -- though that may be more due to employers‚Äô stigmas about the conditions than their actual effects.There are other factors, however, that have more to do with the military‚Äôs separation from civilian society. The networks that soldiers rely on to advance in the military often do not extend into the civilian world. As a result, it is hard to make professional connections with peers in the civilian world that are so essential to finding a job in today‚Äôs economy.Herd believes that departing soldiers are also sometimes unsure how to present the broader attributes they acquire in the military as professional assets in the civilian world.Kathy Robinson, founder of TurningPoint, a Boston-based career counseling firm, and a former human resources executive, has worked alongside veterans, recruited them to work for companies and advised them on finding work.‚ÄúVeterans bring a lot to the table when it comes to collaboration, ability to assess a vision and execute on that vision. When I was working with veterans they were often the most effective people in their jobs,‚Äù Robinson said. ‚ÄúThe hard part comes in translating those skills from Army/Navy-speak to corporate-speak, and explaining how military service-specific skills are universally applicable.‚ÄùIn fact, those with the most easily translatable skills often have a harder time realizing the value of the attributes they have honed in the military -- let alone communicating them in terms employers can easily grasp. Herd notes that machine gunners and infantrymen, who worked in positions that do not exist in the civilian world, are less likely to be unemployed than Army truck drivers, who can easily become civilian truck drivers.‚ÄúYou Can Actually See The Community Change.‚ÄùJohnson, the Army vet, sees another challenge in the transition to civilian life. Like many veterans, Johnson wanted a job that provided him with a sense of purpose like the kind he enjoyed in the Army.Given Johnson‚Äôs worries about the applicability of his Army skills in the civilian world altogether, he did not think he would have the luxury of finding a job that fit that description.That was before he met with the folks at Where Opportunity Knox.They told him about an opening at Fund for the Arts, a Louisville nonprofit that raises money for arts supplies and programs in Louisville‚Äôs underprivileged schools. Johnson is now the organization‚Äôs director of workplace giving.‚ÄúI had a certain idea in mind for what I wanted to do and they helped me work through that,‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúThey helped me learn how to go through the civilian interview process. I knew what I wanted and they helped me articulate that in a way that made sense.‚ÄùThrough his work at Fund for the Arts, Johnson sees himself as part of a process of community building in the underserved west side of Louisville. He compares it to the reconstruction work he did in the Iraqi city of Baquba after the Army brigade he led helped conquer it.‚ÄúWhen we attacked that city it was like a wasteland,‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúThen we helped rebuild the city. We are trying to do that here in Louisville. On the west side, it is almost barren -- it almost reminds me of Baquba.‚ÄùIn addition to the Army instilling in him a desire to be a part of something greater than himself, Johnson said his service equipped him with communication skills and a comfort with diversity of all kinds. Both of those characteristics are assets to him in his fundraising work.‚ÄúThe vast majority of people in the Army -- unless you don‚Äôt do your work, who cares? Same thing with a female, a gay person, or any ethnic or racial minority,‚Äù Johnson added. ‚ÄúThe west side [of Louisville] is very poor and racially diverse. I fit in as well there as at Humana or Brown-Forman where everybody is wearing suits.‚ÄùBut Johnson said he was also fortunate that Fund for the Arts was willing to give him an opportunity to prove himself despite his lack of formal fundraising experience -- and struggles with post-traumatic stress disorder from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan.‚ÄúI told [Fund for the Arts CEO] Christen Boone, this is what [my PTSD] means and this is what I am doing to overcome it,‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúI said I am bringing more positive baggage than negative. She took a chance on me. I wish more CEOs and executives had the courage.‚ÄùAnd prove himself Johnson has. Local magazine Business First recently named him one of Louisville‚Äôs top 20 veterans in business.Now Johnson is using his experience to help younger returning veterans find their way. He volunteers with a joint civilian-military initiative called Arts and Healing. The group uses art to help veterans cope with PTSD.‚ÄúI tell them, ‚ÄòFollow your heart, not the money,‚Äù Johnson said. ‚ÄúYou can actually see the community change.‚ÄùWhere Opportunity Knox helped give Johnson the confidence that the skills he acquired in the Army had prepared him well for a civilian career. He explains to younger veterans that they too have attained those skills, even if they do not yet know it.‚ÄúA lot of time the younger kids do not realize what they‚Äôve learned,‚Äù he observed. ‚ÄúThey are 21 years old -- I say, ‚ÄòNo, dude, you experienced a lifetime in that short span. You just don‚Äôt realize how many tools you have.‚Äô‚ÄùAlso on HuffPost:"

18,POLITICS,Chris Christie Video Shows That GOP Empathy Is Real -- And Limited,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chris-christie-video-republican-empathy_us_5641546ce4b0b24aee4ba1e6,"Why the GOP isn't so forgiving with the uninsured, the unemployed or the poor.",2015-11-10,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7e4ec1d00003000143032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"The famous video of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie talking about addiction is a sign of how much Republican Party attitudes toward vulnerable people have changed.It‚Äôs also a reminder of how much those attitudes have stayed the same.If you follow politics, you probably have seen or heard about Christie‚Äôs appearance at a New Hampshire tavern late last month, where he was campaigning for the GOP presidential nomination. In response to a question about illegal drug use, Christie said society should help addicts, not demonize them. To make his point, he talked movingly about two people in his life -- his mother, who couldn‚Äôt stop smoking even though she knew it was killing her, and a law school friend, who became addicted to painkillers after an injury and eventually took his own life. Nobody questions trying to treat smokers like his mother, Christie explained. So why should anybody question trying to treat people with different kinds of addictions? ‚ÄúWe have to stop judging and start giving them the tools they need to get better,‚Äù Christie said.The Huffington Post posted footage of the soliloquy, which runs about six minutes. The video went viral about a week ago and, since that time, nearly 8 million people have watched it online. It‚Äôs likely that millions more have seen excerpts on television. The raw authenticity of the moment has quite obviously struck a chord. But it‚Äôs likely that the message has, too.Politicians know this. Not so long ago, candidates for office wooed voters by promising severe, mandatory sentences for illegal drug use. Now, they boast about their compassion toward addicts -- even in the Republican primary, where voters have long favored tougher, less-forgiving approaches to crime. One reason for the transformation is practical. Filling jails with nonviolent offenders has turned out to be very expensive. The other reason is personal. Large numbers of Americans have seen first hand how addiction strikes -- and, more important, they have seen who it strikes. They see neighbors, friends, and family struggling. And while they don‚Äôt hold these addicts blameless, they also understand that many people struggling with drugs are victims of bad luck -- the kind of misfortune that, as Christie put it, ‚Äúcould happen to anyone.‚Äù‚ÄúThere but for the grace of God, go I,‚Äù Christie said.Of course, Christie could have used those same sentences to describe other people. He could have been talking about the unemployed or the uninsured, people who fell behind on mortgage payments or people who have dropped out of school. The Americans experiencing those kinds of misfortune are just like the addicts Christie discussed so poignantly in that video -- neither wholly blameless nor wholly responsible for their fates. Look into the ranks of the jobless and you‚Äôll find all kinds of people -- some who frittered away good positions because they didn‚Äôt work hard, some who got pink slips because their employers shifted operations overseas, and plenty whose circumstances are somewhere in between those extremes. Spend time in a community medical clinic and you‚Äôll find people who opted not to buy health insurance that they could have afforded -- or put off medical care when they had a chance to get it. Alongside them, you‚Äôll see people unable to get coverage because it was too expensive or unavailable to them because of pre-existing medical conditions. But you rarely hear Republicans invoke Christie's forgiving, empathetic language when describing these people. On the contrary, for several decades, the GOP‚Äôs rhetoric has tilted in the other direction, ostracizing the poor, the downtrodden, and the marginalized. That‚Äôs how it was in 1980, when Ronald Reagan was attacking ‚Äúwelfare queens,‚Äù and that‚Äôs how it was in 2012, when Mitt Romney was bemoaning the ‚Äú47 percent‚Äù of Americans on some kind of federal assistance.And these aren't just slogans. Republicans have fought repeatedly to limit government programs, whether by limiting eligibility for food stamps and housing vouchers or by rolling back Obamacare. One big reason for that is the perception, which Republican leaders and voters share, that the poor people who benefit from these programs are ‚Äútakers‚Äù instead of ‚Äúmakers‚Äù -- and that they don‚Äôt deserve so much ‚Äúfree stuff.‚ÄùTo be clear, Reagan and Romney and the other Republicans also had more practical concerns about the efficacy of the welfare state -- like whether providing benefits to the poor discourages them from working, or whether, in a time of constrained budgets, the federal government must simply be more thrifty. But Republicans used to make similar arguments when they justified harsh sentences for drug crimes. They‚Äôre relenting now because they know the victims -- because, suddenly, suffering has become personal. They don‚Äôt see the other groups of vulnerable people in the same way.This pattern, of Republicans selectively supporting beneficiaries they know well, is a familiar one. After Hurricane Sandy struck the Northeast in 2012, for example, Republicans from other parts of the country tried to block large chunks of federal aid because, they said, it would be fiscally irresponsible. But when floods hit Texas, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who helped lead the fight against Sandy aid, sought federal assistance for his constituents. Sen. Lindsay Graham (R-S.C.), who also opposed Sandy relief, begged for help when his home state of South Carolina needed it.It‚Äôs the same underlying dynamic that famously drove Rob Portman, the Republican senator from Ohio, to change his views on same-sex marriage. Like most conservatives, Portman had opposed it -- until his son came out of the closet. ‚ÄúIt allowed me to think of this issue from a new perspective, and that's of a dad who loves his son a lot,‚Äù Portman said at the time.Portman's change of heart on same-sex marriage, like Christie's determination to help addicts, is a sign of empathy. But that empathy clearly has limits. It stops when the misfortune or marginalization is no longer something these conservative politicians can understand personally.Also on HuffPost:"

Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.).",2015-11-10,Rep. Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) is backing a bipartisan bill to turn veteran bars into wellness centers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56421d9b14000069023ca5a5.jpeg?ops=crop_9_82_4614_2417%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- With the nation marking Veterans Day Wednesday, a bipartisan group of lawmakers is urging Congress to take a deep breath, exhale, and be more mindful -- of what it can do to help America's warriors.The push towards wellness and mindfulness to reduce stress is increasingly popular in America, and not exactly new. But it has yet to gain deeper traction among the slow-to-change political class in Washington. Reps. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), Glenn Thompson (R-Pa.) and a handful of other lawmakers think it's time for Congress to open its mind, at least a little.One way would be to pass a bill called the Veterans Wellness Act, which aims to transform some of those old VFW and American Legion posts from the dark, dingy watering holes of yore into more light-filled spaces, welcoming not just to vets, but to their families and communities. It would remake at least 10 into the kinds of places where former military fighters are as apt to find a barre as a bar, and where meditation is not about staring into the bottom of a glass.It's not that lawmakers want to go all Anti-Saloon League on former service members, but they think that modern veterans, who are already trying to take a more holistic approach, could do with a little help updating the 20th century-style gathering spots of their fathers and grandfathers.""It‚Äôs a different world. Those people worked in steel mills and auto plants, and they got their physical activity at work. And their bonding experience came afterwards at a bar, or a facility like that,"" said Ryan, who has become something of a champion of mindfulness. ""Today, people sit at a desk. So they need some exercise when they get done with work, and these veterans are the same.""You might expect Ryan, who's written a book on meditation, to embrace such an idea. Yet, so has Thompson, who is more of a burly, old-school sort of Republican. He comes to the need to do better by vets at least in part after a career in health care. He also has a son who was injured serving in Iraq and made sure his congressman father knew about the challenges of returning troops.""When you look at some of the struggles our veterans are dealing with, the suicide rates, it just is common sense,"" Thompson told The Huffington Post. ""And it‚Äôs cost-effective because it‚Äôs a great example of a public-private partnership where you work with the American Legions and the other veterans service organizations.""The bill tells the Veterans Administration to work with those service organizations to ""upgrade, through construction and repair, VSO community facilities into health and wellness centers and to promote and expand complementary and integrative wellness programs.""It's not a foreign concept to the VA, which has done it's own studies on the effectiveness and lower cost of less traditional methods, and found them to help, especially for things like post-traumatic stress.""What we‚Äôve heard from some of these vets who have gone through these programs is they go from 12 down to two or three meds a day,"" Ryan said, noting that standard strategies to help veterans cope end up medicating them for decades.It's Congress that needs persuading.Thompson, a member of the majority party in the GOP-led House, is not a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee, but he's sponsored a slew of veteran-related bills. A spokesman said Thompson was able to meet recently with the chairman of the committee, Rep. Jeff Miller (R-Fla.) to make the case.It is unclear what will come of that, and a committee source said there aren't yet plans to proceed on the Wellness Act.For Ryan and Thompson, a good first step would be a hearing, where committee members hear directly from veterans.""Say what you may about the settings, but there is a really, I think, therapeutic quality to that,"" Thompson said. ""And they are already engaged in these types of programs. It just expands on it.""""The committee has got to listen to the vets,"" Ryan said. ""I‚Äôm hoping that people on the Veterans Affairs Committee who are looking for ways to save money, looking for ways to help vets, will open their minds up to things that are actually working. And these are the things that are actually working."" Also on HuffPost:Michael McAuliff covers Congress and politics for The Huffington Post. Talk to him on Facebook."
