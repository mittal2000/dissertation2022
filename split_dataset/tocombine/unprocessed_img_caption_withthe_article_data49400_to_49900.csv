Jamaat-ur-Ahrar is the same faction that carried out a bombing in the city of Lahore in March, killing 72 people at a park filled with children and families.The self-described Islamic State also claimed to have carried out the attack, according to a statement from their Amaq news agency. Abdul Rehman Miankhel, a senior official at the government-run Civil Hospital, where the explosion occurred, told reporters that at least 63 people had been killed, with more than 50 wounded, as the casualty toll spiked from initial estimates.“There are many wounded, so the death toll could rise,” said Rehmat Saleh Baloch, the provincial health minister.Television footage showed scenes of chaos, with panicked people fleeing through debris as smoke filled the hospital corridors.The motive behind the attack was unclear, but several lawyers have been targeted during a recent spate of killings in Quetta.The latest victim, Bilal Anwar Kasi, was shot and killed while on his way to the city’s main court complex, senior police official Nadeem Shah told Reuters. He was the president of Baluchistan Bar Association.The subsequent suicide attack appeared to target his mourners, Anwar ul Haq Kakar, a spokesman for the Baluchistan government, said.“It seems it was a pre-planned attack,” he said.Police cordoned off the hospital following the blast.Aside from a long-running separatist insurgency, and sectarian tensions, Baluchistan also suffers from rising crime.In January, a suicide bomber killed 15 people outside a polio eradication center in an attack claimed by both the Pakistani Taliban and Jundullah, another Islamist militant group that has pledged allegience to Islamic State in the Middle East.Quetta has also long been regarded as a base for the Afghan Taliban, whose leadership has regularly held meetings there in the past.In May, Afghan Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour was killed by a U.S. drone strike while traveling to Quetta from the Pakistan-Iran border."

A group of Paris restaurants is turning food scraps into biogas and compost ahead of a new law that will force thousands of French food outlets to recycle their organic waste. Some 80 restaurants, caterers and hotels, signed up for a pilot project to collect their food waste, which is used to generate biogas and produce electricity and heat, as well as compost for farms around Paris. Martinez, who took the initiative for the project, said the collection anticipates the law but that participating restaurants are happy that someone collects their waste and puts it to good use. REUTERS/Charles Platiau",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a898252a00000002fb54d6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ROME, Aug 8 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - When Italian architect Carlo de Sanctis went to a friend’s wedding on the outskirts of Rome two years ago, he did not expect to find himself discussing food waste.As the party was winding down, de Sanctis and his friends ended up wondering what the waiter next to them would do with the uneaten food he had started to collect.“We asked him what they were going do with all this leftover food and he showed us the garbage. We couldn’t believe all this excellent food would simply get wasted,” he said, still in disbelief.De Sanctis felt compelled to act. With his friends, two lawyers and a web designer, he set up Equoevento, a Rome-based non-profit that collects uneaten food from events and delivers it to charities for distribution to the hungry.“On one side you have so much leftover food, and on the other side there is no food at all. We saw every day that there were so many people that didn’t have enough food,” de Sanctis told the Thomson Reuters Foundation, explaining that “equo” means “equal” in Italian.Between 30 percent and 40 percent of food produced around the world is never eaten because it is spoiled after harvest and during transportation, or thrown away by shops and consumers.Yet almost 800 million people worldwide go to bed hungry every night, according to U.N. figures.The problem has become so serious that halving world food waste by 2030 was included as a target for global development goals adopted by world leaders in 2015.From Italy to Germany and Brazil to Kenya, a growing number of enterprises are rescuing food that would otherwise go into landfills to feed those in need - a trend some experts say may be the answer to the mountains of food waste created daily.Equoevento has so far distributed 200,000 meals from food collected from some 400 events. Entirely run by volunteers, the organisation may soon need to seek office space as it expands, de Sanctis said.Experts say reducing food waste is not only a moral imperative but a way of curbing emissions of planet-warming gases linked to agriculture which accounts for about 20 percent of overall greenhouse gas emissions.The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has calculated that global food waste would be the world’s third-largest greenhouse gas emitter if it were treated as a country.UGLY VEGThousands of miles away in Kenya, a different kind of initiative is taking root - one that uses produce deemed too ugly for Western supermarket shelves, such as wonky carrots, curved cucumbers and dimpled apples.Nairobi-based enterprise Enviu aims to turn some 5 tonnes of “imperfect” produce into 78,000 school meals a day under a pilot programme it is developing with the World Food Programme’s (WFP) new innovation hub.According to the FAO, about a third of all food, by weight, is spoiled or thrown away worldwide as it moves from where it is produced to where it is eaten, costing up to $940 billion per year globally.“Around 10 percent of the European Union’s fresh fruits and vegetables come from Kenya, and when produce makes it to the airport it gets sorted there for the cosmetic standards,” said Robert Opp, head of innovation at WFP.“An estimated 25 percent of that food, about 75 tonnes a day, is rejected,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.Using rejected food would mean farmers no longer losing income and more children getting fed, he added.“There’s a massive amount of food wasted every year and there’s still hunger, so if we can make the food systems more efficient, reduce the wastage and improve distribution - that’s a good thing for the fight against hunger,” Opp said.OLYMPIC LEFTOVERSAs efforts to cut food waste spread around the globe, athletes at this month’s Rio Olympics will play a part, perhaps without even knowing it.Refetto-Rio, an initiative by two chefs, Italian Massimo Bottura and Brazilian David Hertz, aims to turn excess food from the Olympic Village into meals for the hungry.While initiatives like Equoevento or Refetto-Rio are on a relatively small scale, experts say every little helps.Brian Lipinski, food programme associate at thinktank World Resources Institute (WRI), said piecemeal approaches combined with national policies on food waste were necessary to achieve a meaningful reduction in food waste.“Maybe the impact from one of these non-profits that are picking up some excess food and donating it is small on its own, but it’s really one of the only ways to go about addressing this sort of waste right now,” he said.Lipinski also said it was time to stop focusing on how to produce more food for the world’s growing population and instead concentrate on efforts to reduce food waste.EUROPE TAKES LEADIn Europe, the European Commission has proposed that member states develop national strategies to prevent food waste by at least 30 percent by 2025.Germany has been a leader on the issue. In 2012, the German government launched a “too good for the trash” campaign and the country has also pioneered “food-sharing”, using the internet to distribute produce recovered from store rubbish while still in good condition.In 2015, France introduced legislation banning big supermarkets from destroying unsold but edible food. Failure to comply could expose supermarket managers to two years in jail and fines of 75,000 euros ($83,850).And last week Italy passed a law that makes it easier for supermarkets to donate unsold food to charities, in an effort to reduce waste.“There’s still too little awareness about food around the world,” said de Sanctis while checking his phone to see which of his volunteers had signed up for the next food pick-up.“People don’t plan what to eat and there’s a lot of waste in people’s homes. We have to educate people about food waste because it’s a real problem.”(Reporting by Magdalena Mis; Editing by Katie Nguyen; Please credit Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, that covers humanitarian news, women’s rights, corruption and climate change.

2,BLACK VOICES,South African Politician Proclaims A 'Non-Racial' Era After Vote Wins,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/south-african-politician-proclaims-non-racial-era-after-vote-wins_us_57a8dfaee4b0aae2a5a0c8d7,Mmusi Maimane isn't liked by many ANC members who say he is a puppet of a white elitist movement.,2016-08-08,"Democratic Alliance leader Mmusi Maimane gestures as he speaks to members of the media at the result center in Pretoria, South Africa.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a8e4912a0000fa01fb566a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"South Africa’s main opposition leader proclaimed the dawn of an era of ‘non-racial’ politics envisioned by the late Nelson Mandela on Monday, saying a bid by the African National Congress to highlight divisions at last week’s local elections had backfired.Mmusi Maimane, whose leadership of the Democratic Alliance (DA) since last year has helped overturn its image as a party for wealthy whites, called the vote a historic break with the past that could bring the DA into national government in 2019.The ANC lost its majorities in Johannesburg, the symbolic Nelson Mandela Bay and the municipality that is home to the capital Pretoria, in its biggest ever election losses.The party that has dominated South Africa since the end of apartheid led the overall count, but the result dealt a significant blow to President Jacob Zuma ahead of the next parliamentary vote in three years’ time.The DA is now expected to lead coalition governments in two of these electoral districts and also boosted its majority to more than two thirds in Cape Town, which it has run since 2006, a vote of confidence in its ability to govern.Angry about corruption, unemployment and poor basic services, many ANC supporters turned to the DA - making a switch that was unthinkable only a few years ago.“It’s a incredible moment for our country,” part-time preacher Maimane told Reuters, dressed top-to-toe in the DA’s blue, from his leather jacket to designer shoes.The ANC campaign focused on reminding voters of its role in ending apartheid 22 years ago, and of the DA’s white roots, even comparing the party to the former apartheid regime.Some black voters were also told they would be “black Boers” if they chose the DA, a derogatory reference to Afrikaans-speaking white farmers.DA election posters featured images of 36-year-old Maimane in poor townships around South African cities, symbolizing his role in broadening the appeal of the Alliance, rooted in a white campaign in the 1960s against white minority rule.“HISTORIC”“The most historic thing about this election is people rejected the racial divisions and said its possible for black and white South Africans to work together,” Maimane said.“In 1994, the choice was between freedom or apartheid. The ANC has always sought since then to make the choice about black or white. The ANC misread South Africa.”A Christian who developed his rousing speaking style in the pulpit, Maimane is more popular with businesses than Zuma and is open to engaging with Western governments in a way that has made the ANC uncomfortable due to colonial legacies.Zuma has dismissed Maimane’s threat due to his youth and lack of experience on a continent where age is often considered an important factor in choosing a leader.“The assessment for any leader in any political environment is the scoreboard,” Maimane said, adding that Zuma should consider following Britain’s David Cameron in standing down following a defeat at the ballot box.Maimane’s age, charisma and speaking style - punctured with dramatic pauses and deliberate hand gestures - have drawn comparisons with U.S. President Barack Obama.“You could have worse tags,” Maimane said, smiling.“The Obama project was about hope, about change, and there is something about my project that could be ascribed to that.”Maimane, who has a white South African wife, came under personal attacks during campaigning from ANC members who say he is a puppet of a white elitist movement.One insult included calling Maimane a ‘coconut’, implying he is black on the outside but white on the inside.“I had to endure a barrage of racial insults. What you’ve got to do is to steel your back and carry on,” Maimane said.“I recognize that they wanted to do everything in their power to win, to a point when you recognize it’s a tactical thing to divide the nation along racial lines.”NATIONAL ELECTIONSMaimane said he believes it is now possible to bring the ANC’s share of the vote in national elections in 2019 below 50 percent, opening up the chance of the DA ruling in a coalition.With solid support in rural areas, the ANC still has majority support across the country, a reflection of its liberation struggle history and the significant improvement in basic living standards for poor South Africans since apartheid.The ANC won 62 percent of the vote in 2014 national elections but only 53 percent in the local vote last week.If the DA is to govern nationally it will need to drastically reduce inequality and convince poor black South Africans that it represents all races.Black people make up 80 percent of the 54 million population yet, two decades after apartheid, most of the economy in terms of ownership of land and companies remains in the hands of white people, who account for 8 percent of the population.Maimane has promised voters the DA will provide jobs, better services and eradicate corruption in the cities it runs.“Momentum building going toward 2019 is about good governance. It’s about proving to the public that we can govern nationally one day,” Maimane said.“Where we’ve governed, we’ve grown everywhere. Where the ANC has governed, they’ve gone down.”The DA will now go into a difficult negotiating period over coalitions, possibly having to link up with the radical leftist Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), whose firebrand leader Julius Malema wants to nationalize mines and take land from whites.“The initial phases have started,” Maimane said of coalition talks, adding that local governments were about delivering services and not national policy shifts.“It doesn’t mean I endorse the EFF’s view on white South Africans or that I endorse their philosophy on nationalization.”(Editing by Philippa Fletcher) "

No charges were filed in the case, but Lee Remington Williams, a professor at Bellarmine University in Louisville, sent a seven-page letter this week to the city’s police chief asking him to reopen the investigation of the 34-year-old’s death.Alicia Smiley, a police spokeswoman, said Chief Steve Conrad would review the request and give it “full consideration.”Jones was the first African-American woman to pass the Kentucky bar exam, and represented Ali, then known as Cassius Clay, in securing the eventual boxing champ’s first professional contract.The Louisville Courier-Journal reported that she helped integrate the University of Louisville.Eight years ago, the Federal Bureau of Investigation matched a fingerprint found inside Jones’s car to a man who was 17 at the time of the murder. Then-Commonwealth’s Attorney Dave Stengel concluded two years later that he could not prosecute the case, citing loss of evidence and the death of key witnesses, the newspaper reported.Williams, a lawyer who teaches pre-law at Bellarmine, initially wanted to write a book about the case, but now is focused on helping to get the case reopened, noting that the lead detective and the then-teenager are still alive.Jefferson County Attorney Mike O’Connell said on Thursday that his office has a personal interest in the case, citing the presence of a plaque commemorating the young attorney’s service to the community. Jones’s niece also has been a long-time staff member, he said.“She was so far ahead of her time,” said O’Connell, who added that it was up to the police to decide whether or not to reopen the investigation.Jones was not a county attorney at the time, but the position she held was absorbed into the county attorney’s office several years ago, according to the county attorney’s office.(Reporting by Steve Bittenbender, Editing by Ben Klayman)"
4,POLITICS,Donald Trump Is Provoking The Latino Community. Will It Answer In November?,Laura Barrón-López,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-latinos-clinton_us_57a60533e4b03ba680128744,"“We need to show everyone in this country that once and for all, this is not how we’re going to be treated.""",2016-08-07,"Latinos protest Trump outside the Republican presidential debate in Simi Valley, California, Sept. 16, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a60ad41300002a007c359c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― In 2006, there were the May Day marches. In 2010, the Dream Act failed. In 2012, the president implemented deferred action for undocumented childhood arrivals. In 2013, the Senate passed immigration reform legislation. That legislation went nowhere ― so in 2014, the president announced deferred action for undocumented parents of Americans.In 2016, the Supreme Court stalled the president’s executive actions on immigration.Latinos had high hopes for the last 10 years, but have been left with no substantive policy wins for their community and are witnessing an election cycle that began with a candidate for the Republican nomination calling Mexicans “criminals” and “rapists.”In July, Republicans formally nominated that candidate for the presidency of the United States.“Right now these forces are knocking on our door and they’re knocking on our door saying ‘we are not afraid of you’ ― it’s kind of like a teasing,” said Maria Teresa Kumar, head of Voto Latino, a nonprofit focused on mobilizing Latinos.Donald Trump is the one knocking, and with him comes the promise of a border wall, a reversal of all of President Barack Obama’s executive actions, mass deportations and a leader who incites racist vitriol toward Latinos ― those born in the U.S., those immigrating and those who are undocumented.For Latinos at the Democratic National Convention, one thing was clear: This is a moment unlike any before in American politics. A moment to prove to those running for the presidency ― and other levels of office ― that they won’t win unless they prioritize the Latino voter. They have the power: 27.3 million Latinos are estimated to be eligible to vote on election day. But it remains to be seen whether they’ll use it. Out of those eligible voters, nearly half will be millennials, a notoriously difficult group to get to the polls. But if primaries like Nevada’s are any indication, where a record number registered to vote this year, Latinos are priming themselves for this moment.“Most people don’t realize that Latinos from now on will make the difference in who the president is,” Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.) said at a Poder PAC event during the DNC honoring Latinas in politics. “We will choose. Most people don’t know that in a lot of these statewide races, we will choose.”That’s what Amanda Renteria, national political director for Hillary Clinton’s campaign, is betting on. Speaking at the same fundraiser event in downtown Philadelphia, Renteria, a daughter of farm workers in California’s Central Valley, told the influential Latinos in attendance that the stakes couldn’t be higher.“The world has actually seen Donald Trump disrespect and devalue us,” she said to cheers from the small crowd. “We need to show everyone in this country that once and for all, this is not how we’re going to be treated. So I need everyone in this room, we need to do everything we can to not just defeat Donald Trump in November but to absolutely overwhelmingly reject him.”Later, in an interview with The Huffington Post, Renteria recalled past battles like the mass marches calling for immigrant rights, and the failed attempts by Congress to pass immigration reform, admitting that Latinos have learned some hard lessons along the way.But there’s no doubt in her mind that this time is different.“We’ve never had someone that has disrespected the community as much as Donald Trump has,” she said. “Not just immigrants but first, second, third, fourth generations. That really has united the Latino community in a way, that even if you are born here, you know he looks at your kids a little differently.” It’s not enough to be anti-Trump, however ― people have to actively be pro-Clinton. Some immigrant rights activists are holding out for deeper commitments and remain wary of the former secretary of state.Renteria acknowledged this. Clinton will move on immigration reform in her “first 100 days,” Renteria said, repeating the Democratic nominee’s frequent pledge. “This is real.” And her campaign won’t rely on Trump’s failures alone. It’s also about proving to Latino voters that the Democratic nominee is on their side. She has vowed to alleviate naturalization costs, close immigration detention centers run by private prisons and add to Obama’s DACA and DAPA actions. Having run an unsuccessful bid for Congress herself, Renteria knows that getting communities of color involved is “much harder than a good commercial” highlighting the opponent’s awful rhetoric. Voters need to make a deep connection with the candidate.“I don’t want to underestimate the importance of proving to Republicans that if you have a candidate like Trump we will turn out against you,” Renteria said. “That pushes Republicans to say, ‘If I am not a part of what Latinos need ― whether it’s comprehensive immigration reform, or education or the economy ― if we ignore this community, we lose time and time again.’”That will trickle down the ballot, she added. Not only this year, but for years to come on the local, state and national election map.“This is literally he does not want you if you have any Mexican heritage whatever generation you are,” continued Renteria, who is of Mexican descent herself. “And she wants to give you a voice in the White House.” “My parents and so many parents came here for a better life, and to think that [Trump] will get elected and that notion no longer exists, it’s a big deal,” Renteria added.The disparity between what Republicans and Democrats are offering for Latinos was on full display during the conventions. Hector E. Sanchez saw it.Sanchez attended both conventions in his capacity as chair of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, a coalition representing the nation’s leading Hispanic organizations. It’s a nonpartisan network focused on policy and doesn’t endorse anyone for the presidency. (Sanchez is also the executive director of the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO.)At the RNC, he recalled, “It’s unbelievable, they had the most anti-immigrant voices in the nation... some people from the KKK, and the general messaging was anti-immigrant, anti-welcome, anti-integration, anti-everything of values we should have as a nation.”At the DNC, by contrast, he was relieved to see immigrants and Latinos given a platform on the convention stage. He noted the importance of the symbolism behind speeches like one given by Karla Ortiz, a U.S. citizen who fears that her undocumented parents will be deported.“We are under such horrible attack that it is affecting the quality of life of families,” Sanchez said. “Hate crimes against Latinos are increasing; racial profiling against Latinos is increasing.”That’s why, he added, if Clinton is elected, his organization will push for solid representation of Latinos in her cabinet ― he wants four ― and for her to demonstrate a serious commitment to immigration reform.And if Clinton doesn’t deliver? That’s not possible, said Catherine Pino, co-founder of the Poder PAC.“She can’t do that, you know why?” Pino asked. “If she wants to run again and be elected in four years, it won’t work. She knows.”Pino has supported Clinton since 2008. When she lost, Pino was depressed. Drinking a margarita with close friends as they watched Clinton concede to Obama, Pino realized something needed to change. That’s when the Poder PAC was formed. Up until 2015, its mission was to fund Latinas running for all levels of elected office. Now, they’ve tailored their approach to focus on Latinas running for Congress.If Latinos want their voices heard and their expectations met, Pino knows it’s not enough for Clinton to win the presidency. And since the Democratic establishment had a history of ignoring Latino candidates, Pino wanted to fill that gap.“It’s been one of our frustrations,” Pino said. “We’re in D.C., we have a government relations firm and do a lot of work with [the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee], and we’ve taken them to task about supporting our candidates.”Sayu Bhojwani is trying to fill the void as well. Bhojwani, the former New York City commissioner of immigrant affairs, kicked off an effort during the DNC to have what she calls new American caucuses established in legislatures nationwide.Bhojwani, who heads the New American Leader Project along with a team of immigrant and first-generation elected officials, immigrated to the U.S about 30 years ago from Belize and is of Indian descent. One in five Americans are immigrants or children of immigrants. So the key to passing immigration reform, Bhojwani said, lies in getting first-generation Americans and newly naturalized citizens into office.“There’s a big gap between us being asked to tell our stories and us being told, ‘This is what we commit to doing in order to make immigration reform happen,’” Bhojwani said.While she knows the immigrant community’s animosity toward Trump runs deep, she doesn’t think it’s enough to create a true movement. Down-ballot races need to be a part of the strategy, she said.“It can only be a political moment if we can show that we can flex our political muscles beyond the top of the ticket,” she said. “Otherwise we become heavily reliant on one person, who, because of the way American democracy works, is only one arm of our government. The fact that we keep making that mistake every election cycle, it just blows my mind.”"

Hector E. Sanchez saw it.Sanchez attended both conventions in his capacity as chair of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, a coalition representing the nation’s leading Hispanic organizations. It’s a nonpartisan network focused on policy and doesn’t endorse anyone for the presidency. (Sanchez is also the executive director of the Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, an affiliate of the AFL-CIO.)At the RNC, he recalled, “It’s unbelievable, they had the most anti-immigrant voices in the nation... some people from the KKK, and the general messaging was anti-immigrant, anti-welcome, anti-integration, anti-everything of values we should have as a nation.”At the DNC, by contrast, he was relieved to see immigrants and Latinos given a platform on the convention stage. He noted the importance of the symbolism behind speeches like one given by Karla Ortiz, a U.S. citizen who fears that her undocumented parents will be deported.“We are under such horrible attack that it is affecting the quality of life of families,” Sanchez said. “Hate crimes against Latinos are increasing; racial profiling against Latinos is increasing.”That’s why, he added, if Clinton is elected, his organization will push for solid representation of Latinos in her cabinet ― he wants four ― and for her to demonstrate a serious commitment to immigration reform.And if Clinton doesn’t deliver? That’s not possible, said Catherine Pino, co-founder of the Poder PAC.“She can’t do that, you know why?” Pino asked. “If she wants to run again and be elected in four years, it won’t work. She knows.”Pino has supported Clinton since 2008. When she lost, Pino was depressed. Drinking a margarita with close friends as they watched Clinton concede to Obama, Pino realized something needed to change. That’s when the Poder PAC was formed. Up until 2015, its mission was to fund Latinas running for all levels of elected office. Now, they’ve tailored their approach to focus on Latinas running for Congress.If Latinos want their voices heard and their expectations met, Pino knows it’s not enough for Clinton to win the presidency. And since the Democratic establishment had a history of ignoring Latino candidates, Pino wanted to fill that gap.“It’s been one of our frustrations,” Pino said. “We’re in D.C., we have a government relations firm and do a lot of work with [the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee], and we’ve taken them to task about supporting our candidates.”Sayu Bhojwani is trying to fill the void as well. Bhojwani, the former New York City commissioner of immigrant affairs, kicked off an effort during the DNC to have what she calls new American caucuses established in legislatures nationwide.Bhojwani, who heads the New American Leader Project along with a team of immigrant and first-generation elected officials, immigrated to the U.S about 30 years ago from Belize and is of Indian descent. One in five Americans are immigrants or children of immigrants. So the key to passing immigration reform, Bhojwani said, lies in getting first-generation Americans and newly naturalized citizens into office.“There’s a big gap between us being asked to tell our stories and us being told, ‘This is what we commit to doing in order to make immigration reform happen,’” Bhojwani said.While she knows the immigrant community’s animosity toward Trump runs deep, she doesn’t think it’s enough to create a true movement. Down-ballot races need to be a part of the strategy, she said.“It can only be a political moment if we can show that we can flex our political muscles beyond the top of the ticket,” she said. “Otherwise we become heavily reliant on one person, who, because of the way American democracy works, is only one arm of our government. The fact that we keep making that mistake every election cycle, it just blows my mind.”"

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) on Sunday said that Donald Trump risks losing Arizona, a longstanding Republican stronghold, over his inflammatory comments about immigrants and immigration.When asked whether Hillary Clinton could win there, Flake responded, “Bill Clinton won Arizona. So yes, it’s possible.”No Democrat has won the state in the 20 years since Bill Clinton’s victory in 1996. Mitt Romney won Arizona by 9 points in 2012. “The statements he made out of the gate about those crossing the border being rapists and whatnot ― that doesn’t sit well,” Flake said on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” referring to Trump. “And then to refer to a judge born in Indiana as a Mexican in a pejorative way ― you can’t expect to win Arizona when you make statements like that, and you offend a large and growing demographic needlessly.”Flake also said that Trump should apologize to the family of Humayun Khan, an American soldier who was killed in 2004 during the Iraq War. Trump belittled the family after they gave a speech at the Democratic National Convention opposing his candidacy. Trump suggested that Khan’s mother, Ghazala, was not “allowed” to speak at the convention because of her religion. Ghazala Khan and her husband, Khizr, fired back afterward.Flake has refused to endorse Trump for months over his anti-immigrant comments, but stopped short of saying he could never endorse the billionaire. On Sunday, he maintained this mantra, saying Trump could still win his support if he changed his policy platform and his “tone and tenor.”Polls suggest that Flake is right about Trump’s vulnerability in Arizona. Several recent polls have Clinton close to Trump in the state, and some even show her ahead. HuffPost Pollster’s average of recent polling data shows Trump ahead by just one-tenth of a point ― 44.4 percent to 44.3 percent.A Clinton victory in Arizona would signal a landslide for Democrats. Trump has to flip several states that Barack Obama won in 2012 to secure the presidency.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S. CORRECTION: This article previously stated that Trump needs to flip several states to secure a nomination, rather than the presidency itself."

But he returned to Iran in 2010 and received a hero’s welcome before being arrested.A U.S. official said in 2010 that Washington had received “useful information” from Amiri.Iran had accused the CIA of kidnapping Amiri. U.S. officials said Amiri had been free to come and go as he pleased, and that he may have returned because of pressures on his family in Iran.Amiri had denied this, saying “my family had no problems.” In a video aired by Iranian state TV in 2010, Amiri said he had fled from U.S. agents.Iran, the United States and five other world powers reached a landmark deal last year, under which Iran agreed to limit its nuclear program in such a way as to ensure it cannot develop nuclear weapons in exchange for a lifting of economic sanctions."

The heavy fighting and air strikes reported from the area seemed to indicate any passage that may have been opened would be far from secure enough for civilians to travel through.Rebels have been trying to break through a thin strip of government-controlled territory to reconnect insurgent areas in western Syria with their encircled sector of eastern Aleppo, in effect breaking a government siege begun last month.The offensive against the government’s Ramousah military complex, which contains a number of military colleges, began on Friday. Taking control of Ramousah and linking up with eastern Aleppo would isolate government-held western Aleppo by cutting the southern route out toward the capital Damascus.It would also give rebels access to armaments stored in the base the Syrian army has used in the five-year conflict as a strategic platform from which to shell opposition targets.Two rebel groups and a monitor said on Saturday they had broken the siege, but pro-government media outlets denied the claim and said the Syrian army was in fact regaining recently taken territory from rebels.“We’ve seen reports but the situation is fluid and we aren’t going to provide battlefield updates,” the State Department official told Reuters.Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, formerly the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, said in an online statement: “Fighters from outside the city met their brother fighters from inside the city, and work is under way to establish control over remaining positions to break the siege.”A commander from more moderate rebel group also told Reuters the siege had been broken but said it was early days and matters were “not easy.”The United Kingdom-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war, said intense fighting and heavy air strikes meant no secure corridor had yet been established between the two rebel-held territories. WORST MONTH FOR HOSPITAL ATTACKSIn another report, the Observatory said an air strike near a hospital in northwestern Syria on Saturday killed 10 people including children and damaged the hospital. July was the worst month yet for attacks on medical facilities in the war-torn country, a medical charity said, with 43 recorded attacks on healthcare facilities in Syria.The hospital is in Meles, about 15 km (9 miles) from Idlib city in rebel-held Idlib province. Syrian government and allied Russian warplanes operate in Syria but it was not known which aircraft carried out the strike.The Observatory, in its report on the Aleppo fighting, said rebels had taken control of the Weaponry College, the main Artillery College, the Air Force Technical College and the Ramousah Garage area. Government forces still control the cement factory and some military housing.“This is the biggest military and symbolic loss sustained by the regime, the Russians, the Iranians and Lebanon’s Hezbollah since the start of 2013,” the Observatory said, adding that heavy air strikes, thought to be from Russian planes, hit Aleppo on Saturday.The Syrian military news agency said later on Saturday the Syrian army had restored control over the Artillery College and had made the rebels withdraw from the Weaponry College.A witness said people in the streets of a part of eastern Aleppo briefly celebrated reports of the siege being broken before the sight of warplanes in the sky scattered them.A live Syrian state TV report from the outskirts of the artillery base in Ramousah, in southwestAleppo, broadcast the sound of gunfire, explosions and warplanes flying over.Videos released by rebel groups claim to show gun battles as insurgents moved into buildings in the complex.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad wants to take full control of Aleppo, pre-war Syria’s most populous city, which has been divided between rebel and government-held areas. Such a victory would be a crushing blow to the insurgents.CIVILIAN SUFFERINGA quarter of a million civilians are thought to still live in Aleppo’s opposition-controlled eastern neighborhoods, effectively under siege since the army and allied militia cut off the last road into rebel districts in early July.Residents on both side of the city are suffering. Government areas frequently come under attack from rebel shelling, and rebel-held areas are routinely shelled and come under air attack from Syrian and allied Russian forces.Humanitarian groups say the situation in eastern Aleppo is very worrying.

16,THE WORLDPOST,Syrian Rebels Claim To Break Assad's Siege Of Aleppo,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aleppo-siege-broken-syria_us_57a7433ce4b021fd9878e179,Pro-government media outlets denied the claim as intense fighting continues.,2016-08-07,"People carry a Free Syrian Army flag and a Jabhat Fatah al-Sham flag as they celebrate the news of the breaking of the siege of rebel-held areas of Aleppo, Syria August 6, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a743a72a00002d004f8cf0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BEIRUT, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Syrian rebels broke through to besieged opposition-held areas in eastern Aleppo on Saturday in an assault on a major government military complex meant to end a month-long siege, insurgents and a monitoring group said.Pro-government media outlets denied the siege had been broken and a U.S. State Department official said the situation was “too fluid” to comment. The heavy fighting and air strikes reported from the area seemed to indicate any passage that may have been opened would be far from secure enough for civilians to travel through.Rebels have been trying to break through a thin strip of government-controlled territory to reconnect insurgent areas in western Syria with their encircled sector of eastern Aleppo, in effect breaking a government siege begun last month.The offensive against the government’s Ramousah military complex, which contains a number of military colleges, began on Friday. Taking control of Ramousah and linking up with eastern Aleppo would isolate government-held western Aleppo by cutting the southern route out toward the capital Damascus.It would also give rebels access to armaments stored in the base the Syrian army has used in the five-year conflict as a strategic platform from which to shell opposition targets.Two rebel groups and a monitor said on Saturday they had broken the siege, but pro-government media outlets denied the claim and said the Syrian army was in fact regaining recently taken territory from rebels.“We’ve seen reports but the situation is fluid and we aren’t going to provide battlefield updates,” the State Department official told Reuters.Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, formerly the al Qaeda-affiliated Nusra Front, said in an online statement: “Fighters from outside the city met their brother fighters from inside the city, and work is under way to establish control over remaining positions to break the siege.”A commander from more moderate rebel group also told Reuters the siege had been broken but said it was early days and matters were “not easy.”The United Kingdom-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the war, said intense fighting and heavy air strikes meant no secure corridor had yet been established between the two rebel-held territories. WORST MONTH FOR HOSPITAL ATTACKSIn another report, the Observatory said an air strike near a hospital in northwestern Syria on Saturday killed 10 people including children and damaged the hospital. July was the worst month yet for attacks on medical facilities in the war-torn country, a medical charity said, with 43 recorded attacks on healthcare facilities in Syria.The hospital is in Meles, about 15 km (9 miles) from Idlib city in rebel-held Idlib province. Syrian government and allied Russian warplanes operate in Syria but it was not known which aircraft carried out the strike.The Observatory, in its report on the Aleppo fighting, said rebels had taken control of the Weaponry College, the main Artillery College, the Air Force Technical College and the Ramousah Garage area. Government forces still control the cement factory and some military housing.“This is the biggest military and symbolic loss sustained by the regime, the Russians, the Iranians and Lebanon’s Hezbollah since the start of 2013,” the Observatory said, adding that heavy air strikes, thought to be from Russian planes, hit Aleppo on Saturday.The Syrian military news agency said later on Saturday the Syrian army had restored control over the Artillery College and had made the rebels withdraw from the Weaponry College.A witness said people in the streets of a part of eastern Aleppo briefly celebrated reports of the siege being broken before the sight of warplanes in the sky scattered them.A live Syrian state TV report from the outskirts of the artillery base in Ramousah, in southwestAleppo, broadcast the sound of gunfire, explosions and warplanes flying over.Videos released by rebel groups claim to show gun battles as insurgents moved into buildings in the complex.Syrian President Bashar al-Assad wants to take full control of Aleppo, pre-war Syria’s most populous city, which has been divided between rebel and government-held areas. Such a victory would be a crushing blow to the insurgents.CIVILIAN SUFFERINGA quarter of a million civilians are thought to still live in Aleppo’s opposition-controlled eastern neighborhoods, effectively under siege since the army and allied militia cut off the last road into rebel districts in early July.Residents on both side of the city are suffering. Government areas frequently come under attack from rebel shelling, and rebel-held areas are routinely shelled and come under air attack from Syrian and allied Russian forces.Humanitarian groups say the situation in eastern Aleppo is very worrying. The Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS) charity group said that already depleted medical facilities were targeted by strikes 15 times in July.Only 35 doctors remain in the city and over 100 people are in need of medical evacuation, SAMSAleppo Coordinator Dr Abo El-Ezz said in a statement.The multi-sided civil war in Syria, which has been raging since 2011, has drawn in regional and global powers, caused the world’s worst humanitarian emergency and attracted recruits to Islamist militancy from around the world.Some rebel groups refer to the Aleppo battle as the “Ibrahim al-Youssef Offensive,” a reference to a Sunni army officer said to have led a massacre of cadets at the Artillery College in the late 1970s.

The International Paralympic Committee on Sunday announced Russia’s suspension due to a widespread doping scandal. The IPC board’s decision was unanimous. “This decision has placed a huge burden upon all our shoulders, but it’s a decision we’ve had to take in the best interests of the Paralympic Movement,” IPC President Sir Philip Craven said in a statement. The ban was anticipated before the announcement as part of the fallout from Team Russia’s massive Olympic doping scandal. A World Anti-Doping Agency panel last November released an explosive report that accused the Russian government of helping its athletes cheat doping tests. The WADA later hired Toronto lawyer Richard McLaren to conduct an independent investigation into Russia’s program; the so-called McLaren Report, released in July, concluded that Russia’s ministry of sports helped manipulate doping tests so that drug-enhanced athletes would be sure to pass them. Russia’s Paralympic athletes have historically been among the top contenders in the world games. During the 2012 Paralympic Games in London, Russia ranked second overall in the gold medal count, placing only behind China. Russia has three weeks to appeal the IPC’s decision. If the ban is upheld, it will mark the first time an entire country’s delegation has been barred from the games, according to The Wall Street Journal.Other Russian athletes competing in Rio narrowly managed to escape the fate now facing their Paralympic counterparts. Just weeks before the start of the Olympic Games, the International Olympic Committee announced there would be no blanket ban on Russia’s athletes. Athletes were tested on an individual basis and 271 of 387 were ultimately cleared to participate in the games. “Ultimately, as the global governing body for the Paralympic Movement, it is our responsibility to ensure fair competition, so that athletes can have confidence that they are competing on a level playing field,” Crave said. “This is vital to the integrity and credibility of Paralympic sport, and in order to achieve this it is fundamental that each member abides by the rules.”The Rio Paralympics, in which athletes with disabilities compete in sports that include wheelchair fencing, swimming and taekwondo, start Sept. 7."

Now, a neuroimaging study from the University of",2016-08-07,<em>Comparison of grey matter (brown) and white matter (yellow) in gender-matched subjects.</em>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a68faa13000013007c362e.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Scientists have long suspected that being overweight affects the brain. Now, a neuroimaging study from the University of Cambridge provides dramatic new evidence of how great the effects can be (Ronan et al., 2016).The study, published in the journal Neurobiology of Aging, compared a group of people with a normal Body Mass Index (BMI) of 19.5 to an overweight and obese group with a BMI averaging 43.4. It found that “cerebral white matter volume in overweight and obese individuals was associated with a greater degree of atrophy, with maximal effects in middle-age.”The biggest changes were seen in the brain’s white matter, the tissue responsible for communicating information between regions of the brain. White matter makes up around half the volume of the brain, and it connects various regions of gray matter to coordinate their functions. It joins all four of the brain’s lobes (frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital) with each other, and with the emotional brain or limbic system in the center.The researchers looked at the brains of 527 people aged 20 to 87. They found few differences in the brains of younger people. By age 50, however, the effects of obesity in the brain were dramatic, with the brain of an obese 50 year old, for instance, looking like the brain of a lean 60 year old. Other studies have shown that obesity is associated with other diseases like diabetes, cancer, and heart disease. An examination of the lifespan differences found that obesity cuts 8 years off your lifespan. But when the effects of obesity-related diseases are factored in, the difference rises to 30 years (Grover et al., 2015).One of the brain study’s investigators, Professor Sadaf Farooqi of the Institute of Metabolic Science at Cambridge, says: “We don’t yet know the implications of these changes in brain structure. Clearly, this must be a starting point for us to explore in more depth the effects of weight, diet and exercise on the brain and memory.”This raises the intriguing question of whether weight loss can reverse the brain atrophy found in overweight people. One of the study’s authors, professor Paul Fletcher of the Department of Psychiatry wonders “whether these changes could be reversible with weight loss, which may well be the case.”While long term weight loss is elusive, with research showing that most dieters regain even more weight than they lost, there are several new studies demonstrating that it is possible. When emotional eating is successfully treated, not only do dieters maintain their new weight, they continue losing weight over time.A study at Bond University found that using EFT or Emotional Freedom Techniques, a common treatment for psychological trauma, dieters lost an additional 11.1 lb over the course of the subsequent year (Stapleton, Sheldon et al., 2012; Stapleton, Bannatyne et al., 2016). Lead researcher, psychology professor Dr. Peta Stapleton, is now using neuroimaging to study the brains of these successful losers. This will provide clues as to whether the atrophy noted in the Cambridge study is reversible.ReferencesRonan, L., Alexander-Bloch, A. F., Wagstyl, K., Farooqi, S., Brayne, C., Tyler, L.

In 2004",2016-08-07,Obesity Is Associated With 8 to 20 Years Shorter Life Span,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a751432a00001500fb52c0.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Despite a national initiative to reduce obesity, the percentage of obese Americans has risen in the past ten years. In 2004, 32 percent of adults were obese, while in 2014, the figure had risen to 38 percent.Dr. Marion Nesle, a professor in the public health department of New York University, called the numbers, “very unfortunate and very disappointing.” The figures originate from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which is released every two years (Ogden et al., 2014).In a previous report I wrote for the Huffington Post, I called obesity “the new smoking” for its effect on health and longevity. The large-scale study I reported on in that article found that obesity trimmed 8 years off the life span of the average person ― but when obesity-related diseases such as diabetes and heart disease were factored in, the figure rose to 20 years (Grover et al., 2014).The latest report on obesity confounded experts, many of whom expected the obesity numbers to fall. The consumption of sugary sodas has declined by a quarter since 1999, and calorie intake has dropped for both adults and children. At the same time, the American diet has improved in quality, with lower consumption of trans fats and increased intake of fiber, according to another study recently published in the journal Heath Affairs (Wang, 2015).However, Dr. Walter Willet, chair of the nutrition department at the Harvard School of Public Health, one author of that study, said that the overall numbers mask large disparities. Most of the improvements are found in well-educated Americans, with a big gap between rich and poor.Forty percent of people aged 40-59 were obese, compared to just 17 percent of those aged 2-19. The number of obese youngsters has dropped significantly over the past decade, and experts believe that public health campaigns to raise nutritional awareness may be responsible for the improvements. About 57 percent of black women are obese, the highest rate of any group. At 12 percent, obesity was lowest among Asians, with other demographic groups falling somewhere in between.A variety of experts have called for public policy initiatives to expand the gains made by a few demographic groups to a wider population (Tavernise, 2015).There are several studies analyzing the behaviors of people who lose weight and keep it off permanently, and I summarize these in my book EFT for Weight Loss (Church, 2013). While most dieters regain the weight they’ve lost within two years, a small minority does not. Analysis of their behaviors show that they have common patterns, all of which can be taught. Studies by Dr. Peta Stapleton at Bond University show that dieters who use these techniques don’t gain the weight back (Stapleton, Sheldon, & Porter, 2012; Stapleton et al., 2016). A public education campaign to share evidence-based techniques could result in better outcomes, according to the authorities cited in the recent reports.ReferencesChurch, D. (2013).

Together, they present the choices that seem available to Asian Americans: to be white or to be black. The alternative is to be a perpetual foreigner. Reeves was born in Beirut when it was a resort destination. His biological father was predominantly Hawaiian Chinese; his mother, English. The leading man reportedly is estranged from his father, having been raised by his mother in Canada. His given name is inspired by a Hawaiian term for wind over the mountains.As one of his characters might proclaim, “Whoa.”He is not only white, he is archetypal. His big break came in the Bill and Ted adventure films. He was a stoner, with a blank look that enabled the audience to project onto him whatever interior life the respective viewer preferred he have. He was a Valley Guy, a representative of a place, suburban Southern California, as well as an era, the 1980s, and a generation, for whom his demeanor is ideal.In later flicks, such as Speed and The Matrix, he remained a prototype. If anything, ironically he was inscrutable (as Asians are reputed to be). Surface was substance. In Point Break, a Zen surfing heist thriller with a deserved cult following, he portrayed a former football star turned law enforcement officer, called “Johnny Utah,” a moniker that signifies arch-assimilation (maybe it could be outdone by “Johnny Kansas”). In Street Kings, a first-class “B” movie, he is a conflicted cop who in the opening scenes busts Asian criminals, replete with ethnic epithets.Woods was cast as a reluctant spokesperson for the mixed race movement. Transforming golf literally single-handedly as when he bounced a ball off his club repeatedly and nonchalantly, he joined Oprah Winfrey to discuss his parents: a father who was a black American Army Green Beret, who boasted white and Native ancestry; a mother who was Thai albeit similarly diverse. Woods called himself “Cablinasian,” a portmanteau term he invented for himself. His given name of “Tiger” honored a Vietnamese soldier who had saved his father’s life. His greatness set off a surreal dispute among Asians and African Americans. They each wished to own him, as if they were picking teams. Blacks approved of Woods, with his father, recalling the segregated courses of his youth, respecting his forebears in the sport, subtly calling out racial discrimination that had prevented them from receiving due awards. They lamented the tendency of some upwardly mobile African Americans to disassociate themselves from the community from whence they had come. Asians asserted that mathematically he was Asian to a greater degree than anything else, he believed in Buddhism, and he had spoken about feeling Asian.The matter was resolved when an older competitor made clear that Woods, for all the talk of being mixed and the Thai maternal line, was indelibly, not positively, black. Fuzzy Zoeller, asked for his opinion of the young phenom, made a casual remark. The winner of the Masters tournament is allowed, in one of those rituals of the game, to select the menu for the group dinner of the players. As the field was being vanquished by Woods, Zoeller told a camera crew trailing behind him that they should tell the boy not to serve fried chicken and collard greens “or whatever the hell it is they serve.” (It would have been equally inapt if he had said, “curry chicken and lemongrass soup,” but the actual quip was a dismissive stereotype of “black” food.)The general response to these examples is, “Yes, of course, because that is how those individuals look.” What is interesting about this reaction is that it reveals our perceptions of race are about appearance. They are not affected by data. A person who is told that Reeves or Woods is part Asian might say, “Oh, yes, around the eyes,” but their general impression is not altered. We are beholden to what we see. There is hardly ambiguity.Even that most quintessential Asian, Bruce Lee, was in that quaint phrase, “Eurasian.” His public persona was exotic. Yet his actual heritage was common enough where he grew up.When the terms “Oriental” and the less polite “Chinaman” were still in common use, Lee achieved fame that was unprecedented and global. Despite having been passed over for the Kung Fu television series, a role that went to a Caucasian who was accomplished as a dancer, the martial arts expert went on to star in his own stories on the big screen, establishing himself as masculine, powerful, and virile.He also was at least one-quarter European in lineage. He was a member of a prominent house in Hong Kong. His genealogy led to controversy within the then-closed society of Eastern fighting schools. He insisted, to the further indignation of his peers, on training people of all origins, boasting a star student who was African American. As a consequence, he was challenged to prove his right to continue practicing his trade. The battle with Wong Jack Man in Oakland has become myth.His death at an early age of a brain hemorrhage, as he was developing what would have been the first big-budget Hollywood martial arts picture, was attributed by conspiracy theorists to a curse for sharing kung fu secrets with outsiders. He has become all the more a legend since then. His appeal is universal. His counsel was, “Be like water, my friend.”All but forgotten is that he was a native-born American, coming into the world in that most Chinese of cities, San Francisco, California. Thanks to the Supreme Court case affirming birthright citizenship, brought by one Wong Kim Ark of the same hometown, son of immigrants who could not naturalize due to a racial bar, Lee, like others who can claim roots on this soil, was legally an equal.Asian Americans have sought to appropriate the term “hapa” to cover these persons. A Hawaiian word, it originally was derogatory. It has been taken over as celebratory.There are many examples, beyond Asians and Asian Americans, of public race and private identity being mismatched. The phenomenon harkens back to the “one drop” rule reflecting a philosophy that any “black” blood taints the purity of whiteness. “Passing” has been practiced likely from the first encounter of populations with differing statuses correlated to color.Salma Hayek, for example, is internationally admired as a Mexican movie star. She is as Mexican as could be. Yet she has become an American citizen. In terms of ancestry, she is only half what she is regarded as; her father is Lebanese. For that matter, Frida Kahlo, whom Hayek portrayed in a hit biopic, is revered as a Mexican painter and feminist heroine. Yet Kahlo was like Hayek. her father was German, and, in the narrative Kahlo herself promoted, Jewish — though later investigation has suggested he was German but not Jewish.The point is that racial categories are social constructs. They correlate only approximately to their supposed biological basis. And racial blending is neither new nor rare. The possibility is what makes us all human."

Blacks approved of Woods, with his father, recalling the segregated courses of his youth, respecting his forebears in the sport, subtly calling out racial discrimination that had prevented them from receiving due awards. They lamented the tendency of some upwardly mobile African Americans to disassociate themselves from the community from whence they had come. Asians asserted that mathematically he was Asian to a greater degree than anything else, he believed in Buddhism, and he had spoken about feeling Asian.The matter was resolved when an older competitor made clear that Woods, for all the talk of being mixed and the Thai maternal line, was indelibly, not positively, black. Fuzzy Zoeller, asked for his opinion of the young phenom, made a casual remark. The winner of the Masters tournament is allowed, in one of those rituals of the game, to select the menu for the group dinner of the players. As the field was being vanquished by Woods, Zoeller told a camera crew trailing behind him that they should tell the boy not to serve fried chicken and collard greens “or whatever the hell it is they serve.” (It would have been equally inapt if he had said, “curry chicken and lemongrass soup,” but the actual quip was a dismissive stereotype of “black” food.)The general response to these examples is, “Yes, of course, because that is how those individuals look.” What is interesting about this reaction is that it reveals our perceptions of race are about appearance. They are not affected by data. A person who is told that Reeves or Woods is part Asian might say, “Oh, yes, around the eyes,” but their general impression is not altered. We are beholden to what we see. There is hardly ambiguity.Even that most quintessential Asian, Bruce Lee, was in that quaint phrase, “Eurasian.” His public persona was exotic. Yet his actual heritage was common enough where he grew up.When the terms “Oriental” and the less polite “Chinaman” were still in common use, Lee achieved fame that was unprecedented and global. Despite having been passed over for the Kung Fu television series, a role that went to a Caucasian who was accomplished as a dancer, the martial arts expert went on to star in his own stories on the big screen, establishing himself as masculine, powerful, and virile.He also was at least one-quarter European in lineage. He was a member of a prominent house in Hong Kong. His genealogy led to controversy within the then-closed society of Eastern fighting schools. He insisted, to the further indignation of his peers, on training people of all origins, boasting a star student who was African American. As a consequence, he was challenged to prove his right to continue practicing his trade. The battle with Wong Jack Man in Oakland has become myth.His death at an early age of a brain hemorrhage, as he was developing what would have been the first big-budget Hollywood martial arts picture, was attributed by conspiracy theorists to a curse for sharing kung fu secrets with outsiders. He has become all the more a legend since then. His appeal is universal. His counsel was, “Be like water, my friend.”All but forgotten is that he was a native-born American, coming into the world in that most Chinese of cities, San Francisco, California. Thanks to the Supreme Court case affirming birthright citizenship, brought by one Wong Kim Ark of the same hometown, son of immigrants who could not naturalize due to a racial bar, Lee, like others who can claim roots on this soil, was legally an equal.Asian Americans have sought to appropriate the term “hapa” to cover these persons. A Hawaiian word, it originally was derogatory. It has been taken over as celebratory.There are many examples, beyond Asians and Asian Americans, of public race and private identity being mismatched. The phenomenon harkens back to the “one drop” rule reflecting a philosophy that any “black” blood taints the purity of whiteness. “Passing” has been practiced likely from the first encounter of populations with differing statuses correlated to color.Salma Hayek, for example, is internationally admired as a Mexican movie star. She is as Mexican as could be. Yet she has become an American citizen. In terms of ancestry, she is only half what she is regarded as; her father is Lebanese. For that matter, Frida Kahlo, whom Hayek portrayed in a hit biopic, is revered as a Mexican painter and feminist heroine. Yet Kahlo was like Hayek. her father was German, and, in the narrative Kahlo herself promoted, Jewish — though later investigation has suggested he was German but not Jewish.The point is that racial categories are social constructs. They correlate only approximately to their supposed biological basis. And racial blending is neither new nor rare. The possibility is what makes us all human."

Had you not, I don’t know if I would have extended a hand.When I first saw you in the neighborhood, I avoided eye contact. I couldn’t see pass the hijab. Your headscarf represented to me a religion of extremes, a culture of anti-Semitism and a stifling of the modern woman. I quickly concluded we were from different worlds and hence, unable to find common ground - until we did.Our sons’ fast friendship led to ours. Several conversations, a few CrossFit WODs and a shared hookah later, my eyes shifted their focus.Your commitment to Islam is rooted in a spirituality that transcends all religions.When asked, “What did you learn from making pilgrimage to Mecca?” you told the young people at the local mosque that in light of the experience, both positive and negative, you returned grateful for the gifts God gives us as free, healthy human beings and with an understanding that He loves us, imperfections and all.At home, you demonstrate your love for God through modesty, daily prayer, study and diet. But that love is also deeply evident in the thoughtful way in which you respect yourself, interact with others, approach parenting, nurture relationships and care for patients.Your words and actions remind me we are all connected. You have an open, accepting and generous heart.  As a Christian woman raising Jewish children married to a man with a strong connection to Israel, I was worried my friendship with someone of Palestinian descent might be tricky. I was wrong. From day one, you welcomed my family into your home. You taught us about your culture, answered questions, appreciated our traditions, and even joined us for holidays. When my son swallowed a marble, you were at my door despite having worked a full day. When I had jury duty, you spent the afternoon with my boys even though your children had busy schedules of their own. You think of my family whenever you cook or travel and thanks to your charming sweet tooth, my children affectionately refer to you as “The Candy Fairy.” The goodness that emanates from you inspires me be better.You are an advocate for women; a role model for your son and daughters.Your dress may be traditional, but your ideas are progressive, willful and strong. I was moved when in an effort to understand practices, question inequities and evoke change, you approached Muslim women in the streets of Mecca and asked how they felt wearing a khimar, a long garment covering their head, neck, and shoulders, ran errands in pants to encourage dialogue and questioned local leaders about the sanitation of the city.Every day I watch you work tirelessly to support your family, use your education to help others, handle conflict and struggle with grace and perseverance, tackle new adventures with uncanny energy, act zany, be fun and simply love life.You are an exemplary, modern American woman who I feel proud to call friend.Connection and communication helped me confront prejudice, challenge stereotypes and understand a culture I knew only through media, politics and hearsay. I have renewed hope for future generations when I see our sons playing, laughing and treating each other as brothers.The hijab is but a frame for the beautiful person you are outside and within.

25,POLITICS,The Party Of Honest Abe Now Stuck With Dishonest Don,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-historic-liar_us_57a72edce4b03ba680129d06,Historians see in Trump the biggest liar in presidential politics. Ever.,2016-08-07,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump amps up his attacks on Democratic rival Hillary Clinton as a ""liar"" at a New Hampshire rally Saturday. Some historians, though, see Trump as the most dishonest presidential candidate in American history.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON – Win or lose this November, Donald Trump is headed for the record books regardless, presidential historians say, albeit with an admittedly dubious achievement: the most falsehood-prone candidate in the two centuries of the republic.“In American history, we’ve never had a major presidential candidate who fabricated facts with the regularity of Donald Trump,” said Douglas Brinkley, a history professor at Rice University. “He just simply makes up things.”In the span of a few days last week, Trump falsely claimed that the NFL had sent him a letter complaining about this autumn’s debate schedule, when in fact it had not. He claimed that the Koch brothers had tried to meet with him about offering their support, when in reality they had no interest in doing so. And, most astonishingly, he claimed he had seen a video showing hundreds of millions of dollars being unloaded from a plane in Iran, fabricating embellishments about the video’s provenance, even after his campaign conceded that no such video existed.Theda Skocpol, a government and sociology professor at Harvard, agreed that Trump’s dishonesties have set a new standard. “Trump lies constantly and shamelessly. I do think he is in new territory,” she said.GOP leaders trying to attack Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton over her problems with honesty, meanwhile, are growing increasingly frustrated with their own candidate’s near-daily false statements. “What can I say? We nominated a fabulist,” said one top Republican official privately. “There’s no defending that.”Trump’s willingness to say things that are provably untrue, of course, is not something that began with his campaign. The 70-year-old has been known for his exaggerations and outright fabrications for decades.When he bought the Eastern Airlines Washington-to-New York shuttle in 1989 and renamed it Trump Airlines, he claimed, without any facts, that the other carrier operating that route did not maintain its planes as well as he did.Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, he claimed stakes in properties in which he had no ownership interest, but was merely licensing the use of his name or was in line to collect a percentage of future profits. When confronted by lawyers in a 2007 deposition about this, he at first insisted that he was correct, but then replied that not having ownership was actually smarter because it was not possible for him to lose any money should the investment tank.In 1991, at the age of 45, he invented a pseudonym for himself, called a gossip columnist and told her that “his boss,” Donald Trump, was dating Italian model Carla Bruni, when in fact he’d met her only once, a year earlier.Last summer, in the early stages of his campaign, he told a Rolling Stone reporter riding aboard his private jetliner that it was larger than Air Force One – even though his Boeing 757 is nowhere near the size of the modified 747 used by the president.And this spring – still stinging from former GOP nominee Mitt Romney’s speech ridiculing his various failed branded businesses – Trump pointed to a table of raw steaks and declared them “Trump Steaks,” even though that product has not been available for close to a decade.A Republican consultant close to the Trump campaign, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said Trump’s behavior is typical among wealthy candidates he has worked with.“All those years in public life, nobody cared about the veracity of statements they made outside their business, which is the only place truth matters to them,” the consultant said. “Many people ― close staff, family ― let him go on about things for years and just roll their eyes, some afraid to say, ‘Stop it.’ Because it’s a sideshow, doesn’t matter. Then, suddenly, it matters. But the habit is there, set in stone.”Falsehoods For The Sake Of FalsehoodsIn Trump’s case, whether the word “lie” technically describes his falsehoods is unclear. By definition, “lying” means knowingly and purposefully misrepresenting facts. In Trump’s case, he often appears not to understand the difference between what he is saying and actual reality.“I can’t think of any presidential candidate, Republican or Democrat, in recent American history who wasn’t accused of lying. It’s the nature of the job, almost, to skew facts toward a political end,” said University of Memphis historian Aram Goudsouzian. “But Trump lies more frequently, and on a larger scale. Most important, even when confronted with contrary evidence, he still insists that he is right. It is a special kind of delusion.”“There have been candidates who embellished reality. Ronald Reagan sometimes remembered things that he actually remembered from a movie,” Rice University’s Brinkley said. “Nixon lied on purpose. He was lying to advance an idea forward. Donald Trump doesn’t even know he’s doing it, it’s so much part of his modus operandi.”He added: “There’s something psychologically warped with someone who sees no distinction between facts and fiction at all. The sign of crazy is when someone believes his own bullshit. And he believes his own B.S.: Everything he says is true because he said it.”Reagan’s confusion, as it turned out, may have been an early symptom of the Alzheimer’s diagnosis that was revealed in 1994, nearly six years after he left the White House.If Trump is afflicted with any form of dementia, though, it’s something that has been going on for quite some time. In 2006, at age 60, Trump held a fundraiser for Florida’s Charlie Crist, then running for governor as a Republican, at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach. Trump spoke for close to 45 minutes, talking about all the redecorating he had undertaken to the various rooms there, about his reality TV program, about all sorts of things related to Trump ― but said nothing about Crist. The candidate, in fact, was not even offered the opportunity to speak.Trump’s need to invent facts about his own success appears to be a trait associated with narcissistic personality disorder, according to mental health professionals who have studied his public remarks, with the possibility that the malady may be antisocial personality disorder ― formerly known as sociopathy.That certainly was the assessment of Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R), who, on the day he lost the critical Indiana primary in May, lashed out at Trump’s relationship with facts. “This man is a pathological liar. He doesn’t know the difference between truth and lies,” Cruz said. “I say pathological because I actually think Donald, if you hooked him up to a lie detector test, he could say one thing in the morning, one thing at noon and one thing in the evening, all contradictory. And he’d pass the lie detector test each time. Whatever lie he’s telling, at that minute he believes it.”Whether Trump’s behavior is actually a sign of mental illness is something only a professional assessment could determine, and it’s unknown whether Trump has ever sought one. His campaign did not respond to queries, and the physician who wrote a letter attesting to Trump’s health ― which closed with the line: “If elected, Mr. Trump, I can state unequivocally, will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency” ― declined to speak to The Huffington Post.Clinton’s Honesty Harder To Challenge With TrumpWhatever the reason behind Trump’s falsehoods, they have complicated the Republican Party’s efforts to use Clinton’s low scores for honesty and trustworthiness against her.For 25 years, Republicans have characterized both former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton as fundamentally dishonest, and the party has been working to make that case against her presidential campaign since it began last year.Even as Clinton prepared to accept the nomination last month in Philadelphia, the RNC staged a news conference that afternoon accusing her of lying. “Deception and dishonesty are all second nature to Hillary,” said Arkansas Attorney General Leslie Rutledge. “Hillary will lie even when the truth would serve her better.”But, later, Rutledge seemed at a loss to explain Trump’s falsehoods. “I’m not saying that Donald Trump ― everything he has said, I would advise him to say,” she said.Indeed, an analysis by PolitiFact showed Trump scoring the worst among the major party candidates running for president this election, with 77 percent of his checked statements rated as false. Clinton, in contrast, had 28 percent rated false.Andy Puzder, a top fundraiser for Trump and chairman of the company that owns the Hardee’s restaurant chain, said the comparison was not fair, as Clinton’s dishonesties were worse. Her 2008 statement that her airplane had come under sniper fire upon landing in Bosnia a dozen years earlier, her blaming the 2012 Benghazi terrorist attacks on an anti-Muslim YouTube video, and her much-criticized claims about her use of a private server for her government emails, Puzder said, were far more serious than Trump’s falsehoods.“These are large and material things, and they matter,” he said.But Shawn Steel, an RNC member from California and another fundraiser for Trump, conceded that Trump’s willingness to lie made it much harder for his side to attack Clinton on that front. “Any of the other 16 candidates would have had a much easier time of it,” he said, adding that it didn’t help that Trump’s falsehoods were so obvious and easily refuted. “She’s a far better liar. The quality of a lie from Hillary is on a much more sophisticated level.”And the GOP consultant worried that Trump will be unable to control what’s become part of his lifestyle. “Truth hasn’t mattered for decades, so when it does matter it’s too late to change bad habits,” the consultant said. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

We will see who we have in the military, who we have in the judiciary, and throw the others out of the door.”The parade ground, built to hold more than a million people, was overflowing, with the streets of surrounding neighborhoods clogged by crowds. One presidency official put the numbers at around five million and the event was broadcast live on public screens at smaller rallies across Turkey’s 81 provinces.Since the coup bid, Turkish authorities have suspended, detained or placed under investigation tens of thousands of people, including soldiers, police, judges, journalists, medics and civil servants, prompting concern among Western allies that Erdogan is using the events to tighten his grip on power.Erdogan vowed to rid Turkey of the network of U.S.-based cleric Fethullah Gulen, whose followers in the security forces, judiciary and civil service he accuses of orchestrating the attempted power grab and of plotting to overthrow the state.Erdogan said he would approve the restoration of the death penalty if parliament voted for it, a move which would sink any hopes of European Union membership. Shrugging off EU concerns, he said much of the rest of the world had capital punishment.Gulen - an ally of Erdogan in the early years after his Islamist-rooted AK Party took power in 2002 - has denied any involvement in the coup, which came at a critical time for a NATO “frontline” state facing Islamist militant attacks from across the border in Syria and an insurgency by Kurdish rebels.In a rare appearance at a public rally, military chief Hulusi Akar said the “traitors” behind the plot would be punished and he thanked civilians for their role in putting it down. Many of the more than 240 people killed on July 15 were civilians who tried to prevent the takeover of power.The leader of the main secularist opposition, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, said a “new door of compromise” had been opened and that politics must be kept out of the mosques, courthouses and barracks. “There is a new Turkey after July 15,” he said.“FREEDOM OR DEATH”Erdogan, a polarizing figure seen by opponents as intolerant of dissent, invited the heads of the secularist and nationalist opposition parties to address the crowds in a display of national unity in defiance of Western criticism.“We’re here to show that these flags won’t come down, the call to prayer won’t be silenced and our country won’t be divided,” said Haci Mehmet Haliloglu, 46, a civil servant who traveled from the Black Sea town of Ordu for the rally.“This is something way beyond politics, this is either our freedom or death,” he said, a large Turkish flag over his shoulder and a matching baseball cap on his head.Turkey’s top Muslim cleric and chief rabbi also attended. But the pro-Kurdish HDP, the third-largest party in parliament, was not invited due to its alleged links to Kurdish militants, prompting anger on social media from its supporters.The brutality of July 15, in which rogue soldiers commandeered fighter jets, helicopters and tanks, shocked a nation that last saw a violent military power grab in 1980. Even Erdogan’s opponents saw his leadership as preferable to a successful coup renewing the cycle of military interventions that dogged Turkey in the second half of the 20th century.“Erdogan has been brutal and unfair to us in the past, but I believe he has now understood the real importance of the republic’s values,” said Ilhan Girit, 44, a musician and CHP supporter, carrying a flag of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, founder of the modern secular republic.A convoy of nationalists on motorbikes passed as he spoke.Such solidarity may not last. There are already opposition concerns that the restructuring of the military lacks parliamentary oversight and is going too far, with thousands of soldiers discharged, including around 40 percent of generals.WESTERN CRITICISMThe extent of the purges in Turkey, which has NATO’s second largest armed forces and aspires to membership of the European Union, has drawn criticism in the West.In comments published on Sunday, the leader of Germany’s liberal Free Democrats said he saw parallels between Erdogan’s behavior and the aftermath of the Reichstag fire in 1933, portrayed by the Nazis as a Communist plot against the government and used by Adolf Hitler to justify massively curtailing civil liberties.Turkish officials have angrily rejected suggestions that the purges are out of proportion, accusing Western critics of failing to grasp the magnitude of the threat to the Turkish state and of being more concerned about the rights of coup plotters than the brutality of the events themselves.Amid the cooling of ties with the West, Erdogan is due to meet Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday in St Petersburg for talks intended to end a period of tension after Turkey downed a Russian fighter jet near the Syrian border last November.“At the talks with my friend Vladimir, I believe, a new page in bilateral relations will be opened. Our countries have a lot to do together,” Erdogan told the TASS news agency in an interview published on Sunday.In Washington on Sunday several hundred people clad in red and waving Turkish flags gathered in front of the White House in support of Erdogan and to demand that U.S. President Barack Obama deport Gulen to Turkey.“He (Erdogan) has made some mistakes but he is not a dictator,” said Okan Sakar, 35, a Turkish tax inspector currently studying in the United States."

She tearfully held his wrist and chest and quietly nodded.Stepien’s father, Michael Stepien, was killed in a 2006 robbery when she was 23. After he spent 24 hours on life support, the family accepted the inevitable and donated his organs, Stepien told The Huffington Post.At that time, Thomas, who Stepien’s family calls “Tom,” had been waiting nearly 10 years for a heart transplant at his home in New Jersey.“He was going to die if he did not receive a new heart in the next several days,” Stepien told HuffPost via email Sunday. “Tom received my father’s heart within the next 48 hours.”The Christmas following his transplant he wrote to Stepien’s family thanking them for what they had done.The families kept in touch through letters and phone calls over the years but it wasn’t until they started planning Jeni Stepien’s wedding that she saw the perfect chance for them to meet.“When my fiancé proposed, one of the first things I thought of was ‘but who will walk me down the aisle?’ I could think of nobody more meaningful than Tom,” she said. “My fiancé suggested I write him a letter; that way Tom would feel in no way obligated or pressured by my request.”A few days after sending the letter she got a phone call, she said. Tom’s answer was yes. She met him for the first time on Friday.“Meeting Tom was so incredible!” she said. “He is such a gracious and kind-hearted man. You could tell he was so thankful for his life, and that radiated from him.”The decision to invite Thomas brought joy to her entire family, Stepien added.“My mother was very touched by the idea also and thought it was a very appropriate gesture to honor my father. I knew how important it would be for her and my sister to receive this piece of closure by finally meeting Tom as well,” she said.“I wanted to make the day special for everyone, not just for myself.”In sharing her story, Stepien said she hopes it sends a message to others: Organ donors do matter.“Organ donation can provide an opportunity for a second chance at life. It is an exceptional gift, one that is selfless and generous, and always appreciated by the recipient,” she said. “We were able to see how wonderfully Tom was progressing all of these years, simply thriving, and [that] in turn, helped us with our own grief.”This story has been updated to include Stepien’s comments."

The daughter of Courtney Love and the late Kurt Cobain shared a video on Instagram over the weekend, giving her followers the chance to hear her vocal chops. In the clip, the 23-year-old sings a snippet of Jimmy Eat World’s “The Middle.” Cobain made her singing debut back in 2010 when she appeared on a track called “My Space” by Evelyn Evelyn, which also featured My Chemical Romance’s Gerard Way and Weird Al Yankovic, among others. However, this is the first time we’ve really heard her voice stripped down, and we’ll admit, we’re impressed. Mom Courtney Love saw the video and made sure to send some love to her daughter by reposting it on her own Instagram account.“I know your father is very proud of this as am I baby, I love you to the moon and back,” Love wrote. Here’s to hoping we get a mother-daughter duet in the future. "
30,COLLEGE,Law Professors Defend Use Of Preponderance Standard In Campus Rape Cases,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/preponderance-of-evidence-college-sexual-assault_us_57a4a6a4e4b056bad215390a,"Arguing for a higher standard of proof would mean sexual harassment is treated differently than any other type of discrimination, they assert.",2016-08-07,"Three lawsuits accuse the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights, led by Catherine Lhamon, pictured above, of inappropriately telling schools to use the preponderance of evidence standard in college sexual assault cases.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a4bf5d2a0000fa01fb4f53.jpeg?cache=zMXg4y5e3r&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of more than 90 law professors from at least 50 different universities signed onto a white paper, released Sunday, defending the U.S. Department of Education’s guidance on how colleges should handle sexual assault cases.Specifically, the law professors focus on how much proof is needed to determine whether a student accused of sexual assault is guilty in the eyes of their college or university. A “Dear Colleague” letter released by the Education Department’s Office for Civil Rights in April 2011 was considered a wake-up call for schools to honor their obligation to handle sexual violence involving students under the gender equity law Title IX.However, some groups have said a portion of the letter ― which told schools to use the “preponderance of evidence” standard in adjudicating sexual assault allegations as code of conduct violations ― amounted to issuing new regulations without going through a legally required process. It’s currently the subject of three federal lawsuits against the Education Department. The preponderance standard essentially means an accused person can be found guilty if the adjudicator or panel believes there’s a 51 percent chance the allegations against the individual are true. In other words, a jury would rule based on whose side they believe more.“The national debate over campus sexual assault often deals with pretty deep and complicated legal issues, even for lawyers,” said Nancy Chi Cantalupo, a Barry University School of Law professor who organized the white paper.“I wanted to help provide a resource to the public about one of those deep and complicated issues, to put the issue in the context of Title IX’s legal history and of our legal system as a whole,” Cantalupo said. “Many people seem to think of the law as just one kind of law: the criminal law, but there are many other kinds of law, including civil rights law.”The preponderance standard is used in civil lawsuits. In criminal courts, there’s a higher standard to establish someone’s guilt: “proof beyond a reasonable doubt,” meaning there’s hardly any chance the accused person isn’t guilty. Organizations like the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, the American Association of University Professors and national fraternity groups have argued the preponderance standard is too low and doesn’t provide enough protection for accused students. But the white paper from the law professors argues that this is a civil rights issue, and the preponderance of the evidence standard is one that’s always used to adjudicate discrimination claims under other civil rights statutes, like the portions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prohibit discrimination based on race and harassment in the workplace.If the Dear Colleague letter had expressed permission for other standards of evidence, the professors say, it would’ve “approved treating sexual violence and harassment victims differently from all other victims of all other discrimination prohibited under our nation’s anti-discrimination civil rights laws, and done so without any justification for that differentiation.”There appears to be no concern about “the use of the preponderance standard of evidence in handling allegations of racial harassment on campus,” the professors wrote. And students accused of sexual assault who are suing their universities, claiming they were treated unfairly, will have their lawsuits determined under the preponderance standard, should they go to trial. Chicago-Kent College of Law’s Katharine Baker, one of the organizers of the white paper, said the professors wanted to speak out because of the confusion caused by media coverage of sexual violence on campus. “There is a mistaken tendency to assume that the Department of Education is policing rape on college campuses and should therefore use the background norms of criminal law as an appropriate model for adjudication procedures,” Baker told The Huffington Post. “In fact, the department is responding to the overwhelming evidence that a culture of male sexual entitlement permeates college campuses and that women suffer disproportionately from having to live, study, and try to learn in that environment.” At least 90 law professors from more than 50 schools signed the paper as of Sunday evening, but the organizers expect more to add their names.

And while it’s really none of our business, many ― including his former girlfriend Julianne Hough and apparently Britney Spears ― assumed the TV personality was gay. Over the weekend, an old clip of Seacrest interviewing Spears and Black Eyed Peas member Will.I.Am went viral, with many claiming it shows the exact moment the “Piece of Me” singer realized Seacrest is straight. In the clip, Will.I.Am and Seacrest are talking about cologne and Will asks, “You spray cologne on your girl?” A seemingly dumbfounded Spears appears to react by mouthing “girl?” to no one in particular while looking extremely confused. It’s priceless. Check out the funny moment below:"

You'll have 1,122 feet and 0.54 inches of rock above you - and look very cute in a yellow hard hat.The story has it that in July 1623 Helga and Jacob were shepherding Daddy's herds in the hills and dales when a bull scraped his horns against the mountainside and, lo and behold, something glistened. They took it home to Dad. OK, all that glistens isn't gold, but Dad knew right away that it was silver. He started melting and selling it in the local market, even though all minerals belonged to the king.Well, Christian IV of Denmark, with whom Norway was then in union, was not amused. He threatened to give Dad the chop if he didn't reveal where he found the silver. As the chop was not from a lamb but an axe, Dad willingly revealed the location of the precious, Christian visited, founding the town of Kongsberg (King's Mountain), and that's how I'm now in the hall of the mountain king. The mine functioned from 1623 until 1958, when it became uneconomical. During that time 450,000 man-years were spent producing 1,300 tons of silver.

It's pissing down in Kristiansand and wanderlust sets me aboard the one bus a day for the 3 ½-hours' trip. Once out of town the weather works its enchantment despite, or rather because of the rain. Mists and clouds swirl in the forested mountain folds, spreading evanescent veils over the fir trees. More clouds hover like greyish-white wads of cotton wool over the wooded hummock islands of Lake Byglandsfjord, and the glorious neon greens of moss and other plants glimmer with a mystic glow. Yellow and purple flowers welcome the steady downpour while the occasional hiker is all kitted out in waterproof trousers and jacket.

It's easy to understand. It covers the mental, emotional and physical aspects of depression, and even quantifies just how depressed you might be, dependent on your answers.Often, people who are moderately depressed don't realize how slowly the lights have gone down on the joy or satisfaction with their life. They can't see how much they are struggling with negativity, irritability or sadness. They are blind to the many ways they're isolating from others, or beginning to pull into themselves.Depression can happen so slowly you don't realize how hard life has become.Then it's shocking one day when you start to imagine your own death -- or some kind of escape from the world you're living in. If given an inventory, your answers surprise you as they reveal how dark your life has become.Depression has entrenched itself into who you are and how you think.It's taken you away from the ability to see opportunity, realize options or focus on others.The disease of depression robs you of your vitality.It's all you can do to function. But you do. You make yourself. You have responsibilities.You take your kids to school, but go back to bed.You go to work, but can't focus. So you give people excuses why you're not meeting a deadline.You are constantly berating yourself for what you aren't, what you haven't accomplished, or who you could have been, if given the chance.This is depression. If severe enough, you lose your desire or ability to function at all.The good news is that often you can get better. With exercise, therapy, medication, mindfulness, and hard work, many can lift the veil that has cut them off from the enjoyment of life.Some struggle more than that, and have to learn to manage chronic symptoms. That's a very tough way to live.So how is Perfectly Hidden Depression (PHD) different from any of this?One man recently answered that question. ""The inventory is asking the wrong question for me. I would answer a resounding 'no' to the statement, 'I often feel hopeless.' I wouldn't admit feeling hopeless, to anyone, ever. The question should be, 'If you could admit feeling hopeless, would you?' The answer again would be ""no,"" but it would reveal PHD.""  Perfectly Hidden Depression is a syndrome, or a set of characteristics and behaviors that enable people to hide or detach from emotional pain. That doesn't mean the pain isn't there, or that it's not having an effect.Doing all things to the best of your ability, all the time, every day. Pushing yourself to the limit. Putting others before yourself, always, believing that a focus on self is selfish. Living very deliberately, getting things done, accomplishing the seemingly impossible.Ignoring the memories of hurt. Avoiding revealing too much about yourself. Laughing off extreme fatigue.You don a mask of happiness every day, that you may even have come to believe is the real thing. Others admire and tell you what a great life you have. You're extremely invested in maintaining that image.The Beck Depression Inventory would never reveal PHD. Because whoever was taking it, would know someone else would see their answers.That's not acceptable, or so they have told themselves.While someone with classic depression may struggle to admit it, or may fear they will be stigmatized if they do, they're more likely to be honest about what they're experiencing. They have to -- the symptoms are choking the life out of them.Someone with PHD?Only when life starts becoming too complicated, when their sense of panic about things getting out of control starts rising, are they likely to consider revealing who they are, or attempt to confront what they've been telling themselves.Let's change that.Because sometimes, someone with PHD will wait too long. You will want to end your life, and no one even knows you need help. The loneliness can become unbearable.Because showing vulnerability does not equate with lack of strength. It simply doesn't.Because although many of the things that someone with PHD focuses on are admirable, being invisible hurts.You don't need to hide.Thank you for your help in reading and sharing this message.

SilvaLOCAL DIFFERENCE – The Africapitalism philosophy goes beyond the old concept of capitalism. For the Nigerian banker Tony Elumelu, the African private sector can transform the continent through long term investments, simultaneously creating economic prosperity and social wealth.Weak governments are good for business. For years, global firms strongly believed in this concept, and were attracted to Africa because of the opportunities presented by poor regulation, cheap labour, tax evasion and abundant raw materials. Multinational corporations were able to expand across the continent.Challenging the contemporary capitalism model is the goal of the so-called Africapitalism movement. This term, created by the multimillionaire Nigerian banker Tony Elumelu, is based on the idea that private investment can be transformed into social wealth.""The philosophy basically says that Africa's private sector should lead in the continent's development. Africa should not depend only on aid from outside,"" says Parminder Vir, the Chief Executive Officer of the Tony Elumelu Foundation. They believe that foreign aid to Africa did not help develop the continent, and that it stimulated corruption instead.""If you look at the 100 most admired brands in Africa, 70 per cent of them are non-African,"" says Thebe Ikalafeng, the Founder of the African brand and reputation advisory firm, Brand Leadership. ""That means the 70 per cent of the agenda is non-African."" He thinks that Africans need to fund business and brands in Africa to create jobs and invest it in their agenda.According to The Economist, one of the main goals for African governments over the next ten years is to keep improving roads, pushing out grasping officials and lowering the tariff barriers that still hobble trade between African countries. (Trade with neighbouring countries makes up only 11 per cent of total African exports and imports.) ""Have you tried to travel between two African countries? It is impossible!"" Vir says.Africa's future rests on the productivity of its people. By 2050, the UN predicts that there will be 2.5 billion Africans, a quarter of the world's population. ""I believe that in 50 years Africa will be the land of opportunity,"" Vir says. ""In the next 10 years, we will see an economic revolution guided by young entrepreneurs.""This rising generation of Africapitalists believe the private sector can solve Africa's development challenges more effectively and with greater sustainability than either the philanthropic or public sector. ""Some economies across Africa, Nigeria being the classic example, became too dependent on oil,"" Vir says.Nigeria actually derives more than 90 per cent of its export revenue from oil, which has recently plummeted far below the price needed to draw in new investors. ""And it has become imperative to diversify those economies,"" Vir says. The role of governments is to build political stability and consistent policies to stimulate economic growth. ""It is building institutions that can really train the next generations of leaders,"" she says.A year ago, The Tony Elumelu Foundation launched a USD 100 million entrepreneurship programme with the goal of supporting the education and development of 10,000 African entrepreneurs over the next ten years. Adeloye Olanrewaju, a 24-year-old Nigerian, was a part of this programme; he is a Leader of Tomorrow at the St. Gallen Symposium. He created an app called SaferMom to monitor the health of mothers and their newborns. ""I had a great experience creating my start-up. We also had the best mentors."" His startup received The Queen's Young Leaders Awards, among others. ""The principles on which Africapitalism is founded are ones of responding to inequality by empowering young entrepreneurs,"" Vir explains. CHINESE INVASION?Africapitalists will have to prove if it is possible to do good and make money at the same time. They are under pressure: The rise of Chinese investments in Africa has increased significantly in the recent years, to the point that some call it Chinese neocolonialism. Some argue the exchange can be mutually beneficial. Vir says Africa simply needs Chinese capital to build infrastructure and China needs African resources. Others say Africa's prices are set too low. ""The African problem is that we are too desperate and we accept that kind of support at any cost,"" says Ikalafeng. ""We should be more aggressive, more determined, and more decisive in fighting for investment in our own terms. Those terms are what moves our agenda forwards. Our agenda is what makes Africa economically independent."" Parminder Vir, CEO of The Tony Elumulu Foundation and Thebe Ikalafeng, Founder and Group CEO of Brand Leadership, were Speakers at the 46th St. Gallen Symposium (11–13 May 2016) held on the topic ""Growth – the good, the bad, and the ugly"""
37,BUSINESS,Stress Literally Shrinks Your Brain (7 Ways To Reverse This Effect),"Dr. Travis Bradberry, ContributorAuthor of #1 bestselling book, Emotional Intelligence 2.0, and...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stress-literally-shrinks_b_11353274.html,"We all know that living under stressful conditions has serious emotional, even physical, consequences. So why do we have so much trouble taking action to reduce our stress levels and improve our lives?",2016-08-07,2016-08-05-1470418544-8781493-StressLiterallyShrinksYourBrain8WaysToReverseThisEffectHP.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-08-05-1470418544-8781493-StressLiterallyShrinksYourBrain8WaysToReverseThisEffectHP-thumb.jpg,"We all know that living under stressful conditions has serious emotional, even physical, consequences. So why do we have so much trouble taking action to reduce our stress levels and improve our lives?Researchers at Yale University finally have the answer. They found that stress reduces the volume of grey matter in the areas of the brain responsible for self-control.So experiencing stress actually makes it more difficult to deal with future stress because it diminishes your ability to take control of the situation, manage your stress and keep things from getting out of control.A vicious cycle if there ever was one.But don't be disheartened. It's not impossible to reduce your stress levels; you just need to make managing stress a higher priority if you want to reverse this effect. The sooner you start managing your stress effectively, the easier it will be to keep unexpected stress from causing damage in the future.""The greatest weapon against stress is our ability to choose one thought over another."" -William JamesLuckily, the plasticity of the brain allows it to mold, change, and rebuild damaged areas as you practice new behaviors. So implementing healthy stress-relieving techniques can train your brain to handle stress more effectively and decrease the likelihood of ill effects from stress in the future.Here are seven strategies to help you fix your brain and keep your stress under control:1. Say NoSaying no is indeed a major challenge for many people. ""No"" is a powerful word that you should not be afraid to wield. When it's time to say no, avoid phrases such as ""I don't think I can"" or ""I'm not certain."" Saying no to a new commitment honors your existing commitments and gives you the opportunity to successfully fulfill them.2. DisconnectTechnology enables constant communication and the expectation that you should be available 24/7. It is extremely difficult to enjoy a stress-free moment outside of work when an email that will change your train of thought and get you thinking (read: stressing) about work can drop onto your phone at any moment.Taking regular time off the grid helps you to keep your stress under control and to live in the moment. When you make yourself available to your work 24/7, you expose yourself to a constant barrage of stressors. Forcing yourself offline and even--gulp!--turning off your phone gives your body and mind a break. Studies have shown that something as simple as a weekend e-mail break can lower stress levels.If detaching yourself from work-related communication on weekday evenings is too big a challenge, then how about the weekend? Choose blocks of time where you will cut the cord and go offline. You'll be amazed by how refreshing these breaks are and how they reduce stress by putting a mental recharge into your weekly schedule.If you are worried about the negative repercussions of taking this step, try first doing it at times you are unlikely to be contacted--maybe Sunday morning. As you grow more comfortable with this, and as your coworkers begin to accept the time you spend offline, gradually expand the amount of time you spend away from technology.3. Neutralize Toxic PeopleDealing with difficult people is frustrating, exhausting, and highly stressful for most. You can control your interactions with toxic people by keeping your feelings in check. When you need to confront a toxic person, approach the situation rationally. Identify your own emotions and don't allow anger or frustration to fuel the chaos. Also, consider the difficult person's standpoint and perspective so that you can find solutions and common ground. Even when things completely derail, you can take the toxic person with a grain of salt to avoid letting him or her bring you down.4. Don't Hold GrudgesThe negative emotions that come with holding onto a grudge are actually a stress response. Just thinking about the event sends your body into fight-or-flight mode, a survival mechanism that forces you to stand up and fight or run for the hills when faced with a threat. When the threat is imminent, this reaction is essential to your survival, but when the threat is ancient history, holding onto that stress wreaks havoc on your body and can have devastating health consequences over time. In fact, researchers at Emory University have shown that holding onto stress contributes to high blood pressure and heart disease. Holding onto a grudge means you're holding onto stress, and emotionally intelligent people know to avoid this at all costs. Letting go of a grudge not only makes you feel better now but can also improve your health.5. Practice MindfulnessMindfulness is a simple, research-supported form of meditation that is an effective way to gain control of unruly thoughts and behaviors. People who practice mindfulness regularly are more focused, even when they are not meditating. It is an excellent technique to help reduce stress because it allows you to reduce the feeling of being out of control. Essentially, mindfulness helps you stop jumping from one thought to the next, which keeps you from ruminating on negative thoughts. Practicing mindfulness might even increase your score on an emotional intelligence test. Overall, it's a great way to make it through your busy day in a calm and productive manner.6. Put Things In PerspectiveOur worries often come from our own skewed perception of events. So before you spend too much time dwelling on what your boss said during the last staff meeting, take a minute to put the situation in perspective. If you aren't sure when you need to do this, try looking for clues that your anxiety may not be proportional to the stressor. If you are thinking in broad sweeping statements like ""Everything is going wrong"" or ""Nothing will work out"" then you need to reframe the situation. A great way to correct this unproductive thought pattern is to list the specific things that actually are going wrong or not working out. Most likely you will come up with just one or two things--not everything. The key to keeping your cool is to remember that your feelings are exaggerating the situation and the scope of the stressor is much more limited than it might appear.7. Use Your Support SystemIt's tempting, yet entirely ineffective, to attempt tackling everything by yourself. To be calm and productive you need to recognize your weaknesses and ask for help when you need it. This means tapping into your support system when a situation is challenging enough for you to feel overwhelmed.Everyone has someone at work and/or outside work who is on their team, rooting for them, and ready to help them get the best from a difficult situation. Identify these individuals in your life and make an effort to seek their insights and assistance when you need it. Something as simple as talking about your worries will provide an outlet for your anxiety and stress and supply you with a new perspective on the situation. Most of the time, other people can see a solution that you can't because they are not as emotionally invested in the situation. Asking for help will mitigate your anxiety and strengthen your relationships with those you rely upon.Bringing It All TogetherAs simple as these strategies may seem, they are difficult to implement when your mind is clouded with stress. Force yourself to attempt them the next time your head is spinning, and you'll reap the benefits that come with disciplined stress management.How do you manage stress?

It convinces you not to try anything that might risk failure.",2016-08-07,2016-07-31-1469999459-4438419-womanredrocksarmsup.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-07-31-1469999459-4438419-womanredrocksarmsup-thumb.jpg,"Earlier this year, I was asked to give a keynote speech on the subject of what I'd learned after interviewing 100+ women about their midlife awakenings and reinventions -- and how I'd transformed my life in the process. I wanted to say no. I voiced my doubts that I'd be a good candidate, but was pressed to reconsider. What was holding me back? In one word: Fear. Who was I to speak with any type of authority? What could I possibly say to fill the allotted 45-60 minutes? What if no one registered for my talk? Or what if they came but hated what I had to say? And how would I tame my fear of public speaking? I mean, I hadn't given a speech in over two decades, since my corporate days, and I certainly had never spoken publicly about my own journey. Fear is insidious. It preys on you, urging you to play it safe. It convinces you not to try anything that might risk failure. And every time you give in to it, every time you do its bidding, fear wins. It reinforces your belief that you CAN'T.   Fear keeps you small.But when you push through the fear by taking bold action, you prove something to yourself; you learn that yes, you can. And with each step you take outside your comfort zone, that challenges your fear, the way you see yourself changes. Your self-definition slowly adjusts; it grows to encompass the new things you've shown yourself capable of. I finally said yes to the speaking opportunity. I wrote, endlessly practiced and delivered my speech. I shared the advice I had learned from the 100+ women I'd interviewed at the time, along with my own journey from suburban wife and mom to city writer and life coach. The sell-out audience listened and laughed and applauded. I felt supported and embraced by this community of women. Some stayed after to talk to me, to tell me how much my message, ""it's never too late,"" had resonated with them. There was even a reporter there to interview me, who wrote a lovely article in the local paper. And now I think of myself as someone who CAN draw a crowd, who CAN deliver a speech, who CAN overcome my fears. I have since said yes to three other speaking opportunities, and with each experience, I reinforce my belief that I CAN speak publicly, that I have something to say, that I'm worthy of an audience. So if courage is taking action in the face of fear, then yes, I'm a courageous person. And this new confidence is what has led me to launch this column, Coach's Corner. While my blog to date has focused solely on interviews with inspirational women, and I've only rarely dipped my toe into personal musings (see ""My Fuck You Fifties"" on Huffington Post), I've been holding out-- though have a lot to say --mostly out of fear of judgment. With Coach's Corner, I'm moving toward the fear, rather than letting it keep me safe- -and small. And I plan on ignoring the internet trolls!When fear comes to call, ask yourself: What would you do if you knew you couldn't fail? Then take one step, one small step, toward that fear. And watch it shrink.What is a fear that's keeping YOU small? How can YOU begin to move toward that fear?

The best people to design and implement solutions are those facing the problems in the first place. We aim to make high impact, culturally relevant micro grants. Supporting grassroots changemakers, most of whom are commonly overlooked by other funders due to socioeconomic and geographical factors, has proven to be a successful strategy for making meaningful grants around the world.One strategy we employ is 'flow funding', where we put grantmaking decisions in the hands of trusted grantees, each of whom identifies worthwhile projects to fund within their communities. Using their experience of the issues facing communities and their social networks, our team identifies and supports local leaders who are building community resilience. Because these grants are made face to face, through conversation and relationships, our 'flow funders' are also able to support and mentor grant recipients, helping people and projects that would may otherwise not get funded through traditional methods, and fostering new cohorts of empowered, connected, and skilled change makers who enact locally-driven solutions.In Kenya and Uganda, our  East Africa Hub Grantmaking team has identified and made a handful of extraordinary flow fund grants (with another 25-30 grants still to be made in 2016). Our team is supporting grassroots pioneers who are transforming their communities. While these projects are tackling diverse issues, together they paint a picture of a resilient and sustainable future. Congratulations to our 7 recent East Africa Flow Fund Grantees: Emily Auma Oloo, Pawpaw Farming for Improved Livelihood for Poor Farmers, Western State, Kenya. Recognizing the social impact of financial income for women in rural communities, Vincent Atitwa  made his first flow fund to farmer Emily. Funds will be used to help strengthen her farming activities, radically improving the health and living standards of the community.Jimmy Okello,  Stove Making for Energy Conservation, Kitgum, Uganda. Fighting climate change at a community level by producing energy saving stoves that reduce the consumption of fire wood and reduce exposure to dangerous fumes, this group are changing lives and saving the planet! Jimmy Amone is supporting this project with a flow fund that will enable the production and distribution of many more stoves to community members.Carolyne Adhiambo Oloo, Stawi Women, Bondo, Kenya. Empowering widows by training them on their rights and opening up avenues for income generating activities. Tired of seeing widowed women treated like property, Sitawa Wafula was so fired up by Carolyne's passion and drive for working with widows that she has selected her to receive this flow fund. The grant supports efforts to ensure that widowed w‎omen are seen as humans with rights!Jimmy Otim, Health Care Alliance, Lira, Uganda. Providing palliative and nursing care for the elderly, especially those living with disabilities. After witnessing the lack of options for care for those facing health concerns, Suzan Wilmot is thrilled to give her first flow fund to Jimmy to help create an earned income stream for elderly people and those with disabilities, rebuilding their social safety net!Nathan Mukabire, Mayuge Tweziimbe Welding Skills for the Youth, Mayuge, Uganda. Helping youth become self reliant through welding training and empowerment activities. Observing how hard it is for young people in Uganda to be able to find work, Batale Fred saw the potential for Nathan's work to help young people make a better future for themselves and their country, and is supporting him with a flow fund to help train young people in welding.Franciska Walwenda Ogone, Grandmothers Project, Kisumu, Kenya. Helping widows earn a livelihood through small businesses selling maize. East Africa Hub Fellow David Omondi made a life altering investment in a community of grandmothers in Omambo, by giving his first flow fund grant to 63 year-old Francisca Ogone to help her and participants earn a livelihood without resorting to dangerous, back breaking work.Stephen Muchoki Kimani, Sports With A Mission, Nairobi, Kenya. Using peer to peer education to empower underprivileged young women and girls through sports. Young Women in informal communities face challenging conditions which stifle their potential. Miriam Wambui is proud to support Stephen with a flow fund, helping him to provide young women and girls in informal communities ways to stay healthy and educated! Visit our East Africa Hub Team  and learn how they are re-defining the way we give grants in East Africa.Do you have a project that can change the world for the better?

No firearms were found on O’Neal, who was shot in the back, according to police.Johnson was named in March to lead the department, which is facing accusations of racism and a federal investigation into its practices after the city waited more than a year to release video of a separate 2014 fatal shooting by officers.On Saturday, he said the ongoing investigation prevented him from discussing details about the O’Neal shooting.“I was concerned by some of the things that I saw on the videos and that is why we took such a swift action that we did last week to relieve the three officers of their police powers,” Johnson said.The video footage released on Friday shows two officers firing at a stolen car driven by O’Neal after it sped past them, the car crashing into a police car, and O’Neal running into a backyard where he was shot. It does not show the shooting.Johnson said the lack of a body-camera video of the O’Neal shooting is under investigation, though he noted that the officers in that police district had the cameras for only about a week before the shooting.Civil rights activist Reverend Jesse Jackson said the lack of a complete video accounting of O’Neal’s shooting showed a cover-up and a lawyer for O’Neal’s family called for a special prosecutor to investigate the killing.The union representing Chicago police officers urged the public not to rush to judgment.Dozens of protesters demanding swift action against the officers involved in O’Neal’s shooting demonstrated outside Chicago police headquarters on Friday night.A string of high-profile killings of black men by police in various U.S. cities in the past two years has renewed a national debate about racial discrimination in the criminal justice system and given rise to the Black Lives Matter movement.(Reporting by David Bailey; Editing by Leslie Adler and Paul Simao)"
43,POLITICS,The Green Party Picks Its Presidential Ticket,Eliot Nelson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/green-party-presidential-ticket_us_57a64585e4b03ba680128f32,"Jill Stein is hoping to attract disillusioned Sanders supporters, but she has a tough road ahead.",2016-08-06,"Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein courted Bernie Sanders supporters at the Democratic convention in July before being formally nominated at the Green Party convention in Houston on Saturday, Aug. 6, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a6717b13000029007c360a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"HOUSTON ― The Green Party officially nominated Massachusetts physician and progressive activist Jill Stein as its presidential candidate on Saturday, also selecting human rights activist Ajamu Baraka as her running mate.“We are what democracy looks like and we are what political revolution looks like,” Stein said accepting her party’s nomination. Stein also served as the party’s standard-bearer in 2012, when she received .9 percent of the national popular vote.The radically progressive ticket faces a near-impossible climb electorally, as the Green Party only currently appears on ballots in 21 states and territories, though that number may grow as ballot registration deadlines are reached over the next month. However, the party has already been excluded from the ballot in Indiana, North Carolina and Oklahoma. Green Party officials hope that historically high disapproval ratings of the two major parties’ candidates, buoyed by disillusioned supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) presidential campaign, will give the party its highest turnout yet. However, party officials and activists readily admit they don’t expect to win in November. In a questionnaire submitted to the party by Stein, the candidate wrote that she hoped to “Multiply the Green Party vote totals several-fold over 2012” and “Establish the Green Party as the preeminent progressive opposition party to the bipartisan establishment in Washington.”Recent polling suggests Stein is poised to fare better in 2016 than in her first run and she is averaging roughly 4 percent in polls. However, her numbers have trailed the other major third-party candidate, Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson, who has averaged around 8 percent. Perhaps more notable for Green activists, a recent survey from McClatchy finds Stein pulling more support from voters under 30 than GOP nominee Donald Trump, coming in third with 16 percent. “I want to recognize the people coming out of the Bernie Sanders campaign who helped launched a revolutionary political movement,” Stein told the assembled delegates on Saturday morning during remarks by the party’s presidential candidates. “[T]here will be no stopping you and no stopping us until we have achieved that change that we have all put on the platform together.”“On the day that Bernie Sanders endorsed Hillary Clinton, the floodgates opened on our campaign,” Stein said in her acceptance speech.“Now that they got Bernie Sanders out of the way, they’re going to focus on us!” Iowa delegate Wendy Barth contended. Officials with the Stein campaign and Green Party spent far more of the convention appealing to Democrats disillusioned by Hillary Clinton’s campaign than Republican disillusioned by Donald Trump’s, a not very surprising development given the party’s liberal platform.Convention speakers directly criticized Clinton far more often than Trump, attacking the Democratic nominee for her support of the 2003 invasion of Iraq and ties to Wall Street. “We are hungry for a woman president,” said one delegate during the party’s roll call vote, “but not a war-hungry corporate criminal.” Other speakers at the convention made more pointed appeals to wayward Sanders supporters. “The leader of your revolution has sold you out to a corporate shill warmonger,” one Green presidential candidate, Kent Philip Mesplay, told the crowd Saturday morning. YahNe Ndgo, a progressive activist and former Sanders supporter, accused the Vermont senator of “sheepdogging for Hillary and the Democrats in 2016.” “We cannot be beholden to Bernie Sanders,” Ndgo told the convention. In addition to selecting the party’s presidential ticket, the Green delegates also codified the party’s platform, which includes planks on dramatically ramping up efforts to combat global warming, ending mass incarceration and reducing domestic and foreign surveillance. It also features platform items that fall well to the left of the Democratic Party, including calling for reparations for descendants of slaves and condemning Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory.The Green Party has not been without its share of controversy this election cycle. Stein has come under fire recently for comments that affirmed the science of vaccinations but echoed language used by anti-vaccine activists, as The Huffington Post’s Anna Almendrala noted earlier this month. “Like any medication, [vaccines] also should be — what shall we say? — approved by a regulatory board that people can trust,” Stein told the Washington Post in July.Looking ahead, party officials say one of Stein’s best hopes to gain traction will be to appear in the presidential debates this fall. A lawsuit brought by the Stein and Johnson campaigns against the Commission on Presidential Debates, the body that sets the number of debates and the rules governing them, was thrown out by a federal judge on Friday. Currently, the commission requires candidates to receive at least an average of 15 percent in five nationwide polls in order to participate."
44,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Reminds Voters Of Donald Trump's Past Birther Claims,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-reminds-voters-trump-birther-past_us_57a63fbee4b021fd9878cff7,Because it’s hard to keep track of all the outrages.,2016-08-06,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump may not ever be commander-in-chief, but he has already held the distinction of birther-in-chief.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a6402c13000029007c35d8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Donald Trump once led a national campaign questioning whether President Barack Obama was born in the United States.And the anniversary of one of Trump’s birther outbursts gave rival presidential candidate Hillary Clinton an opportunity to remind us all of his false claims.Clinton retweeted a Trump Twitter post from exactly four years ago on Saturday in which Trump claimed he had new information casting doubt on the authenticity of Obama’s birth certificate.Obama had released his “long form” birth certificate in April 2011 to silence Trump and other members of the so-called birther movement. The president then humiliated Trump in a devastating roast at the White House Correspondents’ Dinner later that month.From the start, the birther movement was widely viewed as a thinly veiled attempt to delegitimize the president by racists outraged that a black man with foreign heritage was elected to the country’s highest office.As if to confirm these perceptions, Trump persisted in his quixotic quest to expose Obama as a fraud even after the White House released his “long form” birth certificate.In addition to challenging the birth certificate’s authenticity, Trump announced in October 2012 that he was offering $5 million for Obama’s college transcripts and passport records. The businessman refused requests to release his own transcripts and passport records.Nothing came of the former reality TV personality’s very public efforts, not only because of how patently offensive they were but also because his claims were clearly not true.Yet Trump has not disavowed his past crusade. He deployed similar tactics against Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) during the Republican primary, questioning whether he was eligible for the presidency since he was born in Canada.He also insinuated that Obama has terrorism ties in the wake of the massacre at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in June.Former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski revived the original birther claims on Tuesday during an appearance on CNN, where he is now a commentator. Lewandowski ignored the birth certificate proof that had already been released and suggested that Obama hadn’t released his Harvard transcripts because they might show he wasn’t a U.S. citizen. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."
45,POLITICS,North Carolina Governor Is Ready To Take Voter ID Fight To The Supreme Court,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/north-carolina-governor-voter-id_us_57a51504e4b056bad215a0c2,"An appeals court found the state's voting law harkened back to ""the era of Jim Crow.""",2016-08-06,"Gov. Pat McCrory (R) calls North Carolina's voter ID law ""common sense,"" but an appeals court called it ""discriminatory.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57a5153f1300002a007c3489.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the states with the most restrictive voting rules in the nation will ask the Supreme Court to step in and let it enforce them in time for the presidential election.North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) said on Friday he’s ready to ask the justices to block an appeals court ruling issued last week that said the state’s omnibus voting law targeted blacks “with almost surgical precision.”“Changing our state’s election laws close to the upcoming election, including common sense voter ID, will create confusion for voters and poll workers,” McCrory said in a statement, adding that he expects to file an emergency petition with the Supreme Court “by early next week.”On Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit refused to put on hold its earlier ruling, which made waves for decreeing that the state’s legislature had passed “the most restrictive voting law North Carolina has seen since the era of Jim Crow” ― and found that lawmakers acted with the intent to disenfranchise African-American voters.To remedy those violations, the court enjoined the law in full, ordering the restoration of early voting, out-of-precinct voting and same-day registration, as well as non-enforcement of the voter ID provision. In response, the state reassured the appeals court that it had the means to comply with the ruling ahead of the election.“Because of these assurances, we are confident that North Carolina can conduct the 2016 election in compliance with our injunction,” the appeals court said in its follow-up order on Thursday.But McCrory didn’t seem convinced, insisting that allowing last week’s ruling to take effect does a disservice to North Carolina.“The court should have stayed their ruling, which is legally flawed, factually wrong, and disparaging to our state,” he said in his statement.It is unlikely that McCrory will fare much better at the Supreme Court. Under its rules, he would need to convince five justices that he has a strong enough case to merit an order allowing North Carolina to once again enforce its multiple voting restrictions.As the 4th Circuit explained on Thursday, the justices themselves may be reluctant to intervene given the conflict contrary orders may cause for poll workers and voters so close to the election.“Court orders affecting elections, especially conflicting orders, can themselves result in voter confusion and consequent incentive to remain away from the polls,” the court said, quoting from a 2006 Supreme Court case. “As an election draws closer, that risk will increase.”"
