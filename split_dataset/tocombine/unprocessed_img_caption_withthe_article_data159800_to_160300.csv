And threats to coral are only expected to intensify as a result of climate change and ocean acidification due to greenhouse gases.

That damages hard corals, tiny animals that secrete calcium carbonate to form their stony protective layer.""When combined with their ability for rapid colonisation, soft corals may out compete hard corals in coral reef environments subject to ocean acidification,"" the scientists wrote. CLOWNFISH""Hard corals are important reef builders and provide complex three-dimensional habitats for many reef organisms,"" they wrote, adding that a shift could have damaging effects for many fish and other marine creatures that live around reefs.A community of soft coral ""hardly works like hard coral as a nest for small living organism such as ... shrimp, and little fish,"" Inoue said. The 2003 animated movie ""Saving Nemo"" shows how clownfish live and grow around reefs.Covering less than one percent of the ocean floor, reefs support about 25 percent of all marine life, with over 4,000 species of fish alone, according to the International Coral Reef Initiative which seeks to protect reefs.The scientists said that the levels of carbon dioxide in the water off Iwotorishima, an island near Okinawa in the Pacific, corresponded varied from equivalent to 550 parts per million (ppm) of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere to as high as 970. Both levels are within the range seen as possible by 2100 according to the U.N. panel of climate scientists.Current atmospheric levels are about 395 ppm, a sharp rise from 280 ppm before the Industrial Revolution. And emissions of carbon dioxide are continuing to rise - China, the United States and the European Union are the top emitters.Other studies have also shown that stony coral reefs are vulnerable to rises in temperature that can cause a whitening that can lead to death.Gas vents in the Mediterranean and corals around a carbon dioxide seep off Papua New Guinea have also been used to study the likely future conditions of the oceans.""Soft coral may not always be the winner in acidified waters. In temperate oceans, it has been shown that algae or sea anemones can be winners at high-carbon dioxide vents,"" they wrote. (Reporting by Alister Doyle; Editing by Jason webb)"

5,SPORTS,Honoring the 30-Year Anniversary of Jimmy V and the Wolfpack's Improbable Ride,"James Campion, Contributor
Editor and Chief - Reality Check News & information Desk",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jimmy-v_us_5bb6d50de4b097869fd3218b,"The 1983 North Carolina Wolfpack created March Madness, coming from nowhere to win nine consecutive elimination games over a month period against a field of mostly heavily favored opponents.",2013-03-24,"18 Jan 1988: Vinnie Del Negro of the North Carolina State Wolfpack poses with coach Jim Valvano at Reynolds Coliseum in Raleigh, North Carolina. Mandatory Credit: Allsport /Allsport",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6d50d2100002501c8d25e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With the commencement of the Men's NCAA Basketball Tournament, arguably the most watched American sporting event outside of the Super Bowl, it is time to mark the 30-year anniversary of one of the most impossible runs in sports history. The 1983 North Carolina Wolfpack created March Madness, coming from nowhere to win nine consecutive elimination games over a month period against a field of mostly heavily favored opponents with rosters bulging with future NBA superstars. In seven of those victories, State came from behind in the final minutes on the way to defining in almost every way possible the very essence of the term underdog.Seems like five minutes ago, but it was another era. Before the three-point line, before the shot-clock and long before the best players in the game skipped to the pros after one season (and for a time, ala Lebron James, skipped college all-together), here was this team that won game after game, overcoming ridiculous odds in one bizarre event after another.It was also before every office had a pool and everyone you knew was filling out brackets and every sponsor clamored for a chance to be associated with the timeless joy of amateur athletes from across the nation sprinting to beat the buzzer. Hell, some of the early round games in 1983 were on tape delay. Sure, a few years before it was Bird vs. Magic, but that attained its legendary status when both men and their teams revived the NBA during its most enduring mano-a-mano rivalry. And, of course, it wasn't as if there had never been upsets in college basketball, but the '83 Wolfpack was one for the ages. There has quite simply never been nor has there ever been since a college team so completely over-matched, so irrevocably poised, so damned exciting as N.C. State winning game after game in such a concentrated period of time.Instead of one enduring upset in a 40 or 60 minute contest; Villanova's incredible upending of the mighty Georgetown in the 1985 NCAA Finals or say the New York Giants improbable defeat of the undefeated New England Patriots in Super Bowl XLII, consider one solid month of upsets -- nine in a row.To put into perspective, only three other upsets in American sports trump what the Wolfpack achieved in 1983; the 1980 USA Hockey team, The 1968 N.Y. Jets and Buster Douglas taking down Mike Tyson. You know, the type of Hollywood-esque fluff that transforms a century's worth of sports clichés (destiny, momentum and clutch) into pure magic.The grand wizard of this run, State's coach, an Italian motor-mouth from New York City named Jim Valvano, showed up on Tobacco Road three years earlier and began having his kids practice cutting the gym nets down in mock victory ceremonies every week. The players thought him mad. It was silly. Who does this? However, slowly but surely, Valvano was teaching his team more than basketball. He was teaching them to dream; to visualize hope and expect the impossible. He was corny. He was goofy. He was the perfect lunatic for a collection of kids who bought into the Disney tripe that takes a pedestrian 17-10 record (the second most losses to win an NCAA title) and sweeps it through an ACC Tournament loaded with talent, wins and trophies.Due to its poor record, a symptom of injuries and inner turmoil, all N.C. State had to do was win the damn thing just to qualify for the Big Dance. Along the way, this meant besting defending champion North Carolina with three starters destined for the pros, including arguably the greatest player in the game's history, Michael Jordan, and a Virginia team with the best player in the conference, the 7'4"" monster, Ralph Samson. Both teams, along with Wake Forest, whom State beat to earn a shot at these titans, had dismantled them during the regular season. And in each game the opponent had a lead late or in overtime, and yet could not halt the hoping and dreaming.During the North Carolina game, Valvano was faced with a six-point deficit (no three-point line or shot-clock) against Dean Smith's heralded and roundly mocked four-corner offense, in which the team passed the ball around half court for up to five minutes to kill the clock and end the game. So he decided to begin fouling. And as State fouled, North Carolina kept missing subsequent foul shots. State won. This tactic would readily assist the dreamers during their spectacular NCAA Tournament run to come.Leading up the championship game against the heavily favored Houston Cougars, the nation's baddest squad, nicknamed Phi Slama Jama due to the parade of high-flying dunks the 31-2 team rained down on its shell-shocked opponents, Valvano continued the ""foul"" strategy. To put pressure on opponents, State even fouled a player during a tied game late in one of the semi-final rounds. The other strategy Valvano instituted was using his media-savvy, wise-guy persona to genuflect to Houston's greatness in press conferences and television appearances, telling anyone who would listen that he would slow the game down so much it would bore the nation, but in a rousing pre-game locker room speech witnesses claim was worthy of Knute Rockne, Valvano told his team to take it right at the likes of future Hall of Famers Hakeem Olajuwon and Clyde Drexler. State did, building a seven-point halftime lead, which evaporated in the opening five minutes of the second half as Houston powered to its own eight-point bulge.Then Valvano started putting Houston on the foul line and Houston began missing. N.C. State, having won the craziest, most gut-wrenching contests just to get this point, would drag the Mighty Phi Slama Jama into its web of dreams. Miraculously, the team's poise and Valvano's scheming took the entire run, the entire season, down to the final seconds tied at 52-52. Once again State held back and let Houston pass the ball around the perimeter until it came to Alvin Franklin, a freshman guard with the least experience of the invincible Cougars. Then Valvano, running like a banshee up the sideline, screamed for someone to foul him.Years later, when my family had moved to North Carolina in the mid-eighties and my brother went to N.C. State (like Valvano, by way of Iona) and my dad became a season ticket holder, whenever I would visit we could not help but remember watching this moment unfold back in New Jersey. How we coached right along with the crazy Italian, who asked a fair basketball team to be great again and again, and for good measure, one more time.And, of course, the freshman missed the front end of a one-on-one, and now it was State's turn to hold for the final shot; for all the marbles, this one-game-and-done waltz for over a month coming down to 44 seconds; tie game, destiny, dreaming, hope and visualization all right there.And everyone who knows basketball history, that knows about this March Madness business, and how it got started, with a riveted nation and the kids against the men and the impossible becoming reality, knows what happened: Shooting guard, Dereck Whittenburg heaved a prayer with five seconds left from nearly half quart and center Lorenzo Charles sidestepped the mighty Olajuwon, whose nickname was poetically, The Dream, caught the thing in mid-air and dunked it home at the buzzer.Pandemonium.Championship.Valvano running around the court looking for someone to hug.March Madness forever more."

8,WELLNESS,Cultivating Equanimity Through Adversity: What I Wish I Could Teach My Family,"Lauren Cahn, Contributor
Small girl, LARGE opinions",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/handling-adversity_us_5b9cf2fae4b03a1dcc833562,"I didn't choose to cultivate equanimity.  It chose me.  My experience has taught me that nothing is permanent. Change is inevitable; sometimes it brings pleasure, sometimes pain.  While you can't avoid pain, you can choose to suffer less.",2013-03-23,A loving father with a young daughter on his shoulders while holding the other's hand on the beach,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf2fa2200008300d97060.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Woody Allen once said that the most beautiful words in the English language are not ""I love you"" but ""It's benign."" I'm not sure I agree, but then, I have had only limited experience gazing into the eyes of a doctor and hoping for those two words that every neurotic longs to hear.The one time it came up, the doctor's words were far from beautiful. ""It's cancer,"" he said of the lump I had found in my right breast while showering one sunny August morning in 2002. I was 36. Although the cancer was aggressive, and my two years of treatment make the trials of Odysseus seem like a playground tussle, I am still alive nearly 11 years later.My dad heard his ""ugly"" words 15 years ago, when at age 55 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. He survived. Eight years ago, the words were uttered again. This time, it was an aggressive form of lung cancer that was inoperable and had already spread to his lymph nodes. Miraculously, my dad responded to treatment, and the cancer remained in remission for eight years. But you've seen enough horror films to know what happens next: Bad guy is down, his body riddled with bullets. He's gotta be dead. But wait, is he... is he moving? Is? He? Still? Alive?During the fall, my mom expressed her concern to me that my dad seemed to be getting lost on the way to places where he had been hundreds of times before. He was also tired and irritable. Then one day in February, he woke up unable to swallow. By the end of that day, we learned that the ugliest words in the English language may very well be: ""Your cancer is back -- this time it's in your brain."" Nevertheless, the cancer was operable, and Dad made it through his craniotomy with flying colors. But a few days later, he suffered a seizure, an ominous sign of the cancer's murderous intent. And with the seizure came a change in my father. He was no longer who he had been before. Once a voracious eater, now his appetite is poor. He sleeps most of the time. When he's awake, he sometimes doesn't know where he is. After reading an article about Thailand, he believed that he had just returned from vacationing there. He was briefly obsessed with buying a new car even though he can no longer drive. He can barely walk. At times, he's hostile (""someone needs to kick you right in the gut""). At times he acts like a young child (pulling the covers up over his head to signal that it's time for me to leave). I'd love to say that with 15 years of experience fighting cancer, my family approaches my father's illness with equanimity. I'd love to say that we've come together like a well-oiled machine, steadfastly supporting one another as we face this ordeal.Unfortunately, the reality is something else entirely. My mom is sleep-deprived and highly reactive. When my dad has a good day, the treatment must be working. A bad day means that death must be imminent. On a Tuesday, my mom may fume over a doctor's neglect, despite that on Monday she was seething over what she felt was intrusive care. Learning that a doctor attended Harvard is cause for jubilation, until the doctor takes too long to respond to an email. Mostly, my mother seems furious -- and with good reason -- seemingly overnight her husband has become her charge, and how can anyone begin to know the pain she is feeling? To my younger sister's credit, I believe that she has come as close as anyone can in helping my mom feel less alone in her anguish. Although my sister has a high-level job 45 miles from her house, her house is a mere five miles from my parents' -- and my sister has been physically present for my mom nearly daily since this ordeal began. That physical presence has been an invaluable source of comfort to my mom. I know this just clearly as I know that my own relative lack of physical presence has been a source of anger.Why can't I be there, they have asked me, given that I don't work outside the home (which is solely their opinion, by the way)? The short answer is that I live nearly two hours away from my parents, I have two teenage boys who play on sports teams, no carpool prospects (not for not trying) and a husband who's rarely home during the week. The inevitable follow-up question is: Why not hire a car service to drive my kids around? That I feel obligated to answer such boundaries-breaking questions is disconcerting to me. But here goes: My boys suffered terribly as a result of my cancer. I honestly believe that they have largely recovered from their abandonment wounds. But I also believe that the wounds left scars. I can't erase the pain of the past, and I can't alter the course of the future. But I candecide that at this time, while my father is sick but still in treatment and not without hope, I am not comfortable dumping my boys several times a week over an indefinite period.My mom resents this, as do my sister and her husband, who just so happen to have structured their lives so that one of them (my sister's husband) is always home and available for their 8-year-old son. Their disapproval of my choices is registered both publicly and privately. But it's not only my parenting choices that are under attack. During the three weeks (a total of 12 performances) when I stage-managed an off-off-Broadway play, the accusatory question shifted briefly to, ""Why is this job more important than your dad?"" When I hosted a fundraiser for the play (which I had committed to doing well before my dad became sick), I was publicly shamed for having ""fiddled while Rome burned."" When I was recently down with a cold, I was accused of being happy to have been quarantined from visiting. When I created a fundraising page for the charity for whom I am keynote speaking in April, I was accused of spending all day on Facebook instead of visiting my dad. When I posted professional headshots taken well before my dad became sick (in connection with the same charity), I was accused of spending all day taking photos of myself.   Over and over again, and in all manner of contradictory fashion, I am accused of not caring. It's not that I don't care. I care deeply. If caring were measured in the damage done to one's fingernails, no one would question me. I have bitten my fingernails until nothing is left except cuticles, and then I've bitten my cuticles. I am pained by the notion that the man who taught me to think like a lawyer and took me shopping for my prom dress might be gone soon, and that in a sense, he already is. And I am pained by the unavoidable connection between my father's illness and my own frailty.Two years after my double mastectomy, my surgeon congratulated me for surviving past the point where ""most women have a recurrence."" At three years, I got the same exact speech. At seven and 10 years, I heard it again. Huh. I've tried to avoid thinking about what that might mean. Then last year my oncologist mentioned that breast cancer can recur even 20 years later. Still, I tried not to think about it. But when my dad's lung cancer spread to his brain after eight years, how could I not think about it? There it was, springing up like some sinister jack-in-the-box at the most inopportune of times -- when I am alone in the car on my way to see Dad, or when I'm sitting in the chair beside his bed, hoping he doesn't get irritated with me for talking too fast.Yoga, once my primary form of exercise, is now fraught with issues because it is deeply connected for me with cancer survival. I began yoga while I was in treatment, and I always believed it helped make me well. But now I'm skeptical. How dare I imagine that yoga could possibly matter when actual medical science didn't matter for my dad? But this isn't about me. The fact is that my dad is gravely ill, and we as a family are not handling it well. I am not willing to compromise my parenting values at this time. I cannot take away my mother's suffering by suffering on her behalf, and I can't take away anyone's suffering by absorbing their verbal attacks. But still, I want to offer my support in any way I can. And what I do have to offer is a what I have learned about accepting major adversity with equanimity. Cultivating equanimity does not mean denying feelings. It means making choices about how to react to those feelings. Having gone from vibrant at 35 to halfway dead at 36, having shown up for chemo only to be told to go home because I was too anemic, having just gotten used to wearing my wig when my eyelashes and eyebrows suddenly fell out, having celebrated my last day of chemo only to be checked into an isolation tank because the chemo had destroyed my immune system -- how could I help but cultivate some level of distance between experience and reaction? I didn't choose to cultivate equanimity. It chose me. My experience has taught me that nothing is permanent. Change is inevitable; sometimes it brings pleasure, sometimes pain. While you can't avoid pain, you can choose to suffer less.Choosing to suffer less does not equal choosing to not care. It means expecting both bad days and good days, in no particular order. It means accepting a new and truly awful normal. I don't have to like it. But failing to accept it is tantamount to trying to control an unstoppable force. It is doomed to fail, and you will get crushed in the process. I'd like to say that I would recommend this approach to anyone dealing with adversity. But the truth is, in some cases -- in my case -- it seems to alienate those who are still riding the roller coaster. My unwillingness (or inability) to stomach the curves and drops isolates me from my family, even as it protects me. If I could teach my family to cultivate some level of distance between their experience and how they react to it, I would. They wouldn't hurt any less. But I truly believe that there would be far less suffering. For more by Lauren Cahn, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."
9,WELLNESS,10 Tips to Ease Performance Anxiety,"Vivian Diller, Ph.D., Contributor

But you may be among the millions who privately struggle with the jitters before speaking in public. Does your face redden, your heart pound or your mind go blank when you toast at a wedding? When you present work to your clients or raise your hand to ask or answer a question, do you get dizzy, even feel as if you might faint? There are people who experience extreme physical and psychological distress before speaking in public. Some worry for weeks, even months in advance. Others suffer full blown panic attacks at the mere thought of taking center stage. While you may assume performance anxiety is relatively rare, it's actually one of the most commonly reported symptoms among all social fears. According to a recent Gallup poll, about 40 percent of all adults in the U.S suffer from some degree of stage fright.My work leads me to speak regularly in public -- on radio, television and in front of live audiences -- and like many, I've had my fair share of jitters. Those who know me are surprised, since I've been a performer most my life. I danced professionally until my early 20s and after that I modeled and acted in TV commercials. In fact, during those performances, I rarely felt much anxiety. As a ballerina everything was choreographed and rehearsed with little left to serendipity. As a model, there's not much to worry about after stylists finish with your hair, makeup and clothes. Even acting in commercials requires little spontaneity, with the copy memorized and a director managing every precious second. Besides, if you messed up, there was always another take!Everyday public speaking is different. The scripts are our own, and we don't usually get second or third takes. Moreover, our audiences are often people we know. Whether it is a hall-full of professional peers, a class-full of students or a table-full of dinner guests, stepping out on the stages of daily life can create much more vulnerability and therefore, anxiety.Below are some tips that have reliably eased my own fears. They are based on cognitive behavior therapy, one of several methods psychologists use to treat performance anxiety (desensitization and medication being among others). CBT helps people understand their reactions to anxiety and provides ways to gain control over it. Here are 10 tips that I have found most helpful while speaking in public.   1) Normalize your nervousness: Many people assume other speakers have an easier time, but the truth is, almost everyone feels a certain amount of stage fright. Have you noticed how many hands tremble and voices quiver as actors accept their awards? (Lawrence Olivier and Paul Newman are two who have admitted to being almost paralyzed by live appearances.) The intensity of anxiety is not a good indicator of how your talk is actually perceived. Once you get started, the jitters tend to go away -- often in less than a minute, even if it feels longer -- and rarely impact your speech. 2) Minimize the anticipation: The greatest discomfort for most people is waiting for their moment in the spotlight. We call this anticipatory anxiety. The key to staying calm is not getting nervous about feeling nervous. Once the ""fight or flight"" reaction starts, it is tough to shut it down. Find reliable ways to distract yourself in the days and hours before your speech. Right before you speak, take deep steady breaths to slow down the adrenaline rush. Short-term meditation also works.  3) Productive preparation: While distraction helps avoid anticipatory anxiety, investing time in rehearsing is necessary. Practice your speech in front of a mirror. Go over your opening lines -- even memorize them -- so that you don't have to think about how you'll begin. Performance anxiety is often most palpable at the beginning of a speech. If your first few sentences feel hard wired into your brain, they can be said as if on autopilot. Preparing your opening this way will likely lower the risk for continued anxiety. 4) Know your environment: Familiarize yourself with the venue where your speech will be given so you are comfortable when the time comes to speak. It's why there is often a lighting and sound check before keynote addresses. Go to your convention hall, stand up at the podium or use your imagination to envision yourself in these settings. Finding a balance between controlling as much as you can, while recognizing there will be some things you can't control, is key to not letting your nerves interfere. 5) Wait for quiet: If there is applause as you start your speech, pause while it dies down. It's another way to take control, conveying that you are in charge of when you will begin. Use those moments to breathe, smile, look around the room and nod your head as if to say, ""thank you."" You can look as if you are taking it all in, but meanwhile, it gives you a couple of seconds to collect your thoughts. 6) Make the start easy: There are introductions that typically precede speeches. ""We'd like to welcome our guest of honor,"" or ""let's move to our next presenter,"" are common ones. Practice your opening lines with an intro in mind, so when you hear it, you aren't taken by surprise. Then start with a simple acknowledgement of your MC or your audience, with something as banal as ""thank you for the kind words,"" or ""thank you all for joining me tonight."" This gives you additional time to calm down your nerves and gets things going smoothly. 7) Break the ice: When possible, it's great to start presentations with an anecdote that breaks the ice. Depending upon your audience, a personal story works well. If you can make a joke out of your jitters, that works too. By the time you start talking about the content, the fears often dissipate. One speaker I heard said, ""I was up all night thinking about what I wanted to say today, but the words flew out of my mind,"" People nodded, as if knowing exactly what he meant and within moments his wandering words returned.  8) Take charge: Some people say, ""imagine your audience naked,"" as a way to keep calm. It's meant to make the audience seem more vulnerable and to disarm the power they are perceived to have. But I find there are better ways to feel in charge. Vulnerability results from the fear of being humiliated or losing control. Recognize that neither is likely. Control comes from the proper mind set (which is what these tips provide) and good preparation. If you have rehearsed well, assume that one sentence will follow the other until your confidence gains traction. The truth is, most often people want to hear what you have to say and are eager to like you. Envision acceptance in their eyes, rather than the potential for criticism.   9) Connect to your listeners: Some find it helpful to make eye contact with people they know in the audience -- mates, kids or friends -- while others find comfort in anonymity. Whatever relaxes you is fine, but remember to speak as if you are having a conversation. Talk 'to' your listeners, not 'at' them. Find kind, smiling faces to encourage you on and connect with as many as possible. Even if your speech doesn't go as well as you would like, people will remember and appreciate your connection to them. 10) Use a cheat sheet: Take a piece of paper and write down your main talking points and the people you want to remember to thank. Hold it in your hand or put it in your pocket. Keep in mind that if you forget to mention an idea or two, or even if you leave out someone's name, it rarely matters in the long run. But having those bullet points available will keep you feeling calmer. Props can sometimes help calm nerves even if you don't use them.My practice is filled with performers whose jobs are all about taking center stage -- professional actors, athletes, news anchors and CEOs -- but I also work with everyday people who are asked to speak in front of audiences. Some talk about debilitating panic -- the kind that put golfer Charlie Beljan in the hospital. Others feel milder forms of anxiety and have learned to accept that jitters are just part of the performing experience. Unless you perform regularly, being in the spotlight is very challenging. If you expect it to be -- and prepare yourself using these tips -- then you may get through your performance with less wear and tear. When it's over you may end up thinking that you managed to pull it off rather well in spite of your fears. And if you do, the next time will be a lot easier.How do you deal with being in the spotlight? Share tips that you find helpful.

As a writer (often about food) living in New York, I'm lucky enough to experience many culinary discoveries and mind blowing meals. However, this recent stretch of foodie fortune was largely spent outside of the city, with a visit to Washington D.C., a mini-vacation in New Orleans and a wine and cheese party at my apartment in between. I've worked in restaurants and eaten at many of them, from truck stops in India to tasting menus here in New York. I fall asleep reading food magazines and dream of what I'll cook next. From performing violin at my parents dinner parties to hosting elaborate brunches in my studio, entertaining is in my blood. Whether it's your birthday, half birthday, or parents anniversary, I'll make a cake, always from scratch. Here are the most terrific dishes I tasted from New York to New Orleans.#1 Chicken and Waffles with house cured bacon & hot sauce butter. (Evening Star Café, Alexandria VA) After noshing on decent (but far from great) Chinese food for dinner, a tasty afternoon repast was a high priority. Avoiding the mayhem of D.C. brunch, we ventured to quaint Alexandria for some rib-stickin breakfast goods. While all of our dishes were great, my brother hit the jackpot with the Chicken and Waffles. Marinated in buttermilk, the chicken was moist and tender, encased in a sheath of beautifully browned crunchy crispiness. With a slathering of hot sauce butter and a bite of chewy waffle, it did the dish's tradition proud. #2 Carrot, Orange Mint and BBQ Lamb Seasonal Jar with Homemade Crackers (Lincoln, Washington, D.C.) Lincoln specializes in that ever-original concept ""seasonal small plates."" We ordered a wide array of things, including crab hushpuppies and deviled eggs which arrived on a chicken-shaped egg scale. The seasonal jar, with its unique flavors and colorful presentation, was the clear winner. As we scooped from top to bottom of the Mason jar, spreading the contents on crackers, the herbal note of the mint, bright sweetness of the puréed carrots and rich, flavorful lamb worked perfectly; entrée flavors translated into a compact appetizer.#3. A Glass of Some Sort of White Wine (My Apartment, New York, NY) I've been raised to know that entertaining really means excess. I take this very seriously, especially when cramming 20+ people into my studio apartment with bottles of wine on all surfaces and enough cheese to rival most Parisian fromagiers. I wish I could be more specific about the glass of wine, but I know only that it was accompanied by a deep exhale, after my baked brie exited the oven, charcuterie and salads were on the table and the apartment cleaned. A close second were the pâté sandwiches I was eating for three days after the party.#4. Tall Boys & Beignets (Café Beignet, New Orleans, LA) Undoubtedly, deep fried dough and a dearth of open container laws are two of the best things about New Orleans. A warm afternoon enjoying jazz, beer and beignets in a French Quarter courtyard was a delightful start to the weekend. Steam emanated from the piping hot beignets and powdered sugar stuck to our hands, faces and belongings. Although warm from being toted around, my Miller HighLife tallboy only added to the experience.#5. Roasted Broccoli & Green Bean Salad w/ BBQ Pecans and Poblano Ranch (Cochon, New Orleans, LA) It seems sacrilege to select a vegetable dish as my favorite at a meal comprised largely of pork products at a restaurant named ""Cochon."" But this dish was unbelievably tasty, with the creamy-spicy poblano ranch coating the crunchy broccoli and springy green beans. It was the first dish we got, and I fought to keep it on the table, even after I'd scraped up every last bit of sauce and BBQ pecan crumbs.#6. Crawfish (Lucy's Retired Surfer Bar & Restaurant, New Orleans, LA) Although I'd pre-planned most of our dining, this taste was something we simply happened upon. Parking the car, we encountered a crawfish boil, and after chatting with the chefs in charge (and photographing the process), we sat down, cracked open some crawfish tails, and dug in to the flavorful and succulent meat. Nawlins at its finest.#7. Pickled Shrimp & Deviled Eggs (Root, New Orleans, LA) This was my third incidence of deviled eggs in one week, both at Lincoln in Washington and in a gumbo at Cochon. However, this dish trumped the others. The shrimp were pickled to tangy-sweet succulent perfection. The eggs were stuffed with chopped shrimp and topped with truffled egg yolk mousse, perfectly tying the two components together. While I'd be remiss if I didn't mention other amazing parts of the meal--including smoky scallops that arrived in a re-fashioned cigar box and housemade duck prosciutto with pickled Brussels sprouts and strawberries--the eggs and shrimp were the ideal end to two weeks of Southern goodness."

Problems in the family,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf1fc24000051005364fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Therapists are always reminding parents to talk to their children. Unfortunately, many parents need just such a reminder -- especially in today's mega-paced culture in which just sitting down to a family dinner together seems to be a major accomplishment. Too often, busy parents find themselves talking ""at"" their children, but not ""to"" them. And most especially, not ""with"" them.This, of course, is problematic in any family trying to raise socially, emotionally and spiritually healthy children. However, it is especially dangerous if that family is facing the challenges of divorce or separation. If your parent-child communication skills and rapport is not optimal before discussions about divorce or family lifestyle changes come up, the likeliness of a peaceful, successful outcome is dramatically jeopardized.For that reason, more than ever before, parents need to create a bond of trust and support with their children when the family is facing any level of upheaval. If that respectful bond and trust is broken or tenuous, children are much more likely to feel abandoned, neglected and fearful about their safety and security in the face of separation of any kind.However, it is never too late to bridge that gap and start authentic communication with your children. Honesty is always important in any parent-child relationship, but it becomes extremely significant at this time.Of course, all communication must be age-appropriate. And these talks are never a license for a dumping session about your soon-to-be ex or former spouse. Whining, complaining, sarcasm, disrespect and related behaviors are not healthy forms of communication, especially with sensitive children. They don't want you to air your dirty laundry with them. They want to feel safe, loved, secure and supported as they move into a transition in life that they did not desire or create. Insulting or criticizing their other parent affects them to their core. Your children are innocent and many parents need to remind themselves of this fact again and again.There has never been a better time than now to boost your level of communication with your children, regardless of your marital status. Share some of your own feelings and experiences with life's challenges before you start asking them questions about their life. Knowing that you personally deal with fears, anxieties, doubts and related emotions gives your children permission to talk about those they are experiencing. It makes them feel more okay about their own insecurities. And it encourages them to talk more frankly with you about challenges they face in all facets of their life.Don't wait for a special occasion to start honestly and candidly talking to your children. Determine to make sincere communication with your children a regular part of your family life. You will never regret it and you will come to reap surprising rewards in the months and years ahead!* * * *Rosalind Sedacca, CCT is author of How Do I Tell the Kids about the Divorce?

12,WELLNESS,Healthy Breakfast Tips: Avoid These Morning Mistakes,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/healthy-breakfast-mistakes_us_5b9ceecfe4b03a1dcc830d34,"Many of my patients admit to skipping breakfast with this excuse: Whenever they eat in the mornings, they wind up feeling",2013-03-23,Close-up of green bowl in cereal and blueberries with spoon.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ceecf1f00002c00216b31.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Keri Gans for U.S. News HealthMany of my patients admit to skipping breakfast with this excuse: Whenever they eat in the mornings, they wind up feeling much hungrier than if they hadn't eaten at all. Sound familiar? My nutrition intuition tells me that they're not feeling hungry because they ate breakfast, but rather, because they ate the wrong breakfast. In my years working with patients, I've found that for some people with good intentions, there seems to be a disconnect with what they consider a healthy breakfast.More from U.S. News Health: Stop the Excuses: Eat Breakfast How to Serve Dinner for Breakfast How and Why to Become a Morning PersonHere are the most common breakfast mistakes I've seen:Not Enough Protein Many of my patients have a bowl of cereal with milk for their breakfasts. Seems like a good choice, right? Yes, one cup of milk provides eight grams of protein, but think about it: How often do slurp down all the milk that accompanies our cereal? Not often, I would guess. Protein digests more slowly than carbohydrates, so without ample amounts, you'll be hungry sooner rather than later. If you don't want to drink the milk from the bowl, add a hard-boiled egg to your meal for extra protein. You can also consume protein via 100 percent whole-grain toast, and when you do, don't top it with just a tiny smear of peanut or almond butter. Enjoy the full serving of nut butter with your toast to get more protein.Too Little Fiber The more sugar in your breakfast cereal, the faster it digests, and the hungrier you'll be. Conversely, more fiber will keep you fuller longer. So, here's my rule of thumb for cereal: There should always be at least five grams of fiber, and there should always be more fiber than sugar. For extra fiber, add chia or flax seeds. If you choose the latter, make sure to grind the seeds first, or else you won't absorb their nutritional benefits.No Fat A meal with no fat can make you hungry again within an hour. Let's look at the supposed healthy breakfast of non-fat Greek yogurt, high-fiber cereal and berries. Where's the fat? I tell my patients to either switch to 2 percent-fat yogurt or to add some nuts to prevent feeling hungry. However, whenever I mention adding fat, I want to drive home the point that more isn't better. A little fat goes a long way.Not Enough Food While a piece of fruit is rich in fiber, vitamins and minerals, it's not enough for breakfast. Many of my patients have found that a grab-and-go breakfast -- like an apple on the drive to work -- simply doesn't cut it. However, if they sit down and mindfully consume about 300 to 400 calories, they feel way more satisfied. By the time lunch approaches, those extra calories are no longer relevant, and have likely kept them from a day of overeating.Too Late In The Day I usually recommend eating within an hour of waking, if possible. The longer a person waits to eat breakfast, the hungrier they usually become, making it harder to be satisfied once they eat. Remember: One of a breakfast's main purposes is to provide you with fuel after a long break from eating. Once your breakfast blurs with the lines of lunchtime, it no longer does its job efficiently.Bottom line. If you want your breakfast to keep you satisfied, let's try and keep the mistakes to a minimum. But remember: Any breakfast is better than no breakfast."

According to the National Association of Realtors, existing home sales have risen and distressed mortgages account for a smaller part of those sales. Close to a million home loans in the United States were in some stage of the foreclosure process in early 2011. More than half a decade after the start of the housing crisis, that number has started to decline, but there were still nearly 750,000 homes in the foreclosure process as of last month.A small number of banks serviced or acted as trustee in the vast majority of the mortgages in foreclosure — and it is the same banks that now find themselves having to deal with those mortgages and deflated property values. As of February, Bank of America was servicing more than 95,000 loans in foreclosure, followed by Wells Fargo, which was servicing 85,000 loans. Based on RealtyTrac’s February 2013 data, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 10 banks foreclosing the most homes.Click Here To See 10 Banks Foreclosing On The Most Homes The banks foreclosing on the most homes may not directly own the bulk of the mortgages. Rather, they often service them for other entities, which means collecting payments from homeowners and foreclosing on those properties when they become delinquent. In other cases banks act as a trustee, representing a pool of mortgage loans held in a trust.As of 2012, according to Mortgage Daily, the banks foreclosing on the most mortgages — Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Chase — were the three biggest servicers of all mortgages.According to RealtyTrac’s Vice President Daren Blomquist, the majority of loans originated prior to the recession. The banks that actually own the loans, Blomquist explained, are now stuck with these mortgages in foreclosure. Bank of America in particular is struggling to unload the assets it absorbed through its acquisition of Countrywide Financial.Despite not being directly on the hook for the majority of the losses incurred when a home enters foreclosure, these servicing banks still stand to lose money, both from the lost fees they would have collected with each mortgage payment and the costs they have to incur to deal with the foreclosure. “All things being equal” Blomquist explained “they would prefer to have that as a performing mortgage, rather than as a non-performing mortgage, because they’re actually generating income as opposed to not.”According to Sam Garcia, founder and publisher of Mortgage Daily, many of these banks have had to contract companies that specialize as servicers for distressed mortgages to work with borrowers that are delinquent or going through the foreclosure process. “It doesn’t really cost anything to service a loan that’s being paid on time,” Garcia said. However, “Once you have to start talking to the customer, that loan becomes unprofitable.”To determine the 10 banks foreclosing the most home loans, 24/7 Wall St reviewed data provided by RealtyTrac, an online real estate marketplace and data source on distressed homes properties. All data are as of February 2013 and reflect the amount and value of both homes and mortgages serviced or held in trust by the nation’s major banks. At RealtyTrac’s suggestion, because Bank of America acquired Countrywide’s assets and liabilities in 2008, we treated loans in foreclosure that were serviced or held in trust by Countrywide as part of Bank of America’s portfolio. RealtyTrac also tracks the percentage of foreclosed properties it considers to be “seriously underwater” — defined as having a loan-to-value ratio of at least 125%. Additional data on the total amount of mortgage loans originated in 2012 and the size of the mortgage portfolio serviced or held in trust by banks as of December 31, 2012, come from Mortgage Daily. Here are the 10 banks that are foreclosing on the most homes, according to 24/7 Wall St.:"

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) responded by saying that Holder's confession is further evidence that big banks should have greater accountability. (Hat tip: American Banker.)"

(Please see New York Times, ""JP Morgan Board Confirms Dual Role For Dimon."")This not only in the face of the huge failure, as detailed in the 301-page Senate report, but also in its intransigent dismissal of a wide gathering of shareholders demanding separation of the chairman and executive posts, including the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees as well the pension funds of New York and Connecticut who filed resolutions to separate the two executive posts.And why not? Being on the board of JPMorgan Chase is a happy club-like sinecure, well compensated and without much risk of being held to account. One can well presume that each of the board members has the comfort of knowing they are the beneficiaries of a board of director's liability insurance policy holding them virtually harmless for any decisions, no matter how it might impact other shareholders. And, of course, the insurance would be bought, paid for and expensed by the mother ship, JPMorgan Chase.In doing so the board is abetting a culture of risk taking that is placing our entire banking system in danger, all the while countenancing the indiscriminate and unregulated bank's gambling on such a wide array of traded derivatives ranging from credit, to oil and petroleum products, grain staples such as wheat and corn, and base metals such as copper and rare earths. The list goes on and on, while placing at risk depositor monies guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and access to near limitless funding at near zero interest from the Fed window, not to speak of their impact on the upward and costly distortion of prices ranging from gasoline to food stuffs. (Please see ""Jamie Dimon's Malign Influence On The Culture Of American Banking."")Oh yes, there was the slap on the wrist this past January when J.P.Morgan's board cut Mr. Dimon's compensation in the wake of the London Whale imbroglio from $23.1 million to a mere $11.5 million. This was after the London Whale's hiccup of more than $6.2 billion (what we know of presently). Not a bad trade off if you can get it, and Mr. Dimon still doesn't have to take the subway. Oh, by the way, the decision to cut Mr. Dimon's salary came after a series of marathon meetings led by none other than Lee R. Raymond, the former CEO of Exxon Mobil who heads the boards compensation committee. In Mr. Raymond, Mr. Dimon and JPMorgan Chase have an expert in executive compensation to look after their interests. He knows how to get things done having pocketed some $400,000,000 as his goodbye handshake from Exxon Mobil.

Woodkid's ""The Golden Age"" contained a few capturing moments, but the the listening experience wasn't consistent. And Karl Bartos failed to impress with ""Off The Record,"" an album that seemed to only pay homage to his electro pop hits of the past.With a ridiculous amount of pointless violence and a second half that was visually jarring for some viewers, ""Olympus Has Fallen"" received some of the worst reviews this week.

Oh I know. We reside in a patriarchal, plantational world. A world where despite a (black) woman's achievements, she cannot say or sing what she wants. Any strength, power, or anger not disseminated by a male is frowned upon in this establishment. Something funny happened on the way to artistic freedom and equality for female artists: patriarchy. The funny thing about patriarchy is that it rears its ugly unshaven head and beer laden morning breath over to your side of the bed, hoping to 'get a little' before you get up to get dressed for work. Meanwhile patriarchy stays at home all day, reaping the rewards of the hard work the next 12 hours your day will bring. Patriarchy thinks it has the right to tell you that after working damn hard (twice as hard as he), for 20 years, that you bitches are not allowed to say 'bitch.' Patriarchy dictates that your husband can say the word bitch in every one of his songs for upwards of 20+ years. Yet, the moment you deign to darken the 'bitch' doorstep, you will be brought to task.   How dare you grown woman, of 30+ years with the achievements of a woman 10 times your senior, think that you are successful enough to cuss? You are not allowed to have an opinion or outburst in the world of patriarchy. You must subscribe to all the pretty little properties of a pretty little lady. The moment you articulate the need to express yourself you will be put in your place. Meanwhile, your male counterparts can and will say what the hell they want, at every turn, about you and every other woman they deem disposable. (Which coincidentally, is every woman not named Hillary Clinton). Taking back the 'b' word and spewing it at your discretion contains so much power. I mean, all you have to do is ask every rapper that spouts the n-word in a song, one hundred times within three minutes and 30 seconds.   ""I'm not just his little wife,"" no you are not B., you are not just his little wife. You are a woman that has worked twice as hard as any male while you own triple the talent, to get where you are. Who would be silly enough reduce you to wifedom? Patriarchy. Fed up B? I understand. You have been forced into a box that is not conducive to having your own thoughts. You are not allowed to let your hair weave down and express any angst that you may have with society, your peers or your underlings. You live in a prototypical, patriarchal world where a woman can be pretty, but not petty. You should be docile. Your only indoctrination is to be that which is taught to you by men.   Work hard woman. Break your back woman. Shut up, while doing so woman. Tie that corset tight woman. Display that sexy, no matter how much it hurts. Once those strings unbind your abdomen from its patriarchal prison, don't dare be happy. Sing woman. Sing with the soul, hopelessness and destitution of your ancestors. Do not sing with the anger and outrage for their endless, thankless fruitless toiling that you have slowly come to realize still exists. We/They, want you submissive.   Beyonce is not mad at her fans. Beyonce is mad at her peers and detractors that assume Beyonce is a Stepford Wife, devoid of any emotion or feeling not fed to her by the powers that be. The Internet's reactions to ""Bow Down"" are exactly why she wrote those lyrics in that manner. She has been painted into a pop corner that very few icons escape from drug free (see: Whitney, Michael, Kurt, etc.). That's right world, give her more fuel to for her 'bitch' fire.  ""Bow Down"" is not just about a need to renounce her throne of female perfectionism via male standards. ""Bow Down"" displays a need to let her female counterparts know that they will not be unseating her from her diva throne anytime soon. I do not like every single Beyonce composition that she releases. What I do like is every Beyonce composition that she releases that is unforgivably black, unforgivably woman. ""Bow Down"" contains both of these qualities, times ten. So yes, Beyonce, say the word 'bitch' a million more times. I am going to listen."

(Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1356f200000e800ff91f9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"From TakePart's Jon Bowermaster:Eco-activist Craig Rosebraugh is the first to admit he took “a sizable gamble” by titling his first film so provocatively—Greedy Lying Bastards.The hard-hitting documentary is a sophisticated, four-years-in-the-making look at the deviousness of climate change deniers using archival footage and new interviews. It was intended to be “a bit more in your face” than most docs, Rosebraugh admits.Now showing across the country in more than 30 cities, it appears that despite the provocative title, audiences are ready for climate change films at cineplexes. (See also James Balog’s Chasing Ice, which continues to screen across the country thanks to phenomenal footage of glaciers in retreat and great word of mouth.)Both filmmaker and his eco-audience have been encouraged by mainstream reviews. “A single-minded attack … may just be the feel-good documentary of the year,” wrote the New York Times. “Sober—and sobering,” according to the Washington Post.The documentary is the most detailed telling of climate deniers’ efforts yet, focused on the organizations and individuals who attempt to deflect from the truth about climate change by spending big money and telling outright lies. Who are the bad guys? ExxonMobil, the American Petroleum Institute, the Koch brothers, electric companies…and more. The film also raises the question time and again: Where are our political leaders on climate change?Rosebraugh is not a stranger to the camera, though much of his experience has been on the other side of the lens as a spokesperson for environmental and human rights issues going back two decades. Over the years he’s also been grilled by inquisitors from the FBI and the ATF, primarily during his time as spokesman for the Earth Liberation Front in the days soon after the group admitted burning down a mountaintop ski resort in Vail, Colorado, in the name of preserving a lynx habitat.A New York Times Magazine profile in 1998 said: “Rosebraugh stood out in Portland, if he stood out at all, as the guy who was always getting arrested at anti-vivisection events or locking himself to a door of the corporate headquarters of a hospital group to protest experiments being done on cats.”Rosenbraugh's first film was aided by an experienced team, including editor and cowriter Patrick Gambuti, Jr. and archival producer Marianna Yarovskaya, who worked on the Oscar-winning documentary An Inconvenient Truth. Activist and actress Daryl Hannah joined three years into the process as executive producer. TakePart found Rosebraugh at home in Los Angeles.TakePart: As a first-time filmmaker, what inspired you to take on climate change deniers? Was there a trigger, a moment when you realized you had to make this film?Craig Rosebraugh: There wasn’t one moment, but cumulative. I’d been watching the debate over climate change for a couple decades. As we got late into the 2000s, leading up to the convention in Copenhagen in 2009, I wondered about a project linking the truth that climate change was real and a parallel universe, especially in the United States, of people refusing to listen to the science. Why with the science so sound were politicians refusing to act?One thing that amazed me was how much I learned during the four years we worked on the film. The very deceptive campaigns by energy companies have really done a great job at convincing people that climate change is not real.The film was funded by two independent, private financiers, who wish to stay anonymous. It is their first project in the film industry but their motivation is concern about the issue.Of all the greedy, lying bastards you discovered during the making of the film, who are the greediest, most prevaricating?Christopher Monckton is the one that far and above makes a mockery of himself. Yet despite being debunked time and time again by the scientific community, any time anyone invites him to come and deliver his lies, he continues to show up.In terms of money, it’s hard to beat the Koch brothers. Their influence is everywhere, with their base in oil, oil transportation, oil refining, large cattle ranches, textiles, fertilizers and on and on. Their power is undeniable.A big question raised in the film is why the media continues to allow climate deniers equal time, when the science is clearly against them. “Doubt is way easier to sell” is a great line in the film.Fox is far and away the extreme example. They’ll have a known holocaust denier debating a holocaust survivor. Or a tobacco industry representative still arguing that smoking isn’t linked to cancer.The challenge is how do we get the media to stop presenting the issue as if it were a debate, when the debate is already over. I think it’s up to our lawmakers to make a hefty stand, especially the Republican Party. As long as they continue to publicly question the science of climate change, so will the media.On our website, Expose the Bastards, we’re calling for a Congressional investigation into the deception and lies regarding climate since much like what Congressman Henry Waxman did with the tobacco industry. And it should include an investigation into the media’s role.Big energy has a reputation for aggressively refuting films about climate change and other environmental issues. You’re up against the wealthiest, most powerful industry in the world. Has their been any industry kickback yet?Not yet. My gut is that they’re waiting to see how well the film does. If they go after it, it’s only going to create more publicity. Months ago Monckton threatened a lawsuit, but we’ve not heard anymore since.We’re seeing audiences turn out for films about climate change. Do you think movies about environmental issues can make a difference?Yes, I think they can. An Inconvenient Truth shifted public opinion in a huge way. And industry responded to it too, especially the Koch brothers, who really started pouring money into climate change denying after that.Our film is very activist-oriented. We came up with the title after we’d been working on the film for two years, basically as a promotional device, to see if we could generate interest. We admittedly took a gamble with the title, the way the film is presented, using my writing and narration, to be a bit more in your face. The style may piss some people off, but we really wanted to reach a wide audience, including the people who were behind the Occupy movement, people who want to see change and are tired of big corporations running things.We’ll see in the next couple months if the gamble was worth it."
