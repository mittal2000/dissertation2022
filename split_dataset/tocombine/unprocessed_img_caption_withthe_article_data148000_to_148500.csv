1,TRAVEL,"Delta Passenger Baraka Kanaan Forced To Crawl Down Aisle, Across Tarmac To Wheelchair: Complaint",Ryan Grenoble,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/delta-makes-passenger-crawl_us_5b9d61ffe4b03a1dcc874f88,Caring for and accommodating the needs of customers with disabilities to ensure accessibility is a top priority for Delta,2013-07-26,Businessman sitting in wheelchair at airport (B&W sepia tone),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d61ff2400005000539156.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A Hawaii man says Delta Air Lines forced him to crawl down the aisle of its planes and across the tarmac to reach his wheelchair several times during a trip in July 2012, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court Tuesday. Baraka Kanaan, a nonprofit head and former philosophy professor, says one of the incidents happened last summer when he was en route to Massachusetts from Hawaii via a series of Delta Air Lines flights. Though a car accident in 2000 left him unable to walk and entirely dependent on a wheelchair, aisle chairs, and lifts, he says Delta representatives assured him weeks before his flight ""that he would be received and given reasonable accommodation for his disability.""Yet when Kanaan arrived in Massachusetts, the complaint alleges Delta had none of the equipment needed to help him off the airplane. When he asked what his options were, a flight attendant replied, ""I don't know, but we can't get you off the plane,"" according to a copy of the suit provided to The Huffington Post. Kanaan, in his best suit, then had to ""[crawl] hand over hand through the main cabin and down a narrow flight of stairs and across the tarmac to his wheelchair,"" an experience he says caused ""great physical and emotional suffering,"" the complaint states. On his return trip, Kanaan says he had to repeat the same procedure, as the equipment was still unavailable. However, this time the airline offered to place cardboard beneath him ""so that his clothes wouldn't get dirty,"" the document states. In both incidents, he alleges Delta employees made no effort to try and obtain equipment from other airlines to help him deplane properly.Kanaan's complaints to the airline resulted in a $100 voucher and an offer of 25,000 SkyMiles, which the suit says he declined, fearing his next Delta flight would leave him, again, on his hands and knees.A Delta representative did not immediately respond to The Huffington Post's request for comment but said the airline was looking into the matter. In 2008, a woman with muscular dystrophy experienced a similar situation after she said she was forced to crawl off two separate Delta flights. Reached for contact by Gadling, the woman called her deplaning ""disgraceful"" but was unsure if Delta or the airports were to blame. According to the Air Carrier Access Act, airports and carriers are required to ""provide boarding assistance to individuals with disabilities by using ramps, mechanical lifts, or other suitable devices where level-entry boarding by loading bridge or mobile lounge is not available."" The rule applies to any airplane with a seating capacity of 31 or more passengers.UPDATE: Tuesday, July 30 -- In an emailed statement to The Huffington Post, a Delta representative affirmed the airline's commitment to travelers with disabilities. The spokesperson declined to make any specific statements regarding Kanaan's case, citing the ongoing litigation:Caring for and accommodating the needs of customers with disabilities to ensure accessibility is a top priority for Delta. Our agents and attendants are always available to help our customers before boarding, in the air and at the destination airport. It is Deltaâ€™s policy to fully comply with all applicable rules and regulations governing accessibility for customers with disabilities. This includes providing assistance during the boarding and deplaning process, such as providing timely wheelchair assistance, mechanized lifts, and ramps when needed. We take the allegations that this customer has made in his lawsuit very seriously. However, because this matter is now in litigation we cannot comment on the facts of this particular case. "

Planning and design for the new Sandy Hook school will be funded with a $750,000 grant from the state, said First Selectman Patricia Llorda.""This was the first of two crucial steps in getting a new school built and it was a tremendous show of support by the community,"" Llorda said of a meeting late Wednesday where more than 150 people -- about ten times many people as usually attend town meetings -- crowded into the municipal chambers and unanimously approved the plan.The town has scheduled a public referendum for Oct. 5 where voters will approve or knock down a plan to spend an additional $50 million remaining from the state grant.Students, faculty and staff who survived the rampage have been moved to another school building in a neighboring town.The existing school, where 19-year-old Adam Lanza carried out his attack, will not be demolished until the final vote on the spending, Llorda said.Llodra said Sandy Hook School students will continue to attend Chalk Hill School in neighboring Monroe until June 2016. She said she expects the new school in Sandy Hook to open that September.School Board member John Vouros, a retired Newtown teacher, welcomed the news.""Having taught here for 35 years, this was very important to me personally and to the entire school community and town,"" Vouros said. ""This shows the town is moving forward ... and this is a giant step."" (Editing by Scott Malone and David Gregorio)"

Kirk's earnestness and betting on which red shirt would bite the dust. When I was a bit older, Star Trek: The Next Generation began, and Capt. Picard -- the brave but fair leader of the more modern USS Enterprise -- became my hero. Now that my daughter's 9, she's getting a taste of Picard's brilliance thanks to Netflix and my iPad.Parents have always shared some of their favorite childhood activities with their kids, but before Netflix, Hulu and other streaming services became so easy to access, watching favorite old TV shows was tricky (or expensive). I've put together a list of great older shows that are easy to find and fun to share with kids. Remember, even though these shows are old to you, they're new to kids! (Streaming availability is subject to change, so if you don't find the show in the listed location, seach around and you might find it elsewhere.)The Muppet Show (4+) -- This hilarious blend of puppets and celebs from the '70s and '80s will entertain kids and induce acute nostalgia in parents of a certain age. (YouTube)I Love Lucy (6+) -- Lucille Ball's slapstick comedy never gets old. While the traditional gender dynamics might give you pause, Lucy steals the show without ever revealing more than a knee. (Hulu)Pinky and the Brain (6+) -- Adults and kids will want to ""take over the world"" after watching this clever blend of slapstick and pop culture satire. (YouTube)Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends (6+) -- If you can get past the old-fashioned graphics, this mild but always entertaining classic cartoon delights young kids (and dads) of almost any age. (Netflix)Animaniacs (7+) -- Like Pinky and the Brain, this cartoon blends silly laughs with sophisticated references that will crack up kids and parents. (YouTube)Robotech (7+) -- This complex cartoon introduced anime to a U.S. audience and delighted kids of the '80s. Younger and older kids (and their parents) will love the intricate stories and mix of comedy and action. (YouTube)Voltron (7+) -- While not as deep at Robotech, this giant robot action cartoon will tickle nostalgic parents with its action-packed battles and thrill kids with varied characters and plenty of explosions. (Hulu)Jem and the Holograms (8+) -- Jem and her girl band rock in this glitzy '80s cartoon. With plenty of strong role models and catchy tunes, this one's a winner for all. (Netflix)Star Trek: The Next Generation (8+) -- These sci-fi stories are packed with positive messages about compassion, equality, fairness, and tolerance. Parents might want to preview episodes because appropriateness varies episode to episode. (Netflix)The Twilight Zone (10+) -- These classic morality tales will creep kids out in the best way possible. Not every one's a winner, though, so look for your favorites to share. (Netflix)MacGyver (11+) -- With a lead who chooses ingenuity over violence and creates so many cool contraptions, what kid wouldn't enjoy this feathered-haired hero? (Netflix)Quantum Leap (12+) -- It looks a bit cheesy to modern eyes, but Quantum Leap will appeal to kids fascinated with time travel and the concept of body swapping. (Netflix)Seinfeld (14+) -- This classic full of quirky characters will appeal to snarky teens from any era. (Crackle)Which shows would you add to this list?
