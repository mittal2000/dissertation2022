One yardstick that is never used but should be, is the simple ratio of market capitalization to pay. It takes into account the entire value of the company to shareholders and weighs it directly against annual compensation.At the one end of the compensation to market cap ratio are relatively small companies that have very highly paid CEOs. At the other are chief executives at large companies who work for more modest sums and are either paid well for extraordinary financial results or have boards that believe that CEOs should not be paid like sultans.Read: America’s Least Valuable CEOsAlso Read: America’s Most Valuable CEOsEvery year, the media come out with lists of American public company CEOs who makes tens of millions of dollars. While some may have earned the money because of phenomenal results, others are paid well despite poor results. Our list of least valuable CEOs is based on chief executives who are paid handsomely, even though they run corporations with modest market caps and sales. Additionally, most of their companies have not done well, either financially or in terms of stock market performance.Some of the companies on this list are run by founders or large shareholders. These people may well be in a position to have outsized influence over their own pay packages, which puts shareholders in an impossible position to effectively protest compensation. Other CEOs have been hired fairly recently to turn companies around. They have been paid well to take jobs in which they are expected to post great improvement, but they have not done so yet, and may never.24/7 Wall St. identified the least valuable CEOs based on executive pay relative to company market cap. We reviewed the market cap and CEO compensation for every S&P 500 company as of Dec. 31, 2011. If a company’s stock performance exceeded that of the S&P 500 Index between December 30th, 2011 and November 12th, 2012 it was excluded.

And this isn't the first time Bimbo has tried to save Twinkies. Bimbo in conjunction with a few others made a bid for the Twinkie-maker during its first bankruptcy 2007, but Bimbo ultimately backed out, according to Forbes.Bimbo's access to cheap Mexican sugar might also give the company an upper hand. Hostess struggled with high sugar prices in the U.S., which were tied to trade tariffs, according to NBC News. Mexican sugar could help avoid those additional costs, but would also take production -- and manufacturing jobs -- south of the border.Labor talks between Hostess and the unions that represent most of its 19,000 workers had gone on for months before the company's decision to liquidate Friday. However, the gap left by departing Hostess jobs could be potentially be filled by other U.S. companies.“It may well be that other US producers step into the void and expand their US production, in which case the Hostess liquidation might not be a total loss,” says Chris Edwards, a Cato Institute economist, told the Christian Science Monitor.Twinkie fans have treated the popular snack food like a prized commodity following the news of Hostess' intent to liquidate on Friday. Hawkers on eBay and Craigslist began selling stashes of Hostess products online Saturday, reportedly for hundreds, and even thousands of dollars.But the strange, snack-cake related behavior doesn't stop there. A bizarre petition urging President Barack Obama to ""nationalize the Twinkie industry"" circulated in the wake of the Hostess announcement. "

Such agreements are used by banks to lend and borrow. A risk could arise if one of the parties in the chain collapses.The European Commission is expected to propose EU-wide rules for shadow banking next year."

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2dd183c000066000c391c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Edward KrudyNEW YORK, Nov 18 (Reuters) - The ""fiscal cliff"" sounds like a scary place. Headlines about ""taxmaggeddon"" are flashing on TV screens, next to clocks ticking down to Jan. 1.The Dow Jones Industrial Average has skidded more than 7 percent over the last month, largely due to concerns about the standoff in Congress over how to stop a barrage of tax hikes and spending cuts.But some major investors say the doomsayers are getting too much attention and cliff watchers should relax a bit.These investors argue that the U.S. economy does not face immediate disaster if lawmakers can't reach a deal by the end of the year, and there will still be time for Washington to come up with a deal in early 2013 before major damage starts to be done.""It is not impossible at all that they miss by a little and then come back and get it,"" said billionaire investor Ken Fisher, whose firm Fisher Investments oversees about $38 billion in equities. ""There's a minor risk ... but getting it done 10 days later is not really a big deal.""Others say Washington has more time than that.Billionaire investor Warren Buffett, long supportive of higher taxes for America's super-rich, told CNN this week that lawmakers could have as much as a couple of months next year to reach a deal.""The fact that can't get along for the month of January is not going to torpedo the economy,"" he said.Chief executives warn of the damaging effects of uncertainty on their investment and hiring decisions. Many investors have focused on the risk of a new recession if the cliff is not addressed. And tumbling stock prices can add to the sense of panic and hurt both business and consumer confidence.The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the tax hikes and spending cuts would amount to $600 billion in 2013 and could cause the U.S. economy to contract by nearly 3 percent in the first half of the year.But that does not mean the pain begins automatically at the start of January.For example, there could be a long lag, possibly lasting several months, between Jan. 2, when the budgets of government agencies would be cut, and the actual implementation of those cuts to programs ranging from research grants to court room security.On the tax side, the Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have flexibility as to when to implement new, higher taxes. And even if higher withholding rates do take effect in January, they could be retroactively reversed later in the year.In short, what has been dubbed a cliff is more like a fiscal slope that gets steeper as time goes on. How far the U.S. economy slides down it will depend on how quickly lawmakers in Washington take to do a deal.A lot will depend on whether talks between administration officials and Congressional leaders can remain cordial and appear to be making progress, even if that progress is slow. They got off to what seemed to be a good start on Friday when both Democratic and Republican Congressional leaders came out of a meeting with President Barack Obama talking about the need for a deal, giving a boost to U.S. stock prices.But some are skeptical. J. Dan Denbow, a fund manager at USAA in San Antonio, Texas, has been watching the value of his precious metals funds tank as fears of a U.S. recession dent the asset class. He thinks Congress will end up going over the cliff and that markets are in for a lot more volatility.""Everybody's playing nice in the same sandbox,"" said Denbow of the recent round of cross-party meetings at the White House. ""But they don't tell you what kind of cat fights they had behind closed doors."" KNIVES POISED, NO ORDERS TO CUT YETStephen Fuller, an economist at George Mason University, said it could take until the end of March before spending cuts begin to be implemented.The government's budget managers appear to be in no hurry to take out their scissors.The Office of Budget Management, the executive branch tasked with overseeing the cuts, has issued a report detailing how they will affect 1,200 government agency accounts. But breaking this down to a program-by-program plan is proving ""challenging,"" given the scale of the task, the OMB said.By the end of October the OMB had not advised agencies how to prepare for the so-called sequesters, or automatic spending cuts, according to a government budget expert who had talked to staff at OMB as well as agency budget offices.The expert, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the OMB was still waiting for lists of programs from the Defense Department.The agencies ""would see the reduction in the funds that they have in Treasury immediately but obviously it takes a while for all that spending to occur so that's why people are talking about the fiscal slope in terms of the sequestration cuts,"" the budget expert said. TAXING ISSUESA more immediate concern in terms of the economic impact is the expiration on Jan. 1 of the Bush-era tax cuts and the lower payrolls tax cuts which were introduced in early 2011. If they lapse, American consumers could see an immediate bite out of their take-home pay as tax rates revert to higher levels.However, government tax lawyers, speaking off the record because they were not authorized to talk publicly, said the U.S. tax code gives the Treasury and the IRS some flexibility when deciding withholding levels appropriate to tax law.If legislation was in progress to restore all or some of the tax cuts early in 2013 they might be able to hold off on increasing withholdings from paychecks, they said.There is also the option of cutting taxes retroactively after the new higher rates have been introduced. This could end up in rates lower than current level to make up for any temporary payment of higher tax rates, giving a boost the economy once applied, experts say.There may be further room for maneuver by U.S. tax officials.Americans typically give more to the tax man than they need with each paycheck and end up getting a rebate after the end of each tax year. That may allow tax officials to refrain from applying at least part of any higher rates in early 2013, if a deal to restore lower tax rates appears close.""My understanding is the law gives a lot of flexibility,"" said Bob Williams, an economist at the liberal-leaning Urban Institute and previously a tax specialist at the CBO.Two years ago, Congress was in a similar situation when a fight over whether to extend the Bush-era tax rates for the wealthy went down to the wire. A deal was not reached until mid-December.""They (the Treasury) didn't know that for sure and they didn't issue (instructions to raise taxes) right away ... and that turned out OK,"" Williams said."

""They don't realize how every animal out there has feelings, has a heart and soul, has emotions. It only takes meeting them once to really feel that.""Elizabeth took to Twitter earlier this week to express her outrage over a recent undercover video alleging turkey abuse at a Butterball facility. The company reports to account for 20 percent of total U.S. turkey production. Although Butterball emphasized its ""zero tolerance policy for animal abuse,"" this is not the first time that their facilities have been accused of animal cruelty. Elizabeth suggests that ""this would be a different conversation if it was the olden days where we had to hunt these animals for food ... That's not what happens these days. The way these animals are treated, shot up with antibiotics and hormones, just to get really big, really fast, it's a whole different situation and it's not healthy for you.""This year, 254 million turkeys will be raised in the U.S. In 2011, HuffPost's Lynne Peeples reported that a large majority of turkeys in the U.S. are raised on factory farms, with most fed a diet that includes low doses of antibiotics. Experts warn that the common agricultural practice poses a large risk to public health.Given the many alternatives now available, Elizabeth feels ""there's absolutely no reason to contribute to the killing of these animals. We're not living like cavemen."" Come Thanksgiving Day, she looks forward to other traditional foods like potatoes (both sweet and mashed), green beans, and last but certainly not least, the desserts. ""Who needs to kill an animal?"" she said. ""That's not a good tradition. I think it's time that we start setting new traditions.""

(AP Photo/Metropolitan Opera, Ken Howard)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb23c4c2000009900ffda3b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Passion, jealousy, vengeance, and regicide returned to the Metropolitan Opera stage Friday night in a revival of La Clemenza di Tito that boasts a fine cast led by a superb Elina Garanca, who captures all the pathos and anguish of thwarted love and betrayed loyalty in Mozart's last opera. That conflict of love and loyalty will be the focus of the Met's Live in HD series over the next two Saturdays. The Dec. 1 performance of La Clemenza di Tito will be simulcast to some 1,900 movie theaters in 64 countries around the world, and the Met's new production of Verdi's Un Ballo in Maschera will be shown the following week, on Dec. 8. Tito is a final testament to Mozart's genius, especially considering it was a major rush job. He was asked to write it in July 1791 for the occasion of the Austrian emperor Leopold II's coronation as king of Bohemia in Prague on Sept. 6, and he reportedly composed the entire opera in 18 days.For such an august occasion Mozart returned to the form of ""opera seria,"" or ""serious opera."" He had just finished, or had nearly finished, Die Zauberflote, quite a different kind of opera, when he got the commission. Zauberflote had its premiere some three weeks after Tito, and Mozart died two months later. The story line concerns the Emperor Titus, the penultimate of the 12 Caesars whose arch in Rome commemorates his conquest of Jerusalem. Like Un Ballo it is loosely based on fact (Titus pardoned two nobles who plotted to kill him), though also with a love interest thrown in to spice up the plot. In the opera, Tito is looking for a wife and Vitellia, daughter of a previous emperor, thinks she should be chosen. When she is at first passed over, she convinces Sesto, who is Tito's most devoted follower but who also is in love with Vitellia, to murder the emperor out of spite. Tito manages to escape and although the Senate condemns Sesto to death for the attempt, the emperor grants him clemency. From its first performance, Tito has prompted more extreme opinions than any other Mozart opera. The Italian wife of Leopold II pronounced it ""German rubbish"" (""porcheria tedesca"") at its premiere, but for 50 years after Mozart's death it was more often performed than any other of his operas. It was largely ignored for the next 100 years, but has regained popularity over the past few decades, especially with the Met's 1984 production, and the cast it has assembled for this revival argue for its greatness. Garanca has a crystal clear mezzo voice, warm and embracing, that conveys the entire range of Sesto's changing emotions. Her opening act aria ""Parto, parto,"" with the accompanying clarinet solo from Anthony McGill, is almost a religious experience. There are actually two trouser roles - or given the ancient Rome setting, toga roles - in Tito, and in the second one Kate Lindsey offers an admirable turn as Annio, who is in love with Sesto's sister, Servilia.Giuseppe Filianoti is commanding in the title role, his solid tenor full of authority and, at the end, compassion. Barbara Frittoli sings Vitellia convincingly, especially in her Act 2 aria ""Non piu di fiori"" And in her Metropolitan debut, the English soprano Lucy Crowe is impressive as Servilia. From the opening bars of the rousing and majestic overture, the Met Orchestra plays magnificently throughout under Harry Bicket's baton, and Bradley Brookshire provides excellent harpsichord accompaniment for the recitatives. The Met chorus sings splendidly, and Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's set of ancient Roman columns holds up surprisingly well."

(AP Photo/ Marko Drobnjakovic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6c2371f0000000224dd04.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Douglas Perry, Tennis.com  Could Czech fans have felt confident about their team’s Davis Cup fate resting with Radek Stepanek? The 33-year-old is best known for the belly-flopping post-match celebrations he once offered up, not that he ever got to show off The Worm all that often. He’s won only five singles titles in his long career, all at minor tournaments. One of the reasons for this limited success is obvious enough: Stepanek is the player that time forgot; he’s held onto a flying, whack-and-attack style that went out of fashion with the mullet.But Spanish fans probably didn’t feel any better about having to rely on Nicolas Almagro. The 27-year-old Spaniard, ranked 11th in the world, has loads of talent but has never known quite what to do with it, especially in big matches. He’s reached just three major quarterfinals in his career, all at the French Open.Old Man Stepanek, with his Mick Jagger lips and rock ’n’ roll showmanship, had to be considered the favorite coming into the match, for Almagro is a claycourt guy to his core and Prague’s O2 Arena has been playing like a bowling alley. Stepanek delivered in the decider, scoring a 6-4, 7-6 (0), 3-6, 6-3 victory to clinch the Davis Cup for the Czech Republic.Of course, Davis Cup is as much about emotions and guts as it is about match ups. So it was no surprise that both players were tense and nervy early on. Stepanek clanked his groundstrokes repeatedly in his first service game. Almagro gave up two doubles faults in his. But both men held and settled in for the long haul.Stepanek made the first move, going for outlandish winners from the baseline and picking volleys off his shoes. He earned the first set point at 4-5 with a brilliant series of checkerboard moves, sending Almagro sprinting to and fro at oblique angles until the Spaniard simply ran out of court. The Czech then nailed down the set with a thumping backhand service return that Almagro couldn’t handle. Stepanek marched off the court, fist held high, biceps and lips plumped to the bursting point.It was clear how much this meant to the combatants: two second-tier players in the deciding rubber of a Davis Cup final. They both recognized that this match could be key to how they’ll be remembered in their sport -- or if they’ll be remembered.True to the stakes, the match immediately proved highly entertaining, far more so than the David Ferrer-Tomas Berdych match that set it up. The difference early on was Stepanek’s variety: on a good day and up against a player outside the Top 10, he can make you believe serve-and-volley tennis really does still have a place in professional tennis. But most of all, he moved exceptionally well, hitting his forehand on the dead run with a muscular flick of the wrist, and scrambling for every shot. Almagro, on the other hand, sometimes looked like he was on Heathrow’s moving walkway, easing toward the ball with an odd, glassy-eyed detachment.To be sure, Almagro’s sleepy countenance can be deceiving. After struggling to hold serve early in the second set, the Spaniard came alive with a whiplash down-the-line backhand winner. He turned the momentum by breaking Stepanek and then quickly holding for a 4-2 lead. Just like that, it no longer felt like a fair fight. Watching Almagro bang down huge serves and unleash that wicked one-handed backhand, you can only wonder why he hasn’t had more success on hard courts.The thing is, as soon as anyone starts thinking such thoughts about Almagro, he starts missing shots by half a foot. Stepanek cleverly drew the Spaniard forward on a break point and then used a he-man forehand-backhand combination to level the match at 4-all.The battle raged on into a tiebreak, but Stepanek was willing to leave more of himself out there, including skin and blood after diving for a volley. The Czech hit hard, flat groundstrokes that often skipped the net, and he carved angled volleys to within a breath of the lines. The intensity from across the net proved too much for Almagro. The Spaniard stepped back onto the moving walkway and watched the tiebreak pass him by, 7-0.That should have been the end of Almagro. In any of the majors, it would have been the end of him. But this was Davis Cup, and Stepanek was playing his third best-of-five match in as many days. In the third set, Almagro hardly looked like a man on the ropes. He served big and hit out when he had to, and Stepanek let him do it. The set quickly went to the Spaniard, 6-3. Was Stepanek, looking increasingly bedraggled, suddenly in trouble?Nope. He just wanted to make things a little more interesting. After scoring an early break, he continued to swoop forward, knocking off volleys straight out of a dog-eared copy of Rod Laver’s “228 Tennis Tips.” The Big Game is still a beautiful thing, and it can still rattle an opponent — especially a claycourt specialist on an indoor hard court. The mood became a little testy in the 4-2 game when partisans in the crowd decided to get into the line-calling business and Stepanek’s forehand started looking a little tight. But the Czech veteran held, pushing Almagro’s back right up against the wall. In Stepanek’s next service game, he smacked two big serves to reach match point. The end came with Almagro dropping a backhand into the net, giving the Czech Republic its first Davis Cup title as an independent country and Stepanek a secure place in tennis history books. "

As part of the settlement, announced late Friday, July 13 stores from Rite Aid to Kroger will be allowed to charge customers more if they pay using a credit card. (AP Photo/Nick Ut, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c845a26000035007f8250.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Although it may not feel like a very personal gift, you probably can't go wrong giving a gift card as a holiday present. Gift cards/certificates and cash are the top two gifts consumers want to receive this holiday season, according to the Deloitte annual holiday survey.And prepaid cards continue to grow in popularity, sometimes as an alternative to a checking account and sometimes as a type of gift card.Is one better than the other? Here we describe the differences so you can decide.For purposes of this article, prepaid cards refers to reloadable prepaid cards -- and not to cards that are marketed as a way to give someone a specific amount of money as a gift. This is an important distinction because reloadable prepaid cards are not covered by the Credit CARD Act's rules for gift cards, while true gift cards -- even those that carry the American Express, Visa or MasterCard logo -- are.Flexibility: Gift cards: Cards that are associated with a particular retailer can, of course, only be used to make purchases at that retail store. Depending on the retailer, though, it may be possible to use a gift card for one store to purchase a gift card to another retailer, though that's not always possible. (You can't buy a Limited Express gift card at Aeropostale, for example, though you may be able to buy an Amazon gift card at Office Depot.) If you've received gift cards you don't plan to use, you can sell them on gift card exchange sites, or exchange them for a card you prefer. You can also buy gift cards at a discount on these sites. Not sure which store your gift recipient prefers? Consider a mall-wide card, or a card that carries the logo of one of the major card issuers, so that the person who gets the card can can shop at all the stores in the mall or wherever he or she wants.Prepaid cards: These cards are very flexible since they can be accepted anywhere that particular brand of card -- MasterCard, Visa, or American Express -- is accepted.Lost or Stolen Cards Gift cards: If you lose a retail gift card, you may be out of luck unless you can prove to the merchant that you purchased the card, or report the loss or theft before the balance is used. If you registered the gift card through the merchant when you received it, then the first problem is taken care of, and as long as the card hasn't been used you should be able to get the card canceled and a new one reissued. (Individual retailers may set their own policies.Prepaid cards: You may have more protection here than with retail gift cards. American Express cards carry its Fraud Protection Guarantee; Visa cards are covered by Visa's Zero Liability policy; and cards carrying the MasterCard logo are covered by MasterCard's Zero Liability Protection. These programs generally mean that cardholders aren't responsible for fraudulent purchases as long as the loss or theft is reported promptly. However, there are some exceptions; for example, Visa purchases made with a PIN and not processed on the Visa network. Consumer Action pointed out in its survey of prepaid cards that there are gaps in this protection, so read the fine print.To be on the safe side, always register a gift card or prepaid card right away and keep a receipt, if you have one, in case your card is lost or stolen or you run into a problem with the card.Fees Gift Cards: The CARD Act prohibits inactivity or service fees in the first year, and after the first year there can only be one fee assessed per month. A general purpose gift card (such as one carrying the Visa, American Express or MasterCard logo) may charge a fee when you purchase the card.Prepaid Cards: Most of these cards charge a monthly fee, and may charge other service fees. For example, there may be a fee to reload money, withdraw funds at an ATM or even to receive a paper statement.Expiration Dates Gift Cards: Cannot expire in less than five years, per the CARD Act. However, if fees are charged after the first year, they can erode the balance.Prepaid Cards: The Federal Reserve reports that the average prepaid card is active for six months or less. If you let a prepaid card sit on the shelf, the value can drop -- sometimes fairly quickly -- due to monthly fees.This article originally appeared on Credit.com.

During his life and since his death, people everywhere have wondered how one man could have possessed such genius. Now, scientists may have uncovered a clue within the physicist's unusual brain.  The images of Einstein’s brain are published in Falk, Lepore & Noe 2012, (The cerebral cortex of Albert Einstein: a description and preliminary analysis of unpublished photographs, ""Brain"") and are reproduced here with permission from the National Museum of Health and Medicine, Silver Spring, Md.According to a new study led by Florida State University evolutionary anthropologist Dean Falk, ""portions of Einstein’s brain have been found to be unlike those of most people and could be related to his extraordinary cognitive abilities.""""Certain things are normal,"" Falk told The Huffington Post in a phone interview. ""Brain size is normal. Overall shape is asymmetrical, and that is normal. What is unusual is the complexity and convolution in the various parts of the brain.""According to a written statement issued by the university, the study, published Nov. 16 in the journal ""Brain,"" reveals the description of Einstein's entire cerebral cortex. To do this, Falk and her colleagues examined 14 recently uncovered photographs of Einstein's brain -- photos that, Falk said, were difficult to obtain.When Einstein died in 1955, his brain was removed by Thomas Harvey, a doctor at the hospital where the physicist died, NPR notes. It is likely that Harvey never got permission to remove the brain, but as author Brian Burrell writes in ""Postcards from the Brain Museum,"" the doctor got a posthumous stamp of approval from Einstein's son. Harvey had said that he intended to study the brain, or at the very least, to find other scientists to do so -- something that was never satisfactorily achieved in the doctor's lifetime.Still, scientists are now able to study Einstein's brain thanks to a number of photos and specimen slides that Harvey had prepared of the organ. The brain, which was photographed from multiple angles, also has been sectioned into 240 blocks from which histological slides were made.As the FSU statement notes, most of the photographs, blocks and slides were lost from public sight for more than 55 years; fortunately, a number of them have been recently rediscovered and some can now be found at the National Museum of Health and Medicine.It was with a few of these images, 14 to be exact, that Falk and her colleagues were able to take a closer look at Einstein's brain. What they discovered was astonishing. “Although the overall size and asymmetrical shape of Einstein’s brain were normal, the prefrontal, somatosensory, primary motor, parietal, temporal and occipital cortices were extraordinary,” said Falk, who compared the organ to 85 other human brains already described in the scientific literature. “These may have provided the neurological underpinnings for some of his visuospatial and mathematical abilities.” (Highlights of Einstein’s brain; published in Falk, Lepore & Noe (2012) and are reproduced here with permission from the National Museum of Health and Medicine, Silver Spring, Md.)For instance, Falk explained to The Huffington Post, parts of Einstein's frontal lobe are ""extra convoluted,"" his parietal lobes are in some parts ""extraordinarily asymmetrical,"" and his primary somatosensory and motor cortices near the regions that typically represent face and tongue are ""greatly expanded in the left hemisphere.""""I was blown away,"" she said. Albert Galaburda, a neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School in Boston, told Science magazine that ""what's great about this paper is that it puts down…the entire anatomy of Einstein's brain in great detail."" But, he added, the study raises ""very important questions for which we don't have an answer.""""Among them are whether Einstein started off with a special brain that predisposed him to be a great physicist, or whether doing great physics caused certain parts of his brain to expand. Einstein's genius, Galaburda says, was probably due to 'some combination of a special brain and the environment he lived in,'"" the magazine continues. Interest in Einstein's brain is by no means a new phenomenon. As Burrell writes, ""the brain of Albert Einstein has acquired a notoriety out of all proportion to its value as an anatomical specimen."" In 1999, scientists at Ontario's McMaster University were able to compare the shape and size of Einstein's brain with those of about 90 people with average intelligence, according to the BBC. The researchers, who used a few of Harvey's other photographs, found at the time that at least ""one area of his brain was significantly different than most people's."" Years later, Falk took her first stab at analyzing Einstein's brain and at the time, had claimed to have identified ""a number of previously unrecognized unusual features"" of the organ, Science magazine wrote in 2009. As USA Today reports, the locations of some chunks of Einstein's brain are still unknown, so ""the photos of the full, pre-dissected brain are a real find."" The door is now open for other scientists to learn more about the legendary physicist's brain. ""This is a starting place,"" Falk told The Huffington Post. ""In this study, we [tried to set] the groundwork by thoroughly describing the brain as much as we can, interpreting our findings and suggesting hypotheses for other scientists who will, I'm sure, will want to look at these slides in the future.""For instance, Falk said, scientists could look at ""brains of gifted people and compare them to Einstein's.""""There's a revolution going on in neuroscience right now... and there is technology that can make these images more meaningful,"" she said.
