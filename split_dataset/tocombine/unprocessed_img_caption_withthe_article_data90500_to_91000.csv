2,BUSINESS,My Favorite Billionaires,"Thaddeus McCarthy, ContributorConnector",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/my-favorite-billionaires_b_7157288.html,I want to write today about the one topic that perhaps interests me above all others... billionaires. The reason that this topic interests me above all others is that I find it fascinating how these people got to where they are.,2015-04-29,2015-04-27-1430175050-5827286-MAC24_ELONMUSK99www.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-27-1430175050-5827286-MAC24_ELONMUSK99www-thumb.jpg,"I want to write today about the one topic that perhaps interests me above all others... billionaires. The reason that this topic interests me above all others is that I find it fascinating how these people got to where they are. Just in general I find it interesting how everyone in life gets to where they are. Although where you are born does influence your life to a great deal in life, in effect it is useless for the individual to complain about their birthplace, because quite simply you can't do anything about that. I will start off by mentioning here that I don't admire most of the billionaires who inherited their fortune. The few that I do are people like Ivanka Trump, who although not a billionaire yet, is out there forging her own path despite the billions that are undoubtedly coming to her. There are also those billionaires who got where they are through being cruel and brutal. The best example of this type of billionaire is perhaps Pablo Escobar, the Colombian drug lord who achieved billionaire status in the 1980s. The mega rich who I admire are those that started from (basically) scratch, have led awesome lives, and have done it in a way that has not been overly detrimental to other people's health and wellbeing. Judging upon this criteria, I think the three most awesome billionaires alive today are Warren Buffett, Mark Cuban and Elon Musk. In this write-up I will write about these three guys, and will finish with mentioning a past billionaire who I think is pretty cool, and with a common statement about all these people and why I admire them so much.The first thing I will say about Warren Buffett is that most people would not regard the life he has led as being interesting. Hopefully all the readers of this blog will know of Buffett as the greatest investor of all time. He was born in 1930, started his first entrepreneurial venture at 13, and at the age of 26 started up his first investment partnership, which was called The Buffett Partnership. In the 1980s, he achieved billionaire status, and in 2008 he spent a brief bit of time as the world's richest person. In recent years though, he has become most famous for committing 85 percent of his fortune to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. It is my belief that for the real foundations for Buffet's great fortune were built in the 60s, and 70s. This was a period when Buffett was a very reclusive figure and spent the vast portion of his time cooped up in his home office. There was a great story about his neighbor, Donald Keough, who would eventually become the president of Coca Cola. Donald regarded his neighbor as strange and lazy, since he never seemed to leave his house. Considering Buffett's somewhat everyday way of acquiring wealth (the share market), and his philanthropic plans for giving away his fortune, he is often regarded as the most ethical billionaire. I also think the fact that he holed himself up in his room, and his neighbors regarded as lazy, to be pretty awesome.I regard Mark Cuban as an awesome billionaire just because he seems to have led a pretty damn cool life. Unlike Buffett, you cannot really classify Cuban in any particular profession. Because although he acquired the vast majority of his wealth in the early Internet Age, he is also the owner of the Dallas Mavericks and has interests in film and reality TV. He was born in 1958 into a typically middle class family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He began his first entrepreneurial venture at age 12 by selling sets of garbage bags. At University he started giving dance lessons, and started up his own bar, Motley's. After leaving college, he started work selling software, but shortly left and formed a consulting business, Micro-solutions. In 1990 he sold the company for $6 million, taking time off afterwards to travel the world and drink with the locals. I think this is perhaps the most awesome part of his story. In 1995 however, he returned to the world of business by starting AudioNet, which he was eventually able to sell for $5.7 billion to Yahoo in 1999. He went on after this to indulge in other interests. I think the best thing about Cuban is that he never once settled, which was one of Steve Job's greatest pieces of advise for would-be Entrepreneurs. Quite simply I believe that Mark Cuban embodies the qualities of a boss. You can see it on his face at Maverick games, and it is showed by his ability to get things done. Elon Musk, is in my personal opinion, the single greatest billionaire of all time. Like Cuban, a great thing about Musk is that he never settles. He has created so many great businesses, but he is never afraid to tackle a problem despite having seemingly no time. This was best shown by his write-up proposal for the Hyperloop a couple of years ago. I mean, how did this guy manage to write a 56-page document for a complex transport system, despite running two multi-billion dollar companies (Tesla and Space X), as well as being chairman for another (Solar City)? The guy is quite simply just a legend. Born in 1971, at age 12 he sold his first computer game, and famously moved to Canada from South Africa at age 17. Running through the University system Queen's and Wharton, he then started a PHD at Stanford, but left after two days to pursue his ambitions. Again and again, he moved on from building one company after another. First with Zip 2, then Paypal, then Solar City. Although he didn't initially found Tesla he has had an enormous part in it's success, along with Solar City, which is run by his cousins. One of the odd, but most wickedly awesome things about Elon is his involvement in a couple of movies. Tony Stark in 'Iron Man' was based on him, and the plane used in 'Thankyou for Smoking' was his own, a Dassault Falcon 500. At age 43, I think we can expect many more great things from Elon, and I for one am happy to live in the same time as this man.Warren Buffett, Mark Cuban and Elon Musk are easily my three favorite billionaires living today. Of those that are dead and gone, my favorite would have to be Howard Hughes. Although he inherited a successful business at age 18, he was similar to Cuban and Musk in that he never settled on one venture or occupation. He was well-known for making movies and having a large range of interests in aviation. Although he became a notorious recluse in later life, he lived an incredibly interesting life. As stated at the beginning of this blog, I don't simply admire this group of billionaires for their wealth, but for the different and really interesting lives they have led. They haven't followed convention and have in affect, created their own paths in life. We do after all, only get one life, and these people have made the most of theirs. The ideas of not following the conventional path and living life to the fullest is similar to some big sporting stars like Michael Jordan and Roger Federer, and it is one of the reasons everyone should admire these people. We should never lead someone else's life. We are on this world to lead our own and we are here to live it to the full."

Her work, in all its varying disciplines (painting, crafting, mixed media) covers a large swath of ground, ensuring all the details of her tales are taken into account.  So That I May Carry You With Me is an exquisitely detailed pastiche at the Daum Museum in Sedalia, Missouri. She unflinchingly discusses the diaspora that has our country teetering between xenophobia and open borders. A bit uneven in places, Hartman's work underscores the spiritual and human accountability we all face as one person, one planet.Encompassing pieces she has produced and shown in past exhibitions along with new work, the show feels like a retrospective. However, I think what Hartman accomplishes is a tale in full. Everything she created has been leading to this point. She takes visitors in concentric circles before leading us into a center of portraiture of refugees from political and societal breakdowns around the globe that is the nucleus of everything before it. A hallmark of a strong artist is the ability to leave a footprint of recognizable styles.  Secrets and Outtakes: Was It Met (2014) is one such idea. Tribal influences crafted into shapes like puzzle pieces that don't quite fit. The abstract tone of the work and colors draws you closer. What Was Beautiful (2007-14) behaves like stream of consciousness thoughts, like a diary that no one should read; its musings are private and cathartic. These snippets of conversation also leave blank spots in places where the text is lightly covered over, a translucent thought that has faded with time, which are the most intriguing components. What is not being said is where Hartman understands how a good story is told. Pauses for reflection or the insertion of ones own ideas that allow for individual reflection. As with Rhyming The Lines (2010), the amoeba-like shapes also show a blurring of text that implies a multiplication of new thoughts. I theorize that Hartman intentionally wants us to not hold one specific or definite idea, as everyone's story is inherently different. The idea of incorporating snaps, buttons and other ephemera into the work also implies a transiency that supports this idea.Prominently displayed, Alphabets and Earth: The Clay Letters (2015), extends all walls of the gallery. It brings a message of peace with an adage to treat your neighbor with decency and respect. Individual earthen letters hung speaks to the many who cross our borders for myriad reasons and all of them are interchangeable to say something different. Sometimes one sees art with expressions and thoughts incorporated can over-elucidate and squelch its intentions, but this massive work, along with What Was Beautiful is the concept of Journo-Expressionism done properly. Where Hartman's work falters is  Icons from a Broken World (2014), found at the heart of this exhibition, an internal gallery displaying eight portraits of refugees. Portraiture is not Hartman's strong suit, the paintings themselves are not completed with the same confidence or dexterity of everything previous. All done in straight-on head and shoulder poses, the subtlety of the exhibition up to this points suddenly stops. Hartman's real talents are presentation and iconography. These are earnest paintings but lack the definitive power of the words and their mosaic qualities on other works. The addition of glass beads to the portraits, painstakingly applied, highlight the subjects flatness. She covers the gamut of refugee imagery but in their sittings all appear the same; distraught, vacant, drawn. While this is a necessary truth, their glass-beaded backgrounds only highlight the portraits flatness. I'm disappointed as Hartman's craftsmanship is otherwise exceptional. Hartman understands pastiche and mosaic and these paintings could be redone more abstractedly. I would direct her eye to Mickalene Thomas or Chuck Close for portraiture that elicits incredible power without succumbing to any ordinariness. By putting these works in its own gallery within a gallery is smart curating and all the more reason to render such ideas with a concept that reveals the pain of her subjects experiences in a more difficult, abstract manner.Returning to ideas that Hartman knows best, Alphabets and Earth is a series of cryptic iconography from Serbia, South Sudan, Rwanda, Poland, Germany and Hungary. Created in a style that reveals the concept of strangers in a strange land uncovers small, intimate propositions. Painstakingly created on a small scale, anything larger would lose their immediacy for these are elegant prose that is nothing short of hypnotic. People want something glistening and hopeful to hold onto. Hartman does both; she presents a spiritual reconciliation while asking us to stare into the abyss. She is aware of humankind's' temporal, temporary state. We are a species always in transit, always in flux. But Hartman manages to boil down the hardened outer shell to reveal the sweet fruit of spirituality that encompasses all the thoughts and feelings that might otherwise become impossible to digest.

While this is a necessary truth, their glass-beaded backgrounds only highlight the portraits flatness. I'm disappointed as Hartman's craftsmanship is otherwise exceptional. Hartman understands pastiche and mosaic and these paintings could be redone more abstractedly. I would direct her eye to Mickalene Thomas or Chuck Close for portraiture that elicits incredible power without succumbing to any ordinariness. By putting these works in its own gallery within a gallery is smart curating and all the more reason to render such ideas with a concept that reveals the pain of her subjects experiences in a more difficult, abstract manner.Returning to ideas that Hartman knows best, Alphabets and Earth is a series of cryptic iconography from Serbia, South Sudan, Rwanda, Poland, Germany and Hungary. Created in a style that reveals the concept of strangers in a strange land uncovers small, intimate propositions. Painstakingly created on a small scale, anything larger would lose their immediacy for these are elegant prose that is nothing short of hypnotic. People want something glistening and hopeful to hold onto. Hartman does both; she presents a spiritual reconciliation while asking us to stare into the abyss. She is aware of humankind's' temporal, temporary state. We are a species always in transit, always in flux. But Hartman manages to boil down the hardened outer shell to reveal the sweet fruit of spirituality that encompasses all the thoughts and feelings that might otherwise become impossible to digest.

Alan Mollohan (D-W.Va.) came under scrutiny after a conservative watchdog group filed a 500-page complaint alleging that he created a string of nonprofit groups in West Virginia through which he steered millions of dollars in earmarked federal funds, enriching himself and his associates.The Department of Justice closed the investigation without bringing any charges in 2010, several months before Mollohan lost his re-election bid. But a liberal watchdog group that had also targeted Mollohan, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, obtained the federal files from the case last year and found reams of damning testimony against him, leading CREW to declare that Mollohan should have been prosecuted.Instead, he became a lobbyist. He appears to have landed as a significant client the National White Collar Crime Center, based in West Virginia. That outfit bills itself as a nonprofit that ""delivers training to thousands of law enforcement professionals in the areas of computer forensics, cybercrime, financial crime and intelligence analysis.""Last year, it received more than $7 million from the Justice Department to further that mission. The same year, it also spent $50,000 to have Mollohan and one of his former staffers lobby Congress, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.The White Collar Crime Center did not answer emails sent to its media department. One of Mollohan's critics, former CREW director Melanie Sloan, didn't seem entirely surprised that Mollohan was now profiting from taxpayer dollars spent by the agency that never prosecuted him.""It's no surprise that he's a lobbyist, but it's kind of ironic that this would be the job that he'd get,"" Sloan said. She added that perhaps Mollohan's avoidance of a white-collar prosecution gave him special expertise in the field, much the way hackers become advisers to the government.""You can't call him a criminal since he wasn't prosecuted, but someone who appears to have engaged in white-collar crime might well be able to offer advice as to how to investigate similar misconduct,"" Sloan said.An email to Nelson Mullins, the firm listed on Mollohan's lobbying disclosure forms, also was not immediately returned.

Is this what we've come to?How many of you can look at these pictures and honestly say you haven't spent a few nights in one of these compromising positions? Are we getting greater titillation from our tech at bedtime than the lovers we lay next to? What has happened to the days of screen-free intimacy? This is precisely the message artist Rachel Lee Hovnanian was getting at with her genius photographic series and video installation called Foreplay from her exhibition Plastic Perfect. ""In my work, I explore how technology affects intimacy through installation, photography and sculpture. A curated online life may appear to be better than real life, and this has become a universal issue."" Hovnanian says, ""now we can be with someone next to us and at the same time be with someone else 5,900 miles away. All of this is exciting and very seductive. I felt it was important to take a hard look at the nature of this distraction--technology providing a gratifying false mindfulness.""I asked Hovnanian about the couples in these pictures. ""One of the couples is no longer together,"" she said. ""Perhaps technology pulled them apart--they remain a couple in Foreplay, forever online and distracted in bed."" I recently heard there's even a new word for people that don't take their tech devices to bed. They're called ""disconnectionists"" and are defined as a people who advocate spending time away from online activities, for mental, spiritual or sexual rejuvenation. Sounds good to me. So if you take your tech to bed and, like me, think these images are a little too close to home, you might want to try some tech-free couples therapy! As Hovnanian says, ""perhaps we need time to pause and look at technology's impact on intimacy, and examine the resulting loss of intimacy that we have."" I agree and I'm up for that but before I slip into something sexy and crawl under the covers for a snuggle, just give me a second to check my Instagram feed and return some tweets.

I can't help but reflect on how similar his journey seems to be to the one I traveled only a few short years ago. However, there is one big difference.",2015-04-28,2015-04-07-1428408373-6753992-ScreenShot20150301at7.43.02AM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-07-1428408373-6753992-ScreenShot20150301at7.43.02AM-thumb.png,"The secret was tearing me apart. I hid for so, so long. Not only from others, but also from myself. I could not even admit it to myself. I got to be an expert in hiding, denying and making excuses. I learned that this is a very common experience for people like me, who are transgender.My inner experience was really an inner war that I describe in the introduction of my book, No! Maybe? Yes! Living My Truth:A part of me kept screaming, 'Be a Man!'For those of us who come to understand, and accept that we must transition gender to find inner peace, we know that we are faced with finally telling our ""secret."" It's hard to describe to those who do not experience it. We can watch how others perform their own ""coming out,"" but each of us will have to find our own path. There is no other way. For me, the physical changes were already happening. I was the old guy with the ponytail growing. The day I came into work with my ears pierced everyone made some comment. That only lasted a single day and was attributed to my ""mid-life crisis."" I laughed with them on the outside, but was a nervous wreck on the inside. Even so, I knew I had put another check on the transition checklist. I started taking hormones and my body was changing. The tight t-shirts were eliminated from my work clothes and replaced by baggy shirts and sweaters. I purposefully went for electrolysis on Friday evenings, so my face would heal before going back to work on Monday mornings. I managed like this for almost 2 years.I had a date for my facial surgery -- April 28, 2011. I knew I would be out of work for four weeks healing, so I had to start sharing my secret. It was time. I had a plan and a timeline. I always recommend this to anyone transitioning. First, I told the diversity team and human resources -- then senior management followed by confiding my secret to about a dozen peer level managers. The first time was excruciatingly difficult, but it got easier with each person. When I left work to have my surgery I didn't tell all the coworkers what was going on. That was handled the week before I returned with an HR training class held for around 200 people. I was told it went well. Looking back now, I can certainly say my experience returning to work was positive and amazing. I was fortunate to have the help I got at work. ...We now have seen ""The Interview"" with Bruce Jenner. I can't help but reflect on how similar his journey seems to be to the one I traveled only a few short years ago. However, there is one big difference.When I started to share my secret, every single person was surprised. No one had guessed, or expected me to announce I would be transitioning my gender. Some got it and some did not, but they all professed support. This was a giant relief and helped relieve my internal shame.  I am sure that the screening of the Interview was a huge relief for Jenner. I know because I too have walked in those shoes. The path is not easy, internally or externally, but it is a journey that so many of need to travel. ...After I transitioned, I started to run workplace trainings just like the ones that were done at my company when I transitioned. Over the past few years, I have had the opportunity to train hundreds of people to help them understand what the transition journey is like. When we see someone transition, it is often after many years of hiding and struggling to find self-acceptance. There are stages most people go through to transition. In 2004, Aaron H. Devor, defined these stages in his paper, Witnessing and Mirroring: A Fourteen-Stage Model of Transsexual Identity Formation. I've shared an info graphic I've developed for my teaching that shows these stages and the transition timeline. It's clear to see there's a lot of internal hiding for many of us before we accept our truth -- long before the actual transition ""event."" It's critical to note that the ""event"" is far from the end of the journey for any of us. Perhaps if Jenner does indeed announce his transgender journey, this will give us a better sense of his timeline and the path he has traveled. I suspect, that just like me and many of us who have found the courage to share our secret, Jenner will reveal he has been on his journey for far longer than anyone may know. Perhaps no one will be surprised given the exhaustive public scrutiny that began when he grew his ponytail and pierced his ears.   ###  Grace Stevens is a transgender woman who transitioned at the age of 64 and holds a Masters Degree in Counseling Psychology.

Termed #momishere and #nofilter30, Sprout is encouraging mothers everywhere to simply stop taking pictures of just their kids, and jump in the picture with them. It's a movement to inspire moms to embrace the imperfect, and capture ourselves with our children living everyday regular lives, even if they are messy, as real life can be. Leading the campaign again this year is actress and blogger Michele Lepe better known as Nina, on Sprout's The Good Night Show. When asked why she got involved with such a campaign, Lepe didn't hesitate to share her excitement for a movement that has the ability to empower women as mothers. ""It's all about supporting and inspiring mothers to come out from behind the camera and be in the picture."" Lepe said. And she is not alone. A recent viral post about Moms Getting in the Picture drew hundreds of thousand of readers, some with very emotional reactions. Many were commenting that they are never in real pictures anymore, and often are not comfortable with their appearance, thus hesitating to get in front of the camera. The #momishere and #nofilter30 campaign seeks to encourage mothers to let go of their insecurities, and embrace everyday parenting moments with their kids and snap a picture while doing so. ""This is a wonderful opportunity to not only make memories together, but to capture them in photos for my kids."" Lepe said. As for moms who shy away, she says, ""Your children love you unconditionally. They don't see your flaws. They see love. It's important for them to not see us self-conscious."" Lepe has been snapping pictures of her and her children since the#momishere campaign started on April 11, and will continue to do so everyday until it ends on Mother's Day, May 11. The 30 day challenge is still well under way, and Sprout is even giving away prizes to those who participate. Moms only need to share their daily, candid photos on Instagram and Twitter with the #momishere or #nofilter hashtag to be entered. ""This has motivated me to not only capture more pictures of myself with my children, but also actually upload my pictures to be made into prints, and possibly photo books that my children can enjoy for years to come."" Lepe continues, ""It's not about perfection and posing. It's about real moments, and I want those memories for my kids."" For more information on how you can join the campaign, visit Mom Is Here.

The play focuses on the experiences of refugees seeking protection in a foreign land from the points of view of two characters, a Nigerian girl who has taken the name Little Bee, and Sarah, an English journalist and young mother. Little Bee was adapted and directed by Book-It Founding Co-Artistic Director Myra Platt from the novel that was featured in the Seattle Public Library's 2011 Seattle Reads program.The play begins with Little Bee recounting her journey to England and being held at a refugee detention center for nearly two years, but as it unfolds, the horrors she has had to endure are revealed, as is the connection between her life path and Sarah's. Throughout this complicated story, characters lives intertwine with great passion and compassion, and all this is portrayed in just under three hours.Opening night could have easily been a progressive political rally with an audience filled with liberals, including Congressman Jim McDermott. That seems very appropriate as the show really focuses in on refugees, an issue that is currently in the news.To help audiences understand the issue even more experience, Book-It is partnering with Northwest International Refugee Project (NWIRP) and Refugee Women's Alliance of Washington (ReWA) whose representatives will lead pre-and post-show discussions around the issues of asylum seekers and refugees as it relates to our community and to the events in the novel.

10,MEDIA,Why The New York Times Is Naming Names In National Security Stories,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-york-times-drone-security_n_7155844.html,,2015-04-28,"The New York Times building is shown Wednesday, Oct. 21, 2009 in New York. The New York Times Co. is reporting a loss for the most recent quarter. It was hurt by one-time charges and the continuing ad slump. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c6dc2400003200567f9e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK –- The New York Times reported across the top of Sunday’s front page that Congress is doing little to oversee the CIA’s targeted killing program. In the process, the paper identified three high-ranking CIA officials with key roles in secret drone operations. The CIA asked the Times to withhold the names in its report, a request that executive editor Dean Baquet told The Huffington Post on Monday that he took seriously, but decided not to honor. Baquet said the officials are not undercover agents carrying out clandestine operations in the field, but rather figures with significant roles in ""one of the major issues in modern American warfare."" The CIA is now playing a ""quasi-military role"" through the drone program, a departure from its traditional functions that deserves scrutiny. In order to debate the program, he said, the public needs to know who is making key decisions. In addition, as the Times wrote in its article, the CIA officials' ""roles are known to foreign governments and many others.""“It would have been weird to not name the guys who run it,” Baquet said. “They’re not undercover. They’re not unknown. They’re sort of widely known.”A CIA spokesman declined to comment to The Huffington Post. Baquet's decision shows the news organization's increasing willingness to push back against government requests to withhold information, unless officials provide specific reasons why doing so may damage national security. In the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, major news organizations, like The Times, routinely were pressured by the Bush administration to withhold information on national security grounds. The Times also complied with requests during the first four years of the Obama administration. The paper didn't reveal the CIA ties of a man involved in a shooting in Pakistan, details of the Benghazi attack, the existence of a secret drone base in Saudi Arabia, and the names of some “widely known” CIA officials. In August 2013, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told then-Times executive editor Jill Abramson that she’d have blood on her hands if the paper published terrorists’ names on two intercepted cables. The Times withheld the information, which McClatchy revealed two days later. But last year, the Times reported that the U.S. government was considering a drone strike against an American citizen in Pakistan, even after the government had asked editors not to identify the location. Washington bureau chief Carolyn Ryan told The Huffington Post at the time that government ""requests to withhold information have become almost blanket policy.""Baquet acknowledged Monday that the press “was sometimes too quick to withhold information at the request of the government” in recent years. But that has changed, Baquet said, since national security disclosures through WikiLeaks and former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden “kicked off a big debate about surveillance and privacy.” Also, he said, “it’s become clearer over time that a huge percentage of foreign policy is now conducted in secret.”“I think that it puts more pressure on us to break down these secrets and make them public to people,” Baquet added. “It puts more pressure on us not to hold stuff back. I think the secrecy is now part of the story.”In Sunday’s report, the Times identified Michael D’Andrea, a former head of the CIA counterterrorism center, as “architect of the targeted killing program.” While D’Andrea has managed a large bureaucracy at CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, and his identity was revealed last year online, his name remains classified. For that reason, the CIA has long requested that news organizations refrain from publishing it. Other news organizations have honored this request in the past. In 2012, The Washington Post profiled D’Andrea, detailing his conversion to Islam, chain-smoking, and “dark-suited wardrobe of an undertaker,” but used the pseudonym “Roger.” The CIA official’s name was first revealed last year on Cryptocomb, a website that publishes information about the agency. But it wasn't widely repeated in the media. Last month, Gawker’s John Cook asked why The Washington Post wasn’t publishing D’Andrea's name in a more recent story that referenced him. Cook argued that the name of such a high-level official at Langley, even if he technically still given undercover status, should be made public for the sake of accountability. Baquet said the Times would not reveal names in a gratuitous way, but Sunday's drone story demanded it. “The whole story was about accountability,” he said. “In a story about accountability, how could you not mention the guys who run the program?”While mainstream news organizations may not follow Gawker’s lead in publishing still-classified names, a front-page Times story has the potential to open the floodgates and prompt establishment outlets to do so. Baquet said he’s “not on a crusade to get these names published” by other media and suggested that news organizations should have their own discussions. At least one TV network was still withholding the names on Monday morning. When Times reporter Matt Apuzzo, who co-wrote the CIA drone story, appeared on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe,” co-host Mika Brzezinski signaled at the start that the segment wouldn’t veer into the agents’ identities. “There’s a couple of different angles on this story,” Brzezinski said. ""We’re going to not name names here.”"

Here are five reasons we love the big guy so much:1. He's a silver fox if we ever saw one. Come on now, seriously: Have you ever seen a better head of hair on a guy his age? If so, we are going to insist on photographic evidence, so please post one in the comments below or we simply won't believe you. In our view, Leno is the original silver fox -- yes, yes, we know his hair is white -- and he wears a modern pompadour like nobody's business.2. He sets the bar high for guys with strong jaws. Leno’s distinctively large chin has been his trademark. In fact, the title of his 1996 autobiography was ""Leading with my Chin."" He discusses his jaw in the book, noting that the medical name for the condition is mandibular prognathism and that he could undergo surgery to reset his mandible, but didn't relish the idea of a long recovery period with his jaws wired shut. While some might not call him handsome in the George Clooney way, the guy is clearly comfortable in his own imperfect skin. Nothing says confidence like a strong jaw.3. He has good taste in cars. An avid car collector, Leno has about 890 cars and motorcycles that he houses in Burbank, Calif. He is frequently seen tooling around Los Angeles freeways in sports cars, convertibles and vintage autos. He bought his first car at age 14 -- a 30-year-old Ford truck for $350. 4. And even better taste in women. He and his wife Mavis have been married since 1980 -- without scandal. Mavis Leno, a feminist who keeps a low profile, works to promote the causes of women globally. 5. He knew how to quit when he was ahead. Leno hosted NBC's The Tonight Show with Jay Leno from 1992 to 2009. In 2009, he took a stab at a primetime talk show, which lasted just seven months before being cancelled. Much to our delight (perhaps a delight not shared by Conan O'Brien), Leno returned to hosting The Tonight Show until last year when Jimmy Fallon took over; Leno hosted 4,610 episodes in total and left as the king of late-night TV. In ""retirement,"" Leno averages about 200 performances a year.Happy birthday, Jay. You've still got it. Like Us On Facebook |   Follow Us On Twitter | "

The Sunday morning keynote was entitled, Diane Ravitch in Conversation with AFT's Randi Weingarten and NEA's Lily Eskelsen Garcia.The Sunday keynote was not arranged to accommodate audience questions.Not a problem.At the end of the session, I was briefly able to interview American Federation of Teachers (AFT) President Randi Weingarten regarding her September 8, 2014, robocall in support of New York governor Andrew Cuomo's running mate, now-lieutenant governor Kathy Hochul.I caught Weingarten as she was greeting members of the audience, so when I use the term, ""interview,"" I mean that it was my intention to interview her regarding the robocal, and I did so in the moment, without any warning to Weingarten.I walked up to the stage and asked, ""September 8th, the robocall you did in support of Kathy Hochul: Do you admit that your actions directly contributed to the re-election of Andrew Cuomo?""Weingarten responded, ""No...yes... no. They were separate items on the ballot in the primary.""Me: ""So a vote for Hochul was not a vote for Cuomo given that Hochul was Cuomo's running mate?""Weingarten: ""No. They were separate on the ballot.""Me: ""One more question: Was it the intention of the Democratic National Party to use the robocall for Hochul as back-door support for Cuomo?""Weingarten: ""No.""However.On May 21, 2014, Cuomo chose Hochul as his running mate, and on that day, the Democratic ticket was considered ""complete"":MELVILLE, N.Y. -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo on Wednesday (May 21) named a former congresswoman from Buffalo to be his running mate, a move that completes the Democratic ticket and underscores his courtship of western New York.So. Even though Hochul was listed separately on the ballot in the primary, Weingarten acknowledged in her September 8, 2014, robocall that she was performing the call on behalf of the Democratic Party- and the Democratic Party considered Hochul to complete the Cuomo re-election ticket.Here is Weingarten's full script, compliments of Ken Lovett of the New York Daily News:Hi, this is Randi Weingarten- you may know me as the president of the American Federation of Teachers but I'm calling today as a fellow Democrat and delegate to the Democratic National Committee, to urge you to vote for Kathy Hochul for Lieutenant Governor in Tuesday's Democratic Primary.All of that Democratic Party time, effort, and money to promote a lieutenant governor, the official with the lesser power.Indeed, Hochul has no power to override Cuomo's push for punitive education reform. And it is highly likely that if she were to choose to publicly contradict Cuomo's teacher hatred, she would not last long as his lieutenant.True, the lieutenant governor of New York has some prescribed duties (e.g., president of the state senate; serving on the court in impeachment trials; sitting on various state boards). Nevertheless, unless the governor chooses to assign additional duties, then the lieutenant governor could just be a ""spare"" governor ""just in case"" something happens to the governor.I even found that two former New York lieutenant governors, Alfred DelBello and Mary Anne Krupsak, resigned because the governors under whom they served (Mario Cuomo and Hugh Carey, respectively) did not ""give them enough to do.""Thus, it is safe to surmise that the lieutenant governors are governor-dependent, and they know so.But let us return to the idea that Weingarten tries to promote: That since the governor and lieutenant governor are separate ballot issues primary elections in New York, then promoting Cuomo's running mate does not necessarily translate into support for Cuomo.I researched back to the 1950s and could find no instance in which a New York governor and lieutenant governor who both received the Democratic nomination did not both make it successfully through the primary and end up on the same Democratic ticket.Given Cuomo's publicized hatred for New York teachers, it is logical to conclude that former-teacher Hochul could be used as a convenient token to draw career teacher support for Cuomo, and that both the Democratic Party and Weingarten surely knew as much.After his re-election, Cuomo declared his own teacher evaluation system weak and pushed for one designed to fire more teachers. Also, via his power over the state budget, he is able to hijack New York education decisions. In a curious decision, NY Regents chancellor Merryl Tisch is apparently defying Cuomo's intent to rid New York of more of its teachers.But when it comes to Cuomo's intentional actions to tourniquet public education in New York, there is no defiance from Hochul. And that ""pro-public-school Hochul"" whom Weingarten advertised in that September 8th, 2015, campaign phone call is showing herself to be one of the Cuomo faithful. She publicly supports Cuomo's teacher eval plans, and she criticizes New York parents' opting their children out of state testing, calling such actions a ""disservice"" because of potential ""consequences in the future.""Hochul also supports Cuomo's efforts to expand charter schools in New York.Thus, she is being what New Yorkers might expect of a lieutenant governor: She is parroting the wishes of the governor......the governor who, like Hochul, was officially endorsed by the Democratic Party......and who ended up being given a poorly-defended, robocall-boost-by-proxy from AFT President Randi Weingarten.Modified version originally posted 04-27-15 at deutsch29.wordpress.comSchneider is a southern Louisiana native, career teacher, trained researcher, and author of the ed reform whistle blower, A Chronicle of Echoes: Who's Who In the Implosion of American Public Education.She also has her second book available on pre-order, Common Core Dilemma: Who Owns Our Schools?, due for publication June 12, 2015."

Follow Candice on Instagram and Twitter @candicekp and on Facebook at facebook.com/candicepattonIt's hard not to love Candice Patton. I tried and failed. What about you? Oh! Did you see Part I of this interview?  I was in the mood for some fun questions. You know, Candice doesn't even need an introduction. Is anyone even reading this intro or did you skip right to the questions? :)You majored in theater, yes? Is theater something you would love to do more of in the future or are you more of a TV/Film girl?I would love love love to do theatre. It's how I started and essentially it's my heart. I think going back to theatre can only strengthen my work.I would love to do a non-musical Broadway or Off-Broadway play.Cats or dogs?I'm growing to appreciate cats, but I am definitely a dog person. I just love them. I want one, but can't seem to commit to having one full time with this job and traveling all the time. I hope one day I can make the leap. I think having a dog would change a lot of things for me in a good way.What's wrong with the phrase ""off the chain?""Hahahah! Nothing is wrong with it, if you just got out of your time machine from 1999. (I'm looking at you, Dad). [Author's Note: Awwww!]What will you do during The Flash hiatus?I really hope to keep working. Film is something I have my eye on and hope timing wise I can find something just right. If not, there are a couple of conventions I will go to in Europe and maybe travel while I'm there. And of course I have to get some of that lovely California sun.Have you done conventions?I've been to San Diego Comic Con, but that was really only to introduce The Flash to the world. I don't think that was a typical convention. I do have one planned this May in Birmingham, UK. It will be great to be face to face with the fans. I'm excited about that.What did your family say to you when you said you were moving to L.A. for an acting job? What did they say when you told them you wanted to be an actor? At what age did you make the decision to act for a living?Well I didn't have an acting job when I moved to LA. I was just naive enough to think that moving to LA was the next step after college. My parents were really supportive. My dad always told me to do what I love and I'll never work a day in my life. I was NEVER once told to consider anything but my dreams. It's probably one of the greatest gifts my parents gave me, because it never occurred to me to do something other than what I loved.I was thinking about being an actor from a young age. Around 2nd or 3rd grade I remember watching I Love Lucy and being enamored with Lucille Ball. I was so enamored by her and it was then that it occurred to me that I want to do whatever it was that she was doing. As soon as I could I was in school plays every year and it never really stopped. I don't know that I ever made the decision to be an actor for a living, it was just a natural progression from being in plays, to studying theatre in college, to moving to LA. I just followed my passion and one day I started getting paid for it. I'm really lucky to have found something I loved at such a young age.You played Bernard Avery's widow on an episode of Rizzoli & Isles. At the time, did you have any idea how huge a following this show had? Tell us about your time on the set of Rizzoli & Isles.No, I was unaware of the following that show had. That was a really great experience for me. It was one of the few really meaty guest star roles I've had and it was challenging to do that sort of work on camera. We, as actors, so rarely get to practice scenes with emotionally high stakes under the pressure cooker of a TV set, having to go take after take, with all sort of distractions to contend with around us.Have you read any of The Flash fan fiction with Iris? What are your thoughts on fan fiction?There's Iris fan fiction? That's news to me. I try to stay off the parts of the internet which pertain to me or my character to a large degree. But, I think fan fiction is a great way for people to express themselves and storylines they want to see. I think it's a wonderful creative outlet! I believe I wrote / read some fan fiction when I was a teenager. It was fun!Be sure to read Part I of my interview with Candice Patton!"

But whether or not you're a supporter of high-stakes testing, the fact remains that for now, these assessments exist; so perhaps the more important inquiry to pursue is how do teachers balance preparation for high stakes assessments with teaching and learning in their classrooms? That's the question we put to our Top 12 Global Teachers' team this month. Here are their answers:Joe Bower (@joe_bower) from Canada points to a potential future mode of assessment. He has already swapped tests and grades in his classroom and replaced them with projects and performances collected in student portfolios. He still teaches for tests as much as he needs to but doesn't let this overwhelm overall learning. More from Joe here. Craig Kemp (@mrkempnz) based in Singapore (which has a world-renowned education system, ranking 2nd on the PISA 2012 Reading, Math and Science tests) says about testing that he has seen ""the negative result of this pressure on students every day."" He talks about how the emphasis in his classroom is on learning through real world experience rather than on cramming for high stakes tests. In the end, this helps students to excel across the board, since it encourages them to love learning. More from Craig here.Angela Watson (@Angela_Watson) (recommended by Vicki Davis - @coolcatteacher) warns us that ""no matter how others may choose to evaluate your work, you can't define your own success as a teacher according to whether students pass a standardized test. That's a recipe for frustration and burnout."" Angela recommends focusing on the tried and true goals of working to make a difference and igniting passion. More from Angela here.Karyn McWhirter (recommended by Pauline Hawkins - @PaulineDHawkins) notes that ""if an assessment is not a quality thinking/communicating task, then giving it to students is a waste of time."" She has found that preparing students for AP tests is helping them to learn analysis, argumentation, and communication. The problem for her is not with testing at large but the types of exams and what they are testing for. More from Karyn here.Todd Finley (@finleyt) believes ""high-stakes standardized tests (HSSTs) undermine effective practice, especially when we treat testing as content rather than just one of many ways of understanding what learners need."" Todd shares his ""test prep tips"" but recommends that teachers trust their teacher-researcher brains by experimenting ""with different test-prep activities, analyzing the results, and making creative adjustments."" More from Todd here.Luke Reynolds (recommended by Adam Steiner - @steineredtech) thinks students are ""more than just test scores,"" and hence focuses less on the test and more on overall classwork. He's not sure if this is too idealistic, given the importance placed on testing elsewhere in the culture, but in the end, he expects that his students' test scores won't suffer. More from Luke here.Richard Wells (@iPadWells) based in New Zealand notes that the test prep playing field is out of whack, in favor of the middle class. This has to change, however it involves not just teachers and schools but also the government making changes - so we can move towards an environment of teamwork rather than competition. More from Richard here.Chris Bacon (recommended by Adam Steiner - @steineredtech) doesn't have a magical answer. However he comments that ""rather than teaching to the test, the most successful schools teach through the test."" Chris thinks that there are definitely ways to balance test prep with overall classroom needs. The key, he says, is to emphasize critical thinking, even when doing test prep. More from Chris here.Kelly Meehan (recommended by Adam Steiner - @steineredtech) notes that as early as preschool, high stakes testing has inundated the curriculum in schools. She thinks we should be asking ourselves these questions: ""What is the quality of the teaching and learning happening inside our classrooms?
