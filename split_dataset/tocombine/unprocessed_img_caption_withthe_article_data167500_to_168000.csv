0,PARENTING,Visitors After the Baby? 10 Tips for New Parents,"Amy Morrison, Contributor
Blogger, Pregnant Chicken",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/newborns_us_5b9cac89e4b03a1dcc80c5ff,"The best thing you can do with visitors, a new baby, and I suppose life in general, is just roll with it.",2013-01-02,Mom Smiling at Baby Over Playpen Railing. Horizontally framed shot.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cac892200005700d954fa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Do you feel special when you're pregnant? Well, step aside, Lady, because a baby is here and people love babies. The dilemma that comes with having this little rock star in your home now is that billions of people will want to come visit it. Some will be helpful, some will not. So here are a few handy tips I've picked up along the way so you're able to show your magnificent little miracle off to the world like Simba in The Lion King.Don't let anyone stay with you that you can't cry in front of or you can't tell to ""shut up""There may be a few people that offer to stay with you when the baby comes. This can be a Godsend or a sh!tshow. Really think about that person and how much you want them to see behind the curtain. You may be too tired to delicately say, ""I know she's not latching properly, but I'm just trying to get the hang of it,"" and instead say, ""See off? You need to f#ck right to it!""Decide carefully about who you want to be around 24/7 when your inner filter isn't working at full capacity. Spread out the visitors.People love to see the baby immediately. That, or they feel obliged to see the baby immediately. Either way, try to spread them out as much as you can so you can get settled and enjoy everyone's company long after the fanfare typically dies down. Try not to book too far in advance either, you seriously may feel great the day after you give birth and feel like a back alley crack whore by week two.Go to people that you think will overstay their welcome -- don't have them come to youSometimes, this really isn't their fault. I was one of these people before I had kids because I had no idea how tiring a newborn can be. I would sit there gabbing on about some new bar I'd been to while staring into the vacant doll-like eyes of my best friend holding her newborn. I'm sure she wanted to tell me to shut my cake hole and get the hell out of her house, but just didn't have the energy.These are the people you should meet for a coffee or go to their place.First of all, newborns are very portable because they eat, sleep and poop and that's about it, so take advantage of this window when you can cart them anywhere and they don't care. Secondly, it's all on your terms when to pull the chute and you won't have to drop the little hints that go unnoticed. By the way, some of these single people, elderly uncles, etc. are fantastic to be around because they are often just as self-absorbed as a newborn and it's strangely refreshing to talk about something other than babies sometimes.Put them to workSome people are just itching to help when you have a baby and you know what? Let them. These people are like damn border collies and if you don't give them a task, they get destructive and are liable to chew the leg off a chair or worse, start throwing stuff out. Let them do dishes, tidy up, clean the bathroom, take out the garbage, take your other kids to the park, whatever. Don't want them seeing your gross underwear? Throw it in your closet and let them deal with the rest of the pile.Just leave *your* to-do list out and if they ask if they can help, just point them to it and tell them to help themselves if they feel like it. Not everyone is comfortable around babies but really want to help, so give them the satisfaction of doing something for you and just enjoy it and thank them profusely so they don't start installing a sprinkler system.Tag teamRemember the first point? That kind of applies to visitors as well. If they aren't the kind of person you can lose it in front of, then have a buffer person with you to entertain or deflect if you need to pull a batsmoke. Just have these people over when your partner, close relative or friend is around in case you need to excuse yourself for an hour to cry on the bed for no particular reason (I did this... twice).Partner plays the bad copIf you think you're second string to the baby, just imagine how your partner feels. This is his chance to shine because I can gua-ran-tee you that there will be some tricky situations when visitors come; like the cousin that announces he's just getting over the flu in passing conversation while holding your 3-day-old infant. Or the great aunt that insists that the baby needs to be brought out in a snow storm to meet her bridge club. Or the nephew that drops by and could ""really go for a sandwich.""Dad (or partner, or sidekick), it is your job to step up and say, ""Oh, hell no."" You know why? Because everybody thinks a protective father is cute and everybody thinks a protective mother is nuts, so do everybody a favour and unhinge.This is also a perfect opportunity for an Al Pacino impression. Have them bring foodAs my friend's Jamaican grandmother used to say, ""Don't come wid you two long han"". Which loosely translated to don't show up empty-handed. Most visitors like to bring something whether it's a gift, flowers, etc., but food is always such a great thing to receive when you're tired and just learning the ropes with a baby and people are usually more than happy to help. (If you're dealing with people who think you should be honoured with their presence -- see point 3.)Have them pop it over or sit down and share it with them, either way, they get a baby fix and you get some lasagna. I say win-win.Treat it like an Out-of-Office Reply*Sometimes people think it's nice to pop in to see how a new mother is doing if they haven't had an immediate response to a message they left an hour ago. This actually isn't too bad for the people you can tell to ""shut up"" because you can tell them if it isn't a good time and their feelings won't get hurt. For the rest of the population, it is not cool to arrive unannounced at a new parents front door because there is no telling what kind of Stephen King nightmare is going on that day. To avoid these awkward moments, I like to treat it like a vacation notification. Change your voicemail and your email to let people know you're kind of off the grid. It may seem like a no-brainer to you, but some people feel the need to constantly ""check in."" Just have an auto-reply that says, ""Thanks for your email (call). We're just getting the hang of parenthood so forgive us if it takes a little longer than usual to get back to you. Don't worry, we're just fine and loving every minute of it.""I know this may be a little over the top and may feel like the equivalent of adding the dog's name to Christmas cards (I love that actually), but it's an easy way of letting them know they've been heard. *Obviously, if you're alone and live in the woods in wolverine country, disregard this advice and be grateful someone is checking to make sure the cat isn't eating your corpse.Pre-PrepDo you think Aunt Kelly is going to be a problem? Get your responses thought out NOW or start laying the groundwork NOW. If you think she's going to show up on your doorstep the day you give birth then start telling her the story of a co-worker's mother-in-law that showed up the day she gave birth and how awful it was and how you're so lucky that your family just gets that you need a couple of days to settle in. Get an email ready saying, ""Aunt Kelly, we can't wait for you to see the new baby! I'm just getting the hang of it so can I give you a call when I come up for air so you can come over and meet her?"" then hit *send* when she fires off the first email.Go with the flowDoes Aunt Kelly still show up? Does your Mother-in-Law that you've never met fly in from the Ukraine and set herself up on your couch? Does your sister drop in everyday to tell you about the disgusting brunch she had or everything about her wicked pilates instructor?Roll with it and save your energy like a solar street light on a dimming switch. Ask Aunt Kelly to hold the baby while you go have a shower. Say ""Diakuju"" when your mother-in-law makes dinner, then go lie down with the baby. Tell your sister she needs a f#cking punch in the throat then apologize and blame it on your hormones while savoring the good vent.The best thing you can do with visitors, a new baby, and I suppose life in general, is just roll with it.Even though you are now regarded as the remaining husk that brought this precious, perfect gift into the world -- you will be asked how you feel as a courtesy but no one gives much of a sh!t how you are now, so try not to ramble -- it's still your show, honey. So remember, choose your visitors wisely and enjoy the little star that everyone wants to see shine."

Huh)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cad733c00005b0009dacd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There's no better way to see the ebb and flow in the world of aviation than to go back and review the events of the past year. As I look at what I saw fit to write about in 2012, I appreciate the unconventional approach some airlines have taken in response to the rapid changes in the industry.Kudos to Delta Air Lines and Air New Zealand for flying solo into uncharted territory. Delta decided to buy an oil refinery to gain control of its largest and most unpredictable expense. Air New Zealand added financial services to what it offers its passengers with a combination debit/loyalty/cash card.Who can say if these novel approaches will accomplish what the airlines desire? But it's an admirable off-our butts and-onto-the-field approach during challenging times for airlines.In the admit-when-you're-wrong-and-revise-the-plan category, Alan Joyce the CEO of Australia's flag carrier put an end to years of Gulf-airline bashing and made peace with Tim Clark, Emirates president and one of the cartographers of the new map of the airline world. Qantas and Emirates are now running code shares out of Dubai. Without a doubt that's the first of what will be many steps former foes will take together.Great Quotes Meantime, Turkish has been quietly and steadily adding routes, airplanes and most importantly passengers. It ends the year with flights to an astonishing 214 destinations. During a interview earlier this month in Istanbul, Temel Kotil promised more of the same with this great quote: ""All the branches growing, growing growing, when a hard time comes you cut the branches. This is adaptation,"" he explained. ""If you don't have enough profit, you need to cut, if there is profit, it is okay to grow.""And growing is what it is doing, tripling the number of passengers over the past decade.Another area where the tree is growing and branches are thick with fruit is Latin America. The Star Alliance is ready to pick some of it, too having added Panama's Copa and Colombia's Avianca. American Airlines claims to own the region with more flights to more destinations, but there's more than a caffeine buzz jazzing the marketplace, as Joseph Mohan, a Copa veep explained when we met this summer in Panama City.""There's been a decoupling of the economic survival of Latin America from the United States,"" he explained. ""Latin America has grown organically, it's grown within itself."" In the past it was always a question of which U.S.-based company would play a role in regional development, Joe explains, but now ""there is much more intra-Latin American commerce,"" with a consequent boom in the continent's aviation industry.Hanging on to its edge in South America is just one of many challenges facing American, now one full year into its bankruptcy and reorganization effort and two quarters into a destination is has not frequently visited -- profitability. Will American finally say yes to US Airways marriage proposal? Tom Horton's answer to that question would be a great quote. But sorry to say, he's not talkin'. Great Memories The glory days of aviation were illustrated with disappointing mediocrity this year during the short-lived television series Pan Am, which was off the air by the second month of 2012. The show triggered many great memories, but that airline is no more relevant to today's world of air travel than the rotary dial telephone is to an iPhone. More inspiring than fiction-based on fact, was the celebration of Al Blackman's 70 years of service to American Airlines which was held this July at the airline's maintenance hangar in New York.Blackman started working at the age of 16 and he's built up some memories after so many years turning a wrench. To mark the day, American took Blackman, friends and journalists up for a spin above the city in an airplane Blackman was practically old enough to have worked on when it was new, the Flagship Detroit DC-3.Great Books Knowing that the past is past, doesn't keep us from enjoying the stories of how we got to where we are today. In fact with Skygirls, the opposite is true. Bruce McAllister and Stephan Wilkinson's heavily illustrated account of the evolution of the cabin attendant from uniformed nurse to '60s-era miniskirt-wearing seductress to today's (mostly) gender neutral flight attendant is enlightening and funny. I liked the stories, I loved the photos. You will too. (My review is here.)Even knowing how the story ended, QF32, the story of the first almost-disaster aboard the world's largest jetliner, was a gripping read. Capt. Richard de Crespigny (can we please keep calling him ""Capt. Fantastic""?) the commander of the five men in the cockpit who helped guide the crippled Airbus A380 back to Singapore's Changi Airport after an uncontained engine failure writes with wit and personality. Richard includes enough details to make one understand why this event should be judged not on how well it turned out, but how close it came to tragedy. (My full review is here.)Before leaving for the International Air Transport Association's annual general meeting in Beijing this summer, I made time to read Greg Crouch's excellent China's Wings. Photos documenting some of the stories of the birth of commercial aviation in China in the '30s and '40s provide proof that these otherwise unbelievable events really took place. (My full review is here.)Don Chernoff is an engineer, an inventor and a frequent flyer who's interest in ""the original flying machines"" inspires every page of Wild Washington, photos of wildlife in and around Washington D.C. From the gull on the cover to the cormorant on the end paper, Don has captured the beauty, the tragedy and the mystery of natural flight. Is there a better way to end one year or begin the next than to spend some time pondering this earliest form of flight?"

3,DIVORCE,Women: Five Reasons Your Divorce Is Your Fault,"Laura Doyle, Contributor
New York Times Bestselling Author,  America's Most-Trusted Int...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-five-reasons-your-d_us_5b9ca89ce4b03a1dcc80a076,"Here are five ways that women unwittingly sabotage their marriages, along with the proven remedies for restoring the love and closeness you once shared.",2013-01-02,Portrait of an upset young woman lying separately from husband on the bed,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca89c240000310053490c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I teach intimacy skills, but not to couples and not to men. I only teach them to women because we are the ones who have the power to make our relationships intimate. When a woman learns intimacy skills, her relationship becomes passionate and peaceful in about two weeks. Clients often say, ""I feel like I have a new husband."" But he's not the one who changed -- she did, and then he responds to her differently.That's how it always is when a woman has a good guy. Of course, not all guys are good guys. If your husband is actively addicted to drugs, alcohol or gambling, or is physically abusive, or not capable of being faithful, yours is a divorce I endorse. Safety comes first and you're not safe in those situations because his compulsion will always come before you. But if he doesn't fall into one of those categories, he's a good guy -- not a perfect guy, but one you can have a wonderful relationship with when you learn the skills that contribute to intimacy.Below are five ways that women unwittingly sabotage their marriages, along with the proven remedies for restoring the love and closeness you once shared.1. Rejecting his efforts to make you happyHusbands and wives bring different strengths and desires to marriage. For women, feeling cherished and desired is vital. For a man, respect and sex are of utmost importance. Men also have a powerful drive to make their wives happy -- it contributes to their feeling of success.You might think that your husband is the exception -- that he doesn't care about delighting you -- but he may just be discouraged because he doesn't feel that he can please you. You have the power to transform your relationship by becoming pleasable, which means showing appreciation for his efforts instead of rejecting or dismissing them -- and by extension, him.When you reject his efforts because they aren't what you had in mind (e.g., a present that isn't what you want, cleaning that's not to your standards, or a compliment you don't agree with), there's nothing he can do to improve the situation, but there is something powerful you can do: receive graciously.Remedy: Try an experiment for the next two weeks: However small or imperfect his efforts, receive what your husband offers when he is trying to please or help you. Thank him for his thoughtfulness. Notice how quickly this creates more intimacy as you practice the skill of receiving graciously.2. Taking the same approach at home as you do at workWe women can create a gratifying culture of intimacy, if we know how. If all we've ever been taught is how to get ahead in school and career, but not how to foster intimacy, it's pretty hard to change hats when the work day is done and we want a loving, supportive home.At work we have to manage projects and staff, move the bottom line and get that promotion. At home the goals are different; we want to feel appreciated and wanted and get more help around the house. But if you treat your husband like an employee, he will rebel. Respecting your husband by saying what you want instead of telling him what to do gives him the opportunity to make you happy in a way that no amount of managing ever will.Remedy: For two weeks say what you want, but not what he should do or how he should do it. Be patient and allow him to find his own way of pleasing you. Remember, he wants to. Let him, and he will.3. Withholding sexMost men need sex more than women to feel intimate. You are his only source for that vital form of connecting, and when you withhold -- whether to punish or because you're exhausted -- you miss a chance to receive the intimacy that you both crave.Remedy: Over the next two weeks as you start experiencing more intimacy, consider making yourself available for sex at least once a week in support of your mutual goal of connecting.4. Initiating divorce when the problem isn't insurmountableWomen initiate between 66% and 90% of all divorces. You might think that's because men do things to make marriage untenable -- like cheat or hit them -- but I hear about women divorcing because he didn't help with the baby, he was emotionally unavailable, or because they grew apart. Countless women tell me they divorced because their husbands weren't capable of meeting their needs.When the women I work with learn intimacy skills, it changes the way they see a previous marriage. Some women tell me that they realize they were married to a good guy, but divorced because they lacked the skills to have a happy relationship. Sometimes it causes them enormous grief.It is heartbreaking to see marriages end because of a simple lack of skills. It's no different than seeing someone try to drive a car without a single lesson: A crash is inevitable, but it's preventable.Remedy: Consider taking divorce off the table just for the next two weeks, keeping in mind that intimacy needs safety to thrive. In my experience, any woman who has a good guy can bring her marriage back from the brink of divorce and transform it into a happy, loving relationship by practicing the intimacy skills. You can do the same.5. Waiting for him to improveYou might wonder why there's no article for men explaining what they can do to improve their marriages. Even if there was, you couldn't make your husband read it or do what it says. You can change yourself, and he will respond to you differently.Remedy: Instead of pleading, criticizing or demanding that your husband change, try the remedies above for two weeks.

But there was something so raw and truthful about this film that forced me to examine my role as a mother.",2013-01-01,"FILE - This publicity film image released by Universal Pictures shows actress Anne Hathaway portraying Fantine, a struggling, sickly mother forced into prostitution in 1800s Paris, in a scene from the screen adaptation of ""Les Miserables."" (AP Photo/Universal Pictures, Laurie Sparham, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9caa01250000350036288b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Eighteen months ago I did not hold the title ""mommy,"" but on this day I do. And, it was with this fairly new lens that I watched the movie Les Misérables. I was invited to a private screening with my girlfriend who is a makeup artist to celebrities. It was a treat to be a ""plus one"" for the night and I was looking forward to getting lost in the film and not my baby's teething dramas. But my protective motherhood gene reared its ugly head when Fantine, compellingly played by Anne Hathaway, hit the screen with all the pain and desperation only a mother could feel. With a heavy heart and hopeless, Fantine tries to figure out how to make money to care for her daughter. As a mother, I often wonder, ""What I would do for my baby?"" And the answer is, ""I would do anything."" Which is exactly what Fantine does with heart wrenching consequences. When Anne Hathaway sang ""I Dreamed a Dream"" as a mother completely desperate, ashamed, and broken, all I could do was hold my breath and silently weep. Because the truth is, if I was an unemployed, single parent who lived France in 1815, I, too, would sell my hair and all my other body parts to save my daughter. Throughout the epic tale, different characters reveal other aspects of motherhood with incredible clarity and honesty. In an early scene, Valjean, played by the talented Hugh Jackman, makes a commitment to Fantine regarding her daughter Cosette. His determination to protect this young girl is one of might and conviction. As I watched, I was reminded of my role as a mother and protector, a role that needs to be proactive. While other characters set the screen on fire with their heart-filled resolve, Éponine, who is played by Samantha Barks, subtly illustrates how her simple acts of kindness, protection, and care can be so easily ignored by the ones she loves. It is a beautiful, yet tragic reminder of how we can sometimes overlook the little things that others do for us. While watching her final scene, all I wanted to do was thank my mom for all the sacrifices she has made for me. One of the most delightful characters is Gavroche, a young boy who lives on the streets of Paris and steels more than just smiles. The boy, played by Daniel Huttlestone, reminded me of the optimism and spunk children have, but as with youth -- it's gone too soon. Throughout the movie I just wanted to reach out and hug him, protect him, and take him home (and give him a bath).As the music moves from powerful crescendos to dark valleys, each character took me through a labyrinth of emotions with such vengeance that it was hard to believe that Les Misérables is just a movie. I am not a film critic -- heck, this was the first movie I've seen in months. But there was something so raw and truthful about this film that forced me to examine my role as a mother. I was reminded that right now my daughter is young and unafraid, and her dreams are filled with hope and wonder. And that her world is a song, and the song is exciting -- even if it's ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" played 67 times in a row. So, as her mommy, I will do my best to keep her dreams alive."

But, as 2012 turned the corner into 2013, there was no shortage of violence. Several slayings marred the New Year's revelry in many of the nation's cities. The count of the dead has not yet been fully calculated, but it is quite apparent from the cases already making headlines that there was an almost immediate succession of violence that came as Father Time passed on his duties to the Baby New Year.PHILADELPHIA, PENNSYLVANIAThe ""City of Brotherly Love"" could easily be christened the city of bloodshed following the events of early 2013.Philly's first homicide occurred at about 12:30 a.m., when a 17-year-old boy was shot and killed. According to published reports, the shooting happened during an argument at a house party in West Philadelphia. No suspects in that case have been named.Roughly two hours later, an unidentified man was shot and killed in the Frankford section of the city. Authorities suspect the shooting occurred after a fight.A third shooting occurred in North Philadelphia at about 3 a.m. In that case three unidentified people were shot. One of the victims died at the hospital, according to police.Philly police are also searching for a suspect in a hit-and-run death that occurred near Presidential Boulevard early Tuesday. The name of the victim, a white man in his 50's, was not immediately released. Police said the suspect vehicle is a silver sedan, possibly a Nissan, with significant front-end damage.LANSING, MICHIGANThe ""Heart of Michigan"" made it approximately two hours into the New Year before its first homicide.According to Lansing police, one man died and four others were injured during a 2 a.m. fight at a north-side store. The fatality was a result of gun violence. Four others were injured and three of them are hospitalized in critical condition. Authorities have not yet identified the victims. However, they are reportedly all local residents in their 20's. No arrests have been made.CLEVELAND, OHIOCleveland's 1st homicide of the year happened at about 2:48 a.m., on the city's East Side. According to Cleveland police, they discovered the victim’s body on the porch of a Hilgert Ave. residence after they responded to a call of shots fired.The victim, according to the Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's office, is a black male. No further details have been released. PUEBLO, COLORADOAn exchange of gunfire between an unidentified man and Pueblo police resulted in a death at about 3 a.m. Tuesday.According to police, an officer was on patrol near 11th and Greenwood Ave., when he heard gunshots. The source of the gunfire led the officer to a suspicious vehicle and a pursuit ensued. The vehicle crashed a short distance down the road and several people reportedly exited the car and fled on foot.One of the suspects shot and injured the police officer. The officer returned fire, but the suspected shooter managed to escape. A responding unit encountered the alleged gunman on a nearby highway and the suspect was shot and killed by police.The officer who was shot is hospitalized in stable condition, according to local media reports.No further details have been released.INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANAThe ""Crossroads of America"" saw its first homicide victim of the New Year shortly before 5:30 a.m. Tuesday.According to Indianapolis police, a passerby spotted the body of a man in the doorway of a duplex residence near North Tibbs Ave.Authorities suspect the man was answering his door when he was shot and killed. The victim, identified only as a man in his 50's, was pronounced dead at the scene.No suspects or persons of interest have been named.AUGUSTA, GEORGIAAugusta also recorded its first homicide on Tuesday morning. Details remain sparse, but police say they discovered the body of Edward Yancey following a shooting in the parking lot at Club Fiasco at 2925 Peach Orchard Road.Yancey, 21, died from an apparent gunshot wound, police said.Investigators suspect the shooting was preceded by an argument that had initially occurred inside the establishment, but witnesses have reportedly indicated Yancey was an innocent bystander.TO BE CONTINUED...The above listed incidents are just a small snapshot of the violence that occurred around the country as American's wake up to 2013. A sum total of today's homicides – an unfortunate start to a fresh New Year -- have yet to be calculated and the count will no indubitably continue to rise steadily throughout the day."

As New Year's Day approached 150 years ago, all eyes were on President Abraham Lincoln in expectation of what he warned 100 days earlier would be coming _ his final proclamation declaring all slaves in states rebelling against the Union to be ""forever free."" A tradition began on Dec. 31, 1862, as many black churches held Watch Night services, awaiting word that Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation would take effect as the country was in the midst of a bloody Civil War. Later, congregations listened as the president's historic words were read aloud. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badd0ba3c000018010b4c5e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Abraham Lincoln, the tall president with the stovepipe hat, the full beard and the grief-stricken eyes, slipped away from the White House’s annual New Year’s celebration with a few members of his administration. Lincoln steadied his nerves, then his hands.After a few minutes, he took a pen, signed the Emancipation Proclamation and ushered in the beginning of the end of two and a half centuries of American chattel slavery, some of its attendant violence and human degradation. Exactly 150 years ago today, the Emancipation Proclamation -- a monumental document written on both sides of an ordinary sheet of White House paper -- declared slaves living in most of the South “forever free.” For many American adults, it’s also the moment when universal, legal freedom became a reality for an estimated 4 million black slaves. But scholars who have studied the document, Lincoln and Civil War history say the limited understanding of how slaves became free citizens led to a national habit of thinking about complex issues like race and equality simply, like finite challenges already wrestled with and resolved.“Of all the country’s foundational and key documents the Emancipation Proclamation may well be the most misunderstood,” said Eric Foner, a Columbia University historian and a leading Reconstruction, race and Lincoln scholars. “On the one hand, there are a healthy share of Americans who believe that Lincoln freed all the slaves with a stroke of his pen,” said Foner, who this year published “The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery.” “On the other, there is this cynical modern take that says Lincoln wasn’t interested in emancipation, that he took action for purely political reasons, for military reasons and this notion that not many slaves were actually freed. None of that is exactly true.” Lincoln was not the lone force behind emancipation but rather an essential part of a coalition of outspoken abolitionists that included free blacks and whites, said Lonnie G. Bunch III, director of the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture and one of the curators of the Smithsonian’s 150th Emancipation Proclamation anniversary exhibit. Lincoln also was responding to the unique pressure slaves brought to bear, said Bunch. From the very start of the war in South Carolina, slaves began running away more frequently and willingly, living in a state of legal limbo. What started with four slaves in Virgina given refuge in a Union-controlled fort, became hundreds and later thousands of slaves in areas just north of the Mason-Dixon line. In order to evade slave catchers, bounty-hunter like figures paid to find and return fugitive slaves to their masters empowered by federal law, some set up so-called “contraband” camps near Union Army encampments or outposts, said Bunche. One such camp grew in what is now Arlington Cemetery, just outside Washington, D.C.Some runaways also began to work for wages. They dug trenches and latrines, managed laundry and other tasks related to war. Later, when the Union Army began accepting black soldiers, some negotiated with commanding officers to bring their families along. That drive towards self-liberation was first documented about 30 years ago, said Bunch, but most people have no knowledge of how slaves helped bring down the institution.“I don’t say this to take anything away from Lincoln,” said Bunch, author of the 2010 book Call the Lost Dream Back: Essays on History, Race and Museums. “Ultimately, the Emancipation Proclamation, the 13th Amendment, none of it would have happened without Lincoln. But it’s also true neither would have happened without all these people and forces essentially saying something had to be done.” Lincoln, a life-long opponent of slavery who viewed human ownership as immoral but blacks as inferior, first ran for public office in his early 20s, Foner said. He came to national prominence nearly two decades later with a series of heated debates and public speeches calling for the still-growing nation to ban slavery in new states. Later, Lincoln became a public proponent of a gradual slave emancipation that would offer government-funded compensation to slave owners and essentially deport former slaves to Africa. By the time Lincoln signed the Emancipation Proclamation, he supported the idea of an uncompensated and broad emancipation. He publicly endorsed limited rights, including voting, for certain African Americans, Foner said.The Emancipation Proclamation changed the purpose of the war from restoring and preserving the Union to setting slaves free and defending principles like freedom and unity. “That evolution has somehow failed to permeate the nation’s thinking,” said Foner. “Instead, Lincoln has become iconic, the self-made man, the frontiersman, the moral politician guided by what is right or the Union’s military goals and this kind of uncommitted emancipator to others.”The collective value of the nation’s 4 million slaves sat between $3 and $4 billion in 1860, more than all the nation’s factories and railroads combined, Foner said. Any step to set the slaves free, and wipe out slaveholders' “investments,” amounted to a radical act by a supremely savvy, morally driven president, he said.The document itself, issued in September 1862 as a warning to Southern states that slaves would be freed the following January if the Confederacy did not end the rebellion, went into effect at midnight, Jan.1, 1863. But it applied only to slaves living in Confederate breakaway states back under Union Army control. It also included exemptions. It freed between 50,000 and 70,000 slaves immediately, Foner said. About 750,000 African Americans living in slave-dense places like New Orleans were not subject to Lincoln’s executive order and remained chattel. For just over 3 million others, slavery itself would not end until Union forces advanced across the Confederacy. As they did, Union Army soldiers read from pocket-sized copies of the Emancipation Proclamation, announcing the president’s order to slaves, Bunch said. In states like Texas, that moment came in June 1865, two and half years after Lincoln slipped away from that White House party. Slavery itself became an unconstitutional and utterly illegal institution that same year, when Congress approved the 13th Amendment. “What Americans have to understand is that there were 100 years between Lincoln signing the Emancipation Proclamation and the 1963 March on Washington,” said Bunch, “and a few years more before that freedom was given any durable and consistent meaning with the Voting Rights Act and the Civil Rights Act.""""When you understand that freedom was a process, not a moment, then you can allow yourself to wonder what work is left for us in the next 100 years.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misidentified the location of the Virginia fort where four slaves took refuge after the start of the Civil War."

The first shots of the Civil War also were fired in Charleston in 1861.""It's not just an African-American celebration, it's an American celebration, akin to the Fourth of July,"" Reverend Clementa Pinckney said to 100 congregants at the two-hour service, known as Watch Night. ""It's freedom come full circle.""As he read aloud excerpts from the proclamation, he told the congregation, ""We stand on the shoulders of abolitionists and missionaries.""The lights inside the 194-year-old church were turned off shortly before midnight. In the dark, a succession of singers in a minute-by-minute countdown to the new year called, ""Watchman, watchman, please tell me the hour of the night.""The minister's response pierced the darkness. ""It is three minutes to midnight,"" then ""It is two minutes to the new year,"" then ""Last chance to pray in 2012."" Finally, ""It is now the new year. Freedom has come.""Watch Night, a historical New Year's Eve tradition of reflection and prayer in some American Protestant churches, became a tradition in African-American churches starting in 1862.That night, on ""Freedom's Eve,"" black churches and abolitionist communities waited for what 19th-century abolitionist leader Frederick Douglass wrote was ""the glorious morning of liberty about to dawn upon us.""The proclamation, which Lincoln issued on Jan. 1, 1863, in the middle of the Civil War, formally declared free millions of slaves in rebellious states that had left the United States and were not occupied by federal troops. It also allowed black men who had been enslaved to join the Union Army and Navy.Though slavery was not fully abolished until the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1865, Watch Night was ""a celebration of what freedom might mean,"" said Dawn Chitty, education director of the African American Civil War Museum in Washington, D.C., which focuses on the history and contributions of the United States Colored Troops.""It wasn't just about being free to walk away from chains and shackles and forced labor, but about having a chance to fight for a country that didn't uphold any rights that you had at the time,"" she said.Historians and scholars agree that slaves in the South were aware of the coming proclamation, which had been published months before it was signed.""Groups of people gathered together with song, prayer, programs, whatever they could do, to recognize what was coming at midnight,"" Chitty said.A few years later in 1868, Charleston blacks began holding an annual Emancipation Day parade, a tradition that they planned to repeat on Tuesday with floats, marching bands and community organizations taking part.The parade was among a number of events being held across the country to mark the 150th anniversary of the Emancipation Proclamation. A three-day display of the fragile original document was due to end on Tuesday at the National Archives in Washington. (Editing by Colleen Jenkins, Barbara Goldberg and Bill Trott)"

With these letters, we hope to look back on the progress our community has made and give thanks to those who helped pave the way. You can see them all here. (The name, Tinko, is the actual name of my ancestor who was sold in Virginia for roughly $300 and his children were eventually sold to a plantation in Stovall, Georgia.)Dear Tinko,I write this letter with a sense of joy and a degree of cynicism within my spirit. You are the only ancestor of my family who is documented as being bought for three hundred dollars in the state of Virginia. Your progeny was eventually sold to a plantation in Stovall, Georgia and forced to live a life of servitude until emancipation. To live a life in a foreign land, stripped of all humanity and forced to live with untold brutality, can barely be conceived in the modern mind. I cannot imagine the experience of living as property forced to labor under a racial lie and the theological heresy of biological determinism. I want to share with you in this letter the progress of this nation since the time you walked upon southern soil. I was joyous when I began to write this letter, as the stories of the abolition and the rise of educational institutions built by our own hands came to the forefront of my consciousness. Glorious towns were erected just outside of Tulsa, Oklahoma and in Eatonville, Florida, where wealth, ownership, and progressive life became the norm. But, as I walked through our history, my heart became troubled, as images of broken dreams, promises, and unmarked graves stood silently next to the images of triumph. After the signing of the ""Emancipation Proclamation,"" our hearts soared with possibility, but reality crushed our dreams as quickly as a summer squall upon the sea. We walked from the south, free from the shackles of the peculiar institution, the most skilled people in our nation: carpenters, horticulturalists, managers, blacksmiths, seamstresses, and teachers. The list goes on; yet, our skills became a threat to the white unskilled labor of the south. Vengeance, not reconciliation, became the political platform of the day, as we sought to etch out a life post-emancipation. We organized, to educate ourselves, build schools, raise our children, and establish our humanity in the face of inhumanity, but at every turn, we met resistance, and, at times, an insane political culture shaped by a poisoned racial imagination. This is not the totality of our history. Much has been achieved in these post-emancipation years, however, what has been achieved has been hard won by named and unnamed men and women of courage.I wish you could visit Harlem and hear the songs and sounds of artists who took the genius of your contemporaries and created poetic works and literary songs of a new ""Negro"" renaissance. I wish you could walk the campuses of Tuskegee, Morehouse, Spelman, Howard, and Hampton, and witness ideas blossoming in the mind of the grandchildren of slaves yearning to be men and women. I wish you could witness Marcus Garvey speaking to us as God's children and not ""the wretched of the earth,"" or read the essays of W.E. B. DuBois, as he reflects on life post-reconstruction, or sit in on an organizing meeting with A. Phillip Randolph as ""Pullman Porters"" claimed their dignity through organized labor. Atlanta, Georgia the citadel of the genteel south produced a prophet named Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., who forced the Constitution to repent and America to reflect upon her creed.I know I am leaving out much more; yet, the triumphs are too vast and tragedies are too numerous to count. I must also share an unbelievable moment in our history. Our current President and First Family are people of African descent! As unlikely as it may sound, democracy and history collided and produced a moment you and our ancestors only dreamed was possible.There are those who claim we live in a post-racial society and others who claim we still live in a racist society. I say we live in a race-consciousness society, fearful of class and apprehensive about color. We are not post-racial, nor are we solely defined by the social construction of race. We are post-emancipation, but, we are still a pre-promised land nation still looking at the future from the mountain top and not the plain of realized dreams. Gains have been made in this nation, but the beloved community still waits in the harbor of our prophetic imagination. Maybe one day we will reach it but as of now we still dream. I thank you for your courage this day, and look forward to meeting you one day in our Father's house, when time and space cease to be weights upon our temporal existence.Sincerely,The Rev. Dr. Otis Moss III (Descendant of enslaved African named ""Tinko"")"

With these letters, we hope to look back on the progress our community has made and give thanks to those who helped pave the way. You can see them all here. As the Emancipation Proclamation technically didn't free all slaves, when looking at it in the context of today I would say there are those of color who are living a full life with all the advantages, while we have others who are still mentally shackled down with missed opportunities, some created by purposeful societal barriers and sometimes of our own constructed barriers. We can even flash forward to another famous speech when it was declared that 'all men are created equal' and ask ourselves: Does this include the voices of those who identify as black and gay?As a gay black man I try to see where I fit into the Emancipation Proclamation as I'm sure when it was drafted it didn't involve me. In looking for how I fit in I place myself standing next to my brothers knowing that some of my brothers don't want to stand next to me. The perception of being free is not lost on me but what is lost is the acceptance of straight black men and the missing dialogue between us. In that regard we are not free as the machismo attitudes of black men obstruct the union that would fully unite our community. This missing dialogue only obstructs the strength we would have in the name of unity.Yet looking in the light of the concept of free and knowing that the freedom of expression I have available to me I can build on those who are open to hear my story and those who do not pass judgment or quote scriptures to me. In this regard I, like others, have lived a life of free expression not bound down by the condemnation of the few that wants us to remain on non-existent plantations. As people of color who identify as gay we have made many contributions, some that have never left the lips of those making contributions and some that can be seen in the reflection of today's media. Although we have been erased from history books we still continue to make history. Bayard Rustin, a gay black man who organized the Martin Luther King walk on Washington knows of what I speak.For those who are coming to a place of accepting or discovering their sexual identity, know that more are placing themselves on the front line of being free not only to express ourselves but to simply be ourselves. A change truly is coming into being as even straight brothers and sisters are adjusting their eyes to our realities and moving us from the blind spot of their consciousness.In this post-era of Emancipation we have to include the voices and spirit of all and not pick and choose who should be a member of the club. As the line in the song states, ""None of us is free, if one of us is chained."" So to those who understand and buy into this concept of freedom, know that you're not alone and understand that your identity and ideals shouldn't exclude you but do know that your openness and the ability to grasp the fellowship of those who are gay truly makes one free."

With these letters, we hope to look back on the progress our community has made and give thanks to those who helped pave the way. You can see them all here. Dear Survivors of the Emancipation: I write full of hope that change has finally come.The first African-American president, Barack Obama, has just been reelected to his second term in office. Despite four years of unrelenting obstruction and recalcitrant by the modern-day Republican Party, a strong coalition of African-American voters were joined by Asian Americans, Hispanics, progressive whites and independents to choose action over apathy. The America we inherited from you is a rainbow of opportunity, choice and cooperation. Gone are the days when women were second-class citizens. Dead are the days when Blacks had no voice. Race is no longer a defining limitation in how we choose to love, marry or serve our country. We are the future we've been waiting.But as you may have wisely anticipated, the struggle for equality continues.After 150 years since the Emancipation Proclamation was codified into law, there are more African-American males in prison, or under the authority of the criminal justice system, than were enslaved in 1850.According to the U.S. Department of Justice, 846,000 black males were incarcerated in 2008 -- making up 40.2 percent of the total prison population. African-Americans accounted for a mere 13.6 percent of the U.S. population in the same year. Professor Michelle Alexander highlighted this racially disparate phenomenon in her book The New Jim Crow: Colorblindness in the Age of Mass Incarceration, in which she points out that more African-American men were disenfranchised of their right to vote in 2004 -- due to felony convictions -- than were denied that right in 1870, ""the year the Fifteenth Amendment was ratified prohibiting laws that explicitly deny the right to vote on the basis of race"".The American Dream remains elusive to far too many. Young Black and Latino males are stopped, harassed and frisked by police officers in major cities as if it were as a right of passage. African-American teenagers are eight times more likely to die from gun violence than white teenagers. And despite conservatives seeking to disregard urban crimes as gang-related, or outside the mainstream, white males commit the vast majority of violent crime and gun crimes in particular -- but African-American males are more likely to be the victims of such crimes or be arrested.The names of Trayvon Martin, Jordan Davis, Kendrec McDade, Sean Bell and Amadou Diallo are just a few whose ghosts remind us that even the innocent and unarmed become targets for their brown skin alone. Skittles and iced tea, wallets and loud music are used as justifications for murder of our sons, brothers, cousins and friends. African-American youth are gunned down, inexplicably, in the manicured gardens of Sanford, Fla., or on the concrete street corners of New York. The Children's Defense Fund found that African-American children represent 15 percent of the U.S. children's population, but 45 percent of all gun deaths in their age group in 2008/2009. And Black children are less likely to be raised in a home by both parents, than a child born into slavery in the 1860s, and, partly as a result, more likely to grow up in poverty.These statistical truths are often told and retold for divergent political ends. I repeat them here not that you may remember the worst, but that you might forget it. For in your time, African-Americans were counted three-fifths of a person. Today we govern the Oval Office. Our community alone concentrates more wealth than some of the world's richest countries. If Black Americans were a nation, they'd be the 16th wealthiest in the world. A recent study found that 44 percent of African American men and 53 percent of women were college-educated or earning a degree. Though 20 percent of us may struggle below the poverty line, 80 percent are thriving, educating ourselves and conquering the world in ways unimaginable to you.In the words of Maya Angelou, we are the hope and dream of the slave. We do not bear this legacy lightly, nor do we easily forget how far we've come.  We remain full of the faith that the dark past has taught us, and full of the hope that the present has brought us.Edward Wyckoff Williams is contributing editor at The Root.
