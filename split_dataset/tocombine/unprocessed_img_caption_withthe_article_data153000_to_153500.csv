So it doesn't predict which embryos [will] create a baby, but it does help us choose which embryos to transfer.In Carter's case, Marsden said, the system identified which single embryo out of five possible embryos had ""the best chance of development."" She also noted that the hospital would be ""fully time-lapse"" as of the following week.""To watch our hard work in research and innovation result in a real life healthy baby is the main reason we do what we do and it is why we work so hard to make people’s dreams of a family become a reality,"" Dr. Leanne Bricker, who delivered the baby, told the Liverpool Echo.The Echo also reports that another Eeva baby will likely be born in Scotland this week; that baby was actually originally expected to be the first ever Eeva baby (Ruth Carter's baby was almost a month early).According to a press release from Auxogyn, the company that produces Eeva, the test was available at six European clinics as of May 7. Liverpool Women's Hospital's Hewitt Fertility Center was the first of those clinics, according to a hospital press release published at the end of February. At the time, the center's lead consultant, Professor Charles Kingsland, called Eeva ""the biggest breakthrough in IVF in the last 10 years"" and said it allowed doctors to predict an embryo's chance of success with 85 percent accuracy.The test's website further explains:Eeva consists of a special microscope that fits inside a standard incubator and takes video images of your embryos, which are analysed by proprietary, intelligent software. Your embryos are cultured within a specially-designed Eeva dish while Eeva watches over your embryos through Day 3 or Day 5, depending upon the advice of your IVF team.Eeva has not yet been approved by the FDA.As The Telegraph points out, the Eeva technique is similar but not identical to another new embryo selection method, based on thousands of time-lapse photos and ""morphokinetic algorithms to predict success"" or MAPS, that made headlines in May. The researchers who developed MAPS suggested when their findings were published that they could triple national live birth rates in Britain using the technique, which, like Eeva, allows for much closer monitoring of embryos than traditional microscope-based examinations."

The heavy metal legend and his business partner Mario Fulgoni plan to start with three private jets, Dickinson explained. They already bought a flight simulator to slash pilot-training costs, the Telegraph reports.“Subject to approvals, we’ll be in the air within the next 50 days,” Dickinson told the paper. “Clearly that fits with the maintenance -- both operations need each other.” Dickinson has juggled rock 'n' roll and flying for decades -- he even flew the band around. For more on Dickinson's latest venture, visit the Telegraph.MSN had some fun, calling the aviation endeavor ""fitting for a man whose voice has often been favorably compared to an air-raid siren.""But Dickinson's airline aspirations are no pie-in-the-sky chatter. In 2011, after he lost his 757-piloting job with Astraeus Airlines when the carrier folded, he said was aiming to get his own airline off the ground.At age 54, he's not too old to rock, either. Iron Maiden, which Dickinson joined in 1982 and helped propel to more than 80 million album sales, recently departed on another world tour.Back in 2007, Dickinson told CNN he was inspired to fly by relatives who were in the Royal Air Force but didn't feel he had the right stuff. ""And then our drummer learned to fly, so I said if a drummer can learn to fly, then anyone can,"" he said."

HuffPost Celebrity reported that the 57-year-old singer's cancer was found early -- it was a stage one tumor -- and that it's ""operable and curable,"" but it caused the cancellations of a tour and postponed the release of a new album. Bile duct cancer is quite rare, with only 2,000 to 3,000 people developing the condition each year in the U.S., according to the National Cancer Society. It occurs when a tumor grows on the bile duct (can be inside or outsider the liver); the bile duct is responsible for taking bile from the gallbladder to the small intestine. Age, liver disease, chemical exposure and bile duct inflammation are all considered risk factors for bile duct cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health.The Mayo Clinic reported that bile duct cancer is most common among people ages 50 and older, and symptoms often include jaundice of the skin and eyes, having white-colored stools and excessive itchiness on the body. There are three main kinds of bile duct cancer: intrahepatic bile duct cancers, which account for about one in 10 bile duct cancer cases; perihilar bile duct cancers, which are also called Klatskin tumors and are the most common kind of bile duct cancer; and distal bile duct cancers, which occur closer to the part of the bile duct near to the small intestine and are outside the liver, according to the American Cancer Society. The University of Southern California reported that treatments differ depending on the type of bile duct cancer; for instance, tumors that occur nearer to the top part of the bile duct are often treated with surgical removal of the tumor and even removal of the liver, while tumors that occur on the bottom part of the bile duct usually are treated with a Whipple operation (where part of the bile duct, duodenum and gallbladder are removed). The National Institute of Health also noted that chemotherapy and radiation therapy are also treatment options for bile duct cancer. It is unknown what type of treatment Jones plans to receive. "
