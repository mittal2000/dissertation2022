She's usually depressed, distraught and emotional -- right?Wrong, according to new research out of London's Kingston University. Over the course of two decades, researchers regularly questioned 10,000 U.K. citizens between the ages of 16 and 60 about their happiness levels before and after major life milestones. Their research, published in the journal Economica, concluded that women are significantly more content than usual for up to five years after divorce. Men also reported feeling slightly happier following the divorce decree, but the increase was less signifiant.""In the study we took into account the fact that divorce can sometimes have a negative financial impact on women, but despite that it still makes them much happier than men,"" said Professor Yannis Georgellis, Director of the Centre for Research in Employment, Skills and Society at Kingston Business School. ""One possible explanation could be that women who enter into an unhappy marriage feel much more liberated after divorce than their male counterparts.""The latest findings are contrary to controversial conclusions made by the Institute for American Values over a decade ago. In a 2002 study, the institute -- which defines itself in the text as a private, non-partisan organization devoted to contributing intellectually to the renewal of marriage and family life and the sources of competence, character, and citizenship -- found that unhappily married adults who divorced were no happier after the split than unhappily married adults who stayed married.We want to know: Were you happier after divorce?

Researchers at the University College London found that people whose parents split before they reached age 16 had significantly higher levels of C-reactive protein -- a blood marker of inflammation that's associated with greater risk of heart disease and Type 2 diabetes.The study, published in the journal Psychoneuroendocrinology, included samples taken at age 44 from 7,462 people who participated in the longitudinal 1958 National Child Development Study. Dr. Rebecca Lacey, lead author of the study, explained that disadvantages that arise after divorce -- economic hardships and fewer educational opportunities, for example -- could be to blame for the health disparity rather than the event of the divorce, itself. ""Our study suggests that it is not parental divorce or separation per se which increases the risk of later inflammation but that it is other social disadvantages, such as how well the child does in education, which are triggered by having experienced parental divorce which are important,"" she said.This isn't the first time that a link has been found between divorce and children's health. In 2011, researchers found that children of divorce are more likely to contemplate suicide later in their lives than children whose parents remained together.Click through the slideshow below for even more interesting divorce-related research findings.Keep in touch!

2,PARENTING,Moms Who Drink Too Much,"Heather Kopp, Contributor
Author of Sober Mercies: How Love Caught Up with a Christian D...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/moms-who-drink-too-much_us_5b9d5385e4b03a1dcc86ab8a,We're kidding ourselves if we think that our addiction to any mood-altering drug or activity isn't affecting our kids. And we're dangerously deluded if we conclude that it can actually improve our parenting.,2013-07-11,2013-07-11-_USAGE_UPLOAD-shutterstock_114386725small.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-07-11-_USAGE_UPLOAD-shutterstock_114386725small.jpg,"A couple of weeks ago, I got an email from a mom I'll call ""Lucy,"" who told me that she recognized herself in my book. Which is to say, she's an admitted alcoholic who hides her problem well. Lucy is married to a prominent doctor, is the mother of two school-aged kids, and is involved in her church. She admits that by all counts, she has a beautiful life. ""So why can't I stop drinking?!"" she wrote. ""How on earth did this happen?"" My guess is what happened to Lucy is what's happening to a growing number of moms. As noted in a recent  article, studies show it's become trendy for moms to combine happy hour with play dates, or to reach for an afternoon cocktail to take the edge off a hard day with the kids. For many moms, this works just fine. But for women predisposed to alcoholism, pretty soon, happy hour turns into a daily habit -- and every day becomes a hard day. Once we realize we're stuck, denial kicks in. ""I know for sure that I'm a great mom,"" Lucy wrote. ""My secret drinking hasn't ever harmed my kids. I never slur or stumble. Sometimes, I think it makes me a more loving, patient mom."" I don't doubt that Lucy can drink copious amounts of alcohol with nary a misplaced foot or word. Increased tolerance is a hallmark of alcoholism. Neither do I doubt that drinking makes Lucy less irritable with her kids. Nothing soothes an alcoholic's agitation more quickly than a drink. But here's the rub. And I say this with love: We're kidding ourselves if we think that our addiction to any mood-altering drug or activity isn't affecting our kids. And we're dangerously deluded if we conclude that it can actually improve our parenting. By the way, this was me to a T. My own kids were in junior high and high school when I spiraled into alcoholism. I clung like a cat on a curtain to this idea that what my kids didn't know couldn't hurt them, but if I didn't get to drink, I just might. What I failed to reckon was that kids sense it in their bones when you are not fully present. They know you're numbing your feelings and some part of you has gone missing, even if they can't put it into words until later. My kids were grown before they could name the myriad ways alcohol robbed them of Mom. Of course, many addicted moms aren't so subtle in the havoc they wreak. I know plenty who have lost custody of their kids because of drugs or alcohol. Ironically, though, it's those of us with the wherewithal to work hard to try to manage our drinking who often stay stuck the longest. We high-functioning, fine-winos take first place in rationalization and image management, but we're the last to reach for help. I suffered for twelve long years before I finally admitted my life was unmanageable and got into recovery. Since then, I've struggled to name and grieve the losses -- conversations I never had with my kids, intimate moments we never shared --because I don't even know what I missed. I like to think I would have done better if I had known better. And what about all those moms who aren't alcoholics? Should they be worried about how their drinking impacts their kids? One mother wrote to ask, ""If I'm not an alcoholic, getting visibly drunk, or neglecting my kids, is there really any harm in drinking quite a bit?"" I don't have a good answer. Partly because ""harm"" is hard to measure, and do no harm is a pretty poor standard for parenting. But I think we can all agree that a mom doesn't have to be alcoholic to drink to excess, set a bad example or become emotionally unavailable.We can also agree that moms have the hardest job on the planet. I'm the last to begrudge them a cocktail or two when they want them. I know plenty of great, loving parents who drink on a regular basis, and do so responsibly.If you're one of those moms, I raise my glass of sparkling water to toast you! But if you're not so sure, it's never too late reach for help. More important, it's never too soon."
