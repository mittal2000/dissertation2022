(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2fcb62400005000973869.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Joseph AxNEW YORK, Aug 31 (Reuters) - Occupy Wall Street protesters who once vowed to ""occupy"" the courts by challenging their arrests on minor violations have since been defeated by the slow pace of justice, with many forgoing trial.As Occupy's two-year anniversary approaches on Sept. 17, the movement that once captivated national attention has largely faded.Hundreds of protesters campaigning against economic inequality set up a makeshift encampment in a downtown Manhattan park, inspiring dozens of similar sites across the country. Police eventually cleared the New York City park in a late-night raid.More than 2,600 arrests were made in Manhattan in connection with Occupy, including 700 on the Brooklyn Bridge on Oct. 1.Approximately half of all defendants pleaded guilty in exchange for a dismissal of charges after six months of staying out of trouble with the law. Hundreds more accepted other plea deals. Overall, fewer than 70 cases reached trial, less than 3 percent of the total; 53 resulted in convictions.Sixteen cases remained as of August, according to statistics tracked by the Manhattan District Attorney's office.Many defendants found it too onerous to return time and again for court dates at the overburdened New York City Criminal Court, which handles hundreds of thousands cases a year, even when they felt their arrests were illegitimate, said Martin Stolar, a National Lawyers Guild attorney who handled hundreds of cases.""What is the best use of your time?"" Stolar said he asked several clients. ""Is it coming to court and fighting the case, or is it moving on and continuing to do the political work that led you to the Occupy movement in the first place?""For nearly two years after her arrest on the Brooklyn Bridge during an Occupy Wall Street march, Karina Garcia refused to accept a plea deal.At her ninth court appearance in June, tears came to her eyes after the judge told her to come back again in two months. Finally, the judge ruled earlier this month that prosecutors had taken too long to bring her to trial and threw out her case.""I was like, is this really happening? Is it finally over?"" said Garcia, a schoolteacher at the time of her arrest. ""It's been a very punitive process.""The vast majority of arrested protesters were charged with minor infractions, such as disorderly conduct or blocking vehicular traffic.At the time, many protesters said they would fight the charges and press for trials. Court officials designated a special courtroom, and the Manhattan District Attorney's office assigned a team of prosecutors.Some of the few cases that still endure have lasted more than 10 times as long as the encampment did.""It's been a much slower process than I ever imagined,"" said Justin Adkins, 35, who traveled several hours from Williamstown, Massachusetts, to 10 court appearances before his case was also tossed out for speedy trial violations. FLOOD OF CASESAs Garcia, Adkins and hundreds of other protesters were getting arrested on the Brooklyn Bridge, Assistant District Attorney Nitin Savur's Blackberry began buzzing.A week earlier, police had arrested nearly 100 people during an Occupy demonstration in Union Square, and prosecutors knew they could soon have a flood of cases.""We started realizing, this is not going to be one or two arrests each day,"" said Savur, the deputy chief for the office's trial division.Savur and other senior prosecutors decided to appoint an experienced assistant, Michele Bayer, as ""protest supervisor"" and assigned two assistants to handle all Occupy-related cases.The model proved successful, Savur said, enough that the office has designated a protest supervisor for other large-scale events, such as city parades, that could result in mass arrests. Overall, judges dismissed only a handful of cases for speedy trial reasons.Still, the Occupy cases inched along, sometimes delayed for months at a time, a pace that defense lawyers said was common at Manhattan Criminal Court.The grind that confronts criminal defendants was a revelation for Occupy defendants, many of whom were white, first-time offenders.""People with very little experience with the criminal justice system see how it works, and they're astounded,"" said Stolar, the defense lawyer.The Occupy cases included many defendants who were initially reluctant to accept deals. In addition, cases that involve defendants in jail are given priority, pushing Occupy cases further back in line.Occupy cases typically involved lengthy pre-trial proceedings as defense lawyers argued their clients were simply exercising their right to free expression.""These are not your run-of-the-mill, drinking-a-beer-on-the-sidewalk cases,"" said Justin Barry, the chief clerk for New York City Criminal Court. ""These defendants had issues they wanted to bring up with the judge, and that takes time."" (Reporting by Joseph Ax; editing by Andrew Hay)"

The singer's third studio album, it was met with mixed reviews. Entertainment Weekly said the melodies sounded a ""tad familiar,"" while Rolling Stone criticized the lyrics for being ""made up entirely of pop and soul clichés."" The New York Times awarded ""Box"" a favorable review, saying it has ""an even sharper focus than Ms. Carey's previous two best-selling albums.""  ""Music Box"" debuted at No. 2 and remained among Billboard's Top 10 albums for 31 weeks.  It was the first time Carey worked with Babyface. The producer was brought on to make ""Music Box"" sound more like pop than Carey's previous albums had.

A cover of Harry Nilsson's song of the same name, ""Without You"" remains Carey's only single to hit No. 1 in the U.K.A third ballad, ""Anytime You Need a Friend,"" became the final single from ""Music Box."" It was the first of Carey's singles not to reach the Top 10, despite remaining in the Top 40 for 18 weeks.Kelly Price, who would go on to see success as an R&B solo artist, sang backup vocals on the album.  (Seen here in 2000)""Music Box"" remains Carey's highest-selling album, having sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. It's also one of the best-selling albums of all time.

In a message the actress posted on her website, Lohan said she never confirmed she was attending the festival and that she must place her current focus elsewhere. ""Of course, I would have enjoyed returning to that wonderful city and being a part of this amazing event, but my focus is on my health and well-being,"" Lohan writes. ""Plain and simple, it is of the utmost importance.""Speculations ran wild after director Paul Schrader seemed to make disparaging remarks about his work with the actress. When asked at a press conference why Lohan wasn't present for the premiere, Shrader said, ""For the last 16 months, I've been hostage, by own choosing, to a very talented but unpredictable actress. She was supposed to be here today. She said she would be, but she is not."" Lohan had already expressed her support for her ""Canyons"" colleagues from across international lines, but this time she felt it necessary to be more specific about the situation. A message posted Wednesday on her website read, ""I wish I could be there to celebrate with you in Venice. Paul Schrader, @braxtonpope, @JamesDeen could not have done it without you.""We're confident Lohan means it when she says her clean bill is of utmost importance at the moment, but we suspect another force is at play here: Oprah Winfrey. In her widely watched interview with Lohan, the talk-show queen strongly urged the actress not to go to Italy, though her initial plans were broader than attending the festival. Lohan said she would seriously consider Winfrey's suggestion. After all, no one ignores Oprah. "

Growing big cabbages is a tradition in this part of the state, just north of Anchorage, which is considered Alaska's main farm belt.This year was the first time in the contest's 18 years that a child has won the weigh-off, according to state fair officials. The fair offers a junior competition for growers 12 and younger, but Keevan's entry was put into the adult open category because of its size.Keevan, whose family operates a local farm, took home $2,000 for his prize-winner.Keevan's ""Bob"" fell short of the world-record 138.3-pound (62.7-kg) cabbage, called the ""Palmer Pachyderm,"" grown last year by Palmer greenhouse owner Scott Robb.While the unusually hot and sunny summer was good for many crops, that was not the case for the traditional green cabbages, said growers attending Friday's fair weigh-in.""Cabbages are a cold crop. They like their roots warm and their heads cool,"" said Mardie Robb, Scott Robb's wife.Alaska's giant vegetables also face hazards, including marauding moose that are fond of poaching would-be winners while they are growing in gardens, and flaws that might develop during growing can knock them out of contention.This year, a potential state-champion pumpkin, a 1,289-pound (584.6 kg) specimen named ""Time Bandit"" and grown by J.D. Megchelsen of Nikiski, was disqualified because of a hole, violating rules calling for vegetables to be structurally intact. Absent the hole, it would have just beaten the Alaska pumpkin record of 1,287 pounds (583.8 kg) that Megchelsen set in 2011.

The polarizing quarterback has been released by the New England Patriots, as first reported by Adam Schefter of ESPN. The cut came after a lackluster preseason for Tebow, who could not unseat Ryan Mallett as Tom Brady's backup. Shortly after Schefter first reported the Patriots' move, citing an unnamed league source, Ian Rapoport of NFL.com also reported the release of the Heisman Trophy-winning quarterback, also citing an unnamed source familiar with the move. As is the case with all things related to Tebow, his release garnered plenty of attention among both his supporters and critics. Tebow signed with the Patriots in June, inking a two-year deal without any guaranteed money. Although the team didn't waste time in selling his jersey to fans, the 26-year-old didn't impress during the preseason. He appeared in three of the Patriots' four preseason games, completing 11 of 30 passes for 145 yards, two touchdowns and two interceptions.“I’m blessed because of my faith, because you don’t have to worry about the future, because I know who holds my future,” Tebow told reporters after the Patriots' final preseason game with roster cuts looming, via CBS Boston. “A lot of times people use that as a cliche, but it’s something I try to live by. It really gives you a lot of peace in whatever circumstance you’re in.”His release by the Patriots is the latest plot twist in what had once been a storybook rise to NFL stardom. Since piloting the Denver Broncos to a stirring overtime playoff win in 2012, Tebow has endured a tumultuous season with the Jets and an unproductive preseason with the Patriots. He will be looking for his fourth team since arriving in the NFL out of the University of Florida in the 2010 NFL Draft. The Patriots began Saturday with 65 players on the roster, meaning that a dozen players will be waived during the day. It seems that Tebow will be among that group forced to look for a spot with another team before the season opens. With Tebow's time in New England appearing to be drawing to a close, Patriots owner Robert Kraft told the media earlier this week that he was ""rooting"" for the devout signal caller. “I’m rooting for him. I’m in his corner,” Kraft said on Tuesday, via The Boston Herald. “I have the privilege of letting Bill (Belichick) make that decision. He’s got a pretty good record doing that.”UPDATE 4:51 p.m. EST: Tim Tebow tweeted out a message to his fans and the New England Patriots regarding his release.
