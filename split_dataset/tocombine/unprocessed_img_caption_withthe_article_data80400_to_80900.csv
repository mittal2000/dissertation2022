But not a lot of people know that Bernie has a robust catolog of musical work. So I thought it was important to look at all of Bernie Sanders' albums and see where his spoken word album landed. Also, I'm sure you've been in one of those ""What's your favorite Bernie Sanders song?"" conversations at a party. Everybody is rattling off hits like ""We Shall Overcome"" and ""The Banks Are Made Of Marble,"" and you're thinking, ""Those are the only two I know!"" Don't worry! This should help you out."" We Shall Overcome "" (1987) The album that put him on the musical map. Just great top to bottom. It speaks to his ability, and we get a sense of exactly who he is and what he's about. Very rare for a freshman album.RATING: 4.5/5BEST TRACKS:"" We Shall Overcome"" ""The Banks Are Made Of Marble""""Bernie Sanders Live"" (1988)Bernie LIVE at the Forum. This release was a brilliant move by Bernie to simmer expectation after such a hot start. He decided to record a live album with everybody's favorite hits while sprinkling in a few new tracks.

Bernie spends every track on this album taking on race relations and shining a light on topics that nobody was talking about at the time. With tunes to make you get up and get down. I mean the hook in "" Institutional Racism Is Real And We've Done Little To Stop It""  makes you want to jump on your bed and scream, ""BERNIE BABY!""RATING: 4/5BEST TRACKS""Institutional Racism Is Real And We've Done Little To Stop It""""Minorities Shouldn't Have To Work Three Jobs To Make Rent""  ""The Banks Did WHAT?!"" (1997)A change from his usual beat. Bernie's first (and only) comedy album was met with confusion and disdain. Mainly because his audience knew him to be a soulful musician, NOT an angry Lewis Black-style comic.

""But [America] is a different culture when it comes to guns than where I come from. … The idea of guns somehow in America is a completely different construct. It’s not one that I can completely get my head around. And I never will be able to.""Ejiofor credited the gun lobby for the inaction on gun control, noting the political sway of the organization and ""corrupt"" nature of the system. The actor said he was surprised to see the movement for control legislation reach a standstill after the ""horrific"" shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.""I certainly thought that after Sandy Hook, there was bound to be such a public outpouring ... that they would have to change, have to effectively change and for good,"" he said. ""I think it was devastating [and] shocking that the machinery of government wasn't able to effect proper change after that."" As for the recent controversy over police violence -- that's yet another aspect Ejiofor can't comprehend. ""The police don't kill people, that's not their job. It's not their job to kill people. It's their job to protect people, and that's it,"" he said.Watch the full HuffPost Live conversation with ""Z for Zachariah"" star Chiwetel Ejiofor here.Sign up here for Live Today, HuffPost Live’s morning email that will let you know the newsmakers, celebrities and politicians joining us that day and give you the best clips from the day before.Also on HuffPost:"

The ex-defenseman was arrested Wednesday for allegedly breaking into a man's home in Sylvan Beach, New York, on Aug. 11 and attacking him, according to officials. Purinton knew the victim, the spokesman told HuffPost. The victim was treated at a hospital in Utica and released.Purinton fled the scene before police arrived, according to a news release. When law enforcement tracked him down, the former player, who later took the menacing mugshot above, was ""very compliant with our investigator, very cooperative,"" the spokesman said to HuffPost.Good thing, cause this is how Purinton used to make his living:He compiled 578 penalty minutes in 181 games for the Rangers between 2000 and 2004.But if he's convicted of the crime, he won't be sent to the penalty box. The sentence for first-degree burglary can range from three to 25 years in prison, the spokesman said.Also on HuffPost:"

In the second quarter, Griffin dove trying to recover his own fumble and got hit by Lions defensive end Corey Wootton. Griffin also injured his shoulder.Griffin lay on the ground for several minutes before exiting the game. He completed just two of five passes for eight yards and got sacked three times for a total loss of 17 yards as his protection faltered.Washington Coach Jay Gruden was criticized for keeping the key player on the field for a fourth offensive series in a meaningless game.""Leaving Griffin in that game was borderline criminal,"" For The Win wrote. ""He needs the reps, sure, but at what cost?""""We felt confident in our tackle and our offensive line to try and get something going there with the fourth drive,"" Gruden told ESPN. ""Unfortunately, it didn't happen.""This is some of the punishment Griffin absorbed before the concussion:Griffin's head injury comes on the heels of an in-depth ESPN The Magazine interview with ex-49ers linebacker Chris Borland, in which he called football ""kind of dehumanizing."" Borland retired after one stellar season for fear of long-term cognitive problems from concussions. Borland estimated he sustained 30 concussions in his career, telling ESPN, ""If there were no possibility of brain damage, I'd still be playing."" Griffin may have also sustained injury to his ego after being mocked on social media for calling himself the best quarterback in the NFL earlier this week. Major injuries and spotty performances have stunted his progress as Washington seeks to rebound from winning just seven games over two seasons.H/T Sports IllustratedAlso on HuffPost:"
4,SCIENCE,Scientists Confirm That Some Spiders Can Pretty Much BASE Jump,Eliza Sankar-Gorton,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/spiders-base-jump_us_55d60284e4b07addcb45d6bc,"Why, Mother Nature?

(Scale bar is 1 cm.)</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55d603551d00002f001455f6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Your worst nightmare has come true: Spiders are falling from the sky. Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, the University of Louisville and the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute have found that some spiders in the tropical/subtropical genus Selenops leap from treetops and steer through the air to land on neighboring tree trunks -- much like a BASE jumper steering his or her way down a cliff.Selenops is the first genus of spider found to display this behavior, which is evidently does in order to find food and avoid predators. Some insects, like canopy ants, have also been observed doing this.For their research, the scientists collected 59 Selenops spiders from tree trunks in Peru and Panama. Then the researchers dropped the spiders one by one -- always from a height of between 65 and 80 feet, and always within about five feet of a nearby tree trunk -- and observed what happened.An overwhelming majority of these spiders -- 55 out of 59, or about 93 percent -- made what the researchers call a ""direct"" descent toward the tree trunk, meaning they glided toward the trunk in what appeared to be a controlled, deliberate manner and landed successfully on it.What's interesting, according to the findings, is that these spiders ""never attached draglines to the specimen vial during the initial drop, nor was silk ever seen during descent."" In other words, the spiders were in free fall -- but could still control the direction of their descent, apparently by moving and twitching their legs in midair. (The researchers note that ""each spider was tested only once, as it was not possible to recover individuals post-descent"" -- which, yeah, if someone dropped us from 65 feet off the ground, we wouldn't stick around to let them do it a second time, either.)If it's any comfort, the researchers note that ""other arachnid lineages,"" like scorpions and daddy longlegs, do not exhibit the same controlled gliding behavior, meaning you don't have to worry about scorpions paratrooping through your window at night.The findings were published Wednesday at the Journal of the Royal Society Interface website."

As discussed on ""So That Happened,"" the HuffPost Politics podcast, Trump faces a significant obstacle: math.The Trump Coalition is a plurality, not a majority, and as HuffPost's senior polling editor Mark Blumenthal has observed, The Donald will need more than a mere 25 percent to secure the GOP nomination. Recent history is littered with candidates who had Trump levels of support at this point in their primary elections and then lost the nomination. Trump could grow his support, but it seems unlikely considering the same polls that put him atop a heap of candidates also find majorities of voters would prefer ""someone else.""Look at this pretty picture:Trump's got 25 percent. Six other guys together have more than 40 percent. The non-Trump coalition hasn't settled on someone, but it probably will.

6,BLACK VOICES,"Is NYPD Crossing The Line, Again, In Its Black Lives Matter Surveillance?",Christopher Mathias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nypd-black-lives-matter-surveillance_us_55d609a1e4b055a6dab3407a,"That would be ""the same troubling surveillance it has conducted for decades on political activists.""",2015-08-21,"<p>Black Lives Matter protesters gather inside Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan on Dec. 7, 2014.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55d74a741400002e002e39a3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- The New York City Police Department's involvement in the surveillance of Black Lives Matter activists, as revealed this week by The Intercept, is once again raising questions about whether the NYPD is unlawfully monitoring political activity. Nearly 280 documents on how authorities watched protests, primarily inside Grand Central Terminal between November 2014 and January 2015, were turned over by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and Metro-North in response to a Freedom of Information Law request from the activists. According to The Intercept, the documents show that MTA counterterrorism agents, along with ""undercover"" officers, monitored 21 peaceful Black Lives Matter demonstrations at the Manhattan transportation hub, photographing and keeping files on individual activists who were doing nothing more than utilizing their First Amendment right to free speech and assembly.What's more, the documents reveal that the two agencies worked in conjunction with NYPD intelligence officers to monitor the protesters. ""The report about NYPD and MTA police officers conducting surveillance on protesters opposed to police brutality demonstrates that the NYPD remains engaged in the same troubling surveillance it has conducted for decades on political activists,"" Monifa Bandele, of the group Communities United for Police Reform, said in a statement Thursday. In 1971, civil rights lawyer Barbara Handschu, members of the Black Panthers and anti-war activists, among others, filed a lawsuit alleging that the NYPD had illegally infiltrated, surveilled and disrupted First Amendment-protected activity, mostly surrounding Vietnam War protests.As a result of the lawsuit, the NYPD agreed in 1985 to what's now called the Handschu agreement: Police can spy on constitutionally protected activity only when there is credible information of criminal activity and only after its surveillance plan is approved by an overseer called the Handschu authority. (This agreement does not apply to the MTA or Metro-North.)While the documents obtained by The Intercept this week show only glimpses of NYPD involvement in the surveillance of Black Lives Matter protesters, they suggest the department could be breaching the Handschu agreement.In a Feb. 13 email, for example, regarding one Grand Central demonstration, Anthony D'Angelis -- identified as an MTA liaison with the NYPD's counterterrorism division -- shares a photo of an individual protester.""Alex Seel (videographer/photographer) protester GTC,"" reads the subject line of the email, which D'Angelis sent from an NYPD email address. Activists told The Intercept they were surprised that Seel, who never revealed his name to police, was identified in the documents.Another email, from Jan. 12, shows D'Angelis sharing photos taken by an unnamed activist who posted photos of police patrolling inside Grand Central. The photos appear to be taken from the Twitter account of Black Lives Matter activist Keegan Stephan. And then there's an email from Jan. 1, which summarized another protest that day at Grand Central. It says that MTA officers from the Inter-agency Counterterrorism Task Force ""provided photographs and field reports in conjunction with NYPD Intel team members."" ""This is certainly something that makes us want to do some further inquiries,"" Martin Stolar, one of the attorneys that has worked on the Handschu lawsuit since its inception over 40 years ago, told The Huffington Post. ""One of the things that's of concern is the collection of photo or video evidence of people not involved in criminal conduct,"" he said, pointing to the actions of the MTA and MetroNorth. ""I don't know whether that's occurred [with the NYPD]."" If the police department has been collecting evidence about the protests, that could be a violation of the Handschu agreement. Stolar noted that in 2003, in response to the terror attacks of 9/11, a judge gave the city more latitude under the Handschu agreement. A rule requiring the NYPD to have ""specific information"" regarding a future crime in order to begin surveilling or infiltrating a group was loosened. Instead, cops only needed to show facts that could ""reasonably indicate"" a future crime to start an investigation.Stolar added that it was ""bothersome"" that documents about the Grand Central protests show the involvement of couterterrorism officers ""because if you are the police department treating peaceful First Amendment activity as terrorism, then we have a serious issue."" Stolar also speculated that the department could be using events at previous Black Lives Matter demonstrations to justify spying on others. For example, during one of demonstrations after the death of Eric Garner, the unarmed black man who was put in a police chokehold last summer, two cops were assaulted on the Brooklyn Bridge. ""And that gives them the ability to surveil every demonstration involving Garner,"" Stolar. ""That's the excuse they could use."" Stolar cautioned, however, that without more evidence, it's impossible to tell whether the NYPD has violated the Handschu agreement, and until then, neither he nor his co-counsel can take legal action.According to The Intercept, activists also filed a Freedom of Information Law request with the NYPD over the Grand Central protests, but the department has yet to fulfill the request. (If it ever does.) ""The NYPD confers with our Legal Bureau when planning for the policing of protests and demonstrations,"" Deputy Commissioner Stephen Davis told HuffPost in a statement Thursday. ""We comply with the various established guidelines governing police activities involving these public events.""Davis also disputed The Intercept's characterization of officers as ""undercover"" and said they were merely in plainclothes. Use of such officers, he said, was appropriate due to instances of criminal activity at previous demonstrations. But Bandele, of Communities United for Police Reform, sees the NYPD's actions as part of a long practice of treating peaceful demonstrators like terrorists.""This dubious surveillance by the NYPD continues under [New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's] administration despite its claims regarding reform, as the Intercept story further substantiates a previous April New York Times report regarding the questioning of protesters,"" Bandele said. ""Given the fact that [New York Police] Commissioner [William] Bratton previously stated that a new NYPD unit would dually handle protests and terrorism threats, New Yorkers should be very concerned about whose First Amendment rights are considered for taxpayer-funded NYPD surveillance."" That New York Times report documented intense post-arrest interrogation of at least 11 protesters in custody on petty charges related to the demonstrations. As a result of the report, NYPD Deputy Commissioner Lawrence Byrne wrote that the department had directed that post-arrest questioning of protesters ""may not be conducted absent explicit advanced authorization by the Legal Bureau on a case by case basis."" Similarly, in 2003, a judge overseeing the Handschu agreement reprimanded the NYPD after it was revealed that detectives had been using a document called the Demonstration Debriefing Form when interrogating anti-Iraq War protesters, The New York Times reported. The form tracked where the protesters went to school, what organizations they belonged to and what demonstrations they had previously participated in. Detectives also reportedly asked protesters about their political beliefs, including their views on Israel and Palestine.And in 2013, Stolar and his co-counsel filed papers in court accusing the NYPD of violating the Handschu rules when it used undercover officers to routinely surveil Muslims in restaurants, bookstores and mosques, as exposed by a Pulitzer Prize-winning Associated Press investigation. A settlement in that case is expected soon. Meanwhile, as Black Lives Matter protests continue in New York City and across the country, protesters can expect that more than one government agency is watching them. Another recent report from The Intercept revealed that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security has been monitoring Black Lives Matter protesters since demonstrations erupted in Ferguson, Missouri, one year ago.

Uniqlo's parent company, which also owns Theory and J Brand, also hopes the move will help it hold on to full-timers, many of whom scale back hours to accommodate the demands of their personal lives.“Uniqlo is constantly pushing the envelope on exploring new ways to best serve its employees and their needs, this is just one of the new programs we are trying,” the spokeswoman said.For now, it’s just a test program -- and it comes with some downsides. Still, if the four-day workweek succeeds, it could be offered up to white-collar corporate employees at headquarters and to other countries, Quartz reports. Uniqlo has no plans yet to export the four-day week to the U.S., where the idea is often held up as kind of a holy grail among beleaguered office workers, as Bloomberg noted.The news raises a perennial question: How should mega-retailers, known for treating their customers well, regard their employees? With a few notable exceptions, hourly retailer workers are usually treated as cheap, replaceable cogs.But lately, there are signs of change. More companies are grabbing headlines for treating workers well -- or at least trying to. And they’re not doing it for altruistic reasons: As the economy heats up and unemployment falls, employers are finding they need to do more to hang on to their workers.It’s important to note that Uniqlo’s friendly new policy comes with caveats. First, the “four-day” week is misleading, since workers will simply compress their time into four 10-hour days instead of five eight-hour days. It may not be a good fit for those who need to attend to daily tasks outside of work. Second, Uniqlo employees who opt for the compressed week will have to work weekends and holidays -- the retailer’s busiest times.“They are not offering employees fewer work hours (as a four-day work week would suggest), just giving them compressed work weeks or ‘summer hours’ all year long at the price of guaranteed weekends and holidays,” Ken Matos, senior director of research at the Families and Work Institute, told HuffPost in an email. “Still, I salute them for offering a variety of work options that can be useful for different people.”Uniqlo is known for doing a lot to retain workers, including offering extensive training and relatively good hourly pay that averages about $10 an hour in the U.S., according to salary site Glassdoor.“If people are happy, the retention rate is high,” Uniqlo's USA chief executive told Bloomberg this spring. The company has also been criticized in the past for terrible working conditions in its Chinese factories.There’s a large and growing body of research that demonstrates that treating retail workers humanely is actually good for business. Costco and Trader Joe’s have made names for themselves by paying hourly workers decently and offering benefits and clear paths to promotions.The idea gained traction this year as the economy improved and the movement to raise the minimum wage gained steam. Probably the biggest sign that things were changing on a wide scale was Walmart’s announcement in February that it would raise worker pay and reduce the uncertainty workers face when it comes to scheduling. Target soon followed suit.Earlier this week, Walmart revealed that the plan is costing slightly more than expected -- about $60 million over the past three months. It seems like a lot, but it was just 1 percent of $6 billion in operating expenses.Walmart CEO Doug McMillon seems to consider the expense an investment that will pay off in the long run with better sales. ""We're pleased that the investments we've made are helping to improve our business,” he said in a press release this week. “Even if it's not as fast as we would like.”"

11,SCIENCE,Whales Are Mysteriously Dying In Alaska,Ed Mazza,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dead-whales-alaska_us_55d69949e4b020c386de3f19,"""We do not yet know the cause of these strandings.""",2015-08-21,"<p>Bears are seen feeding on the carcass of a fin whale which washed up in Larson Bay, Alaska, near Kodiak in June 2015.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55d69a4f1d00006e0014570e.jpeg?ops=crop_3_71_592_238%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Whales are turning up dead along the Alaska coast in alarming numbers, and scientists so far have no idea what's causing it.Since May, 30 whales have been found dead along the coast, causing the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration to declare and ""unusual mortality event"" on Thursday. So far, the toll includes 11 fin whales, 14 humpback whales, one gray whale, and four unidentified cetaceans, according to the agency. That compares to just five dead whales in all of last year. ""NOAA Fisheries scientists and partners are very concerned about the large number of whales stranding in the western Gulf of Alaska in recent months,"" Dr. Teri Rowles, NOAA Fisheries' marine mammal health and stranding response coordinator, said in a news release. Rowles added: ""While we do not yet know the cause of these strandings, our investigations will give us important information on the health of whales and the ecosystems where they live. Members of the public can greatly assist the investigation by immediately reporting any sightings of dead whales or distressed live animals they discover.So far, scientists have been able to reach just one of the 30 whale carcasses. ""Alaska has an awful lot of coastline and much of it is difficult to reach,"" NOAA adviser Dr. Bree Witteveen told CBC. ""We can't get to those carcasses more often than not.""The broadcaster said an additional six dead whales have turned up along the coast of British Columbia, and Canadian authorities are working closely with NOAA. One theory is that a toxic algae bloom, created by warmer-than-usual waters off the West Coast, could be playing a role. “That always concerns us because that means there’s probably a change in overall pathogen exposure, possibly harmful algal blooms and other factors,” Rowles said in news conference on Thursday, according to Alaska Dispatch News.So far, one sample tested negative for a type of toxin produced by algae, but the carcass was so decomposed that it may not be reliable, the Dispatch News reported.The agency also said in an online FAQ that it's ""highly unlikely"" that radiation from Fukushima is playing a role, but that further testing is under way. NOAA said it may take months or years before scientists know for sure what's causing the deaths. It's the first unusual mortality event for whales ever in Alaska, and just the third of any kind in the state. The agency had previously declared such events for pinnipeds in 2011 and sea otters in 2006.The agency has released a map showing where the carcasses have been spotted, with a number of them concentrated in the Kodiak area. NOAA asks that anyone who spots a dead whale or a living distressed whale call the Alaska Marine Mammal Stranding Hotline at 877-925-7773, or contact the U.S. Coast Guard on VHF Channel 16.The agency is also asking that the public not approach or touch the whale.Updates will be posted on a website set up for the unusual mortality event."
