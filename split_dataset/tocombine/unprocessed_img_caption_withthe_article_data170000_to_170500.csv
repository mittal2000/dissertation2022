We had no jobs lined up, had rented an apartment we had not seen and couldn't afford, had been dating for about five minutes and lost the only debit card we had that was attached to an account with money in it en route to the city.Five years ago on Labor Day weekend, our first child, Molly, was born in a hospital on Manhattan's Upper East Side.Three months ago on Labor Day weekend, we celebrated her birthday, three days before she started kindergarten. There is a list on our fridge of what days she has yoga this year. She is committed to after-school classes or lessons three times a week and she decides if leggings or tights are a good choice each morning. She became a real child without my noticing, without permission and without looking back.It is impossible to describe what it is like to watching my once-baby giggle with her friends, pretending to be ""mama"" to her dolls, ""mooning"" me to impress a playdate. It's more difficult because it does not all feel good -- my joy is mixed with regret, and fear, and guilt, and wonder, and sadness. It is impossible to fathom how time eludes us once children arrive. Each year, they become unrecognizable from the baby or child they were the year before. Each day is over before I've begun to take it in.The last Saturday of summer vacation, we took three of Molly's girlfriends with their moms to lunch at a local store that caters to doll-crazy, accessory-obsessed girls from around the world. It also caters to dolls. It is a tourist destination, this store. The atmosphere of noise and plastic dolls and escalators can be overwhelming and impersonal and not necessarily pleasant -- unless you are a doll-crazy, fashion-obsessed little girl -- or her doll.My best friend joined us briefly (before she was scared off by the whining and all the miniature pink party hats ) with her new baby girl. I recognized in her face those same thoughts I used to have when I was around parents with older kids and mine were babies -- that will never happen to me. Just as we think we will never become the parents who bring screaming toddlers out to dinner, or lose touch with girlfriends because we're too busy with carpool obligations, or declare yoga pants okay for ""cocktail"" attire. We think our babies will remain just so -- immobile, helpless, warm and slippery, smiling on cue, themselves so much like dolls we dress them and re-dress them in tiny versions of the outfits we would wear.I remember bringing Molly to a pediatrician appointment within her first few weeks. Something had appeared on her skin, a rash. Or maybe it was that her umbilical cord hadn't come off completely on schedule. Or she'd spit up too many times. I don't remember. But I remember rushing to get there before the office closed. And once the doctor had assured me that everything was normal, getting Molly's baby jeans back on to her squiggling legs, her purple tee shirt and cardigan buttoned. Slipping her applique loafers onto her feet. ""It's like dressing a doll, isn't it?"" The doctor asked. ""They're like dolls at that age.""And they are -- until they startle us with their insight and observations, their personalities that come from anywhere and nowhere and exactly where. Molly insisted recently that we let the Green Peace workers talk to us. ""They want money, and we already give to other organizations that save the animals,"" I explained, trying to move past them on 14th Street. ""But mommy, I want to save the animals!"" And so we stopped.The kids all got new, expensive dolls at the store, courtesy of my mother. None would sleep with the doll in his or her bed, so the dolls sat on the couch with my husband and me, watching television that night. They are surprisingly life-like, and to an almost disturbingly degree, resemble our three children in miniature. This is the appeal of those particular dolls, I realize -- the ability we have to customize their features to match our child's hair, skin color and eyes. Was it the kids or we who were drawn to these dolls in the first place? Didn't I delight in how much the doll ""twins"" look like our own Henry and Ellie once we matched every color exactly so?They are marketed with pure brilliance. Obviously children, little girls in various stages of developing their sense of themselves and their friendships, gravitate toward these trusted companions, with their stories and their histories, the party dresses and tennis clothes, the canopy beds and the writing desks, the possibilities for play lay endlessly before them.And we parents, too, are enchanted -- shelling out hundreds of dollars for the fantasy; the delight in our daughters and sons; the dolls that will eventually find places on shelves, in closets, lying on the beds of grown children away at college. And the dolls will be at that moment as they are today. Always, though, we are happy to participate in the most sought-after fantasy of parenting: To play any game that offers an illusion of time standing still.This post originally appeared on Mama One to Three"

You get offered another cookie and it's hard to say no. Or, at a family dinner, someone passes around the turkey for a fourth time and you decide that you don't want to have leftovers. Or at your holiday party, there's a buffet with ten of your favorite fried foods.End result? A delicious Christmas... and a January filled with regret. Not only that, but you might end up feeling like you need to spend more time at the gym, and need to double your helping of celery for the rest of the year. Are those less-than-appealing activities in 2013 worth the brief and delicious pleasure in 2012?It's exactly the same with your credit cards. Once Christmas season arrives, our cards come out of our wallets and purses and basically stay in our hand so we can buy buy buy when we see the perfect gift for someone. (Let's not forget the surprise gifts -- when your kid remembers that they need to bring a gift to school tomorrow for a gift exchange... oh, plus one for their teacher and one for each of their ten best friends).As nice as all of that generosity is, it comes at a price: A very fat credit card bill. One that is bloated and out of shape and much bigger in January than it usually is.It's not uncommon for people to spend money at Christmas... and then spend months paying that Christmas bill off -- sometimes almost doubling the expense after you factor in the high interest rates of credit cards over a couple of months! For example, a $1000 Christmas bill in January that doesn't get paid off and racks up 20 percent interest will cost more in February and even more by March! That's a lot of Christmas weight.So what can you do before Christmas to help you avoid packing on the pounds of debt this year? Here are some tips:• Set a budget for your gift giving. It's okay to be generous but make sure that you aren't over-extending yourself. • Spread the cost over several credit cards to keep them all active and (if possible) to keep them all under 20 percent of the credit limit. • Don't buy something just because it's on sale. If you can't afford it, the discount will be erased with the higher interest payments in the coming months. • If you do go over your budget, don't wait until your credit card bill arrives in the mail to do something about it. Take action right now to get that debt paid down.When it comes to holiday weight, a few poor choices over Christmas can lead to weeks or even months of unpleasant hardship, and it's exactly the same with the debt that you can incur over this holiday season.Email me your credit question questions@jeannekelly.net"

That's the word that comes to mind with the full-scale press that has descended upon the news that Prince William and his wife, Katherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, are expecting their first child and that she is in the hospital for treatment of hyperemesis gravidarum. Even now, 20 years after the birth of my last child, I am strangely exhilarated by the validation of a medical condition that I suffered with through the pregnancies of all three of my children. I suspect more people than I knew thought I was exaggerating, that morning sickness is routine and I was somehow complaining about an all-too-common condition.I was the first of my family to become pregnant, the first of most of my friends. About 2.5 years into marriage, worrying that perhaps after years of endometriosis, which I had been diagnosed with at age 18, I might never be able to have children, I had scheduled an appointment with a fertility specialist. Happiness was making that call to cancel, as I found myself pregnant. That glow dimmed as the sickness began. Within weeks, I found myself plummeted to depths of suffering I had never imagined. Who knew pregnancy caused this? No one I knew had it. This isn't morning sickness. It's morning, noon, and night sickness and every minute in between. Solace was found in sleep and sex. Other than that, every waking second is a battle against a rising tide of crippling nausea that vomiting does not relieve.Some 26 years after the birth of my first child, I still can't look at wild rice or plain chicken broth. It took me years to be able to eat matzo ball soup, as my mother-in-law, worried sick that I wasn't going to survive this pregnancy, came from dinner at Duke Zeiberts with a big container of soup. Hungry, as I was growing a child in there, I lapped it up. Not 10 minutes later, all of it came back up. Undigested. There is nothing worse than vomiting up undigested food. Whole pieces of it come pouring up in a flood of bile, splashing up in your face. I would shudder with revulsion and then be grateful when vomiting just fluid, not food. There wasn't a day I felt well. Those pregnancy mothers, basking in the glow of maternal blossoming, were alien to me. In fact, I felt like I was nurturing an alien, a feeling confirmed by a close family friend who, having experienced the same kind of pregnancy, likened it to a parasite. You're the host, they are the organism and as they grow, they're killing you. Remarkably, my babies all got the nourishment they needed, even at my expense. At 5 foot 6 inches, very small-boned and under 110 pounds when I married, my weight dropped precipitously. A doctor's daughter, I prided myself on staying afloat. I knew all about applesauce and bananas and fruit juices to keep the electrolytes up. I tried everything else. Saltines, bread sticks, ginger tea, broth. None of it worked. With my last child, a daughter after two boys, I lost my grip. Thankfully, one night after falling up the steps, I told my husband to watch out for me. Must have been a sixth sense, or God giving me a nudge, for I don't remember that next day. I only remember opening my eyes, in my own bed, and finding the deeply concerned eyes of dreamy Dr. Heintze looking down at me. Perilously sick, heading into shock, veins collapsing, I ended up on IVs, in my house, for weeks. To compound matters, one of the boys had strep, which I got as well. That necessitated additional infusions. Once a day, a nurse would come, unhook me, help me into a bath, then back into bed. That didn't stop the vomiting or nausea. Now I had to lift the whole contraption over the threshold of the bathroom and squeak my way to the toilet. By then, there was the suggestion of medication to quell nausea, but I wasn't chancing that. Images of thalidomide babies swam through my head. Four months in, deeply afraid, I called my doctor and said, ""I think I'm carrying twins."" I was deeply afraid that if that feeling were true, I would lose both babies, as I was so ill. Unhooked from the thread of IVs, my husband took me to the doctor's. A sonogram revealed two small embryos, only one with a beating heart. I don't know how, but I just knew.Even reading this now I think, ""How did I do this three times?""In fact, I did it five times. I lost two babies in pregnancies that ended, in both cases, at the beginning of the fourth month. In both cases, sonograms showed a perfect baby and we were told we could share our happy news with the world. We were past the point of worry. But what had worried me was that I wasn't sick like the other times. I was nauseated and fatigued, the kind of morning sickness that everyone complains about. But no complaints from me: I could leave my house. I could lead a normal life. Both times I went to my OB-GYN with a feeling that something wasn't right, an uneasiness that life was lost. The first time, I told my husband, called my doctor and went in. There was no sign of anything wrong, just a feeling. In the darkened room, my husband and the doctor laughed together over some shared story, neither worried, as all tests had been perfect. I was the one staring at the screen as the sonogram wand moved over my pregnant belly quietly, saying, ""I don't see a heartbeat."" The room stilled. The baby was lost.The second time I didn't tell my husband. Waking on the morning of Yom Kippur, the day in the Jewish religion where one is written in the Book of Life, I had a deeply uneasy, sad feeling that something was wrong. I am Catholic, my husband Jewish, but I knew that on this day, I needed to check to make sure my baby would be written in the Book of Life. Alone I went. This time the doctor wasn't joking around; we both knew that it was a possibility. Even though, same as last time, every test looked perfect and the previous sonogram had showed a healthy fetus, I just wasn't as sick. But it was more than that. It was some deeply-rooted, intuitive connection to this beginning life that shadowed my visit. And my fears were confirmed with this final sonogram that again showed that tiny fetus with a heart now stilled. In the end, hyperemesis was my salvation. My body's way of maintaining and preserving life. Michael was born at 8 pounds, 21 inches. My first baby, first birth, first experience with natural childbirth, with no anesthesia. I didn't go into it intending to be brave; 26 years ago, epidurals commonly caused nausea and vomiting. During one of my last OB visits, the female doctor sympathetically nodded, recalling how she vomited during the labor and birth of her baby. That was enough for me. I could take pain, I just couldn't bear another minute of nausea and vomiting. I had no idea. Hours in, there was a millisecond moment when I thought I would mentally splinter from the pain, imagining myself fracturing all over the walls. In that millisecond I pulled myself back up, concentrated on a spot on the wall and just breathed. Here is the miracle: The minute the baby was out of my body, illness was gone. I felt fabulous, on top of the world, a high like no other. A healthy, perfect baby boy was born. And with his birth, like the snap of a finger -- the cessation of sickness -- an instant return to exuberant health. And so it was for each of my babies. Michael, Nicholas, Laura. The instant they were born, so was I. Borne into motherhood, each child has been the gift of my life, hyperemesis gravidarum a small price to pay for the immeasurable joy of creating a family.For more on pregnancy, click here. "

The study highlights the results of 1,100 telephone interviews among adults ages 18 and older.In 2011, 50 percent of people felt that the country was “still in a recession,” but this year that number decreased to 37 percent, according to Deloitte’s 2012 Annual Holiday Survey. Deloitte also found that the portion of shoppers intending to spend “more or the same” increased to 63 percent this year, surpassing the 59 percent seen before the recession.Consumer confidence skyrocketed to its highest level in seven months according to Bloomberg’s latest Consumer Comfort survey, released Nov. 29. Optimism about making purchases reflects the sentiments of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernake, who declared on Nov. 23 that next year could be “a very good one for the American economy.”The American Research Group study also found that shoppers who say they will pay full price, rather than wait until an item goes on sale, plan to spend almost double what they did in 2007. In contrast, bargain hunters who will buy only on sale plan to spend $593 this year, compared to the $805 they planned to spend in 2007.The discrepancy between high rollers and sale-savvy spenders may speak to an increasing gap between how the rich and the poor perceive spending. According to a Nov. 21 study by the Consumer Federation of America, only 11 percent of those with incomes under $25,000 said they would spend more during the holidays, while 18 percent of respondents with incomes over $100,000 said they planned to increase holiday spending. Among the low-income earners, a mere 21 percent said their financial situation was better this year compared to 30 percent of the highest earners.With a majority of Americans saying they feel more optimistic about holiday spending, overspending and holiday shopping debt becomes a main concern. The average U.S. credit card debt per borrower already increased 4.9 percent from July to September, with fewer Americans making payments on time, and overconfidence in holiday spending will likely exacerbate the issue. Finance expert Suze Orman suggests paying for gifts only in cash and giving more homemade presents. Setting a budget for your holiday spending and discussing holiday shopping plans with your family can also help, Bankrate writes."

But, people are speculating about where the royal baby was conceived, what the princess should eat, the name of the royal baby, the maternity styles we will see, so it is not surprising that our endless appetite for royal gossip on both sides of the pond has fueled twin talk.With this speculation about twins, though, comes the misconceptions about twin zygosity and twin inheritance that have persisted (she could have twins because William's uncle Charles has identical twins!), even among skilled medical professionals, even as twins have become much more common, increasing 76% over the past 30 years to 3.3% of births in the U.S.In 2004, when I was pregnant with twins, after the dropping of the jaws and the widening of the eyes and the ""What are you talking about, I am not having twins!"" part was out of the way, doctors told me I had two sacs and two placentas, so the twins were fraternal. Those doctors are not alone -- in a 2004 study, 81% of doctors said they thought two placentas meant fraternal twins. There were no twins that I knew of in my family, but my husband has some twins in his. My grandmother asked me why I took fertility drugs while I was in law school (I didn't). Other family members said for sure it must be my husband's family's influence.At the time, I did not think about it much -- I was taking the bar, and then I was a first-year associate at a law firm pregnant with twins, so I didn't have time for many thoughts extraneous to immediate tasks at hand (topping the list: eating when I finally was able to and billing hours). And then, when the twin girls were born over 10 weeks early and were in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for two frightening months, questions of their zygosity were put on the back burner as we attended to the more important issues of digesting and breathing. But at some point, as many moms of same sex (even different sex) twins can relate, after the fifth question that day about whether your twins are identical, you really want to know whether your kids share the same DNA. About a month after they came home and their health stabilized, as I was pumping breast milk for them, I started to do some research about identical and fraternal twins. My babies looked the same and had the same blood type -- could they be identical? Why did I have twins, anyway? Because of the babies' paternal twin great aunts? If I had another baby would I have an increased chance of having twins again? One thing is clear. Two placentas did not mean that my same-sex twins were fraternal. Researchers say that 25-30% of identical twins have two placentas -- meaning, in layman's terms, the fertilized egg split early. According to the New York Times, a British study conducted earlier this year found that about 15% of twin parents studied were misinformed about the zygosity of their twins (i.e. whether their twins were identical or fraternal).What about ""twin genes""? Fraternal twins who are conceived without artificial intervention are often the result of hyperovulation, a genetic trait the mother inherits that causes her to ovulate multiple eggs. (Sorry, dads, you don't ovulate.) Researchers also think fraternal twins are more common in older women.Why a fertilized egg splits -- resulting in identical twins -- remains a mystery. There does not seem to be a genetic component. The general twin rate has skyrocketed, due mainly to fertility treatments which increase the chance of fraternal twins, but the rate of identical twins has remained relatively constant at about 3 in 1000, half as common as fraternal twins. It looks like Prince William's family history has no bearing on whether his wife has twins. And, contrary to popular belief, it is impossible to tell if same-sex twins are identical without a DNA test. When my twins were 4 months old, I had them tested through a genetic testing service. I swabbed their cheeks with a cotton swab and sent the samples back to the lab. The lab said they were monozygotic. My egg had split, no thanks to my or my husband's family history. (My grandmother insists I must have at least taken too many vitamins.)At 8 years old, my twins look a bit different -- one is taller; one wears glasses with a mild prescription. If I had to guess now, I would have thought they were fraternal. Turns out that genes are complicated things -- they may express themselves differently or mutate.I did not want to guess, though. I wanted to know my twins' zygosity as best I could, not just because I wanted to answer the constant questioners, but because I wanted to know myself. And perhaps this knowledge will help them if they encounter any health issues in the future as genetic research advances. The fact that I had only one egg also eased my mind a bit when I decided to go for a second pregnancy, which, thankfully, was not twins.That is not to say having twins is not an incredible and singular experience -- it is. And if the princess does have twins, the twin mom club will welcome her. Can't wait to see the designer double stroller."

The Red Hook area remains without power or water 5 days after Superstorm Sandy. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c95472100003300c52e8e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On a recent Friday, a psychiatrist and a team of medical students traveled to the Far Rockaways in Queens to provide mental health assistance to survivors of Hurricane Sandy. Their work did not involve psychotherapy sessions and diagnoses but rather tending to the immediate needs of survivors.The medical team arrived in response to a request from ""Occupy Sandy Relief,"" an outgrowth of Occupy Wall Street formed to help survivors of the hurricane. At the heart of a vast public housing complex outside the community center, the medical team found people lined up expectantly under the watchful eyes of Guardian Angels, a band of ex-gang members who that day were providing equally grassroots security.Inside, the volunteers met a local community leader who told them that they needed to be ready as the center opened its doors for people to come in to get warm; have a meal; and get supplies like blankets, baby diapers and food for their sodden and freezing homes.Within less than an hour, a makeshift clinic had risen up in the corner of what had been a children's play area, using the medical supplies and basic medications that Sandy Relief staff had shuttled over.The medical team saw over 30 adults and children in the chaotic afternoon that followed. The main complaints they heard were of headaches and dizziness, likely from the many mysterious fumes that had filled the air of their stricken buildings, upper respiratory infections that developed amid unheated apartments and waterlogged and moldy mattresses, and unfilled prescription refills.This type of care, known as ""psychological first aid,"" or PFA, does not resemble typical mental health treatment, but it comes as a result of a changed understanding of what survivors need immediately after disasters. PFA is the best post-disaster mental health response we have, so far, for the pervasive distress that occurs in the wake of a disaster -- what is known as the ""normal response to an abnormal event.""PFA emerged as a disaster response out of concerns about the scattershot types of mental health interventions that were provided after 9/11.One particular concern was whether well-meaning mental health responders were causing more harm than good by psychologically ""de-briefing"" survivors. Psychological de-briefing encouraged victims to talk about their 9/11 experiences, often too soon, too openly, or too unwillingly. Experience and subsequent studies soon began to suggest that this approach was re-traumatizing some of those who simply needed relief, not recovered memories, that it was no time to open wounds that need to heal.[1]PFA was developed by professional consensus, drawn from the available evidence base and the collective wisdom of these experts.From 9/11 and other U.S. and international human-made and natural disasters, mental health experts have accrued a body of knowledge from clinical experience about treatment that is safe and that may be effective in the wake of a traumatic event. They synthesize this knowledge into guidelines for ""evidence informed"" care that is used to direct professional and public health efforts.Although evidence gathered in this fashion seldom meets the rigorous parameters of a randomized control study, for disaster mental health, the conditions as well as the financial support for controlled studies are very limited.Disaster responders, whether mental health professionals or not, need to be familiar with PFA. PFA does not preclude implementing traditional mental health interventions like psychotherapy (especially cognitive-behavioral therapy) and medication, but it also does not promote them. Instead, it leads with the universe of concerns and actions vital to all who suffer trauma, like medical care, food, shelter, reliable information, and the support of people they know and trust. In this way, PFA is far, far more immediate and broader than the traditional psychological interventions in the quiver of the mental health professional.The idea is that in the immediate aftermath of a disaster, people will feel better if they are provided with essentials. Some disaster survivors, including those at the Far Rockaways community center, will need specialized mental health care. But first, they need to be free of environmentally-induced headaches, to sleep on dry mattresses, to eat and have their overcharged nervous systems quiet down. Psychological ""problems"" often have non-psychological solutions.In many ways, PFA represents the instinctive response of a community to a crisis. It is striking, for instance, that a newspaper called Resources -- Sandy Relief that was distributed in affected areas of south Brooklyn, south Queens, and Staten Island had as its November 7 front page just eight items in stark, large print: ""Disaster Unemployment,"" ""Staying Warm,"" ""Emergency SNAP [food stamp] Benefits,"" ""FEMA Disaster Relief,"" ""Cleaning Up,"" ""NY is Hiring!"" ""Shelters and Care,"" and ""Food and Supplies."" These items sound a lot like the core areas of PFA, a remarkable overlap.[2]Although everyone knows of medical first aid like that provided at the Far Rockaways community center, few know about PFA even when it's happening. The message to affected communities should be clear: Your emotional world can and should be addressed in ways small and sometimes big, even when the world around you has become so demanding of your attention.Disasters are becoming increasingly frequent around the globe. As we learn from Hurricane Sandy, more evidence-informed practices will emerge. In the meantime, PFA gives relief workers a common sense, safe, readily learnable and demonstrably effective means of responding to the pain and suffering they will encounter.References:1.

(AP Photo/Robert F. Bukaty)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c95962100003000c52eb8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The space between the moment you learn you are pregnant and the one when you reveal that to the wider world is the most intimate time in a woman's life. You are quite literally carrying a secret. There are very practical reasons not to tell -- risk of miscarriage is highest in the first trimester and many women don't want to reveal news that might change -- but there are also poetic and emotional ones. You need time to get your bearings, adjust to an altered reality, and savor the in-between: woman to mother to family. Kate Middleton and Prince William had just a wisp of that time. I obviously don't know who was told when, but there are hints that until Kate became violently ill a few days ago, their news was known only by the parents-to-be. ""Such was the level of secrecy,"" wrote Tom Sykes on The Royalist blog at the Daily Beast, ""that before this weekend, the only people who knew were William and Kate themselves."" Her parents realized their daughter was pregnant when she began vomiting uncontrollably during an overnight stay. The Queen and Prince Charles were called just before William drove his wife to the hospital. Harry was told via email. Now the whole world knows. The Church of England is praying for the Duchess, who is suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, the most dangerous form of morning sickness. Radio stations are playing prank calls to her hospital room. (That call is worth another outraged column all its own. Really?) Illness has forced their hand, and I imagine they feel that as a loss. Yes, I know, the spotlight comes with the job description. (Technically, becoming pregnant and birthing an heir essentially is the job description.) And yes, of course, Kate understood she was trading her privacy for that lovely sapphire ring. But still. It is said that motherhood is something you can not fully understand until you inhabit it. The same is true of pregnancy. So knowing the world will be watching must be very different than living it. I told no one but my husband and my doctor when my first pregnancy test turned positive. For months it was a secret I carried everywhere, like a talisman. Sometimes it thrilled and comforted; sometimes it terrified. In a much wanted pregnancy new life takes form during those months -- in the silent looks between partners, and in the invisible thrum of change beneath the skin. The second time around I shared the news more quickly. Already caring for a toddler, I was all the more exhausted, and telling friends and family allowed me to ask for help. I was also less nervous about the telling. My chances of loss were higher with age, true, but so was my realization that I would need the support of people I loved if something bad were to happen, so I might as well let them in on the secret early. Both times, though, the announcement was on my terms. The news was mine to share. There is something jarringly public about the later months of any pregnancy -- you trumpet the most personal of life events to strangers just by walking down the street -- which is why it's all the more delicious to keep things somewhat to yourself. It makes sense that art historians regularly speculate over whether Mona Lisa was pregnant when she posed. That enigmatic smile? The secret, the power of it, feels just like that. No one took this from Kate Middleton, but she lost it. That should make all of us a little sad.Also on HuffPost Parents:"

From the holiday ham to a sleigh full of toys, our shopping bags are full. And with so many retailers competing for your cash, you're sure to bag a bargain or two throughout the month.But holiday shopping aside, there are a few other little bonus items that you'll find especially good to buy this month -- these items truly are December's best buys.Football tickets: Baby, it's cold outside. But here's the upside -- discount football tickets. Fewer fans are willing to sit through a winter game, especially when their team has no chance of going to the playoffs. But stadiums still need to fill the seats. Bonus Tip: The closer you are to kickoff, the better the deals. If you're okay with last minute plans, wait to purchase tickets till 24 hours before (unless it's likely to be a sell-out).Champagne: Welcome to champagne season! Expect deals through New Year's Eve, but don't limit yourself to champagne. Only sparkling wines produced in a specific region of France can earn the ""champagne"" label, making it rare. So consider less expensive sparkling wine alternative like Italy's Prosecco or Spain's Cava.Oysters: Have you heard the old adage, ""Only buy oysters in months with the letter 'r.'"" Historically, this was because oysters weren't as safe to eat in warm months. However, this is no longer the case due to modern technology and harvesting techniques. However, during warm months, oysters spawn and they become soft and fleshy, so for the best quality, buy plump, rich, flavorful oysters this month.Seasonal meats: While they can be eaten anytime of year, certain meats just have a holiday reputation and they tend to take up a lot of freezer real estate. We're talking frozen turkeys, ham and prime rib. So look for even lower prices right after a holiday when demand is down and grocers want them out of the way.Electronics: This may sound like a no-brainer, but take it one step further and buy electronics on Mondays in December. Typically, this is when manufacturers apply discounts, which benefit the retailer, who in turn passes savings on to the consumer. During December, up the ante with major shopping days like Green Monday on December 10th and Free Shipping Day on December 17th.Final tip: Prices on many gift items will drop the week before Christmas, but remember -- inventory will be picked over. If there is a toy or electronic you just have to get, then shop now. Otherwise, a little procrastination could save you money."
