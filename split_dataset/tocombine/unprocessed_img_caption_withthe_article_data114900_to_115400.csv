0,QUEER VOICES,'True Blood' Star Sounds Off On Co-Star's Alleged Refusal To Play Gay Role,JamesMichael Nichols,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nelsan-ellis-true-blood_n_5609620.html,,2014-07-22,"HOLLYWOOD, CA - MAY 30: Actor Nelsan Ellis arrives at the Premiere of HBO's 'True Blood' 5th Season at ArcLight Cinemas Cinerama Dome on May 30, 2012 in Hollywood, California. (Photo by Frazer Harrison/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c9a8abf2a000051034f7239.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Finally someone said what we've all been thinking.When ""True Blood"" star Luke Grimes reportedly quit rather than play a gay role opposite Nelsan Ellis in the cult favorite television show, the irony seemed pretty apparent. ""True Blood"" is without a doubt one of the queerest shows currently on television, and one couldn't help but wonder what Grimes thought he was getting himself into when he initially came on as a cast member.Now, Ellis is opening up about his own thoughts surrounding Grimes' departure -- and he has a few choice words for the actor. When asked by New York Magazine's Vulture site if he'd had the opportunity to ""talk to or bond"" with Grimes, Ellis responded in part, ""I didn't, but I'm completely ... I mean, I can say I'm not going to make a comment, but I just think that, you're an actor, you're an actor on a show that's ""True Blood,"" we're all sitting there going, ""You quit your job because ... really?"" I'm just... I'm over him. You quit your job because you don't want to play a gay part?...""When pushed further, Ellis elaborated on his feelings....You make a statement when you do something like that... If you have a child, if you have a son, and he comes out as gay, what are you going to do? If you have a daughter who comes out gay ...? You just made a statement, and it has ripple effects... I can't approach a character with judgment. I certainly can't tell my boss, ""I can act what I want to act, but not what you tell me to act,"" especially on a show where you come in, knowing what it is... I didn't like what he did because he made a statement, and sometimes you have to take responsibility.Grimes made headlines late last month when he left ""True Blood"" over reported ""creative differences."" However, it later came to light that he reportedly quit because the season seven script included a queer romance plot line between his character and Ellis's.(h/t Instinct)"
1,RELIGION,Nose Deep in Their Own... Prejudice: Hinduism and The New York Times' Sewage Problem,"Vamsee Juluri, ContributorUSF professor; author, 'Saraswati's Intelligence: Part 1 of Th...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nose-deep-in-their-own-pr_b_5601260.html,"What might have been an excellent piece of reporting on an important public-health concern in India has turned out instead to be one of the most absurd, far-fetched, and ugly pieces of Hinduphobic racism in journalism ever.",2014-07-22,"New York Times Co. signage is displayed on the company's building in New York, U.S., on Wednesday, April 27, 2011.

After being told for several years now that Hinduism is to blame for everything in India from the gang rape of women to the mere questioning of Wendy Doniger's strange claims, The New York Times now reveals to us that it is ""some ancient Hindu texts"" that are at least partly responsible for unhygienic excretory practices and diseases in modern India. As further proof of this incredible thesis, we are also told that Muslim children have a better survival rate because they are discriminated against and forced to live in separate slums, safe from the Hindus' less-hygienic habitats. Even the opening line of the article evokes a picture of Hindu superstition, spelling out the sad story of a boy whose mother's attempts to ward off the ""evil eye"" have obviously failed to stop the disease from coming. The point of the article seems to be this: Hindus don't use toilets because it's against their religion, and it's spreading disease.Once again, let us remind ourselves. This is not some 18th-century colonizer's pamphlet tucked in between bio-warfare blankets. It is The New York Times, and in the year 2014 at that. And of course, given The New York Times' eminence, a reader in the comments section has already asked the only question left to ask by such an argument: Do you have any recommendations on which religion I ought to convert to from Hinduism? Should it be Islam or Christianity? The irony, of course, appears to have been lost.The tragedy of this new low in Hinduphobic fantasizing is that the concerns the article raises are very important ones (see Dr. Raman Khanna's critique ""The New York Times' Fecal Load of Hinduphobia"" here). When an important journalistic institution like the Times devotes the resources needed to place a professional on the field in South Asia, and devotes all the diligence required to produce an otherwise well-informed analysis of a serious and tragic public-health concern, why is it so difficult to pause and consider how damaging, and indeed self-defeating, this kind of bizarre and baseless commentary might be? Does a journalist not have a professional responsibility to ascertain facts? Is there the slightest evidence anywhere -- anthropological, journalistic, historical, or even anecdotal -- that Hindus follow some kind of ancient religious code in deciding where to do their thing? Can a self-respecting writer seriously expect to get away with an assertion like that?I would still like to think that it is not ""intentional"" racism that perhaps leads someone to make claims of such an absurdly racist nature. As a media scholar writing about a media professional's actions here, it would not be appropriate for me to assume what his personal intentions might have been. Let us therefore presume for a moment that there is indeed some connection between Hinduism and public disease in India; there are a lot of Hindus in India, and there is a lot of sanitation-related disease going around in India, just like how there are a lot of people of many different religions in the world, and there are a lot of different diseases going around in the world. Now, if the health issue in question were one directly related to a religious practice, like, let us say, a condition related to a religiously sanctioned dietary custom (food coma and Christmas, let us say, for fun), then the claim of a religion and health connection would stand and would be worth debating seriously. But Hinduism and where one goes to toilet? I have yet to think of a time when I heard any of India's 1 billion Hindus say, ""Let's go squat by that river, where God X once went,"" or, ""Let's not go to that World Bank-built plumbing contraption, where God Y told us not to."" In fact, the only toilet-related custom I have heard of is that you wash not only your hands but also your feet after you go -- a bit of a contradiction with that old Sesame Street song that goes something like, ""We wash our hands before we eat, but we don't wash our feet before we eat"" -- a point that sometimes led to productive cross-cultural debates with my grandmother. (The insistence was probably a relic from the days when they all used to eat on the floor and not on dining tables.)The point is this:We have had hygiene inscribed into our bodies, minds and lives in ways that today's Hinduphobic discourse cannot understand and, equally sadly, India's present infrastructure cannot support. It is unfortunate that some of the most obvious facts have to be stated aloud here, but think about it. Have you seen an Indian concert with a mosh pit up front? Have you seen a Bollywood song with images of dark, dirty toilets like those '90s grunge music videos? The only example one might think of is the sewage-jumping scene in Slumdog Millionaire, which, frankly, had less to do with India than the fantasy world of a media culture that has, among other things, depicted the glory of a junky plunging into a filthy bar's filthy toilet to retrieve his stash, and, of course, consummated reunion with human waste in adorable antics like ""poo-diving.""I am mixing real life and movies and television for a reason. The Hindu sense of the sacred, the aesthetic, and cleanliness are all deeply rooted in our history. We might have a serious infrastructural crisis in India today when it comes to sanitation, but it is not a cultural issue. We are not drawn to filth, not even in our movies, and much less in real life. We had a Great Bath in Mohenjo-daro when people elsewhere were presumably still dealing with Great Bogs. We had hygiene, and we had religion. Each had its place, and today, trodden badly under the circumstances of postcolonial degradation and apathy, somehow each still survives, somewhat. The real danger of the Times' most recent cheap shot at Hinduism is not so much that it perpetuates an old Katherine Mayo-style arrogance about the heathens and hurts modern Indians' self-perception. It perpetuates something far worse, something that is historically and at least partially and indirectly responsible for the terrible sanitary conditions that millions of people in India face today. It is not Hinduism but Hinduphobia that has caused this mess, for Hinduphobia is no mere attitude problem. Like racism, like orientalism, it is a vast and centuries-old complex of lies, projections, deceptions, hypocricies, and cruelties, as well as actions, aggressions, and policies that have severely damaged, if not completely destroyed, an enormous civilizational investment in a sense of propriety over self, body, other, society, and nature. You can call that Hinduism, or Indian civilization, or maybe just good sense as it once existed in most parts of Earth. But the truth is this: Four hundred years of colonialism (maybe more, depending on how you wish to analyze this, and how honestly you wish to analyze this) have broken humanity's ways of being in nature and with nature in more ways than today's mass-mediated pop-culture common sense can hold a light up to.If you were to read Hindu thought, read it seriously, from the Upanishads through the Gita all the way to its most recent interpreters, whether Vivekananda or the Mahatma, you will find a civilization dedicated to nothing less than mastery over one's own self, to the cultivation of an exalted sense of spirit rooted not in superstition or tall tales of mythical afterlives but simply in the duties and obligations of the present, duties and obligations that are as much about the material, the social, and the civic as they are about the spiritual and the mystical. To put it in simple terms: Hindu scriptures don't stoop to spell out where to go, how to go, or how often to go, but they will inspire you to celebrate your intelligence, your vast potential as a sentient being to apprehend all nature's ways and rhythms, so you will be able to use your reason, not blind belief, to practice all parts of life and living, including hygiene, in the best way possible. And yet, it is true that the present we live in today is dismal. Hygiene in India is a personal privilege rather than a civic reality. What are the reasons for this? We cannot pretend the last 400 years of colonialism and plunder did not take place and simply say, ""This is the way it always is in the benighted third world."" At the same time, we cannot blame Europe or America for the way things are now; that is a reality too. But throwing aside all the Marxism-hued dreams of smashing imperialism on one hand, or free-market fantasies of shopping malls and airports popping up everywhere and lifting the world out of poverty on the other, we have to recognize the persistence of one massive, ugly, pernicious cause, a disease of the heart and of the mind as foul as the stench of the sewage that stains the water of the Ganga. Hinduphobia is a reality, and it is a problem. You have to understand one thing now: If India has to clean up its act again, both literally and culturally, you will have to recognize that this persistent and totally baseless denigration of its intellectual and civilizational heritage is not going to help. You perhaps cannot fathom how low the spiritual morale and civilizational imagination of an ancient people is when they have to settle for something like this planet-heating, plastic-shedding global capitalism, for these trinkets of selfish material gratification in islands of gated-community prosperity surrounded by impoverished slums and villages suffocating in sewage. No. If India's ""elites"" have abdicated their responsibility to its masses since the 1990s, as critics claim, if India's masses have no room to go each day, all of this is not a sign of some religious underdevelopment. It is the outcome of a massive denial of cultural, philosophical and spiritual self-sovereignty, first by British colonialism and then by Hinduphobia disguised as secularism. Mahatma Gandhi warned us about blindly copying modernity's violence and spiritual denial in Hind Swaraj. His prescription might have sounded too anti-modern, a village fantasy, perhaps, not strong enough on fighting the injustice of caste (and yet stronger than most Hindus' position at that time). But the goal is still the same. It is swa-raj (self-rule). That's what India has always been about, for all and not just for some. And if achieving that will mean completely refuting, rejecting, resisting, and indeed flushing Hinduphobia out of the minds of civilized society and respectable conversation, so be it, thathastu. What The New York Times and its stunted vision does not yet recognize is that what we are doing right now is nothing less than remaking our minds, our hearts, our deepest sense of what it means to be sovereign over ourselves again. And this is not some right-wing imperial fantasy about some ancient glory past. Every issue in India is not about Hindus and Muslims, except in the loopy, divide-and-denigrate universe of The New York Times. The present moment in Hindu history is about India, and it is about what it means to be in the world as a human, an agent of history, and a sentient being capable of seeing suffering and ending it. The civilizational aspiration that exists in India today ceased to be a fantasy the day Narendra Modi stood at the banks of the Ganga in Kashi and said public sanitation is how this will all begin. It may be a fantastically difficult task to undo what centuries of colonialism or 66 years of post-independence malaise, apathy and corruption have done to India. But today's India is speaking about its soul again in a way it has not done in a very long time. The real decolonization is beginning now."

How can the streets we walk, the people we see, and the corner establishments we frequent be so impactful on our happiness?",2014-07-22,2014-07-16-LincolnMemorialReflectedWashingtonDCWallpaper.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-16-LincolnMemorialReflectedWashingtonDCWallpaper-thumb.jpg,"I think we all laughed a little when Carrie Bradshaw exclaimed that she was dating New York City. I mean, it seems an entirely ridiculous thing to consider that is is possible to have a relationship in the place in which you are living, right? How can the place we live be comparable to say a boyfriend or a girlfriend? How can the streets we walk, the people we see, and the corner establishments we frequent be so impactful on our happiness? Taking a step back and giving Ms. Bradshaw a chance, I am becoming more and more convinced that she was on to something. The first time I felt like I was in a relationship with my city was when I was living in Paris earlier this fall. But come on, who wouldn't fall in love with such a spectacular place. Living in the seventh arrondissement and attending school with the preppiest and prettiest of Frenchies, all the while exploring the history and culture of France encapsulated a relationship that forever changed my soul. It moved me and it influenced me. And though my time was short there, like an incredible affair, it meant so very much.This year at UCLA was one of the most challenging by far. I lost a lot of friends and a lot of love that I took for granted, and found myself left with nothing but a feeling of emptiness. It's funny, when looking at someone like me, with plenty of credentials and a strong exterior, it doesn't seem likely that self-doubt or fear could be at play. And yet, I was drowning. I didn't have as many friends as before, and I was living in an environment that was the opposite of what anyone wants or needs at the transitional age of twenty. I had too much on my plate, and had lost sight of the world around me. I was no longer available to my environment and became all too consumed with the negativity that penetrated it. If you want a better insight into what I mean, just take a good look at my rap sheet starting with President. Should you ever meet someone who chooses to be President of her sorority, or even President of his fraternity, you owe it to that person to give them a hug, a medal, and maybe even a good cry in reverence for all that they have had to put up with. I've gotten my fair share of hugs, and cried more times than I care to admit, but I must say, I'm still waiting on that medal. I was handed criticism after criticism. I was constantly playing a game of keeping my head above water, all while managing two other jobs, a relationship, and that little thing they call school. A dear friend named Preston once told me, that after running his fraternity for almost a year, he knows he can run any business and manage every kind of personality. That boy could not have said it better. It has been the greatest burden of my college career, but the single most important challenge from which I will grow to be a better person and leader. After it all now, I'm in a new place. Not just emotionally, but physically and geographically too. In our lives, we will find ourselves broken down from time to time. And when it all seems lost, and all seems too hard, we will somehow find it in ourselves to rebuild. I have found that growth is made possible sometimes by starting new relationships to learn new lessons and regain the strength that we had once lost. And so, I have started a new relationship with my new city: Washington D.C.Interning for a powerful female Senator and living with three independent young women, I find myself free to fall in love with the most powerful city in the world. I'm no longer closed off to people or my environment. I'm available and open to the possibility of each and every day, and my heart grows more and more full of love and light for my new home. And though the relationship is still very new, it has potential. Our dates are fun, and adventurous, with plenty of spontaneity to go around. Walking along the brick sidewalks of Georgetown into the wee hours of the night. Attending rooftop parties and wandering around former ambassador's homes with old friends and new. Reading a new book in the park and embracing the feverish humidity. Temporarily worshiping a new baseball team and buying a Nationals hat to wear grocery shopping or to yoga. Meeting the only person in Washington who isn't interested in politics. Sipping coffee with women you hope to one day be: future lawyers and lobbyists teeming with ambition and wisdom. And hey, there's nothing like working with a million young men in suits that will really put a bounce in your step on the way to work in the mornings. It is all so new and refreshing. Every day there is something to learn and to see, and often when we lose ourselves in the unknown, we find our way back to who we always were.You see, when we allow ourselves to give in to new places, we open the door to new possibilities. We start to take greater risks to better ourselves and become the people we really want to be. Sometimes, it is only a matter of location that need set us straight. What is it they always say? ""Location. Location. Location!"" For me in this moment, I am indeed having a relationship with my city, and my current home. Maybe Carrie wasn't so nutty after all. Maybe somehow in the midst of all those questionable wardrobe choices, she managed to get this part right. And yet, in the moments when I find myself thinking of the way I was before coming to this city, and the way things were, I smile a little and look up at the world around me. I look at my current love, the city I'm in, and I no longer think of the way things are. I only ever focus on what will be."

We know our professor would randomly ""drop the needle"" on records during our final exam, challenging us to identify a composition and its composer by its structure, instrumentation, motifs and harmony. The music library of our generation was a room with 12-inch records, record players, and headphones. There was some great bonding that came from roaming the small library, stretching our headphone cords all the while, comparing notes on our strategies to recognize open fifths, plagal cadences, Mozart's use of the clarinet, or Stravinsky's ""Petrushka"" chord. In the end, one learned to recognize the compositional attributes that made a piece a chanson, a sonata, a recitative, through-composed, atonal, and so on. You were trying to make sense of an aural landscape having been dropped in the middle of it. It was very exciting, stressful, and chaotic.In much the same way I am trying to make sense of our era during a sabbatical from my day-to-day responsibilities at Marymount California University. I had committed early on to trying to get up-to-date on literature regarding wellness, resilience and disruptive innovation. I started this week with a pile of New Yorker magazines, trying to ease myself back with a predictably high-quality publication that offers the occasional cartoon chuckle. I got lucky because, over the course of a couple of issues, I got a sense of how the American higher education sector feels about disruptive innovation. Disruption theory comes from the business literature, but it has been co-opted by other sectors as it provides a framing device that helps us make sense of the fast-paced 21st century. Harvard professor Jill Lepore's article, ""The Disruption Machine,"" along with the letters to the editor that followed, goes after the theory put forward by her Harvard colleague, Clayton M. Christensen. While some subscribe to the theory as a way to identify successful companies, Lepore plays the contrarian, sharing that theory is really about how things go wrong: ""Disruption is a theory of change founded on panic, anxiety, and shaky evidence... a competitive strategy for an age seized by terror."" Lepore takes the reader through the ages (enlightenment, reason, industrial, evolution, technology) to support an argument that we see our current age as an era ""founded on a profound anxiety about financial collapse... and an apocalyptic fear of global devastation."" Lepore portrays the disruption ethic as applied in modern business as: ""Forget rules, obligations, your conscience, loyalty, a sense of the commonweal. Don't look back. Never pause. Disrupt or be disrupted... the time has come to panic as you've never panicked before."" Many academics weighed in on Lepore's article over the last month. The University of Maryland's David B. Siclia challenged disruption theory when citing Alfred D. Chandler's research that found successful companies evolved a great deal, but ""without self-cannibalizing their hard-won know-how for the sake of change."" UT Arlington's Kathryn Hamilton Warren wondered why ""the idea that something that works must be changed for change's sake -- and that change in and of itself is seen as progress -- is an economic driver."" There are a good number of points of view about the Lepore vs. Christensen debate to be found online if you are interested.Why is it important for us to contemplate this debate? Disruption theory is now so pervasive that it presents itself to our students in the classroom and when they enter their professions. University presidents and newspaper editors are being dislodged from their appointments for ""failing to be disruptively innovative,"" as Lepore puts it. Politicians and influential thought leaders have predetermined that the same technologies that provided us with the ""Angry Birds"" app will revolutionize higher education. University graduates have ambitions of becoming entrepreneurs who will disrupt their chosen industry, create great value in a new company, and then sell it. Disruption theory correctly observes that many businesses ultimately fail because they are not organized in a manner that easily allows for adaptation to rapidly changing environments. Quite simply, the ones that succeed do so when they provide products or services that society desires to buy or support. Successful organizations are always developing new products or services, relying on the law of averages to play out. Some things will succeed and some will fail, but organizations need to resource the development of new initiatives knowing that not all will fly. In other words, organizations resource failure. In an ""on demand"" culture, it is quite understandable that most feel that ""failure is not an option,"" but that runs counter to everything we know about human learning and development, and, of course, university research. Finding information or data no longer challenges young professionals, but are they equipped to discern what is significant in the seemingly endless supply of information pouring out of the Internet fire hydrant?In recent years American higher education has absorbed national conversations about MOOC's, Title IX, for-profit colleges, accountability, and unacceptable graduation rates. Our society is conflicted about economic stratification, immigration, wars in the Middle East, and global warming. All of this is happening while universities are trying to preserve what they have done really well for nearly for a thousand years: putting students in classrooms with faculty who can inspire them about what it means to be human. Environments where character formation is at the heart of the enterprise.Higher education's entire value proposition is seriously being reconsidered by modern society, often because it is not considered innovative enough. Picture the stress of the modern world relentlessly pressing in against the four walls of university classrooms, beckoning students to forego the undergraduate degree with the siren songs of venture capitalism, creating value, making one's ""nut"" by the age of 30, etc. Is this an era of disruption? There can be little doubt that the constant barrage of infotainment influences how we perceive personal and societal circumstances. Do we have time to reflect on what we are learning from our families, our colleagues, our students and our research? For some unknown reason I took breaks from my work today to learn that there are Internet followers who believe Steven Spielberg has killed dinosaurs; that snorting ground-up rhinoceros horn was trendy in Vietnam; and that the walnuts I had ordered from Amazon were on the delivery vehicle making their way to my mailbox. Did I need to know any of this? Is this what ""dropping the needle"" is now for me? What is different from the records that our faculty assembled in that old music library and the infotainment that technological innovation is delivering to me all the time? Is this what disruption feels like?"
6,IMPACT,Food Supplies for Refugees in Cameroon Dangerously Low,"William Lambers, ContributorAuthor, 'Ending World Hunger' Feeding America Blogger Council,...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/food-supplies-for-refugee_b_5587679.html,,2014-07-22,2014-07-15-CAR_20140221_WFPMelissa_Chemam_0025_edited1.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-15-CAR_20140221_WFPMelissa_Chemam_0025_edited1-thumb.jpg," By taking action now we can save refugees from starvation in Africa. This includes over 100,000 war victims from the Central African Republic (CAR) who have fled to Cameroon. Tragically, funding for humanitarian aid is low at a time when people need it the most. The refugees are having to walk for days or even weeks just to cross the border. They have little or no food on this journey, and they sometimes need to hide from militia groups. They may escape the violence, but hunger is constantly with them. Félicité Tchibindat, UNICEF Representative in Cameroon, says, ""Children who have survived the horror in the Central African Republic are now at risk of dying from malnutrition and its complications. Death is stalking these children. It is alarming to see entire families undernourished - including older children and women.""The United Nations says about 1 in 3 children among the refugees are suffering from malnutrition. They are in an extremely weakened condition. Malnutrition will cause lasting physical and mental damage in children, or even death. Since January, UNICEF has been providing small children therapeutic food and milk to save their lives. However, the UN children's agency does not have all the required funds for its Cameroon mission. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) feeds children an enriched peanut paste called Plumpy'Sup. This food, along with Super Cereal, helps children fight off the potentially deadly malnutrition. The WFP can only have a supply of these life-saving foods through voluntary donations from the international community. There is just not enough funding right now with all the humanitarian emergencies taking place. We are experiencing the most refugees globally since World War II. Funding levels for hunger relief have to increase dramatically now to avoid starvation in Africa and the Middle East. Food pipeline breaks are already occurring in Uganda and other places. Refugees in Cameroon, especially children, will be the next to suffer because the world did not act timely enough. Gian Carlo Cirri of WFP says there is only enough food to last till September. No other funding has come in to refill the pipeline thereafter. A massive hunger catastrophe is on the road ahead in Cameroon. Martin Penner, currently with WFP in Cameroon says, ""We need funding now. That's because it can take 4 months or more for a donation to be converted into food being handed out at a distribution site. That's especially true when you are talking about the nutrition products we need for the refugees (PlumpySup and SuperCereal).""The situation will only get worse with more refugees fleeing the Central African Republic. Penner adds, ""we expect more to come. The situation inside CAR is not getting any better. We expect the number to reach 180,000 by year's end. It's currently at 106,000 since January.""WFP has a fundraising campaign called CAR Can't Wait. We have to stay ahead of the famine in Africa. If we don't act now, lives will be lost. We have to make sure the pipeline of food remains flowing to people on the brink of starvation."
7,WORLDPOST,Will the Delhi Bonhomie Lead to a New Era in Pakistan-India Relations?,"Frank Islam and Ed Crego, Contributors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/will-the-delhi-bonhomie-l_b_5602269.html,It has yet to be determined whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's decision to invite Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to his swearing-in ceremony will translate into substantive improvement in Pakistan-India relations. This will be dictated primarily by two factors: the mutual interests and actions of both actors and the state of security within Pakistan.,2014-07-22,"India's new Prime Minister Narendra Modi (R) shakes hands with Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif during a meeting in New Delhi on May 27, 2014. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif for landmark talks in New Delhi May 27 in a bid to ease tensions between the nuclear-armed neighbours. AFP PHOTO/RAVEENDRAN (Photo credit should read RAVEENDRAN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13a8f240000330076e297.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been in office for two months now, and he has already taken several actions to change India's social and economic direction. The most surprising move the newly elected Indian leader has made to date, however, was his decision to invite Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to his swearing-in ceremony. It caught nearly all observers off-guard.It has yet to be determined whether this symbolic gesture will translate into substantive improvement in Pakistan-India relations. This will be dictated primarily by two factors: the mutual interests and actions of both actors and the state of security within Pakistan.Prior to extending the invitation to Prime Minister Sharif, Prime Minister Modi had never shown much interest in reaching out to Pakistan. During his tenure as the chief minister of Gujarat, which shares a border with the province of Sindh, Modi had never given the impression of being a peacemaker when it came to Pakistan. Indeed, during the campaign, he and other BJP leaders consistently attacked the Indian government led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh for not being tough enough on Pakistan.That is why Modi should be lauded for transcending parochial politics by inviting Sharif, along with leaders of other neighboring countries, to his inauguration. It has once again raised hopes about normalization of ties between Islamabad and New Delhi.Now the challenge for both leaders is to use the positive energy generated in New Delhi last month to take relations to the next level.Twice in the past decade and a half, Indian and Pakistani leaders had made similar high-profile bilateral visits. In 1999, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee famously crossed the Wagha Border for a historic summit in Lahore. They signed a treaty, the Lahore Declaration, whose cornerstone was ""reducing the risk of accidental or unauthorized use of nuclear weapons."" It came just months after both nations conducted nuclear tests.Six years later, during President Pervez Musharraf's highly televised visit to India, the two nations agreed again on a series of measures, declaring that the peace process was ""irreversible.""But on both occasions the bonhomie did not last long, and the relations reverted to the default position within a short period of time. In fact, less than three months after Vajpayee visited Lahore, the two nations went to war over the Kargil heights.It is not necessary here to comment on why those visits and agreements failed to serve as the basis for transforming the ties between Pakistan and India. Those reasons are well documented, and each side has a litany of grievances against the other. That was the past.The relevant question relevant now is: What should the two sides do to ensure that hopes are not dashed going forward?The best weapon against the burdens of the past is the promises of the future. And that future looks bright for both countries at the moment. India is the third-largest economy in the world in purchasing-power parity. Its growth is fueled by an ever-growing middle class, which is projected by McKinsey Global Institute to grow to a whopping 583 million by 2025. Pakistan is one of the ""Next 11"" (""N-11"") countries identified by Goldman Sachs as major, emerging, 21st-century economic powers, along with the BRICS nations: Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. Its middle class is already bigger in size than the populations of all but two European nations, Russia and Germany.With hundreds of millions of young people poised to be added to the workforce in the coming decade, both nations will benefit immensely by boosting their economic relations. Therefore, Sharif and Modi should put enhancing economic relations at the front and center of the ties.A first step in that direction would be to increase bilateral trade, which, until now, has been a casualty of political differencesCurrently, the trade between the two countries is only $2.6 billion, according to India's Ministry of Commerce. In March alone, India exported to the United States nearly double the amount of goods -- in dollar terms -- that it exported to Pakistan in the whole of last year. The volume of India's imports from America for the same month was 315-percent more than its imports from Pakistan in the last fiscal year. Last year, there were 36 other countries that bought more Indian goods than Pakistan, and 66 nations that sold more commodities to India than Pakistan did. It is not just the economic powerhouses in the west and oil-rich Middle Eastern nations that benefited more from the growing Indian market; smaller countries such as Angola, Tanzania, Gabon and Ecuador exported more goods to India than Pakistan did.Because it is so small at present, Pakistan-India bilateral trade should only go one way: up and up.A report released recently by the Atlantic Council says bilateral trade between the two nations ""has the potential of growing to $40 billion in just a few years."" Shuja Nawaz, director of the Council's South Asia Center made an even bolder prediction. If India and Pakistan ""were to go back to the level of trade that they had at the time of independence in 1947, you could have between $40 and $100 billion worth of trade between the two countries,"" he said, speaking to NPR last week. ""And more important, if they open their borders to each other, you would have tourism trade. You would have religious tourism from both sides and you would have trade with Central Asia through Afghanistan.""In Gujarat, Modi was defined by two things: his hard-line politics and his laser-sharp focus on the economy. During Modi's tenure as the chief minister, Gujarat was more business-friendly than any other Indian state. As a result, it was able to attract foreign investments worth billions of dollars.The Pakistani prime minister's presence at Modi's swearing-in ceremony, and the fact that bilateral talks were held with Pakistan on his first day in office, not to mention a number of pro-growth measures he took in the first few days in office, signal that Modi will follow the same pragmatic and business-friendly policies in Delhi as well. Thus, the future for improved relations looks quite promising. The one major obstacle could be the Taliban threat to Pakistan and to India. The bombing of the Karachi airport on June 8 is an indication that a tenous détente between the Pakistani government and the Taliban is coming apart. In response, Pakistani fighter jets bombed militant insurgent hideouts in the country's troubled northwest region, which has been a haven for Taliban, al-Qaida and Uzbek terrorists, and the Pakistani army launched an offensive in mid-June to rid the tribal region of North Waziristan of the Taliban. The Pakistani military states that the offensive has killed hundreds of militants in the region, and that after a month on the offensive, it is making good progress against the militants. But it also recently reported that some senior militant leaders fled the area before the offensive was launched.The government may be able to contain the conflict within its own borders and to ensure order. This would stabilize the situation and allow the Pakistan-Indian relationship to continue to evolve and move forward. If, on the other hand, an incident were to occur in India such as the attacks on Mumbai in 2008 by Pakistani militants, all bets would be off.No one can predict the future or control the minds or movements of radicals and extremists. What can be said with certainty is that if both leaders continue on the path they trod and the journey they started on May 22, we may be witnessing a new era in Pakistan-India relations. Rhetoric will be translated into reality, and both nations and their citizens will be the beneficiaries.To get regular updates on what Frank and Ed are writing and reading, subscribe to their newsletter by clicking here."

They heard their speakers demand relief for the former soldiers and then quietly dispersed. (AP Photo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d0232000000f0201d0e9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Few lines between points A and B seem to be as short and direct in American politics as that between veterans and patriotism. Veterans and patriotism are almost interchangeable, but peeling away the veneer reveals the conflicted relationship America has with its veterans. In no other equation do we have as stark and simple a lens through which to see the difference between who we say we are and who we actually are. Exhibit A: This month, on July 28, you will hear no parades, no testimonies read, and no moments of silence will be observed for the 82nd anniversary of the Bonus Marchers of 1932. The Bonus Marchers were 17,000 World War I veterans who gathered in Washington D.C. and demanded immediate payment of service certificates given to them by the government in 1924. These certificates, tardy the day they were conceived, were the result of a program that dictated that they could not be cashed in until 1945, so thanks for the service, now let us give you a hand with your rent and food 20 years from now. And we now know the country would have much different budget concerns in 1945 that would compete with the aging obligation to mop up our human debt from the First World War. It is an interesting bit of trivia that the officer in charge of vacating the Bonus Marchers on July 28th from Anacostia Flats and empty government buildings was Douglas MacArthur. Against the advice of his young aide Dwight Eisenhower, MacArthur personally led from a mount a straight four column phalanx with bayonets fixed against American veterans exercising the very rights we all say they protect. The layers of bitter irony are many; five Renault tanks supported the phalanx with their sights aimed at the marchers, some of whom had driven or commandeered that very model of tank while in uniform, and gas canisters were shot at the Bonus Marchers, which for many was not the first time they choked in a chemical fog. Here is what really grabs me; MacArthur, that same afternoon, told the press he believed Red agitation caused the marchers to gather and protest, thus justifying their being silenced and their shanty town burned.The key theme here is that with relatively simple changes in the way the veterans were categorized to the public they went from hero to villain with the verbal stroke of a pen, and the patriotism and parades that welcomed these guys home fell silent as they were marginalized, de-legitimized and finally brutalized almost as if they had been in the opposing trenches 15 years earlier.This idea of marginalizing and stigmatizing veterans as some fringe element, even assign to them a whiff of anti-Americanism, would make many return appearances in Washington and throughout American society, and somehow America provides a soft-landing for it almost every time. The real question is why the stigmatization of veterans is tolerated so casually, and what the connection is between that lack of vigilance and the endlessly repeated claim that this country owes a massive debt to each and every veteran, etc. Somewhere within that is a glimpse at the underbelly of a country that is fervently pro-veteran in word but not necessarily in deed.It says something much darker about us when it comes to Vietnam, since clearly this country, for all its purported love of veterans and honoring of service, was more than happy to stand-by in 2000, 2002, and 2004 while decorated veterans of both parties were tarred and feathered. Exhibit B: 2000; Republican U.S. Senator John McCain was a victim of whisper campaigns in the South Carolina GOP Presidential Primary that he caved while a captive, that his adopted daughter was actually conceived out of wedlock, and other GOP candidates in those primaries trumpeted the support of leaders of angry splinter veterans organizations that openly charged McCain with lying about POW-MIAs. The implied whiff of weakness and/or anti-Americanism was a common strand in all of those slander campaigns, and it was not only tolerated by the American people but rewarded.Exhibit C: 2002; incumbent Democratic Senator Max Cleland was pilloried in a Georgia Senate race for being soft on Bin Laden for some cherry-picked procedural votes in the U.S. Senate, resulting in a triple-amputee's patriotism being questioned and maligned. This country barely raised an eyebrow.Exhibit D: 2004; John Kerry, fragged with the campaign that has now entered our political lexicon, which retroactively questioned his military service in the late '60s due to resentment for his public anti-war leadership of the early '70s. The Swift Boat veterans questioned the validity of his medals, but criticism of military procedures is not a' la carte; you can't impugn someone's medals without implicitly criticizing the military chain of command that bestowed them. Here we can crystallize a perfect example of my overall point; the Swift Boat veterans' criticism of the military's decoration decisions are socially protected and wear the cultural veil of patriotism, and John Kerry questioned the morality of sending 19-year-olds into Free Fire Zones and was successfully ostracized. Both wore the uniform, but only one party was welcomed within the patriotic glow.Exhibit E: Illinois congressional challenger Tammy Duckworth, a Black Hawk pilot who lost both legs in Iraq, had her service repeatedly belittled by incumbent Joe Walsh in 2012 and the slander received a shrug from the American people and vanished after a 24-hour lap around the cable news track.In this brief essay I have not even gotten into VA funding, the back log of appeals and cases, the mountain of neglected paperwork that should embarrass each of us, or the hideous statistic that more American soldiers have committed suicide since we sent troops to Afghanistan than have died there, because I want to focus on the anniversary of the Bonus Marchers and draw modern parallels. Any principled stand would dictate that each veteran described above should fall within the realm of social respect and deference, just as the Bonus Marchers should have been left to peacefully exercise their First Amendment rights. But when it comes to veterans this country can very quickly set aside its self-congratulating respect for those who serve, draining our bumper stickers and applause-generating talking points of any real meaning. Push comes to shove we are still left with the weakest and most base of human dynamics; some are on the inside and others outside, often due to nothing other than the herd momentum of consensus or factors like socioeconomics, race, or geography, and, depending on where you fall in all that and what you stand for, having worn the uniform can very quickly mean very little. The problem with that is some of those on the outside at one point were willing to die for you and me, and we return the favor with insincere chest-thumping about our obligation to veterans while proving it is within our national character to stand by while certain veterans are shunned, marginalized and treated as un-American, as with the 17,000 World War 1 veterans forcibly removed from Washington D.C. 82 years ago this month."
