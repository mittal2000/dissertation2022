2,ARTS,The Composers Speak: Broadway Composers Participate in a Concert of Their Choral Work,"Shoshana Greenberg, ContributorWriter",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-composers-speak-broadway-composers-participate-in-a-concert-of-their-choral-work_b_7008612.html,"These writers have made their names in musical theater, but they value the opportunity to compose and be recognized for their choral music.",2015-04-06,2015-04-06-1428321833-7824448-thelineup31.13.15.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-06-1428321833-7824448-thelineup31.13.15-thumb.jpg,"When Broadway composers aren't writing musicals, they're still composing. They write music for plays, film scores, and symphonies. They also write choral music, and this Wednesday the chorus I sing with, Essential Voices USA, will showcase the choral work of legendary Broadway composers and lyricists such as Sheldon Harnick (Fiddler on the Roof), Stephen Schwartz (Wicked), and Maury Yeston (Nine) in their concert, ""Beyond Broadway: Composers Go Choral."" Essential Voices USA director Judith Clurman conceived the evening as part of her The Composer Speaks series, which brings the composers on stage as their pieces are being performed. ""The Composer Speaks enables us to perform and discuss a piece,"" Clurman said. ""We might have a chance to perform an entire piece twice. We can even discuss one measure."" Television and radio host Midge Woolsey will moderate the evening at the DiMenna Center for Classical Music in New York City.The concert came together through Clurman's relationships with the composers involved, some going back many years. Harnick, Schwartz, Yeston, Richard Maltby and David Shire (Closer than Ever), Andrew Lippa (The Addams Family), Josh Schmidt (The Adding Machine), Stephen Flaherty (Ragtime), Broadway orchestrators Larry Hochman and Jonathan Tunick, Georgia Stitt, and the late Marvin Hamlisch (A Chorus Line) contributed work for the concert. Nearly all will be in attendance.  Judith Clurman and the artists involved in the concertThese writers have made their names in musical theater, but they value the opportunity to compose and be recognized for their choral music. ""In choral music you can stop and smell the words for a while and you can repeat phrases, tumble over a sentence, and musically spin out something that interests you,"" Lippa said in a phone interview. ""Choral music relieves me of the burden of constant narrative.""Lippa's choral piece, ""I Believe in Democracy,"" comes from ""Sing Out Mr. President,"" a song cycle using the words of presidential speeches which Clurman commissioned from various composers. Two other pieces in the program come from that cycle: ""Opinion is Power"" by Hochman and ""With Hope and Virtue"" by Stitt. Stitt also enjoys the freedom of choral writing. ""In pure choral music I enjoy playing with sonic ideas, lingering on vowels, repeating words just because they sound good,"" she said. ""I've never been able to pull that off in theater music because the audience is waiting for something else to happen.""Clurman likes to see this different, sometimes more serious side of the composers. ""It has been fun for me to tap into the classical side of a Marvin Hamlisch or Josh Schmidt or Andrew Lippa,"" she said. ""I believe each composer can write in varied styles. Most people do not ask them to write for a group of people.""The concert will be a rare chance to hear Hamlisch's choral work. His piece, ""Music,"" is taken from the writings of Emerson, one of his favorite authors. ""He connected to a world of self-reflection,"" his widow Terre Blair said. ""He heard music in it, the musicality of transcending oneself to something beyond.""The composers attending are game for this workshop and concert format. ""It's always fun to hear something that you have only heard in your head as you were writing it,"" Shire said in a phone interview. ""There's nothing like real voices.""Yeston looks forward to the conversation accompanying the performance. ""I love to hear what people's reactions are,"" he said by phone. ""To me, the thrill of having someone perform something of mine is that they always find something new in it that I did not know was there."" Yeston's piece, ""And He's Allowed Me"" from American Cantata, is taken from the words of Martin Luther King, Jr.'s famous last speech and was originally performed on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial with 2,000 singers.The audience will discover more about the composers and lyricists' processes, which are not always apparent when listening to music. ""A song is intended to sound like it didn't come with any work at all,"" Maltby, a lyricist, said during a phone call. ""The melody was always there, the words just followed. Of course there is enormous effort and a lot of other ideas were tried and rejected on the way to this idea.""Clurman added, ""The most amazing thing for me is that The Composer Speaks format makes people aware that the composers and/or lyricists sitting in the room with them have created this music."" Judith ClurmanThe program includes world premieres (Hamlisch's ""Music""), New York premieres (Hochman's ""Meditation"" and Schmidt's ""Thirteen Ways of Looking at a Blackbird""), as well as work previously performed by and arranged specifically for the chorus. Stephen Flaherty arranged his piece ""Make Them Hear You,"" a solo song in his musical Ragtime, for male voices. ""Judith [Clurman] wanted to focus on a simple and direct arrangement for male choir that featured unison singing,"" Flaherty said in an email. ""The statement of the song is strong and direct and we wanted the arrangement to reflect that.""Maltby and Shire originally wrote ""Travel,"" a song from their 1976 revue Starting Here, Starting Now that is also a new arrangement for the chorus, for a show based on the novel The River about an English family in India. The show was never produced, but the song survived. ""I have to write for a character, whether that character is in the story or not, it has to be a character,"" Maltby explained. 'Travel' is a song sung by a father to entertain the children but it is also the theme of the entire show, which is about movement and what constitutes home.""While some composers like to write for a character, others enjoy the freedom of writing from themselves. ""When a song involves personal feelings it's easier to write,"" Harnick, a lyricist, said. ""When you have to write a song for a character who's remote for your personality and you have to invent, that's hard."" Harnick wrote the lyrics for ""Reason to be Thankful"" with Hochman.The composers are thankful to have the opportunity to contribute to the choral music cannon and work with Clurman and Essential Voices USA. ""[Clurman] is one of the premier virtuosi of choral music in our time,"" Yeston said. ""It's not only her excellence and her discipline and her superb musicality, it's also the encyclopedic breadth of her knowledge and understanding of so many different kinds of choral music.""""There are less of these kinds of concerts happening,"" Hochman added. ""There are church choirs. We have our big orchestras and our opera and the ballet. But I don't see much of the regular choral concerts.

4,ENTERTAINMENT,Is 'Bitch Better Have My Money' a Song About Reparations?,"Barbara Sostaita , ContributorMasters Candidate in Religion, Yale University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/is-bitch-better-have-my-money-a-song-about-reparations_b_7000736.html,"In her own way, Rihanna is bringing these violent realities to light. In ""Bitch Better Have My Money,"" she is calling for an acknowledgement of past injustices and a recognition that who we are is forever shaped and altered by who we were.",2015-04-05,"LOS ANGELES, CA - MARCH 29: Singer Rihanna performs onstage during the 2015 iHeartRadio Music Awards which broadcasted live on NBC from The Shrine Auditorium on March 29, 2015 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Mazur/Getty Images for iHeartMedia)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4afe72200004301dc2e6c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This week, Bad Gal Ri Ri returned with the second single from her upcoming album, Bitch Better Have My Money. Vulture called the song ""a slice of ratchet heaven,"" and Billboard exalted Rihanna as a ""trap queen"" who has taken claim to her throne with this single. While I agree with both of these assertions, I also think this song is a powerful and politically charged anthem calling for reparations owed by white America for the wrongs and the legacy of slavery.After getting this text message from a close friend and hip hop scholar:I haven't been able to listen to the track without considering the powerful implications it has for this particular moment in popular culture. We are living in a time where it is impossible to dismiss the legacies of colonialism, slavery and violence, which shape lives and worlds in the present. As rapper Azealia Banks said in a recent Playboy interview, ""The generational effects of Jim Crow and poverty linger on."" When asked why she always brings up the topic of race in interviews and Twitter, Banks replied: ""Because y'all motherf---ers still owe me reparations! That's why it's all about race... As long as I have my money, I'm getting the f--- out of here, and I'm gonna leave y'all to your own devices."" Rihanna and Azealia Banks seem to be on the same page with this one. Rihanna is haughty and unapologetic in this song, evocative of Beyonce's no-holds-barred, ""bow down bitches,"" persona in ""***Flawless."" Shouting out, ""Where y'all at? Where y'all at? Where y'all at?"" she demands accountability from white America for the ""two hundred fifty years of slavery. Ninety years of Jim Crow. Sixty years of separate but equal, and 35 years of racist housing policy,"" that Ta-Nehisi Coates elaborates on in a powerful treatise on the importance for reparations. Her demands are clear: ""Pay me what you owe me, don't act like you forgot."" White America has a tendency of sweeping aside less-than-idyllic historical narratives and glossing over the conquest of the continent, the dispossession of native peoples and the enslavement of Africans whose labor built the economy of this country. In her own way, Rihanna is bringing these violent realities to light. In ""Bitch Better Have My Money,"" she is calling for an acknowledgement of past injustices and a recognition that who we are is forever shaped and altered by who we were. She asserts her dominance by reminding her listeners she ""calls the shots, shots, shots like bra, bra, bra."" Here, bra, bra, bra clearly represents gunshot sounds. Rap Genius notes that Rih is shooting warning shots in the air, ""emphasizing that she's in control and not to be f---ed with."" In a country where there is a prevailing fear of Black resistance, Rihanna is claiming her right to defend herself and her hard-earned money and is encouraging others to do the same. In The Case For Reparations, Ta-Nehisi Coates writes: What I'm talking about is more than recompense for past injustices--more than a handout, a payoff, hush money, or a reluctant bribe. What I'm talking about is a national reckoning that would lead to spiritual renewal... Reparations would mean a revolution of the American consciousness, a reconciling of our self-image as the great democratizer with the facts of our history. Rihanna's new track is a step towards the ""national reckoning"" and change in consciousness that Coates is calling for. By tapping into Black expressive culture and artistic modes of resistance, Rihanna is joining a centuries long tradition of musicians who use their voice to call for equality and justice. ""Bitch Better Have My Money"" speaks directly to a cultural imaginary where ideals like ""post-racial America"" and ""colorblindness"" are celebrated and welcomed. Yet by demanding accountability for 400 years of racism and the afterlife of slavery, Rihanna is calling white America's bluff. She rejects any notion that we as a society have somehow ""evolved"" beyond racism and reminds us that histories stay alive, even when they are not consciously remembered. Who y'all think y'all frontin' on?"

But that seems about to change.  ""We call ourselves the ultimate driving machine,"" said Matt Russell of BMW North America. ""Preserving that driving experience is everything to us. We sell to those who really love driving, and we needed a way to build a sports car that was also energy efficient.  ""We needed a sports car that can go from 0-60 miles per hour in 3.6 seconds, top out at 155 miles an hour and has a fuel efficiency rating of 72 miles per gallon. And that's the BMW i8.""  The i8, unveiled at the New York International Auto Show, is a stealth fighter of a car built to flow through the air rather than punch through it. There are grooves in the body designed to channel onrushing air through a narrow opening in the rear, not unlike the combustion chamber of the average jet. The result, at high speed, is you ride on a cushion of air and hear nothing from the world outside.Not to be outdone, Porsche has taken its Cayenne, the 150-miles per hour SUV, and retooled a plug-in hybrid version as a family-friendly companion to its hybrid Panamera sports car.  ""It's our feeling that electric motors are the wave of the future,"" said Porsche spokesman Thomas Hagg. ""But the technology isn't quite there yet and the infrastructure and market aren't ready for completely electric vehicles. But we feel it is certainly coming, so we have begun moving in that direction with the plug-in hybrid. The Panamera proved that we can have an electric hybrid that meets the quality demands of Porsche in terms of performance and handling.   ""But to really move our brand into the electric future we needed to develop a plug-in hybrid for the Cayenne, which is our best-selling model.""The combined Porsche power plant was on display at the New York exhibit, which lasts until April 12, but is definitely not just for show. The Cayenne has a 95 horsepower electric motor combined with a 333 horsepower, three-liter V6 engine. One can drive the Cayenne about 20 miles on purely electric power -- which is ample for many commutes -- and the combined power plant gets about 50 miles per gallon.  While BMW and Porsche may have had the plug-in hybrid showstoppers, they were certainly not alone among auto makers who see an increasingly electric future. Ford's popular Fusion has a plug-in electric model and Mitsubishi, which introduced a newly designed Outlander SUV, is also bringing out a part-electric hybrid version.The company tentatively entered the all-electric market with its iMiEV, an awkwardly named vehicle that most resembled an ostrich egg on wheels. It was comfortable and efficient. But cars are a form of sculpture defined by how they make a person stop, look, and feel when standing close and then sitting inside. For many families, it is the largest form of kinetic art they will buy. As art works, the iMiEV or BMW's i3 would never draw a crowd.  Hence the change. ""The Outlander plug-in hybrid,"" said Mitsubishi Executive Vice President Don Swearingen, ""is a bigger vehicle and clearly one that will appeal to more consumers than the fully electric ones with their more limited range.   ""We actually developed it a few years ago and started selling it in Japan and then in Europe. The demand was so high that the plant that makes our batteries is at full capacity. We still are offering all electric cars, but our growth opportunity is in the plug-in space. I drive a fully electric car, but I live 40 miles from work. As long as I can charge each night and again at the office it works fine. But if I want to make a longer trip, a decision has to be made as to what car to use.  ""With the plug-in hybrid, all those considerations go away. We felt it important to offer a plug-in, five-passenger vehicle, which has 4-wheel drive capabilities and is a great opportunity for families. Since we were redesigning the Outlander, it made sense to design a version for the electric motor and batteries.""While the regular Outlander is a seven passenger SUV, the hybrid version will seat five people, and the added space will be taken up by the battery pack. The Outlander will have two 60-horsepower electric motors -- one assigned to each axle -- as well as a 121-horsepower, four-cylinder gasoline engine. The combination delivers about 44 miles per gallon.  Electric cars dominated American roadways for the first 20 years of the 20th Century, but quickly lost out to gasoline-powered vehicles which could go a lot further without worrying about a dead battery. --Continue reading at Shifting Gears."

""The Outlander plug-in hybrid,"" said Mitsubishi Executive Vice President Don Swearingen, ""is a bigger vehicle and clearly one that will appeal to more consumers than the fully electric ones with their more limited range.   ""We actually developed it a few years ago and started selling it in Japan and then in Europe. The demand was so high that the plant that makes our batteries is at full capacity. We still are offering all electric cars, but our growth opportunity is in the plug-in space. I drive a fully electric car, but I live 40 miles from work. As long as I can charge each night and again at the office it works fine. But if I want to make a longer trip, a decision has to be made as to what car to use.  ""With the plug-in hybrid, all those considerations go away. We felt it important to offer a plug-in, five-passenger vehicle, which has 4-wheel drive capabilities and is a great opportunity for families. Since we were redesigning the Outlander, it made sense to design a version for the electric motor and batteries.""While the regular Outlander is a seven passenger SUV, the hybrid version will seat five people, and the added space will be taken up by the battery pack. The Outlander will have two 60-horsepower electric motors -- one assigned to each axle -- as well as a 121-horsepower, four-cylinder gasoline engine. The combination delivers about 44 miles per gallon.  Electric cars dominated American roadways for the first 20 years of the 20th Century, but quickly lost out to gasoline-powered vehicles which could go a lot further without worrying about a dead battery. --Continue reading at Shifting Gears."

The final agreement, expected by the end of June, would require additional ""technical details"" to be resolved. Not surprisingly, the announcement triggered a media frenzy. Supporters and critics of the Obama administration quickly lined up to hail ""the historic agreement"" as the ""only alternative to war"" or condemn it as ""inadequate"" and ""legitimating Iran's quest for nuclear weapons."" Regardless of one's assessment of the ""framework"" that was announced in Lausanne, it's clear that the agreement, if successfully implemented, will redefine the political dynamic of the Middle East.Iran's Nuclear ProgramThe key terms of the agreement will require Iran to limit its activity to enrich uranium and reduce its existing stockpile. In addition, the heavy water ""research reactor"" at Arak will be redesigned so that it will not produce plutonium as a byproduct of its operations. Enrichment activity will be limited to the facility at Natanz and it, along with all other non-military installations involved in nuclear research or development, will be subject to inspection by the International Atomic Energy Agency. The number of gas centrifuges used to enrich uranium will be reduced from 19,000 to 6,104 for 10 years. Of these, 5,060 will be the less efficient, first generation, centrifuges. Iranian Nuclear SitesUranium 235, the isotope that is employed by a nuclear reactor and the fissionable material around which atomic bombs are built, makes up approximately 0.7 percent of the uranium oxide produced from refining uranium ore. The other 99.3 percent consists of Uranium 238. To isolate U-235, uranium oxide is treated with fluoride and converted to the gas uranium hexafluoride. It is then processed at low temperature through a series of gas centrifuges to increase its concentration. The typical nuclear reactor requires U-235 concentrated to between three percent and five percent. Weapons grade U-235 must be concentrated to a level of 90 percent. In addition, Iran's existing supply of enriched uranium will be reduced by 97 percent, from 10,000 kg to 300 kg. That stockpile has been enriched to varying levels of up to 20 percent, although, it is believed, only about 200 kg has been enriched to that level. The remaining stockpile, if it were further enriched, assuming it was already at the 20 percent level, would be sufficient to produce enough fissile material for two or three atomic bombs. The composition of the permitted stockpile of 300 kg is another one of the ""technical"" issues to be resolved. Iran has agreed that for the next 15 years it will not enrich its stockpile of uranium higher than 3.67 percent, the level it needs to fuel its nuclear power reactor. There are two ways for Iran to obtain enough fissile material to construct bombs. One way is to enrich uranium 235 to a level of 90 percent. The other is to divert plutonium produced as a byproduct of the operation of the heavy water ""research reactor"" in Arak. The agreement will prevent Iran for utilizing either source. In addition, Iran has agreed that no spent nuclear fuel will be reprocessed in Iran, and all spent fuel rods will be exported to a third party, most likely Russia, for reprocessing. The Fodrow nuclear facility, currently the second facility where enrichment is taking place, will be converted to a civilian research facility for nuclear physics and technology.The agreement leaves a lot of questions unanswered. These are the ""technical"" issues that are going to be the subject of further deliberations and which are slated to be concluded by the end of June. For example, what will Iran do with the balance of its gas centrifuges? Will it decommission them or rotate them into use while still keeping below the agreed upon level of 6,104 units? The question is an important one.Gas centrifuges are extremely sensitive pieces of equipment. It's unlikely they can be mothballed for 10 or more years and then simply reactivated in the future. This equipment is extremely hard to procure and subject to extensive export controls. It is not easily replaceable. How Iran treats this equipment has an important bearing on its ability to reactivate or enlarge the program at a later date. Moreover, Iran has not agreed to end its research on developing nuclear weapons and military research facilities are specifically excluded from inspection by the IAEA. In addition, the agreement has no bearing on Iran's missile arsenal or its continued development of longer range ballistic missiles, their guidance systems or their accompanying warheads.Iran's Nuclear Program: A Credible Threat?To be a full member of the ""Nuclear Club"" you need four key items. First of all, you need an atomic device. Secondly you need a credible ability to deliver that device to its intended target. In this day and age that means a missile. In theory one could load up an atomic bomb on a truck and just drive it to its destination and then detonate it. Suspense thrillers are full of all kinds of innovative ways of delivering an atomic bomb. In Tom Clancy's The Sum of all Fears, an atomic bomb was hidden in a vending machine and was detonated at a stadium while hosting a Super Bowl. In real life, however, a missile is the best way to deliver an atomic device.In turn missiles require two more critical items: a guidance system and a warhead miniaturized to a size where it can fit on a missile. Despite claims, most notably from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that Iran is only a ""year or two"" away from developing a deliverable atomic device (a claim that he has made for the last 10 years) the reality is that Iran still has a long way to go before it can have a credible nuclear threat. It's conceivable that Iran could, in the space of a year or two, enrich enough uranium 235 to the 90 percent level required in an atomic bomb. Depending on the design and yield of that device, that would require between 8 and 16 kg of fissile material. This would create a bomb with a yield of between 20 and 30 kilotons, roughly comparable to the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Even that goal, however, is no trivial task and would still require Iran to design and test a bomb and perfect a delivery mechanism.Iran has developed a medium range ballistic missile, the Shahab-3, with a, presumed, maximum range of around 1,200 miles. This would be sufficient to target a broad circumference around Iran that would encompass Cairo, Istanbul and the entire Arabian Peninsula, and would extend eastward all the way to New Delhi. The Shahab, which means meteor in Farsi, was based on the North Korean Nodong-1, which in turn was based on the Soviet SS-1 or ""Scud"" missile.  Range of Shahab-3 Ballistic MissileThe Shahab has a number of variants and has been steadily improved. It has a sophisticated rocket nozzle control system that allows it to change its trajectory in order to prevent early warning radar from providing a trajectory prediction to guide interceptor missiles. The missile's CEP (circular error probability) is between 100 and 200 feet. That means it would be expected to hit within a 200 foot radius of the intended target 95 percent of the time. For pinpoint targeting of military objectives with conventional munitions, that's not very accurate. For an atomic weapon of mass destruction launched at a city, it is accurate enough. It is unclear how effective the guidance system of the Shahab-3 is at long distances, however, or how it would operate in a battlefield situation.A variant of the Shahab-3 called the Ghadr-110 has a comparable range but requires a set up time of only 30 minutes. Significantly, on March 8, Iran unveiled a new cruise missile, the Soumar, with a range of between 1,200 and 1,800 miles. The Soumar is capable of carrying a 400 to 500 pound nuclear warhead. It is based on the Soviet era HK-55 (AS-25) missile. Western intelligence agencies believed that the Soumar was reverse engineered from a dozen HK-55 that Iran obtained illegally from Ukraine in 2001.The final element of a credible nuclear threat is the ability to miniaturize an atomic device so that it can be delivered by a ballistic missile. The original Hiroshima bomb, ""Little Boy"" weighted approximately five tons. A warhead of comparable explosive force would have to weigh less than 500 pounds to be able to fit on a ballistic missile. Despite occasional news reports that Iran has already learned how to miniaturize a nuclear warhead, as of April 2015, there is no evidence that Iran has mastered the technology required to have a nuclear armed ballistic missile. In short, it is highly unlikely that Iran is on the verge of developing an atomic weapon. It is clear that Iran was assembling the components and capabilities that would have allowed it to develop such weapons at a later date. The current agreement will not prevent Iran from developing an atomic device in the future, nor will it constrain its ability to develop ballistic missile technology, improved guidance systems or its ability to miniaturize an atomic device into a useable warhead. The agreement, however, will significantly slow down Iran's ability to develop an atomic device and, in all likelihood, delay that eventuality for another 10 to 15 years.  Shahab-3 Ballistic Missile With Mobile launcherIn addition, although the agreement cannot prevent Iran from cheating on the accord, a broad IAEA inspection regime will make it far more likely that any such cheating will quickly be identified. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the agreement will do nothing to constrain Tehran's strategy of political Shiism and its destabilizing influence on the rest of the Middle East. Indeed, by eliminating sanctions and allowing the free flow of Iranian oil exports again, the agreement will actually enhance Iran's ability to promote its Shia political agenda.Contrary to the argument that the alternative to this agreement was to go to war with Iran, given the fact that no Iranian bomb was imminent, there was in fact another alternative: Do nothing and simply continue with the present sanctions strategy. By opting to effectively seek a rapprochement with Iran in the context of an agreement over Iran's nuclear program, Washington has effectively reshuffled the political deck in the Middle East. In the process it has accepted some short term risks in return for potentially gaining a much stronger position in the future.The U.S., Iran and the New Political Dynamic in the Middle EastCritics of the Obama administration's foreign policy, this author included, have argued that part of the motivation for seeking a rapprochement with Iran was a desperate desire to put a mark in the White House's ""win column"" and to burnish an otherwise lackluster foreign policy record. There is undoubtedly some truth in this, but let's leave this aside for now and give the Obama administration the benefit of the doubt. By seeking a rapprochement with Tehran, Washington has set the stage for the emergence of a balance of power system in the Middle East that will see Iran and its allies, Saudi Arabia and its allies, and Turkey compete for power and influence in the region. The United States will, in theory, now be ideally positioned to lend its support to whichever party it needs to maintain a stable balance of power in the area. Instead of being reflexively pro-Arab or anti-Iranian, Washington now has the ability to follow a more nuanced foreign policy, lending its support to wherever and whomever best serves its long term interests. In this context there is no contradiction in siding with Iran to resist Islamic State militants in Iraq while supporting the Saudi intervention against the Iranian backed Houthi militants in Yemen. In this paradigm the U.S. would be equally flexible in supporting Israel against Hezbollah, another Iranian proxy, while simultaneously supporting, or at the very least remaining neutral, the continuation of the Hezbollah and Iranian supported Assad regime in Syria. Almost two centuries ago, the British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston observed that ""Great Britain has no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, only permanent interests."" In the Gulf, the permanent interests of the United States are twofold: to ensure the free flow of oil to the rest of the world and to prevent any one party to control a significant percentage of the regions oil reserves. A rapprochement with Tehran affords Washington the strategic flexibility of siding with whichever party best allows it to protect those interests.This is a far more subtle, more nuanced foreign policy than the Obama administration has been able to execute in the past. Time will tell just how effective the White House will be in carrying it out and more significantly, the extent to which its Republican opponents in Congress will allow it the strategic flexibility to actually try to implement it. It is also a strategy that comes with considerable risk. In the short term, the end of the sanctions regime will empower Iran and will enhance its ability to carry out its aggressive policy of militant political Shiism. The immediate impact will be less stability and more chaos in the Middle East in general and the Gulf in particular. Moreover, a strategy of being the pivot around which a balance of power system revolves presupposes that there is no other pivot available to challenge ""the balancer."" In the balance of power system of nineteenth century Europe that pivot was Great Britain, and that system worked relatively well until the rise of Germany upended it. The United States is the dominant power in the Middle East and for now can act the role of the king maker, but that is a role that Russia and China are likely to challenge. A system in which the U.S. has less control is one that is also more likely to push it to the sidelines. In addition, while friendship with the United States is highly desirable for any Middle Eastern nation, the risks associated with a more opportunistic American foreign policy will also mean that those nations will ""hedge their bets."" One immediate effect will be a further, significant arms buildup in the region. Moreover, the more uncertain Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies are about American guarantees of their security the more likely are they to reach out to countries like Pakistan or Egypt to insure those security needs.Finally, the willingness to act independently of Washington can also function to add more uncertainty in Middle East politics. Saudi Arabia's intervention in Yemen, a case in point, has given rise to what some have called ""The Salman Doctrine,"" a stated policy for preemptive, independent military intervention by Riyadh and its allies whenever a Sunni government in the Gulf of the Arabian Peninsula is threatened by Shiite unrest. While such actions may be consistent with American interests in the region and spare Washington from having to commit American military forces, they also create a more complex environment for Washington to manage. In the long run, the growing Sunni-Shia divide, the continuing rise of Iran and the ongoing chaos resulting from the combination of failed states and extremist Sunni and Shia militant groups will function to make the Middle East even more unstable in the future then it has been in the past. An opportunistic American foreign policy that relies on regional powers to maintain a balance in the region may not, ultimately, make the region any less stable, but at the very least it will reduce the cost to the United States of that instability. What is clear is that we have only begun to feel the effects of Washington's détente with Tehran."

The United States will, in theory, now be ideally positioned to lend its support to whichever party it needs to maintain a stable balance of power in the area. Instead of being reflexively pro-Arab or anti-Iranian, Washington now has the ability to follow a more nuanced foreign policy, lending its support to wherever and whomever best serves its long term interests. In this context there is no contradiction in siding with Iran to resist Islamic State militants in Iraq while supporting the Saudi intervention against the Iranian backed Houthi militants in Yemen. In this paradigm the U.S. would be equally flexible in supporting Israel against Hezbollah, another Iranian proxy, while simultaneously supporting, or at the very least remaining neutral, the continuation of the Hezbollah and Iranian supported Assad regime in Syria. Almost two centuries ago, the British Prime Minister Lord Palmerston observed that ""Great Britain has no permanent friends, no permanent enemies, only permanent interests."" In the Gulf, the permanent interests of the United States are twofold: to ensure the free flow of oil to the rest of the world and to prevent any one party to control a significant percentage of the regions oil reserves. A rapprochement with Tehran affords Washington the strategic flexibility of siding with whichever party best allows it to protect those interests.This is a far more subtle, more nuanced foreign policy than the Obama administration has been able to execute in the past. Time will tell just how effective the White House will be in carrying it out and more significantly, the extent to which its Republican opponents in Congress will allow it the strategic flexibility to actually try to implement it. It is also a strategy that comes with considerable risk. In the short term, the end of the sanctions regime will empower Iran and will enhance its ability to carry out its aggressive policy of militant political Shiism. The immediate impact will be less stability and more chaos in the Middle East in general and the Gulf in particular. Moreover, a strategy of being the pivot around which a balance of power system revolves presupposes that there is no other pivot available to challenge ""the balancer."" In the balance of power system of nineteenth century Europe that pivot was Great Britain, and that system worked relatively well until the rise of Germany upended it. The United States is the dominant power in the Middle East and for now can act the role of the king maker, but that is a role that Russia and China are likely to challenge. A system in which the U.S. has less control is one that is also more likely to push it to the sidelines. In addition, while friendship with the United States is highly desirable for any Middle Eastern nation, the risks associated with a more opportunistic American foreign policy will also mean that those nations will ""hedge their bets."" One immediate effect will be a further, significant arms buildup in the region. Moreover, the more uncertain Saudi Arabia and its Gulf allies are about American guarantees of their security the more likely are they to reach out to countries like Pakistan or Egypt to insure those security needs.Finally, the willingness to act independently of Washington can also function to add more uncertainty in Middle East politics. Saudi Arabia's intervention in Yemen, a case in point, has given rise to what some have called ""The Salman Doctrine,"" a stated policy for preemptive, independent military intervention by Riyadh and its allies whenever a Sunni government in the Gulf of the Arabian Peninsula is threatened by Shiite unrest. While such actions may be consistent with American interests in the region and spare Washington from having to commit American military forces, they also create a more complex environment for Washington to manage. In the long run, the growing Sunni-Shia divide, the continuing rise of Iran and the ongoing chaos resulting from the combination of failed states and extremist Sunni and Shia militant groups will function to make the Middle East even more unstable in the future then it has been in the past. An opportunistic American foreign policy that relies on regional powers to maintain a balance in the region may not, ultimately, make the region any less stable, but at the very least it will reduce the cost to the United States of that instability. What is clear is that we have only begun to feel the effects of Washington's détente with Tehran."

True, Indiana and Arkansas have backed down from ""religious freedom'' laws that legitimize anti-gay discrimination. And the U.S. Supreme Court may rule this year that same-sex marriages are legal in the entire country.  But even then it won't be over. One sentence in the 2012 Republican Party platform is likely to stir up the controversy all over again: ""We reaffirm our support for a Constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman.'' That Constitutional amendment would nullify any Supreme Court decision. A lot of Republicans want to get rid of that provision in order to bring their party into the 21st century. Nearly forty percent of Republicans support same-sex marriage, including over sixty percent of Republicans under 30. ``Any political candidate who is perceived as anti-gay at the presidential level will never connect with people under 30 years old,'' a Republican pollster warned last month. On the other hand, the religious right is threatening to walk out of the convention if that plank is removed. Evangelicals are talking about mobilizing ""an army'' to keep the Republican party from backsliding. All of the potential Republican candidates for President next year oppose same-sex marriage, and they all endorsed the Indiana ""religious freedom'' law. When the Indiana legislature modified the law under pressure, Jeb Bush quickly embraced the compromise. He was for the Indiana law before he was against it. The big surprise was that the backlash to the law came as a big surprise to Republicans. ""Was I expecting this kind of backlash? Heavens no,'' Gov. Mike Pence (R-Ind.) said after a boycott Indiana movement sprang up across the country. ""This is a bill that in ordinary times would not be controversial,'' Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R-Ark.) said. ""But these are not ordinary times.'' For many Republicans, ""ordinary times'' means gays in the closet and same-sex marriage unimaginable. What happened was really a backlash to a backlash. The religious freedom laws proposed in more than a dozen states this year were a backlash to the growing acceptance and legalization of same-sex marriage. The laws were supposed to be a consolation prize to conservatives: same-sex marriages may be legal, but you can still refuse to grant them equality.  Republicans claim they backed down in Indiana and Arkansas because of a ""perception problem.'' The religious freedom laws were ""damaging the Republican brand'' and ""hurting the image'' of their states. That misses the real message: in the New America, it is no longer acceptable to stigmatize gay people.  Or African-Americans or Latinos or Asian-Americans or Jews or Muslims or working women or single mothers or the unchurched (the nearly one in five Americans who have no religious affiliation). Those groups, along with millennials and educated professionals, comprise the New America coalition that came to power with President Obama. All of them (except African-Americans and Jews) represent growing shares of the U.S. population. What holds the coalition together is a belief in diversity and inclusion. The Democratic Party, which used to be deeply divided by social and cultural issues, is amazingly unified today. It's Republicans who are facing internal dissent. And who are being thrown on the defensive on issues like gay rights, women's rights, civil rights, immigration and climate change. Republicans represent the Old America. The Old America may be losing influence but it's not giving up without a fight. The issue it's rallying around? Religion. Today, the best poll question you can ask to find out how an American votes is ""How often do you go to church?'' Regular churchgoers vote Republican. Non-churchgoers vote Democratic.  The United States remains the most religious advanced industrial country in the world. That's because many of the groups that immigrated to this country came seeking religious freedom. So the most religious people came here. Religion usually puts Democrats on the defensive because they don't want to be seen as the godless party. But Democrats have learned they can fight back by rallying around diversity and inclusion. It works, as we just saw in Indiana. Republicans were shocked -- shocked! -- to discover that gay issues have become just a big a political minefield as race."

But the story that ran on April 1 was different, mainly because it had readers wondering who was getting fooled: them, for believing that Tyler is really planning to release a country-music album, or the singer himself, for believing that he can actually pull it off.Turns out, the news was no joke -- Tyler's long-planned foray into country is apparently coming to fruition. The singer is excited; some longtime Aersomith fans, however, are not, at least based on the comments they left below the article. ""Sign of the apocalypse,"" one wrote; another called the plan ""lame and transparent.""Luckily for Tyler, though, contributors to the magazine's comments section are probably not hard-core fans of country music, a genre that steadfastly respects its elder statesman. Unlike their pop-music counterparts, country acts aren't put out to pasture once they turn 35; they are forever celebrated as legends and revered by the musicians they influenced. So if there's a genre for Tyler to cross over into, he's chosen the right one.While rock fans often seem to feel betrayed when their heroes want to try something new, country listeners tend to accept those who want to take a taste...initially, at least. In the long term, country crossovers have met with mixed success, and while Tyler will probably do pretty well -- after all, hard living, resiliency and bravado are all but prerequisites for any of the genre's male performers over age 40 -- not everyone has. Here are five men and women who made names for themselves elsewhere in the music business before dipping their toes into country-music waters.Kid Rock. At the end of the 1990s, Kid Rock was an aspiring DJ and rapper with legitimate rock-music chops who hit the big time after being booked to entertain the crowd outside an open MTV VJ audition in New York. Nearly two decades later, the ""kid"" is all grown, and has long since traded in his turntables, track suits and blunts for acoustic guitars, plaid shirts and wheat sprigs. Thanks to ""Picture,"" his massively successful duet with Sheryl Crow (who herself possesses shaky-at-best country credentials), Kid Rock quickly spring-boarded high into the country-music hierarchy, and in the years since has earned a slew of country-music award nominations, including taking home a CMA trophy for 2008's ""All Summer Long.""Darius Rucker. When the soft-rock boom that replaced grunge in the mid-1990s had faded, and groups like the Gin Blossoms and Counting Crows had seen their fans grow weary of tambourines and Hammond organs, Hootie & the Blowfish saw their own popularity float belly-up to the surface. Singer Darius Rucker ventured on a solo career, releasing an awkward R&B album before redefining himself as a country singer. Our first glimpse of the South Carolina native as a country artist was in a Burger King commercial, when he donned a purple cowboy suit and hawked a chicken sandwich, but in the decade to follow would eventually go on to country-music acclaim, becoming the first African-American solo performer to top the country charts in nearly 20 years. This summer, after years touring as an opening act for other country performers, Rucker will finally headline his own amphitheater tour.Jewel. It's not unheard of for female country acts to outgrow their cowgirl boots and move on to bigger stages (nice knowing you, Taylor Swift), but women who leave other genres behind and head to Nashville are few and far between. Jewel has never been afraid of taking risks, though, and in 2008 and 2010 released a pair of country albums that actually sold fairly well. The singer seemed to embrace not only the country-music genre, but also its very lifestyle, even moving to Texas with her then-husband, champion bull rider Ty Murray. While she has maintained some minimal presence in country music -- she starred as June Carter Cash in a 2013 biopic for the Lifetime network, for instance -- Jewel has by now all but walked away from the industry altogether. As she explained in a December blog: ""My job and my profit center have shifted away from music because music no longer makes money."" Ouch. If Jewel is hoping to mount a comeback someday, she might want to try another genre: Country fans take their music seriously, and if you're just in it for the money, you'd might as well not be in it at all.Aaron Lewis. The Staind singer cut his teeth in the late-'90s nu-metal scene that made acts like Korn, Limp Bizkit and, yes, Kid Rock stars, but later decided to switch gears and explore life as a country singer. Lewis's formidable baritone and no-nonsense approach to his music put him in line for a promising career, but despite being the voice behind huge hits like ""It's Been Awhile"" and ""Outside,"" Lewis is still playing relatively small venues and is not a major presence on country radio. Audiences may eventually be more receptive...though forgetting the lyrics during a World Series national-anthem performance probably didn't sit well with country fans, who probably also listened to his debut LP and wondered why a guy from Massachusetts suddenly had a Southern accent.David Lee Roth. The Van Halen front man is everything that country music is not: flashy, self-promoting, shameless. But that didn't stop him from singing a pair of songs on a bluegrass tribute to Van Halen in 2006. Unlike Lewis, Roth made no attempt to add a twang to his voice, and performed the reborn songs with a bluegrass band on national television, all while mugging for the camera...just the way that David Lee Roth would. Roth's foray into the periphery of country music may have been short-lived, but it happened.As Tyler prepares to start a new job at age 67, he would be wise to follow Roth's lead and just be himself: No fake accents, no trying to pretend to be southern, no exploiting country music as a way to make money. Country fans may not be hip to everyone who wants in, but they will open the door for a dude who's authentic. Even if that dude looks like a lady."

However, the real leverage in favor of a deal now is that the U.S.' European/NATO allies may no longer be prepared to continue with sanctions and certainly are not inclined toward any military response to Iran. Further, critical members of the UN Security Council as China or Russia certainly would not support continued sanctions but rather would seek to exploit such to drive a further wedge between the U.S., Europe and other evolving allies, such as India or Turkey for example.The Obama Administration knows the above developing strategic configuration. Further, it has little ability to convince the majority of the U.S. Congress of the wisdom of reaching a deal with Iran instead of some alternative that may include everything from disengagement to military confrontation. However, the Obama team, including U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry who is responsible for the continued talks, know that the U.S. Congress may find it more difficult to reject U.S. Allies, or at least the NATO and EU allies. This may turn into a blame game before U.S. allies, the UN, and U.S. voters.Obama Satisfaction in Pitting Netanyahu Versus U.S. European Allies? Israel is seen as the most influential U.S. ally, and the current Israeli Government of PM Netanyahu has taken its opposition directly to the U.S. Congress, going around and some might say above the appeal and word of the U.S. President. Obama may take some satisfaction in implicitly placing the US. .Congress in a choice between U.S.' traditional European/NATO allies or PM Netanyahu. In announcing the general framework or initial understanding, the U.S. President did not shy away from challenging senators from facing this choice. It also may be no coincidence that PM Netanyahu, along with Hamas, is at least at risk in facing an International Criminal Court (ICC) investigation as Palestine was finally admitted to the global Court, (also largely led by European states and U.S. allies although neither Israel, or the U.S. or Iran, China and Russia are members.) (See: Will Zionism and Hamas Ideology Be Criminalized?"")There is also some concern among the Arab states of the Gulf, as much about the rising influence of Tehran in the region as much as a nuclear Iran. Israel's covert development of a nuclear weapon a few decades earlier did not trigger a rapid escalation then. Today may or may not be different if Iran is seen as going nuclear. It should be noted though that Oman and some Gulf Cooperation Council members had encouraged the Iran-U.S. talks even as other members of the GCC were suspicious or weary of growing Tehran influence. Now, the GCC members face perhaps an even more direct threat from ISIS. Iran may not be a welcome collaborator in fighting ISIS, even if perhaps reluctantly seen as necessary in countering the terror groups military might in Iraq. Nonetheless, an Israeli or U.S. strike upon Iran would add to the chaos, so far ISIS greatest ally and strategic asset. Leaving Iran untethered to any nuclear agreement overtime could only add to the mix of chaos and perhaps the influence of current regimes in Beijing or Moscow. (Read: ""Has Putin Been Manipulating Energy Prices?"")Prioritizing Putin, ISIS or Iran Nuclear ThreatPutin perhaps even more so than ISIS presents the most immediate and formidable threat to Europe and the US. Bernard Henri Levy, a historic friend of Bosnia and Herzegovina and a committed Zionist friend of Israel, recently stated on the ""Charlie Rose"" interview program that Putin and ISIS are the greatest threats to Europe, (a view also shared by former NATO High Commander General Wes Clark.) The U.S. has been seeking from European allies an ever more stringent policy to confront Putin's new imperial ambitions. Division over the ""deal"" on Iran would also serve to undermine U.S. efforts to bring about a more coordinated response to Putin, whether such persists in Ukraine or arises somewhere in the Balkans, Baltics, Caucuses and/or Central Asia. Iran historically has also seen an imperial Russia as rival, but recently pushed into an alliance of convenience resisting the U.S. It is noteworthy though that at the UN and international forums Tehran conspicuously abstained from supporting Putin and the Kremlin with regards to Ukraine resolutions/statements. (Read: ""Construction According to Putin's Model, from Bosnia to Europe?"") Judging Deal by Substantive Change within Iran?The most serious challenge to the nuclear deal may be that it does not at all address the human rights record of the Tehran theocracy or statements challenging the legitimacy of Israel. However, from the perspective of the Obama Administration and most U.S. allies, the nuclear deal is seen as a first step in empowering a more progressive trend with Iran, which is also more consistent with the long history of a more refined pre and Islamic Persia. It is ironic that the greatest opponents to the ""deal"" are Iranian hardliners who see an evolution, if not revolution, that will erode their rhetoric and authority, along with PM Netanyahu and his supporters in the US Congress. The Washington lobby group ""J-Street"" which defines itself as pro-Israel and pro-peace has also maintained an open, even optimistic view of the potential versus risks of a nuclear deal. On the other hand, PM Netanyahu has less credibility in calling for Tehran to recognize Israel after refuting earlier agreements on the ""Two State Solution"" and the full establishment of a Palestinian State. Also, contrary to PM Netanyahu's rhetoric, the history of Persia is as friend of the Jewish people, most notable the deliverance by Cyrus the Great from Babylonian enslavement to the long tradition of tolerance and flourishing in Islamic Iran, at least prior to very recent times under the Mullahs. Can it be asked whether PM Netanyahu has stoked confrontation with Iran as means to deflect from his own failures to embrace a genuine peace process with the Palestinians, again an agenda he has shared with Hamas and Palestinian and Arab rejectionists of Israel? J-Street and other pro-Israel and pro-peace organizations see the current situation unsustainable which has been too frequently stoked by the instigation of conflict, pain, death, fear and mistrust by the extremes on all sides. Israel's own covert nuclear program has also not provided for it to have a direct role in outlining measures that could apply to itself as well as Tehran -- Israel has not accepted IAEA inspection or transparency regarding its own considerably more advanced nuclear program and nuclear weapons developed covertly. (Read: ""American Face to New Iran Foreign Policy."") The Iran nuclear deal continues to appear ever more as ""herding of cats"" due to the undisciplined demands and conflicting interests that collide with boundless risks and only broad parameters to build upon. The Iran nuclear deal though may be difficult to judge by what it prevents -- a negative is tough to prove. However, if the Obama/Kerry Administration and U.S. allies are to be ultimately vindicated, there must be a fundamental change within Iran, a broader rapprochement that also confronts ISIS and Putin ambitions, mutual recognition and respect as well as peace in the Israel/Palestine conflict and culminating in a nuclear free Middle East -- yes, it's a bit of herding cats, but preferable to a perpetual cycle of fangs, claws and blood. @MuhamedSacirbeyPHOTO: huffingtonpost.com"

""It leaves Iran with a vast nuclear infrastructure."" The Israeli prime minister went on to reiterate a claim he made on Friday, saying that the easing of sanctions would boost Iran's economy and free the nation to support terrorism. ""They're not going to use it for schools or hospitals or roads,"" Netanyahu said of the potential economic boost from sanctions relief. ""Martha, they're going to use it to pump up their terror machine worldwide and their military machine that is busy conquering the Middle East now.""Netanyahu proposed that the international community should therefore hold out for ""a better deal,"" in which the Iranians put a stop to ""their terrorism worldwide"" before world powers agreed to lift sanctions. The Israeli leader remained vague on how such a deal could be achieved, but drew parallels to the 2013 accord under which Syria agreed to give up its stockpile of chemical weapons amid pressure from the international community, notably Russia, and the possibility of U.S. military intervention.""How did you get a peaceful solution in Syria?"" Netanyahu asked. ""You ratcheted up the pressure.

He also claimed that allowing Iran to maintain some nuclear capabilities would cause rival states in the Middle East to seek their own nuclear weapons programs. The Israeli prime minister's television appearances are part of a wider effort by the Israeli government to lobby against the framework nuclear agreement, which it claims threatens Israel's security and is too lenient on Iran. According to The Associated Press, Israeli officials wrote an analysis listing the agreement's alleged shortcomings over the weekend. The analysis is expected to provide the basis for further opposition by Netanyahu. "

Columbia University’s Graduate School of Journalism is expected to release an investigation on the magazine's handling of the story on Sunday at 8 pm EST.According to Stelter, Rubin-Erdely will also issue a formal apology. 'A Rape on Campus,' published in November, was initially lauded for exposing a horrible crime, as well as a culture of apathy and misogyny that allowed the alleged assailants to get away with it. However, the report was called into question after several of the victim's friend's came forward to say that the night of her alleged assault didn't unfold as the Rolling Stones report said it did. A Washington Post report also cast doubt on the identity of the alleged attackers. In December, Rolling Stone admitted that it made a mistake by not contacting any of the accused fraternity members out of respect for the victim.

24,POLITICS,Working Parents Should Be Very Happy About This Obscure Senate Vote,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paid-sick-days_n_6999830.html,,2015-04-05,"WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 03: Senator Patty Murray speaks at a panel during EMILY's List 30th Anniversary Gala at Washington Hilton on March 3, 2015 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Kris Connor/Getty Images for EMILY's List)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f1251f00000002257cc5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Something pretty remarkable happened late last month while the Senate was voting on the annual budget resolution. And it had very little to do with the budget. On March 26, while individual senators were introducing amendments as part of a process known as “vote-a-rama,” Patty Murray (D-Wash.) offered up what she called a ""paid sick day"" proposal. Her idea is to guarantee that all Americans can take up to seven days off from work a year, with pay, in order to get better from an illness or to take care of a sick family member. Labor unions and women’s groups love the idea. The business community pretty much detests it. That opposition helps explain why the idea has never gotten much traction in Congress, even though it's been kicked around for a long time.Murray has taken up the leadership on the issue in the Senate, now that its previous champion, Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), has retired. But as Murray’s aides and allies tell it, the senator did not spend a lot of time trying to rally supporters or persuade wavering colleagues on this particular vote. She figured that most of her fellow Democrats would vote yes. She hoped that a handful of Republicans might do the same, so that she could claim majority support for the concept -- 51 votes, or maybe one or two more if she was really lucky. She ended up with 61. “We weren’t expecting to get the level of support we got,"" a Murray aide told The Huffington Post. Vicki Shabo, vice president of the National Partnership for Women and Families, agreed. “There was not a big lobbying effort around this amendment,” she said. “The vote was a surprise -- but a very positive surprise.”The breakdown of the vote was particularly interesting. In all, 14 Republicans voted to support the amendment. Conspicuous on the “ayes” list were Kelly Ayotte from New Hampshire, Mark Kirk from Illinois, Rob Portman from Ohio and several other incumbents up for reelection in states that have voted Democratic or have been up for grabs in the last two presidential elections. In fact, two such Republicans, Pat Toomey from Pennsylvania and Ron Johnson from Wisconsin, switched their votes at the last minute to join the majority. One possible reason for the strong showing: Murray refused requests to consider the amendment on a voice vote only, according to sources familiar with what happened behind the scenes. Murray pushed for a roll call, which meant votes would be recorded -- and possible fodder in the 2016 elections. Any Republican who voted against the amendment would have to explain that vote to constituents. This doesn’t mean paid sick leave is about to become law. The budget resolution isn’t binding legislation. It’s merely a set of instructions to congressional committees as they set out to write legislation. Amendments like Murray’s are typically vague and largely symbolic -- designed to demonstrate support for a particular idea, force adversaries to make unpopular votes, or some combination of the two.After the vote, aides to some Republicans who voted for the bill assured reporters that their bosses were merely expressing support for the idea of paid sick leave, not any specific legislation that Murray and her allies had in mind. But the prospect of voting against paid sick leave in the abstract obviously spooked a bunch of vulnerable Senate Republicans. That may say something about the level of political support, not just for paid sick days but also for what’s come to be known as the “working families” agenda -- an agenda that’s likely to figure prominently in the 2016 presidential campaign.A Revolution In Family Life, Not Yet In PolicyThe agenda is a reaction to a profound sociological shift in family life that’s been underway for decades. In 1960, the majority of households with children had at least one parent at home, and the majority of women with children stayed out of the workforce. Today that’s no longer true, as more than 60 percent of households with children have no parents staying at home, and women make up nearly half the labor force. This has created new stresses and strains on families, particularly families with very young children. These parents need time off from work, whether it's a few days to nurse a sick kid or a few months to care for a newborn. They need child care and, ideally, some kind of prekindergarten to prepare kids for school.In pretty much every other developed country, government acts aggressively to meet these needs -- by subsidizing or directly providing early child care, for example, and by guaranteeing that parents can take time off, with pay, to care for newborns and sick relatives. That’s not the case here in the U.S., where the law requires very little, and such benefits are largely a function of whether employers offer them. That works out well enough for employees of large, generous corporations -- and not so well for everybody else.  Infographic by Alissa Scheller for The Huffington Post.Predictably, the workers least likely to have such benefits tend to be in lower-paying industries, like fast food or retail, or those piecing together low-paying, part-time and contingent work. Paid sick days, the cause Murray is pushing, are a prime example of the kind of options these workers lack. Among people whose incomes place them into the highest quartile, 85 percent have paid sick days, according to the Economic Policy Institute. Among people in the lowest quartile, just 30 percent do. And because responsibility for caregiving falls disproportionately to women, the inability to get paid days off or find affordable child care has forced them to make career choices -- like slowing their advancement or abandoning jobs altogether -- that reinforce gender inequality.Efforts to bolster government programs and protections for working parents in this country have proceeded in fits and starts, thanks to a familiar set of obstacles. For one thing, initiatives typically require some combination of government regulation and spending. Those are tough to secure when either funds are scarce or Republicans, backed by corporate lobbies, have control over one branch of government -- conditions that have existed for most of the last few decades. It also hasn’t helped that, until very recently, large numbers of Americans were, at best, ambivalent about the role of women in the workplace. The last time Congress passed a major piece of legislation with the sole purpose of helping workers balance work and family was in 1993, when the Democratic-controlled House and Senate passed the Family and Medical Leave Act, guaranteeing up to six weeks of leave for employees of large firms who needed time to care for a new baby or sick relative. It was historic legislation -- the very first bill that Bill Clinton signed as president. Getting the law passed took a herculean political effort, spanning years, and the law has one big limitation: Because it requires companies to provide unpaid leave, not paid leave, many workers can’t afford to use it.But political conditions change, and there are reasons to think the support for such policies may be stronger now. For one thing, the financial strain on families is greater, creating more demand for help. Child care costs may be the most vivid example. According to the Census Bureau, a working mother in 1985 could expect to pay, on average, $87 a week for child care. By 2011, that working mother could expect to pay $148 a week -- an increase of 70 percent. (Those numbers are adjusted for inflation.) And relative to the 1980s, advocates for policies like paid leave and child care support are more likely to find lawmakers -- including men -- who understand firsthand the kind of pressure working parents face. That’s true of state legislatures and Congress and that’s true of the White House, where President Barack Obama has spoken frequently about the challenges he and Michelle faced when their kids were young and both of them had promising professional careers ahead of them. One more factor that could help: Experts are compiling more evidence about the effect that programs like paid leave can have on businesses and the economy. Critics have long maintained that such policies would hurt employers and ultimately slow economic growth. The latest evidence suggests otherwise -- in part because such policies can improve retention and allow women, who increasingly have high skills, to stay in the workforce if they wish. Success In The States, Struggles In WashingtonAdvocates for more generous child care and leave policies have already made some gains at the state and local level. Paid sick leave was on the ballot in four places last year -- three cities and one state, Massachusetts. It passed in all four. The process is taking longer at the federal level, but it's clearly underway. The White House has made work-family issues a major priority for Obama’s second term -- by issuing reports on the productivity lost when women can’t pursue career aspirations; by staging summits and other White House events on the needs of working families; and by proposing or endorsing major initiatives for universal prekindergarten, paid leave and tax credits to help parents with children. On Capitol Hill, work-family issues have been a longtime cause for such veteran Democrats as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Rosa DeLauro from Connecticut. But particularly in the Senate, up-and-coming Democrats are staking their own claim to the agenda. Kirstin Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) has been waging a crusade on behalf of paid leave, and Bob Casey (D-Penn.) recently proposed a major new tax credit for families paying for child care. “You don’t want to blow things out of proportion,” said Heather Boushey, executive director and chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. “But I’ve been in D.C. since 2000 working on these issues, and it’s feeling avalanche-y. There’s a lot going on.”The Democrats sponsoring these pieces of legislation are optimistic about the prospects for passing legislation, even with Republicans in charge of both houses of Congress. And maybe those statements aren’t quite as naive as they sound. After Obama unveiled his own version of a child care tax credit, Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell identified it as the one idea on the president’s agenda they could support. But with Congress struggling to pass even routine legislation, and dollars for new programs in short supply, it will probably take the 2016 campaign to focus attention on these issues -- and, eventually, rally constituencies for passing laws.Hillary Clinton, the Democrats’ likely nominee, seems poised to make this case. She has a long history of advocating for these sorts of programs, going back to the 1970s and her work with the Children’s Defense Fund. And while her demurral about paid family leave in a CNN interview last summer got lots of attention, advocates say they aren’t worried and expect a strong work-family agenda to be part of her campaign.The big unknown is how Republicans will react -- and this is why, ultimately, the Murray vote may be more significant than the garden-variety budget measure. If the Murray vote proved anything, it’s that Republicans can read the same polls as Democrats. In a 2013 HuffPost/YouGov poll, 74 percent of respondents said they would support a requirement that all employers offer paid sick leave. Republicans recognize that voters crave stronger, more generous supports for working parents, or at least like the sound of them. Of course, opposition to these measures remains strong. As Dave Weigel of Bloomberg pointed out, every Senate Republican also running for president voted no on Murray's amendment. If the political pressure gets intense, the GOP could simply offer up a different agenda -- one that sounds similar to what Democrats are proposing, but actually accomplishes less. An example would be the “Working Family Flexibility Act,” which is a Republican proposal for making paid sick leave more widely available. The initiative would require that employees build up overtime hours in order to get paid leave -- and then give employers discretion over when employees can take it.Some labor advocates consider the Republican proposal nothing more than an attempt to undermine guarantees of overtime pay, on which many low- and medium-income families rely.Could such proposals be the basis for future compromise, if not in this Congress than in a subsequent one? Are they simply an attempt to deflect criticism from voters who want action on work-family issues? It’s difficult to know. But it’s unlikely Republicans can simply avoid these issues altogether. Democrats have taken notice of the success that Murray had. They’ll be back for more.Dave Jamieson contributed reporting."

Forty years ago this month, as the U.S. was scrambling to leave Vietnam, a Connecticut businessman had such an impulse. His story encourages all of us not to walk away, but rather to embrace the inclination and act -- the reward might be extraordinary. Amid news of the U.S. exit from Vietnam, Bob Macauley saw that a plane full of orphaned babies and toddlers heading to the U.S. for adoption had crashed on takeoff and the survivors were stranded in an increasingly unstable Saigon. Frustrated that it would take 10 days to rescue the children, Bob thought, ""I should do something.""He and his wife, Leila, kited a check, chartered a Pan Am 747, pulled strings to get authorization for the mission and brought back 325 young children that had been living in orphanages in South Vietnam. The plane landed in San Francisco on April 5, 1975, amid great fanfare. President Gerald Ford helped carry the children off the plane -- a moment captured for all the world to see by waiting news crews. President Gerald R. Ford, courtesy of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential LibraryThe Macauleys didn't hesitate. They acted on impulse -- that first rush when your heart is open and there is no what-if or why-not, before the mind parses the benefits and drawbacks of any action and sends out a little voice saying, ""It won't make a real difference"" or ""It's inconvenient."" They acted before they were distracted by the next thing and played an important, albeit little-known, role in a story that captured headlines around the world. The reward has been great. For many of the rescued orphans, the reward was the miracle of new life. A Florida man, who was 3 years old when he came to the U.S. as part of Operation Babylift, recently wrote a letter to the Macauleys saying, ""You gave me and my brother a life of opportunity with a loving family that were able to provide us with love, care, compassion and support. I owe my life to you.""For the Macauleys, the reward was the opening of a door to years of acts of compassion around the globe. They went on to found a nonprofit humanitarian aid agency called AmeriCares with the goal, in Bob's own words, to ""find someone who needs help and help them."" Bob passed away in 2010. Leila lives in Florida and remains engaged as the vice-chair of the AmeriCares board. Leila still receives letters and emails from the PanAm passengers who find her to say thank you.I have the great honor to sit in Bob's seat as the CEO of AmeriCares. We have grown into a sophisticated global organization with hundreds of employees, tens of thousands of donors, deep relationships with corporations and other humanitarian aid agencies, a vast network of partner hospitals, clinics, social service agencies and others across the globe and more. We literally help millions of people every year. Still, it is Bob's impulse to act out of compassion to help someone in crisis that remains at the heart of our identity and work. The founding stories of many charities include similar stories of people who followed an impulse to act. But most acts of generosity don't end in an airplane charter or global nonprofit. Instead, they are singular incidents that help one person or family find relief, restoration or redemption. Multiplied over and over again, these independent acts amount to more than a single charity could ever accomplish. The opportunity to make a difference is open to each of us nearly every day -- we just have to honor the impulse and act.________________ Michael J.

It was the first time advertisers stopped targeting their potential customers either by the location (website) or by their basic demographics (Women, married, household income >$100,000) and started targeting them by their behavior and intent. The pay per click advertising model was born and allowed advertisers to show ads based on potential customers interests. So that instead of blanketing the sports section of Yahoo! to sell baseball gloves to potential customers, you could now only show them ads to your business when they searched for things (baseball equipment, baseball gloves, catcher's mitt, etc).Take a look at advertising options today, and you can target ads to people who have actually visited your website or liked a competitor's website that sells baseball equipment. You can show ads to people who live in a particular zip code, who only drive Nissan Muranos and are fans of Chicago Cubs. Advertisers are tapping into the world of big data to get a much better understanding of who their audience is, what they like and buy and all their psychographic and purchase preferences. If Advertising Has Evolved, Why Hasn't Most of the Retail Site Selection Process Evolved?There are two parts to deciding on a retail brick and mortar location: the science and the art. Some retailers, like Starbucks employ more science than smaller operations that can't afford to deploy science, or, if not constrained by capital, definitely constrained by expertise. Or, in some laughable cases, retailers do a ""follow the Starbucks"" strategy -- which is worse because they are assuming a Starbucks customer is their ideal customer.The ""tip"" of the science iceberg is setting minimum demographic requirements before a retailer will even consider a location. The problem is that this is where their science ends for the majority of retail brands. If a location hits a demographic threshold, they then typically jump right into the art side of choosing a location. Here are a few popular brands and their general site selection demographic criteria.Manchu Wok -- looks for: ""Average HH Income: $30,000-$80,000. Per Capita Income: $15,000-$40,000. Daytime Population: 10,000.""Manchu Wok signed up with a market-leading service that has been helping companies pick locations for years. Using the basic demographic information similar to Manchu Wok's they ended up with a location that looked like they had the right demos but only produced 20% of expected sales when many of their other locations were thriving. Why? IdealSpot, a commercial real estate analysis company, found that only a tiny percentage of people living and working in the neighborhood they moved to actually ate Asian food in the past six months. That one variable was a better predictor of success than all the drive by traffic, household income and population data you could get. Jamba Juice -- looks for: ""Average age less than 38 years. Daytime employment greater than 15,000 in 2 mile radius. Strong vehicular and pedestrian traffic counts. Average Household income of $50,000 - $75,000."" A similar Juice and smoothie retailer - ""Median Household income $75,000+. Population in 3 mile radius-150,000+. Median age: 18-45 yrs.""IdealSpot analyzed their data and found that none of these demographic factors are true predictors of a success location. They would not reveal what their analysis found since they treat their clients' data with utmost confidentiality. John Prior, IdealSpot's VP of Data Science told me, ""Most of the analysts and business owners trying to evaluate new locations ""the old fashioned way"" (spreadsheets overflowing with old data and preconceived notions) seem to have a limited view of the factors that might affect the success or failure of a particular brick-and-mortar location. Like, how visible is it to traffic? How accessible? What times of day? How much disposable income do nearby residents have?Those are all good questions to know the answers to, but are they enough? Do analysts compare their initial data points to the actual success or failure of a business? And why are they only looking at 10 or 20 inputs? This is where most analyses ""hit the wall"" -- people will spend lots of time and money collecting piles of data, but then have no way to relate it to success or failure of their business. This is how businesses end up with locations that can fall far short of their expectations.""IdealSpot analyzes over 15,000+ inputs for each and every location they evaluate. In addition to the ""traditional"" inputs (such as demographics, retail sales, buying trends of residents lying within a X-minute drive time), they have access to social media trends and internet search patterns. Is this the future of retail analysis? Probably, it certainly makes sense. It also makes sense to use that data to determine if an area around an existing retail store is changing. That might give the retailer early notice that a location change is in order."
