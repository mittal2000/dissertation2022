But in my opinion, I would say the opportunities",2013-10-20,"LONDON, ENGLAND - SEPTEMBER 13: Logos for the microblogging site Twitter, displayed on the internet on September 13, 2013 in London, England. Twitter has announced plans to float on the stockmarket. (Photo by Mary Turner/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb36af52400005000975b7d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Alexei OreskovicSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Retired schoolteacher Donald Hovasse signed up for Twitter about a year ago at the urging of his daughter. He lost interest after trying the service a few times and finding lots of celebrities but few of his friends using the online social network.""I didn't really get the point of it at all,"" said the Las Vegas resident. ""Most of them were people I wasn't interested in hearing what they had to say anyway."" He said, however, that he does check Facebook every day to see what his friends are up to.Hovasse's experience highlights a risk for investors as Twitter Inc marches towards this year's most anticipated initial public offering in the United States, expected to begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange in mid-November.According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, 36 percent of 1,067 people who have joined Twitter say they do not use it, and 7 percent say they have shut their account. The online survey, conducted October 11 to 18, has a credibility interval, a measure of its accuracy, of plus or minus 3.4 percentage points.In comparison, only 7 percent of 2,449 Facebook members report not using the online social network, and 5 percent say they have shut down their account. The results have a credibility interval of 2.3 percent.People who have given up on Twitter cite a variety of reasons, from lack of friends on the service to difficulty understanding how to use it. Twitter declined to comment for this story, saying it is in a quiet period ahead of its IPO.Twitter's attrition rate highlights a challenge that has dogged the online messaging site over the years: while it has managed to enlist many high-profile and avid users, from the Pope to President Barack Obama, Twitter has yet to go truly mainstream in the way Facebook has.Convincing ordinary people to think of Twitter as an indispensable part of their lives is key to the company's ability to attract advertisers and generate a profit.Twitter reported it had 232 million ""active"" users - people who access the service at least once a month - at the end of September, up 6.1 percent from the end of June. Twitter's quarter-over-quarter growth in active users has not exceeded 11 percent since June 2012.When Facebook was a similar size, its active users were increasing by more than 20 percent every quarter, and it was not until the social network neared the half-a-billion member mark that its user growth decelerated to 12 percent.""Twitter is a great service, it's still got growth in front of it. But in my opinion, I would say the opportunities are less than that of Facebook, and it has to be valued appropriately,"" said Dan Niles, chief investment officer of tech-focused hedge fund firm AlphaOne Capital Partners.""The data would seem to imply that the ultimate revenue potential for this company is less than for Facebook,"" Niles said, referring to Twitter's number of active users.Twitter's revenue in the third quarter more than doubled from the year before to $168.6 million, while its net loss tripled to $64.6 million. Analysts expect Facebook, which is due to report its third-quarter results later this month, to bring in $1.9 billion in quarterly revenue.QUITTERSTwitter aims to become the ""fabric of every communication in the world"" and to eventually reach every person on the planet, Chief Executive Dick Costolo has said. Still, Twitter acknowledged in its IPO prospectus that ""new users may initially find our product confusing.""The company prides itself on staying true to its roots: it lets people send 140-character messages and does not pack in scads of extraneous functions. Since its inception, Twitter has resisted overtly manipulating how people use its platform, instead preferring conventions to be formed organically.As a result, new users often find it initially difficult to grasp how discussions ebb and flow, complaining that features such as the ""hashtags"" that group Tweets by topic, abbreviations for basic functions (for instance, RT for retweet) and shortened Web links, are geared towards a technologically-savvy crowd.""The average person that's coming on here, they're still baffled by it,"" said Larry Cornett, a former executive at Yahoo Inc and designer at Apple Inc, who now runs product strategy and design consulting firm Brilliant Forge.""If they want the mass adoption and that daily engagement, they have to make it really easy for people to consume.""According to the Reuters/Ipsos poll, 38 percent of 2,217 people who do not use Twitter said they did not find it that interesting or useful. Thirteen percent said they do not understand what to use Twitter for. The results have a credibility interval of 2.4 percent.Twitter has taken steps to help new members. In December 2011, it introduced a new ""Discover"" section to highlight the most popular discussion topics based on a person's location and interests.The company also simplified some features and rolled out new tools that embed photos and videos directly in a person's tweet stream, making for a richer and easier-to-use experience.These changes may mean that Twitter's retention rate for the past several months is better than its overall retention rate, which includes people who joined years ago, say analysts.Brian Wieser, an analyst with Pivotal Research Group, said Twitter's current user base is already big enough to be valuable to advertisers. Investors need to get more comfortable with the idea that Twitter is not for everyone, he said.""The practical matter is that this is a niche medium,"" he said. ""Their appeal, they will never be as broad as Facebook.""(Editing by Edwin Chan and Tiffany Wu)"

9,WELLNESS,What To Look For In A Can (Or Box) Of Soup,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/healthy-soups_us_5b9d97dde4b03a1dcc89e9b6,"Surprisingly, many vegetable soups have egg ingredients and wheat when I would expect just to see veggies. While ""100 percent",2013-10-19,"Campbell Soup Co. Campbell's and Swanson brand products sit on display at a supermarket in Princeton, Illinois, U.S., on Wednesday, Aug. 22, 2012. Campbell Soup Co., the world?s largest soup maker, reported a 27 percent increase in fiscal fourth-quarter net income as sales of its core Simple Meals business improved. Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d97dd3c000032000a35f5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Keri Gans for U.S. NewsFinally there is a chill in the air, at least in New York City. I don't know about you, but when the temperature starts lowering, my appetite for soup starts rising. Problem is, I can never find the time to make soup from scratch.More From U.S. News: 15 Healthy Snacks for Fall Mastering the Art of Food Shopping 10 Tips for a Healthy FallI'm sure there are a lot of quick recipes out there, but I tend to hit the supermarket, scouting the shelves for something that I feel is healthy enough to bring home. Trust me, I find this task daunting, so I thought I would share with you what it is I look for when making a soup can (or box) worthy of purchase. Here's what I found on a trip to my local supermarket this week:Sodium: Probably the scariest number on a can of soup is the sodium content. I found this to range from a beautiful 50 milligrams all the way to a whopping 940 milligrams for a one-cup serving. The latter is around 40 percent of one's sodium needs, based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's recommended daily value of 2400 milligrams. Trust me, that is a soup you want to pass on.Don't be fooled by labels including ""organic,"" ""light"" or even ""healthy,"" because that doesn't seem to affect the manufacturer's amount of salt. However, I did find that those labeled ""light in sodium,"" ""low sodium"" or ""no added salt"" were on the lower end of the sodium range (50 to 160 milligrams) and were acceptable amounts.Fat: When it comes to soups, this nutrient doesn't seem to make much of a difference and wouldn't really affect my choice. Luckily, none of the soups I saw had trans fats because that would have been a total deterrent for purchase. Total fat ranged from 0 to 9 grams and saturated fat from 0 to 5 grams, and this includes the ""creamy"" soups.Fiber: Since the average American does not meet his or her daily fiber needs, I am always on the lookout for foods that shine in this nutrient. The higher the fiber, the more likely I would buy a brand -- as long as the sodium is not out of control. The range I found was 0 to 8 grams, the latter coming from soups that are bean-based such as lentil and black bean.Protein: The amount of protein ranged from 1 to 9 grams. If you are enjoying the soup as part of your meal -- for example, with a sandwich -- than 1 gram is OK. But if you're having soup as your sole snack or lunch, then the more, the better. Protein helps to fill us up and, if it's lacking in your bowl, then you may be hungry sooner than later.Calories: The key here is to look first at serving size and the number of servings in the can or box. Most cans include two servings, and most of the boxes contain four. Calories ranged from as low as 15 per serving for a broth to 220 per serving for a lentil soup.Just like with the protein, the choice depends on when you are having the soup and whether you're having something else with it. If it's your main meal, you could easily have 2 cups of the 220-calorie brand; however, if you're also having a sandwich, you would do better to choose a soup with around 100 calories per serving. Overall, soup can actually help to fill you up if enjoyed as an ""appetizer,"" but if it contains too many calories, it may just fill you out.Ingredients: As with almost everything that comes in a can or a box, you should read the ingredient label very closely. For me, if I see MSG, artificial flavoring or caramel on the label, the soup stays on the shelf because I really don't see the point of them being included in the recipe.Surprisingly, many vegetable soups have egg ingredients and wheat when I would expect just to see veggies. While ""100 percent natural"" may lead you to think a soup is healthy, there is no set definition by the FDA for this labeling, and you might be surprised what you find on the ingredient list. As per my dear friend, Bonnie Taub-Dix, fellow registered dietitian and blogger for Eat + Run: ""Read It Before You Eat It."" Very wise words.Ideally, we probably should be making our own soups. My other close pal and registered dietitian Dawn Jackson Blatner promised me that the below recipe from her book, ""The Flexitarian Diet"" is so simple it can be made in less than 15 minutes with minimal ingredients. Hmmm? This might actually be less time than I spend scouring the aisle for the perfect soup.Nutrition info (serving size = 1 cup): 170 calories, 4.5 fat (0.5 grams saturated), 0 milligrams cholesterol, 220 milligrams sodium, 31 grams carbohydrates, 7 grams fiber, 10 grams sugar, 8 grams protein"
