Japanese and Chinese shares led Asian markets higher Wednesday as the Nikkei touched a fresh high on the yen's slump and Chinese business surveys offered some optimism about the world's No. 2 economy. (AP Photo/Eugene Hoshiko)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14556240000320076f274.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(Reuters) - Japan's economy rebounded from recession to grow an annualized 2.2 percent in the final quarter of last year, giving a much-needed boost to premier Shinzo Abe's efforts to shake off decades of stagnation even as the global outlook deteriorates.But the expansion was smaller than a 3.7 percent increase forecast in a Reuters poll, suggesting a fragile recovery for the world's third-largest economy as consumer mood remained soft and uneven global growth weighed on exports.Still, the return to growth will allow the Bank of Japan to hold off on expanding monetary stimulus in coming months, even as slumping oil prices push inflation further away from its 2 percent target, analysts say.The data will be one of the key factors the BOJ will scrutinize at its two-day rate review ending on Wednesday, where it is widely set to maintain the current pace of asset purchases in its monetary stimulus program.The preliminary reading for gross domestic product (GDP), which translates into a quarter-on-quarter increase of 0.6 percent, follows two straight quarters of contraction blamed on the hit on consumption from a sales tax hike last April.External demand added 0.2 percentage point to growth in the quarter, a sign the weak yen was finally driving up exports.Private consumption, which makes up about 60 percent of the economy, rose 0.3 percent in the final quarter, less than a median market forecast for a 0.7 percent increase.Japan's economy slid into recession in July-September last year, prompting Abe to delay a second sales tax hike initially scheduled in October 2015.The slump slowed Japan's quest to beat off nearly two decades of grinding deflation, and forced the BOJ into expanding monetary stimulus in October last year.(Additional reporting by Stanley White; Editing by Shri Navaratnam)"

Pope Francis announced yesterday that he will elevate four women to sainthood in May, all nuns who lived in the 19th century and founded Catholic orders -- one French, one Italian and two Palestinians. The canonisation will take place on May 17, the pope announced at the end of a consistory, or a meeting of cardinals, at the Vatican.

They were killed simply for the fact that they were Christians,"" Francis said in his native Spanish, departing from the Italian he uses at most formal events.The leader of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, who has said it is ""lawful"" to stop an unjust aggressor, went on:""The blood of our Christian brothers and sisters is a testimony which cries out be heard. It makes no difference whether they be Catholics, Orthodox, Copts or Protestants. They are Christians!""Francis added: ""The martyrs belong to all Christians.""Egypt, where Christians make up around a tenth of a predominantly Muslim population, is stepping up its battle against Islamist militants in neighboring Libya.The Coptic Church is founded on the teachings of St. Mark who took Christianity to Egypt during the reign of the Roman emperor Nero."

""Here I'm fighting for a people and for a faith, and the enemy is much bigger and more brutal.""Thousands of foreigners have flocked to Iraq and Syria in the past two years, mostly to join Islamic State, but a handful of idealistic Westerners are enlisting as well, citing frustration their governments are not doing more to combat the ultra-radical Islamists or prevent the suffering of innocents.The militia they joined is called Dwekh Nawsha - meaning self-sacrifice in the ancient Aramaic language spoken by Christ and still used by Assyrian Christians, who consider themselves the indigenous people of Iraq.A map on the wall in the office of the Assyrian political party affiliated with Dwekh Nawsha marks the Christian towns in northern Iraq, fanning out around the city of Mosul.The majority are now under control of Islamic State, which overran Mosul last summer and issued am ultimatum to Christians: pay a tax, convert to Islam, or die by the sword. Most fled.Dwekh Nawsha operates alongside Kurdish peshmerga forces to protect Christian villages on the frontline in Nineveh province.""These are some of the only towns in Nineveh where church bells ring. In every other town the bells have gone silent, and that's unacceptable,"" said Brett, who has ""The King of Nineveh"" written in Arabic on the front of his army vest.Brett, who like other foreign volunteers withheld his last name out of concern for his family's safety, is the only one to have engaged in fighting so far.The others, who arrived just last week, were turned back from the frontline on Friday by Kurdish security services who said they needed official authorisation. ""STOP SOME ATROCITIES""Tim shut down his construction business in Britain last year, sold his house and bought two plane tickets to Iraq: one for himself and another for a 44-year-old American software engineer he met through the internet.The men joined up at Dubai airport, flew to the Kurdish city of Suleimaniyah and took a taxi to Duhok, where they arrived last week.""I'm here to make a difference and hopefully put a stop to some atrocities,"" said 38-year-old Tim, who previously worked in the prison service. ""I'm just an average guy from England really.""Scott, the software engineer, served in the U.S. Army in the 1990s, but lately spent most of his time in front of a computer screen in North Carolina.He was mesmerized by images of Islamic State militants hounding Iraq's Yazidi minority and became fixated on the struggle for the Syrian border town of Kobani -- the target of a relentless campaign by the jihadists, who were held off by the lightly armed Kurdish YPG militia, backed by U.S. air strikes.Scott had planned to join the YPG, which has drawn a flurry of foreign recruits, but changed his mind four days before heading to the Middle East after growing suspicious of the group's ties to the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).He and the other volunteers worried they would not be allowed home if they were associated with the PKK, which the United States and Europe consider a terrorist organization. They also said they disliked the group's leftist ideology.The only foreign woman in Dwekh Nawsha's ranks said she had been inspired by the role of women in the YPG, but identified more closely with the ""traditional"" values of the Christian militia.Wearing a baseball cap over her balaclava, she said radical Islam was at the root of many conflicts and had to be contained.All the volunteers said they were prepared to stay in Iraq indefinitely.""Everyone dies,"" said Brett, asked about the prospect of being killed. ""One of my favorite verses in the Bible says: be faithful unto death, and I shall give you the crown of life."" (Editing by Stephen Kalin and Stephen Powell)"

He also took on Obama, arguing that ""what this Harvard professor who is president of our United States does not understand is that a trial court's decision on the constitutionality of a federal question is just that, it's an opinion."" ""This is not the first time you have run up against the federal courts,"" Wallace told Moore. ""Back in 2003, you ignored a U.S. federal court of appeals ruling that you must remove a 2-ton granite monument of the Ten Commandments from the state capitol. At that point, sir, in Alabama, a state ethics panel said you had to be removed from office because you had put yourself above the law. Aren't you doing the same thing now, sir?""Moore responded by hinting at the possibility of future judicial activism. ""I was obeying the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, which does not prohibit the acknowledgement of God,"" he said. ""When federal courts start changing our Constitution by defining words that are not even there, like marriage, they're going to do the same thing with family in the future.""In a separate interview on Sunday, Judge Steven L. Reed, the first probate judge in the state to publicly announce he would issue same-sex marriage licenses, said he ""didn't ask for [Moore's] opinion and frankly didn't need it. The federal judge told us what we needed to do, and to me that was as clear-cut as I needed in order to make a decision.""Reed said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" that he wasn't bothered that same-sex marriage remains unpopular in Alabama, and called Moore's decision ""a desperate attempt to defy the federal government."" ""I think that's what places Alabama a step backwards in some people's eyes when they see things like this happen, the defiance and the resistance,"" Reed said. ""I think we're on the front side of this. And we're on the right side of history where this is concerned."""

Catholic groups are decrying a recent Louisiana Supreme Court decision that reaches into the most sanctified of Catholic places, the confessional booth. The high court has revived a sex abuse lawsuit in which parents are suing a priest and a local diocese for not reporting the alleged abuse when the teenager told the priest about it, and the ruling could have a priest asked to testify about what was said in a private confession. The Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights says the ruling leaves the priest choosing between prison and excommunication, in a case that has grabbed attention in heavily Catholic south Louisiana. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7fb1d200000c101018aac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) — The youngest priest in the Diocese of Baton Rouge has a few confessions about his faith and his music: He didn't like the Catholic Church as a youth, tried for years to run from his calling as a priest, and doesn't want to be known only as the ""Rapping Priest.""The Rev. Joshua Johnson, serving at Christ the King Catholic Church at Louisiana State University, is 27, and in his first year as a priest.""I was raised Catholic, but I just never liked the Catholic Church growing up. I thought it was boring, and I didn't understand it,"" said Johnson, a native of Baton Rouge whose rapping has brought him a measure of renown on YouTube and social media. He hosts the hip-hop show ""Tell the World"" on Catholic radio.Johnson's biggest difficulty with the church was with the Eucharist: ""I never believed that it was the body and blood of Jesus Christ that the Catholic Church teaches.""That changed one summer night before his senior year at Lee High School, during a retreat in Alexandria. He attended ""Eucharistic Adoration,"" when a piece of consecrated altar bread — the Holy Eucharist or host — is the focus of devotion and meditation.""That night in adoration, when the bishop exposed Jesus Christ with the Eucharist, all I could say was it was God's grace that overcame me,"" Johnson said. ""And looking at the Eucharistic prayer, I knew it was God, that it was Jesus Christ. It was as if I fell in love in an instant. I started crying. I was on my knees worshipping God.""The long ache in his heart was lifted, he said.""The first thing I heard him say was 'I love you,' and it pierced my heart then and it continues to pierce my heart today, because I was living in pretty serious sin, but he told me he loved me.""Johnson said he was also told to become a priest. Instead, he said, he enrolled at Southern University.""I didn't want to be a priest, and I was trying to run away from it.""But during his 1½ semesters at Southern, ""I could not stop thinking about the priesthood.""After a stint with the post office and endless days attending a 24-hour adoration chapel, Johnson enrolled in St. Joseph's Seminary College in Covington in 2006, earning his master's in theology from Notre Dame Seminary in New Orleans.""Those were some of the best years of my life,"" he said. ""It was a time of deep intimacy with Jesus because you had a lot of time to pray and a lot of time to study.""And a bit of time to hone his rapping skills, to the enjoyment of some fellow seminarians.""I grew up rapping just for fun,"" he said. At seminary, ""I continued to do it for fun and people started hearing me, and the next thing you know I'm doing it at festivals and youth conferences.""Rapping is one of the God-given gifts he uses outside of Mass to witness for Christ, Johnson said.""I've had people come to me only after seeing my music on YouTube or Facebook and say, 'I'm coming to you because I've seen this video and I want to give to my life to Christ now.'""Some people have told him they don't like it, ""but I'm pretty sure all the apostles didn't appreciate all the other apostles' gifts,"" he said. ""I know I got to keep my eyes fixed on God and what God has called me to do.""Johnson said he's trying use to his gift to please God.""Rap in and of itself is not evil; it's not a sin. It's part of the culture,"" he said. ""We can use that. We're not called to reject the culture; we're called to go into the culture and promote what's good.""Johnson said he can't recall seeing a black priest during his childhood, so he never thought about growing up to become a priest. Now, he said, ""I'm a visible witness to the fact that God calls black men to be priests, too.""In May, Johnson will be a keynote speaker for a conference about race: The St. Martin De Porres Conference, May 8-9 at the Catholic Life Center in Baton Rouge. It's named for the patron saint of interracial harmony, born in 16th-century Peru to a Spanish nobleman and former black slave.""The idea is to bring whites and blacks together from the area to experience the healing power of Christ together,"" Johnson said.Johnson has worked with all kinds of people and cultures all over the world, from New Orleans and Houston to Mexico, Nicaragua and India.He especially enjoys working with students at LSU, which has 14,000 Catholics.""I love working with young adults because they have a real fire and a desire to be saints,"" Johnson said. ""I enjoy working with people on their way to encountering Jesus for the first time and those people who have already encountered him.""Johnson said he relates well with the students and is honest with them.""I can't stand when people make it seem like all you have to do is accept Jesus Christ in your life and everything is going to be easier and holiness is going to a piece of cake,"" Johnson said.Everything important involves struggle, he said.""Heaven meant a lot so Jesus Christ had to struggle; he had to suffer,"" Johnson said. ""So if it means a lot to us, we're going to have to struggle, too. We're going to fall down at times. God's grace is going to be there to welcome us."""

While he would reveal his sentiments, he never seemed to let good relationships with his guests stand in the way of asking and framing his questions in a manner that would not allow the interviewee to duck or tap-dance around an actual answer. His follow-ups offered his depth of understanding of the issue and gave the impression that he didn't just hand off reading a guest's book or issue to a researcher or intern. He knew his stuff.John McCain was a regular guest with a seeming good relationship with Stewart. In a 2007 interview with the Republican senator from Arizona, however, Stewart revealed that he would not let friendship or satire get in the way of asking the tough questions.From the start, it was obvious that Stewart was not in the mood for trading tit-for-tat punch lines:""Do you want to start with 'Bomb, Bomb Iran' [McCain's ill-thought-out parody of the Beach Boys' song] or your 'market walk' [the senator's stroll through an Iraq marketplace, trying to illustrate how calm things were, while wearing body armor and surrounded by troops]?""It didn't make any difference which McCain chose. It was ""Did you stop beating your wife?"" to the max. But it was McCain who had baited his own trap. Stewart shot down every talking point as if he had been prepared for them. The interview drilled enough holes into McCain's stump speech that he might have thought twice about running.But the interview was not as much an insight into the thinness of McCain's arguments as much as what should have been a template for every real Sunday morning talk-show moderator.At the end of the emasculation, Stewart leaned over to his old friend - something he is wont to do at the end of every interview -- to whisper whatever it is he says. I don't know what McCain said back, but I'm sure it wasn't ""Can't wait to come back.""It is because of moments like this that I don't feel any sadness about Stewart's departure. I just give thanks that he gave us those 16 years.And for us fans, ""that's the way it was.""This post originally appeared in the author's Sunday Philadelphia Inquirer column.--Steve Young was the former political editor of National Lampoon and is the author  of Great Failures of the Extremely Successful (www.greatfailure.com)."

International attention will be focused in the coming days on the strategic railway hub of Debaltseve, where Ukrainian government forces have for weeks been fending off severe onslaughts from pro-Russian separatists. A cease-fire was declared in eastern Ukraine, kindling slender hopes of a reprieve from a conflict that has claimed more than 5,300 lives. (AP Photo/Petr David Josek)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc145442400003300229de0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Anton Zverev and Gleb GaranichDONETSK/ARTEMIVSK, Ukraine, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Ukraine's rebels disavowed a new truce on Sunday hours after it took effect, saying it did not apply to the town where most fighting has taken place in recent weeks.Guns fell abruptly silent at midnight across much of eastern Ukraine in line with the ceasefire agreement, but the pro-Russian rebels announced that they would not observe the truce at Debaltseve, where Ukraine army forces have been encircled.""Of course we can open fire (on Debaltseve). It is our territory,"" Eduard Basurin, a senior rebel commander, told Reuters.""The territory is internal: ours. And internal is internal. But along the line of confrontation there is no shooting.""Reuters journalists in nearby towns heard volleys of artillery from the direction of Debaltseve in the morning after a night that had been mostly quiet.Ukrainian forces have been holding out in the town for weeks, astride a railway junction in a pocket between the two main rebel strongholds.Washington says Russia's regular military, armed with tanks and missile launchers, carried out an operation in the days before the truce to encircle Debaltseve.Reuters journalists have seen armored columns of troops without insignia arriving in the area in recent days.Elsewhere in eastern Ukraine the ceasefire was met by abrupt silence at midnight. Reuters journalists in Donetsk, the main rebel stronghold, said artillery bombardment halted and they heard no firing overnight, after intense final hours before the ceasefire when shells had exploded every few seconds.A Reuters photographer in government-held territory also said constant bombardment had halted overnight, although he heard a volley of artillery around 7 a.m. from the direction of Debaltseve.The Ukrainian government said on Sunday morning that the ceasefire was being ""generally observed."" Its forces had been shelled 10 times in the hours since the truce took effect, but it described those incidents as ""localized"" rather than regular. Nine of its soldiers were killed on Saturday but none since the truce took effect, a spokesman said on Sunday morning.Hennadiy Moskal, the head of the Kiev-controlled administration for Luhansk, one of the rebellious provinces, said most hot spots had been quiet but a complete ceasefire had not come into effect.A Ukrainian staff officer stationed near Debaltseve said: ""The general level (of attacks) has decreased, although there are violations.""Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko, wearing the uniform of the armed forces supreme commander, said in a midnight televised address in the capital Kiev that he had ordered troops to stop firing in line with the truce.He said there was still alarm over the situation around Debaltseve.The ceasefire, negotiated in four-power talks on Thursday, foresees creation of a neutral buffer zone and withdrawal of heavy weapons. More than 5,000 people have been killed in a conflict that has caused the worst crisis in Russia-West relations since the Cold War. ""NEW RUSSIA""Russian President Vladimir Putin denies Moscow is involved in fighting for territory he calls ""New Russia."" Western officials cite overwhelming evidence to the contrary and Washington and its allies have imposed economic sanctions on Moscow.Poroshenko said that if Ukraine were slapped once, it would not offer the other cheek. But, seated alongside armed forces chief of staff Viktor Muzhenko, he added: ""I very much hope that the last chance to begin the long and difficult peaceful process for a political settlement will not be wasted.""In the hours leading up to the ceasefire, heavy artillery and rocket fire roughly every five seconds had reverberated across Donetsk, the main regional city in the east which is under the control of the secessionists.Ukrainian authorities said two civilians were killed by shells that hit a town minutes past midnight.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry urged implementation of the ceasefire in a telephone call with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov and expressed concern about efforts by Russia and the separatists to cut off Debaltseve.U.S. President Barack Obama expressed ""deep concern"" about the violence around Debaltseve prior to the ceasefire, in a telephone call with Poroshenko, the White House said. Obama also spoke to German chancellor Angela Merkel, who negotiated the ceasefire along with President Francois Hollande of France at all night talks with the leaders of Ukraine and Russia.The Kremlin said the four leaders who negotiated the truce would continue to speak by phone.Maxim, a rebel fighter at a checkpoint on a road from Donetsk to government-held Dnipropetrovsk, told Reuters it was indeed quiet but he did not expect the ceasefire to hold.""Truce? I doubt it. Maybe 2-3 days and then they will start shooting again. This is all for show. The OSCE is driving around here, so of course they are being quiet,"" he said. The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe has monitors to observe the truce.The U.S. State Department, pressing its case that Russia was backing the rebels in the latest fighting, on Saturday released commercial photographs that spokeswoman Jen Psaki said showed ""the Russian military has deployed large amounts of artillery and multiple rocket launchers around Debaltseve, where it is shelling Ukrainian positions.""""We are confident that these are Russian military, not separatist systems,"" she said.

It can bring communities together. It can ensure a top-notch workforce for our economy and an engaged citizenry for our democracy. We have an opportunity with the ESEA reauthorization to help reclaim the promise of public education.,2015-02-15,Elementary school students with their hands raised to ask a questions.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5babe5421f00002501227853.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A high-quality public education can build much-needed skills and knowledge. It can help children reach their God-given potential. It can stabilize communities and democracies. It can strengthen economies. It can combat the kind of fear and despair that evolves into hatred.On my recent visit to Israel, the West Bank and Auschwitz, I was reminded how public education, by bringing children together -- regardless of race, religion or creed -- can promote pluralism.Public education can also provide the safe harbors our children need, especially in tough times. In December in Ferguson, Mo., I saw how public schools gave kids the space they needed to process what was happening in their community, while instilling hope for their future.And we are all constantly reminded of how a high-quality public education, one that enables kids to learn teamwork, critical thinking and problem solving -- skills they need to compete in the 21st century -- can lead to good jobs and a more robust economy.Just last week, a new study was published that found if we eliminate the achievement gap in the United States, we can grow our gross domestic product by 10 percent and raise the lifetime earnings of low-wage workers by 22 percent. This study by the Washington Center for Equitable Growth describes strategies that have worked in other countries to bridge the achievement gap.We narrow that gap through supporting, not sanctioning, kids, teachers and schools. We narrow that gap through teaching kids how to work with their hands, to work in teams, to solve problems -- not just how to ace a test. We narrow that gap by providing early childhood education and helping all third-graders read at grade level. We narrow that gap when we give all kids, not just kids from wealthier families, access to art and music, librarians and nurses. We narrow that gap by focusing on high-poverty schools that struggle and helping these schools through interventions like wraparound services that combat the impact of poverty.There's a debate stirring now around the reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, a law signed by President Lyndon B. Johnson as part of his War on Poverty that, at its root, was about leveling the playing field for kids. The law's most recent iteration, No Child Left Behind, in emphasizing testing, pulled us away from the focus on kids, especially those who are poor--as are half of public school students in the United States.The good news is that pretty much everyone agrees NCLB has to go. The law allowed high-stakes testing to eclipse all else, it failed to close the achievement gap or reach its intended goals, and it must be fixed. More than 18,000 members of the American Federation of Teachers submitted comments on how to fix NCLB.One teacher talked about the number of pre- and post-tests her students take. She noted that even third-graders attend a Saturday Test-Prep Academy to learn test-taking skills. Her plea? ""We need thinkers, not test takers, for our future growth as a nation.""But even more compelling are stories that reveal the inequities that persist in America's classrooms. A teacher from Florida wrote simply, ""I work every day to support learning and high expectations for students who are hungry, are homeless, have experienced trauma, and struggle in many ways. ... Please, authorize ESEA in a way that provides for the needs of all students, whether they live in an affluent neighborhood, or in my school's neighborhood.""The current House Republican bill does just the opposite. While it would make some needed improvements to accountability, it would also lock in recession-driven cuts to education. It would allow state and local governments to walk away from their responsibility to maintain funding from year to year. And it would divert money meant to go to public schools that teach poor kids and give it to better-off schools. A report released this week from the White House found that this bill would cap ""spending for the next six years at $800 million lower than it was in 2012."" This would happen at a time when child poverty rates are alarmingly high and when Title I -- the biggest federal education program -- has failed to see any increase since 2012. The report also found that high-poverty districts could lose $700 million, while more-affluent districts could gain $470 million.Make no mistake: The House bill will further harm our most disadvantaged kids. We need a law that gives kids the resources they need, including computers, lower class sizes, nurses and counselors, even when their communities can't afford them. A high-quality public education can unlock our children's potential. It can bring communities together. It can ensure a top-notch workforce for our economy and an engaged citizenry for our democracy. We have an opportunity with the ESEA reauthorization to help reclaim the promise of public education. Now, let's work across the aisle to reclaim it."

A day after appointing twenty new cardinals from around the world, Pope Francis presided over Mass in St Peter's Basilica to offer thanks to God. (Photo by Franco Origlia/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7fb1d1f00000002252d94.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"VATICAN CITY (RNS) In a powerful sermon that signaled his desire to push ahead with historic reforms, Pope Francis on Sunday (Feb. 15) said the Roman Catholic Church must be open and welcoming, whatever the costs.He also warned the hierarchy not to be “a closed caste” but to lead in reaching out to all who are rejected by society and the church.“There are two ways of thinking and of having faith: we can fear to lose the saved and we can want to save the lost,” Francis told hundreds of cardinals and bishops arrayed before him in St. Peter’s Basilica at a Mass centered on the story of Jesus healing a leper rather than rejecting him.“Even today it can happen that we stand at the crossroads of these two ways of thinking,” the pope said as he outlined the current debate in the church between those seen as doctrinal legalists and those, like Francis, who want a more pastoral approach.“Jesus responds immediately to the leper’s plea, without waiting to study the situation and all its possible consequences,” Francis declared. “For Jesus, what matters above all is reaching out to save those far off, healing the wounds of the sick, restoring everyone to God’s family. And this is scandalous to some people!”“Jesus is not afraid of this kind of scandal,” the pontiff continued. “He does not think of the close-minded who are scandalized even by a work of healing, scandalized before any kind of openness, by any action outside of their mental and spiritual boxes, by any caress or sign of tenderness which does not fit into their usual thinking and their ritual purity.”Since his election almost two years ago, Francis has pushed the church to focus less on denouncing the sins of others — especially on issues of sexual morality — and to instead to reach out more to the poor and social outcasts.He also wants the church, especially the leadership, to reform itself, and he has convened a series of high-level summits at the Vatican to discuss overhauling the Vatican bureaucracy and changing church practices to, for example, enable divorced and remarried Catholics to receive Communion.But there was a sense at meetings in the Vatican over the past week that the momentum for change may be slowing — in part due to resistance from doctrinal conservatives and the Vatican’s old guard — and could use a jump-start.Francis seemed to provide such a jolt on Sunday in remarks that were “truly foundational,” in the words of the Rev. Antonio Spadaro, an Italian Jesuit who is close to the pope.The Rev. Thomas Rosica, a Canadian priest who works with the Vatican communications office, tweeted that “more than anything I’ve heard from (the pope) today’s homily is his mission statement.”Throughout his 15-minute homily, Francis repeatedly slammed the “narrow and prejudiced mentality” of believers who cling to religious laws out of fear. They wind up rejecting the very people they should be ministering to, he said, which means anyone on the margins of society “who encounters discrimination.”“Total openness to serving others is our hallmark, it alone is our title of honor!” Francis said at the Mass to mark his appointment of 20 new cardinals on Saturday.“We will not find the Lord unless we truly accept the marginalized!” he concluded. “Truly the Gospel of the marginalized is where our credibility is at stake, where it is found, and where it is revealed.”The new cardinals had joined Francis and more than 150 other members of the College of Cardinals for talks over the past week on restructuring the dysfunctional papal bureaucracy known as the Roman Curia.But the background noise to those meetings, and in other, smaller meetings among the pope’s top advisers, was the ongoing and increasingly pointed arguments between those who want to slow or halt Francis’ drive for change and those who think the 78-year-old pontiff needs to act more decisively, and soon.Francis himself seemed to acknowledge the opposition, citing New Testament passages in which St. Peter (considered by Catholic tradition to be the first pope – was rebuked by other early church leaders for entering the house of a pagan, and when St. Paul faced criticism for not requiring Christian converts to observe all aspects of Jewish law.“Charity is creative in finding the right words to speak to all those considered incurable and hence untouchable,” Francis said. “Contact is the true language of communication.”Francis said this mission applied to anyone in today’s world who is pushed aside “for whatever reason.”But he also listed specific examples, saying the cardinals should see “the crucified Lord” in the hungry and the unemployed, those who are in prison and “even in those who have lost their faith, or declared themselves to be atheists, or turned away from the practice of the faith.”"

""I promise you: Greece will then, in six months' time, be a completely different country.""The Eurogroup of finance ministers meets in Brussels on Monday to try to find common ground with Tsipras' new leftist government, elected on a pledge to scrap the austerity strictures of Greece's international bailouts, on issues such as debt management, financing, privatization and labor reform.If the meeting produces no results, there is a concern that Greece will be headed for a credit crunch that would force it out of the euro zone. Progress, however, could mean further negotiations, perhaps later in the week.""The irresistible force will be meeting the immovable object,"" Vasileios Gkionakis, head of global FX strategy at UniCredit, wrote in a note.European Central Bank President Mario Draghi refused to discuss the possibility of Greece leaving the euro zone if an agreement with European Union/International Monetary Fund lenders fell apart as a result of Greece's demands to alleviate its debt burden. He simply reiterated the euro zone's founding position that membership is ""irreversible."" BRIDGE PROGRAM?Tsipras wants a bridge program to be put in place for a few months while a new deal is agreed to replace the bailout, which has already forced drastic cutbacks onto ordinary Greeks.The rest of the euro zone, particularly Germany, says Greece must continue with those commitments as a quid pro quo for the 280 billion euros ($320 billion) it has received in bailouts.Slovak Finance Minister Peter Kazmir, whose country is said to be taking a tough line, tweeted that he was skeptical whether all details could be agreed on Monday.Greece's current bailout expires at the end of the month. A Eurogroup meeting last week ended without apparent progress although technical talks were later approved.Greek government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis showed no sign that Greece was easing back on its core demand.""The Greek government is determined to stick to its commitment towards the public ... and not continue a program that has the characteristics of the previous bailout agreement,"" he told Greece's Skai television.""What we have agreed on is that there is a need for a national reform plan, which European partners are listening closely to, and positively to tackle steady problems in Greece's economy and society that date back decades.""Some of the problems facing the Eurogroup are semantic. The Greeks, for example, will not countenance anything that smacks of an ""extension"" to the old bailout, preferring something new called a ""bridge"" agreement. WAVE OF ANGERThis is political. Tsipras rode into power on a wave of anti-austerity and anti-bailout anger last month and would have a hard time explaining a row-back so soon. Thousands of Greeks massed outside parliament in Athens on Sunday to back his strategy.But even a cosmetic change of labels could have practical consequences. An ""extension"" may not require many national ratifications unless it involves additional financial commitments from euro zone governments.But any new bailout program might require several national parliamentary ratifications and could also bring Germany's Constitutional Court into play.Among those requiring a parliamentary vote on a new bailout are Germany, Slovakia, Estonia and Finland, all identified by one veteran of EU meetings as part of a hard core of opponents to Greece's plan.The Eurogroup's main debate with Greece's ""no-austerity"" stance will revolve around the funding of a bridge program, Greece's request to reduce the 'primary' budget surpluses, excluding interest payments, that it is required to reach, and privatizations and labor reform.Greece said on Saturday that it was reviewing a 1.2 billion euro deal for Germany's Fraport to run 14 regional airports, one of the biggest privatization deals since Greece's debt crisis began in 2009. It has also pulled the plug on the privatization of the ports of Piraeus and Thessaloniki.On the question of liberalizing labor markets, government spokesman Sakellaridis remained tough:""We will discuss it with workers and with pensioners. Whatever we do we will do through dialog. We will not legislate at the sole behest of outside factors.""

They limit flying speed to 100 miles per hour (160 kph) and the altitude to 500 feet (152 meters) above ground level.The rules also say pilots must remain in the line of sight of its radio-control drone, which could limit inspection of pipelines, crops, and electrical towers that are one of the major uses envisioned by companies.The FAA acknowledged the limitation but said those flights could be made possible with a secondary spotter working with the pilot of the drone.""This rule does not deal with beyond line of sight, but does allow for the use of a visual observer to augment line of sight by the operator of the unmanned aircraft,"" FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a conference call with reporters on Sunday.The draft rules, nearly 10 years in the making, still must undergo public comment and revision before becoming final, a process expected to take at least a year.If they survive in their current form, they would be unlikely to help Amazon.com in its quest to eventually deliver packages with unmanned drones, since they require an FAA-certified small drone pilot to fly the aircraft and keep it in line of sight at all times - factors not envisioned in the online retailer's plan.Huerta also said, ""We don't consider or contemplate in this rule carrying packages outside of the aircraft itself.""Amazon's vice president of global public policy, Paul Misener, said the proposal would bar the company's delivery drones in the United States. Misener also urged the FAA to address the needs of Amazon and its customers as it carried out its formal rulemaking process.""We are committed to realizing our vision ... and are prepared to deploy where we have the regulatory support we need,"" Misener said in an emailed statement.Other countries have taken a more permissive stance towards delivery drones. In September, logistics firm DHL said its use of drones to drop off packages to residents of a German island was the first such authorized flight in Europe.""The United States cannot afford to lag behind other countries in technological innovation because of regulatory foot-dragging,"" U.S. Senator Cory Booker, a New Jersey Democrat, said in an emailed statement. RULES EXPECTED TO EVOLVEHuerta, who said the agency had tried to be ""flexible"" in writing the rules, said they set a framework and would evolve based on discussions with industry and technology developments.The rules continue current restrictions against filming of crowds by news organizations, but Huerta said he expected those procedures to be developed as part of discussions with news groups.Separately, President Barack Obama issued a memo outlining principles for government use of drones, covering such issues as privacy protections and oversight of federal drone use.The FAA's draft rules appeared less onerous in some aspects than the industry had been worried about. There had been concern, for example, that they would require drone operators to attend a flight-training school and obtain a certification similar to that of a manned aircraft pilot.Commercial drone operators would need to be at least 17 years old, pass an aeronautical knowledge test and be vetted by the Transportation Security Administration. But they would not need to undergo the medical tests or flight hours required of manned aircraft pilots.""I am very pleased to see a much more reasonable approach to future regulation than many feared,"" said Brendan Schulman, a lawyer who works on drone issues at Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel in New York.The proposal would benefit U.S. farmers and ranchers as it would enable them to scout fields more efficiently, said R.J. Karney, director of Congressional relations at the American Farm Bureau Federation.The Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International (AUVSI), also praised the draft. The group's president, Brian Wynne, called it a ""good first step in an evolutionary process.""But privacy advocates were concerned there were not enough limits on when law enforcement agencies would be permitted to use drones for surveillance.The proposal ""allows the use of data gathered by domestic drones for any 'authorized purpose', which is not defined, leaving the door open to inappropriate drone use by federal agencies,"" said Neema Singh Guliani, legislative counsel at the Washington legislative office of the American Civil Liberties Union, in an emailed statement.

Ocalan was captured by Turkish undercover agents in Kenya in 1999, brought back to Turkey and sentenced to death. His sentence was later commuted to life.

But some also say that unrest in the southeast suggests the PKK is flexing its muscles as it looks to stamp its authority on the mainly Kurdish region.Four months after deadly riots provoked by Kurdish anger at Ankara's reluctance to help defend their kin in Syria, fresh unrest broke out in the town of Cizre near the Syrian and Iraqi frontiers between security forces, PKK supporters and Kurdish Islamists. At least six people were killed during the riots last month.Those involved in talks remain tight-lipped on details, fearful of undermining prospects for a final deal. Kurds have been pushing for Ocalan's release, an amnesty for fighters and steps towards autonomy.""The Kurdistan freedom struggle will from now on aim for the freedom of leader Apo (Abdullah Ocalan). We will step up the struggle for a free Kurdistan,"" PKK-linked political umbrella group KCK said in a statement on Sunday.Ankara's hopes of a complete end to the PKK as an armed group have been frustrated by the role it has carved out for itself fighting in Syria and Iraq against Islamic State.On Saturday night and Sunday, demonstrators and police fought in streets in Sirnak and Diyarbakir, the main city in Turkey's predominantly Kurdish southeast.Shops kept their shutters lowered in a sign of protest and thousands took to the streets holding up recent photographs of their jailed leader. Police detained 17 protesters in Sirnak.""Long live leader Ocalan,"" protesters chanted.The Turkish government launched talks with Ocalan in 2012. The PKK, which is designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union, subsequently declared a ceasefire and began withdrawing from Turkey to camps in northern Iraq where they are based.Turkish Prime Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said on Saturday the peace process had reached a critical stage and that he expected ""a beautiful spring"" if the arms were silenced.""Arms should totally leave Turkey's agenda. Then, beautiful steps will be taken and the country will go through an atmosphere of spring,"" he said. (Writing by Ece Toksabay; Editing by Stephen Powell)"

They are now fighting back in a regional effort to crush the militant group.The insurgency has also cast doubt on the leadership of President Goodluck Jonathan, who is seen as not having done enough to contain it or protect civilians, hundreds of whom have been kidnapped, including scores of schoolgirls.Nigeria last weekend postponed for six weeks national election set for Feb. 14, citing the security threat from Boko Haram in a move that rattled markets and foreign investors.Jonathan's rival in the election now rescheduled for March 28, former military ruler Muhammadu Buhari, is seen as the tougher of the two on the security issue, having quelled an Islamist uprising in the 1980s.Before the Gombe attack the militants warned people not to participate in the elections or risk being killed, according to a leaflet obtained by Reuters from a local resident.Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau has said repeatedly that democracy is un-Islamic.

Police officials were not available for comment.French ambassador Francois Zimeray attended the cafe event and praised Denmark's support for freedom of speech following the January attack in Paris on the Charlie Hebdo newspaper that killed a dozen people.Witnesses said that the envoy had barely finished an introduction to the meeting when up to 40 shots rang out, outside the venue, as an attacker tried to shoot inside.Police said they considered Vilks, the main speaker, to have been the target. A 55-year-old man died as a result of that shooting, police said early on Sunday.""We feel certain now that it was a politically motivated attack, and thereby it was a terrorist attack,"" Prime Minister Helle Thorning-Schmidt told journalists, speaking on Saturday close to the site of the cafe.Hours later, during the night, shots were fired at a synagogue in another part of the city, about a half hour walk away from the cafe. A man was shot in the head, and was later confirmed to have died. Two police officers were wounded. ""GET OUT""In Paris on Jan. 17, brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi burst into the office of the Charlie Hebdo newspaper and opened fire in revenge for its satirical images of the Prophet Mohammad.In all, 17 people were killed over three days of violence in France.European Council President Donald Tusk called Saturday's attack ""another brutal terrorist attack targeted at our fundamental values and freedoms, including the freedom of expression.""Helle Merete Brix, organizer of the event at the cafe, told Reuters she had seen an attacker wearing a mask.""The security guards shouted 'Everyone get out!' and we were being pushed out of the room,"" Brix said.""They tried to shoot their way into the conference room ... I saw one of them running by, wearing a mask. There was no way to tell his face.""Denmark itself became a target after the publication 10 years ago of cartoons lampooning the Prophet Mohammad, images which led to sometimes fatal protests in the Muslim world.Many Muslims consider any representation of the Prophet Mohammad blasphemous.Vilks stirred controversy himself in 2007 with his drawings depicting Mohammad as a dog, triggering numerous death threats.He has lived under the protection of Swedish police since 2010. Two years ago, an American woman was sentenced to 10 years in prison in the United States for plotting to kill him.French President Francois Hollande said Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve would go to the Danish capital later on Sunday.

Shi'ite Muslim Houthi fighters have sidelined the central government after seizing the capital Sanaa in September and expanding across Yemen, which borders oil giant Saudi Arabia.Al Qaeda and other Sunni Muslim militants have since stepped up attacks. Yemen is home to Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, one of the global network's most active arms, which has carried out attacks abroad.The 15-nation Security Council is set to adopt a British- and Jordanian-drafted resolution later on Sunday, diplomats said.The Gulf Cooperation Council, a six-nation bloc comprising energy-rich Gulf states, had urged the Security Council to adopt a resolution under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, which allows decisions to be enforced with economic sanctions or force. The draft U.N. resolution set to be approved is not under Chapter 7. The draft text, obtained by Reuters, declares the council's readiness to take ""further steps"" if the resolution is not implemented by parties in Yemen. In November, the council imposed sanctions on Yemen's former president, Ali Abdullah Saleh, and two Houthi leaders.The text ""deplores actions taken by the Houthis to dissolve parliament and take over Yemen's government institutions, including acts of violence."" DEMAND FOR NEGOTIATIONSIt demands the Houthis engage in good faith in U.N.-brokered negotiations on a political settlement, withdraw their forces from government institutions, release Yemen's president, prime minister and other cabinet members from house arrest and stop undermining the political transition and the security of Yemen.The Houthis started off as a revivalist group for Yemen's Zaydi Shi'ite Muslim sect in the north of the country, before morphing over the past decade into a revolutionary movement with national ambitions, and an ally of Iran.The draft resolution ""calls on all member states to refrain from external interference which seeks to foment conflict and instability and instead to support the political transition.""The text ""demands that all parties in Yemen, cease all armed hostilities against the people and the legitimate authorities of Yemen and relinquish the arms seized from Yemen's military and security institutions.""Tens of thousands of Yemenis demonstrated in several cities on Saturday against the rule of the Houthi movement as clashes between Houthis and Sunnis in a southern mountainous region left 26 dead.The draft text calls on all parties to ensure the security of diplomats and diplomatic premises.

""If it hadn't been for that march across Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody Sunday, there would be no Barack Obama as president of the United States of America,"" he said.On March 7, 1965, Lewis, then the chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, led about 600 protesters across the bridge before they were stopped by police. Minutes after officers told the demonstrators to disperse, they attacked Lewis and the protesters with tear gas, bullwhips and clubs.Obama will visit Selma next month to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act, which eliminated many of the tactics that were disenfranchising black voters.Despite the progress since Bloody Sunday, Lewis said that the country still had more work to do on race relations. He said that the country had let the tensions surrounding the protests in Ferguson, Missouri, after the death of Michael Brown -- an unarmed black teen fatally shot by a police officer -- ""drift away."" If the country passes on confronting the complex racial issues raised by Ferguson, Lewis said, there will be similar incidents in the future.""We can make progress, we can deal with the issue of justice, we can deal with the issue of police and communities,"" he said. ""You bring communities and law enforcement and not sweep the issues under the rug."" Lewis added that FBI Director James Comey made a  ""profound statement"" last Thursday when he acknowledged that law enforcement officers carried racial biases.Even with those challenges, Lewis said that he still thought the United States could achieve a colorblind society.""Sometimes I feel like crying, tears of happiness, tears of joy, to see the distance we've come and the progress we've made,"" Lewis said. ""When people tell me nothing has changed, I just feel like saying, 'Come and walk in my shoes. I will show you. I will take you to those places.'""CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that 2015 was the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. It is the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act."
