But nobody seemed to be buying it. Only leading 2-0 with two outs in the fifth inning, Blue Jays outfielder Colby Rasmus beat Texas' defensive shift with a bunt single down the third base line. That's just a smart play by Rasmus, right? Not to Lewis. After failing to throw him out at first, the nine-year veteran shouted something at Rasmus. ""I told [Rasmus] I didn't appreciate it. You're up by two runs with two outs and you lay down a bunt. I don't think that's the way the game should be played,"" Lewis explained, via MLB.com. Not only did Lewis feel like Rasmus showed bad baseball etiquette, he thought it was a selfish play as well. ""I felt like you have a situation where there is two outs, you're up two runs, you have gotten a hit earlier in the game off me, we are playing the shift, and he laid down a bunt basically simply for average. [Rasmus] didn't steal within the first two pitches to put himself in scoring position. That tells me he is solely looking out for himself, and looking out for batting average. And I didn't appreciate it.""Click here to watch the play. Rasmus seemed confused by Lewis' frustration, saying he ""didn't do anything out of the unwritten rules of baseball"" and he ""felt like that's what I should do to help my team."" Rasmus wasn't the only one who didn't understand what Lewis was complaining about. Close your eyes, and this reads like an Onion story.

Rock hard abs in a matter of days, liquid meals that will make you drop pounds in a flash, or that J-Lo butt by next Wednesday. Lots of gimmicks play on the emotions of people who desperately want to lose weight -- and fast. It's human nature to want results quick. Who doesn't like efficiency and speed? That's why no one is a fan of getting stuck in a traffic jam, waiting in some endless line or pleading with your computer to get unstuck. We want to see progress, and we want it now, please. But here's your reality check: Quick fixes can lead to quick results that quickly vanish. If you want lasting change, it's time to let go of instant gratification BS and find a new way to live. You can love how you look and feel (permanently) by developing decent habits that become second nature to you. 1. Be who you are and do what you like. You know yourself better than anyone else. If you despise mornings, don't force yourself to go power walking before the sun comes up. If you admire someone who lives at the gym but you know that's not you, that's okay. Work with who you are. If the notion of jogging makes you want to stay in your pajamas eating peanut butter out of the jar, find an activity that appeals to you or (dare I say) that you look forward to. Dance, walk, hike, bike, rollerblade or go to a yoga class. You know you. I'm all about consistency, but if you don't find an activity you like and is convenient, you won't do it. Plan an activity you will actually do at a time when you will actually do it. Drop the word exercise and think of it as training. Training for a 5k, an upcoming tennis match, or maybe just training for a healthy life. Maybe that means you work out with a friend or have to make a new playlist that will inspire you to move. Just tap into what you know is doable for you. I'm a believer in having a motivator to keep you going, whether it's a workout buddy, a class that you regularly attend or your personal trainer. Whatever works for you. Soon, you will experience all the physical and mental rewards of regular movement, and exercise will just become a habit you don't want to miss. 2.  Think about eating, not dieting.  Forget diets forever. You don't have to try the soup diet or the grapefruit diet or the shake diet. For the rest of your life, you are going to need to eat, so wouldn't you prefer to have a better relationship with food? You don't have to feel deprived or focus on what you can't eat. Take those four letters D-I-E-T and rearrange them to spell E-D-I-T. Edit what you eat. Think about preparing and eating delicious meals that support your health most of the time. Think of food as fuel that your body needs to operate at its best. Nourish your body with your daily choices. Go for clean eating -- using fresh veggies and real ingredients you can pronounce. Eat fewer processed and packaged foods. I love the simplicity of Michael Pollan's quote: ""Eat food, not too much, mostly plants."" Get creative and make new recipes you've never tried before and eat healthier desserts. You can love food, be a foodie, enjoy delicious foods and still lose weight or stay in shape. If you need help with recipe ideas that embrace clean eating -- I've got you covered! 3. Give up shame and blame forever. Imagine that you make decisions about food and exercise and you never beat yourself up again. You allow yourself the occasional indulgence. You say ""that's okay"" to yourself when you miss a workout. You eat dessert and enjoy every bite. No giant helping of guilt to go on top of that piece of cheesecake for you. As I always say, you cannot make anything positive happen when you are experiencing negative emotion, so shift your mindset to the positive. If I choose to have a dish of ice cream, I recognize it's a treat and I enjoy it -- with a smile on my face and guilt-free. It's just a choice; the end of the world isn't coming. I promise. Run your habits through this filter: Make decisions that support your health the majority of the time. Just by accepting that you will do better (by your own standards) on some days more so than others, you can let go of food guilt. View each day as an opportunity to invest in your health with your decisions about food and exercise and drop the mental baggage. This is your one and only life, and I think you should love it. It doesn't matter what you weigh when you read this -- the best way to love how you look and feel is to love yourself throughout the process and develop decent habits and results that stick."
3,LATINO VOICES,Activists Ask New York Mayor To Stop Detaining Immigrants For ICE,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ice-free-nyc-letter_n_5600841.html,,2014-07-20,"NEW YORK, NY - JULY 18: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio speaks to the media at a news conference to address the recent death of a man in police custody on July 18, 2014 in New York City. The mayor has promised a full investigation into the circumstances surrounding the death of Eric Garner after he was taken into police custody in Staten Island yesterday. A 400-pound, 6-foot-4 asthmatic, Garner (43) died after police put him in a chokehold outside of a conveinence store for illegally selling cigarettes. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae9ef324000030009677c9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A group of immigrant rights activists called on New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, in an open letter published this week, to use his executive authority to keep the city’s police from detaining undocumented immigrants on behalf of the federal government. Dozens of police departments across the country have stopped complying with such requests, known as detainers, but New York City -- where more than one in three residents is an immigrant -- has yet to join them. The letter took issue with de Blasio administration’s continued cooperation with Secure Communities, a fingerprint-sharing system used to identify deportable undocumented immigrants. “The city’s collaboration with ICE programs like Secure Communities (S-Comm) invites racial profiling and discourages victims, including victims of police brutality, from exercising their rights,” the letter says. “This program never did and never will belong in New York City.” Immigrant rights groups have long pressed local governments to disregard ICE detainers, arguing that they undermine trust between the police and immigrant communities, and that they arbitrarily funnel undocumented immigrant into deportation proceedings. The letter, published by a coalition of organizations that includes the Black Alliance for Just Immigration, the Carwasheros, Families for Freedom and the Migrant Power Alliance, highlights that holding immigrants on ICE detainers goes beyond any problems with the law they may face. “It is important to note that a policy against ICE detainer requests does not release anyone into the community who is not otherwise eligible to be released,” the letter says. “Using the criminal justice system as a gateway for immigration enforcement is feeding off a system that is racially biased at every stage.” ICE holds are also expensive, the groups point out. A 2012 study found that taxpayers in Los Angeles doled out $26 million per year to cover the cost of ICE holds.But as of this month, however, Los Angeles no longer honors ICE holds without judicial review. Los Angeles joined the California cities of San Diego and San Francisco, which also decline to honor ICE detainers. Outside California, many jurisdictions, including the cities of Philadelphia and Las Vegas and the state of Rhode Island, have adopted similar policies. Under New York City’s previous mayor, Michael Bloomberg, the City Council twice passed laws limiting the city’s cooperation with ICE holds. The first law, in 2011, established guidelines under which to honor an ICE detainer. The bill was followed up last year with a law that further restricted cooperation with ICE. But activists say the reform didn’t go far enough. The law contains several exceptions, the New York Times reports, that allow the city to honor ICE detainer requests if the person in question has been convicted of a felony or is facing a felony charge, has outstanding deportation orders, or was included in a gang database or terrorism watchlist. The exceptions also include several misdemeanors. Between October 2012 and September 2013, New York City’s Department of Correction assented to 73 percent of ICE detainers, according to the New York Daily News. The de Blasio administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the letter. In May, de Blasio’s press office released a statement to the Daily News that said: The city has taken action to limit the impact of S-Comm in our immigrant communities through new detainer discretion laws that limit who is turned over to ICE when they are arrested for non-serious crimes. Mayor de Blasio is committed to enforcing those laws and ensuring that people are not put on the path to deportation for minor violations."

Israel's operation against Hamas saw one of its bloodiest days with 46 Palestinians killed in Gaza and two Israeli soldiers dying in a clash with militants who infiltrated the Jewish state. As Israeli warplanes bombarded Gaza from the air, and ground troops pressed an assault on land, the Palestinian death toll rose to 342, with rights groups warning that a growing number of victims are children.

Explosions rocked the coastal enclave overnight and shells fired by Israeli naval forces lit up the sky.Israeli tank shelling killed one Palestinian and hit houses in the northeastern Shejaia district, where residents called radio stations pleading for evacuation.An Israeli air strike there on the house of senior Hamas official Khalil al-Hayya killed his son and daughter-in-law and two children, hospital officials said. Near the southern town of Rafah shelling killed four Palestinians, health officials said.In Israel, sirens sounded in towns near Gaza, warning of approaching rockets.Israel sent ground forces into Hamas-dominated Gaza on Thursday after 10 days of heavy air and naval barrages failed to stop rocket fire, some of which reached deep into Israel, from the Palestinian territory.The military said in a statement on Sunday it had sent additional forces into the Palestinian enclave. Israel has vowed to destroy a network of tunnels out of Gaza and hunt down the militants' stockpiles of missiles.Gaza officials said at least 345 Palestinians, many of them civilians, have been killed in the 13-day conflict. On Israel's side, five soldiers and two civilians have died.Diplomatic efforts to secure a ceasefire involving, among others, Egypt, Qatar, France and the United Nations, have failed to make headway.Qatar was due to host a meeting between Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Sunday, a senior Qatari source told Reuters. Ban was due during the week to travel to Kuwait, Egypt, Israel, the Palestinian Territories and Jordan, a U.N. statement said.The Qatari source said Abbas was also due to meet Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal.Western-backed Abbas in April struck a deal with Islamist Hamas that led to the formation of a Palestinian unity government, seven years after the group seized control of Gaza from Abbas's Fatah party. FAILED EFFORTSHamas has rejected Egyptian efforts to end fighting, saying any deal must include an end to a blockade of the coastal area and a recommitment to a ceasefire reached after an eight-day war in Gaza in 2012.Egypt said on Saturday it had no plans to revise its ceasefire proposal. A Hamas source in Doha said the group has no plans to change its conditions for a ceasefire.Israel is wary of mediation by Qatar, which hosts a large number of exiled Islamists from across the Middle East including Meshaal, and Israeli officials have said Egypt must be a party to any ceasefire deal.French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, who flew to Israel after meetings in Egypt and Jordan, said on Saturday efforts to secure a ceasefire had failed.""On the contrary, there's a risk of more civilian casualties that worries us,"" Fabius said, after talks with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Tel Aviv.Hostilities between the two sides escalated following the killing last month of three Jewish students that Israel blames on Hamas. Hamas neither confirmed nor denied involvement.The apparent revenge murder of a Palestinian youth in Jerusalem, for which Israel has charged three Israelis, further fueled tension.Israeli bulldozers and engineers worked along a 1.5-km-wide (one-mile-wide) strip of Gaza's eastern frontier, uncovering 13 tunnels, at least one of them 30 meters (90 feet) deep, military spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Lerner said.About 95 rocket launchers were also found and destroyed in the sweep, he added.Searches were continuing in what he described as an open-ended mission that had ""severely impeded Hamas capabilities"".Israel says more than 1,700 rockets have been fired out of Gaza during this month's fighting, and between 3,000 and 4,000 destroyed in military strikes - together almost half of the militants' original estimated arsenal.Hamas says it is continuously replenishing its stock of weapons and is ready for a prolonged conflict.The Israeli death toll has been kept low due to the rockets' relative inaccuracy, a network of air raid sirens and shelters and the Iron Dome rocket interceptor's 90 percent success rate.The Israeli military urged Palestinians to flee a growing area of Gaza ahead of further military action in the Mediterranean enclave. Residents say about half of the territory's 1.8 million population have been told to move.With both the Israeli and Egyptian borders sealed off, Gazans say they have few places to escape to.The largest U.N. agency in Gaza, UNRWA, said about 61,500 people had sought refuge in its buildings, mainly schools - more than in any previous conflict there between Israel and Islamist militants.

The missile system used to shoot down a Malaysian airliner was handed to pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine by Moscow, the top US diplomat said Sunday. Outraged world leaders have demanded Russia's immediate cooperation in a prompt and independent probe into the shooting down on July 17 of flight MH17 with 298 people on board. AFP PHOTO/ BULENT KILIC (Photo credit should read BULENT KILIC/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13a952600005200709769.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Policymakers, especially policymakers who have never seen action, are often seduced by covert operations. They see them as the perfect policy instrument: cheap, deniable, effective. Yes, there can be tremendously effective covert or at least non-conventional operations and campaigns, but just as all intelligence operations must come to terms with the fundamental truth that nothing is guaranteed to stay secret for ever, so too these sneaky campaigns can very easily either fail or, even more likely, have unexpected consequences that may overshadow the intended outcome. After all, while al Qaeda and the rise of Osama bin Laden cannot entirely be charted back to the US campaign to support Islamist rebels fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan -- had the social, political and intellectual climate not been ready for the message of jihad then they would have remained on the fringes -- nonetheless there is a strong connection. Courtesy of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, Putin is now coming to terms with the blowback from his Ukrainian adventure, a hybrid non-linear political-military campaign fought largely through local proxies, and this is something that will dog him for as long as he is in power. I plan to look at these in more detail at a later date, but in summary, the consequences are:1. You don't have control over events on the ground but (rightly) get blamed when bad stuff happens. The MH17 shootdown is generating an unprecedented level of anger. Even if ultimately it is unable to muster the unity, determination and moral courage to act resolutely -- although I hope they do -- I do not believe the West will look at Putin the same way again. Furthermore, the pliant choir of ""useful idiots"" arguing the Russian case, whether out of self-interest or because of a naive and perverse disillusion with their own society, will find their lives harder and their audiences less tolerant.2. You inject yourself into the negotiations, but can't deliver on a deal. At this stage, Kiev will be looking for more from Moscow than ""we won't send any more people or weapons in to join the fight"" but it is questionable whether the Russians can do more than extract those elements of the rebellion which really are direct covert operatives and try to persuade the rest. Given that Moscow doesn't really care about the east Ukrainians but is instead using them to put pressure on Kiev, it is unlikely to put a great premium on looking after them and their interests -- but it must then sell them the consequent peace terms.3. You create chaos on your border. Even if Kiev is able to win a military victory or else is willing and able to arrange some kind of peace deal (which is all the harder now), eastern Ukraine will be suffering from the effects of this nasty conflict for years to come. Bad blood between communities, civilians angry at either the separatists or government after being caught in the crossfire, a hemorrhage of weapons which will arm gangsters, terrorists and random lunatics for years to come... considering the close ethnic and economic connections across the border, that will inevitably have an impact on Russia.4. You disappoint people you previously counted as fervent supporters. It's not just Strelkov who expressed disappointment at Russia's stance. There are already concerns within the ultra-nationalist wing in Russia, people who previously saw Putin as the ideal ruler, not least given his recent shift towards a messianic Russian exceptionalism and a commitment to asserting Russia's rights to protect Russians abroad. This is very much a fringe movement, and poses no serious threat to Putin, but it does mean that he no longer can rely on their active support.5. You undermine your persona as the infallible tsar. Of course the Russian media will spin whatever decision he chooses to make, but we shouldn't presume that the Russian population are wholly clueless. If he has to accept the crushing of the insurrection and, even more alarming, a further Ukrainian drift towards Europe without having been given some grounds to claim""Mission Accomplished,"" then he will look bad. (To that end, if the aim is an early end to hostilities, it would make sense for Kiev to ponder what face-saving package it can give that it is willing to give: simply a nicely package assertion of things already said, such as the protection of Russia's status as a state language; as well as what is a practical inevitability, such as ruling out NATO membership for at least eight years, might be enough.)6. You look weak before your other neighbors, undermining claims to regional hegemony. Just as the 2008 Georgian War was as much -- if not mainly -- about asserting Moscow's will and capacity to punish those Near Abroad states challenging its regional hegemony, a perceived failure in Ukraine cannot but embolden those other nations. Let's face it, Moscow has in the main relatively little positive soft power: no one especially likes Russia or looks up to it as a model. Instead, there are some countries who regard it as either too useful or too dangerous to flout. That pragmatic arithmetic may shift.7. You are held accountable for your actions (maybe). We'll have to see quite how robust the further Western response will be. The current sanctions regime and diplomatic chill is a little irksome but entirely bearable, but if we start seeing more concrete measures, whether the cancellation of contracts (can Paris really still deliver modern assault carriers to Russia with good conscience?), expanded travel bans or even sectoral sanctions, then this will hit Russia and Russians. Short-term bravado will give way to longer-term concerns in this case. Either way, those voices in the West who warned that Putin's Russia was that dangerous thing, a compound of the aggressive and erratic, have been proven right, and NATO now looks more relevant than at any time since not even 1991, but arguably since Gorbachev's accession to power.One way or the other, while the concept of non-linear war is still entirely valid and will be a crucial factor in 21st century statecraft, in this case it has gone very wrong. Bad luck for Moscow, to a degree, but handing powerful weapons to undertrained, undisciplined and gung-ho rebels is in many ways an invitation to such bad luck. And ultimately Putin has no one to blame but himself (although I'm sure he'll find someone.)Mark Galeotti is Professor of Global Affairs at New York University's Center for Global Affairs, where his focus is modern Russian history and security affairs and transnational and organized crime.

Israeli television stations ignored the report in their extended evening programming about the offensive.""Qassam Brigades captured a Zionist soldier,"" said Abu Ubaida, the masked spokesman of the Izz el-Deen al-Qassam Brigades, the armed wing of Hamas, who identified the soldier as Shaul Aron and recited what he said was Aron's identity tag number.He provided no other evidence the soldier was in the custody of the Islamist militants.Ubaida said the capture happened during the same battle in which 13 Israeli soldiers died earlier, near Shejaia, the embattled neighborhood east of the city of Gaza where most of the Palestinian casualties occurred on Sunday.The one-day death toll was the highest for the Israeli military's since a 2006 war against Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon. It also represented the most Palestinians killed since fighting began on July 8.Aron would be the first Israeli soldier held captive in Gaza since 2011, when Israel released about 1,000 Palestinian prisoners to free Gilad Shalit, a soldier who was held for more than five years after his 2006 capture in a cross-border raid.Cries of celebration and fireworks were heard around Gaza shortly after the Hamas broadcast on Sunday.Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas accused Israel of carrying out a massacre in Shejaia and declared three days of mourning.Israel's army said it had been targeting militants from Gaza's dominant Hamas group, whom it alleged had fired rockets from Shejaia and built tunnels and command centers there. The army said it had warned locals two days earlier to leave.Army sources said seven of the 13 Israeli soldiers were in an armored personnel carrier hit by anti-tank fire. Others were killed setting up positions inside houses they had taken over, the sources added.Residents fled Sunday's fighting along streets strewn with bodies and rubble, many of them taking shelter in Gaza's Shifa hospital.Cries of ""Did you see Ahmed?"" ""Did you see my wife?"" echoed through the courtyard. Inside, dead and wounded lay on blood-stained floors.HEAVY CIVILIAN CASUALTIESThe Shifa hospital director, Naser Tattar, said 17 children, 14 women and four elderly were among 62 Palestinians killed, and about 400 people were wounded in the Israeli assault.Gaza's Health Ministry said 37 other Palestinians were also killed on Sunday, bringing the Gaza death toll since an Israeli air and naval bombardments began on July 8 to 434, many of them civilians. Some 2,600 Palestinians have been wounded, it said.Eighteen Israeli soldiers and two Israeli civilians have been killed since the launch of the offensive, which expanded on Thursday into a ground push, following mounting cross-border rocket attacks by militants.Palestinian fighters kept up their rocket fire on Israel on Sunday. Sirens sounded in southern Israeli towns and in the Tel Aviv metropolitan area. There were no reports of casualties from those salvos.In a telephone conversation with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - their second in three days - U.S. President Barack Obama ""raised serious concern about the growing number of casualties"" on both sides of the conflict, the White House said.Netanyahu, addressing a news conference in Tel Aviv after the military released news of the soldiers' deaths, pledged to press on with the campaign with the goals of ""restoring quiet"" while ""significantly"" damaging Hamas and other militant groups' infrastructure in Gaza.""We are undeterred. We shall continue the operation as long as is required,"" Netanyahu said.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will travel to Cairo on Monday to meet with Egyptian officials about the crisis, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said in a statement, adding that the United States was deeply concerned about the risk of further escalation and was pushing for a ceasefire.Earlier on Sunday, Kerry said he supported Israel's efforts to destroy tunnels it says Gaza militants use for infiltration attempts and to hide weaponry.""We support Israel's right to defend itself against rockets that are continuing to come in,"" Kerry told Fox News.Thousands streamed out of Shejaia, some by foot and others piling into the backs of trucks and sitting on the hoods of cars filled with families trying to get away. Several people rode out of the neighborhood in the shovel of a bulldozer.Video given to Reuters by a local showed at least a dozen corpses, including three children, lying in streets, though the footage could not be verified independently.As the tank shells began to land, Shejaia residents called radio stations pleading for evacuation. An air strike on the Shejaia home of Khalil al-Hayya, a senior Hamas official, killed his son, daughter-in-law and two grandchildren, hospital officials said.Hamas's armed wing said it used landmines and roadside bombs against advancing Israeli tanks and armored personnel carriers.""As we moved into Shejaia we were met by anti-tank missiles, RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades), heavy, extensive weapons fire at the forces from the houses, from the surrounding buildings,"" said Lieutenant-Colonel Peter Lerner, an Israeli military spokesman.Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said some of the Israeli firepower was unleashed to try to extricate soldiers who had come under attack.The Israeli military said it beefed up its presence on Sunday, with a focus on destroying missile stockpiles and the vast tunnel system Hamas built along the frontier with Israel.""I estimate that within two or three days the major part of the tunnels will have been destroyed,"" Yaalon said at the news conference where Netanyahu also spoke.'HUMAN SHIELDS'Netanyahu has accused Hamas of using non-combatants as human shields, and he told CNN the army was concentrating on military targets.""All civilian casualties are unintended by us, but actually intended by Hamas. They want to pile up as many civilian dead as they can ... it's gruesome,"" Netanyahu said. ""They use telegenically-dead Palestinians for their cause. They want the more dead the better.""The U.N. Relief and Works Agency said that 81,000 displaced people had now taken refuge in 61 UNRWA shelters in Gaza.Egypt, Qatar, France and the United Nations, among others, have all been pushing, with little sign of progress, for a permanent ceasefire in the worst surge of Israeli-Palestinian fighting in two years.Qatar was due to host a meeting between Abbas and U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Sunday, a senior Qatari source told Reuters.Speaking in Doha, Ban described the fighting in Gaza as an ""open wound and we must stop the bleeding now."" He was due to travel to Kuwait, Egypt, Israel, the Palestinian Territories and Jordan during the week, a U.N. statement said.The Qatari source said Abbas would also meet Hamas leader Khaled Meshaal.The Western-backed Abbas in April struck a reconciliation deal with Hamas, which seized the Gaza Strip in 2007 from forces loyal to his Fatah movement. The agreement led to the formation of a Palestinian unity government and Israel's pullout from U.S.-brokered peace talks.Hamas has already rejected one Egyptian-brokered truce, saying any deal must include an end to a blockade of the coastal area and a recommitment to a ceasefire reached after an eight-day war in Gaza in 2012.Hostilities escalated following the killing last month of three Jewish students that Israel blames on Hamas. Hamas neither confirmed nor denied involvement.The apparent revenge murder of a Palestinian youth in Jerusalem, for which Israel has charged three Israelis, further fueled tension.

He challenged Europe’s leaders to stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin in the wake of the crash of the Malaysian airliner in eastern Ukraine, which US and Ukrainian intelligence believe was shot down by Russian-supplied surface to air missiles.“My sense is that the European public opinion is aroused,” Brzezinski told Zakaria. “This humanitarian issue is so tragic, so painful, so cruel and so unnecessary that the Europeans are beginning to be moved. But each of the major European leaders has a role to play. Chancellor Merkel has to face the fact that her predecessor, also a chancellor, was one of the creators of Europe's dependence on Russian energy supplies. Does Europe want to become a satellite? I think President Hollande has to face the fact that he cannot now, at this moment, be sending advanced arms to help Russia. Prime Minister Cameron should face the fact that the city of London has become a Las Vegas for Russian financial transactions that are self-serving. There are responsibilities these leaders have to face and they have public opinions which I think are becoming increasingly aware that this is truly a moment of decisive significance for the future of the system -- of the world system.” Asked whether a new Cold War between the West and Russia was in the offing, Brzezinski responded “We're not starting the Cold War. He (Putin) has started it. But he has gotten himself into a horrendous jam. I strongly suspect that a lot of people in Russia, even not far away from him who are worried that Russia's status in the world is dramatically being undermined, that Russia's economically beginning to fail, that Russia's threatened by the prospect of becoming a satellite to China, that Russia's becoming self-isolated and discredited.” "

Andy Harris, R-Md., speaks at a news conference outside the US Capitol in Washington. As immigration advocates swarm the country trying to persuade House Republicans to pass a comprehensive immigration overhaul, Harris held a town hall meeting this August northeast of Baltimore, Md., with an overflow crowd who booed loudly when an audience member asked him to support a path to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Harris shot the idea down calling it a ""nonstarter"" that's ""not going anywhere fast"" in the House. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d013240000500057710d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- If there's one thing Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.) wants you to know about his crusade to block the District of Columbia's marijuana decriminalization statute -- which officially went into effect on Thursday -- it's this: He's doing it for the kids. ""There is no question in anyone's mind, nor should there be, that teenage drug use will go up due to D.C. decriminalization laws,"" Harris said on Bill Bennett's radio show this week.In fact, studies show that scholars are not nearly so unequivocal on the question of whether decriminalization or similar laws lead to more teenagers using the drug.A spokeswoman for Harris referred The Huffington Post to a statement from the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry opposing decriminalization, which the group warns is ""likely to be associated with"" increased teen pot use. But other researchers have concluded that fewer legal barriers to marijuana use -- either through the legalization of medical marijuana or the lowering of penalties for pot possession -- do not cause the young to flock to the drug at higher rates. A report from the Institute for the Study of Labor found that over the years 1993 to 2011, teen marijuana use actually dropped in states that legalized medical marijuana.That report also noted that only two previous studies had looked at teen use following the legalization of medical marijuana: One found a slight increase; the other found a decrease.Furthermore, when all drugs were decriminalized in Portugal in 2001, drug use decreased among teenagers, according to a Cato Institute analysis by Glenn Greenwald. Under Portugal's new system, the rate of lifetime marijuana use for teenagers in 10th-12th grade fell from 27.6 percent in 2001 to 21.6 percent in 2006. It also fell for teens in lower grades.Harris, however, has been adamant that decriminalizing or legalizing of any form of marijuana will have only one result. ""Even medical marijuana legalization increases drug use,"" he said on Bennett's ""Morning in America"" show. ""You can't take any step at all because where you end up, it's going to be inevitable and it ends with increased drug use.""Asked last month for clarification on Harris' position, his spokeswoman Erin Montgomery said, ""Passing marijuana decriminalization bills for teens is not the way to lower D.C.’s high rate of drug abuse among teens and definitely not the way to deal with skyrocketing teen unemployment in the District, especially among minority youth.""Marijuana advocates argue, however, that legalizing the drug could have benefits related specifically to teen pot use. Tom Angell, chairman of Marijuana Majority, said that ""legalizing and regulating the marijuana trade allows for age restrictions to be enacted and enforced.""Angell pointed to sting operations in Colorado, where recreational marijuana was legalized earlier this year, as evidence that age restrictions can be properly monitored and enforced. When Colorado officials sent underage shoppers into 20 different stores selling marijuana, none was able to buy the drug.Another activist argued that Harris' views on the sale of alcohol are apparently at odds with his views on marijuana.""Scientific research and government reports have concluded that marijuana is less addictive than alcohol, less damaging to the body and less likely to contribute to violent and reckless behavior,"" said Mason Tvert, director of communications for the Marijuana Policy Project. Yet, Tvert added, Harris ""has gladly accepted thousands of dollars in contributions from those who distribute it [alcohol] to Americans.""Harris' efforts to block D.C.'s new pot policy began in June, when he attached an amendment to an appropriations bill that would bar the District from spending any money on efforts to lessen the penalty for marijuana possession. (The appropriations rider is a strategy that congressional Republicans have routinely used to meddle with the city, which doesn't have final say over its own criminal laws.) The Maryland lawmaker has drawn sharp condemnation from many D.C. officials and the District's non-voting representative in Congress, Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D).Speaking on the House floor late last week, Norton lambasted Harris for trying to ""bully"" her constituents. ""You will occasionally hear members say something only a tyrant would say,"" Norton said. ""Rep. Andy Harris was unable to convince his own state not to decriminalize marijuana, so he steps across the border into the District of Columbia to try to tell us what to do?"" Harris' effort seems to run in opposition to the current bipartisan push to change the way non-violent drug offenders are punished. Earlier in July, Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.) and Rand Paul (R-Ky.) teamed up to introduce the REDEEM Act, aimed at reforming the criminal justice system as it pertains to teens and non-violent offenders, including anyone convicted under drug possession laws. On Friday, the U.S. Sentencing Commission elected to make new sentencing guidelines for federal drug-related offenses retroactive -- a move that will affect about 50,000 individuals.The District's local decriminalization measure passed earlier this year, with support from many D.C. residents. Its main sponsor framed it as an issue of racial justice, citing studies that showed up to 90 percent of those arrested for possession in the city are African-American.Norton similarly noted last week that decriminalizing marijuana would help teens, particularly blacks who are four times more likely than whites to be arrested for possession in D.C. despite relatively equal use across racial lines.""Do you know what that means for a young black man or boy in this country today? It ruins their lives,"" Norton said on the House floor. ""An arrest or a conviction of any kind for 'drug possession' … can lead a young man in the District of Columbia to the underground economy, even to selling drugs from where he was only possessing them before, because he can't find a job because he's got a 'record.'""Harris does not see this as a race issue, though, telling The Washington Post, ""This is astounding to me, to go and say that somehow this is a problem that is due to white guys. I don’t get it."" "
14,GREEN,Fracking Waste Affecting Water Supply In Dry California,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/california-fracking-contamination_n_5600512.html,,2014-07-19,"A jar holding waste water from hydraulic fracturing is held up to the light at a recycling site in Midland, Texas, Sept. 24, 2013. The drilling method known as fracking uses huge amounts of high-pressure, chemical-laced water to free oil and natural gas trapped deep in underground rocks. With fresh water not as plentiful companies have been looking for ways to recycle their waste. (AP Photo/Pat Sullivan)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb15acc3c000066000bcaf4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This article originally appeared on ProPublica.California officials have ordered an emergency shut-down of 11 oil and gas waste injection sites and a review more than 100 others in the state's drought-wracked Central Valley out of fear that companies may have been pumping fracking fluids and other toxic waste into drinking water aquifers there.The state's Division of Oil and Gas and Geothermal Resources on July 7 issued cease and desist orders to seven energy companies warning that they may be injecting their waste into aquifers that could be a source of drinking water, and stating that their waste disposal ""poses danger to life, health, property, and natural resources."" The orders were first reported by the Bakersfield Californian, and the state has confirmed with ProPublica that its investigation is expanding to look at additional wells.The action comes as California's agriculture industry copes with a drought crisis that has emptied reservoirs and cost the state $2.2 billion this year alone. The lack of water has forced farmers across the state to supplement their water supply from underground aquifers, according to a study released this week by the University of California Davis.The problem is that at least 100 of the state's aquifers were presumed to be useless for drinking and farming because the water was either of poor quality, or too deep underground to easily access. Years ago, the state exempted them from environmental protection and allowed the oil and gas industry to intentionally pollute them. But not all aquifers are exempted, and the system amounts to a patchwork of protected and unprotected water resources deep underground. Now, according to the cease and desist orders issued by the state, it appears that at least seven injection wells are likely pumping waste into fresh water aquifers protected by the law, and not other aquifers sacrificed by the state long ago.""The aquifers in question with respect to the orders that have been issued are not exempt,"" said Ed Wilson, a spokesperson for the California Department of Conservation in an email.A 2012 ProPublica investigation of more than 700,000 injection wells across the country found that wells were often poorly regulated and experienced high rates of failure, outcomes that were likely polluting underground water supplies that are supposed to be protected by federal law. That investigation also disclosed a little-known program overseen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency that exempted more than 1,000 other drinking water aquifers from any sort of pollution protection at all, many of them in California.Those are the aquifers at issue today. The exempted aquifers, according to documents the state filed with the U.S. EPA in 1981 and obtained by ProPublica, were poorly defined and ambiguously outlined. They were often identified by hand-drawn lines on a map, making it difficult to know today exactly which bodies of water were supposed to be protected, and by which aspects of the governing laws. Those exemptions and documents were signed by California Gov. Jerry Brown, who also was governor in 1981.State officials emphasized to ProPublica that they will now order water testing and monitoring at the injection well sites in question. To date, they said, they have not yet found any of the more regulated aquifers to have been contaminated.""We do not have any direct evidence any drinking water has been affected,"" wrote Steve Bohlen, the state oil and gas supervisor, in a statement to ProPublica.Bohlen said his office was acting ""out of an abundance of caution,"" and a spokesperson said that the state became aware of the problems through a review of facilities it was conducting according to California's fracking law passed late last year, which required the state to study fracking impacts and adopt regulations to address its risks, presumably including underground disposal.California officials have long been under fire for their injection well practices, a waste disposal program that the state runs according to federal law and under a sort of license — called ""primacy"" — given to it by the EPA.For one, experts say that aquifers the states and the EPA once thought would never be needed may soon become important sources of water as the climate changes and technology reduces the cost of pumping it from deep underground and treating it for consumption. Indeed, towns in Wyoming and Texas — two states also suffering long-term droughts — are pumping, treating, then delivering drinking water to taps from aquifers which would be considered unusable under California state regulations governing the oil and gas industry.In June 2011, the EPA conducted a review of other aspects of California's injection well program and found enforcement, testing and oversight problems so significant that the agency demanded California improve its regulations and warned that the state's authority could be revoked.Among the issues, California and the federal government disagree about what type of water is worth protecting in the first place, with California law only protecting a fraction of the waters that the federal Safe Drinking Water Act requires.The EPA's report, commissioned from outside consultants, also said that California regulators routinely failed to adequately examine the geology around an injection well to ensure that fluids pumped into it would not leak underground and contaminate drinking water aquifers. The report found that state inspectors often allowed injection at pressures that exceeded the capabilities of the wells and thus risked cracking the surrounding rock and spreading contaminants. Several accidents in recent years in California involved injected waste or injected steam leaking back out of abandoned wells, or blowing out of the ground and creating sinkholes, including one 2011 incident that killed an oil worker.The exemptions and other failings, said Damon Nagami, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council in an email, are ""especially disturbing"" in a state that has been keenly aware of severe water constraints for more than a century and is now suffering from a crippling drought. ""Our drinking water sources must be protected and preserved for the precious resources they are, not sacrificed as a garbage dump for the oil and gas industry.""Still, three years after the EPA's report, California has not yet completed its review of its underground injection program, according to state officials. The scrutiny of the wells surrounding Bakersfield may be the start."

But proponents fought to amend the state's so-called safe handgun requirements, arguing that it exempted for single-shot pistols which meant dealers were selling thousands of modified weapons per year without a required safety feature that indicates when a bullet is chambered.""This is a significant step to protect the integrity of the safe handgun law in California,"" assemblyman Roger Dickinson, a Democrat who authored the bill, told Reuters. ""This exception has been increasingly used by those who wish to circumvent (the law).""The bill comes amid a protracted national debate over the extent of gun restrictions after a series of deadly rampages in schools, movie theaters, and other public places.The legislation drew swift criticism from the National Rifle Association (NRA) and the California Association of Federal Firearms Licensees (CAL-FFL), groups that say such laws trample constitutional rights.""Sadly, the status quo for elitist Sacramento politicians is to ignore the Constitution and act with blatant hostility towards our Second Amendment civil rights and sound public policy,"" said Brandon Combs, president of the CAL-FFL.The NRA has said the measure would hurt law-abiding citizens by ""eliminating the only options for Californians to purchase numerous handguns that are commonly owned throughout the rest of the country.""Under existing California law, semi-automatic weapons must have an indicator showing when there is a bullet in the chamber. But many manufacturers do not include the feature, leading some dealers to convert guns to single-shot weapons before selling them, though they are later reverted back, Dickinson said.The loophole was created after single-shot weapons were exempted from the safety requirement to protect collectors of antique guns, Dickinson said, adding the new law strives to protect antique single-shot weapons prized by collectors.The new law ensures handguns must meet other safety measures, such as firing tests, Dickinson said.It preserves exceptions under specific requirements, such as a single-shot pistol with a break top or bolt action, a barrel length of at least six inches, among other requirements, according to analysis on the state legislature's website.(Reporting by Sharon Bernstein in Sacramento; Writing by Eric M.

Can they go beyond a playoff berth, and make the World Series, their first trip since winning it all in 2002? The 2014 Angels are more than capable.The Angels Most Valuable Player this season has undoubtedly been center fielder Mike Trout, who is poised to take home his first American League MVP award. Trout has defied all logic again this year, batting .310 with 22 Home Runs and 73 Runs Batted In, along with 65 runs, 10 steals, and a .400 On Base Percentage.Trout's numbers are supposed to be videogame statistics, not the midseason line of a third year player turning the ripe old age of 23 in August. Trout has captured the hearts of Southern California -- along with the rest of the country -- with his exciting play. Trout's MVP performance in Tuesday's All-Star Game solidifies him as an exciting national star.Trout leads an Angel offense that is an absolute juggernaut. Through 94 games, the lineup scored 478 runs, leading the majors. Outfielder Kole Calhoun missed time in May, but has been solid batting lead off, with a .295 average and 49 runs in just 59 games. If they are healthy, Calhoun, Trout, first baseman Albert Pujols, right fielder Josh Hamilton, second baseman Howie Kendrick, and shortstop Erick Aybar could form the most dangerous offensive force in all of baseball during the second half. Aybar, who made the All-Star team by batting .283 with 6 HR's and 50 RBI's, is arguably the team's 6th strongest hitter. When your 6th best hitter's an All-Star, watch out.While Trout and the offense's performance this year was more or less expected, one player whose sheer brilliance was unforeseen has been starting pitcher, Garrett Richards.Richards stands 6'3 and possesses a devastating 96 MPH fastball that can touch even higher. After a disappointing 2013 in which he had a 7-8 record and a 4.16 ERA, Richards has taken a gigantic step forward. So far, he has posted an 11-2 record with a 2.55 ERA. Richards entered the break riding a 7 game winning streak, proving to be one of the toughest starters in the American League. With a rotation of Jered Weaver, C.J. Wilson, Richards, Tyler Skaggs and Hector Santiago, the Angels will compete with any rotation in the American League.The bullpen, the weak point of the squad, took a step forward in July when reliever Joe Smith stepped into the closer's role. With Smith in the 9th, the Angels can nail down a 1 or 2 run lead.And yet, the Angels are still in second place. The Oakland A's had a remarkable first half, posting a franchise record 59 wins before the All-Star break. The A's pitching staff will be electric with the addition of Jeff Samardzija and Jason Hammel from the Chicago Cubs. That trade leaves little doubt the A's are all in on the 2014 season. The A's all-star closer, Sean Doolittle, has been unhittable with a 2.89 ERA and astounding 63 strikeouts to just 2 walks.The A's lineup is admittedly tough. The Angels may have scored the most runs in the league, but can you guess who's second? Oakland. For all the hype that back-to-back Home Run Derby champion Yoenis Cespedes receives, it is Brandon Moss who has been the A's top batter, with 21 HR's and 66 RBI's at the break. While Moss is unstoppable against right handed pitching, the outfielder loses his power against lefties. Moss has hit only 3 home runs this season against lefties, and 18 against righties. In 2013, Moss hit just .200 versus lefties.Why does this matter for the Angels? Three of their five starting pitchers -- Wilson, Skaggs, and Santiago -- are left-handed. In upcoming head-to-head battles, the Angels gain an advantage when facing an A's lineup heavily dependent on lefty Moss for power. The A's are beatable.Trout and the Angels are roaring back in the American League, but they will not be satisfied with the Wild Card. In 2014, the Angels have bigger fish to fry.Contributions to this article made by Matt Steinberg"

The United States and Europe strengthened sanctions on Moscow over Ukraine yesterday, with President Barack Obama taking his first direct swipes in the finance, military and energy sectors of the Russian economy. Putin warned the biting sanctions will boomerang and hit back at US national interests, will inflicting 'very serious damage' on an already tattered US-Russia relationship. AFP PHOTO / RIA-NOVOSTI / POOL / ALEXEI NIKOLSKY (Photo credit should read ALEXEI NIKOLSKY/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13a8d240000350076e295.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"KIEV -- My heart is bleeding for the innocent victims who died in a crash of a Malaysian airliner two days ago. This tragedy left no one in Ukraine without tears. For many months, we have been mourning the death of the sons and daughters of Ukraine, and now that the Kremlin's belligerence has claimed innocent lives of Dutch, Malaysian, Australian and Indonesian citizens, it pains us no less and our entire nation is grieving with the world.As an investigation into the exact details of the crash continues, it is too early to draw definitive conclusions, but to understand the broader context in which this catastrophe has occurred, we must chronicle the events leading up to it and examine the root causes of the unrest in eastern Ukraine.A month ago, the terrorists shot down a Ukrainian military transport plane killing 49 people. The leader of an alleged grassroots separatist movement known as DNR (Donetsk People's Republic) is a Russian national, who is also believed to be an officer of Russian security services -- Mr. Girkin. Reuters reported that ""the European Union added Strelkov (aka Girkin) to its sanctions list on April 29, describing him as a staff member of Russia's GRU military intelligence."" There is no shortage of evidence when it comes to supplies of sophisticated weapons coming from Russia into eastern Ukraine. How can anyone possibly procure a latest-generation Russian-made grenade launcher, or a tank, or a ground-to-air missile? Is it imaginable that such arsenals just ""fall into the hands"" of terrorists and Mr. Putin has nothing to do with it?On the Malaysian plane crash, Ukrainian intelligence services are actively cooperating with the international community and have released an audio tape that clearly implicates the DNR terrorists. But here again, we have to wait for an independent verification and the conclusion of the official investigation. Kyiv Post reported on the involvement of Mr. Girkin, alleging that he had taken credit for shooting down a plane. Believing that he had downed a Ukrainian military aircraft, Mr. Girkin made an announcement on social media, but he took it off promptly after realizing that this was not the case.Mr. Putin has had many opportunities to condemn the violence, but he has failed every time. I want his words to be addressed to Girkin and other Russian citizens disturbing Ukraine, not to my president. Putin's silence, which effectively condones the terrorists' activities in eastern Ukraine, bares a grave cost. Ending the violence has been the essence of an agreement reached in Geneva many months ago to which Russia was a signatory. The terrible tragedy that took the lives of 298 people, 80 of whom are innocent children, is a direct or an indirect consequence of Putin's policy towards Ukraine. The hybrid war waged by Russia has now spilled beyond our borders. There is nothing we can do to bring back the lives lost, but we owe to the victims and their families a full investigation, and we owe it to the world to stop the Kremlin's aggression now."

Mitch McConnell rides in the Fountain Run BBQ Festival parade with his wife Elaine Chao while campaigning for the Republcian primary May 17, 2014 in Fountain Run, Kentucky. McConnell and challenger Matt Bevin are campaigning heavily throughout the state during the final weekend before the primary to be held May 20. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e6915812600000223b62d81.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- This year, for the first time since the Supreme Court's 2010 Citizens United ruling unleashed the unlimited-money super PAC, the majority of Senate races feature super PACs that focus on just one candidate.These personalized super PACs had entered the presidential contest in a big way in 2012, as groups emerged to back President Barack Obama, GOP nominee Mitt Romney and practically every other Republican candidate running in the primaries. The groups also appeared in some Senate and House races that year -- but it was nothing like their prevalence today.The personalized super PAC has become the hot new weapon in 2014's heavily contested Senate races and crucial in some House primary contests. With four months to go until the election, the amount of money raised by these groups is already closing in on the total they spent in the 2012 congressional races.By the end of June, single-candidate super PACs had raised $35.6 million or slightly less than the $40 million such groups raised for all congressional races in 2012, according to a review of Federal Election Commission records by The Huffington Post. Twenty-two of the 36 Senate contests -- which include both seats in Oklahoma and South Carolina -- feature at least one single-candidate super PAC. Overall, there are 41 in play at the Senate level.""It just shows you how quickly and dynamically things are changing,"" said Daniel Tokaji, an election law professor at The Ohio State University's Moritz College of Law and co-author of a recent report on super PACs and other independent political groups. ""Evolution isn't the right word for it. We've seen massive shifts.""Back in 2011, Democracy 21 President Fred Wertheimer issued a warning over the presidential-wannabe super PACs. ""If these candidate super PACs are not shut down quickly, they will also spread like wildfire to Congress and come into routine use by senators and representatives and their political associates,"" he said. The dean of campaign finance reformers was on target.These groups are now fully deployed in every real Senate battle. They have been a little slower to spread to the lower chamber: In the 16 House contests featuring single-candidate super PACs, all but two of those groups have been entirely focused on a primary election.Who fills for these war chests? Donors range from family and friends of the favored candidate, to loyal party contributors, local businesses and even ultimately undisclosed sources.In some cases, these single-candidate super PACs, which are directing their efforts to one state, nonetheless receive significant funds from a larger super PAC with a national profile.Put Alaska First, which supports Sen. Mark Begich (D), has raised $4.4 million, more money than any other single-candidate super PAC. Nearly of its funds have come from Senate Majority PAC, a national Democratic group, and not from Alaska donors.In North Carolina, the Grow NC Strong group backing Republican Senate nominee Thom Tillis has received $170,000 -- more than half its funding -- from American Crossroads, the national super PAC founded by Karl Rove.All Citizens for Mississippi, a super PAC run by Bishop Ronnie Crudup to help get out the African-American vote for Sen. Thad Cochran in the bitter GOP primary campaign, was fully funded by another pro-Cochran super PAC, Mississippi Conservatives. The latter group was, in turn, partially funded by American Crossroads and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is backed by a similarly connected super PAC. Kentuckians for Strong Leadership, which has raised $3.7 million, does not receive moneys from an umbrella group, but it is run by the head of American Crossroads, uses the same media team as American Crossroads and raises money from the same donors as American Crossroads.In a number of other cases, these super PACs, which are legally barred from coordinating with the candidates they support, are funded by family members of those candidates.Republican Senate candidate Dan Sullivan, who is running to oust Alaska's Begich, is backed by a super PAC funded by his family and individuals connected to his family's Ohio-based business. A super PAC supporting Democratic House candidate Gabriel Rothblatt, who is challenging Florida Rep. Bill Posey (R), is funded by the candidate's mother, United Therapeutics CEO Martine Rothblatt.Oklahoma Republican Mike Turner was helped in his failed primary bid for a House seat by a super PAC to which his family's trust contributed. Maxey Scherr, a losing candidate in Texas' Democratic Senate primary, was similarly boosted by a super PAC funded by her family members.In one of the oddest pairings, Republican candidate George Demos, who ran (and lost in the primary) for a New York House seat as a tea party-type bomb-thrower, was supported by a super PAC that received more than $1.3 million from his father-in-law and major Democratic donor Angelo Tsakopoulos.Friends and business associates of the candidates are also jumping in to boost these supposedly independent groups.Sen. Al Franken (D-Minn.) has even helped raise money for the WIN Minnesota PAC, which backs his re-election. (A candidate can legally raise money for a super PAC so long as he or she asks for no more than $5,200 per person.) Donors include Franken friends from Hollywood and New York like Larry David, Michael Douglas, Bette Midler, Mike Myers, Seth MacFarlane, Bill Maher and James Belushi.New Hampshire Republican candidate Daniel Innis, who is challenging Rep. Carol Shea-Porter (D), receives support from a super PAC funded by businessman Peter T. Paul. Innis had previously solicited $25 million from Paul for the University of New Hampshire business school where he served as dean.In Nebraska Senate candidate Ben Sasse's case, the GOP nominee received the backing of a super PAC funded by his great-uncle Robert Dunklau, who also had a business school named after him at Midland University, where Sasse was president. Sasse had solicited a super PAC contribution of $5,000 from Dunklau, who actually gave $100,000.These kinds of close ties between super PAC donors and super PAC beneficiaries raise questions about the possibility of improper coordination. In a recent report based on interviews with former members of Congress and political operatives, Moritz College of Law professors Tokaji and Renata E.B. Strause found that the wall between super PACs and candidates is, in practice, incredibly thin and easily evaded.""[A]t the end of the day, it’s all just kind of a fiction –- it’s just kind of a farce, the whole campaign finance non-coordination thing,"" an unnamed campaign operative told the professors.The single-candidate super PACs that do not rely on one larger super PAC or a friends-and-family connection often tap a mix of national party donors and local business interests. In fact, many single-candidate super PACs receive a larger share of their contributions from corporations than do their national, party-linked counterparts.Southern Conservatives Fund, a super PAC supporting Republican candidate Jack Kingston -- who is running for the Georgia seat being vacated by Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R) -- has received more than half of its $748,000 from Georgia-based corporations. These include Medicare supplemental insurance seller State Mutual Insurance Company, real estate property owner Walters Management Company and elderly care facility operator PruittHealth.The Mississippi Conservatives super PAC that helped Thad Cochran win the Republican nomination also received a big boost from business interests, including Bollinger Shipyards, a past recipient of Cochran's directed appropriations, and Ergon, which operates an ethanol plant that receives subsidies supported by the senator.Local businesses similarly aided Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho) when he, like Cochran, faced a more conservative primary challenger. The pro-Simpson Gem State Prosperity Fund was run by the Idaho Association of Commerce and Industry and took contributions from J.R. Simplot Company, Potlatch, Micron Technology, Blue Cross of Idaho Health Service and the Idaho Association of Realtors.A super PAC supporting Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) has raised money from Atlantic Cellular Investments, the hedge fund Blue Ridge Capital and a holding company for MicroStrategy stock named Alcantara LLC.And then there are two single-candidate super PACs that are primarily funded by ""dark money"" nonprofits, which do not need to publicly disclose their donors.In Georgia's Republican Senate primary, the Citizens for a Working America PAC, which backs businessman David Perdue, has received nearly all of its $2.1 million from two non-disclosing nonprofits, the Jobs and Progress Fund Inc. and the Government Integrity Fund. The Government Integrity Fund has also pumped $1.05 million into the super PAC Government Integrity Fund Action Network, which supports Arkansas Republican nominee Tom Cotton in his challenge to Sen. Mark Pryor (D).Because they must report their contributors to the FEC, the money pouring into single-candidate super PACs this year -- and the links between that money and the candidates -- can at least be tracked. Kentucky, Oklahoma and other states have also seen a rise in dark money groups focused on single candidates, and their donors are secret."
20,BUSINESS,How to Find the ROI in Social,"Ted Rubin, ContributorSocial Marketing Strategist, Keynote Speaker, Brand Evangelist...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-find-the-roi-in-so_b_5599982.html,"In the world of coordinated creation of social media stories, there's typically two kinds of success, or ROI, on social campaigns -- Cost Mitigation and Sales Increase.",2014-07-19,2014-07-18-530724_10151138080998401_1474869815_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-18-530724_10151138080998401_1474869815_n-thumb.jpg,"In the world of coordinated creation of social media stories, there's typically two kinds of success, or ROI, on social campaigns -- Cost Mitigation and Sales Increase. And I believe there is a Return on Relationship (ROR) fostered by all brand relevant content and communication... simply put the value that is accrued by a person or brand due to nurturing a relationship. ROI is simple $'s and cents, ROR is the value (both perceived and real) that will accrue over time through loyalty, recommendations and sharing.With Cost Mitigation, it is important to look at success as generating more impressions than traditional media, for the same spend, or generating the same impressions for significantly less money. It's purely a CPM play. This is great for consumer packaged goods brands who have a large marketing budget, and view social as simply one part of their communication plan... and can work for any other brands who see the important of brand awareness.A valuable method of defining ROI of Social is around annualized customer value. Typically a consumer who regularly absorbs content that references a brand in one manner or another is a more valuable customer than a non-fan/follower/subscriber. They may spend more (average order value, AOV) and visit more often and make more purchases (frequency of purchase), remain loyal customer for a longer period of time (lifetime value of a customer) and very often all three. Very similar to legacy Loyalty Program metrics. Finding that average value isn't all that difficult, and can give you a KPI for tracking when starting Social, when ramping it up, or pulling it back.When combining consumer and influencer-generated content, engagement and amplified online syndication, correctly structured and maintained Social involvement, engagement and connection will produce significant results including Search Engine Optimization results that last, an increase in online Share of Voice (SOV) compared to competitors (very important and easily measurable), and engaged impressions and reach that drive brand awareness, loyalty and ultimately sales conversion. In addition start measuring and looking at how a strong Social presence affects your Net Promoter Score (NPS) Quarter to quarter (How likely is it that you would recommend our company/product/service to a friend or colleague? The scoring for this answer is most often based on a 0 to 10 scale).To simplify things a bit into a couple of easily digestible soundbites, this is a basic approach to how I view Social, and it's long-term relationship to ROI... Being Social drives Engagement, Engagement drives Loyalty and Advocacy, and both correlate directly to Increased Sales. ROR (#RonR) = ROIAwareness = Revenues, Differentiators = Margins, Authenticity = Loyalty/Advocacy... All Measurable AND = Increased Sales/Profits."

Put them to use in salads, parfaits, muffins and more...  1. Peaches & Berries with Lemon-Mint SyrupThis elegant and refreshing fruit salad is perfect for summer entertaining. It's delicious on its own as a healthy dessert but also pairs well with pound cake, vanilla ice cream -- or both! GET THE RECIPE2. Best Blueberry MuffinsBursting with fresh blueberries with a tender, cakey crumb and sparkling sugar crust, these really are the best blueberry muffins. I've tried fussier recipes that call for mashing some of the blueberries into the batter or even swirling homemade blueberry jam into the mix, but there's no need for all that - this simple recipe tops them all. GET THE RECIPE3. Baby Spinach Salad with Fresh Berries, Pecans & Goat Cheese in a Raspberry VinaigretteUsually we think of fresh berries as something to eat for breakfast or dessert, but they also make an elegant addition to a savory salad of baby spinach, pecans and goat cheese. I love it as a first course for an outdoor dinner party (it's so pretty and always elicits oohs and aahs), but it's also great served alongside grilled chicken or fish for a luncheon or informal dinner. GET THE RECIPE4. Strawberry Frozen YogurtThis strawberry treat bears no resemblance to store-bought frozen yogurt or the imitation ice cream served at most fro-yo shops. Instead, it tastes intensely of fresh strawberries -- almost like a cross between strawberry frozen yogurt and strawberry sorbet. My eight-year-old daughter said it best: ""It tastes very strawberry-y."" GET THE RECIPE 5. Double Chocolate Pavlova with Mascarpone Whipped Cream and RaspberriesCreated by a hotel chef in the 1920s in honor of the Russian ballet dancer Anna Pavlova, a pavlova is a cake-shaped meringue with a soft and marshmallowy center and crisp outer shell, usually topped with whipped cream and fresh fruit. In this gorgeous chocolate version, cocoa powder and bittersweet chocolate are folded into the meringue -- which makes it deliciously fudgy -- and mascarpone cheese (Italian cream cheese) is added to the whipped topping. It's a wonderfully light, gluten-free dessert. GET THE RECIPE6. Lemon Berry ParfaitsFresh berries are delicious on their own but if you're looking for a way to dress them up, elegant parfaits are the way to go. Here, I've layered them with a luscious lemon cream -- essentially a lemon curd lightened with whipped cream -- to brighten their natural sweetness. GET THE RECIPE7. Simple Summer Strawberry CakeThis wonderful recipe was sent to me by Karen Tannenbaum, a longtime reader, avid cook and all-around lovely lady. It's one of the simplest, prettiest, most delicious cakes I've ever made. GET THE RECIPE8. Blueberry Maple Bran MuffinsThese blueberry muffins flavored with cinnamon and maple syrup strike the perfect balance between wholesome and indulgent. They're lower in fat and sugar than most muffins, enriched with nutritious wheat bran and whole wheat flour, and chockfull of antioxidant-rich blueberries. GET THE RECIPE9. Strawberry & Orange Salad with Citrus Syrup & Fresh MintThis is one of my favorite fruit salads, and it's such a nice change of pace from the standard mix of pre-cut fruit from the supermarket. I usually serve it for brunch -- it dresses up the table and pairs well with savory quiche and casserole dishes -- but it's also wonderful for dessert served with shortcake and whipped cream.
