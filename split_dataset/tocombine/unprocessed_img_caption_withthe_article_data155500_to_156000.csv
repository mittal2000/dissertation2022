0,WELLNESS,Hit a Plateau? Don't Let Perfectionism Prevent You From Bursting Through It,"Bob Sullivan, Contributor
Author and columnist for msnbc.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/overcome-perfectionism_us_5b9d210be4b03a1dcc84bcba,"Do you dwell on small mistakes for hours, days, or even weeks after they occur? Are you crushed when someone points out a small flaw in your work? Have you ever spent four hours fine-tuning a task that could have been completed in 10 minutes?",2013-05-08,silhouette of a girl student sitting on the floor and thinking,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d210b26000036007fbe6d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We all hit plateaus from time to time. Bodybuilders and dieters know this well. They begin a new regimen of weightlifting or starvation. For 10 days or so, the results are fantastic, even inspiring. Down four pounds, or up another 10 on the military press. But somewhere near that two-week mark, they hit a wall. The scale seems frozen in place. The strength gains top out. They have, cruelly, plateaued.Plateaus rob you of success. They make hard work worthless. They turn beginner's luck into sophomore slumps. They can even make you look lazy, dumb, careless, or unloving. You aren't any of these things. You've just been fighting an invisible enemy. Today, we wanted to talk about a trait that makes busting through plateaus needlessly difficult: perfectionism. Do you dwell on small mistakes for hours, days, or even weeks after they occur? Are you crushed when someone points out a small flaw in your work? Have you ever spent four hours fine-tuning a task that could have been completed in 10 minutes? Are you haunted by uncertainty when you finish a task, so nothing is ever feels finished? Have you ever hidden mistakes to avoid hearing one nagging comment from a friend or coworker? Can one negative comment from your boss or mother-in-law throw you into a tailspin? Do the words ""good enough"" make you cringe?If you're still held captive by a fear of failure or trying new things, you've hit perhaps the most toxic plateau cause of all: perfectionism.The quest for perfection is the enemy of improvement. At its worst, perfection is the ultimate weapon wielded by that great cosmic enemy of plateau-busting -- procrastination.In practical application, perfectionism often takes this one manifest form: It kills beginnings. Perfectionists are incapable of the kind of gray-area compromise required to takes to get things started or take things to a new level. They isolate themselves from new ideas and criticism, eliminating any chance that something new might arrive -- even a happy accident -- that could offer a breakthrough. The next time you want to start something new, ignore that impulse. Don't attempt comprehensive planning. Learn just enough to get started, and then get started. Then, learn how to do part two. If you're trying to replace the toilet in your bathroom, don't read up on the 47 ways the project can go wrong (plus, there's really only one -- if the new loo springs a leak). Read up on how to pull out the old one, then bend down and start yanking. After you get the sucker out, go back to Home Depot and ask them how to drop a new loo on a wax ring properly. Let's present a new concept that will serve as your antidote to the plateau of perfectionism: ""satisficing,"" a combination of the words satisfactory and suffice. With every task you undertake -- raising children, painting a Starbucks window, writing ad copy, making dinner -- your goal should be to do satisfactory work that is satisfying to you and its consumers, but at the same time is just enough to be sufficient. Satisficing takes much more into consideration than results: It weighs equally the pain and the process that are required to achieve a result. You might want to make the best salsa you've ever eaten, but that would require acquisition of the freshest vegetables. If the farmer's market doesn't open until tomorrow morning, and the guests are coming tonight, then you'll have to do with the more pedestrian tomatoes from the corner grocery store. Modern economists and behaviorists sometimes call this more realistic decision-making process ""bounded rationality"" -- because a ""fully rational"" decision-making process that considers all options is impossible in the real world, decision-makers simplify by self-limiting, or creating a boundary around their options.Perfectionists live lives of sameness, wondering why new things never come. Perfectionism is the enemy of good, and good enough. But in an elemental way, perfectionism is the galactic enemy of action itself. Getting over it is one of the keys to breaking through your plateaus -- whatever they are. Bob Sullivan and Herbert Thompson are the authors of The Plateau Effect: Getting from Stuck to Success. With more than 40 years of experience between them researching, writing, and analyzing systems and human nature, their new book helps you bust through the plateaus in your own life.For more by Bob Sullivan, click here.For more on success and motivation, click here."
1,WELLNESS,Seasonal Allergies Stealing Your Sleep? How To Find Relief,Sarah Klein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/seasonal-allergies-sleep_us_5b9d171de4b03a1dcc845c79,"Since, by many accounts, this allergy season is bound to be a bad one, that's advice worth heeding. In a recent study published",2013-05-07,"USA, New Jersey, Jersey City, Young woman blowing nose in bed",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d171d2000002d00fdd370.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As if seasonal allergies weren't bad enough, the itchy eyes, sneezing and stuffed-up noses are stealing something very valuable from a number of sufferers: sleep!A recent survey from the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America found that 59 percent of people with nasal allergies say they have trouble sleeping because of their symptoms. And 48 percent say their sneezing and sniffling also disturb their bed partner's sleep.Despite all that sneezing cutting into their precious shuteye, only 35 percent are actively seeking treatment for their symptoms, according to the online poll of 2,000 U.S. adults.In a recent study published in Internal Medicine, researchers found that even when people thought they got a good night's rest, 44 percent of allergy sufferers woke up feeling groggy and tired, Men's Health reported.Considering 41 million American workers say they don't get enough sleep and about 10 percent of people report bothersome symptoms of seasonal allergies, a few preventive measures are in order.First, it's important to understand why allergies can interrupt sleep. Allergies cause the nasal passages to swell, explains Dr. Mark Holbreich, a fellow of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology in private practice in Indianapolis, meaning there's less room for air to pass freely, making breathing difficult. At night, gravity certainly doesn't help: When you lie down to go to sleep, that congestion can shift, making nose breathing even more difficult, Dr. Jennifer Collins told Healthy Living in January.Allergy sufferers should be sure to abide by the crucial rules of good sleep hygiene, including keeping the bedroom cool, dark and quiet, avoiding caffeine too late in the day and powering down electronic devices at least an hour before bed (and leaving them outside the bedroom).It also can't hurt to try some common natural allergy remedies like showering before bed, keeping the windows closed and regularly changing sheets and pillow cases. A steamy bath or shower or a warm cup of tea can also help loosen congestion so you'll breathe easier as you sleep.But it may take something a little more powerful to truly give you relief, says Holbreich. If itchiness, sneezing or a runny nose is your main complaint, an over-the-counter antihistamine might help, but those typically don't offer much in terms of breaking up congestion, he warns. A prescription medication, typically a nasal steroid spray, is usually more effective at restoring your breathing ability.Other allergy sufferers may find relief from a nasal saline rinse, he says, which helps by directly reducing swelling in the nasal passages, but also washing out any pollen that may be in your nose.Just don't go looking for relief in a cold medicine, says Holbreich. ""They're good for three to five days, but if you use them for any length of time, you can get congestion as a sign of overuse,"" he says. ""Over-the-counter decongestants give immediate relief, but they're not suited for a long allergy season.""Since, by many accounts, this allergy season is bound to be a bad one, that's advice worth heeding.Do you find your allergies disturb your sleep?

2,DIVORCE,The Blame Game: Why Moms Need to Grow Up,"Joelle Fraser, Contributor
Author, 'The Forest House,' 'The Territory of Men'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-blame-game-why-moms-n_us_5b9d209be4b03a1dcc84b4e1,"One of the tragedies of split custody is depending on the warmth between you and your ex, your child is out of your control. It might be for days at a time. You have to bury your worry and love, so that you don't waste the time you're apart -- so that when you do get your child back, you're not a clingy basket-case.",2013-05-07,Portrait of smiling daughter wrapped in blanket with mother at lakeside,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d209b2500003200365553.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I was on my way to work when I heard about the Newtown massacre. The horror itself was bad enough, but I had a first-grader -- the same age as those fallen children -- and so the nightmare lodged in my heart every minute of that day and beyond. I could constantly summon the sounds and smells of my son's classroom, but what I couldn't find was my son. He wasn't in class, and my ex wasn't answering his phone.Deep down, I knew he was safe, the way we have faith that the day will unfold much the way yesterday does. My ex-husband is a great father, and so when I don't have my son half the week, I don't worry too much, not like I did when we first split custody three years ago. I've learned, for the most part, to assume my son is OK, that he's content, that he hasn't had a bad dream or skinned his knee and wants a hug from mom. But that day, I needed to see Dylan, or at least hear his voice. It was hours before I found out my ex had taken him out of school for a day errand in another town. I finally talked to Dylan later that afternoon, imagining his face as he told me he missed me.That's one of the tragedies of split custody; sometimes, depending on the warmth between you and your ex, your child is out of your control. It might be for days at a time. You have to bury your worry and love, so that you don't waste the time you're apart -- so that when you do get your child back, you're not a clingy basket-case. And when you're reunited, you have to withstand the urge to put your life unnaturally on hold because of the yearning to focus on this little boy who's been gone for four days. It's a pendulum life: full-time with child, then full-time without. Such a life creates a strange rhythm; it's like trying to dance to a song forever out of tune. Sometimes the separation isn't so bad. You distract yourself with work, with rest if you can get it. And when the grief comes, if you have a man in your life, you ask him to hold you to stop the shaking.But then Newtown happens. And every other year you spend Christmas morning alone while your child opens his gifts in another house, in another town, and maybe you'll see him that evening and maybe you won't. Plans change, snowstorms pour down from the sky. And suddenly your child's room is empty for an extra day.Then there's your ex -- who will he meet? What kind of woman will she be? Will she treat your child with the love he needs? This too is out of your control, and such thoughts can keep peace forever out of reach. So when I wrote a blog recently for this site about the challenges of dating as a single mom, I was naively surprised at the hostility, the criticism, and the sheer self-righteousness that spewed forth from both single and married moms. The theme of these comments was that half-time moms have it easy.But we can all envy each other for something, can't we? Single women get all the pity -- they get the martyr's brass ring. Married mothers -- stay-at-home and working -- soak up society's approval for shouldering the dwindling dream of the American Family. And half-time moms like me? When our children aren't around, we're either shooting up the ladder of success or having a wild sex life and partying like rock stars while living off our ex-husbands. We have no right to complain because we broke the rules and got divorced -- never mind that getting divorced is, as Barbara Kingsolver wrote, ""as much fun as cutting off your own gangrenous arm."" In the end, we're all carrying clichés on our backs. Maybe it's time we took them off. Maybe it's time we stopped making assumptions about how much greener the lawn is in the neighbor's yard. I can't speak for fathers (though I want to know), but my theory about mothers is that we all have so much guilt that we hold on onto what makes us feel better, even if it drags another mother down. But resenting each other for what we don't have is both ugly and cruel. I don't see the point. Aren't we all under the same pressure to be a good mother?I know you have it tough in a hundred different ways, whether you're a Working Mom, Stay-at-Home mom, Single Mom, Half-Time Mom, Step-Mom, or some other category. I also know you feel the same joy when your child runs into your arms for a hug, or says -- just when you need it most --""I love you, Mom.""So if you see me at the park with Dylan, please don't envy me or resent me. How about this: just be my friend."

4,TRAVEL,Bogota: Colombia's Capital for Cuisine and Cocktails,"Jeff Thelen, Contributor
Co-Founder of TheFigCo",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bogota-cuisine_us_5b9d1e8ce4b03a1dcc849d12,"With all the new attention Colombia's been getting, I'm finding myself overwhelmed with trying to keep up with all the requests of friends -- and friends of friends -- for local insights into Bogota's vibrant restaurant and nightlife scene.",2013-05-07,"Colombia, Bogota, international and banking area, elevated view",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d1e8c2000002d00fdd61f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Good times at Andres Carne de Res! Photo credit: Michael ThelenYou may have seen one of the Colombian tourism advertisements: ""The only risk is wanting to stay."" It is cheesy but true, and many Americans, including friends and I, succumbed to this risk.Ever since my first visit to Colombia in 2006, I've encouraged others to come here on their next vacation. After all, Colombia is the happiest country on earth.In recent months, Anthony Bourdain, Martha Stewart and Paris Hilton visited Colombia with their cameras in tow to experience Colombia's allure and share it with their audiences.With all the new attention Colombia's been getting, I'm finding myself overwhelmed with trying to keep up with all the requests of friends -- and friends of friends -- for local insights into Bogota's vibrant restaurant and nightlife scene. I thought I'd get this all down on one list for everyone's benefit.Bon appétit!Where to find unforgettable foodAny list of restaurants and bars has to include Andres Carne de Res (Andres) in Chia. Go with a group of friends, order chicharones, papas criollas, arepa de choclo and any of their many steaks, and wash it all down with a bottle of aguardiente. The food is great and the party is even better! I promise it is worth the 45-minute journey outside of Bogota!  Lima, Peru, is likely the gastronomic capital of Latin America, however many of Lima's top chefs have restaurants in Bogota. If you're in the mood for ceviche, arroz chaufa, lomo saltado, or other Peruvian specialties, try Astrid & Gaston, La Mar or Rafael. If you're undecided on where to have dinner, I'd suggest walking down Carrera 13 between Calle 85 and 86a and just choosing a restaurant. You can't go wrong between Central Cevicheria (ceviche/seafood), La Brasserie (French), Casa (Mediterranean) or Di Lucca (Italian). There are a few newer restaurants that I really love as well. Enjoy French food and listen to a live band or DJ at Bandido Bistro, have great American-style BBQ at La Fama Barbecue or try the burger at Gordo.If you're looking for traditional Colombian food, I recommend visiting Club Colombia. Don't let the fact it is named after a local beer fool you- - this place is snazzy.On Sundays, make sure to wander around the mercado de pulgas (flea market) in Usaquen and have a late lunch in one of the restaurants near Parque Usaquen, the main square. Abasto, La Mar (mentioned above), Amarti, and 80 Sillas are all delicious, but don't be afraid to try the plethora of other options as well.For lunch, the place I have visited more than any other restaurant is Nick's, whose owner Nicolas spent many years living in Boston and has created a small sandwich and salad place with the best ingredients and a fun, chill atmosphere. The place is almost always full, whether for lunch or after work for a snack and drinks. You can also check out the recently opened Nick's 2 in Zona G that has an art gallery on the second floor.La Plaza de Andres is a great spot for lunch. It is basically a cafeteria with different stations (steak, chicken, burgers, fish, salads, juice bar, etc.). I normally get the rotisserie chicken, but you can't go wrong with anything there.SanaQueSana is my go-to place when I'm looking for a healthy lunch. I'd recommend trying the mero (grouper) and having something to drink from the juice bar.For quick tasty burgers, check out El Corral. It's the Colombian equivalent of McDonald's, but bigger, better, and fresher. I like the normal El Corral more than El Corral Gourmet, which reminds me of TGI Friday's or Chili's.Crepes & Waffles is also a Colombian favorite that you can find throughout the country. The crepes, salads and ice cream are all delicious.If you're getting tired of Latin American food and want something different, I really love the Korean food at Biwon. As a Korean food fanatic, I've yet to leave unsatisfied.Where to go for drinksThe most consistent place to grab a beer would be Irish Pub in Zona T. It is packed seven days a week. I'd also stop by one of the many Bogota Beer Company locations spread throughout the city, or if you're looking for a wide selection of international beers, check out The Monkey House. My favorite beer there is Kunstmann Torobayo from Chile.For good cocktails, go to La Destileria, Lipstick and Pravda; which are all close to Zona T; or Kong and Magnolio in Zona G.If you're looking a more lively atmosphere, I typically find myself going to Armando Records, Armando All Stars (same building, different floor), Hotel V (go to the top floor/terraza), or El Coq.As you probably noticed, I'm a big fan of Foursquare and used it for all of the locations in this article. Here is the list of all the places mentioned in the article.The majority of the places I named will have many pictures and tips to help you get a feel for the place. Most of the tips will be in Spanish, so pull out your dictionary, use Google Translate, or check out the restaurant on Trip Advisor. I left Bogota a few months ago to move to Medellin, so keep an eye out for a similar article soon entailing the highlights of the world's most innovative city."

""We had a big wedding. It was a big adjustment after that,"" she explained. ""Now I'm settled, and I think kids will come.""The 35-year-old added that she had a lot on her to-do list before expanding her family. ""I wanted to get my foundation launched.

We can't really be sure of that (though it would make the future child the perfect age for play dates with Kate Middleton's bun in the oven). The former Olympic swimmer has kept up quite the busy schedule, so we'll see if she slows down.Unfortunately, Charlene and Albert's marriage has been plagued by scandalous gossip since before their 2011 wedding. Press outlets reported that the princess had tried to run away multiple times after finding out that the prince had fathered two children, but she allegedly had her passport confiscated by the Principality of Monaco. There were also murmurings that the former Olympic swimmer would be allowed to leave the marriage once she gave Albert a child.

But it is still fun to fantasize about how great it would be to have a personal staff to take on all those tedious daily tasks, such as pouring one's own coffee or filling one's bathtub. While having a permanent live-in staff is not an option, many luxe hotels let you hang out with your very own butler while on vacation. What exactly do these folks do? A classic British hotel butler has been known to arrange a formal crystal-laden dinner and meet guests at the airport in a Rolls, while his Southern Californian counterpart will deal with all the surfing needs of a guest. And almost any butler worthy of his or her title will expertly unpack a pile of suitcases, customize a room and run the perfect bath. One other piece of good news -- the services of the hotel butler are usually included in the price of the room. It seems there is a butler service tailored to almost every location and type of traveler: The Umaid Bhawan Palace (Jodhpur, India) -- the hotel was originally built as a Maharaja palace and butlers are trained in giving every guest the royal treatment. Hotel butlers cover all the basics, but also escort guests on sightseeing trips around town with chilled drinks and samosas.One & Only Ocean Club (the Bahamas) -- butlers here embrace a Caribbean vibe as they drive around on golf carts to respond to a guest's every need. They wrap Christmas presents, drop the kids off at the kid's club, arrange golf outing, and personalize hotel suites with requested drinks.The Ritz Carlton Laguna Nigel (Dana Point, CA) -- if you are in Southern California, then the butler you need is obviously a beach butler. These butlers help you get your surf gear together, carry your beach bag down the bluff and will even build sand castles with the kids.The Lanesborough (London) -- a classic British experience. Butlers are uniformed in a morning suit and will greet you at the airport in the hotel's Rolls Royce Phantom. They will then unpack your bags and arrange for your favorite tea time treats to be served.Sandals Grande Riviera Beach & Villa Golf Resort (Jamaica) -- butlers in the All-Butler Riviera Villas can provide the Honeymoon crowd with anything that a new spouse is too dew-eyed to perform, such as arranging for a perfect romantic dinner or setting up a couples' massage.Jade Mountain (St. Lucia) -- Butlers in this luxury retreat are available 24 hours a day and can be summoned instantly using a ""Firefly"" wireless device. These butlers will set up breakfast in bed and candlelit dinners on the beach, as well as arrange for island tours and make sure your favorite cocktail is waiting for you in your room after a tough day at the spa.  Jumby Bay, A Rosewood Resort (Antigua) -- The best way to get around the resort is by bike, so of course a bike butler is provided to all guests. Your bike butler will outfit you with perfect bike, deliver it to your room, help you if you get a flat tire and help the junior set to customize their wheels with ribbons."
