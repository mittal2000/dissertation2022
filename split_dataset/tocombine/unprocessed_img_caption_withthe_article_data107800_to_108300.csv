0,POLITICS,U.S. Begins Enhanced Ebola Screening Program At JFK Airport,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ebola-us-airports_n_5969010.html,,2014-10-11,"An airport worker wears a protective face mask in the arrivals area of the Los Angeles International Airport as the US announced increased passenger screenings against the Ebola Virus on October 9, 2014. Five United States airports (although not LAX) will step-up airport screening measures to look for passengers carrying Ebola, as the deadly virus killed a man in Texas and the worldwide toll neared 3,900. The spillover of the virus with the first diagnosis in United States and the first case of infection in Spain has raised fears of contagion in the West. AFP PHOTO/Mark RALSTON (Photo credit should read MARK RALSTON/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d9333c000018010dfa1c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Sebastien MaloNEW YORK, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Stepped up efforts by the U.S. to halt the spread of the Ebola virus will start at New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport on Saturday, where teams armed with thermal guns and questionnaires will screen travelers from West African countries hit hardest by the outbreak.JFK Airport is the first of five U.S. airports to start enhanced screening of U.S.-bound travelers from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, where most of the outbreak's more than 4,000 deaths have occurred.Nearly all of those traveling to the United States from those countries arrive at JFK, Newark Liberty, Washington Dulles, Chicago O'Hare and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta. The new procedures will begin at the other four airports next week.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the airport screening is just one aspect of an overall strategy to fight the spread of Ebola.""Because we want to protect the American public, we are taking a tiered approach,"" said CDC spokesman Jason McDonald.But even before authorities start checking passengers for fevers, critics questioned whether the screenings would prove effective at stopping travelers infected with the often fatal Ebola virus from entering the country.JFK is the U.S. entry point for nearly half of the roughly 150 travelers who arrive daily from the three West African countries, and those flights amount to about one-tenth of 1 percent of all international daily arrivals to the airport, McDonald said.The Department of Homeland Security's Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will conduct the screenings under CDC direction, McDonald said.Using FDA-approved infrared temperature guns, the CBP staffers will check for elevated temperatures among passengers whose journeys began or included a stop in one of the three West African countries.Screeners will also assess passengers for signs of potential illness and ask them to answer questions about their health and whether they may have come into contact with an Ebola patient.Those with a fever or other symptoms or possible exposure to Ebola will be referred to the CDC, which will determine next steps. Health authorities may decide to take a person to a hospital for evaluation, testing and treatment, or to quarantine or isolate the patient under federal law, according to the CDC.""Breaking a federal quarantine order is punishable by fines and imprisonment,"" according to the CDC's website.But U.S. health authorities have never before used fever monitoring to screen travelers, said Lawrence Gostin, who teaches global health law at Georgetown Law School, and that monitoring didn't work well when used in Canada and Asia during the SARS outbreak in 2002.Fever-monitoring ""had virtually no effectiveness,"" he said. ""It is unlikely to keep us safe.""Taking over-the-counter medication during the flight can easily help travelers bring down a fever to evade detection, Gostin said. Passengers also could lie on questionnaires aimed at determining whether the traveler has been exposed to the deadly virus, said Dr. David Mabey, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine.""People may not fill them in very truthfully. They don't want to be delayed for hours,"" Mabey said.Passengers are already screened when they depart from the three West African countries. In the two months since those screenings began, only 77 of the 36,000 screened travelers were denied boarding, the CDC said. Many of them were diagnosed later with malaria, and none with Ebola.Thomas Eric Duncan, a Liberian national who died in Dallas this week, was able to fly to the United States from Liberia because he didn't have a fever when screened at the airport in the capital, Monrovia. And he filled out a questionnaire saying he had not been in contact with anyone infected with Ebola. Liberian officials have said Duncan lied on the questionnaire and had been in contact with a pregnant woman who later died.Both Mabey and Gostin said it was unlikely that a person who passed the temperature screening at departure time would develop a high fever during the plane ride to the United StatesBut Dr. Jeffrey Griffiths, who teaches about infectious disease at Tufts University School of Medicine, said the U.S. screenings ""will incrementally pick up some people"" and are a valuable tool to raise awareness that early detection and treatment are key to survival.""You want to convert yourself to a person who it's caught in early and increase your chances of making it,"" Griffiths said.

That would make Hudhud a Category 4 storm capable of inflicting ""catastrophic"" damage.Around 150,000 people have been evacuated in the coastal state of Andhra Pradesh to high-rise buildings, shelters and relief centers, said senior disaster management official Hymabati. A further 50,000 may still be moved to safety, she added.Authorities further north in Odisha state said they were monitoring the situation and would, if necessary, move 300,000 people most at risk to nearby shelters.""We have already shifted about 10,000 people from low-lying areas and plan to evacuate 14,000 more,"" N. Yubaraj, administrative chief of the coastal district of Visakhapatnam district, told Reuters.Visakhapatnam, also known as Vizag, is the largest city in Andhra Pradesh and hosts a major Indian naval base.In Pudimadaka, a coastal village where many are fishermen, locals have been reluctant to leave.""People are adamant. They are not willing to go. For the past three days we have been convincing them. Thank God. Now they agreed,"" Vasantha Rayudu, a local administrative officer, said while supervising the evacuation work.""We convinced the people after holding a series of discussions with the village elders,"" said Rayudu, sitting in a small room with dozens of officials and policemen as huge waves crashed on the coast few meters away.As a man beat a small drum and urged people by a loudspeaker to board nearby buses, tea seller V. Varalakshmi said she had packed her bags, but did not want to go.""For the past 14 years, I have been selling tea here, the sea has never caused any harm to us,"" the 52-year-old woman said as she served a customer.In New Delhi, India's Crisis Management Committee met to review readiness for the onslaught from Hudhud.""All the central agencies are fully geared up to provide necessary assistance,"" the government said in a statement, adding that 39 National Disaster Response Force teams had been deployed to the two states.Cyclones in the Bay of Bengal are common at this time of year. These often cause deaths, mass evacuations of coastal villages, disruption of power and phone services as well as damage to crops and property in eastern India and Bangladesh. HUMANITARIAN IMPACTHudhud was tracking west-northwest, 250 km (156 miles) southeast of Vizag at 2:30 pm on Saturday afternoon (1000 GMT), the IMD said.The cyclone was strong enough to have a ""high humanitarian impact"" on more than 7 million people, the GDACS said in an updated bulletin.The system also forecast a storm surge of 1.7 meters. The IMD said this could result in flooding of low-lying coastal areas around Visakhapatnam, Vijayanagaram and Srikakulam.The evacuation effort was comparable in scale to the one that preceded Cyclone Phailin exactly a year ago, and which was credited with minimizing the fatalities to 53. When a huge storm hit the same area 15 years ago, 10,000 people died.""Hudhud is now the size of Phailin, though not yet as strong,"" said Eric Holthaus, a U.S.-based meteorologist at online magazine Slate.""It's strengthened overnight, and most computer models are intent on bringing it up to nearly the same strength as Phailin was at landfall.""It's worrying that international agencies are rating Hudhud's current strength higher than IMD's peak forecast, but we can only hope that the evacuations under way are sufficient to protect those in the storm's path,"" Holthaus said.Authorities have been stocking cyclone shelters with dry rations, water purification tablets and generators. They have opened up 24-hour emergency control rooms and dispatched satellite phones to officials in charge of vulnerable districts.(Additional reporting by Nita Bhalla; Writing by Douglas Busvine; Editing by Malini Menon, Richard Borsuk and Stephen Powell)"

Terrorism, unrest and poverty effect badly education structure in Pakistan, especially the girls school and educational institutes are being targeted in North Western areas of Pakistan. According to a UNESCO report, the official statistics released by the Federal Education Ministry of Pakistan the overall literacy rate is 46 per cent, while only 26 per cent of girls are literate. In rural areas only one-in-three women have ever attended school. Poverty is also a big hurdle in girls' education. According to UNICEF, 17.6 per cent of Pakistani children are working to support their families.

Girls like Fatima, who dreams of being a scientist, so that her name can live forever through her experiments. Girls like Simrah, who dreams of being an Olympic swimmer, because training as an athlete has taught her that ""the only way for me is forward."" Girls like Areeba, who dreams of becoming a diplomat, saying ""If we believe in ourselves, everyone will believe in us."" Girls whose dreams -- and determination to pursue them -- reveal tremendous courage and resolve, in a world where seeking something better for themselves can literally put their lives at risk. Just as Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai has inspired us all with her fortitude, there are girls in cities, towns, and rural villages around the globe who are fighting for their own dangerous dreams. The dream of getting an education. The dream of marrying when they choose. The dream of controlling their bodies and their lives. The dream of becoming everything they know that they can be -- no matter the obstacles or risk.These are the girls -- and these are the dreams -- we celebrate on The International Day of the Girl, October 11, 2014. If we help more girls to realize their dreams, the impact will be transformative. When girls are empowered with education, health, and justice, they can drive extraordinary progress, raising up their communities and making the future brighter for us all.One of the most inspiring examples I know is 27-year old Humaira Bachal, who, like Malala, has been a leader for girls' education since she was a girl herself. Humaira grew up in a desperately poor neighborhood on the outskirts of Karachi in Pakistan. Even though her own father resisted her schooling, Humaira believed that education was the key to a better life -- and, crucially, her mother did too. At the age of 12, Humaira and a few of her friends started teaching other neighborhood children -- first out of her own home, and, as more and more students started attending, in space she rented as two makeshift classrooms, paid for out of her own pocket.Humaira was tireless in challenging long-established cultural practices, exhorting mothers not to pass on to their daughters the illiteracy, early marriage, and other injustices that they themselves had endured; and urging fathers to permit all their children to receive the education that is their birthright. By June 2013, she and her colleagues were educating roughly 1,200 girls and boys, and graduates of the program were taking the model to other communities as well. It was an incredible success story -- but Humaira's dreams were only getting bigger. She envisioned creating a modern school, complete with playground, library, and computers -- a place where local girls and boys could start to see the world beyond their horizon. At last summer's Sound of Change Live concert event, we shared Humaira's story with the world, with a screening of ""Humaira the Dreamcatcher"" by Oscar-winning filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid Chinoy. Madonna stepped forward with a major donation and challenged the Chime community to join her, which we made possible through crowdfunding technologies, using the power of social media for social change. Thanks to the overwhelming response, Humaira's Dream School was completed this summer. It has gone from a dream to a dream come true, and, in Humaira's words, the building itself ""stands as a very visible symbol of what a girl can achieve."" Humaira's Dream School is tangible proof that each of us can make a difference. But dreaming alone is not enough; we also have to act. Every one of us has a voice. Every one of us can make a contribution. You can find a place to participate, to speak out, to be a part of something bigger than yourself. We are defined by our actions. And those actions add up -- one person, one step, one dollar, one euro, one peso, one rial at a time -- as solitary voices become a movement of many, too powerful to ignore. But we must not wait. Because it isn't just about what we gain when we empower girls. It's also about how much society loses when we don't. How can Nigeria ever reach its full potential when schoolgirls, kidnapped in the dark of night, are still missing, more than five months later? How can Syria ever hope to rebuild itself when so many displaced women and girls are being brutalized and scarred by sexual violence, domestic abuse, and early marriage? How can any country secure lasting prosperity if it neglects or, worse, deliberately restrains the abilities of half its people? And how can any of us feel good about a world where girls face these kinds of injustices?The students at Humaira's school have a prayer: ""May my life be as bright as a burning candle."" On this International Day of the Girl, let us shelter and support young girls' dreams, and help those millions of tiny flames become a sun that lights the sky.

9,QUEER VOICES,7 Reasons We Love Matt Bomer,Curtis M. Wong,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/matt-bomer-birthday-_n_5954866.html,,2014-10-11,"Matt Bomer arrives at the 66th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards at the Nokia Theatre L.A. Live on Monday, Aug. 25, 2014, in Los Angeles. (Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafcefe24000050005517f4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's perhaps fitting that Matt Bomer's birthday coincides with National Coming Out Day. The Hollywood heartthrob, who turns 37 on Oct. 11, helped change the game -- as far as celebrity coming out stories are concerned -- by subtly acknowledging his husband, Simon Halls, and their three children in a 2012 acceptance speech. Relationships aside, Bomer remains a star on the rise based on sheer talent and charisma. The actor has kept us on the edge of our seats on USA's ""White Collar,"" stripped down with Channing Tatum and Joe Manganiello in ""Magic Mike"" and moved us to tears in ""The Normal Heart."" Check out seven great reasons we love Matt Bomer on his 37th birthday. 1. He's a loving and devoted husband.   In a 2014 interview with Details, Bomer revealed that he’s been married to Halls since 2011. “It was very chill,” he later told Out magazine of his nuptials. “There’s a security, a validity of knowing that it’s legal. It’s hard to put into words.” In 2012, the couple were presented with GLSEN’s 2012 Inspiration Award by Bomer's ""Magic Mike"" co-star Manganiello, who called the pair ""the example that the rest of our country needs."" And the pair remains committed: In January of this year, Bomer threw Halls, a longtime Hollywood publicist whom he's affectionally referred to as ""his smarter half"" and his inspiration, a 50th birthday party in Cabos San Lucas, Mexico with pals Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos. 2. He’s a family man.   In addition to Halls, Bomer referred to his three sons -- Kit, Walker (pictured) and Henry -- as his “proudest accomplishment” when accepting the New Generation Arts and Activist Award at the 2012 Steve Chase Humanitarian Awards, and has continued to gush about his kids in subsequent appearances and interviews. “There's a level of love that really dissolves a lot of egotism and self-absorption,"" he told Out magazine. ""But at a certain point in my life, my whole day would have been about this interview. Now, it's a small part of a day that also includes a drop-off at school in the morning and baseball practice and a lot of other things that take precedence."" 3. He's not afraid to take risks.   Bomer's seminal ""Normal Heart"" performance won him raves and an Emmy nod, but ""Heart"" playwright Larry Kramer wasn't convinced the actor was the best fit for Felix Turner, a closeted New York Times reporter who eventually dies of complications related to HIV/AIDS, at first. Though Kramer initially felt the hunky star was ""too beautiful"" for the role, Bomer eventually won the celebrated scribe over, getting into character by losing more than 40 pounds and isolating himself from his family. The result was a credible, stirring performance that is said to have left both the playwright and director Ryan Murphy in awe. ""You know you have to push yourself and stress your parameters as an actor and as an artist and dig deeper than maybe you had to before -- especially in this medium,"" Bomer told HIV Plus magazine at the time. 4. He can sing. Back when we were still watching ""Glee,"" Bomer was a pleasant surprise in a guest stint that involved him crooning Duran Duran and Gotye as Cooper Anderson, the adversarial older brother to Darren Criss's Blaine, on the hit show's third season. As it turns out, it wasn't Bomer's first musical turn. In 2010, he performed ""It Only Takes a Moment"" from ""Hello, Dolly!"" alongside Tony-nominated Broadway actress Kelli O'Hara as part of a tribute to composer Jerry Herman at the Kennedy Center Honors. Given those vocal chops, we're rooting for Bomer (who's no stranger to the stage) to be cast as the leading man in a full-scale Broadway musical! 5. He's gracious.   In 2012, American Psycho author Bret Easton Ellis slammed the possible casting of Bomer as Christian Grey in the film version of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" as ""absolutely ludicrous"" because the actor is openly gay. ""I think Matt Bomer is incredibly handsome and a good actor but I think he comes off totally gay,"" Ellis wrote on Twitter. The role, he added, ""demands an actor that is genuinely into women.""Despite fan support for Bomer's casting, the role eventually went to Jamie Dornan. Not that Bomer is bitter, of course, telling ET Online at the time that he was “so grateful for the fans and touched."" 6. He's remarkably modest.   Bomer may be a dashing leading man who can pull off a G-string, but that doesn't mean he's banking totally on his looks. ""In terms of aesthetics, though, yeah, I think there can be a perception that your sense of depth or personal history is light or incredibly easy,"" he told The Daily Beast. ""But I can safely say that I had an incredibly difficult and trying past growing up and trying to be an artist and standing up as who I am in this world... You have more to bring the table than how you’re perceived aesthetically.7. He remains a staunch advocate for LGBT rights, and has never dismissed the significance of being an out actor.   His subtle coming out speech garnered praise from fellow actors and LGBT rights advocates. ""I had somebody from the military approach me a few weeks ago just saying how this helps people, affects people. It brought me to tears,"" he told E! Online at the time. As far as LGBT youth is concerned, he added, ""They need saving, certainly in this day and age as much as ever—no matter how much we think we've progressed.""""Equality comes from treating everybody the same regardless of who they are,"" Bomer, who also starred in readings of Dustin Lance Black's ""8,"" about California's voter-approved ban on same-sex marriage, said.

(AP Photo/HBO, Janet Van Ham)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7f0ee240000300098acd0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Bill Maher's polemics about Islam have made a lot of headlines lately. While sitting as a guest on Maher's HBO show Real Time, film star Ben Affleck suggested that Maher was being racist. Maher's emphatic obsession with Islam as the target of his more broadly atheist polemics may qualify as bigotry, but it was perhaps Reza Aslan, a scholar of religions, who more carefully captured the source of Maher's problem. Dr. Aslan simply observed, ""When it comes to the topic of religion, [Maher is] not very sophisticated.""Maher and fellow ""new atheist"" guest Sam Harris both tend to fail to understand the difference between literalist religion and religion as it is practiced. Looking at any religious text from the Abrahamic faiths, it isn't difficult to find revolting and seemingly ""backwards"" ideas within their pages. Unsurprisingly, ethical codes that date back to anywhere from 1,400 years ago to over 3,000 years ago are more than a little out of date. What Maher, Harris and many others like them fail to realize is that religion as it is practiced is a product of a wide array of factors, the official texts being only one of them.Their confusion is understandable. Technically, religions allege that their holy texts are timeless sources of moral guidance, lessons, and principles. In reality they have proven to be highly contextual and relative ""guidelines"" on how to engage in faith-compliant behavior. The Hadith does indeed propose that the penalty for apostasy be death, as Maher noted. The Bible says more or less the same but leaves it to God to handle the dirty work on Judgment Day. According to the book of Revelations in the New Testament of the Bible, the only unforgivable sin is the rejection of Christ. According to the text around which Christian theology is built, apostasy is a crime that ranks above gang rape and mass murder in inviting God's wrath. The Torah permits slavery and the stoning of adulterers. Unsurprisingly, most Jews today don't actually find those practices acceptable. Indeed, it would be fair to suggest that claiming that such verses are a sound basis for judging and engaging with Jews verges on anti-Semitism.Maher likes to claim that statistics prove he's right. One of the most famous sets of statistics on the matter that Maher discusses comes from the Pew Forum. If you take Muslims alone, their views may, at times, appear shockingly conservative to Westerners. This is, of course unsurprising, given that most of the world's Muslims do not live in the most liberal and secular parts of the world. The views of many non-Western populations are ""inadequately"" liberal to most Westerners. Interestingly, the Pew Forum did discover one thing in its most recent survey of the world's Muslims that is worth paying attention to:American Muslims are somewhat less likely to believe in evolution than are Muslims in other parts of the world (45% vs. global median of 53%). Indeed, when it comes to evolution, U.S. Muslims are closer to U.S. Christians (46% of whom say they believe in evolution) than they are to fellow Muslims elsewhere in the world.It appears that living in the United States, with its high level of skepticism regarding evolution amongst religious Christians, actually resulted in American Muslims being less likely to believe in evolution than their fellow Muslims abroad. What this suggests is that where you live has more influence over what you believe than does what your religious text tells you to believe. This should hardly surprise a sophisticated nonbeliever who understands that humans are largely a product of their context, but new atheists do seem to fail to grasp this.If one looks at the Pew Forum's comparative study of tolerance amongst Muslims and Christians in sub-Saharan Africa, it becomes more apparent how much more important social context is than formal religious affiliations in structuring people's views on morality. The survey found that where someone lives is a far more effective predictor of one's views on the acceptability of abortion than is the religion they belong to. In Cameroon 95 percent of the population believes abortion is morally wrong. Taken separately, 95 percent of Christians and 95 percent of Muslims in Cameroon hold that view. In Mozambique 76 percent of people see abortion as morally wrong. Taken separately, 76 percent of Christians and 75 percent of Muslims see abortion as morally wrong.On homosexuality, the same trend emerges. In Cameroon 98 percent of the overall population, including 98 percent of Christians and 99 percent of Muslims, see homosexuality as immoral. In Mozambique it's 80 percent of the overall population, including 80 percent of Christians and 79 percent of Muslims.The point here is not that there isn't a problem with religious freedom in many Muslim-majority countries but that their being Muslim is not the primary reason for that problem, and that people of any faith are more shaped by the norms of their cultural context, interpreting their religious texts to comport with those norms rather than the other way around.The simple reality is that religion isn't the most relevant variable in forming people's sense of morality or even their behavior. If you look at the polls in context, you discover that where you live often has far stronger predictive power than the faith you subscribe to in terms of your views on morality. Your social context is more influential than a 1,400-, 2,000- or 3,000-plus-year-old book.CORRECTION: The proposal that death be the penalty for apostasy by Muslims lies not in the Quran, as this post originally stated, but in the Hadith. The post has been updated accordingly."
11,SPORTS,5 Small Moves That Paid Off BIG For The Orioles,Michael Klopman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baltimore-orioles-moves-dan-duquette_n_5945376.html,,2014-10-11,"Baltimore Orioles Executive Vice-President of Baseball Operations Dan Duquette, right, shakes hands with Nelson Cruz tafter introducing him to the media during a news conference at the Ed Smith Stadium complex before the team's baseball spring training workout in Sarasota, Fla., Tuesday, Feb. 25, 2014. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb76fac250000360039e6b7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For the Baltimore Orioles, it has been about ""opportunity"" all season long. The team found itself four wins from the World Series because the players on the field, the manager in the dugout and the executives in the front office made the most of so many of the opportunities presented to them. Beginning in spring training, Baltimore manager Buck Showalter has used that other O-word when talking about his Orioles. With his roster taking shape in Sarasota, Fla., he boasted of the club's willingness to give players the chance to show they could contribute. Several months and 100 wins later, the 58-year-old skipper talked about how his squad had ""won an opportunity"" by earning a spot in the American League Championship Series.""We may not be able to outdo in some other areas, but we can 'outopportunity' people,"" Showalter said of his team's penchant for giving players a chance to succeed in different roles after their three-game sweep of Detroit in the ALDS. ""A lot of guys took an opportunity and ran with it, so they're going to get a chance to continue to roll the dice.""Perhaps more important to the Orioles' successes than the players who ran with those opportunities were the decision makers -- notably general manager Dan Duquette -- who brought them to Baltimore. Here are just a few of the moves, some that seemed quite small at the time they were made, that have paid off in a big way for the O's as they earned a berth in the ALCS for the first time since 1997:Signing Nelson Cruz: The most important offseason move the Orioles made came late when they signed Nelson Cruz to a one-year, $8 million contract in February. Many teams seemed to be passing on Cruz as he was coming off a 2013 season in which he was suspended 50 games as part of the Biogenesis performance-enhancing drug scandal. He proved to be perhaps the best bargain of the offseason, slugging 40 homers (most in the majors) and recording 108 RBI in 2014. He also continued his dominance of the Detroit Tigers in the postseason, batting .500 with two crucial home runs as the O's completed a three-game ALDS sweep. Acquiring Alejandro De Aza: - On August 31, the Orioles dealt a pair of minor leaguers to the Chicago White sox for left-handed outfielder Alejandro De Aza. With Chicago, De Aza was batting .243 and had a .309 on-base percentage in 2014. In 20 regular-season games with the O's, he batted .293 and had a .341 OBP. He was 3 for 8 with two RBI in the ALDS. Bringing Back Steve Pearce: Utility player Steve Pearce was designated for assignment on April 22, giving the Orioles 10 days to either trade, release or put him through waivers. The team then put him on unconditional release waivers, per the Baltimore Sun. The Toronto Blue Jays claimed Pearce, but he rejected the claim to become a free agent. With a void at first base after Chris Davis suffered an oblique injury, the Orioles quickly re-signed Pearce. In 120 games for the Orioles in 2014, Pearce hit 21 homers and drove in 49 runs. Making Zach Britton The Permanent Closer - With Baltimore's opening-day closer Tommy Hunter struggling and injured in May, the team was expected to go with a closer-by-committee. When Hunter eventually returned from the disabled list, O's manager Buck Showalter chose not to give him a chance to earn his job back, sticking with Zach Britton as his closer. Britton, who did not have a single career save entering the 2014 campaign and was coming off a lackluster 2013 season that included a trip to the instructional league in September, recorded 37 saves in 41 opportunities as the O's won the AL East.Platooning Caleb Joseph/Nick Hundley - When All-Star catcher Matt Wieters went down in May with an elbow injury that would require Tommy John surgery, the Orioles called up Caleb Joseph from Triple-A and traded for Nick Hundley to fill his gear. While their batting averages aren't much to brag about, the platoon provided timely hitting while Joseph recorded a caught stealing percentage of 40. Acquiring Delmon Young - Some questioned the Orioles for acquiring Delmon Young in January. Nobody is questioning the move now. Young went 10 for 20 this season as a pinch-hitter with a homer and five RBI. Overall, he batted .302 and hit seven homers in 2014. In Game 2 of the ALDS against the Detroit Tigers, he delivered a bases-loaded, pinch-hit double to give the Orioles a 7-6 lead in the eighth inning. Trading For Reliever Andrew Miller - The Orioles were relatively quiet at the non-waiver trade deadline, only trading a pitching prospect to Boston for reliever Andrew Miller. The move has done wonders for Baltimore's bullpen. In just 20 regular season innings with the O's, Miller struck out 34 batters and only gave up three earned runs. In the ALDS, he struck out three in 3.1 innings without giving up a run. "

""I'm very excited about it. I'm not sure when it'll happen, but I'm in the process of [working on it].""Written by Cushman, the 1994 novel -- which won the Newbury Prize in 1995 -- tells the story of Catherine, a 12-year-old coming of age in 1290 England. ""[She] gets her period and her father basically says, 'Well, it's time for you to get married,' and she's like, 'Uh, no,'"" Dunham told the crowd. ""But it's hyper realistic and really pretty and it's full of incest and beatings, but it's a child's story. I've been obsessed with it since I was a kid."" Dunham previously cited ""Catherine, Called Birdy"" as one of the two best books she's ever read about young girls in an interview with the New York Times in 2012. (Her other selection was Vladimir Nabokov's ""Lolita."")""It's a really interesting examination of sort of like coming of age and what's expected of teenage girls,"" Dunham said. ""I'm going to adapt it and hopefully direct it, I just need to find someone who wants to fund a PG-13 medieval movie."" Dunham plans to produce the film through A Casual Romance, the production company she started with ""Girls"" executive producer Jenni Konner. According the 28-year-old, ""Catherine, Called Birdy"" is one of many projects the duo are working on at the moment ""that sort of aren't set in the here and now.""""Nothing I've done so far has required any research of any real kind beyond, like, going to a diner,"" Dunham said, acknowledging how ""Catherine, Called Birdy"" is not necessarily what some fans have come to expect from her as a writer-director. ""So this is a whole other world. But the source material makes me so happy and I'm so excited, because I've been working on 'Girls' [for five years] and I also wrote this book of personal essays. So the idea of engaging with some of these topics that are important to me, which are -- surprise -- women and feminism, but finding a way to kind of look at them through a historical lens is sort of like where feel myself going.""Dunham, who is currently promoting her new book, ""Not That Kind of Girl,"" said she'll connect with Cushman to discuss ""Catherine, Called Birdy"" during a visit to Seattle next weekend."

Scores more brought tents, foam and ground sheets to form a kind of sprawling urban campground hemmed in by towering skyscrapers.""Hong Kong is my home, we are fighting for Hong Kong's future, our future,"" said Lawrence Chan, a 23-year-old media studies student, who has taken part in the protests from the outset.Hong Kong Chief Secretary Carrie Lam, who announced the postponement of talks with the students on Thursday because of their persistent calls to escalate action, said on Saturday that she hadn't given up hope of getting them on track again.""It's most important that we must make clear the aim and nature of the meeting,"" she told reporters during a weekend trip to China, stressing that the dialog should center on Beijing's proposed framework for electoral reform in 2017.Since taking to the streets around two weeks ago, the activists have blocked major roads around the government precinct in Admiralty, as well as the shopping districts of Central and Causeway Bay.At Friday's rallies, protest leaders urged demonstrators to prepare for a protracted struggle instead of expanding the protests geographically. The protests have led to some resentment among the public because of traffic jams and loss of business. A few street fights have broken out that pitted the students against anti-occupy mobs and local gangsters or triads.It was unclear how long Hong Kong authorities will tolerate the occupation or how the standoff might be resolved. For now, however, police presence remains thin with authorities seemingly reluctant to risk fresh flare-ups.Riot police had cracked down on protesters massing near the government headquarters on Sept. 28, but the authorities have taken a softer line since. Police on Saturday again warned the protesters to leave.Over one hundred colorful tents were sprinkled across the eight-lane Harcourt Road highway, among scores of red and blue portable marquees serving as supply and first aid stations; stocked with water, biscuits, noodles and cereals.""We have tents here to show our determination that we're prepared for a long-term occupation,"" said Benny Tai, one of the leaders of the movement, who emerged bleary-eyed from a tent pitched outside the Hong Kong government's headquarters.Scores of people ran a marathon in support of the students early on Saturday, and bridges remained festooned with umbrellas, protest art demanding full democracy and satirical images lampooning Leung Chun-ying, the city's Beijing-backed leader.The atmosphere was perhaps at its most relaxed since the Occupation movement began. Students, families and snap-happy tourists strolled along Harcourt Road, folding yellow paper origami umbrellas and penning colorful democracy missives.Those notes have filled an entire covered walkway outside government headquarters christened the ""Lennon"" wall as a tribute to John Lennon.Other studied and typed in an open-air classroom at makeshift desks with power sockets set up on the highway, while others gathered to hear and join stump speeches on democracy.The 'Occupy Central' protests, referring to the Central business district, was an idea conceived over a year ago. It has presented Beijing with one of its biggest political challenges since it crushed pro-democracy demonstrations in and around Tiananmen Square in the Chinese capital in 1989.^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>Graphic http://graphics.thomsonreuters.com/14/hk/index.html^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^>NO SIMPLE WAY OUTIn the first direct public comments by a senior Chinese leader in response to the protests, Premier Li Keqiang said Hong Kong authorities had the ability to protect the city's economic prosperity and social stability.""Maintaining the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong is not only in China's interests but is mostly in the interests of the people of Hong Kong,"" Li said in Germany on Friday.Since Britain handed back control in 1997, China has ruled Hong Kong through a ""one country, two systems"" formula which allows wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms not enjoyed on the mainland and specifies universal suffrage as an eventual goal.The Communist Party leadership has dismissed the Hong Kong protests as illegal and has left Leung to find a solution.The Hong Kong Federation of Students urged President Xi Jinping in an open letter to allow full democracy in Hong Kong in what would be a ""pioneering achievement"" for him. Beijing fears that calls for democracy in Hong Kong could spread to the mainland, with China already facing separatist unrest in Tibet and Xinjiang.Leung has so far ignored the demand by the protesters for full democracy and their calls for him to quit. Earlier this week, some lawmakers demanded that anti-graft officers investigate a $6.4 million business payout to Leung.The leader of Hong Kong's largest pro-Beijing political party, Tam Yiu-chung, conceded after a late meeting with Leung that while the protests should be cleared as soon as possible: ""It is not a simple thing and it is not a ripe time now.""

Tesla will build the worlds largest lithium-ion battery plant in Nevada, bringing a $100 billion boost to the states economy over two decades, Governor Brian Sandoval said.

Tesla’s chief executive announced the faster and all-wheel-drive version of the Model S electric sedan late Thursday night at Hawthorne Municipal Airport, just outside of Los Angeles. While the new model does not have the self-driving capability that had been rumored, it does pack a lot more power and several features sure to please prospective drivers.Engadget tweeted photos of the new model from the event.The D will be able to accelerate to 60 miles per hour in just over 3 seconds thanks to its dual motors, making it one of the fastest-accelerating sedans ever, Engadget reported. Musk said, ""The 'D' stands for dual,"" according to KCBS. It will also have a longer range of travel on a single charge, 275 miles, an increase of 10 miles from its rear-wheel drive models. Other features of The D include a system that can change lanes for the driver when prompted by a turn signal, and a computer that reads speed-limit signs and sets the car speed accordingly. The autopilot will even enable the car to park itself after the driver hops out, Mashable notes. The safety features are enabled by a network of 12 sensors that monitor the car's environment for assisting the driver in spotting pedestrians and moving in reverse. Musk said of the suite of driver-aid features, ""It's like active safety [within] the limit"" of affordable science and regulations, NBC News reported.Business Insider reported that there will be three versions of The D, each with a different size battery. The top model of the D fleet, the AD P85D, is expected to start shipping in December, followed by other models in February.Musk had teased the event last week when he posted a cryptic tweet promising to “unveil the D and something else.” Theories about what he would reveal abounded. The tweet alone caused the company's stock to climb 6 percent -- a roughly $2 billion value. An all-wheel drive version of the Model S, the company’s flagship car, had been in the works since late last year. It was rumored that this would be the focus of Musk's announcement after a photo of a black-colored copy of the car emblazoned with the nomenclature P85D leaked on a Tesla Motors Club forum. “I have heard some people in cooler climates question the handling,” Carter Driscoll, a senior analyst of clean technology at investment bank MLV & Co., told The Huffington Post hours before the event on Thursday. Tesla has been popular in chillier climates. Last year, the company made Norway the focus of its European expansion and the country quickly became the carmaker’s largest overseas market. Tesla has sold an average of 436 Model S sedans per month for the past year, according to data cited by International Business Times from OFV, Norway’s automotive industry association. In March, Tesla broke Norway's all-time record for monthly sales of a single model car. But sales of the car in the U.S. slumped for much of 2014 while other electric car sales remained stagnant. That fueled fears that the electric car craze was fizzling out. And though sales soared back to about 2,500 units last month, according to estimates by the electric car site InsideEVs, the Model S still trailed its main competitor, the Nissan LEAF. InsideEVs estimates Tesla's monthly U.S. sales by reconciling quarterly totals from earnings reports. Driscoll said Musk likely drummed up excitement for the all-wheel drive announcement to accelerate sales and burnish the reputation of the Model S -- as of now Tesla’s sole product for sale -- as an innovative, evolving vehicle. “Anything that continues to support that this is the best electric vehicle on the road today is clearly the near-term focus,” Driscoll said. “They want to continue to generate buzz about this great vehicle and that it’s continuing to move forward, it’s not a stagnant vehicle.”"
