The Twitter account for the three-day festival shared the news the day after Harris suffered minor injuries in a car wreck. The pop rock band Panic at the Disco is set to perform in the DJ's place. PREVIOUSLY: Calvin Harris was injured in a car accident in Los Angeles on Friday night, according to a statement on his Facebook page. The 32-year-old was rushed to hospital with a laceration on his face, TMZ reports. The DJ was on his way to the airport when a VW bug reportedly carrying a group of teenagers crossed the center line and collided with Harris' Cadillac SUV around 11 p.m. The crash was ""so violent"" that one of the passengers in the VW was ejected from the vehicle and broke her pelvis, according to TMZ. Paramedics took Harris to a Los Angeles hospital to treat his wound, but he reportedly left the premises soon after. He was set to perform at his regular gig in Las Vegas at the OMNIA nightclub, where he and girlfriend Taylor Swift danced the night away in March. The Huffington Post has contacted Harris' representatives for comment."

4,THE WORLDPOST,Afghan Government Confirms Death Of Taliban Leader,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/us-airstrike-taliban-leader_us_5740c5a8e4b045cc9a7130c2,The Taliban have made no official statement but two commanders close to Mansour denied he was dead.,2016-05-21,"An Afghan man reads a local newspaper with photos of the leader of the Afghan Taliban, Mullah Akhtar Mansoor, in Kabul in December 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The United States has killed the leader of the Afghan Taliban in an air strike in a remote border area just inside Pakistan, Afghanistan said on Sunday, in an attack likely to dash any immediate prospect for peace talks.The death of Mullah Akhtar Mansour could trigger a battle for succession and deepen fractures that emerged in the insurgent movement after the death of its founder, Mullah Mohammad Omar, was confirmed last year, more than two years after he died.Saturday's strike, which U.S. officials said was authorised by President Barack Obama and included multiple drones, showed the United States was prepared to go after the Taliban leadership in Pakistan, which the Western-backed government in Kabul has repeatedly accused of sheltering the insurgents.It also underscored the belief among U.S. commanders that under Mansour's leadership, the Taliban have grown increasing close to militant groups like al Qaeda, posing a direct threat to U.S. security.The United States has not confirmed Mansour's death but Afghan government chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah, and the country's top intelligence agency, said he had been killed.""Taliban leader Akhtar Mansour was killed in a drone strike ... His car was attacked in Dahl Bandin,"" Abdullah said in a post on Twitter, referring to a district in Pakistan's Baluchistan province just over the border with Afghanistan.U.S Secretary of State John Kerry said the United States had conducted a precision air strike that targeted Mansour ""in a remote area of the Afghanistan-Pakistan border"".Mansour posed a ""continuing, imminent threat"" to U.S. personnel and Afghans, Kerry told a news conference while on a visit to Myanmar.""If people want to stand in the way of peace and continue to threaten and kill and blow people up, we have no recourse but to respond and I think we responded appropriately,"" Kerry said.The Taliban have made no official statement but two commanders close to Mansour denied he was dead.With the report of Mansour's death, attention has focused on his deputy, Sirajuddin Haqqani, leader of a notorious network blamed for most big suicide attacks in Kabul.""Based purely on matters of hierarchy, he would be the favourite to succeed Mansour,"" said Michael Kugelman, a senior associate at the Woodrow Wilson Institute think-tank.Haqqani, appointed as number two after Mansour assumed control of the Taliban last year, has generally been seen as opposed to negotiations.Efforts to broker talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban had already stalled following a suicide attack in Kabul last month that killed 64 people and prompted President Ashraf Ghani to prioritize military operations over negotiations.Ghani's office said on Sunday Taliban who wanted to end bloodshed should return from ""alien soil"" and join peace efforts.'PANIC AMONG FOLLOWERS'Kerry said the leaders of both Pakistan and Afghanistan were notified of the Saturday air strike but he declined to say if they were told before or after it had been carried out. He said he had spoken to Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif by telephone.Pakistan has in the past denounced U.S. strikes on its soil, calling them a violation of sovereignty, but U.S. officials have said Pakistan has approved some strikes, in particular on militants fighting the Pakistani state.Pakistan, which has been trying to broker Afghan talks, was ""seeking clarification"" on the strike, a foreign ministry spokesman said. He repeated a call for the Taliban to shun violence and join negotiations.Drones targeted Mansour and another combatant in a vehicle in a remote area of Baluchistan, southwest of the town of Ahmad Wal, a U.S. official in Washington said, speaking on condition of anonymity.A Pakistani official in the area said a car had been blown up and two unidentified people had been killed. It was not clear how the vehicle was blown up and the two bodies had been taken to a hospital, said the official, who declined to be identified.One of the Taliban commanders who dismissed the report of Mansour's killing said it had nevertheless spread alarm.""This rumour has created panic among our followers across Afghanistan and Pakistan,"" the senor Taliban member said by telephone, adding he was telling his comrades to ignore the report.In December, Mansour was reportedly wounded and possibly killed in a shootout at the house of an insurgent leader in Pakistan. The Taliban eventually released an audio recording, purportedly from Mansour, to dispel the reports.A U.S. intelligence analyst said Mansour had been in a power struggle with another commander whose deputy was killed last year in what officials think was a fight with Mansour's faction.But the U.S. official cautioned against concluding that a shakeup might diminish the Taliban's broader sense of strength, given recent gains they had made.""It's hard to see much incentive for them to start compromising now, with the fighting just heating up again,"" the official said."

Putting them together? Well, that’s just unspeakably terrifying.Passengers flying on Air Transat from the Punta Cana, Dominican Republic, to Montreal, had to face two tarantulas running loose in the aircraft in April.Now, passenger Catherine Moreau is asking for a partial refund for her family’s tickets, though Canadian news reports haven’t specified the exact amount she’s seeking.“I was wearing a skirt and a spider crawled up my leg,” she said in a French-language Radio-Canada interview, as translated by The Guardian. “It was during the meal. My husband managed to catch the spider in a plastic container, but it wriggled its legs out. My daughter was crying, she was in shock.” Flight attendants captured one spider, but the other remained on the loose until the plane landed.Entomologist Etienne Normandin told the CBC that the spiders were likely a species called Phormictopus cancerides that's common in the Dominican Republic and Haiti. He suspects someone brought them in a carry-on in order to later sell them as pets.It’s legal to import live spiders into Canada, though the country requires people to report what the are bringing, according to Radio Canada. It’s unclear what Air-Transat's policy on transporting arachnids is, and the company did not immediately respond to The Huffington Post's query about the rules.Flight attendants “did what they could to calm people down,” Julie Roberts, vice-president of Air Transat’s flight attendant union, told the CBC.But even so, Moreau said that her daughter has had continued nightmares (and now we are, too) and that the airline failed to send her a report identifying the spiders species, in case she suffered any subsequent health issues from the arachnid scratching her. Air Transat is not commenting on that allegation, spokeswoman Debbie Cabana told HuffPost. But she did tell the CBC that staff “reacted promptly and efficiently” and that in the future, they’ll be prepared with a “clear procedure.”A spokesperson told the Guardian that the event was “extraordinary and isolated.” (That’s obviously true, but these events aren’t totally unheard of. Last year, Delta grounded a flight from Baltimore to Atlanta after a baboon tarantula got loose in the cargo hold.)It’s unclear what fate ultimately befell the tarantulas. We hope they’re OK."

""The horse has been training phenomenally.""I did what I could to get him happy and fresh and strong and I've always said he's had a great ability to recover and he showed it today.""Nyquist trainer Doug O'Neill was gracious in defeat.""Hats off to Exaggerator and Team Desormeaux. What a great run,"" said O'Neill. ""I didn't think we could get beat, to be honest with you. Nyquist is such an amazing horse. He still ran a great race.""Exaggerator, the second choice among bettors, paid $7.20 $3.20 and $2.40 for a $2 bet.Cherry Wine returned $9.80 $4.20, while Nyquist paid $2.20 for third place.The third leg of the Triple Crown series will be in the Belmont Stakes in New York on June 11.(Reporting by Larry Fine in New York; Editing by Mark Lamport-Stokes)CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified Nyquist's trainer as George O'Neill, not Doug O'Neill.

During that 1832 gathering, the party, then known as ""Republican Delegates from the Several States"" officially became known as the Democratic Party, according to the Library of Congress.Much has changed since then. As we prepare for the 47th convention July 25-28 in Philadelphia, here's a look at some of the most interesting changes and historic moments over the years.1835 (Baltimore): The second convention was held only three years after the first. It occurred one and a half years before the 1836 election to dissuade potential opponents to Vice President Martin Van Buren, who was President Andrew Jackson's hand-picked successor.1840 (Baltimore): This was the first Democratic convention that adopted a party platform. It included language about the role of the Constitution and states' rights, declared that slavery was an issue for states to decide and opposed creation of a national bank.1852 (Baltimore): The nomination balloting lasted two days and stretched to 49 ballots, resulting in the coronation of Franklin Pierce, who had agreed to throw his hat in the ring if there were a deadlock.1856 (Cincinnati): The seventh Democratic convention was the first not held in Baltimore.1860 (Charleston, South Carolina): The convention ran for 11 days but ended without any nominations after a number of Southern delegates left because of a dispute over the party's slavery platform. Less than two-thirds of the original delegates reconvened in Baltimore the next month to select nominees, and the Southern Democrats who had walked out met later to choose their own nominees.1872 (Baltimore): The Democratic Party didn't nominate its own candidate this year, but rather endorsed the presidential and vice presidential candidates of the Liberal Republican Party, in a move aimed at defeating President Ulysses S. Grant. (He won re-election anyway.) The convention lasted just six hours, though that was spread over two days.1896 (Chicago): William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska roused the crowd, delivering a ferocious attack on the gold standard that is remembered as one of the greatest political speeches of all time. ""You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold,"" he roared. He secured the presidential nomination on the fifth ballot the following day.1900 (Kansas City, Missouri): The first woman delegate, Elizabeth M. Cohen of Utah, appeared at the convention.1924 (New York City): The 16-day convention was the longest in American history. Delegates voted in 103 ballots before deciding on the presidential nominee.1932 (Chicago): Traditionally, the party nominee waited at home to be informed of the nomination -- and sometimes didn't hear the news until weeks later. But Franklin D. Roosevelt flew from New York to deliver an acceptance speech at this convention. In his speech, he spoke of a ""new deal"" with proposals to reduce unemployment.1936 (Philadelphia): Roosevelt once again appeared at the convention. He pushed for a rules change so the nominee needed only a majority of the delegates as opposed to two-thirds.1948 (Philadelphia): Disagreement over the party's position on civil rights led the Mississippi delegation and part of the Alabama delegation to withdraw from the convention. The departed delegates later met with other Southern Democrats to form the States' Rights Party and select their own presidential candidate.1964 (Atlantic City, New Jersey): Mississippi's delegation to the convention consisted of only white delegates since African-Americans were blocked from registering to vote in Mississippi. The Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party sent an integrated delegation to protest this. Two at-large seats were offered to that delegation as a compromise.1968 (Chicago): Riots raged outside the convention, fueled by anger with President Lyndon Johnson's Vietnam War strategy and the recent assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy. Also this year, a rule change allowed delegations to split their votes among candidates for the first time. 1980 (New York City): A rule up for a vote at the 1980 convention bound delegates to vote for the candidates they were pledged to via primaries and caucuses on the first ballot. However, Sen. Edward Kennedy, who was running for the nomination, tried to prevent this rule from being adopted. When Kennedy's attempt failed, he removed his name as a potential nominee.1984 (San Francisco): This was the first convention in which superdelegates played a part, making up about 14 percent of the ballots with party leaders and elected officials. The vice presidential pick, Geraldine Ferraro, was the first woman on the ticket of either major party.2008 (Denver): Barack Obama became the first African-American presidential nominee from a major party. 2016 (Philadelphia): This year is seeing one of the most contested primaries in several decades. What's in store for the convention?CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post, citing a short history of conventions provided by the Library of Congress, stated the first women delegates appeared at the 1908 convention. Elizabeth M. Cohen actually served as a delegate in 1900. She was originally elected as an alternate but stepped up when another delegate couldn't attend."

""He had no infirmities in his legs. He was just in such good health, you know?"" Tragedy struck again soon after.Pramedya, owned by Roy and Gretchen Jackson of Lael Stables, broke her leg during the fourth race and fell to the muddy track. The four-year-old filly was euthanized on the track. Pramedya’s jockey, Daniel Centeno, broke his right collarbone in the fall and was taken to Sinai Hospital.The death of Pramedya comes 10 years after Kentucky Derby winner Barbaro, another Lael Stables horse, suffered life-ending injuries at the Preakness. Barbaro broke his right hind leg during the race and died after months of failed treatment.Racehorse deaths are not an anomaly. The cardiovascular strain of the sprints and the susceptibility of horses' delicate legs result in many injuries. Twenty-four horses die each week at U.S. racetracks, according to a 2012 New York Times report. Following Saturday's deaths, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals demanded the release of the horses’ medical records.""Studies -- and our own investigations -- have shown that most breakdowns and deaths occur because horses have pre-existing injuries that are masked by the excessive use of legal medications. We want to know if that is what happened in the cases of Pramedya and Homeboykris,"" PETA senior vice president Kathy Guillermo said in a statement. ""In today's racing drug culture, at least three horses are dying every day on U.S. tracks. The foolish use of muscle relaxants, anti-inflammatory drugs, and other medications must end now.""CORRECTION: This article has been updated to reflect that Barbaro broke his right hind leg, not two legs."

13,ENTERTAINMENT,We Finally Understand The Most Awkward Relationship On 'Modern Family',Sara Boboltz,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/phil-gloria-modern-family_us_573f2a9ee4b00e09e89ed1ac,It only took seven seasons.,2016-05-21,"Sofia Vergara, left, as Gloria Pritchett and Ty Burrell, right, as Phil Dunphy.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573f2cc51a00008800c292de.png?cache=frjInR4zBT&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Non-traditional relationships are standard fare on “Modern Family,” a show that introduced network television to a May-December romance that blended three families across generational lines ― one including two fathers. Still, while the show’s writers weave jokes out of the fabric of those relationships, they are careful to be sure none of their non-traditional pairings are actually cringeworthy. That is, except for one: Phil Dunphy (Ty Burrell) and Gloria Pritchett (Sofia Vergara). Phil’s step-mother-in-law, Gloria, and Phil’s wife, Claire (Julie Bowen), are approximately the same age. And he’s has been noticeably into to Gloria throughout the show, revealing his attraction in the manner of a teenager poisoned by hormones: through awkward social blunders. “Phil had a hard time even just carrying on a conversation because he was so beguiled by her beauty,” Burrell told The Huffington Post, comparing his character to “a fish seeing something shiny.” Although Gloria appears oblivious, her much-older husband, Jay (Ed O’Neill), is not so naive. Still, he seems to operate under the assumption that his goofy son-in-law will never cross any inappropriate lines.It is clear that “Modern Family” ― which sums up each episode with a relevant and cheesy morality lesson ― would never go that far, either. But it is comfortable dangling its toes over the edge in scenes like the one at the end of Season 1, when Gloria paralyzes Phil with a smooch to call off harassment from a stadium Kiss Cam, or when Phil pretends Gloria is his wife in front of an old nemesis. But more recently, the pair’s interactions have mellowed, a change Burrell noted when HuffPost asked him to put the show’s most uncomfortable relationship into words.“This doesn’t really happen in sitcoms very much, because most of the time you don’t really want the characters to grow,” Burrell said. “If the characters grow, you lose the whole situation that makes them funny in the first place.” Phil and Gloria, however, have grown quite a bit. A recent episode presents Gloria and Phil as close platonic friends as she offers him encouragement in his career, and he is undeniably more able to conduct himself normally in her presence.“Over the years, they’ve become sort of pals in a way,” Burrell said. Surely another series might have kept hammering laughs out of an awkward Phil-Gloria dynamic. Yet as one based on the age-old motif that some women are so extraordinarily alluring as to drive men onto rocky shorelines, or otherwise incapacitate them, it would have felt increasingly stale. Instead, “Modern Family” offers an alternate reality, where men and women can learn to be friends out of mutual respect for one another, as another nice ― yet perhaps still cheesy ― lesson in relationships.Clarification: A previous version of this story indicated “Modern Family” runs on basic cable. While it is syndicated on cable, it initially airs on ABC."

Wasserman Schultz is facing a primary challenge for the first time this year, her opponent a law professor, activist and progressive Sanders supporter named Tim Canova. But the primary's not until late August, long after the Democratic National Convention.",2016-05-21,"WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 16: Debbie Wasserman Schultz speaks onstage at the FORTUNE Most Powerful Women Summit on October 16, 2013 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Paul Morigi/Getty Images for FORTUNE)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb81468250000cf003a13ca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Democratic National Committee chair has thrown fuel on the flames of infighting just as the party faces a critical November election.To paraphrase the words of that Scottish master Robert Burns, the best laid plans of mice, men -- and women -- go often astray, or ""gang aft agley,"" as they say in the Highlands. No one knows this better than Hillary Rodham Clinton.Twice now, the flight of her presidential aspirations has been forced to circle the airport as other contenders put up an unexpected fight: In 2008, Barack Obama emerged to grab the Democratic nomination away and this year, although all signs point to her finally grabbing the brass ring, unexpected and powerful progressive resistance came from the mighty wind of the Bernie Sanders campaign.Certainly, Hillary Clinton is angered by all of this, but the one seemingly more aggrieved -- if public comments and private actions are any indication -- is Democratic National Committee chair and Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Hillary surrogate who takes umbrage like ordinary folks pop their vitamins in the morning.As we recently wrote, ""... She embodies the tactics that have eroded the ability of Democrats to once again be the party of the working class. As Democratic National Committee chair she has opened the floodgates for Big Money, brought lobbyists into the inner circle and oiled all the moving parts of the revolving door that twirls between government service and cushy jobs in the world of corporate influence.""And that ain't all. As a member of Congress, particularly egregious has been her support of the payday loan business, defying new regulations from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) that would rein in an industry that soaks desperate borrowers. As President Obama said, ""While payday loans might seem like easy money, folks often end up trapped in a cycle of debt.""In fact, according to an article by Bethany McLean in the May issue of The Atlantic, ""After studying millions of payday loans, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found that 67 percent went to borrowers with seven or more transactions a year, and the majority of borrowers paid more in fees than the amount of their initial loan.""A recent editorial in the Orlando Sentinel notes that 7 percent of Florida's population ""must resort to this predatory form of small-dollar credit - nearly the highest rate in the nation..."" What's more, ""Based on a 14-day loan term, the typical payday loan... had an annual percentage rate of 278 percent. Many lenders advertise rates of more than 300 percent."" Let us repeat that slowly... 300 percent!So why has Wasserman Schultz been so opposed to the CFPB's proposed rules? She has said, ""Payday lending is unfortunately a necessary component of how people get access to capital, [people] that are the working poor."" But maybe it has something more to do with the $2.5 million or so the payday loan industry has donated to Florida politicians from both parties since 2009. That's according to a new report by the liberal group Allied Progress. More than $50,000 of that cash has gone to Rep. Wasserman Schultz.But we digress. It's the skullduggery going on within the Democratic Party establishment that's our current concern and as we wrote in March, Rep. Wasserman Schultz ""has played games with the party's voter database, been accused of restricting the number of Democratic candidate debates and scheduling them at odd days and times to favor Hillary Clinton, and recently told CNN's Jake Tapper that superdelegates -- strongly establishment and pro-Clinton -- are necessary at the party's convention so deserving incumbent officials and party leaders don't have to run for delegate slots 'against grassroots activists.' Let that sink in, but hold your nose against the aroma of entitlement.""Now Wasserman Schultz has waded into the controversy over what happened or didn't happen last weekend when Sanders supporters loudly and vehemently objected to the rules at the Nevada State Democratic Convention. In truth, some behaved badly at the event and others made trollish, violent and obscene threats to Democratic state chair Roberta Lange via phone, email and social media. There's no excuse for such aggressive, creepy conduct, and Sanders was quick and direct in apologizing for the behavior of the rowdies and bullies.But there is a double standard at play here. Why, pray tell, shouldn't the peaceful majority of Sanders people be angry at the slow-motion, largely invisible rigging of the political process by Wasserman Schultz and the Clinton machine -- all for the benefit of Secretary Clinton?Wasserman Schultz claims the party rules over which she has presided (and manipulated) are ""eminently fair."" She told CNN on Wednesday morning, ""It is critical that we as candidates, we as Democratic Party leaders, everyone involved needs to make sure that we can take all the steps that we need to, to ensure that the process is not only run smoothly but that the response from the supporters of both candidates is appropriate and civil.""In response to the DNC chair's remarks, Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver talked to CNN, too, and said Wasserman Schultz had been ""throwing shade on the Sanders campaign since the very beginning... Debbie Wasserman Schultz has really been a divider and not really provided the kind of leadership that the Democratic Party needs.""The Nation's Joan Walsh, a Clinton supporter critical of the Sanders campaign, concurs: ""Once again, Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz escalated a conflict that she should have worked to defuse,"" she writes. ""... Wasserman Schultz is not helping her friend Hillary Clinton with her attacks on Sanders. Just the appearance of fairness can go a long way in assuaging worries about fairness. Wasserman Schultz's defiant rebuke to the Sanders camp has made it worse.""So, too, has her abolition of the restraints that had been placed on corporate lobbyists and big money -- now they can write checks bankrolling what doubtless will be swank and profligate parties during this summer's Democratic National Convention. At The Intercept, Lee Fang and Zaid Jilani report that a number of the members of the Philadelphia host committee ""are actively working to undermine progressive policies achieved by President Barack Obama, including health care reform and net neutrality. Some... are hardly even Democratic Party stalwarts, given that many have donated and raised thousands of dollars for Republican presidential and congressional candidates this cycle.""This is a slap in the face to progressives calling for a halt to big money and allowing lobbyists to buy our elected officials. And it's contrary to what Hillary Clinton herself has said about money and politics on the campaign trail. The Sanders movement has shown that lots of cash can be raised from everyday people making small donations. His supporters and all of us should be outraged that Debbie Wasserman Schultz and convention officials have kowtowed not only to the corporate wing of their own party but also to those high rollers who back the opposition and ideas antithetical to a democracy.Rep. Wasserman Schultz is facing a primary challenge for the first time this year, her opponent a law professor, activist and progressive Sanders supporter named Tim Canova. But the primary's not until late August, long after the Democratic National Convention. Unless she steps down now or Hillary Clinton has her removed, Philadelphia will be dominated by someone who represents everything that has gone wrong with the Democratic Party and Washington. At the convention's opening session, Debbie Wasserman Schultz will be bringing the gavel down squarely on progressive hopes of returning the party to its legacy as champion of working people and the dispossessed.We've said it before and we'll say it again: Time for her to go."

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson TPX IMAGES OF THE DAY ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb81459200000c7010190d2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This column was written from bottom to top today. The reason we started with the end and worked our way back up is that we were inspired to go off on a rant (rather than our usual talking points for Democrats). This was due to unusually high levels of panic in the media this week (actually it's not that rare that mainstream media panic causes us to go off on a rant, just in general). But because we started with this extended rant, we're going to have to summarize the week in lightning fashion here in this intro, because we are way behind schedule now. So without much extraneous commentary, here are the stories we noticed during the week.The uninsured rate has now fallen to single digits, as the second year of final stats for Obamacare are in. This means seven million more people with healthcare, in 2015 alone. The uninsured rate stands at 9.1 percent, down 2.4 points last year alone. Oh, and the sky hasn't fallen yet, either.One town in Mississippi's schools have finally been desegregated -- hey, what's 50 years of waiting, right?Speaking of long waits, President Obama has finalized new federal overtime rules (we wrote about this effort in detail last January, when the process was getting underway). By doubling the threshold for being considered a ""salaried"" worker, Obama's new rule is going to boost the pay of millions of workers. Companies that put ""managers"" on pathetically low salaries and then work them 70 or 80 hours a week will not be able to do so any longer. They've either got to pay the employees time-and-a-half for any work over 40 hours, or they've got to hire enough people that nobody has to work 80 hours a week. Pretty simple idea. Pay people what they're worth. Obama didn't raise the cutoff limit as high as some Union groups wanted, but he did more than double it -- from $23,660 a year to $47,476 a year. Importantly, the new law has a provision in it to adjust the level every three years, so that workers won't have to wait decades for another change. The new rule goes into effect in December, so either a bigger paycheck or a lot of time off (for the same salary) will be Obama's parting gift to millions of American workers.Let's see, what else happened? Joe Biden wrote a note to himself that was downright endearing.There was a fracas at a political meeting last week, although not the one you think I'm talking about. Things got rather shouty on the floor of the House of Representatives, as Republicans had to hold a vote on gay rights open long enough for seven Republicans to change their vote to denying rights (after already voting for the bill). Cries of ""Shame! Shame! Shame!"" and ""Regular order!"" and booing can all be heard.There was a lot of marijuana news, some of which we're saving for the awards section. A new study came out showing how much revenue states ($20.5 billion) and the federal government ($8 billion) are missing out on through refusing to legalize (and tax) marijuana.One marijuana provider is fighting back against government interference in court, which they should have every right to do.And finally, in the ""what have they been smoking"" department, we have the editors of USA Today (which bills itself as ""America's Newspaper,"" we might mention), who created a scary map showing (gasp!) weed is moving out of Colorado to other states. Except that they couldn't find Colorado on the map -- which showed Wyoming instead. Whoops!For all the state-level progress on marijuana legal reform, the bigger battle has always been with the federal government's outdated laws. While many large goals are still out of reach (descheduling marijuana, or outright federal legalization), smaller goals continue to be achieved.This week, the House passed a bill that will open up the Veterans Affairs system to medical marijuana. Or at least force them to stop actively fighting against it. This is a step in the right direction. As Tom Angell, Chairman of Marijuana Majority put it:It's looking like this could finally be the year the federal government stops making veterans jump through costly, time-consuming hoops just to get legal access to medical marijuana. Cannabis has shown great promise in helping veterans deal with PTSD and treat chronic pain, and it's an increasingly attractive alternative to opioids. There's absolutely no reason the V.A. should be preventing its doctors from helping veterans who served our country find relief with medical marijuana.The bill was introduced by a regular champion of marijuana reform in the House, Representative Earl Blumenauer. Federal law is not going to change all at once -- it's going to require a lot of patient steps like the one that just passed the House. For taking the time and effort to legislate such steps, and for getting bipartisan support for his measure, Blumenauer is easily our Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week.[Congratulate Representative Earl Blumenauer on his House contact page, to let him know you appreciate his efforts.]Ed Rendell, former governor of Pennsylvania, really stepped in it this week. When asked if Donald Trump could possibly siphon off Democratic voters given his crude comments about women, Rendell responded:For every one [voter Trump gains] he'll lose one-and-a-half, two Republican women. Trump's comments like, 'You can't be a 10 if you're flat-chested,' that'll come back to haunt him. There are probably more ugly women in America than attractive women. People take that stuff personally. He demeans women. He demeans Mexican Americans, I think women are rightfully irritated by how he talks. Plus, you don't know where he stands. One day he's for Planned Parenthood, the next day he's against it.Rendell personally wins not only a (Dis-)Honorable Mention award, but also the prize for ""not recognizing irony when it comes out of your own mouth,"" since he apparently didn't link his own ""ugly women"" comment to his scolding Trump for demeaning women. Next time, engage brain before opening mouth!But our Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week award goes to any supporter of Bernie Sanders who actually did engage in violence during last week's state party convention. We've got a lot more to say about this, below, I should mention.Sure, the media hyped the fight. First-hand reports didn't sound anywhere near as bad as what happened was portrayed, in fact. But while speaking up is allowable (no matter how loud) in politics, violence is not. Chair-throwing is violence, whether it hits anyone or not. Death threats are violence. There is a bright line which has been crossed, to state the obvious.So anyone who participated in any violence in Nevada, and certainly anyone who made threats either during or after the fracas is hereby awarded our Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week. Violence in politics is always wrong. Always. And everyone should loudly condemn it no matter who does it or for what perceived reason. Period.Volume 392 (5/20/16)Every once in a while, instead of writing talking points, I feel the need to unleash a rant. Today is one of those times.The past week has seen an explosion of panic in the media over Bernie Sanders and his campaign. We can probably expect a lot more of this, right up until the final primary contests early next month, in fact. So I felt it was time to offer up a countering opinion. To anyone else out there who is getting frustrated with the increasing levels of angst out there, I offer up the following advice:Don't Panic!Can we all just take a deep breath? I'm speaking to many Democratic voters as well as the bulk of the mainstream media, here, just to clarify. Because far too many seem to currently be going off the deep end -- due mostly to selective amnesia, one assumes. But from where I sit, this is an overreaction to a very short-term situation. So please, let's just take a deep breath and try to relax a little bit. Or, as Douglas Adams would say: ""Don't panic!""Last week there was a bit of a fracas at the Nevada Democratic state convention. Rules were bent or ignored, tempers ran high, and the outcome in question was over a grand total of two delegates to the national convention. Two. That's it. Obviously, the entire episode was way out of proportion from the start.Then the media jumped in, and blew things stratospherically out of proportion. Goaded by this panic-mode reaction, some prominent Democrats began saying things they really shouldn't have. My own senator, Dianne Feinstein, wondered on camera whether the 2016 convention would resemble the riots in Chicago in 1968. Really, DiFi? You really think that's what will happen? Because I don't, nor should any sane person who knows a little history.The history I'm talking about doesn't reach back to the days of the Vietnam War, either. I'm talking about the previous contested Democratic nomination race, in fact, which happened only eight years ago. I'm beginning to get the feeling I'm one of the few who does remember what happened then, because everyone else seems to be having too much fun freaking out right now. Well, not everyone, to be fair. There are a few other sane voices crying in the wilderness, such as MSNBC's Steve Kornacki, who recently tweeted:Talking about the final days of the '08 primary season with some Dems now, I'm struck by how tame it all seems. ""Oh, that was nothing compared to what Sanders is doing now!"" I'll hear. But again, go back and find the commentary from Dems back then. There was a lot of panic that [Hillary Clinton] was undermining the party and doing all sorts of dark, devious things. I believe Dems now remember it as being tame because things all worked out for them. She dropped out in June, endorsed Obama and they won, then she joined the admin -- no harm done. So people now remember late May '08 very differently than they experienced it at the time. That happens a lot in life, and I think it's very possible the same will happen with Dems when it comes to this current moment.He is exactly right. Memories are selective because we now know the outcome -- which we didn't, at the time. Exactly eight years ago, the Democratic Party was split down the middle, and feelings ran a lot higher than anything we've seen this year. Don't believe me? Do some research, if your own memories of the time has faded.Back in 2008, the race between Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama was tighter than this year's race. Because of this, the Clinton camp was arguing very strenuously for the delegates from Michigan and Florida to be counted at the convention. But, by the rules, these delegates were disallowed. Forty-eight states followed the rules laid down by the party for the primary schedule. Two states ignored the rules, which plainly stated that any state not following the rules would not have its delegates seated at the convention. All the Democratic candidates -- in deference to the party rules -- refused to campaign in the two states. One candidate ignored this, however. Hillary Clinton encouraged these two states' rulebreaking by actively campaigning (and, unsurprisingly, winning) in Florida and Michigan. With the overall race so close, these votes might have mattered, so Clinton pushed very hard for the party rules to be changed -- after the fact.Remember all that? Kind of puts Nevada squabbling over two delegates in some context, doesn't it? As for the contentiousness and politeness of the race (now versus then), nothing that's happened this year even comes close to how hard Barack and Hillary went after each other.Almost to the day, exactly eight years ago Hillary Clinton made the most jaw-dropping casual reference I've ever heard any politician utter. Here's the story, in case you've forgotten:Smart candidates don't invoke the possibility of their opponents being killed. This seems so obvious it shouldn't need to be said, but apparently, it needs to be said.That was on May 23, 2008. Clinton was also speaking out about the Michigan and Florida fight, comparing it to fraudulent elections in Zimbabwe, the recount of the 2000 election, and even ""the abolition of slavery."" Hillary Clinton campaigned to the very end -- and even beyond. When the votes were counted in the final primary, Clinton gave a speech and refused to concede the race to Barack Obama. From that speech:Now, the question is: Where do we go from here? And given how far we've come and where we need to go as a party, it's a question I don't take lightly. This has been a long campaign, and I will be making no decisions tonight.She then went on to invite her supporters to ""share their thoughts"" at her campaign website, and to state that she would be in consultations ""to determine how to move forward."" This was after the last vote had been counted, proving beyond a shadow of a doubt that she had lost the race. But she still had a plan for convincing a bunch of superdelegates to switch their support to her.In fact, it took four days -- and a face-to-face meeting with Obama arranged by Dianne Feinstein -- before Clinton would concede she had lost. That's where we all were, eight years ago.Clinton supporters were even more fervent back then than the so-called ""Bernie Bros"" of today. Salon helpfully points this out (with links for all their points):Back in 2008, we had Hillary Clinton supporters musing openly about Obama being a drug dealer, and her chief strategist went on TV and deliberately said ""cocaine"" as many times as he could in relation to Obama (who wrote in his memoir about blowing coke as a college student). Clinton herself aimed barbed personal attacks at Obama, calling him a vacant naïf who couldn't do anything beyond give a good speech. There were racially fraught swipes, scornful dismissals, and utterly bizarre insinuations that the race could be upended by anything, including an assassination. After Clinton conceded defeat, we had to tolerate the PUMAs -- remember those assholes? -- who made ""Party Unity My Ass"" their mantra and got a lot of media attention (primarily from Fox News) for employing incoherent racism as their chief weapon in a deluded quest to keep alive the Hillary-Obama division and make John McCain president.Remember all that? I do. Which is why I'm not panicking now. Things worked out back then, and they are very likely going to work out now. For all the frenzied calls for Bernie Sanders to get out of the race, stop campaigning so hard, stop hitting Hillary, stop fighting for delegates, and to condemn the violence in Nevada for the umpteenth time, what is most likely is that the period from now until the final primary will not even be remembered by anyone this November. The party is not about to engage in civil war. Don't listen to the idiots in the media who are predicting this (or 1968 happening again, for that matter). They're going to be wrong.Just reading the headlines in the Washington Post of late, you'd think Bernie Sanders was singlehandedly destroying the Democratic Party. After Nevada, Bernie put out a public statement which clearly showed his feelings towards what had happened (emphasis added, because apparently some people didn't read this part):Within the last few days there have been a number of criticisms made against my campaign organization. Party leaders in Nevada, for example, claim that the Sanders campaign has a ""penchant for violence."" That is nonsense. Our campaign has held giant rallies all across this country, including in high-crime areas, and there have been zero reports of violence. Our campaign of course believes in non-violent change and it goes without saying that I condemn any and all forms of violence, including the personal harassment of individuals. But, when we speak of violence, I should add here that months ago, during the Nevada campaign, shots were fired into my campaign office in Nevada and apartment housing complex my campaign staff lived in was broken into and ransacked.The Post ran this under the apocalyptic headline: ""This Bernie Sanders Statement On The Nevada Convention Reads Like An Open Threat To The Democratic Establishment."" There were zero threats in Bernie's statement. Zero. He didn't even mention the national convention, and yet soon most in the media were spinning it as: ""Bernie's threatening violence in Philadelphia."" Poppycock. Read the whole statement yourself, and see if anything in it even remotely constitutes any such ""threat.""Bernie's statement wasn't enough for many in the media and in the Democratic Party. He was told he had to denounce the violence stronger and more unequivocally. He then began doing so, any time a television camera was on him. That's really the sum total of the story -- ""Bernie denounces supporters' violence"" -- but you wouldn't have known that from the panicky coverage all week long.The Washington Post has, for months, pretty obviously been in the tank for Hillary Clinton. Back in early March, it was even pointed out that they ran 16 negative stories about Bernie Sanders in the space of 16 hours. But occasionally, you do hear some actual facts from someone at the Post, as in today's story comparing 2008 to 2016. Facts and figures plainly show that the Democratic Party is a lot more unified now than it was back then. The most striking data point comes from a comparison over the polled question: ""Does a long primary race help or hurt the Democratic nominee?"" In 2008, only 38 percent thought a tough race ""helps the nominee,"" while a whopping 54 percent said it ""hurts the nominee."" And now? The numbers are reversed. Only 34 percent think a long race hurts the nominee, while 59 percent say it helps.That really puts things in perspective. No matter what the media mavens think, Democratic voters are just fine with Bernie staying in the race until the end. Just like Hillary Clinton did back in 2008. Doing so will toughen Clinton up and put her in fighting form to face off against Donald Trump -- just like it sharpened Barack Obama up in 2008.Bernie Sanders is going to lose the nomination race. I say this while fully intending to proudly cast my own primary vote for Sanders in a few weeks, I should point out. But he has certainly earned the right to stay in until California and New Jersey get a chance to vote. He is not some gadfly who won a single state or maybe two. He has run a campaign that has surprised everyone -- including him. He got farther than anyone expected, and tapped into an astonishing amount of discontent with the status quo. He deserves to have a lot of input in writing the party's platform this year, and hopefully his movement won't fizzle out after Clinton locks the nomination up. But he's far from being Ralph Nader or anything. Voting for John McCain seemed semi-reasonable for Clinton supporters angry with Barack Obama in 2008, but my guess is that voting for Donald Trump is just not going to be a conceivable option for the vast majority of Sanders supporters.So my advice to Democrats is to just flat-out ignore the pearl-clutching frenzy in the media for the next few weeks. Primary season is almost over, and all of this will soon be forgotten. It will likely make not a dime's worth of difference if Bernie quit the race tomorrow versus staying in until the final votes are counted. The end result is going to be the same. My guess is that Bernie will accept defeat more graciously than Clinton did back in 2008, in fact. I bet he'll concede long before she did, back then. And I bet he won't demand a face-to-face meeting before he does so, too.The Democratic Party is going to unite. Oh, sure, some disenchanted Bernie voters will either refuse to vote in November or vote for the Green Party (or maybe even write in Bernie's name). The majority of Bernie voters, however, will go through a period of disappointment and then realize that ""President Trump"" is so horrifying a concept that they'll vote for Hillary anyway (while holding their nose or not). Feelings always run high at the end of a close race. Tempers flare. But it's 2016, not a re-run of 1968 (sorry, DiFi). Heck, it's not even a re-run of 2008.It'll all be over soon. Until then, keep calm. Don't panic.Chris Weigant blogs at:Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigantFull archives of FTP columns: FridayTalkingPoints.comAll-time award winners leaderboard, by rank"

""We are not afraid of dialogue,"" announced alliance Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. Alas, the talks didn't get very far. Afterward he explained: ""it was reconfirmed that we disagree on the facts, on the narrative and the responsibilities in and around Ukraine."" Indeed, he added, ""there were profound disagreements.""Of course, this should surprise no one. After all, Russia is in a mini-Cold War with the U.S. and Europe over Ukraine. A meeting, even one that ran longer than expected, wasn't going to change anyone's opinion. Still, Stoltenberg emphasized the importance of ""open channels, for political dialogue, for predictability, for transparency"" at a time of increased tensions. Also on the agenda was discussing how to reduce risks from military activities, like when a Russian plane buzzed a U.S. destroyer.However, the issue of Moscow's relations with the West really doesn't belong with NATO. Only political decisions in the respective capitals can significantly improve ties. And that won't happen without a reassessment of everyone's respective national interests. Should the West maintain permanent confrontation with Russia over Ukraine?None of the allies has made a security commitment to Kiev. Indeed, Ukraine is not a member of NATO for a reason: few if any of the 28 members are willing to go to war with Russia over its neighbor. It turns out the Dutch aren't even willing to approve a treaty initiating closer economic and political relations, and they probably aren't alone in Europe. Nor does the infamous Budapest Memorandum, which formalized Kiev's disposal of Soviet nuclear-tipped missiles left in Ukraine when the Evil Empire dissolved, create any meaningful allied obligations. The signatory powers, most notably Washington, agreed to go to the United Nations if another country threatened to use nuclear weapons against Kiev. And Ukraine still signed.Should the U.S. and Europe treat Kiev as if it was a member of NATO, creating a de facto Article 5 commitment to go to war? There's a reason the alliance has a membership process: to decide which states warrant inclusion. One criterion is not to induct countries with a casus belli or two trailing behind. After all, no one wants membership to result in instant conflict.More fundamentally, inclusion only makes sense if it makes the existing allies more secure. No one seemed to consider this issue during the madcap alliance expansion after the Cold War because no one really still thought of NATO as a military pact. Instead, the organization was treated as an international gentleman's club, to which everybody who was somebody wanted to belong. However, the Ukraine conflict reminded everyone that war could happen, leading most members to clear their throats uncomfortably when the Baltic States were mentioned. Although the latter are full alliance members, no one else ever imagined actually fighting for them. Only now have some advocates of NATO expansion remembered that the reason to go to war on another nation's behalf is because the latter's independence is vital to one's own, not to satisfy one's charitable impulses.Which is why NATO members would be mad to include Ukraine. Moscow has behaved badly and Ukrainians are suffering as a result, but such humanitarian considerations, though real, are a poor basis for issuing military commitments. Kiev simply doesn't much matter geopolitically to Europe or America. Ukraine spent most of its recent existence under Imperial Russia and then the Soviet Union. Since gaining independence in 1991 Kiev has suffered corrupt, incompetent, and authoritarian governance. The allies barely noticed. While Ukraine ultimately could become a significant trading partner with Europe, that day is far in the future and isn't worth war. Kiev's travails may be regionally disruptive, but they don't make either Europe or America less secure.Indeed, despite all of the tub-thumping about the supposed new Russian threat, Vladimir Putin is a poor excuse for Joseph Stalin or Adolf Hitler. His aggregate ""conquests"" so far are pitiful: Crimea and some influence over Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and the Donbas. There's no evidence that he covets any other territory, certainly none without an ethnic-Russian majority. Moscow would have a hard enough time conquering and occupying Ukraine, let alone Europe. Putin might be evil, but he isn't stupid.And despite Moscow's modest military revival, Europe alone vastly outranges Russia in economic strength and military spending. America's global reach is unparalleled. Despite the refusal by most European states to invest in their militaries, Moscow still is in no position to stage a continental Blitzkrieg. Former Russian Finance Minister Alexey Kudrin recently observed that without its reserve funds Moscow would have had to cut military outlays in half after the drop in oil prices. Putin can demand national respect and intervene in small foreign conflicts, but his country is no longer a true Weltmacht.Which Europe obviously recognizes by its steadfast refusal to do more militarily. Stoltenberg was almost exultant because last year the European NATO states only slightly reduced their collective spending. Because for years they had rapidly cut outlays. The nations supposedly most at risk, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and Poland, devote between one and two percent of their GDPs on the military. They claim to worry about being eaten by the Russian bear but the most they ask of their citizens is two cents on the dollar? If they can't be bothered to do more, they certainly shouldn't be calling on America for a permanent garrison.There's still reason for the West to oppose Russia's actions in Ukraine, though the allies' hands are hardly clean. The U.S. and Europe took their Cold War victory and ignored Moscow's interests: expanding NATO to Russia's doorstep; dismembering Serbia, a long-time Russian friend; offering alliance membership to Georgia and Russia; seeking to pull Kiev into Europe's economic orbit; supporting a street revolution against Ukraine's corrupt but elected leader, who leaned toward Moscow. None of these warranted military hostilities toward Kiev, and the Russian people have paid a high price for dubious gains (some Ukrainians aren't sure they want the Donbas back). However, the U.S. would not have supinely accepted the Russian-backed overthrow of a friendly government in Mexico. Provoking a wounded bear is stupid in international relations as well as in the natural world.The Brussels meeting was never going to change anyone's mind. But then, nothing else is likely to do so either. Sanctions remain in place to no obvious effect. They punish but have not transformed Moscow's behavior. And they discourage Russian cooperation on issues including North Korea, terrorism, Iran, Syria and Afghanistan. Even worse, the West's economic war has pushed Moscow toward Beijing despite important differences between the two countries. Another great game is afoot, but Washington is focused on children splashing in the kiddie pool.The U.S. and Europe must decide whether they are willing to wage a permanent mini-Cold War over Ukraine. Russia took back Crimea lawlessly, but no more so than the allies broke up Serbia and created an independent Kosovo. A majority of Crimeans probably supported the move, though only a free and fair referendum, unlike that conducted by Moscow, would tell for sure. In any case, Crimea is no more likely to go back to Ukraine than Kosovo is likely to go back to Serbia. The issue is effectively closed.No doubt Moscow has supported separatists in the Donbas, but also no doubt there are separatists. It's a mix of civil war and aggression, which isn't unusual. This certainly is not the first and won't be the last insurgency to have outside support: just ask Washington about the mujahedeen, Contras, and other U.S.-backed groups. While everyone seems to agree on the political settlement represented by the Minsk agreement--it was the one reported area of agreement at the Council meeting--both Kiev and Moscow appear lax in implementation. Even the end of shooting won't mean harmony is restored. Look at the Balkans, where the allies put their limited skills at international social engineering to work with less than stellar results. Even in the best case, Ukraine is likely to remain a mess.Which suggests the allies should seek to forge a deal with Moscow that gets both sides out of the present geopolitical cul-de-sac. Agree to disagree over Crimea, neutralize Ukraine by withdrawing Russian support from insurgents and NATO's promise of eventual membership for Kiev, liberalize trade opportunities for Ukraine in both directions, and swap Moscow's acquiescence in the results of Ukraine's political system for grants of significant autonomy to areas filled with ethnic Russians. As an independent state Kiev could refuse to go along, but then it would be on its own against the Bear.Call it ""appeasement"" if you like, but Ukraine has no automatic claim to Western support, especially when continuing confrontation is unlikely to yield any practical result. Indeed, respecting the interest of adversaries once was a time-honored diplomatic technique. A bit more appeasement could have prevented World War I, out of which World War II emerged. Appeasement failed in the latter because Adolf Hitler would never be satisfied. Putin's geopolitical aims appear to be far more modest. Addressing them makes more sense than maintaining a mini-Cold War. Only a deal seems likely to deliver peace for Ukraine, security for Russia, stability for Europe, and satisfaction for America. (The U.S. really has nothing meaningful at stake geopolitically, only moral sentiment.)It's good that NATO and Russia met. But the former is not the real decision-maker. Dialogue should continue, with the EU and U.S. prepared to negotiate a deal normalizing relations. Moscow could say no, of course. However, the allies won't know without trying. And everyone would benefit from ending the current impasse. Especially the Ukrainian people. This article was first posted to Forbes online."

These include 1) when it's time to move the person to a facility, 2) if the person finds a new love interest, 3) when the person no longer talks, 4) when the person no longer recognizes you, and 5) when it's time to engage hospice care services. This article will look at that last item. The need to involve hospice can be extremely difficult and even depressing. It's common to dwell on dark thoughts of impending death. Some families delay ordering hospice care because it would force them to acknowledge that the end is near and they just can't deal with that.The very word 'hospice' can be frightening. This truly does signify that the end is near. One is about to lose his or her loved one, as difficult or wonderful as the relationship may be. Some caregivers experience what is called 'anticipatory grief.' That is, they begin grieving over the person's death even before the individual dies. Caregivers might want to consider getting counseling to help them cope. Most hospice organizations offer counseling programs for family members or friends. Caregivers should keep in mind that their loved ones may not be aware that death is approaching. Conversely, people with Alzheimer's may, at some level, perceive that the end is near. Either way, the caregiver's suffering is real. But there is still the opportunity to have a relationship and to enjoy life with the loved one until the end. This will require an intentional acceptance, as well as gratitude for being given a life shared with the person. Here's my personal experience with finding a way to accept hospice care. At first I was in denial. Even though my life partner's medical team told me it was likely that Ed would pass away within six months, I continued believing and behaving as though he would live another year or two, or even more.I eventually overcame my denial and decided to at least consider obtaining hospice care for Ed. However, I felt as though this would be tantamount to signing his death warrant. I knew that was ridiculous, but that's how I felt.I delayed the call to hospice for weeks, telling myself Ed didn't need it quite yet. The truth was that I wasn't able to deal with it quite yet. Seeing how weak and frail Ed was, I finally felt compelled to take action. I consulted Dr. Doug Smucker, a family physician colleague at the University of Cincinnati who specialized in end-of-life care. After answering all of my questions, Doug looked at me kindly and said, ""You know, Marie, the real question for the caregiver is 'how can I help the person have the highest possible quality of life in the time that is remaining?'""That completely changed my thinking about the situation. It gave me a new and positive goal: to bring Ed as much happiness as possible. There was something I could do. It led me to think about all the special things I could do for Ed: visiting him more often, taking my little Shih Tzu to see him, having a classical violinist come and play a concert just for Ed in his room, reading to him from The New York Times, and buying Ed even more of the little stuffed animals he loved so much.After that talk with Doug, I spent many pleasant hours thinking up special ways to bring Ed pleasure. Once I got my mind off his looming death, we were able to have a beautiful, pleasurable, months-long conclusion to our long life together.A loving, comfortable end-of-life experience is certainly the main reason to place a loved one in hospice care. However, there are financial benefits as well. Medicare and other insurers often will pay for services and medical supplies that are not otherwise covered.In reality, the decision to enroll a loved one in hospice care signifies anything but giving up.It is the most courageous, selfless, and compassionate action one can possibly take once a loved one once has reached the final stage of life.Marie Marley is the award-winning author of Come Back Early Today: A Memoir of Love, Alzheimer's and Joy, and the co-author (with Neurologist Daniel C.

Through the end of April, it looked like no one really wanted to try that anyway.That's changing quickly. But one of the outside groups that has popped up to advocate for Trump has raised less than $1.1 million -- a practically trifling amount by presidential super PAC standards -- and had just more than $65,000 in cash on hand at the end of April, according to new campaign finance reports filed with the Federal Election Commission. The filings show just how far the group, Great America PAC, has to go to reach the big leagues of political money, essentially starting from scratch as far as megadonors go -- which likely is why the group decided to release this week the names of some bigger-name supporters who aren't listed in the latest FEC report but presumably will be in the one covering the month of May.Great America has supported Trump -- who finished off his last remaining major GOP rival, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, in early May -- with a middling $2.1 million in independent expenditures so far this cycle.The reality TV star's campaign continues to say it ""doesn't have super PACs,"" though the candidate has signaled he doesn't mind super PAC money helping the Republican party. Nevertheless, Great America finds itself competing with an even newer pro-Trump super PAC, the Committee for American Sovereignty, which registered with the FEC on April 8 and hasn't filed a report showing its fundraising or spending yet. It has publicized its own list of well-known GOP backers and has the involvement of people who apparently are close to Trump.Meanwhile, Trump's rivals gained steam. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's standby deep-pocketed supporters once again were a reliable source of super PAC infusions in April. Priorities USA Action brought in $8.6 million last month.Haim and Cheryl Saban together gave another $3 million to Priorities, the largest of a coalition of outside groups supporting Clinton's presidential bid. That puts the couple's total contributions to the group at $10 million. Daniel Abraham, another repeat donor to Priorities, gave $1 million - he's now $3 million. Jon Stryker, also a go-to liberal megadonor, dropped his first $500,000 into Priorities' coffers since 2012, when it was the pro-Barack Obama vehicle; then, he gave the group $2 million. Stryker is also a regular giver to House Majority PAC, which supports Democratic House candidates; he's given that super PAC more than $2 million over the last several years.While major Clinton ally and former hedge funder George Soros didn't give to Priorities last month -- he's shelled out $7 million for the group already -- his son carried on the family tradition. Alexander Soros cut a $1 million check on April 30.The younger Soros, like his father, serves on the board of nonprofit organizations and started his own philanthropic foundation. The Priorities donation is certainly his largest in the realm of federal politics. And at age 30, he's far younger than the typical super PAC donor.Priorities spent more than $6.6 million in April. Most of that -- $5.8 million - went to a single firm, Precision Network LLC, for ""digital ad buy reservation."" The group still had $46.7 million in the bank, and in fact spent some of those reserves this past week with a major TV ad campaign attacking Trump. But as Priorities' financial picture looked a little brighter, Trump's rivals to his right exhausted nearly all of their resources in April. Support for Our Principles PAC -- the group that was launched to try to prevent Trump from winning the nomination -- dried up, more or less dying with Florida Sen. Marco Rubio's presidential candidacy in March. Receipts dropped from $8.3 million in March to just $2.7 million last month.Paul Singer, the billionaire hedge fund manager, and Connecticut investor Michael Vlock, an erstwhile donor to Rubio's Conservative Solutions PAC, each gave $1 million to Our Principles in April. But the PAC spent more than it took in for the month, about $3.1 million to $2.7 million, and ended the month with a paltry $67,842 on hand.That Singer is one of the last backers, it seems, of what became a $19 million-plus unsuccessful effort to derail Trump's march to the Republican nomination could be telling. His contributions can be a signal for other major Republican donors, especially those also in the hedge fund industry. How Singer goes, so too might other big Republican financiers.There are still some big slugs of cash sitting around waiting to be disbursed somehow, however. As of April 30, more than $17 million remained in the coffers of Right to Rise, the super PAC formed to give monetary muscle to former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's White House bid. Bush's own campaign, though, lacked much strength, and he halted his run in February."
20,ENTERTAINMENT,Leopoldo Gout: From Immigrant to Hollywood Power Player and Author,"Jeff Rivera, ContributorWriter | Producer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/leopoldo-gout-from-immigr_b_10078722.html,,2016-05-21,2016-05-21-1463813897-3575622-LeopoldoPortraitgood3.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-21-1463813897-3575622-LeopoldoPortraitgood3-thumb.jpg,"Being an immigrant is something that could hold a lot of people back in life and yet for Leopoldo Gout, it was the force he needed to shape all of his success. The author behind the new book 'Genius: The Game' is a man inspired by literature, art, science, movies, television, and the world around him. Gout has already made a name for himself as an artist and filmmaker. Now turning to film, television, books and even virtual reality, Leopoldo hopes to project a sense of community and multiculturalism through diverse and intricate storytelling. He has an interest in strong characters who face the impossible in order to find a genuine sense of meaning in their lives and his young adult fiction questions the expectations that come with dystopian and magical spaces.The following interview delves into Leopoldo Gout's new book, the first in the series, while also looking at where his biggest inspirations come from and how he overcame insurmountable obstacles including being dyslexic to accomplish his dreams.Piecing Together a Passion Project:  What inspired you to create this particular novel? I came up with the idea by looking at the landscape of young adult fiction where there are several dystopian worlds with super powers and magic. It was from this that I started to draw on the fact that we are all born with one superpower; our brain. It has allowed us to go to the moon and back! The book is about how you can be a superhero without having to have an actual superpower. At the core of the novel, it tells us how you can change your own fate and that you can decide right now to take yourself seriously. I wanted to create a space that has power through our imagination, I think there's lots of energy in that.What gave you the idea to do a story about a band of misfit geniuses that work together to save the world? As an artist, I've always been interested in the experience of movies, television, and video games. I digested a lot of this and tried to sow it into a very compelling adventure. When I was young, I would watch Raiders of the Lost Ark and read adventure novels and I've always had that in the back of my mind. I always wanted to combine the opening sequence of Indiana Jones with the idea of being able to see the world as cool and different. It's about the power of experience.I also did a lot of research before the novel which helped shape the way it turned out. For example, I looked at a kid in Sierra Leone who at 12-years-old built a windmill out of trash in order to generate electricity and help her mother see because she was losing her eyesight. I have done extraordinary research about all sorts of kids of the same age that have shifted their destiny. I'm interested in this as I, on my own, have done a lot of incredible things. I'm not talking about fame or fortune, I just get to do the things I'm passionate about and, to me, that's a superpower.  The book has a very diverse cast of characters. Why was this important to you? I think I wanted to do my contribution as a Mexican immigrant in the United States and wanted to say something that was different. I wanted something more of the world than I experienced and that I see on my own. I've always seen the world as a multicultural, multi-ethnic, multi-dimensional, place with people from all sorts of races and interests and genders. That energy is extraordinary, and yet a lot of young adult fiction is not as diverse as the way I have experienced the world.I'm really passionate with Genius because I feel like as an immigrant I'm a part of the political landscape that we live in. It's really a call to arms. I'm saying that we are here and we're not going to go anywhere, and we can change the world and there's a lot of positivity even in illegal immigrants. The parents of the lead character in my book are illegal. This country was made by immigrants and that's something I've always loved about it. My story is all inspired by real people. They are young people that have imagination and curiosity who are the enemies of the far right. The enemy of the rhetoric is curiosity. These people are changing the world. They're cool and different.Finding the Right Audience:Who would you say the book is targeted towards? I think, mostly, I wanted it to talk to my kids and to people of all ages and give them a little bottled version of all of my experiences. I think this approach was very natural for me. It's been incredible to see how the teen age group is responding to the book. We're presenting the book in many diverse schools all over the country. We take a bunch of books and the kids come from all over the place to get one. Many of the school librarians have told me that it's a great experience for the kids because the book is about all sorts of varied experiences and it's influenced by my life, but it's also connected to the traditions of great world adventures, of art and other thrilling novels. It's about changing your stars through your imagination.How do convince kids who've never read any of your books that they should pick this up instead of another video game? I always start by telling kids a little bit about my life. I grew up in a middle class Mexican family and I lived in an apartment with my mother, two sisters and my brother. Even though I didn't grow up with a lot of money, I grew up with a lot of culture. I read books. I met explorers, filmmakers, and artists. My mother instilled in us this incredible wonder and curiosity for the world. So, I always start with that and I tell the kids that I was lucky because somebody told me that the world is big out there and that we should grab a book as a lever of understanding. My talks with kids are not just about the story in the book, but about the process, about my process. I have an advantage in that I found a rich life that has given me a platform to speak on all sorts of things. I wanted to be able to share this with them and it's been amazing so far.How is it that you are getting the books to schools? It's pre-organized. Basically, librarians have a lot of competition because of the Internet, so they partner with local book stores from all over the country. Then, the local book stores stock it. But I usually end up giving away some of my books, too. I'm doing this for the long haul and for the right reasons. To me, it's more about getting it to a wide range of teachers, students, artists, to as a wide audience as I can get to. I also partner with Arizona State University and CSI (The Center for Science and the Imagination) through Brian David Johnson who's starting Project Genius. He used to be Intel's futurist and he loves my book and he's been inspired by it. He's basically trying to do what I wrote about in the real world and the ASU Foundation is trying to find genius kids with under-privileged communities and try to figure out a way to empower them through technology. We're doing all sorts of different programs and processes with the kids and I couldn't be more proud. The Art of Writing and Publishing:What's your writing process like? I'm interested in art and a lot of my work starts with doodling and drawing. I've always had a very visual experience. I always begin by making drawings and notes while I research an idea. I'm very passionate about the research process. Every project I've done, whether it's a movie or a book, is about connecting stories, digesting stories, like being a detective.I spoke with people from China to Africa, I spoke with coders, with bloggers from all nationalities and I have a research associate the great writer Keith Thomas who helped me tremendously. I talk to all sorts of people and I watch endless videos on Youtube. I always read hundreds of stories before doing the outline for the piece. Then, I do more drawings. It takes me many rounds of editorial drafts with my publisher because English is my second language and I'm dyslexic. So, it's not only hard for me to write but I'm also picky, and I love working with the editors. I work really hard to make sure that I accomplish the project that I wanted to do.I have my own way of doing things and I have really great collaborators that work with me, including Brian David Johnson. I have a wide source of people that are happy to help. Writing in a different language is always a challenge but I love it. My process is more like being a mad scientist in a lab blended with an artist in a studio than a writer scribbling in a notebook.How do you find the time to write alongside being a film executive? I love what I do. I really love what I do and I do it all the time. I'm writing a script as well that I finished with another partner, so I have the capacity to do a lot of things. It's just my way of doing things. My younger brother who's a film director is my business partner in a film company. He can only do one thing at a time whereas I love doing a bunch of things at a time.What is it like working with James Patterson as an executive? Did he give you any useful advice when writing the novel? Jim and I have a very different style, but I respect him tremendously. I've been working for him for a long time so obviously you get influenced by everyone you work with, but Jim is one of the most disciplined, hard working people I've ever met and he's always told me ""Leopoldo, learn to focus and drive through focus."" I've never met somebody as focused as he has been with his brand and his imagination and to me it has been very inspiring. I'm very proud that I created this thing out of my own heart and he was very generous to give me a great quote. Why didn't you publish the book through one of his publishing companies? Well, I wrote my first novel with someone else and this one, Genius, is published with Feiwel & Friends / Macmillan. When I put together the treatment for this novel, I had a few solid ideas and chapters and I did a lot of research. After meeting various teams I met Jean Feiwel and later Holly West and their entire publishing team at Feiwel & Friends who have been incredible partners.To be honest, it's not about the publisher, it's about the people. When I met the people at Feiwel & Friends it just felt like home. They really got me and pushed me to be brave. I feel like they really brought the best out of me and I couldn't be more happy about having them as the publisher.Are you interested in turning Genius into a movie? Yes. We are already developing a movie and reality show and there's multiple studios and television companies who are making offers right now. I also want to develop the vision if we do a film, I'm doing it initially myself because I have the advantage of already being a filmmaker. I'm very excited about it! It has a tone that I have not seen before and I believe it will contribute to the culture and can truly go into a place that will feel refreshing in that space. I strongly believe that global audiences are ready for a rift in the space. I'm also focusing on the foundation led by Brian David Johnson at Arizona State University and the Center for Science & the Imagination because they really are creating a global project. What I love about ASU is their ideas and that it's a public university so the IP will be fully owned by whoever creates it. So if we develop an incredible idea with and for a particular community, that community will fully own it. It's something that can help us contribute to society in a positive way and I'm looking forward to dive fully into the project. I have always raised the question that: Can BIG GLOBAL entertainment and art help our world in some way? I hope with Project Genius that the answer is yes. Where can people get the copy of the book? Everywhere, in every bookstore and it's also available on Amazon and my website geniustheseries.com. I've been talking to people from all over the world about the book and it's been an overwhelmingly positive experience."

According to Buzzfeed ""the future of the Apple Store looks like a normal Apple Store, but with a bunch of trees."" While that is probably an over simplification, it seems odd that Apple is focusing on a store redesign when what it really needs is to get back on the innovation track, improve falling software quality, and provide better service to existing customers at its genius bars. Calling them genius groves is not going to make customers that face increasing waits for service any happier. Forgetting the lifetime value of a customerPaying Angela Ahrendts $73 million to leave Burberry and run the Apple stores does not impress customers that get nickel and dimed when they paid a lot for Apple Care but had their product break just after the warranty expires. Being an owner of 9 Macs, two iPhones, two iPods, and two iPads apparently does not qualify you as a good customer that deserves a break, but being on Angela's celebrity list will get you a $17,000 Apple Watch for free. How well has that strategy worked for Apple? Many in the know say the product, the first collaboration of Tim Cook and Ms. Ahrents in the post Steve Jobs era, is a bona fide failure. Maybe those that got the watch for free can sell it some day for its historical value.From creative disrupter to incremental improverApple's turnaround from a company on the verge of going out of business to the most valuable company in the world is a phenomenal accomplishment in so many ways. Yet the concern about Apple's ability to innovate and lead in the wake of Steve Jobs death has not been overcome by the company's actions over the past few years. No doubt Tim Cook is an excellent executive. The problem is that the company recently announced its worst quarter in over a decade. It is clear to those that watch Apple closely is that it has become more like Toyota - innovating by incremental improvement - than the Apple of five years ago. Changing the stores to destinationsTime will tell if positioning the new stores as destinations will produce positive results. One thing is for certain. If Apple does not fill the stores with innovative, reliable, and desirable products sold and serviced by knowledgeable ""geniuses,"" its sales and profit trajectory is going to head in the wrong direction. A new campus and new stores are not likely to change that. I wish Apple and all of us users the best of luck. It appears we will increasingly need it."

And, of course, the reputedly healing waters bubbling up from deep within the Earth.The one thing it didn't have, until now: a choice of full-service five-star hotels.Although visitors have long enjoyed the 45-room Royal Crescent Hotel and Spa, for over 30 years it was the only option.Late last year, the Gainsborough Bath Spa hotel debuted, and, as a recent visit revealed, it's now the place to stay in this World Heritage city.Fashioned from several buildings -- a hospital, hotel and large private villa -- all dating from the 1800s, most of the 99 high-ceilinged rooms are exactly the same size (about 320 square feet), a feat achieved by completely gutting the interior walls of the buildings while keeping the historic facades intact.The location couldn't be better: in the very center of the city. There's an adequate fitness room with Technogym equipment, a complimentary minibar (mineral water and soft drinks), whisper-silent air conditioning, excellent bedside and bathroom lighting, and plenty of electrical outlets (both U.S. 120-volt and U.K. 240-volt).But the most unique feature is the hotel's expansive spa, fed directly by Bath's famous thermal mineral springs. Guests have free, unlimited access to the very thing that put Bath on the map in the first place (stay anywhere else and you'll have to pay extra to soak away whatever ails you).Like many hotels these days, the Gainsborough encourages direct bookings rather than through third-party sites. The incentives here are a bottle of Champagne and a 60-minute massage per room, per stay (book this well before arrival). Rates were recently as low as $262 per night for a midweek January 2017 visit, which is quite a bargain for a hotel of this sort. With the free massage and bubbly it's an even better deal.------thegainsboroughbathspa.co.ukBeau Street, Bath BA1 1QY, EnglandEmail: enquiries@thegainsboroughbathspa.co.uk"
23,IMPACT,Five Ways Digital Payments Are Coming to the Rescue in Emergencies,"Ruth Goodwin-Groen, ContributorManaging Director, Better Than Cash Alliance",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/five-ways-digital-payment_b_10081834.html,"The ability to make and receive payments electronically has emerged, in recent years, as a technology hero during natural disasters and health pandemics. At a time when more people than ever are affected by conflict and crisis, there is good news.",2016-05-21,2016-05-21-1463842621-8451076-AfghanistanStudyPhoto.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-21-1463842621-8451076-AfghanistanStudyPhoto-thumb.jpg," Photo credit: United NationsThe ability to make and receive payments electronically has emerged, in recent years, as a technology hero during natural disasters and health pandemics. At a time when more people than ever are affected by conflict and crisis, there is good news. In many cases, payments through smart cards, mobile phones and even iris scans have enabled faster and more transparent emergency response work, transferring funds rapidly and safely in a way that cash and in-kind donations could not. As the first United Nations World Humanitarian Summit convenes in Istanbul next week, the theme of innovation in humanitarian emergencies will be front and center. Governments, aid organizations and the private sector should pay close attention to the power of digital payments. Here are five ways going digital has already come to the rescue. 1. Mobile Phone Wallets: Saving Money, Saving Lives in Sierra Leone The Ebola virus outbreak that began two years ago in West Africa claimed over 11,000 lives. In Sierra Leone, the government turned to an unexpected tool to help battle the virus: mobile wallets. A new UN report published today reveals that mobile payments to emergency workers dramatically shortened payment times and minimized fraud during the outbreak. By shifting from cash to digital, faster and more reliable payments prevented strikes which were seeing 800 working days lost from the Ebola Response Workforce each month. Preventing these strikes enabled health services to reach more families, ultimately saving more lives. Mobile wallets also stopped double payments and streamlined payments, saving the country more than US$10 million. That's enough to fund the country's healthcare program that serves 1.4 million children and 250,000 pregnant women each year. The experience of Sierra Leone and other members of the Better Than Cash Alliance - a UN-hosted partnership of governments, companies, and international organizations that accelerates the transition from cash to digital payments - offers a lesson for other governments: Invest in a solid mobile payment infrastructure before the next crisis strikes.   2. Iris Scans: Easing the Burden on Syrian Refugees  More than 4.7 million Syrians refugees are on the move. Neighboring countries such as Jordan now house more than 640,000 refugees. Jordan was the first country in the world to use iris scan technology to enable refugees to access monthly cash assistance provided by The UN Refugee Agency. This year, the World Food Programme started using the same technology to allow Syrian refugees living in camps to purchase food items from local shops and plans to expand the project into new camps, including the largest camp, Za'atari.   3. E-vouchers: Modernizing Food Aid in Afghanistan  Following decades of emergencies and conflicts in Afghanistan, the World Food Programme made the transition to electronic vouchers in 2014, instead of paper vouchers, to make food aid distribution more efficient and secure. This pilot e-voucher program was designed for people with low levels of literacy, including many women in Afghanistan. More than 70,000 beneficiaries are now receiving their stipends via e-voucher through mobile phones. The program has achieved impressive results and helped further financial inclusion among poor communities. One hundred percent of participants surveyed reported a seamless customer experience redeeming their e-vouchers at local stores, according to a new UN report. In addition, the government of Afghanistan is now expanding mobile money payments for salaries.   Photo credit: United Nations4. Crowdfunding platform: Responding to Natural Disasters in Bangladesh  Cash, checks and in-kind donations can be a logistical challenge when an unexpected natural disaster hits. Dhaka-based development organization BRAC has invested in an online platform to make it easier for people all over the world to make donations. The digital platform allows more people to seamlessly make contributions from their mobile phone, generating more donations and making a bigger impact.  For a country like Bangladesh that is prone to natural disasters, and has a large diaspora, these funds can play in critical role in helping families rebuild their lives. Floods and cyclones pose the greatest threat to Bangladesh, while earthquakes, droughts, and landslides frequently strike highly populated areas. Pooling funds and making it easier for people to become donors will ultimately make a difference to people facing disasters.   5. Debit cards: Rebuilding Chile after the Earthquake  In 2010, the world's fifth largest earthquake on record hit Chile, killing 720 people and destroying buildings and infrastructure. In response, the Chilean government and humanitarian agencies turned to digital payments to get their citizens and cities back on their feet. The Chilean Red Cross launched 'Tarjeta RED' - a debit card program to help families pay for basic needs or to repair their homes. Tarjeta RED debit cards created a more effective recovery process while also saving time and empowering recipients. These examples show how a range of digital payment types can fuel better, faster and more efficient emergency responses. We live in a world where technology is advancing rapidly and tools such as mobile phones are becoming ubiquitous, even for those who live on less than a few dollars a day. At the same time, there are more crises unfolding than ever before. The time is right for governments, humanitarian organizations and the private sector alike to invest in the infrastructure and create a policy environment that allows these digital payment tools to save and rebuild lives."

Bill Haslam (R) allowed a bill to become law on Friday.The law, pushed by state Republicans, bars UT Knoxville from putting any state funds toward Sex Week, and defunds the school's office of diversity and inclusion. Instead, the $436,000 that would've gone to the diversity office will be rerouted to support engineering scholarships.The law also explicitly prohibits the university from using state funds to ""promote the use of gender neutral pronouns.""Haslam allowed the bill to become law by failing to either veto or sign the legislation, the Knoxville News Sentinel reports. The legislation passed the Tennessee Senate and House in April.The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, a nonprofit, has argued in the past that legislation banning the university from putting money toward Sex Week, based solely on the nature of the event, would be a violation of free speech rights. Tennessee lawmakers have been trying for years to thwart the student-run Sex Week, proposing several bills intended to block the event from happening. There have been no protests on campus against Sex Week, nor any mass effort by the community to stop it -- lawmakers simply believe the event is inappropriate for adults. Students did protest on campus in April against the bill that has now become law.The university doesn't provide funding for Sex Week, so in 2014, the state legislature pressured the school into requiring students to ""opt in"" to paying fees that support all student-organized events. Sex Week typically features forums and workshops about different types of sexuality and sexual orientation, teaching students about consent, healthy relationships, body image and other types of sexual education students might not have gotten in middle school or high school.Tennessee lawmakers targeted the promotion of gender-neutral pronouns, used for people who do not identify as either male or female, following erroneous reports that the school was banning the use of the pronouns ""he"" and ""she."" It was not -- the now-defunded diversity office was simply providing information to students about what gender-neutral pronouns are, and when someone might request their use.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article said that the new law requires the University of Tennessee to put about $100,000 toward creating decals for cop cars. In fact, that provision was not included in the final version of the legislation._______Tyler Kingkade is a national reporter covering higher education, and is based in New York.

Lois Beckett, a Guardian US senior reporter covering gun policy and politics, tweeted Friday that she was denied access to the event held at the Kentucky Exposition Center. She's instead reported from outside the gathering, for instance writing on NRA members skeptical about presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump, who addressed the crowd Friday afternoon in Freedom Hall. The NRA's official news feed has even promoted her coverage.Guardian US Head of News David Taylor said the NRA declined their credential request on the grounds that the organization is a foreign media outlet, a characterization he rejected. An NRA spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. The Guardian, a nearly 200-year-old British newspaper and global news site, launched Guardian US in 2011 as a digital-first, U.S.-facing news operation. The Pulitzer Prize board permitted Guardian US into its awards competition the following year, noting that the site ""had established a substantial and distinctive presence in the United States with operations in New York.” It won the prestigious Public Service prize in 2014. ""When we won a Pulitzer, we thought that argument had been resolved,"" Taylor told HuffPost regarding where Guardian US is based. ""We are an American news organization covering America for an American audience.""A Guardian spokeswoman stressed that The Guardian, more broadly, should not be considered a foreign outlet given its global reach and operations outside the U.K. ""There is a misconception that the Guardian is a foreign news outlet,"" she said in an email. ""In fact, the Guardian is a global news organization with very strong US operations comprising offices in New York, Washington D.C. and San Francisco, as well as a nationwide team of dedicated journalists."" The U.S.-based operation has put significant resources into covering issues surrounding guns in America, including hiring Beckett from ProPublica in February.

His brother is a U.S. senator, and he's from a state where Trump is doing terribly in the polls.

They don't trust his ideological bearings. So he just gave them tangible evidence -- in the form of names -- that he shares their judicial philosophy.But there's a side effect to what he's done that could translate to long-term legislative benefits if the GOP presidential front-runner ends up in the Oval Office.Nearly everyone on Trump's list has close ties to Republican senators. As Politico reported, one potential nominee is a close acquaintance of Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas). Another is a former professor of Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.). Another is a longtime favorite of Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa). Thomas Lee, a Utah Supreme Court justice, is the brother of Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah.).In life under President Trump, it's not hard to imagine that these senators would consider the prospect of seeing their old friend, mentor or brother appointed to the Supreme Court (or, conversely, removed from Trump's list) when weighing the White House's legislative agenda.This is precisely why it's rare to see a presidential candidate release a list of potential Supreme Court nominees before ever getting elected. There's an ethical dimension to using a sitting judge as barter for something else -- even if it just looks that way.""Half of judicial ethics isn't impropriety as much as the appearance of impropriety,"" said Russell Wheeler, an expert on courts and judicial selection at the Brookings Institution. ""It creates the sense of, 'Maybe they're trying to curry favor with the president,' even if it's not true.""Of course, it's all part of the veneer that courts are above politics and that the nomination process to fill court vacancies is apolitical. But Wheeler says he was still shocked by the arrangement Trump came up with.""It gave me pause,"" he said. ""The fact is, Mike Lee might be above reproach and his brother may be above reproach, but the very fact that you and I can wonder about that, it creates problems. With Utah, there's a lot of Mormon Church opposition to Trump. There's talk that Clinton might be able to swing that very red state. You don't have to be too bright to figure out what might be going on there.""Other political observers didn't think it was as big of a deal, if only because they don't see the court nomination process as void of political considerations.""What else is new?"" asked Ken Gross, a D.C.-based lawyer who specializes in congressional ethics and the regulation of political activity. ""You do things to ingratiate yourself to senators and others to garner their support. I think that that's an upside for Trump ... It's politics as usual. You use as much leverage as you can.""Trump himself may see his Supreme Court nominee list as a political vehicle. Most of his picks hail from swing states or states that Trump would clearly like to put in play as he makes a Rust Belt push in the general election. As Chris Geidner of BuzzFeed pointed out, nearly half of the people on Trump's list are on state courts, compared to the current composition of the Supreme Court, where three members came from the D.C. Circuit and four were from other federal appeals courts.There's another reason to think that politics (yes, politics!) is part of Trump's Supreme Court thinking. His names were cobbled together with the help of the right-leaning Federalist Society as a means of saying, essentially, that these were the ideological bounds of the acceptable. But since then, Trump has said he would ""add to the list"" -- an addendum that has made his skeptics nervous and given an incentive to other senators to push their personal favorites.While that may not be the way the public likes to think a Supreme Court seat is filled, some legal observers aren't surprised it's playing out this way.""Pretty much the only thing we know is that he wants to win. So, in that case, whatever strategy works to secure confirmation will be what matters,"" said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University who focuses on federal judicial matters.""Does that mean he might dangle a potential nomination of Sen. Lee's brother to try to induce Lee's vote on other issues? Or Cornyn's or Grassley's for some other favored nominee? Possibly. And would that be unseemly in some way?"" she asked. ""Presidents and senators make calculations all the time about the price for votes. Is it much different than committing to limiting citrus imports to get a Florida lawmaker's vote for a trade deal?""Well, it is a lifetime appointment to the most powerful court in the country.""I'd say it's a difference in degree, rather than in kind,"" said Binder.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
27,TECH,The Supercomputer That Won Jeopardy Is Now Helping California Save Water,Casey Williams,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ibm-watson-california-water_us_573f2e9ae4b045cc9a70c0f1,Watson is letting local authorities know who’s overusing the scarce resource.,2016-05-20,"IBM's Watson is helping track water use in California, which has suffered from severe drought. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573f35671a00002f00c292f1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"IBM’s Watson is pitching in to tackle California’s drought.The supercomputer, which may be best known for destroying human opponents in Jeopardy, has been enlisted by environmental consulting firm OmniEarth to track water use across California.OmniEarth announced the partnership on Friday. But for over a month, the company has been tapping into Watson’s computing power to scan satellite and aerial images of California’s lush valleys and barren deserts to figure out how Californians are using their dwindling water reserves.Even without OmniEarth or Watson's help, Californians are working to track and cut down their water consumption. Since January, the state has required farmers and ranchers who hold long-time water rights to monitor their water consumption using meters and gauges. Just this week, the state lifted certain restrictions on water use. OmniEarth says Watson is valuable because it can track water use across the state at warp speed. Instead of laboring for several hours to scan 150,000 images, OmniEarth can tap Watson to process those images in 12 minutes, according to Jonathan Fentzke, chief strategy officer at OmniEarth. “We can do the whole U.S., all 144 million parcels, in hours,” Fentzke told The Huffington Post. OmniEarth provides its water use data to 90 local government agencies in California, including the City of Folsom and the East Bay Municipal Water District. The local authorities then use that data to draft water budgets and crack down on excessive water users in the area.To get information about water use, Watson uses “visual recognition” to scan images of land parcels for valuable information, according to Pesenti.But unlike less-powerful image detection software, Watson doesn't just identify a specific object -- say, a crop field -- in an image. Instead, it combs through lots and lots of information about the image -- like the objects it contains and the colors of those objects -- and uses that information to ""understand"" the image as a whole. In the case of OmniEarth, researchers can use Watson not just to determine if a given parcel of land contains a crop field, but also to calculate the exact amount of water used by that parcel based on all of the information contained in the photo.What's more, Watson doesn’t need to know much about water consumption to tell OmniEarth if people are using too much water. Using machine learning, Watson can scan lots of images and, over time, figure out what aspects of those images are most important.“Watson doesn’t know anything about water usage or Earth images,”Jerome Pesenti, vice president of IBM's Watson platform, told HuffPost. “But if you give it some training images, the system can take those as examples and learn from them.”That means OmniEarth can cut down on the amount of human labor needed to track water use. “Because of machine learning, we don’t necessarily need humans in the loop,” Fentzke said. “When when policy or other things change, we just automatically update it.”With accurate, real-time water consumption data, OmniEarth says it can help water authorities develop customized water budgets for cities and towns based on how much water households, industries and farms are actually using. It can also help governments crack down on people or companies that flout water restrictions, according to Fentzke.“It makes for more efficient outreach,” Fentzke said. “They can target messages to users who might not be aware that they’re overusing water.”The company has already seen some early success in California. Thanks in part to Watson's super fast calculations, there’s been a 15 percent reduction in water consumption among some of OmniEarth's clients, according to Fentzke.Reductions like that are a big deal in California, where water scarcity remains a major concern. While California announced on Wednesday that it would be lifting some water restrictions, water shortages continue to plague cities and counties across the state, especially in drier southern California.Watson made its public debut in 2011, when it used its computing skills and ability to parse language to crush two Jeopardy champions. Since then, IBM has converted Watson into a cloud-based computing platform that anyone can pay to tap into. The platform's basic appeal is its ability to suck up huge amounts of raw data and convert it into useful information, according to Pesenti.“There’s all this very unstructured information out there, and you need some tools to be able to extract understanding out of that information,” Pesenti said. “I think OmniEarth is a great example of how people can leverage the platform for their own needs.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated that IBM's Watson has defeated humans opponents in the game ""Go.""

28,TECH,The Supercomputer That Won Jeopardy Is Now Helping California Save Water,Casey Williams,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ibm-watson-california-water_us_573f2e9ae4b045cc9a70c0f1,Watson is letting local authorities know who’s overusing the scarce resource.,2016-05-20,Visual recognition can help researchers tell whether a parcel of land is using too much water.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573f34c91a00002f00c292ee.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"IBM’s Watson is pitching in to tackle California’s drought.The supercomputer, which may be best known for destroying human opponents in Jeopardy, has been enlisted by environmental consulting firm OmniEarth to track water use across California.OmniEarth announced the partnership on Friday. But for over a month, the company has been tapping into Watson’s computing power to scan satellite and aerial images of California’s lush valleys and barren deserts to figure out how Californians are using their dwindling water reserves.Even without OmniEarth or Watson's help, Californians are working to track and cut down their water consumption. Since January, the state has required farmers and ranchers who hold long-time water rights to monitor their water consumption using meters and gauges. Just this week, the state lifted certain restrictions on water use. OmniEarth says Watson is valuable because it can track water use across the state at warp speed. Instead of laboring for several hours to scan 150,000 images, OmniEarth can tap Watson to process those images in 12 minutes, according to Jonathan Fentzke, chief strategy officer at OmniEarth. “We can do the whole U.S., all 144 million parcels, in hours,” Fentzke told The Huffington Post. OmniEarth provides its water use data to 90 local government agencies in California, including the City of Folsom and the East Bay Municipal Water District. The local authorities then use that data to draft water budgets and crack down on excessive water users in the area.To get information about water use, Watson uses “visual recognition” to scan images of land parcels for valuable information, according to Pesenti.But unlike less-powerful image detection software, Watson doesn't just identify a specific object -- say, a crop field -- in an image. Instead, it combs through lots and lots of information about the image -- like the objects it contains and the colors of those objects -- and uses that information to ""understand"" the image as a whole. In the case of OmniEarth, researchers can use Watson not just to determine if a given parcel of land contains a crop field, but also to calculate the exact amount of water used by that parcel based on all of the information contained in the photo.What's more, Watson doesn’t need to know much about water consumption to tell OmniEarth if people are using too much water.

The court ordered the agency to produce and implement stronger and more expansive regulations that lead to the ""type of mass-based reductions in greenhouse gases"" that the state legislature called for in a 2008 law.""This is an historic victory for young generations advocating for changes to be made by government,"" 17-year-old plaintiff Shamus Miller said in a statement. ""The global climate change crisis is a threat to the well-being of humanity, and to my generation, that has been ignored for too long.""The verdict in Kain v. Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection comes just weeks after another group of young people forced Washington state to craft science-based emission rules this year. The King County judge there ruled that the urgency of climate change and the government’s responsibility to protect citizens required that the state Department of Ecology be held to a deadline.Earlier in April, 21 young plaintiffs scored a significant victory when the U.S. District Court in Eugene, Oregon, denied the federal government and fossil fuel industry’s motions to dismiss a lawsuit over the harms of climate change. The plaintiffs contend that their constitutional rights are being violated by the ongoing failure to curb greenhouse gas emissions, even as officials have known about the climate change link for decades.Our Children’s Trust, a nonprofit advocacy group backing the plaintiffs in Massachusetts, Washington and Oregon, said a trend is emerging.""In agreeing with the youth plaintiffs in this case, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court joins growing global judicial recognition of youth’s rights to demand that their governments act in accordance with the urgency of the climate change crisis,"" Julia Olson, the trust's executive director and chief legal counsel, said in a statement this week.""The judicial branch of our government has a critical role to play given the state of climate change,"" Olson told HuffPost in April. ""It has a job to hold the other branches of our government accountable.""Along with the aforementioned litigation, Our Children’s Trust has cases before state courts in Oregon, Colorado and North Carolina and in several other countries.In the Massachusetts suit, the youths argued that the environmental agency was not doing enough to reach targets set in 2008 under the state's Global Warming Solutions Act. That law called for reducing greenhouse gas emissions 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 and 80 percent below by 2050 -- goals that the Massachusetts supreme court noted were based on the best available science about addressing climate change.The agency rolled out some new regulations, notably a regional cap-and-trade program, rules to limit emissions of sulfur hexafluoride, and a low-emissions vehicle program. However, the state is not on track to meet its targets. A 2015 state report found that Massachusetts could meet its 2020 goal only if the state legislature passed a bill requiring utilities to solicit long-term contracts for hydroelectric power, which has not yet happened.Overturning a lower court ruling that found the environmental agency’s plan was sufficient, Justice Robert Cordy wrote that the state’s regulations ""fall short of complying with the requirements ... because they fail to ensure the type of mass-based reductions in greenhouse gases across the sources or categories of sources regulated under each of the programs, as intended by the Legislature.""The state was reviewing the court's decision, said Edmund Coletta Jr., director of public affairs for the Department of Environmental Protection, in a statement. The agency, he said, “remains committed to meeting the Global Warming Solutions Act goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 25 percent below 1990 levels by 2020, as well as achieving greater reductions for 2030 and beyond."""

I hadn’t noticed,” Mueller told The Huffington Post. Ultimately, she believes her oversight is a positive thing: “Everybody was there simply because they were the best person for the job.”To her point, few new Broadway musicals boast such an impressive pedigree. “Waitress,” which is based on Adrienne Shelly’s 2007 film of the same name, is directed by Diane Paulus, who nabbed a Tony Award for the 2013 revival of “Pippin.” Choreographer Lorin Latarro, who worked on the immersive theater sensation, “Queen of the Night,” was brought in to give the cast slick moves, while Jessie Nelson (""I Am Sam"") provided the book. Then, of course, there’s the anthemic, pop-rock score, written by Grammy-nominated singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles.“Waitress” finds its heartbeat, however, in Mueller. The 33-year-old singer-actress brings undeniable warmth and charm to the role of Jenna Hunterson, a waitress and pie-making aficionado at a small-town diner who feels trapped in a loveless relationship with an abusive husband (Nick Cordero). After discovering that she’s pregnant, Jenna finds herself in a surprise affair with her gynecologist (Drew Gehling), and sets out on a journey of self re-discovery with the help of a few imaginative pie recipes.Mueller, who hails from Evanston, Illinois, first played the role in a 2014 workshop during her Tony-winning run as Carole King in the smash musical, “Beautiful,” and said she connected to the “inherent goodness” of Jenna, portrayed by Keri Russell in the 2007 film.“There’s something about her soul that I just really loved,” Mueller said. “There’s a lot of pain there, but there’s also a lot of strength. That really appealed to me.”Before “Waitress” began its out-of-town run in Cambridge, Massachusetts last August, Mueller spent time with victims of sexual and domestic violence at the Mount Sinai Sexual Assault and Violence Intervention (SAVI) program in New York. That process, she said, was an “interesting challenge” that allowed her to get inside Jenna’s head but made her feel “blessed to not know what that’s like firsthand.” Mueller wants audiences to see her portrayal of Jenna as a cautionary, albeit uplifting, tale that’s told with plenty of humor. Though “Waitress” tackles a number of serious themes, it offers its star plenty of opportunities to show off her comedic chops, too. In fact, Mueller said her favorite number is not her centerpiece ballad, “She Used to Be Mine,” but rather the sexy “Bad Idea,” which finds Jenna and her doctor in flagrante delicto atop an examination table.Discovering those nuggets of comic relief, she said, was “hugely satisfying” and strengthened the musical's redemptive message. “In today’s society, I still think young women are taught to stay out of the way, take care of everybody else and not put themselves first,” she said. “I think it’s really important for women to see a character who has not taken care of herself, but then see that person taking control again and experiencing a redemption.”Certainly, that work has paid off. The show, which opened on April 25, received four Tony Award nominations, including Best Musical and Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical for Mueller.Pointing to her Tony victory for “Beautiful” just two years ago, Mueller is refreshingly modest about the critical raves she’s received for “Waitress."" Still, she said, “To be recognized for this show, which we have worked so hard on and I love so much… I feel really, really lucky."" Given that ""Waitress"" arrived at a time when the need for diverse narratives has dominated the cultural discourse around show business, Mueller said she is proud to be associated with a musical that's embraced a female perspective wholeheartedly. “If young women can look at this show and say, ‘Oh, I can be a book writer, I can be a director, I can be a choreographer,’ that’s such a great thing, because it hasn’t happened before,” she said. “I hope that people are just more open than ever to hiring the best person for the job, no matter what their gender or their sexual orientation or their race is, and that we’re finally getting to a point where we are inclusive and not taking anyone out of the equation.”"
