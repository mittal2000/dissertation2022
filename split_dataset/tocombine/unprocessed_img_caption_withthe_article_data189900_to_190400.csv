This gala was more than trending celebrities or whoever has the most followers on Twitter; the guest list included a range of musicians, politicians, media notables, and people around the world who have made a real impact on society. The venue was beautiful, jazzy, and garnished with its fair share of U.S. Secret Service agents and their K-9 colleagues.I was one of the first to enter, and I was warmly greeted by the stone-faced agents. I emptied my pockets and strolled through the metal detectors with confidence. Luckily I kept my medical marijuana and nail-clipper at home, because these guys meant business.Once I got through security, I was able to spend a few minutes chatting with Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton. The Clintons were actually our summer neighbors on Martha's Vineyard approximately 12 years ago. I bumped into Bill on the Vineyard and asked him to hold my then-one-year-old baby daughter Lauren. Naturally, my daughter kicked and screamed, he quickly handed her back (she didn't care if he was president of anything). Mrs. Clinton responded with some of her own recollections from the island. She summarized her sand-filled memory lane with, ""We had great times there."" When I asked if she had been there recently she said no, ""I really miss it; we need to get back there soon.""Now a man I didn't expect to see at the event, New York Archbishop Timothy Dolan -- yes, the Pope's righthand man, or at least one of his fingers. I don't know how religion ties in with the media, or photo ops, or if it was just paranoia of being banished to hell, but I bee-lined it straight through the crowd for my handshake anyway. My tone gave away the ignorance to religious protocol when I asked for a photo, but he smiled and said, ""It would be my honor"" (with all due respect Cardinal, I think you have that flipped). The Cardinal placed me in a comfortable headlock as we cheesed it up for a few pictures. At this point, I had no reservation about frolicking amongst the other top 100 people of the world, most I've never heard of. I soon after spotted a guy posing for photos in front of a massive face-canvas. It took a minute to register that the two faces were one in the same, Pete Cashmore, the CEO and Founder of Mashable.com. He was one of the honored 100, but still had to rely on his smoking hot girlfriend/professional photographer Lisa Bettany for his mini photo shoot. The man could crush me, metaphorically speaking, with his digital/philanthropic innovations, yet I decided to call him out on it. Was he embarrassed? Not at all, Instead, we both jumped in and struck our best poses in front of his face.Noticeably missing party notables on the TIME 100 list were President Obama, Mitt Romney, Warren Buffett and Pippa Middleton.Next up was a young woman on the 100 list named Manan Al Sharif, who should have been on Cosmo's Fun And Fearless list too, for defying a driving ban for woman in Saudi Arabia by cruising around in her car or something. I only know this because I Googled her name when I got home, it's not like they all walked around wearing their accomplishments on a name-tag that night. While I floundered around in conversation trying to figure out why she was on the list, she jokingly asked, ''Will you mention that you met a hot Saudi girl in your article?'' Glad I didn't disappoint. This is about the time Hilary and T.C. Dolan bounced from the scene. The Secret Service soon followed, bringing their fancy metal detectors and furry friends with them. Guess it was every man for himself from there on.A conservatively dressed Rihanna then performed a song to wrap up the evening, or so I thought. This is when the after party kicked into gear, hosted by Korean Air (yeah, I didn't know they sponsored stuff either). I briefly hung out with Louis C.K., Emmy and Grammy Award-winning stand-up comedian, talking about his FX series and a couple of FX family members, Russell Brand and Charlie Sheen. C.K. expressed some disappointment in missing Sheen and Brand at the FX Upfront event we attended together -- I assured him that he didn't miss much.The party was winding down, so I decided to call it a night and hopped into the elevator with Mr. C.K and SNL's version of Hilary Clinton, Amy Poehler. Upon exiting the box, we were met with 20 or so loitering fans stalking the exit elevators. Obviously I had nothing to worry about, but I did spot Victor Cruz making a mad dash for his car."

""I feel like the anti-bride, because I watch all those shows and I hate them,"" she said at Project Sunshine's Benefit in New York City. ""I go out of my way to try not to be too annoying ... my biggest goal in life is to not be annoying about being a bride.""But while Teigen may be the furthest thing from a bridezilla, she's still very much into her Big Day details. For example, Teigen said that she didn't waste time when picking out her ""simple"" and ""stunning"" designer gown by Monique Lhuillier. ""I had been looking online for so long ... since the day I got engaged,"" Teigen said. ""It's so beautiful. I loved it. That was my excuse for having not waited. I don't know what part [of the wedding] it will be worn for, but it will be worn and I'm very excited.""In addition to dress shopping, Teigen revealed that she also loves talking about wedding food. ""That's what makes me happy,"" she said. But, she added, ""If you tell me to do a guest list, I cry. I hate it,"" she said. Legend won't be a groomzilla when it comes to their nuptials, either. Teigen told OK! magazine in February, ""He's not an anything zilla. I try to get him to be a zilla sometimes. He doesn’t care about much. It won't be all me either because I’m a panic attacker, it’s all on our planner.""The pair, who have been dating since 2007, got engaged over the holidays while vacationing in the Maldives. They have yet to set the date.Below, photos of Legend and Teigen throughout their relationship:Keep in touch! Check out HuffPost Weddings on Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest."

4,STYLE & BEAUTY,Throw a Last-Minute Cinco De Mayo Party and Not Be a Caliente Mess!,"Courtney Cachet, Contributor
Media Personality, Celebrity Designer, Style Expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/throw-a-last-minute-cinco-de-mayo-party_us_5b9baa9ee4b03a1dcc796f91,"I love Cinco De Mayo! I mean, duh -- tacos, margaritas, colorful décor. What's not to love?",2012-05-04,2012-05-04-558753_375923315783278_109002869141992_967811_2081385877_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-05-04-558753_375923315783278_109002869141992_967811_2081385877_n.jpg,"I LOVE Cinco De Mayo! I mean, duh -- tacos, margaritas, colorful décor. What's not to love? So I say, whether you want to take it outside or throw this fab fiesta indoors, throwing a Cinco de Mayo party should be like good Mexican food truck grub: Easy, cheap and cool! First thing first: Food! I recommend going to the store and buying some ground beef, turkey or fish, along with all the fixin's for some fabulous tacos. Make a little taco station and have your guests build their own tacos. They can make them to their liking, which leaves you off the hook for extra work -- and gives you more time for margaritas! You can also add some Mexican rice, chili, those little empanadas you can get at Trader Joe's, and a salad. Then finish up with some dulce de leche ice cream for dessert and you're done. Can you tell how much I love Mexican food?When it comes to drinks, I say keep it simple and easy by making a big ol' batch of margaritas. I recently discovered this machine called the Margaritaville Mixed Drink Maker, and oh-em-gee, it's the bomb! It's not cheap -- the price tag runs about $299 -- but I highly recommend it if you entertain a lot. Plus, Cachet loves all things self-serve, and this definitely fits the bill! Obviously have a few non-alcoholic beverages on hand as well -- and don't forget the water. You'll need something to counteract the delicious-yet-salty chips and salsa. And, of course, if you want to make your event more family-friendly, just omit the tequila or make virgin margaritas. Simple!For all your décor needs, I went to Party City and went to town, but you could hit up any craft store or discount retailer. They have everything you need right there, and the prices are very affordable. What I love about Cinco de Mayo party supplies is how flexible they are: Not only are they bold-colored and festive, but moreover, whatever you don't use now you can easily reuse for other parties throughout the summer.My shopping list is below. I purchased an overabundance of stuff for six place settings and spent about $250, but you could easily do it for much less.Either way, I hope you have a rockin' Cinco de Mayo party!
