I dream of one day owning a DeGiulio kitchen sink. Sleek, sexy and oh-so functional, they're the kind of sinks that make you want to jump up and cut some onions. So when House Beautiful unveiled its Kitchen of the Year designed by Mick DeGiulio, I wanted to snatch up a whole bag of Vidalias and head for his countertops. But alas, I was stuck on the shores of the Puget Sound, unable to attend the event. So I did the next best thing and rang him up, to learn as much as I possibly could from America's premier dream kitchen designer and innovator. While you may not have heard of him, there's a good chance your kitchen has been inspired by Chicago-based Mick DeGiulio. His ""Kitchen Centric"" concept of turning kitchens into complete living spaces has revolutionized kitchen design. With comfortable seating, family-style dining, open-living concepts and maximum efficiency -- all beautifully detailed with natural materials, neutral palettes, and exquisite beauty -- the Kitchen Centric approach to home design turns the kitchen into the heart and soul of the family home.What sets this kitchen apart from the others that you've designed?In every kitchen I do, I try to make it a little different and a lot different. I think of my job as really trying to translate who the client is, what they are about, in terms of an aesthetic, a feel, and put that back into the space. With an exhibit like this, I'm not working with someone and I don't get that feedback. So what I tried to do was kind of indulge in an idea of it being my own space, my own kitchen. I've always had this idea that I'd like to build a house some day; something very simple, just one room, a kitchen. A living area, kitchen combined, and it doesn't need to be big. I love what Picasso said, when he talked about the idea that he wanted to be a rich man who lived like a poor man. And I think that to me it means that no matter how much money you would have, that a good, simple life is really what we all aim for and the idea of a kitchen, living area is a simple life, because you don't have all these rooms and areas to live in or upkeep. So that was the basis of the plan and it's also what I think people want, a kitchen you can live in. And the biggest story right now in kitchens is lifestyle and how people want to live in those spaces. So I wanted this to be kind of my kitchen, my space, a fantasy of this light-filled space that they gave me [to work in]. It was a kitchen that was a living space with a breakfast area and a soft-seating area, a table that you could still have breakfast on, which has an area for relaxing, but you could eat in if you wanted to. But the total room is about a thousand square feet, and it's a living space! It's a kitchen. It's got a flavor to it that is just comfortable, warm and just a whole living environment.When you mention the breakfast room, was that the room called ""La Matina""?The ""La Matina"" [which means ""the morning"" in Italian] is a zone inside of the kitchen, like a breakfast station. The idea was inspired by one of my clients who wanted the kids to be able to have an area where they could make breakfast on their own. It's just too far to go from the breakfast area to the work zone, so it's almost a quasi-kitchen that has a coffee maker, toaster, toaster oven, and a service area where you can go back and forth from the breakfast table and easily close by.What's your most exciting feature of this new kitchen?One is an element that I call ""Metal Boy"" and it's a tall cabinet with glass doors that are framed with polished stainless steel, and inside is a metal lined interior of German silver, which is a beautiful nickel silver material that's very distressed. It has a pot rack on the inside of the cabinet, so that when you look in through the glass doors, you see all of your pots and pans hanging on the rail and its all lighted with LED lights and at night [it becomes a] night light in the kitchen. It creates almost a sculpture of the pots and pans within a cabinet. It makes it easy to see and reach and access those things. And there's also a lid-dividing cabinet below, so you have all the lids divided and no clanging when you open the cabinet and grab your pots and pans. They're all easily accessible and not meshed into each other.It's almost as if your kitchens are not only responding to the emotions and personalities of your clients, but that those kitchens must create new emotions and even lifestyles. Do you get much feedback from your clients after they've lived in your kitchens for awhile, about how it might have changed their approach to food and their lifestyle?Oh, absolutely, all the time! You know, I think one of the most gratifying parts of my job is exactly that. When I see people five years later and they'll say, 'Thank you for telling me to do that and insisting that we do whatever it was that we did.' Or they kind of welcome me as a part of the family because I was a part of the project and they lived with that space every day. The karma of the project lives on. One of the features of your kitchens that I really like is the butler pantry. Can you tell me about how you use them and how popular they are?People love butler's pantries. I love them. At first I think of them as a quirky space because they're usually kind of shoehorned in between the dining room and the kitchen, and a lot of the butler pantries in homes I work in that were designed by David Adler have great mixes of materials, like zinc sinks, or countertops made of wood that are practical for the butler's kitchen because you have china and glassware there and it's softer and you don't have things chipping as easily. They just are that great mix of utility and elegance between those two spaces, and when people see them they go back to their architects and say they want one.I see them as a brilliant use of space, and it doesn't require a whole lot of space.No, exactly. Like a closet. You don't need a lot. But they're jewels.Mick DeGiulio has a number of jewels in his kitchens, from elegant traditional chandeliers hanging in sleek, modern kitchens to the sliding back splash, where all those spices, oils and cooking appliances can be hidden away behind the walls. There's no end of the surprises in a DeGiulio kitchen, and the surprises are so beautiful and ingenious that even if you can't have a dream kitchen of your own just yet, you can find great ideas just by perusing the jewels and hidden surprises in his fabulous designs.For more about Mick DeGiulio's kitchens, take a look at his decadent design book, Kitchen Centric.

Next up, more of my interview with Mick DeGiulio, as he discusses the future of kitchen design, his favorite materials, and for those whose budgets can't quite include the most luxurious kitchens in the world, how you can apply some of his Kitchen Centric concepts and design innovations in your own home.
