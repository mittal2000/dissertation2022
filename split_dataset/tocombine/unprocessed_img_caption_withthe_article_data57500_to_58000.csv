3,POLITICS,Trump Earned His Stratospheric Negatives -- But What About Hillary?,"Earl Ofari Hutchinson, ContributorAuthor and political analyst",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-earned-his-stratosp_b_9864776.html,"It will take every ounce of Democratic Party unity, money, time, and energy, and a massive turnout from core Democrats and centrist independents, to offset the gutter attacks that will be tossed at Clinton.",2016-05-08,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks to supporters during a rally at La Escuelita School in Oakland, California, on May 6, 2016. / AFP / GABRIELLE LURIE (Photo credit should read GABRIELLE LURIE/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb93c68260000360083d7e1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A recent Reuters poll found that nearly half of voters will vote for Trump or Clinton not because they like either one of them, or because of anything that they have to say about the issues that have moved them. They'll simply back one or the other out of naked fear and loathing of Clinton or Trump in the White House. The distaste is no surprise in Trump's case. His negatives have flat lined at monumental highs almost from the moment that he declared his presidential candidacy last June. But how to explain the huge dislike of Clinton? The obvious start is the very open, well honed and relentless GOP attack plan to nail her. It was scripted by the Republican National Committee long before she announced her 2016 presidential run. The plan was to put teams on the ground in Arkansas and anywhere else Hillary and Bill had put their political and personal footprints, then dig up every scintilla of old and new dirt it could dredge up to try and render her candidacy -- stillborn before it even became an official candidacy. The RNC planned to churn out inflammatory and defamatory videos reminding voters of the old scandals the GOP worked over endlessly to hammer Hillary on -- from Whitewater to the Lewinsky scandal, and her tout of health care reform, which was the prelude to the much harangued Affordable Care Act. That is the past. The GOP now with the leadership of numerous House Committees could reel off and spend millions of dollars and hours on trumped up investigation after trumped up investigation to hit Clinton on her alleged coverup in the Benghazi debacle and her alleged misuse of emails as Secretary of State. The aim is to embarrass and discredit her not because of her alleged missteps as Secretary of State, but as a 2016 presidential candidate. At the very least, with much of the press obsessively sniffing around and then headlining every spiff of rumor, including gossip and dirt about the emails and Benghazi, helped to paint the picture in the minds of many of Clinton as a liar, cheat and generally untrustworthy candidate. It was a short step from that to Trump to pouncing and minting Clinton as ""Crooked Hillary"" on the campaign stump. This took a toll. Clinton started out with relatively high favorability ratings in the months just before she announced that she was a 2016 candidate. However, the steady drumbeat of attacks has driven her unpopularity numbers steadily on an upward trajectory. When the GOP and Trump turn the smear guns on her in the run-up to November, the negatives could continue to march higher. It will take every ounce of Democratic Party unity, money, time, and energy, and a massive turnout from core Democrats and centrist independents, to offset the gutter attacks that will be tossed at Clinton. The image assault on Clinton won't end with the hit on her as a presidential candidate. Trump and the GOP will eternally remind voters that her past, her views and her political style, will supposedly tag her as a hopelessly tainted and compromised president and this will hamstring her effectiveness in getting things done. The GOP-controlled House and maybe even the Senate would wage brutal war against every piece of legislation, initiative she'd propose and every key administration appointment and judicial appointment, especially to the Supreme Court that she'd make. The message being that ""untrustworthy"" Clinton in the Oval Office will not be able to get much done no matter her agenda with Congress, and the big loser will be the country. A big trap for Clinton would be to get into a name calling match with Trump. A dirty, negative campaign by her would play into Trump and the GOP's hands since he's already been mocked, ridiculed, impugned and laughed at with any and every imaginable personal and political insult. More name calling wouldn't do anything to further damage his unshakeable stratospheric negatives in many circles. But that's not the case with Clinton, it would reinforce the image of Clinton doubters that she is the terrible Clinton that the GOP has been working overtime for years to sell the public on. This is not conjecture. A 2014 Pew Research Center study confirmed what many Americans have long said and long hated and that's that politics has gotten dirtier, more personal, and more embarrassing, and the candidates that engage in that are a plain turn off. A big swatch of both Democrats and Republicans flatly said that they see the other side ""as threat to the nation's well-being.""The political and image assault on Clinton has been so relentless and brutal that sadly many now see her as part of that threat. Enough anyway to say they'll vote for Trump to keep her out of the White House.Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

4,MEDIA,40 Years Ago the Unthinkable Happened,"Greg D. Williams, M.A. , ContributorGreg D. Williams, M.A.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/40-years-ago-the-unthinka_b_9864358.html,"May 9, 1976 was ground-breaking. Many people walking among us today are now entering their 40th year of long-term recovery as a result of this far reaching public awareness effort, dubbed Operation Understanding, and the coverage that followed.",2016-05-08,2016-05-08-1462708869-4169946-OperationUnderstanding.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-05-08-1462708869-4169946-OperationUnderstanding-thumb.jpg,"Forty years ago today, on May 9, 1976, an unusual press conference was held at the old Shoreham Americana Hotel in Washington, D.C.The story grabbed the attention of national media cameras and the next day appeared in many newspapers across the country as it was thought to be the moment that would forever change the way people with alcoholism were perceived.Never before was there such a public attack on the stigma of addiction. An incredible collection of famous and influential people gathered shoulder-to-shoulder to put a public face to this largely neglected health issue. Never before had a famous television actor stood in a hazy, smoke-filled hotel ballroom and not only talked not only about his own addiction and recovery, but also explained that ""addiction is a disease, one that can afflict anyone.""That actor was Dick Van Dyke. Buzz Aldrin, the second man to step foot on the moon, was there. So was Don Newcombe, the first Major League Baseball pitcher to win the Cy Young award, and Gary Moore, the beloved television host of ""To Tell The Truth"".May 9, 1976 was ground-breaking. Many people walking among us today are now entering their 40th year of long-term recovery as a result of this far reaching public awareness effort, dubbed Operation Understanding, and the coverage that followed.As a 29-year-old filmmaker who was born seven years after 1976 I was working on an independent project about the emerging public recovery advocacy movement for the film The Anonymous People. It was 2012 when I was told about this moment from the historians I was interviewing. I was shocked. How could this have happened? I had spent the better part of the previous three years trying to engage public figures to sit in front of my camera and tell their addiction and recovery stories with only modest success. Due to the persistent stigma many still wished to remain private, and most viewed even their own addiction and recovery stories as largely an individual process - not from a system or community perspective.I searched and found the tape archives for footage of this historic press event. As I watched the news footage and read more about the 1976 event, I remember thinking ""who are these people?"" You may be thinking the same thing. Go ask your parents or your grandparents. Ask them if their jaws dropped when they read in their city newspaper that Mercedes McCambridge, Harold Hughes, Dana Andrews or Jan Clayton overcame great public shame and selflessly declared to the world their status as a person in recovery from alcoholism.This should have been the turning point in public opinion, but strong political and cultural forces of the impending ""War on Drugs"" squashed much of the forward momentum of this historic advocacy moment. It's now 40 years later and not enough has changed when it comes to stigma and shame. What has changed, however, is that now addiction is the leading cause of accidental death in America. The problem has grown exponentially urgent with only incremental policy and cultural progress to point towards in recent decades.When it comes to stigma, we may be more comfortable talking about addiction and recovery among our friends and colleagues, but where it counts -- in employment settings, access to health benefits, housing applications, and in the criminal justice system -- much remains the same. I lost count of the number of people who sat in a movie theaters in 2013 and 2014 and, after watching The Anonymous People, talked about how they still felt discriminated against in their day-to-day lives.In 1976, Ms. Marty Mann, founder of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence, and the others who came together that day envisioned a future where addiction was seen as a public health issue. Forty years have passed and the need to shift public opinion and policy persists.The UNITE to Face Addiction Rally on the National Mall last October was the second time in 40 years that a list this long of major celebrities and influencers came together to challenge perceptions around addiction and recovery. Tens of thousands cheered and wept as Joe Walsh, Steven Tyler, Sheryl Crow, Darryl Strawberry, Paul McCartney, Ringo Starr, Dr. Mehmet Oz, Allison Janney, and so many more stood up on behalf of the 22 million people still suffering, the millions we have lost, and the 23 million living in recovery.The Surgeon General of the United States, Dr. Vivek Murthy, made the most important statement of all when he stood before the crowd of the afflicted and affected and declared that he was with them as America's top doctor. He proclaimed addiction as a public health crisis and not a moral failing. The loudest crowd roar of the day came, not from the celebration of a classic rock song, but when Dr. Murthy told the crowd he would release the first ever Surgeon General's report on substance use, addiction, and health later this year.Let's hope that this time we truly ended the silence around addiction. We must sustain this momentum. We can't afford to wait another 40 years.  "

After 25 years of teaching, that line is still is one of my favorites along with ""UFOs are possible"" (which is true, they are unidentified) and ""Mr. Walsh, you don't really read these journal entries, do you?"" (to which I added, ""No"").But on Mother's Day, I'll borrow a bit from my student's paper and tweak it a bit... If it weren't for the mothers in my life, I wouldn't be the person I am today.When my wife laughs that I'm often more of a feminist than she is -- I observe it's not from any noble ideal; it was simply self-preservation -- growing up with my dad traveling three days a week leaving me at home with my mom, my three sisters, my grandmother from Florida three months a year, Daisy our beagle and Duke -- our cat who was ""fixed,"" -- implying that his default male state was broken, I suppose.1:3 - even in shuffleboardIt has been amazing to see each of my sisters become wonderful mothers--each bringing their own humor, patience, skills and love to their children mirroring our wonderful mom, Ann, but also our grandmothers Laura and Melanie. I've been fortunate beyond my wildest dreams to marry a lovely woman who not only melded beautifully into my sisters' lives but also became a great friend to my mother. And moving down another generation, I can see the same type of warm, unconditional love in my daughter that makes her such a special person--destined to carry on the mothering techniques she's observed so well.So, at the risk of sounding like Patrice's father Bob when he retired from Ford and dangerously found himself suggesting improved vacuuming techniques to Helen, I'm going to suggest a short recipe for a pretty amazing mother--based on the fantastic moms that surround me.Laura with her three sons, Bob, Jerry and Jim.Consistency: My dad's mom, Laura, provided for all of us the importance of a routine despite many tragic losses in her life. For us it began with her morning tea, and took her through the day that included watering the flowers, ironing, The Price is Right and her afternoon Novena with Bingo three nights a week. She found no greater joy than a good game of cards and her family around her. MelanieFlexibility:  My mom's mom Melanie worked countless jobs while raising six kids pretty singlehandedly, was a published poet and in her 50's took up tennis and eventually won a national title. She never tired and couldn't wait to share in your life -- even asking me about my college roommates -- 15 years after I'd graduated. She was the ultimate survivor and transforming herself from the privileged daughter of a wealthy family that lost it all in the Depression to the person she became has always been an inspiration. Ann's World Series champion SealsCourage:  My mom, Ann, not only had no problem deciding to start her own ""young fives"" program, pulling me out of kindergarten and waiting a year, but she also was a leader in La Leche League, championing breastfeeding support -- which my wife Patrice also did while raising our own kids. My mom also decided to coach a little league girls hardball team when no one else would step forward. I cannot count the number of times in my life someone has told me, ""Talking to your mother, wow, it changed my life!"" Katie's clan: Anthony, Benjy, Elizabeth and JJUnflappability:  My sister Katie is an amazing mom who has been a magazine's managing editor in New York for 25+ years while raising three wonderful kids. Katie's steady patience and sly humor is something I've witnessed and enjoyed since our days on the paper route. She continually supports her three kids and is a terrific aunt to our own. She is a natural champion of causes and a calm leader amidst deadlines and the biggest Manhattan traffic jams! Danny, Colleen and Paul Clear Communication:  My sister Colleen was born with laughing eyes and love of all company. She's an amazing mom to Danny and has given him the unconditional love that we received from our mom. I'm in constant admiration of her work with Chicago students, her two masters' degrees, her fluent Spanish, her many stints abroad as an exchange student and international traveler -- she's a born bridge-builder and works tirelessly to help us all get along better and know each other a little more. Maureen with Nate, Andrew and Mike  Unwavering Support:  Maureen, my youngest sister, is the mother of two boys -- with a capital B. Maureen's talents took her on a different high school track from her older sisters -- she was a terrific cheerleader is an amazing singer. Her sons Nate and Andrew love all sports and Maureen not only is at every one of their events but also was a volunteer and substitute teacher in their school for years. Maureen's friends are fiercely loyal and reflect her love for them. Helen and her five daughters.The Long-View: My mother-in-law Helen, is a model of keeping your eye on the horizon -- understanding the need to have something to look forward to. At 86, she's prepping for a cruise with her many daughters and daughters-in-law in three weeks. No matter what hardships she and those around her endure, Helen's steadfast reliability and optimism is infectious and steadying for us all. Patrice and Angela's 10+ year girl scout troop at 2015 prom.Endless Inclusion: Patrice's love of laughter and acceptance is a direct sequel to her mother's. It's a joy for me to see our college-age kids sharing their days with her. Even when they choose to discuss matters at the dangerously late hour of anytime after 11 pm, they can be certain that above all they are loved -- and will probably be teased. And to see her troop of girl scouts surround her before last year's prom was just a small testament to her reach.I can easily include in this network of amazing moms my aunts, sisters-in-law, cousins and the incredible teachers in my life who have been in front of me at the chalkboard or beside me in the teacher's lounge. All of whom inspire me and shape me as a father and friend.And it's easy to look at the recipe above and say it applies to fathers too--but this feminist dad would suggest is that perhaps the best compliment a father might receive is that he's actually behaving more like a mother."

Danny, Colleen and Paul Clear Communication:  My sister Colleen was born with laughing eyes and love of all company. She's an amazing mom to Danny and has given him the unconditional love that we received from our mom. I'm in constant admiration of her work with Chicago students, her two masters' degrees, her fluent Spanish, her many stints abroad as an exchange student and international traveler -- she's a born bridge-builder and works tirelessly to help us all get along better and know each other a little more. Maureen with Nate, Andrew and Mike  Unwavering Support:  Maureen, my youngest sister, is the mother of two boys -- with a capital B. Maureen's talents took her on a different high school track from her older sisters -- she was a terrific cheerleader is an amazing singer. Her sons Nate and Andrew love all sports and Maureen not only is at every one of their events but also was a volunteer and substitute teacher in their school for years. Maureen's friends are fiercely loyal and reflect her love for them. Helen and her five daughters.The Long-View: My mother-in-law Helen, is a model of keeping your eye on the horizon -- understanding the need to have something to look forward to. At 86, she's prepping for a cruise with her many daughters and daughters-in-law in three weeks. No matter what hardships she and those around her endure, Helen's steadfast reliability and optimism is infectious and steadying for us all. Patrice and Angela's 10+ year girl scout troop at 2015 prom.Endless Inclusion: Patrice's love of laughter and acceptance is a direct sequel to her mother's. It's a joy for me to see our college-age kids sharing their days with her. Even when they choose to discuss matters at the dangerously late hour of anytime after 11 pm, they can be certain that above all they are loved -- and will probably be teased. And to see her troop of girl scouts surround her before last year's prom was just a small testament to her reach.I can easily include in this network of amazing moms my aunts, sisters-in-law, cousins and the incredible teachers in my life who have been in front of me at the chalkboard or beside me in the teacher's lounge. All of whom inspire me and shape me as a father and friend.And it's easy to look at the recipe above and say it applies to fathers too--but this feminist dad would suggest is that perhaps the best compliment a father might receive is that he's actually behaving more like a mother."

That's the solicitor general.A group of men who previously held the position, with service experience under every president since George H.W. Bush, sent a letter earlier this week to the Senate heaping praise on Judge Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama's choice to sit on the high court.""Judge Garland has demonstrated the temperament, intellect, and experience to serve in this capacity"" and ""has a history of excellence in the law,"" read the May 2 letter addressed to Senate leadership, including Sens. Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Chuck Grassley (Iowa), the top two Republicans with direct control over ensuring Garland gets a hearing and a vote.These lawyers should know. The Office of the Solicitor General is a workhorse in our constitutional system, serving dual roles as an officer before the Supreme Court and as a representative of the federal government. In April alone, the office took part in all 10 cases the Supreme Court heard during its final sitting of the current term, which ended last week.Collectively, the signatories to the letter, made public Thursday, have argued hundreds of cases before the Supreme Court and represent a virtual who's who among advocates who regularly appear before the justices.One of them, Theodore Olson, was named solicitor general shortly after winning Bush v. Gore, the Supreme Court case that effectively handed the 2000 presidential election to George W. Bush. Olson's successor, Paul Clement, was a law clerk to Justice Antonin Scalia, and over the years defended conservative positions before the Supreme Court on gun rights, same-sex marriage and the Affordable Care Act, among dozens of other disputes.That these lawyers agreed that Obama's pick is ""superbly qualified"" to serve on the high court -- despite working for administrations with widely divergent views on the Constitution and the rule of law -- is a feat in itself.""We are confident that Judge Garland would bring his brilliance, work ethic, and broad experience to the cases that come before him,"" the letter read.Doom-and-gloom ads from conservative groups, fearful that Scalia's replacement will tilt the Supreme Court liberal for the first time in decades, have sought to paint a different picture: Garland as something of a liberal extremist in areas such as the Second Amendment and labor issues.But if that were true, the bipartisan letter by these former government lawyers, many of whom are now in private practice at prominent law firms, would go against the very things they've stood for in court.Clement, for example, counts as clients a number of business interests with pending cases before the Supreme Court. As recently as this Monday, the justices turned away one of his cases, a high-stakes constitutional challenge to Seattle's minimum wage law -- presumably because such a case needs a full nine-member court for proper resolution. If Garland is as anti-business as his worst critics claim, then he might have not been much help in such a case.Crucially, the letter doesn't take the extra step of urging McConnell and Grassley to schedule a hearing for Garland, who has been waiting more than 50 days since Obama nominated him. As of Thursday, the Senate Judiciary Committee chair was standing firm by his position of no hearing and no votes for Garland until after the election.""Senator Grassley has made it clear that he wants the American people to have a voice in the role of the Supreme Court in our constitutional system of government,"" read a statement by Grassley's office issued Thursday, according to The Wall Street Journal.Maybe Senate Republicans, in the same spirit of bipartisanship, should accept the solicitors general's letter for what it is: a good-faith expression that Garland truly is the kind of across-the-aisle jurist for such a time as now -- and quite likely a better choice than anyone they might get under a President Donald Trump."

Circuit.“Judge Garland is, without doubt, highly qualified to serve as a justice of the Supreme Court,” the Legal Defense Fund's report states. “He maintains a steadfast respect for the doctrinal and technical contours of the law, forges narrow, carefully reasoned opinions, and builds consensus.”The Lawyers' Committee believes Garland to be ""exceptionally highly qualified."" Along with its report, the group addressed a statement, signed by the 150 members of its board of directors, to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) urging the Senate to ""fulfill its constitutional role and grant Judge Garland fair consideration and a full Senate floor vote."" On the topic of employment discrimination, the Lawyers' Committee noted that Garland does not “evidence an ideology tending to favor either employees or employers,” but that he allows the plaintiffs to be heard on their merits.The Legal Defense Fund pointed to the 1999 case of Anderson v. Zubieta, in which Garland ruled against an employer accused of wage discrimination against U.S. citizens of ""Panamanian and Hispanic descent.""Though Garland has had few opportunities to rule on matters of housing discrimination, his record shows that he has supported tenants facing what is called ""source of income"" discrimination. In the 2008 case of Feemster v. BSA Limited Partnership -- a case highlighted by both groups -- the judge ruled that a landlord violated D.C. and federal housing laws in refusing to accept Section 8 vouchers as a form of payment.“Section 8 tenants’ right to stay in their homes and pay with vouchers was secure unless and until their tenancies were validly terminated under local law,” Garland wrote in that ruling.The two civil rights groups expressed some concern about the influence that Garland’s history as a prosecutor and Justice Department official may have on his decision making.According to the Legal Defense Fund, that ""professional experience and perspective as a longtime former federal prosecutor are apparent” in how he approaches criminal cases. The Lawyers' Committee noted that he “very rarely votes to reverse criminal convictions"" and that in his ""many opinions affirming criminal convictions and sentencing, Judge Garland frequently emphasizes the strength of the prosecution case against the defendant in finding alleged errors to be harmless.”Among other criminal justice issues, Garland has repeatedly sided with the government when it is accused of overstepping the limits of the Fourth Amendment, which protects citizens against unreasonable searches.In the 2002 case of United States v. Bookhardt -- mentioned by the Legal Defense Fund -- he upheld the constitutionality of a defendant’s arrest, while agreeing that the defendant was arrested without probable cause, which is a constitutional requirement. He reasoned that the arrest was justified on other grounds.Despite these issues, both civil rights groups called for an ""immediate"" and ""prompt"" hearing on Garland's nomination in the Senate. But so far that lawmaking body remains determined to wait for the next president to weigh in."
9,POLITICS,President Obama Says Flint's Glass Is Half Full,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-flint-water_us_572cfbb7e4b0bc9cb046db16,"Yes, the water crisis was bad -- but things are getting better.",2016-05-07,"President Barack Obama drinks water as he finishes a speech on May 4, 2016, at Flint Northwestern High School about the ongoing water crisis in Flint, Michigan.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For the past two years people in Flint, Michigan, have been given poisoned water that exposed an entire generation of kids to lead, a deadly toxin that can permanently damage developing brains.This week President Barack Obama traveled there to tell them they'll be okay. Kinda.""If you know that your child may have been exposed and you go to a health clinic, a doctor, a provider, and are working with them, then your child will be fine,"" Obama said. And he drank a glass of filtered Flint water. At the same time, just by being there, the president signaled that Flint remains an important story -- that the poisoning of an entire city's water supply with a deadly neurotoxin still matters. ""The president's visit comes at a really crucial time, at least for the people from Flint -- I can speak for myself in this regard -- it was beginning to feel like the urgency was fading,"" Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), who represents the area around Flint, told ""So That Happened,"" the HuffPost Politics podcast. ""Many of us who have been involved in trying to fight for Flint even long before it became a national story have had a concern that Flint would sort of get its 15 minutes of fame, there'd be a lot of attention around this lead crisis, and then some other event would overtake things and Flint would become sort of an asterisk in history,"" Kildee said. Lead contaminated Flint's water after the city switched from Detroit to the Flint River as its water source in April 2014. State officials told the city not to treat the water with chemicals that reduce lead leaching from the city's pipes, resulting in higher blood lead levels in Flint children. Obama noted that Flint is not the only city that's had lead problems. Millions of American homes contain lead paint, and millions are connected to water mains via lead pipes. ""What happened here is just an extreme example, an extreme and tragic case of what’s happening in a lot of places around the country,"" Obama said. ""We’ve seen unacceptably high levels of lead in townships along the Jersey Shore and in North Carolina’s major cities. We’ve seen it in the capitals of South Carolina and Mississippi. And even, not long ago, lead-contaminated drinking water was found right down the street from the United States Capitol.""Flint's crisis came to a head last fall after research showed the city's leaded water contributed to an increase in elevated blood levels, in Flint kids who'd been tested, from 2.4 percent to 4.9 percent. To reinforce the message that Flint's kids would be all right, Obama pointed to himself.""If you are my age, or older, or maybe even a little bit younger, you got some lead in your system when you were growing up,"" Obama said. ""I am sure that somewhere, when I was two years old, I was taking a chip of paint, tasting it, and I got some lead. Or sometimes toys were painted with lead, and you were chewing on them.""As public health experts have learned more about the dangers of lead, thresholds for what is considered a ""safe"" level of exposure have fallen steadily in the past several decades. The government banned lead from gasoline and paint, and it developed rules for limiting people's exposure through water tainted by lead pipes. Rates of lead exposure in children, the population most vulnerable to its effects, have fallen. Bruce Lanphear, an expert on childhood exposure to neurotoxins at Simon Fraser University in Canada, said government officials need to strike a tricky balance with a situation like Flint's. ""We want to protect people, we want people to feel protected,"" Lanphear said. ""The way Obama dealt with it on one level makes sense, on another level dismisses a really important problem."" As public health experts have developed a better understanding of lead, its potential to cause harm at even low doses has become apparent.Research by Lanphear and others has shown that a person's first increment of lead exposure can cost exponentially more IQ points than subsequent increments. That doesn't mean a child exposed to lead will necessarily suffer from ADHD or other cognitive and behavioral problems associated with lead exposure, just that there's a higher risk. ""When we talk about something like lead we don't want to label these kids in Flint, or in the other cities where blood lead levels are higher, as damaged,"" Lanphear said. ""The goal of trying to point out there are problems at the low levels is to create enough of a sense of urgency that we do something about it."""

She got into Harvard and all that because she said she was a minority.""Warren noticed Trump's Friday night volley, and held no punches in her reply.Warren even co-opted Trump’s signature -- ""Sad!"" -- but refashioned if for her own feelings about the real estate mogul.The Friday night spat comes just days after Warren slammed Trump following his win in the Indiana primary. “Trump has built his campaign on racism, sexism and xenophobia,” she wrote on Facebook, calling on voters from all parties to unite against Trump:What happens next will test the character for all of us — Republican, Democrat and Independent. It will determine whether we move forward as one nation or splinter at the hands of one man’s narcissism and divisiveness. I know which side I’m on, and I’m going to fight my heart out to make sure Donald Trump’s toxic stew of hatred and insecurity never reaches the White House.UPDATE: 10:30 p.m. -- Trump called Warren a ""goofus"" at a rally in Eugene, Oregon.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misstated the year that Scott Brown attacked Warren for her ancestry. It was 2012, not 2002."
16,QUEER VOICES,These Beautiful Photographs Explore The Wide Spectrum Of Gender Identity,James Michael Nichols,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/spectrum-of-gender-identity_us_57278077e4b0b49df6abd4c5,"""As soon as we learn to understand, we can overcome the fear of the strange.""",2016-05-07,"Levi, 22, New York City, private gardener and classical life model",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572921c11300002900380682.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Our culture's understanding of -- or at least willingness to acknowledge -- how diverse the range of human gender identities can be has evolved in recent years, thanks in part to an increase of visibility of these identities in popular culture. As a result, more and more people are living as their authentic selves and gender is being conceived of as a spectrum of identities, not a simple binary consisting of only ""male"" and ""female.""Gender as a Spectrum, a new book from photographer Joseph Wolfgang Ohlert with text by Kaey, showcases a range of identities and experiences that fall across that wide spectrum of gender identities. Each portrait shot by Ohlert is accompanied by an interview with Kaey.""I personally think the human mind needs categories to just simply function. The question is who defines these categories and what power does these definitions [hold]?"" Kaey told The Huffington Post. ""Is it just a definition without any judgement or is it a definition to separate the good from the bad? We still live in a patriarchy where masculinity is something good and femininity [seen as] the weak point. This means to examine. gender is a step into the direction of real equality.""In the interview below, Kaey discusses Gender as a Spectrum, the people featured in the project and the book's message.The Huffington Post: What inspired the book? What are you trying to accomplish?Kaey: The idea was to make a portrait book with people who don't define themselves in the binary [system of] gender. Joseph is a brilliant photographer when it comes to capturing the personality of a person. His portraits are very vulnerable and strong at the same time. Another important thing for the book was to let the people speak for themselves. Specially with such a complicated matter as self-definition and gender, it's important to let the people use their own words to describe themselves. The media still doesn't give much space for trans and non-binary people to use their own language.How did you find the subjects for the book?Many of the people in the book are friends of mine I've know throughout the years. Especially in Berlin, there is something of a scene for queer people -- and I am not talking about gays and lesbians. My idea was to do [the project] with only with trans*people but Joseph said we should not limit the idea and have a spectrum of people in the book.So now it's as colorful as the rainbow, which sounds very cliché but it's true and a great thing. After asking a few friends of mine to join in, Joseph also started looking online for interesting characters. We are both artists living in one of the most exciting cities of the world -- our network is pretty big and so we've met a lot of people.Do you feel like our culture is finally beginning to understand just how complex and important gender is?Gender or the idea of what gender is was always an important part in many cultures way before today. In other non-Western cultures, different gender concepts already existed. I think what the difference is nowadays is the media. The pool of information is so enormously big that it can be confusing sometimes.We still live in a patriarchy where masculinity is something good and femininity [seen as] the weak point. This means to examine gender is a step into the direction of real equality. As soon as we learn to understand, we can overcome the fear of the strange.Do you feel like in the future people will conceptualize gender in the same way that we do today?There still is a long way to go, as you can see especially in states with the [anti-queer] bathroom bills. That's a disaster! I think there will always be more conservative people who try to repress new ideas and concepts, but nowadays the people have more power themselves. If you want, you can have a voice -- even if it's just through social media. In the end you will find out that you are not alone and there are always people who try to listen and understand.I think concepts of what gender and sexuality mean are changing a lot. I see much more younger people come out as trans -- the possibility to transition and the openness that young people have to express themselves has changed very much in the last two decades and I think that will go on. But, to be honest, I think we are not getting rid of the boxes, like male or female. I think we will have many more boxes and we learn that it's totally ok to be fluid and change throughout your life. Maybe one day gender will be like a hair color; maybe a perm is a bit complicated and it could hurt and burn on your head. But if you like to try and are not afraid of the risk, why not simply try another color every month?What message do hope people to take away from this project?We want to show that there are already many more boxes you can choose from and feel comfortable with [than just ""male"" or ""female""]. But, in the end, I think it's important to show that we are all people. We all have feelings! We all have our package that we have to carry. And we all have our dark moments. So why not put some glitter over it and sparkle?Check out more photos from Gender As A Spectrum below and head here for more information about the book."

And your plan better include voting.""",2016-05-07,President Barack Obama urged graduates to continue the work of improving the lives of African Americans during his commencement address at Howard University on Saturday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572e32131300002900380e25.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Barack Obama urged Howard University’s class of 2016 on Saturday to ""be confident in [their] blackness"" and continue past generations' work to improve the lives of African Americans in the U.S.After opening his address on the progress African Americans have made, Obama spent a good portion of his speech discussing the importance of being black and the challenges facing graduates of Howard, one the country's historically black universities.Obama, who wrote about being black while raised by a white mother and grandparents, told the graduates the notion of what it meant to be black in America had changed since he graduated college.""Be confident in your heritage, be confident in your blackness,"" the president said. ""One of the great changes that's occurred in the country since I was your age is the realization there's no one way to be black, take it from someone who's seen both sides of the debate about whether I'm black or not.""""The past couple of months I've had lunch with the Queen of England and hosted Kendrick Lamar in the Oval Office,"" he continued. ""There's no straightjacket, there's no constraint, there's no litmus test for authenticity.""But being black also comes with a responsibility to address injustice in the world, Obama said.""Even as we each embrace our own beautiful and unique and valid versions of our blackness, remember the tie that does bind us as African Americans and that is our particular awareness of injustice and unfairness and struggle,"" Obama told the students. ""That means we cannot sleepwalk through life. We cannot be ignorant of history. We can't meet the world with a sense of entitlement.""That's a pet peeve of mine, people who've been successful and don't realize they've been lucky, that God may have blessed them,"" he added. ""It wasn't nothing you did, so don't have an attitude.""The president noted that the unemployment rate remains higher among African Americans than their white counterparts and there was still a racial achievement gap in schools. The Treasury Department has announced that Harriet Tubman would appear on the $20 bill, but Obama noted that black women continue to be paid significantly less than white men.""Harriet Tubman may be going on the 20, but we've still got a gender gap when a black woman working full time still earns just 66 percent of what a white man gets paid,"" he said.Obama called on activists to vote in order to fix these problems. He noted there were still too many barriers to voting and said there was a ""legacy"" of blocking people from voting and a reason why some officials had an interest in blocking voters from the ballot box. But the president also expressed frustration that voter turnout in the 2014 midterm elections was so low.""Passion is vital but you have to have a strategy,"" he said. ""And your plan better include voting. Not just some of the time, but all of the time.""Obama implored graduates to vote not just for their president, but in their local elections as well. He framed the importance of voting through the legacy of previous generations of African Americans, who were subject to poll taxes and literacy tests in order to vote.""You don't have to risk your life to cast a ballot, other people already did that for you,"" the president said.Beyond voting, Obama said activists had to be willing to compromise if they wanted to achieve change, echoing comments he made last month while traveling in London.""Change requires more than just speaking out, it requires listening as well. In particular it requires listening to those with whom you disagree and being prepared to compromise,"" he said. """"Even when you are 100 percent right, this is hard to explain sometimes, you can be completely right and you are still going to engage folks who disagree with you.""Obama, who often speaks about how change is slow and incremental, also said that refusing to compromise with those who disagree would lead activists to feel good about themselves, but not change.The president told the students that listening also means that activists shouldn't interrupt politicians' rallies -- a tactic the Black Lives Matter movement frequently uses -- and that controversial speakers shouldn't be disinvited from speaking on college campuses.""As my grandmother used to tell me, every time a fool speaks, they are just advertising their own ignorance,"" he said."

Two of them work for Qatar-based broadcaster Al Jazeera. They can appeal.The sentence is the latest since a crackdown on the Muslim Brotherhood after an army takeover stripped Mursi of power in 2013 following mass protests against his rule. Mursi and other Brotherhood leaders, as well as leading figures from the 2011 popular uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak, many of them secular activists and journalists, are now in jail.Mursi has been sentenced in three other cases, including the death penalty for a mass jail break during the 2011 uprising and a life sentence for spying on behalf of Hamas.Qatar had supported Mursi, who is in jail along with thousands of Brotherhood members, many of whom have been sentenced to death on separate charges.Relations between Qatar, a Gulf Arab state, and Egypt have been icy since July 2013 when Egypt's then-army chief Abdel Fattah al-Sisi overthrew Mursi.Sisi says the Brotherhood poses a serious threat to security despite the crackdown, which has weakened what was once Egypt's most organized political group."

Lesvos is the fourth stop in our series Route Mediterranean.LESVOS, GREECE – “I’m fine. My situation is not,” Tasif is a lanky 20-year-old from Pakistan with a generous mop of black hair, a strong nose, and a somber demeanor.Tasif is a lanky 20-year-old from Pakistan with a generous mop of black hair, a strong nose and a missing front tooth that he might have lost during his journey. When I met him, he was living in an unofficial camp organized by a volunteer group called the Open Borders Kitchen.At the beginning of March, he crossed the Aegean Sea in an overcrowded rubber dinghy arranged by smugglers on the Turkish coast with the dream of reaching Western Europe. But his hopes of continuing on were dashed on March 8 when Macedonian authorities closed their border with Greece to refugees and migrants. More than 50,000 people were stranded in the Hellenic Republic due to the closure.After a long and expensive journey, during which he was kidnapped, beaten and held for ransom, Tasif is now stuck. Along with thousands of others, he faces detention and deportation under a recent agreement between the EU and Turkey aimed at stemming the flow of people across the Aegean into Europe. Tasif was right. His situation was not good.Earlier in the day, two ferries chugged out to sea from the port of Mytilene, the island’s capital, clearly visible from where Tasif was standing. They carried the first 136 people, almost exclusively South Asians, to be deported from Greece back to Turkey.Under the E.U.-Turkey agreement, people stranded in Greece have the right to apply for asylum. But even if they qualify, their claims can be rejected and they can still be deported under the premise that Turkey provides protection for asylum seekers that is equivalent to what they would receive in Europe.Human rights organizations have heavily criticized the agreement and the claim that Turkey is a “safe country” for refugees. Several days before the deal went into effect, Amnesty International released a report documenting the forced return from Turkey of around 100 Syrians per day since mid-January. At the end of March, Amnesty also documented the forced return of around 30 asylum seekers to Afghanistan.The agreement has also solidified a kind of hierarchy among asylum seekers. Syrians are widely viewed as legitimate refugees, as a guard outside of the Moria detention center, based five miles north of Mytilene, said to me. Others, particularly those from South Asia and North Africa, are seen as economic migrants piggybacking on the legitimate flight of Syrians. “There is no war in Pakistan,” as the guard said.This perception heavily influences the approval process of asylum claims. “Where you’re from depends a great deal on the success of the claim,” said Daniel Szabo, a communication officer with the International Organization for Migration (IOM). But people from countries other than Syria are not just making their way to Europe for economic reasons, according to Szabo. “Some of these people are in very vulnerable situations, but don’t fall into that refugee category,” he said. The fate of these people – people like Tasif – under the E.U.-Turkey agreement is entirely unclear.“I’m not coming here for money. I’m coming here to save my life,” Tasif said as people milled around the Open Borders Kitchen camp and the fading daylight cast long shadows of small tents camped across the ground. Like most of the Pakistanis in the camp, Tasif is from the Punjab region of Pakistan.An ongoing series of border skirmishes with India that began in 2014 left dozens dead in the area, while flooding of the Chenab River killed hundreds and displaced over 100,000 in the past two years. To add to the climactic displacement, terrorist attacks in Pakistan have caused more than 300 civilian deaths since January 2015. The combined effect of these events led Tasif to seek a safer and more secure life in Europe. But the clandestine journey to get here was far from straightforward.Along the way, Tasif put himself at the mercy of smugglers. After traveling from the Pakistani port of Karachi to Iran, his handlers put him on a bus. “There was no food. No water,” Tasif said. But it turned out that hunger and thirst were the least of his woes.Tasif was kidnapped by the very people who were helping him flee.“They said give us $2,000, and we will release you,” Tasif told me. The men beat him on the head and back with sticks and forced him to call his family for ransom money, but Tasif’s family couldn’t pay. Finally, two men in the group were able to come up with the ransom, a total of $4,000 dollars. Tasif and the others were allowed to continue their journey. The difficulties, however, didn’t end there.Crossing the border from Iran into Turkey took 12 hours of walking across challenging terrain. During the trek, security forces opened fire on the group. Having narrowly escaped the gunshots, Tasif took a bus to Istanbul and then on to Izmir, Turkey’s third largest city and main portal for human smuggling. After spending less than seven days in Turkey, he boarded a rubber dinghy with 77 people and headed out to sea. “It’s capacity was written clearly, ‘For 18 people only,’” Tasif said incredulously.“After I reached here the Greek Navy said: ‘Welcome to Europe.’ But, where is [the] welcome to Europe?” Tasif asked, sweeping his hand across the crowded, makeshift camp on the beach.The trip took Tasif a month and cost him a little bit over $5,000. “I sold my home in Pakistan to get here,” Tasif, the eldest of six siblings, told me. “If I go back, I won’t have money and I won’t have a home.”The evening I spoke with Tasif, there was a sense that the organization that held the Open Borders Kitchen camp together over several months of refugee arrivals was starting to fray. The dumpsters were overflowing. People were moving around with a frenetic energy. The packing pallets stacked at the entrance indicated that the place was being slowly dismantled.Earlier in the day, the police came and informed the roughly 500 residents, mostly from South Asia and North Africa, that they would be evicted in two days. Everyone would be taken to Moria, an official refugee camp and registration point that has been turned into a detention center under the E.U.-Turkey agreement. From there, the expectation was that it would only be a matter of time before the people living in the Open Borders Kitchen camp were deported.“Not safe Moria. Not safe Turkey. Not safe Pakistan,” Tasif said when I asked him about the future. “Many people say they will commit suicide if they go to Turkey. I will not go. Turkey is not safe for me. We wish to go to another country in Europe.”The talk of suicide was not just hyperbole. There have been at least three attempts inside Moria, a former prison that is over capacity by about 1,000 people and surrounded with high fences topped with spools of razor wire, according to media reports and the United Nations’ refugee agency UNHCR. Frustrations in the camp, without enough tents to house everyone and lack of adequate sanitation given the overcrowding, recently boiled over into riots.Tasif’s agitation is shared by others awaiting eviction. “We’re waiting here for the people to come and take us to Turkey,” Nabil, a dejected looking Algerian sitting with two friends at the entrance of the Open Borders Kitchen camp, told me. “If there was anything in Algeria, I would have stayed there. There’s nothing there.” The official unemployment rate for youth in Algeria is almost 30 percent.Rumors were flying in the camp, and accurate information was difficult to come by. Nobody actually knew what was going to happen or when. “Do you know when the police will come?” Nabil asked, a flicker of hope flashing across his face.The Open Borders Kitchen did not close immediately. But, on April 21, Greek police came early in the morning and placed the remaining residents of the camp on buses bound for Moria. The informal venue that had fed tens of thousands transiting through the island was closed.People in Moria, and elsewhere in Greece, have now entered an indeterminate period of waiting. After 346 people were deported during the first week of April, returns to Turkey have slowed to a trickle because of heavy criticism from human rights organizations. “The first round of European Union-sanctioned deportations … was rushed, chaotic and violated the rights of those deported,” Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a press statement.Logistical challenges have also impeded the returns. There are a large number of people applying for asylum in Greece. The E.U. promised to send experts to help process the claims, but most of the support has yet to arrive.There are further concerns about non-Syrians deported to Turkey under the agreement. Syrians are automatically granted “Temporary Protection” status, but the fate of individuals from other nationalities is unclear. Turkey does not have a status that gives legal rights or protection to vulnerable people who are not considered refugees, according to Wenzel Michalski, HRW’s director for Germany.Instead of allowing people to stay in the country, Turkey is seeking to send them back to their countries of origin as quickly as possible. On April 15, Turkey signed a readmission agreement with Pakistan to help expedite this process and is negotiating readmission agreements with a number of other countries.Adding to the uncertainty for those facing deportation, nothing is known about the treatment or conditions of the people who have already been sent back to Turkey. “All these people disappeared inside a detention center in Turkey,” Michalski said over the phone. International and human rights organizations have been denied access to the facility where they are being held. “They’re behind walls and fences and nobody has seen them,” he said.Barring any changes in the implementation of the E.U.-Turkey agreement, for Tasif – and other people facing likely deportation from Greece – this is the future that awaits.Route Mediterranean is our series focusing on one of several refugee routes that form the Mediterranean crossings.This series has been produced with support from Medium magazine.This article originally appeared on Refugees Deeply.

Lesvos is the fourth stop in our series Route Mediterranean.LESVOS, GREECE – “I’m fine. My situation is not,” Tasif is a lanky 20-year-old from Pakistan with a generous mop of black hair, a strong nose, and a somber demeanor.Tasif is a lanky 20-year-old from Pakistan with a generous mop of black hair, a strong nose and a missing front tooth that he might have lost during his journey. When I met him, he was living in an unofficial camp organized by a volunteer group called the Open Borders Kitchen.At the beginning of March, he crossed the Aegean Sea in an overcrowded rubber dinghy arranged by smugglers on the Turkish coast with the dream of reaching Western Europe. But his hopes of continuing on were dashed on March 8 when Macedonian authorities closed their border with Greece to refugees and migrants. More than 50,000 people were stranded in the Hellenic Republic due to the closure.After a long and expensive journey, during which he was kidnapped, beaten and held for ransom, Tasif is now stuck. Along with thousands of others, he faces detention and deportation under a recent agreement between the EU and Turkey aimed at stemming the flow of people across the Aegean into Europe. Tasif was right. His situation was not good.Earlier in the day, two ferries chugged out to sea from the port of Mytilene, the island’s capital, clearly visible from where Tasif was standing. They carried the first 136 people, almost exclusively South Asians, to be deported from Greece back to Turkey.Under the E.U.-Turkey agreement, people stranded in Greece have the right to apply for asylum. But even if they qualify, their claims can be rejected and they can still be deported under the premise that Turkey provides protection for asylum seekers that is equivalent to what they would receive in Europe.Human rights organizations have heavily criticized the agreement and the claim that Turkey is a “safe country” for refugees. Several days before the deal went into effect, Amnesty International released a report documenting the forced return from Turkey of around 100 Syrians per day since mid-January. At the end of March, Amnesty also documented the forced return of around 30 asylum seekers to Afghanistan.The agreement has also solidified a kind of hierarchy among asylum seekers. Syrians are widely viewed as legitimate refugees, as a guard outside of the Moria detention center, based five miles north of Mytilene, said to me. Others, particularly those from South Asia and North Africa, are seen as economic migrants piggybacking on the legitimate flight of Syrians. “There is no war in Pakistan,” as the guard said.This perception heavily influences the approval process of asylum claims. “Where you’re from depends a great deal on the success of the claim,” said Daniel Szabo, a communication officer with the International Organization for Migration (IOM). But people from countries other than Syria are not just making their way to Europe for economic reasons, according to Szabo. “Some of these people are in very vulnerable situations, but don’t fall into that refugee category,” he said. The fate of these people – people like Tasif – under the E.U.-Turkey agreement is entirely unclear.“I’m not coming here for money. I’m coming here to save my life,” Tasif said as people milled around the Open Borders Kitchen camp and the fading daylight cast long shadows of small tents camped across the ground. Like most of the Pakistanis in the camp, Tasif is from the Punjab region of Pakistan.An ongoing series of border skirmishes with India that began in 2014 left dozens dead in the area, while flooding of the Chenab River killed hundreds and displaced over 100,000 in the past two years. To add to the climactic displacement, terrorist attacks in Pakistan have caused more than 300 civilian deaths since January 2015. The combined effect of these events led Tasif to seek a safer and more secure life in Europe. But the clandestine journey to get here was far from straightforward.Along the way, Tasif put himself at the mercy of smugglers. After traveling from the Pakistani port of Karachi to Iran, his handlers put him on a bus. “There was no food. No water,” Tasif said. But it turned out that hunger and thirst were the least of his woes.Tasif was kidnapped by the very people who were helping him flee.“They said give us $2,000, and we will release you,” Tasif told me. The men beat him on the head and back with sticks and forced him to call his family for ransom money, but Tasif’s family couldn’t pay. Finally, two men in the group were able to come up with the ransom, a total of $4,000 dollars. Tasif and the others were allowed to continue their journey. The difficulties, however, didn’t end there.Crossing the border from Iran into Turkey took 12 hours of walking across challenging terrain. During the trek, security forces opened fire on the group. Having narrowly escaped the gunshots, Tasif took a bus to Istanbul and then on to Izmir, Turkey’s third largest city and main portal for human smuggling. After spending less than seven days in Turkey, he boarded a rubber dinghy with 77 people and headed out to sea. “It’s capacity was written clearly, ‘For 18 people only,’” Tasif said incredulously.“After I reached here the Greek Navy said: ‘Welcome to Europe.’ But, where is [the] welcome to Europe?” Tasif asked, sweeping his hand across the crowded, makeshift camp on the beach.The trip took Tasif a month and cost him a little bit over $5,000. “I sold my home in Pakistan to get here,” Tasif, the eldest of six siblings, told me. “If I go back, I won’t have money and I won’t have a home.”The evening I spoke with Tasif, there was a sense that the organization that held the Open Borders Kitchen camp together over several months of refugee arrivals was starting to fray. The dumpsters were overflowing. People were moving around with a frenetic energy. The packing pallets stacked at the entrance indicated that the place was being slowly dismantled.Earlier in the day, the police came and informed the roughly 500 residents, mostly from South Asia and North Africa, that they would be evicted in two days. Everyone would be taken to Moria, an official refugee camp and registration point that has been turned into a detention center under the E.U.-Turkey agreement. From there, the expectation was that it would only be a matter of time before the people living in the Open Borders Kitchen camp were deported.“Not safe Moria. Not safe Turkey. Not safe Pakistan,” Tasif said when I asked him about the future. “Many people say they will commit suicide if they go to Turkey. I will not go. Turkey is not safe for me. We wish to go to another country in Europe.”The talk of suicide was not just hyperbole. There have been at least three attempts inside Moria, a former prison that is over capacity by about 1,000 people and surrounded with high fences topped with spools of razor wire, according to media reports and the United Nations’ refugee agency UNHCR. Frustrations in the camp, without enough tents to house everyone and lack of adequate sanitation given the overcrowding, recently boiled over into riots.Tasif’s agitation is shared by others awaiting eviction. “We’re waiting here for the people to come and take us to Turkey,” Nabil, a dejected looking Algerian sitting with two friends at the entrance of the Open Borders Kitchen camp, told me. “If there was anything in Algeria, I would have stayed there. There’s nothing there.” The official unemployment rate for youth in Algeria is almost 30 percent.Rumors were flying in the camp, and accurate information was difficult to come by. Nobody actually knew what was going to happen or when. “Do you know when the police will come?” Nabil asked, a flicker of hope flashing across his face.The Open Borders Kitchen did not close immediately. But, on April 21, Greek police came early in the morning and placed the remaining residents of the camp on buses bound for Moria. The informal venue that had fed tens of thousands transiting through the island was closed.People in Moria, and elsewhere in Greece, have now entered an indeterminate period of waiting. After 346 people were deported during the first week of April, returns to Turkey have slowed to a trickle because of heavy criticism from human rights organizations. “The first round of European Union-sanctioned deportations … was rushed, chaotic and violated the rights of those deported,” Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a press statement.Logistical challenges have also impeded the returns. There are a large number of people applying for asylum in Greece. The E.U. promised to send experts to help process the claims, but most of the support has yet to arrive.There are further concerns about non-Syrians deported to Turkey under the agreement. Syrians are automatically granted “Temporary Protection” status, but the fate of individuals from other nationalities is unclear. Turkey does not have a status that gives legal rights or protection to vulnerable people who are not considered refugees, according to Wenzel Michalski, HRW’s director for Germany.Instead of allowing people to stay in the country, Turkey is seeking to send them back to their countries of origin as quickly as possible. On April 15, Turkey signed a readmission agreement with Pakistan to help expedite this process and is negotiating readmission agreements with a number of other countries.Adding to the uncertainty for those facing deportation, nothing is known about the treatment or conditions of the people who have already been sent back to Turkey. “All these people disappeared inside a detention center in Turkey,” Michalski said over the phone.

24,GOOD NEWS,Rescue Group Wants To Get Kittens Saved From Fire Off The Streets,Hilary Hanson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kittens-helmet-cam-footage-fire_us_572b979ae4b016f378951549,The kittens became Internet stars after a firefighter's helmet-cam footage went viral.,2016-05-07,Numerous news outlets ran footage shot from the point of view of a firefighter rescuing these kittens.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572b9b45160000e90031dd92.png?cache=TYuCCj0SGg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After firefighters rescued a group of kittens from a burning woodpile, another group of rescuers hopes to save them from the streets.Viral helmet camera footage of Turlock firefighter Dale Medlen rescuing four tiny kittens made numerous headlines this week. The fire department posted the dramatic video on Facebook Monday, after the Turlock Fire Department responded to a report of a burning woodpile that appeared to house the kittens.After cleaning and drying off the kittens, firefighters felt it best to leave them near the scene with their mother.""Turlock firefighters ensured that the mother made contact with the kittens so that she could nurse and care for them,"" the department told The Huffington Post in a statement. ""We are confident she took them to a safer location to be cared for. The kittens did not appear to be injured, only stunned by the incident.""The department added that emergency responders were “extremely confident with the well being and happiness of the purring kittens” and returned later to find that the cats seemed to have found a new place to live.It’s unclear if the cats were strays or ferals. Stray cats are homeless cats that are socialized to humans, while ferals are domestic cats that have reverted to a wild state, meaning they can almost never be kept as domestic pets. Feral kittens, however, can usually be socialized to people if they are younger than 12 weeks.But if the kittens' mother was feral, turning the animals in to the city shelter could have been a death sentence. The City of Turlock is legally not allowed to turn away any animal brought in. They work with local rescue groups to adopt out animals, but since truly feral cats are fearful and aggressive in cages, they often wind up euthanized.The trap-neuter-return program in surrounding Stanislaus County excludes the city of Turlock. But a local cat advocacy group is now trying to help the kittens that won so many hearts online, said Monica Barker of the Cat Network of Stanislaus, a feral cat nonprofit.“We will try to go out in this area … and see if we can find the little family and we will get them into a foster home,” Barker told HuffPost in an email. If it turns out that the mother is truly feral, she will be released, Barker added."

Vanishingly few, it turns out.Veteran NASA astronaut Tom Jones said he wondered about UFOs long before he joined the space agency.""I used to be a big UFO fan when I was a teenager, thinking that this was the next great frontier of exploration,"" Jones said in a recent interview with The Huffington Post. ""I dropped that opinion later on, after not seeing the evidence that I was looking for.""In his Smithsonian Air & Space Magazine column, ""Ask the Astronaut,"" Jones answered a recent question about whether he or other astronauts had ever seen UFOs from orbit. He wrote:Astronauts have not seen any evidence of alien life. Reports of unidentified flying objects in images returned from the shuttle or [space] station have turned out to be ice crystals, drifting orbital debris, lightning flashes, or meteors streaking through the dark atmosphere below. So far, our search for extraterrestrial life -- and other civilizations in space -- has turned up no proof of alien civilizations.Jones told HuffPost how, during his 1996 space shuttle mission, there were reports that his crew saw UFOs:I was on the shuttle Columbia -- STS-80 -- and even made a blog entry, 'Did UFOs Visit The Shuttle Columbia?' Because when we came back from that mission in 1996, NASA got several queries from people who were watching the video -- NASA TV back then -- and said, 'Hey, we saw spaceships on the shuttle video. What's NASA got to say about that?'Jones flew on four space shuttle missions over 11 years, culminating with STS-98, in February 2001, as seen in the below video. On that mission, he led three spacewalks to install the U.S. Destiny Laboratory -- the historic scientific centerpiece for the International Space Station.Jones said no contemporary astronaut has ever told him of seeing something unexplained or inexplicable. ""Certainly, nothing in the way of spaceships,"" he added.""Now, I'm aware that there have been a couple of astronauts in the past who've spoken out and said they know from other people that there's evidence of UFOs and spaceships that have visited the Earth and that the government might be withholding it.""They all seem to be secondhand, or they seem to be sightings of things that they've seen in orbit that, perhaps, they couldn't explain at the time. And that's where the story seems to peter out.""One of those mentioned by Jones was the late Gordon Cooper, an original Mercury astronaut -- one of the famous ""Right Stuff"" space voyagers. In 1975, Cooper told this writer how, in 1951 (before he became an astronaut), he and several other officers at an Air Force base in Germany witnessed groups of circular objects passing over the base.""A weatherman spotted some strange objects flying at fairly high altitude and before long, the entire fighter group was out peering through binoculars at these groups of objects coming over in very strange patterns. But unlike fighters, they would almost stop in their forward velocity and change 90 degrees in their flight path. We never could get close enough to pin them down, but they were round in shape and very metallic-looking.""I'd like to point out that most astronauts are very reluctant to even discuss UFOs due to the great numbers of people who have indiscriminately sold fake stories and forged documents abusing their names and reputations without hesitation,"" Cooper said.Jones said it's important to be cautious about unusual aerial objects.""Even from people that I respect, like a couple of very early and famous astronauts, I haven't seen the proof that would satisfy me that there's really something there,"" he said. ""And I think it's far more likely that people who see unexplained things in the sky, there's no proof that they're actually intelligently guided or alien spaceships of any kind.""Until all these people running around with cellphones and video cameras now can really produce something that's really grabbing, I don't think that I should change my mind about it.""

Not long ago, one reader wrote about me after reading a column of mine, ""(I) have the sneaking suspicion that, given his bio (emphasis added), he probably has all the things in his life he is telling us we'll never have and to just suck up and move on.""I was taken aback. I know how much I have struggled, but of course, the readers don't. They have no reason to know. Or care.And I understand that to some, words in my bio like ""Yale"" touch a nerve and generate a knee jerk reaction of, well of course, someone with those sorts of credentials must have it made.But the resume never tells the whole story. It rarely tells more than a sliver of the story, and that sliver is intended to make us look fabulous, bursting with accomplishments, devoid of failures and blemishes.Thirty years ago, I thought I was going to rule the world, or at least be in the small cohort of people who did. I had lots of degrees from schools revered by many, but reviled by many as well. The path looked pretty rosy.Life then intruded. It usually does. The path got exceedingly thorny, and it became clear that if I could barely control my own tiny corner of the world, I was unlikely to rule anything.So beware the lure of the resume. Not everyone who goes to ""elite"" schools is a millionaire. Or even an elitist. When I attend one of my reunions, I try to avoid asking my classmates questions about how they are doing economically because I don't want to be asked those questions in return (one nice thing about getting older is that reunion questions now focus more on joint replacements and grandchildren than financial successes).Not everyone who lives in a nice town lives in a mansion, or belongs to the country club or drives a nice car. (When I go to my Sunday morning touch football games, I am painfully aware that my scratched 11-year-old Prius, parked next to my teammates BMWs, is tangible evidence of how far from ""ruling the world"" I have strayed.) I shouldn't be surprised when people make wildly inaccurate assumptions about others based on almost no information, but I still am surprised. Making snap judgments based on little information takes all that messy effort and work out of actually learning about people. My entire life, I have loved hearing people's life stories. I love interviewing people, and have found that almost everyone, by the time they are 40 or 50 or 60, have a patchwork of joys, traumas, setbacks, triumphs and diversions from the paths they expected to take. Their stories almost always differ from, and are more enlightening than, their resumes. I also know that most people don't enjoy hearing life stories as much as I do. Most people prefer to talk about themselves, or tear down others about whom they know very little.So when the nasty personal comments come after I write about what a dangerous egomaniac Trump is, I shouldn't be surprised (though I still am amazed by how many of Trump's supporters don't seem to mind that their guy can't help himself from boasting often about his Ivy League education and how smart he is).I want to tell my nasty comment writers about the struggles I have navigated post-Yale, how my resume has not insulated me from financial tsunamis, and how sadly amusing I find it when people who don't know me assume I ""have it made.""A resume a micro story, usually the most positive version of that story that its author can dream up, often stretching the definition of truth. But it never tells the whole story. And the whole story is usually worth hearing.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

After Coffman came forward with her story, she quickly gained support from other women in the music industry -- one of them being musician Bethany Cosentino. Cosentino, one half of the rock duo Best Coast, stopped by ""The Daily Show"" Thursday night to promote Best Coast's new album. She also spoke about sexism in the music industry and why she decided to publicly support Coffman. ""As a woman I felt it was so important to support my peer, my female peer,"" Cosentino told ""The Daily Show's"" Trevor Noah. ""I didn’t realize that it was going to become such a huge thing. I thought, you know what, I’m going to back Amber because that’s what I feel that I should do, this is an incredibly important conversation that I think we should have.”Cosentino added that sexual harassment isn't specific to the music industry. “Sexism and sexual harassment… It’s everywhere. It doesn’t exist just in my industry which is music,"" she said. Watch the full interview below. Towards the end of the conversation, Noah asked Cosentino how female musicians strike a balance between sex appeal and empowerment: ""How do you find the balance -- how do we respect Nicki Minaj but also find out what an anaconda needs to do with her?""While Noah's delivery of the question was undoubtedly uncomfortable, Cosentino made up for it with her answer.""What Nicki Minaj does with Nicki Minaj’s body is Nicki Minaj’s choice,"" Cosentino said. ""What Nicki Minaj sings about, what she chooses to wear -- that’s her business.""Oh, hell yes. "
