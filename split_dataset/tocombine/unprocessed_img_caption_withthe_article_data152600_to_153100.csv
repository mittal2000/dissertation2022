Color Enhanced, SEM. L. monocytogenes is quite hardy and resists the deleterious effects of freezing, drying, and heat remarkably well for a bacterium that does not form spores. Most L. monocytogenes are pathogenic to a degree. Bacteriocins are proteinaceous toxins produced by bacteria to inhibit the growth of similar or closely related bacterial strain.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d3cae3c00005b000a1164.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the last few years, as many as one in five people infected with Listeria died as a result of their infection. The shocking figure comes from a new report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC).""Listeria strikes hard at pregnant women, the elderly, and people with weakened immune systems,” said CDC director Tom Frieden in a press release. “We need to develop new cutting edge molecular technologies to help us link illnesses and outbreaks to foods faster to prevent illness and death, which is why the President’s Budget proposes investing in new tools to advance this work.”Food Safety News points out that President Obama's budget for 2014 includes a $40 million investment for the CDC's Advanced Molecular Detection Initiative, which aims to improve the agency's ability to detect outbreaks.According to the report, Listeria is the third-leading cause of food poisoning deaths. About 1,600 people are sickened by Listeria germs in the U.S. every year, 90 percent of whom are pregnant women, newborns, people over the age of 65 or those with compromised immune systems.Several high-profile Listeria outbreaks in recent years have certainly influenced these figures. In late 2011, a string of sickenings traced to tainted cantaloupes became the deadliest Listeria outbreak in a decade."

But Woodland Hills, California residents Chris and Colleen Otcasek were in for a much bigger surprise than most. Although the couple already knew that there was an underground bunker on their property, they had no idea what the nuclear fallout shelter contained -- or that it was so well-preserved. “I didn’t expect it to look like this,” new owner Chris Otcasek told CBS Los Angeles. “I guess I just figured it would be like a hole.”Nuclear engineer Alvin Kaufman installed the shelter in 1961 fifteen feet below ground to protect his family from radiation in the case of a nuclear attack. Inside, the Otcaseks found sleeping bags, a water tank, coffee cans and canned food in addition to products like Dixie cups, paper towels, Saran Wrap and Kleenex, all in their original (now vintage) packaging. Science fiction magazines, board games and a thirty-year calendar were also inside. ""In that era, in the 60s, there was a much greater fear and feeling that a nuclear war was possible,"" Kaufman's daughter, Debra, who grew up in the house, told CBS Los Angeles. Oddly enough, this isn't the first preserved, fully-stocked fallout we've come across from that era. The Zwick family in Neenah, Wisconsin recently discovered a similar selection of goods while exploring their own yard. Southern California Public Radio featured extraordinary photos of the contents in the slideshow below. Have something to say?

And his belief that cheating can sometimes save a marriage is garnering him attention of late.Savage stopped by Seattle's Q13 Fox station this week to talk about his views on infidelity and his new book, American Savage. Savage said that when two partners have different sexual needs, cheating can be a way to keep their marriage alive.""If one person is completely done with sex and the other person is not done with sex, what do you advise people to do in that circumstance? Divorce? Traumatize their children?"" he said. ""I look at that and I say 'You know, do what you need to do to stay married and stay sane. And maybe that involves cheating, but as the lesser of two evils. Divorce is an evil, cheating is an evil, there are circumstances in which cheating is the lesser evil.""Watch the clip above to hear more of Savage's take, then click through the slideshow below to test your knowledge of celebrity cheating scandals.Keep in touch!

When I get there late from traveling, or when I roll in late after a night shoot on a film production, I see Willie and we catch up. Willie is a world class bowler, averaging well into the 200s. He's even rolled at least one perfect 300 score -- 12 strikes in a row. As an avid, decent bowler in my youth, I can carry on a good bowling conversation with Willie. I also update him on my latest doings, especially as relates to the film industry and show business. I feel as though we are engaged in a conversation of friendship that is interrupted by my time away from here but is picked up without missing a beat when I return. On this night, our conversation includes a famous actor I know and am about to work with who has been through some recently-publicized scandal in his personal life, but whom I know to be a good man in many ways. Willie nods his head and then says: ""Yeah Robert, people make mistakes... that's why pencils have erasers!"" Helping me into my aunt's apartment with my bags, we bid each other a hushed, smiling good night as I close the door, enriched by this encounter and by Willie's way of seeing things.info@kindsightfoundation.org www.robertzuckerman.comFor more by Robert G.
