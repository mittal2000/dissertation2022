""I am setting up a calendar ... two years to create a policy for work and competitiveness. I am accelerating,"" he said.Hollande's speech was clearly aimed at turning around perceptions that he is not moving fast enough.""I know where I am going. I will assume all the responsibility and I will talk regularly to the French people,"" he said.Hollande, whose immediate challenge will be to find 30 billion euros ($38.40 billion) in savings in the 2013 budget, said the government would lower its growth forecast to 0.8 percent from 1.2 percent for next year.""Growth has been shrinking for several months. We will be just over zero percent in 2012 ... so I have asked the government to base the predictions on realistic forecasts. It will be inferior to 1 percent, probably 0.8 percent,"" he said.The budget is expected to be the most austere in 30 years as France tries to hit a deficit target of 3 percent of gross domestic product next year or risk losing investors' trust.It will be presented at a Sept. 28 Cabinet meeting, which has been pushed back by two days to allow for Hollande's trip to the United Nations' General Assembly in New York. SLIDING RATINGSHollande said last week that by holding state spending steady next year in nominal terms, excluding debt servicing and pension payments, his government would save 10 billion euros in inflation-adjusted terms.However, that would amount to just one third of the more than 30 billion euros in savings which Hollande says are needed to hit next year's deficit target and stay on course to balance the budget by the end of his five-year mandate.With his government refusing to cut staffing levels, the bulk of the adjustment will have to come from tax rises.He said the remaining 20 billion euros would come from tax hikes on companies and wealthier households.""It's a considerable effort, it's never been done in the history of the Vth Republic, but it's my responsibility,"" he said.Having won a May election with 51.6 percent of the vote, Hollande's ratings have slid below 50 percent in less than half the time it took Sarkozy to fall from favour.A BVA poll published for Le Parisien on Sunday suggested that almost 60 percent of French people are ""relatively unhappy"" with the president's start compared with 34 percent on May 31. A second survey from pollsters Opinionway showed his popularity rating falling 14 points to 46 percent since June.Hollande said he expected unemployment, which is at 13 year highs, to begin to fall within a year as his proposals to create 80,000 subsidised jobs and to hire 60,000 people in the education sector as well as a so-called ""generation contract"" to encourage companies to hire young workers kicks in.The new Socialist head of state has tried to break from his predecessor Nicholas Sarkozy's pushy manner, promising to consult with social partners but gave unions until the end of the year to reach a ""historic compromise"" on labour reform or said the government would act unilaterally.""He seemed to be a totally helpless president, expressing hopes for growth, some minor measures that practically came from the (President Francois) Mitterrand era,"" Marine Le Pen, president of the far-right National Front, said. ""It was almost prehistoric, but what he did confirm was that he would punch a hole of 33 billion euros in the middle classes."""

The Treasury will also lose the ability to dictate the terms of further stock sales.AIG said it would buy up to $5 billion of the offering. Last week the company sold part of its stake in the Asian insurer AIA to help fund that buyback.A number of analysts who follow AIG said at the time they were disappointed the company was not buying back more shares, although they also assumed the eventual government offering would be much smaller than it has turned out to be.Barclays Capital, in a research note Friday, said investors were likely to be disappointed if the government was not out of the stock by the November election. POLITICS AT PLAY?The sale, Treasury's biggest sell-down of its AIG stake so far, comes as President Barack Obama campaigns for a second term and has been forced to defend his support of decisions to use taxpayer money to prop up companies during the financial crisis.The administration has been unwinding its position in the politically unpopular financial crisis programs ahead of the election, amid heavy Republican campaign pressure over the value of the bailouts, with more than 300 small banks having yet to repay taxpayers.The government also still owns 74 percent of Ally Financial Inc, the former General Motors auto finance unit that was wrecked by bad mortgage loans.Likewise, The government has redeemed all of its holdings of Citigroup Inc except for $3 billion of preferred securities on which it receives an 8 percent dividend.But the Treasury has steadfastly denied it was rushing to exit the AIG stake before the election, a stance it reiterated on Sunday, even as the repeated profitable sales of the insurer's stock burnished the reputation of the crisis-era rescue programs. That boost could help the president in his election battle with Republican nominee Mitt Romney.The announcement also comes in the week that the Federal Reserve is expected to announce it is providing the U.S. economy with further monetary stimulus, probably through a third round of so-called quantitative easing.Expectations of the Fed action helped to drive the S&P 500 to its highest level in more than four years last week, meaning market conditions could be welcoming for the larger AIG sale. The stock has also benefited from that run-up, gaining more than 10 percent in the last month. MORE TO COMEWith the Treasury's break-even point at $28.72 and AIG shares closing Friday at $33.99, this sale is likely to be profitable as were the government's four prior offerings of the company's stock.If the Treasury were to sell $18 billion at AIG's Friday closing price, it would be selling roughly 529 million shares.Treasury said it will also grant to the underwriters a 30-day option to purchase up to an additional $2.7 billion of common stock to cover any over-allotments. If that option were exercised in full, it would cut Treasury's stake in the company closer to 15 percent.The announcement on Sunday comes just a month after the Treasury sold 188.5 million AIG shares for $5.75 billion in a public offering. That sale was priced at $30.50 per share.AIG executives, among them CEO Bob Benmosche, have said of late they expect the government to be out of the insurer by 2013.Benmosche, who has been fighting cancer while running the company over the last couple of years, is widely credited with saving AIG from a fire sale of assets and redirecting it toward the form it has taken today.The company's three pillars are the global property insurer Chartis, the U.S. life insurance and annuity company SunAmerica and the market-leading mortgage insurer United Guaranty.Still to be determined is the fate of airplane leasing business ILFC. AIG filed to take it public last year, but the planned offering has languished amid weak markets."

Belgian newspaper La Libre Belgique was the first to break the news of Arnault's decision on Saturday. According to a Google translation of the article, Georges Dallemagne, chairman of naturalization committee, said ""the case will be treated like any other. There are 47,000 on the table. Our committee received the request last week.""In a statement, LVMH confirmed Arnault's request, but also maintained the billionaire ""is and remains"" a taxpayer in France, according to the Wall Street Journal. Business Insider reported that French paper Le Monde has already speculated openly about a possible motivation for the defection. ""The motivations of the owner of LVMH are not known, but it is more than probable that Mr. Arnault wants to enjoy the lower tax provided by Belgium,"" the article states.A socialist president who took office in the midst of Europe's continuing economic crisis, France's Francoise Hollande faces an uphill battle to get his country's finances back on track.The government is contemplating closing many of the current tax code's 500 or so loopholes, as well increasing the tax on dividends and stock options, according to The New York Times. More than 70 percent of such increases would affect the wealthiest citizens.Worries about a potential mass exodus of the rich have been fueled in part by Hollande's campaign platform, which included a proposal to raise the marginal tax rate to 75 percent on income above €1 million per year.While the real reason for Arnault's actions remain unclear, President Hollande can rest fairly easy. According to the Associated Press, the billionaire's passport change will not affect his tax situation. In France, taxes are determined by residency, not citizenship. "

The allies have objected to across-the-board cuts on wages and pensions to shield poorer Greeks from further misery.Athens argues that it needs two more years to push through the austerity cuts because of a deepening recession, but the country's lenders - exasperated by failed promises to reform - have demanded the country first deliver on its pledges before seeking any concessions.Greece faces bankruptcy and a potential euro zone exit without the next tranche of aid, an issue that European leaders are expected to decide on next month.

Or maybe 2007. But it sure felt like the PGA Tour had called in a throwback weekend.Vijay Singh, Phil Mickelson, and Tiger Woods joining to script a big part of the story line on yet another day of premium scoring conditions at Crooked Stick Golf Club? Who is broadcasting this BMW Championship, the History Channel? Here they are with a combined 56 years of PGA Tour service, 21 major championships, and $233,915,594 to sit 1-2-3 in career money (for the record, the order would be Woods, Singh, Mickelson) and darned if they aren’t at the center of things here at this week’s third FedEx Cup playoff tournament.Crazy, sports world, eh? Because on a weekend when baseball’s brightest pitching star is shelved at the tender of 24 out of concerns for his health, guys who have been going head-to-head in this PGA Tour business since the first Clinton Administration are still strutting their stuff.Chalk it up to the glory of golf and give credit to these FedEx Cup playoffs for keeping the lads’ interest deep into the calendar, but there was ticklish fun to look up at a leaderboard and see the tour’s dominant names for so many years throwing down a combined 22 birdies – and who cares that Mother Nature has turned this Pete Dye creation into a shooting gallery.It’s a delectable leaderboard. Wouldn’t you agree, Mr. Phil?“The only glimpse (of the leaderboard) I saw did not have me on top, so I still have some work to do.”Come on, Lefty, don’t spoil the storyline , and besides, you spoke too soon after your blistering round of 8-under 64. That’s because an hour later, Singh three-putted from just over 40 feet to bogey the par-4 18th to squander his lead and drop into a deadlock with Mickelson at 16-under 200.That’s right, Mickelson and Singh will anchor today’s sprint to the finish line – and there’s no other way to describe what will unfold in Round 4 of the BMW than to call it that. A sprint. No playing it safe at a tournament where par is akin to slamming it in reverse.“I’m going to be aggressive,” Singh promised.Chances are, so will the others, because on a week of brutal rain, Crooked Stick, while not totally defenseless, certainly isn’t going to strike fear into the hearts of the glitzy titanium-toting crowd that is chasing a $1.44 million check. While the field average for Round 3 crept closer to the par of 72 (it was 70.771, up from 69.471 and 69.814), there are green lights all over this place.Now normally such soft and cushy conditions make tournament officials cringe, because birdie-fests tend not to offer the separation between the really good and the pretty good. This week is the exception and while we glow about the presence of titans named Mickelson, Singh and Woods, the wider focus includes arguably the best 54-hole leaderboard on the 2012 PGA Tour season.Of the top eight names, six are ranked 22nd or better, and all of them generate a bit of a buzz.Having matched his best round of the season, Mickelson hurdled 13 players to get into a share of the lead with Singh, who posted 69, his highest score thus far. But at 16 under, it’s not like they can consider it a two-man race, not with a pair of heralded Brits, Rory McIlroy (69) and Lee Westwood (68) tugging at their tails. At 14 under and just two off the lead, Adam Scott (66) is tied with Dustin Johnson (67) and Robert Garrigus (66), who seemingly wasn’t a factor until he eagled the par-5 15th, birdied the par-4 16th, and birdied the par-3 17th.And as if that’s not enough star power for you, there’s a certain icon sitting alone in eighth, his round of 1-under 71 feeling like 81, and leaving a sour taste in his mouth, even if he is at 13 under and just three back.Woods was still smoldering about the way in which he began the day, one that looked even worse when compared to a guy like Mickelson. Whereas the lefthander went out in 32 with five birdies, Woods played the front in 38 with four bogeys.“I wasn’t playing very good. I didn’t hit any good shots,” said Woods, who began the day just one off Singh’s lead. “I needed to get back in the tournament.”He did just that, starting with a chip-in birdie at the ninth, which he followed with birdie rolls at the 10th, 11th, and 13th. Though he rode home with five pars, Woods was in a better mood. “I’m within reach.”True, but the problem for Woods is this – so are a lot of other talented names.The fact that one of them is Singh might come as a surprise to those who focus on the age (49) and the fact that he hasn’t won since 2008, but it’s doesn’t faze Scott at all.“It wasn’t that long ago he was dominating us, winning more than anyone,” said Scott, who birdied five of eight holes starting at the par-4 eighth to ignite his charge. “I’m not really surprised. He seems pretty motivated the last few months.”Truth is, the motivation level of the PGA Tour’s finest is worth embracing because for a third straight week, the FedEx Cup playoffs have delivered.

The NFL host (and moonlighting play by play man) has signed a new contract with ESPN on the 33rd anniversary of the network's launch. I can already hear the dancing in the streets. As is custom with the annoucement of previous re-signings, ESPN has not released any details of the new contract, only labeling it a ""multi-year extention."" However, ESPN does say the new contract will keep him on Bristol airwaves until near his 40th year with the network. Given that Berman joined ESPN just after its launch in 1979, that means we'll see his Vaudeville circus until well into the 2010s. Here's what ESPN President John Skipper had to say:“On the day we commemorate our company’s birthday, it’s fitting we extend our relationship with Chris, arguably the most recognizable face and voice in ESPN’s history. Since arriving in Bristol in 1979, Chris’ passion and enthusiasm, and, of course his signature highlights, have long been his trademarks, earning him a special place among fans for more than three decades.” Clearly, Chris Berman has his fans to this day, but his performance art has certainly grown old with a sizeable swath of football fans. That's not to mention fans of the Home Run Derby and golf's US Open where Berman's sizeable persona dominates and distracts from the event itself. Perhaps no assigment in sports has been as heavily critiiczed as Chris Berman's work at the US Open, but never fear, ESPN has ensured that will continue for the next several years. Instead of embracing evolution in presenting sports, ESPN will continue to take us back, back, back, back to 1986 year after year after year. I already tried watching Hot Tub Time Machine once and had to turn it off after 25 minutes. To all you Trey Wingo fans and fans of coherent, cogent television personalities, I'm sorry. At least we know we'll have plenty of material throughout this decade."

John Elway lured Manning to Denver with a five-year, $96 million deal, yet the 36-year-old quarterback is admittedly on a year-to-year basis, which means he's all about winning now, not presiding over a rebuilding project.

Five matchups I am focused on—starting with Jimmy Graham vs. the ‘Skins safeties.1. Jimmy Graham vs. Redskins’ safeties: Backside of 3x1. In the NFL that’s a high alert for the slant or the fade (front side “Tare” route). The question for Washington: do they have the talent at the safety position to matchup to Graham when he is removed from the core of the formation? Think technique here when playing from a press or off-man position to have a shot vs. the TE. This Saints’ offense is loaded with skill players that can create favorable matchups, but limiting Graham has to be a priority for Jim Haslett’s defense.2. Frank Gore vs. Packers’ run-front: The base power game in the NFL (Power O, Counter OF, Lead, Wham, etc.) That’s what I expect from Gore and the Niners to test the run front of the Green Bay defense. That leads to play action for QB Alex Smith and deep ball opportunities outside of the numbers. For the Packers, its starts with the ability to read your run-pass keys (High Hat=Pass, Low Hat=Run). Strike and shed, be sound in your run fits and wrap up. Can’t allow Gore to produce after contact.3. Peyton Manning vs. Steelers’ pressure: Can the Steelers’ defense force Manning to throw them one? You know what you are going to see from Dick LeBeau’s unit: multiple fronts, pre-snap disguise, zone pressure, some 2-Man, etc. And the pressure is the key here. Put hits on Manning, make him dump the ball, drive down hill and tackle. Give the Broncos' QB time and he can methodically work over the secondary. I'm excited to see Manning play again.4. Andrew Luck vs. Brian Urlacher: Think Cover 2 here. That’s how I would test out the knee of the Bears’ MLB. Run the inside vertical seam (Fleener, Wayne) and force Urlacher to open his hips and match speed down the field. The Bears will play some 8-Man fronts (Cover 1, Under 10, Cover 3, Zone Pressure), but on 3rd and 7-plus, I would look for Tampa 2. Force Urlacher to run and find out if he is truly healthy.5. Jets’ O-Line vs. Bills’ defensive front: This Buffalo D-Line is stacked: Mario Williams, Marcell Dareus, Kyle Williams and Mark Anderson. The ability to get home with four and play some Cover 2, Cover 4 or 2-Man in the secondary vs. QB Mark Sanchez. The Jets need to win in and early down and distance situations to set up 3rd and 2-6—where they have the entire playbook to work with. Win up front, use the boot game and get some production from RB Shonn Greene. Then you can get creative on 3rd down, use Tim Tebow and move the sticks.Follow me on Twitter: @MattBowen41"

As with every medical treatment, there can be problems and pitfalls. Here are the ""medication don'ts"" that every parent should know:DON'T GIVE THESE MEDICATIONS  [Advice continues below slideshow.]Don't guess at a dose.  This can be particularly important for over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen, diphenhydramine or ibuprofen. Sometimes the label will have weight guidelines, some will have age guidelines, sometimes the guidelines are only for adults. If it's not completely clear what you should do, call your doctor for help.Don't give extra.  Just because something works well doesn't mean more of it will work better. Extra can be dangerous. Extra acetaminophen, for example, can cause serious -- sometimes fatal -- liver damage. Don't give more than prescribed and don't give it more frequently than prescribed.Don't give herbal or homeopathic medications without checking with your doctor first.  These are mostly quite safe, and many can be helpful. But some can have serious side effects, and could possibly interact with other medications your child is taking.Don't think that a trip to the medicine cabinet substitutes for a trip to the doctor.  Parents know their children well, and may have lots of experience when it comes to taking care of illnesses and injuries, but making diagnoses and prescribing medications can be tricky. That's why they make us go to all those years of school to be doctors. That's the thing to remember: You and your doctor should work as a team. It's the best way to make medications -- and everything else about health care -- work as well as they can for your child.Keep all medications and poisons out of reach, and if your kid gets into something, call Poison Control at 1-800-222-1222 (works anywhere in the US)."

If you're not familiar with the story already, it's here: The Target PostWhen I originally wrote a post on Target's Facebook wall, I had no idea the sort of attention it would receive, but once I realized it, I probably should have made it more of a priority to talk directly to the store. Last night, I resolved to get them, at the very least, on the phone. I was too late. This morning, eight days after the wall post, I spoke to the store manager.Having never experienced this sort of viral interest in something I've said or written, I wasn't properly prepared for it. What I learned from it was probably something that I should have already known; that when you post something for public scrutiny... the public will scrutinize it. Hard.There are things I would have done differently, there are specifics I would have left out. There are rumors that I would have investigated prior to dismissing. Looking back, I know my heart was in the right place, but once the shit hit the fan, I probably should have reacted more quickly.Right... I know... the store manager... I'm getting to that. First, my apologies:1. I am sorry that I so cavalierly dismissed the notion that Target was anti-gay. While hundreds of comments addressed this so thoroughly that I can't do them more justice, Target's CEO contributed to the campaign of a very anti-gay MN gubernatorial candidate. A post was written about it here: Target Homophobia?Their rationale was that he was pro-business, but when you back someone like that, you have to know that you're backing ALL of him, not just the pro-business part. When you give hundreds of thousands of dollars to support a candidate, you probably should have made your peace with his whole platform. Because people will find out. I've seen references to things Target corporate has done since to attempt to repair the damage they did to their relationship with the LGBT community, but it's really not my fight. As I've tried to make clear, I'm not a Target corporate apologist -- I just liked that the store hired a guy with autism. The point is, I shouldn't have dismissed it without checking it out. As one reader pointed out, had it been my daughter and an anti-special needs contribution, would I have just assumed it was a myth, or would I have gone out and investigated it? I know the answer to that.Right... I know... the store manager. One more thing:2. I am even more sorry that I potentially outed or exposed the cashier without knowing whether he was comfortable with that sort of exposure or that acknowledgement. While I still believe what makes the story great is that he is an autistic (please let's not argue person first about this. Please!) adult working (in an atmosphere where so many people regardless of diagnosis are unemployed) and doing a fantastic job. When Huffington Post ran the re-post from my blog, they removed references to the city and the description of the cashier. I should have done the same thing on my own blog post right at that moment. Prior to that, I hadn't even considered the ramifications... but when they spiked it out in the edits... I should have done the math. I have since done the same with my original post. Of all the people who should be more sensitive to the social (or not so social) nature of autism, I should have been more aware that the enormous public scrutiny might be highly unwelcome.So I finally spoke to the store manager. I complimented the cashier. I explained my concerns. And she told me this:He's doing great. His autism was not a secret. They told him about the story, specifically that he'd been recognized by a customer for great service (I don't know what else he was told about it). He was then recognized at a team meeting for his excellent work and given a ""team card"" (I have no idea what that is) and something else. I don't know what that ""something else"" was, she said, but I'd already said ""what"" about a hundred times at that point, attempting to confirm bits and pieces of the overall puzzle while we talked so I just felt sorta warm and fuzzy that he'd gotten something out of the deal. She said he's an asset to the store. She said he does so many things for them, not just cashiering, and that he has a great work ethic.I told her I was concerned that he might be uncomfortable with the extra attention and she told me that she'd talk to HR to make sure, but that he seemed happy and hadn't come to her with any complaints. All's well that ends well? Maybe, with the caveat that I hope I learned my lesson moving forward. I hope that's the end of it. I hope that it's all positive and not negative, but I'm a realist. Still, all things considered, this seems like it's been a good experience for everyone who isn't pissed off about how bad the post jacked up their Facebook newsfeed for the past week."
