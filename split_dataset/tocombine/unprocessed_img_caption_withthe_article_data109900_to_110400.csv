Skurka, Contributors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-political-education-o_b_5837850.html,On paper Farenthold's district ought to be competitive. The reality is that it probably is not.,2014-09-17,"UNITED STATES - MAY 8: Rep. Blake Farenthold, R-Texas, participates in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing on 'Benghazi: Exposing Failure and Recognizing Courage' on Wednesday, May 8, 2013. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d4226f260000342951ec22.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Congressman Blake Farenthold (Texas-Corpus Christi) rode the wave of tea party enthusiasm into the U.S. House in 2010, defeating 27-year veteran Democrat Solomon Ortiz by less than 800 votes. Farenthold's questions about President Barack Obama's citizenship, his call for Attorney General Eric Holder's resignation over the so-called Fast and Furious gun tracking scandal, as well as his statement that the House has the votes to impeach the president attracted Bill Maher's disdain and made him one of the first nominees for Maher's ""flip-a-district"" campaign. On paper Farenthold's district ought to be competitive. The reality is that it probably is not.Former House Speaker Thomas ""Tip"" O'Neill said that ""all politics is local."" However polarized national politics has become, Congressman Farenthold has learned how to stay faithful to his tea party principles while learning how to be a successful legislator who is attentive to his constituents' local economic interests. Robert Draper's 2012 book, Do Not Ask What Good We Do, depicts Farenthold confiding to his constituents that the Constitution's authors made governmental action deliberately difficult. Farenthold may have discovered the first lesson of successful congressional politics: sometimes even a person of principle must compromise if he hopes to accomplish anything. Although the congressman takes pride in his colorful sound bite attacks on the Obama administration, his legislative record is more moderate than his rhetoric. The National Journal places his voting record comfortably in the middle of all House Republicans. He is also a successful legislator, ranking in the top twenty percent of representatives who have won passage for their bills. Local observers testify that he is sensitive to his constituents. Sequestration, bans on earmarks, and Republican resistance to new spending has made the traditional ""bring home the bacon"" kind of congressional politics more difficult. Farenthold has successfully shifted to a ""lean pork"" strategy, moving pet projects through the budget process and bringing federal money home such as a contract to test drones. He also cosponsored a successful bipartisan bill to improve trade along the US-Mexico border by encouraging public-private initiatives.Farenthold's sprawling House district includes 13 counties, reaching from the Texas coast to the central Texas hill country. When the federal court redrew the district in 2012, it reduced a majority-minority district with an overwhelming 73 percent Hispanic population to a less Hispanic heavy 50 percent. While non-Hispanic whites constitute only 43 percent of the district, the low turnout of minority voters in 2012 helped to reelect Farenthold by an 18 percent margin over a locally well-known Democratic challenger. The district clearly leans Republican given that Mitt Romney bested Barack Obama by 23 points in the last presidential vote.Democrats hoped that Farenthold would be vulnerable in 2014. The district looked like it could competitive. A 2014 Immigration Policy Center study places it among the twelve Republican districts with the highest number of naturalized Hispanics and Asian citizens. Democrats across the nation are funding Battleground Texas' efforts, modeled on President Obama's successful tactics in his 2008 and 2012 campaigns, to turn Texas blue by 2016. Battleground Texas has targeted Farenthold's district as one of its opportunities to galvanize a Democratic surge. It supports State Senator Wendy Davis's campaign for governor, betting that the national attention focused on her filibuster against a restrictive abortion bill would translate into a successful run. So far, she has not gained the traction she needs according to a September CBS/New York Times poll showing her 18 points behind her Republican opponent. Pundits predict Republican gains in the Senate and in the House this November. Perhaps this is why the best known and well-funded Democrats in the district chose to sit out this House election, leaving the party nomination in the hands of an inexperienced, poorly funded opponent, Wesley Reed. Marine Corps veteran Reed has raised $ 169,433 as of June 30 and Farenthold is currently outspending him by over $700,000. Normally, challengers must spend at least $ 800,000 to stay competitive with House incumbents. Reed's campaign is also lagging behind Farenthold's in social media hits and local media coverage.Marines are not known to run from a fight, but this may not be the opportune time for this particular fight. It is wise that Mr. Maher opted to target a Minnesota Republican instead.This post is part of a series about ""Real Time with Bill Maher"" 's ""Flip a District"" initiative.

1,SPORTS,Osteochondral Ankle Surgery: Is This What Shin-Soo Choo's 'Torn Ankle Cartilage Surgery' Was All About?,"Neal M. Blitz, D.P.M., F.A.C.F.A.S., ContributorNYC Aesthetic & Reconstructive Foot & Ankle Surgeon",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/osteochondral-ankle-surge_b_5837958.html,"What started as a sprained ankle back in April for Texas Ranger Shin-Soo Choo, has now progressed into surgery to repair/remove ""torn ankle cartilage.""",2014-09-17,"ARLINGTON, TX - AUGUST 12: Shin-Soo Choo #17 of the Texas Rangers hits in the ninth inning against the Tampa Bay Rays at Globe Life Park in Arlington on August 12, 2014 in Arlington, Texas.

The details regarding the surgery are limited, but as a Manhattan reconstructive foot and ankle surgeon it's my guess is that he had osteochondral lesion repair surgery. Questions have arisen as to why one would wait five months to have surgery after an acute injury, but often with certain cartilage injuries surgery is not the first option. What is an Ankle Osteochondral Injury The ankle joint, like all joints, is lined with cartilage, which allows for two or more bone segments to smoothly glide on one another. Cartilage is a cushy substance that is attached to the underlying the bone at the joint level. Injury to the ankle joint could also injure the cartilage which could be in the form of a bruise, tear/split and/or complete separation. The damage can be small or quite large. These cartilage injuries are medically known as osteochondral injuriesAnkle sprains are well known to injure cartilage as the force of an injury may cause the ankle bones to scuff against each other and focally damage the cartilage. Sometimes the force can be large enough to shear off the cartilage along with a small portion of bone as well. There are predictable injury patterns that occur based on their location with the ankle. Injuries on the inside of the ankle are called medial osteochondral lesions, and those on the outside are called lateral osteochondral lesions. Medial lesions are generally more troublesome as the cartilage damage is usually deeper in the ankle and has more depth, whereas the lateral lesions are more superficial. How Are Osteochondral Injuries Diagnosed? Ankle xrays are the first test to evaluate for injury to the bone. Cartilage is not visible on xrays, but sometimes can be identified if the bone is also injured. Longstanding osteochondral injuries may deteriorate underlying bone which could make them visible on xrays. Otherwise, MRI is the best study to evaluate cartilage and therefore osteochondral injuries. Ankle Osteochondral Surgery Osteochondral injuries dont always require surgery, and depending on the extent of the injury. Surgery is rarely recommended immediately unless the cartilage damage is unstable which could further damage the remaining joint if the fragment dislodged. Its common for surgeons to wait one to six months to see if the cartilage injury can heal on its own.Osteochondral ankle surgery is generally performed using ankle joint arthroscopy. This means that surgeons use small tools and cameras surgeons gain access into the ankle joint to remove scar tissue and work on cartilage issues. The method of cartilage repair depends on the overall extent and chronicity of the lesion. Most of the time, the injured segment of cartilage is removed and the underlying bone is roughened up to allow for new replacement cartilage to grow. More advanced techniques may involved cartilage bone plugs or cartilage implantation - but these are generally for larger chronic lesions. How Will Choo Do? If Shin-Soo Choo did indeed have an osteochondral injury, the prognosis greatly depends on the severity of the injury. It generally seems responsible to not jump into ankle cartilage surgery, which seems to be the case with Choo. Because he requires surgery 5 months later, does not particularly suggest a worse outcome. His outcome will mainly depend on just how much cartilage damage he had after he sprained it. Osteochondral injuries can progress onto ankle arthritis in the long term but there is no indication at this point that is anywhere on the horizon for Choo.

What he doesn't have to worry about, however, is whether or not the United States will split apart, because red-state bile notwithstanding, most folks would rather hold their nose through the second Obama administration than jump ship altogether. Unfortunately, British Prime Minister David Cameron isn't so lucky. He's facing a riled up Scottish population on Thursday that is itching for the opportunity to ditch the U.K. (and him) and go the independence route. Economically and culturally that'd be like the U.S. losing Texas. Which begs the question, what would Texas secession actually look like? How would Americans fare under losing Texas compared to the British losing the Scots? The idea of a Texas secession may seem less likely than the Scots leaving the U.K., but the vote might be a lot closer than anyone in the U.S. would like. Central Government ControlThe United Kingdom is comprised of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with about a million other territories and principalities still falling under U.K. control after a few hundred years of being the world's biggest empire. For the last 30 years various U.K. Prime Ministers (Tony Blair in particular) has been pushing for a ""devolved government"" meaning that Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland have more and more independence from the central government in London. This is, of course, in stark contrast to the United States, whereby all accounts the federal government has expanded its power, control and influence over individual states with increasing taxes, federal subsidies and intervention. Apparently a taste of freedom just excited the Scots more and they began the legal process to have a referendum on leaving the U.K. that will happen on Thursday, September 18. In the United States, despite the historically inaccurate trolling of Rick Perry, Texas actually doesn't have the constitutional right to leave the United States, and given the loss of federal funds, support and military they probably wouldn't.EconomicsThe Scottish independence movement has argued pretty consistently that an independence Scotland would fare better economically than the current member of the U.K. Why? Because relative to the size of Scotland, they actually send more money down to London in taxes to subsidize other parts of the country than they receive back. This is a bit a simplification however. For example, a low tax state like Texas is in many ways subsidized by high tax blue states like California and New York but that doesn't mean if the Longhorn state jumped from the union suddenly blue state America would have more change in their pockets. National economics is also about negotiations, exchanges and relationships. An independent Scotland would have to develop it's own independent trade offices all over the world, and would no longer be able to rely on the U.K. infrastructure, EU exemptions and clout in trade wars across the world. Imagine if Governor turned (president? King? Supreme Ruler?) Rick Perry had to negotiate everything from cattle sales to satellite rates for the Longhorn Network with individual states, cable operators and ESPN. We all know he'd have a little trouble keeping track of more than three trade partners.Foreign PolicyForeign policy is probably the biggest difference in Texas two-step away from America and the Scots leaving London in ""Old Europe"". The Scots don't have particularly large foreign threats to concern themselves with, and what few terror threats they may have can be handled relatively easily. Further, since Scottish ship-building for the United Kingdom is so important they could easily negotiate some sort of boats for protection deal with the now Scot free but Scot dependent United Kingdom. Travel back and forth between the nations could be complicated, but in the interest of both sides, an onerous passport system to drive from Glasgow to London would be unlikely. The same can't be said of an independent Texas and the United States. Texas has enough trouble protecting their borders from illegal immigrants and without federal funding for border patrols the United States would likely make border crossing between Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and other states extremely difficult. Not to mention what the contentious negotiations would be between the Republic of Texas and the United States as to whether over 30 U.S. military installations would stay in the state and at what cost.LeadershipPresident Obama is pretty unpopular in Texas, he's never earned more than 45 percent of the vote in either of his presidential elections and in some counties his job approval ratings are in the single digits. In fact, most of the secessionist cries from Texas (over 1,000,000 signatures actually) came after he was re-elected in 2012. However, Obama's got nothing on David Cameron in the unpopularity department. When he took office in 2010, David Cameron was the first British prime minister in 30 years to have to cobble together a coalition government because his Conservative Tory Party wasn't popular enough to secure an absolute majority. Teamed with the perpetual third wheel Liberal Democrat party Camerons' continued his downward slide, and it's taking a toll on the Scottish independence vote. ""Better Together"" the Scottish movement to stay in the U.K., has repeatedly, politely, asked that the Prime Minister stay out of Scotland during the independence referendum. Cameron's last minute desperate campaign trips to help the ""No"" vote are actually hurting the cause, say activists. He's so unpopular that polls show 54% of Scotts would rather be an independent nation than remain under Cameron's leadership if he's re-elected in 2015.In the end, the result of the Scottish independence vote will have a lasting impact on British Politics, because whether the Scots stay or go, the vote itself is a shock to the U.K. economy that doesn't bode well for incumbents. Here on the other side of the Atlantic we shouldn't be too worried. Chances are pretty low that Texas could try to pull off the same stunt as the Scots, and even if they did failure is almost guaranteed. Now all those Longhorn fans can rest easy, and Obama can keep worrying about holding his fractured party together more than a fractured country.--Dr. Jason Johnson is a professor of Political Science at Hiram College and a frequent guest on Al Jazeera English, CNN and MSNBC.

The two sides in Scotland's independence debate are scrambling to convert undecided voters, with just two days to go until a referendum on separation. Anti-independence campaigners are pushing home their message that a ""No"" vote doesn't mean the status quo. The three main British political parties are promising Scotland greater powers, including tax-raising authority, if it remains part of the United Kingdom. The Yes campaign says the promises are vague and reveal the No side's desperation, with polls suggesting the outcome will be close. Scottish Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said ""the only way to guarantee the real powers we need in Scotland is to vote Yes."" (AP Photo/Scott Heppell)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13d6d2400005500e47841.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Renowned historian Sir Tom Devine has been a prominent voice for the pro-independence campaign in the lead-up to Scotland's big vote on Thursday. But the author and intellectual didn't always hold this view. Devine tells the WorldPost of his journey from being pro-Union to backing independence. Rejecting the referendum as merely a symptom of nationalist fervor, he explains how frustration with the status quo and a historical perspective got him to 'Yes.'What made you switch your mind on whether to vote ""yes"" or ""no"" in Thursday's referendum?The first thing was the enormous error committed by David Cameron, the prime minister of the U.K., in not permitting three questions or options on the ballot paper: Status quo, independence and enhanced devolution. When Cameron made that decision the polls were suggesting that the no camp was very far ahead but that 80 percent of Scots would have preferred an enhanced devolution package. Cameron's decision showed the basic myopia and shortsightedness over the issue. Like so many other disenfranchised voters, I felt I had nowhere to go. I began to realize there were significant and serious problems in the union arrangement and even came to the conclusion that an enhanced devolution package would not solve the problem. Have many Scots followed the same path to the Yes-camp?I think that this realization was actually not there previously to any significant extent, apart among zealots, but has developed during the campaign. That’s the reason why the no-vote has suffered over the last few months in terms of loss of votes -- if the current polls are accurate. How did your position as a historian form the way you perceived this vote? Where does this place within Britain's history?The extent of debate in pubs, among families, around the dinner table, on busses and trains is truly unprecedented. What we study as historians is change, and this is one of the most stunning and powerful and paradoxical changes that I can recall in European history over the last 200 years. How much of this is about the unique character of Scotland and how much is political discontent?It’s a long and complex journey and there are a number of reasons why this has happened. Fundamentally, however, and especially in more recent times, a political cleavage has occurred. While England seems wedded to a right-wing social and political agenda, people in Scotland overwhelmingly vote for leftist parties. Do you think this is in some ways a backlash against measures like austerity?I was asked by a journalist in 2002 whether there would there be an independent Scotland. Actually, the way he asked it was whether there ""would there be a crisis in the union?""As a historian, the future is not my period. I speculated, however, that the union could see a major crisis if the following four factors were in place: a left-wing nationalist majority government in Edinburgh; a right-leaning conservative government -- or in this case, coalition government -- in Westminster; an economic crisis either at the beginning, middle or early end; and finally a lackluster labor party, which would make the Scottish people doubt who would win the next general election and whether they would face another five years of rightist austerity policies. Lo and behold, that perfect storm is now in place.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

He told CBS's ""Face the Nation"" on Sunday, March 23, 2014, that Obama's ""naivete"" and ""faulty judgment"" about Russia has led to a number of foreign policy challenges. He said the U.S. should now welcome nations that seek entry into NATO, should forgo cuts to the nationâs military budget and reconsider putting a missile defense system into the Czech Republic and Poland, as once planned.(AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e69160f230000821839f6c0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After losing in 2012 Mitt Romney stated that he is done running for president... but this is 2014 and rumors are swirling. Before too much is made of Mitt Romney chances in 2016, it is important to realize that history is very much against there ever being a President Romney. We can break this down to a simple three step process. For Romney to be elected in 2016, he would need to: (1) Seek the party nomination, (2) Win the party nomination and (3) Win the general election. The first step is a huge hurdle. It requires the candidate to have emerged from the previous loss sufficiently strong physically, emotionally and politically. This is quite rare. Since 1900, there have been 20 candidates from the two major parties who lost their first general election for the presidency. Only five of those 20 (25 percent) ever formerly tossed their hat into the party nomination ring again. To put it the opposite way, for a variety of reasons, 75 percent of losing candidates decided to never run for president again. As of 2014 the last seven losing presidential candidates of major parties (McCain, Kerry, Gore, Dole, Dukakis, Mondale and Ford) never again sought the party nomination. Romney emerged from the 2012 loss reasonably strong. He did not run a terrible campaign, did not have an embarrassingly weak electoral performance, did not make a disastrous choice for a running mate and will not be considered ""too old"" in 2016. If he does seek the nomination, Romney has to convince Republicans to back him again rather than a different Republican candidate. This is another high hurdle. Of the five losing presidential candidates who sought their party's nomination again, three lost in the primaries: Wendell Wilkie, Hubert Humphrey and George McGovern. This means that of those 20 losing candidates only two (10 percent) made it over the first two hurdles.If Romney wins the Republican nomination, he then has to win enough electoral votes to be elected president, a feat he failed to do in 2012. He would need to energize his base more to improve supporter turnout and/or swing over more votes from the few remaining non-party loyalist voters.Of the two candidates who made it over those first two hurdles, one (Adlai E. Stevenson*) was defeated in his second general election. This leaves only one person since 1900 to have lost his first general presidential election and later succeeded at being elected president -- Richard Milhous Nixon. While a one out of 20 may seem like a long shot, I am sure some pundits are salivating at the opportunity to hear Mitt Romney proudly declare, ""Let me be America's next Richard Nixon.""* Adlai E. Stevenson (Democrat) lost soundly to Dwight D. Eisenhower (Republican) in both the 1952 and the 1956 electionNote: Previously we discussed that a history paints a similarly bleak picture for Paul Ryan's chances of ever being elected president.

Living in the north Seattle metro area, and riding high after realizing his stake in the 2007 sale of aQuantive to Microsoft, Hanauer styles himself ""a proud and unapologetic capitalist""; albeit an atypical one. As to the particulars of his financial assent from a considerable head start (his family owns a national pillow-manufacturing business), a February 2014 Seattle Times article reveals Hanauer as an entrepreneurial businessman with a progressive social conscience and a renegade venture capitalist's understanding of economics.Nick Hanauer's preferred financial model is what he and his intellectual collaborator, Eric Liu (a former speechwriter for President Clinton) call ""middle-out"" economics. As explained in their 2008 book, The True Patriot, ""middle-out economics"" (their coined term) refers to an approach to economic policy based upon the conviction that national prosperity is far more dependent upon the financial capacity of middle-class consumers than the trickle-down investment contributions of the wealthy. Whatever one makes of the theory, it is difficult to make light of what the authors call the ""Patriot's Moral Code,"" available at the True Patriot Network site.In the Patriot's Moral Code, freedom from sacrifice is cowardice, freedom from stewardship is exploitation, and freedom from compassion is cruelty. Purportedly, true patriots ""measure our nation's progress by whether every citizen has a fair shot to advance on the basis of talent and merit, and by the degree to which we promote the common success of all our citizens."" Viewed from this perspective, real opportunity on a level playing field combined with merit (deservedness) is the core of economic justice. Writing to other 'zillionaires' who are thriving ""beyond the dreams of any plutocrats in history,"" Hanauer argues that the problem is not reasonable inequality (which may beneficially motivate people to press for success), but ethically inexplicable inequality. Wielding the provocative metaphor that ""pitchforks are coming for plutocrats"" unless wealth is distributed more broadly, Hanauer urges his ""fellow filthy rich"" to wake-up and exercise constructive policy leadership before the U.S. becomes a police state to keep social unrest at bay.Nick Hanauer's message is part of the mainstreaming of calls for workable political means to address and mitigate growing economic inequality. Widely noted voices making similar calls from various platforms include Pope Francis (Bishop of Rome), U.S. President Barack Obama, Lawrence Summers (former President of Harvard University), Joseph Stiglitz (a Nobel Prize winning American economist), and Thomas Piketty (a best-selling French economist). Everywhere one turns, respected opinion leaders are articulating concerns about growing economic inequality. Why, then, has there been so little concerted political effort to corral the growing inequality problem? Is the American party and campaign system broken, as some astute observers believe? Could real and constructive change come if a billionaire patrician would step up and do the right thing?There is no shortage of proffered answers to inequality dilemmas. The diagnostic diversity includes everything from soup to nuts, with alleged solutions ranging across a wide spectrum. Highly variant opinion works to dampen citizen movements and stymie town hall initiatives. Even the language of the debate is up for grabs, as explained by scholars Adam Arvidsson and Nicolai Peitersen in their recent Columbia University Press book, The Ethical Economy: Rebuilding Value after the Crisis. In short, if the democratic process cannot remotely approach a consensus as to the root causes of economic inequality, the prospect for sound ameliorative adjustments is even more implausible. The alternative is crisis-stimulated policy making in which the working man's ox gets gored by Wall Street's bull.Robert Reich, a U.S. Secretary of Labor under President Bill Clinton, is working hard to counter economic inequality. Leveraging several polemic books and a sobering docu-drama entitled Inequality for All, Reich spotlights wealth distribution trends for young adults. Enjoying a prominent role in the presentation, Nick Hanauer is portrayed almost as a paternalistic protector of the public interest -- the patrimony of his own well-heeled family notwithstanding. By the end of the feature, Hanauer looks less like a ""proud and unapologetic capitalist"" than a patron saint of the working man. But a post-movie reality check is in order. Based on other sources, the CEO of Hanauer's pillow manufacturing company contends that the company's $11 an hour average hourly worker pay at its pillow-making plants in several American states cannot be replaced by a considerably higher pay scale without risking insolvency."

Bush.""That's ridiculous,"" Neil Bush, the current chairman of the foundation, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""It really makes my blood boil to think that someone would make that kind of an allegation, whether it's an independent political group or a candidate for office.""The 30-second television ad, which was paid for by the National Republican Senatorial Committee and approved by Perdue, charges that Nunn's ""foundation gave money to organizations linked to terrorists."" The ad's narrator cites Nunn's ""campaign plan,"" a strategy memo accidentally posted online earlier this year that embarrassingly detailed how Republicans could use her vulnerabilities against her in a heated contest. The memo states that Points of Light gave out ""grants to problematic entities,"" such as international charity Islamic Relief Worldwide. But as FactCheck.org pointed out, the grants referred to funds that eBay sellers donated, not the foundation itself. Moreover, the site found no evidence that Islamic Relief USA, a federally approved charity, was tied to U.S.-designated terrorist group Hamas.The younger Bush vehemently defended Nunn, calling the ad a ""smear"" against the organization founded by his father.""Neither Points of Light nor Michelle Nunn have had anything to do with funneling money from our organization to terrorists organizations. Anyone who makes that claim needs to understand the facts and then they need to denounce those claims,"" Neil Bush said. ""To attack an organization founded by my father, whose integrity is unimpeachable, to smear our organization for political gain, is in my opinion shameful.""The flare-up comes just days after the family patriarch made his endorsement in the race official. Despite Nunn's ties to the former president, George H.W. Bush gave Perdue the nod on Monday and praised him as the ""independent voice for Georgia while working for positive solutions to our toughest challenges."" The announcement, complete with a photo of the Republican candidate smiling with the Bushes, was made while the Perdue ad mentioning Points of Light was already on the air.Nunn, who is currently trailing in the race according to the HuffPost Pollster polling average, invoked the younger Bush's words and called on Perdue to take down the ad. ""I was appreciative of what Neil Bush said yesterday,"" the Democrat said in a Wednesday statement. ""Washington can learn a lot from organizations like Points of Light. But David Perdue playing politics and falsely attacking an organization that helps so many is exactly what's wrong with Washington and politics today. David Perdue should take down his dishonest ads and quit falsely attacking Points of Light.""But Wednesday morning, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Perdue had doubled down on the charge by airing a new ad. In addition to citing ""terrorism,"" the spot claims that Nunn was ""for amnesty, while terrorism experts say our border breakdown could provide an entry for groups like ISIS."""
9,POLITICS,House Votes To Audit The Fed... And Deregulate Wall Street,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wall-street-deregulation_n_5838718.html,,2014-09-17,"House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio gives a wink to a reporter as he answers questions with GOP leaders at Republican National Committee headquarters on Capitol Hill in Washington, Tuesday, July 15, 2014. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e6916122600001823b62e06.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly to audit the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, a broadly bipartisan call for financial reform that accompanied two other bipartisan votes providing government perks to Wall Street on everything from higher mortgage fees to speculation in securities markets.The votes underscore unique tensions among both Republicans and Democrats. All three bills garnered strong Republican majorities while essentially splitting Democrats down the middle. ""Today, the House passed the Federal Reserve Transparency Act,"" Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) celebrated in a Vine video. ""Finally, we're gonna audit the Fed.""Of course, the Fed has been audited before. Reps. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) and Ron Paul (R-Texas) secured an amendment to audit the central bank under the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law, and that audit revealed sweetheart deals for big financial firms. But the provision remains unpopular at the Fed, big banks and many Capitol Hill offices. It is unclear if the Senate will take up the most recent audit bill, which passed the House by a vote of 333 to 92. Details about the Fed's lending activities are not generally made public without legislation requiring transparency.Rep. John Campbell (R-Calif.) was the only Republican to vote against auditing the Fed, while Democrats voted 106 to 91 in favor, demonstrating the degree to which central bank transparency has become a mainstream issue. Although the GOP is eager to expose the Fed's dealings with big banks, it is equally anxious to dole out favors to financial operators. Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.) was the only Republican to vote against the two deregulation bills Wednesday, with all other detractors coming from the Democratic Party. Jones, who also voted to audit the Fed, is the only consistent voice for bank reform among House Republicans.One deregulation bill, H.R. 5405, would exempt a significant swath of the market for derivatives -- the complex financial products at the heart of the 2008 meltdown -- from Dodd-Frank's new trading rules.Prior to the 2010 law, derivatives were traded in the dark without regulatory oversight or market scrutiny. Dodd-Frank required most derivatives to go through a central counterparty, which would pay up if either side of the trade failed to make good on its bet -- a scenario designed to prevent another AIG fiasco. H.R. 5405 would exempt financial affiliates of big corporations from these clearing requirements, opening up avenues for speculative trading and systemic risk at major companies that aren't traditionally seen as banking powerhouses. Many large U.S. corporations are involved in banking, most notably General Electric, which received billions of dollars in government relief after its subprime bets blew up in 2008.Americans for Financial Reform, the leading voice for Wall Street accountability on Capitol Hill, came out strong against H.R. 5405 and the other deregulation bill, H.R. 5461.The latter legislation would give banks a way around the Volcker Rule, a ban on their speculating in the securities markets with taxpayer backing. It would weaken rules on bank ownership of collateralized loan obligations, a type of derivative that is dominated by big banks and that pools together many loans into one security. Weakening the rules would make it easier for banks to make big speculative bets with these derivatives and thereby get around the Volcker Rule.H.R. 5461 would also allow banks to charge more in upfront fees when they issue a mortgage while still qualifying for special treatment under the government's ""qualified mortgage"" rules. A bank that abides by QM rules receives the benefit of the doubt in court if a consumer challenges the loan as predatory. To qualify for QM treatment, banks must limit upfront fees to a certain percentage of the loan balance. The new bill would exempt some title insurance fees from that total, effectively freeing banks to charge customers more.Democrats have been divided for much of the year between bank reform advocates and a coalition of deregulation supporters from the corporate-friendly New Democrat caucus and the traditionally progressive Congressional Black Caucus. Those dynamics played out in the two deregulatory votes, with New Democrats like Reps. Ron Kind (D-Wis.) and Jim Himes (D-Conn.) siding with CBC members including Reps. Gregory Meeks (D-N.Y.) and David Scott (D-Ga.). The Fed audit politics are further scrambled for Democrats, with many traditional progressives, like Reps. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) and Maxine Waters (D-Calif.), voting against the bill, while deregulation stalwarts like Scott voted in favor.It's not clear if any of the three House bills will even come up for a vote in the Senate. All of them appear at least moderately controversial in the upper chamber, since none was attached to legislation to fund the government after Sept. 30. As a result, the Senate can approve the funding bill and ignore all three bank measures without risking a government shutdown. "

Dr. Monica Wehby, who is challenging Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), had emphasized her medical background and said it gives her a unique perspective on health care reform. But her plan contains sections that bear a remarkable resemblance to the wording in a survey done for Crossroads GPS, a group founded by GOP strategist Karl Rove. The plagiarism allegations come as Wehby has said her positions are evidence-based, rather than ideological. Merkley's campaign took the opportunity Wednesday to argue that Wehby's policy stances, and the sources for them, are out-of-step with Oregon voters. ""The entire basis for Monica Wehby's campaign is her so-called expertise on health issues, but today Oregonians are learning that Wehby plagiarized her entire health care plan directly from Karl Rove, the hatchet man behind George W. Bush,"" Merkley campaign spokeswoman Lindsey O'Brien said in a statement. ""Monica Wehby copied Mitt Romney's tax plan, plagiarized Karl Rove's health care plan and lifted the rest of her anti-middle class agenda straight from the oil billionaire Koch brothers. There is no question that in the Senate Monica Wehby would be a rubber stamp, voting with Senate Republicans and the billionaire Koch brothers against Oregon's priorities.""Though Wehby spokesman Dean Petrone told BuzzFeed Tuesday that the plagiarism charges were ""absurd,"" they apparently were enough to necessitate removing the content in question.Plagiarism charges have had serious ramifications in other Senate contests. Sen. John Walsh (D-Mont.), for instance, withdrew from the race following allegations that he had plagiarized portions of his master's thesis. UPDATE: 7:24 p.m. -- Wehby's campaign said Wednesday that the staff members who wrote the health reform and economic plans were fired after the plagiarism allegations surfaced. “These website pages were authored by staff who are no longer employed by the campaign and were immediately removed once brought to our attention,"" campaign spokesman Dean Petrone said in a statement. ""Dr. Wehby will continue to fight against Jeff Merkley’s attempts to distract voters from his failure to help middle and working class Oregon families.”"

Across the country numerous protests are planned on what activists are calling a national day of action to 'Draw the Line' on tar sands, Keystone XL, and fracking which many people believe are contributing to climate change and other environmental issues affecting communities. The controversial Keystone XL pipeline project looks to get U.S. permission to funnel CanadaÃs carbon-heavy oil sands across the United States to refineries on the Texas and Louisiana Gulf Coasts.

They've got branding down, relentlessly repeating the mantra, ""science is inconclusive and solutions are exorbitant and unproven."" On the other hand, environmentalists repeat vague Cassandra-like warnings of ""climate change"" and ""global warming,"" supporting dire predictions with confusing statistics, hard-pressed to come up with simple, relevant messages.  Even relatively green media like The New York Times end up reinforcing the fossil fuel messages, especially in their business sections. In an unfortunately common example, Friday's Huffington Post called out The New York Times for ""overhyping the benefits of fracking...(claiming that it was) changing the economic calculus for old industries and downtrodden cities alike."" Fracking equals jobs and a better economy, the article claimed. But Huffington Post reporter Mark Gongloff quoted Dean Baker, co-director of the Center For Economic And Policy Research, who found that in fact fracking communities had a worse record for factory jobs than the U.S. as a whole. Still, when it's reported in The New York Times...  Climate deniers are brilliant at setting up simple, memorable and scary financial calculations that brand climate change activists as prioritizing the environment against the economy. They pit environmental health against jobs. They equate renewable energy with sky-high utility bills. They warn electric cars have no range and will leave you stranded and solar panels will burn your house down. And my favorite, heard quite a bit in the halls of Congress: why should the U.S. pay to clean up the atmosphere when China now emits more greenhouse gas than we do?  Again, even environmentally-friendly media reinforce this trope. The latest is last week's Rolling Stone article titled ""China, the Climate and the Fate of the Planet."" The article is rife with fodder for climate solution obstructionists, starting with author Jeff Goodell's front page called-out quote: ""If the world's biggest polluter doesn't radically reduce the amount of coal it burns within the next decade, nothing anyone does to stabilize the climate will matter.""  As the article says, China's contribution to atmospheric CO2 is now over 10 billion metric tons a year, and 25 years of climate negotiations have failed utterly. But Goodell's article did not have to lead with the negative. He could have highlighted that China is now the largest consumer of solar power and that this year, 60 percent of its new energy production was from renewable energy sources, even higher than the U.S. at 53.8 percent. That it's making every effort to close coal plants. Or that even in the face of beatings or worse, its citizens are still rioting in the streets against fossil fuel production.  Iconic graphic designer Milton Glaser, creator of the ""I Love New York"" logo, developed a climate change branding campaign with buttons and billboards that feature a black circle fading to a small green strip at its bottom edge over the slogan ""IT'S NOT WARMING. IT'S DYING."" Position this message against one of the current denier billboards that proclaims ""'Green' Climate Policies: Probably unnecessary. Certainly ineffectual. Ruinously expensive."" Which one sounds more rationale? More persuasive? Easier to adopt? Commenting for Fast Company, Adele Peters questions Glazer's negative approach but remains hopeful that he's tackled the challenge. Her closing thought is absolutely correct: ""We need more brilliant designers and marketers tackling the messaging about climate change in different ways-especially in the U.S., which leads the world in climate denial.""

The report suggests that the first end-of-life conversation could coincide with a cherished American milestone: getting a driver's license at 16, the first time a person weighs what it means to be an organ donor. Follow-up conversations with a counselor, nurse or social worker should come at other points early in life, such as turning 18 or getting married. The idea, according to the IOM, is to “help normalize the advance care planning process by starting it early, to identify a health care agent, and to obtain guidance in the event of a rare catastrophic event.""The 21-member IOM committee that authored the report grappled with the fact that most Americans have not documented their wishes for end-of-life care. A national survey in 2013 found that 90 percent of Americans believed it was important to have end-of-life care discussions with their families, yet less than 30 percent had done so. Those who have had the discussions tend to be white, higher-income, over 65, and have one or more chronic condition.In response to these statistics, the IOM offers a new “life-cycle model of advance care planning” that envisions people having regular planning conversations as part of their primary care, and at the diagnosis of any chronic illnesses or genetic conditions. The conversation would continue at various turning points of a disease, when spiritual counseling might be offered, and then again in the final year of expected life.The report also found that the American health care system is poorly equipped to care for patients at the end of life. Despite efforts to improve access to hospice and palliative care over the past decade, the committee identified major gaps, including a shortage of doctors proficient in palliative care, reluctance among providers to have direct and honest conversations about end-of-life issues, and inadequate financial and organizational support for the needs of ailing and dying patients.Just talking about death and dying can ignite fear and controversy: Five years ago, the health law’s proposal for Medicare to reimburse doctors for counseling patients about living wills and advance directives became a rallying cry for Republican opponents of the law who warned about so-called “death panels.” The reimbursement provision was removed from the Affordable Care Act before it passed.The IOM argues that the country cannot afford to wait any longer to have a less heated conversation, especially as the number of elderly Americans continues to grow with the aging of the baby boom generation.“At a time when public leaders hesitate to speak on a subject that is profoundly consequential for the health and well-being of all Americans, it is incumbent on others to examine the facts dispassionately, assess what can be done to make those final days better, and promote a reasoned and respectful public discourse on the subject,” write Dr. Victor Dzau and Dr. Harvey Fineberg, the current and former presidents of the IOM in a forward.The report also addresses how to make palliative care – care that focuses on quality of life and pain control for people with serious illnesses – more prevalent and available to all patients.Over the past decade, palliative medicine has become a widespread specialty. But while 85 percent of hospitals with more than 300 beds now have palliative care services, many patients still may not have access to a specialist, including those who are not hospitalized or who live in rural areas. To address the shortage, the committee writes, all clinicians regardless of specialty “should be competent in basic palliative care, including communication skills, interprofessional collaboration, and symptom management.” Medical schools are currently required to cover end-of-life care as part of their curriculum, but they offer an average of just 17 hours of training over all four years. And end-of-life care is not one of the crucial 15 topic areas for Step 3 of the medical licensing exams, the final step to becoming a practicing physician.The committee calls for medical schools, accrediting boards and state regulatory agencies to bolster their end-of-life training and certification requirements.The IOM is an influential body that is the health arm of the National Academy of Sciences. Its mandate is to provide objective information to advise the public and policy makers. IOM reports are sometimes undertaken at the request of Congress, which can also fund the work. “Dying in America” was funded privately, however, by “a public-spirited donor” who wishes to remain anonymous, according to Dzau and Fineberg.This article was produced by Kaiser Health News with support from The SCAN Foundation.Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the Henry J.

While this is a large amount in absolute terms it is much smaller than deficits in recent years. This relative dearth of red ink has led Paul Krugman to crow, ""Bad news for Dr. Evil fans: the days of a ONE TRILLION DOLLAR deficit are over. In fact, the deficit is falling fast.""However, much of the improvement in the U.S. budget deficit was caused by Federal Reserve policies of quantitative easing and low interest rates. If the budget deficit is low because of monetary manipulations, is the improvement real and sustainable?""If the budget deficit is low because of monetary manipulations, is the improvement real and sustainable?""One way the Fed could decrease the budget deficit would be by adding jobs and having those newly employed people stop receiving government support and start paying taxes. But even if Federal Reserve policies did not create a single job, the central bank may still have cut this year's budget deficit almost in half. More on that calculation in a moment.If the Federal Reserve did dramatically decrease the budget deficit, is it a free lunch? ""There's No Such Thing as a Free Lunch"" is a conceptual cornerstone of economics, with Nobel Laureate Milton Friedman writing a book of the same title. Professor Friedman died in 2006, but YouTube has an almost hour-long talk of his arguing against the existence of free lunches.So who is right, Janet Yellen or Milton Friedman?Let us consider the possibility of a monetary free lunch in two parts. First, how did the Fed decrease the U.S. budget deficit so dramatically? And, second, is the Fed really serving up a free lunch?Let us begin by investigating how the Fed has dramatically cut the U.S. budget deficit. Fed policies, independent of employment effects, reduce the deficit in two ways.First, the Fed now owns trillions of dollars of Treasury bonds. The interest paid on those bonds is sent from the U.S. Treasury to the Fed, and then the Fed sends them back to the Treasury. The Fed also owns trillions in mortgage bonds and some of the interest on those bonds is sent to the Treasury too.Second, the government may be paying a lot less in interest because of Fed policies. Indeed, quantitative easing is designed to lower interest rates. The stated goal of the Fed's efforts to keep rates low is to help private sector borrowers, such as home buyers who want mortgages. Low mortgage rates lead to high home prices, which lead to more new homes built, which finally, leads to more jobs for people who build homes.However, low rates help all borrowers reduce their interest payments, and the U.S. Treasury is by far the largest borrower in America.Let us measure the impact of these two channels. Last year, the Fed sent $77.7 billion back to the Treasury. The Fed spent about $4 billion dollars on salaries, facilities and other expenses. Against these costs, the Fed ""earned"" about $82 billion. The $82 billion is interest on the bonds that the Fed has purchased by quantitative easing. (To paraphrase pop music, ""Get your money for nothing and your checks for free."")This year the Fed will likely send even more money to the Treasury because the Fed's bond pile is much larger than it was a year ago. Furthermore, while interest rates are still low, they have risen about one percentage point from their 2012 lows. Thus, this year the Fed will earn more interest on its swelling quantitative-easing treasure trove than last year.If the Fed sends $90 billion to the Treasury this year, it will be $53 billion more than the Fed sent in 2007; the last year before it began quantitative easing. So, let us count $53 billion in extra money sent by the Fed to the Treasury because of quantitative easing.The second, and much larger, reason that the Fed has cut the budget deficit is low interest rates. In 2007, the U.S. government had a total of $4.8 trillion dollars of debt in the hands of the public. On this $4.8 trillion in debt, the U.S. government paid an average interest rate of 4.9 percent for a total of $237.1 billion in interest payments.Because of enormous budget deficits, the amount of U.S. government debt in public hands has now risen to $11.9 trillion. However, interest rates are much lower now than they were in 2007. In spite of nearly tripling its debt, the U.S. government is paying less interest now than it did in 2007. If the government instead had to pay the same 4.9 percent rate as it did in 2007, the interest cost would have been $356 billion higher this year.Without the Fed's unusual policies, Dr. Evil fans would still be taunting Paul Krugman instead of vice versa.Did the Fed really reduce the budget deficit by $409 billion?A precise calculation requires knowing what interest rates would have been without Fed intervention. Perhaps the $409 billion overstates the impact of Fed policies because interest rates are low all over the world now. If the U.S. would have paid less than a 4.9 percent interest rate even without Fed policies, the $409 billion figure overstates the impact.On the other hand, perhaps the impact of Fed policy is even more than $409 billion. In a previous post, I noted that the government is on an historic ""spending spree that has increased total government debt by almost $10 trillion in a decade -- more in the last decade than in the entire prior history of the U.S."" Without quantitative easing, perhaps interest rates would have been higher than 4.9 percent to induce extra buyers to own all these extra government bonds.Even if we cannot know for sure what interest rates would be without unusual Fed policies, we can observe that the current 10-year Treasury yield of 2.6 percent is very low. One reason for these low rates might be the Fed purchases under quantitative easing.The magnitude of quantitative easing is staggering. In fact, the Fed has monetized 40 percent of the cumulative new issuance of federal debt since 2007. ""Monetized"" means that the Fed has created new money by waving its electronic wand, and used that new money to buy Treasury and mortgage bonds.Since 2007, the Federal government has issued $8.7 trillion in additional debt and the Fed has monetized an additional $3.5 trillion by creating new money.In the last two years, the Fed has monetized 96 percent of new U.S. debt. Over the last two years, the government has increased debt by $1.68 trillion and the Fed has created $1.62 trillion in new money. Graph courtesy of the authorNow consider that the Fed may actually have a positive impact on the economy beyond financial engineering and financial repression. Perhaps the Fed is actually responsible for some of the jobs that have been created since 2007. Under this decidedly non-Austrian view, the Fed creates money, it uses that money to buy U.S. government debt, and monetary policy provides the lubrication for stimulative fiscal policy as well.So here is the potential free lunch. The government overspends by trillions and the Fed pays for the expenditures with newly created money. Actually, the lunch is better than free, as it saved the U.S. government more than $400 billion this year alone.This raises two questions. First, if the lunch is free, why close the restaurant? Second, can the road to non-serfdom really be paved with electronic dollars?The Fed is planning to end additional new purchases of bonds at its October 2014 meeting -- just next month. Why end the free lunch?""The beauty of creating money for nothing is there is no limit to how much the Fed can create.""Rather, why not increase the scale of quantitative easing by, for example, monetizing the remaining $11.9 trillion of public U.S. debt. In fact, why stop there, why not buy up all the U.S. government debt and some trillions of other assets -- stocks, private bonds, real estate and more. With an even larger investment pile, the Fed could send hundreds of billions of dollars in proceeds every year to the U.S. government. The beauty of creating money for nothing is there is no limit to how much the Fed can create.But one reason not to monetize on a larger scale might be that there would be costs to greater monetization. Perhaps like goldilocks and Arthur Laffer in his eponymous tax curve, the Fed has found the optimal amount of monetary creation. Yes, $4 trillion is great, but an extra $12 trillion to remove all federal debt would be too much.And yet, the proponents of current Fed policies mention no large costs to monetization, so one wonders why they would stop now.It comes down to whether the monetization lunch is actually free. Are there hidden costs in the economy today, or, alternatively, will the economy crash in the future because of these Fed actions?The uncomfortable truth is that no one knows the total impact of current Fed policies. The tax-and-spend policies of the 1970s have been repudiated; Instead, we are running a giant print-and-spend experiment with our lives, and those of our children and grandchildren.""There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.""While no one knows what will happen, I think Milton Friedman is right. There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.Therefore, I continue to believe that this grand Keynesian experiment will end in tears. Furthermore, when it ends badly, future generations will not be able to believe our stupidity. They will ask, ""So your plan to solve the problem of overspending and too much debt was to have the Fed create a lot of money to enable much greater amounts of overspending and debt accumulation? Who was running the asylum, the evil doctors or the patients?""For more about how the Federal Open Market Committee will reach their policy decision Wednesday, watch Paul's simulation of a committee meeting from March 1994.Terry Burnham is a regular contributor to Making Sen$e with Paul Solman at the PBS NewsHour Online, where this post originally appeared.Catch up on past articles by Terry:Is Your Money Safe at the Bank?

Begin The Countdown to Bedtime warnings at 15 minute intervals, at least two hours before you actually want them in bed.2. Tell them 10 times each to use the toilet, wash their hands and faces, brush teeth, get PJs on.3. Threaten to cancel/throw away something -- anything -- fun if they don't get in the bathroom RIGHT NOW to use the toilet, wash their hands and faces, brush teeth, get PJs on.4. While they paint the bathroom in toothpaste and spit, search house for the cherished toys they MUST have in bed in order to sleep, for it is guaranteed each one has been removed from the sacred spots in their bedrooms and are in different corners of different floors of the house.5. Herd kids to their bedrooms.6. Watch kids jump on the beds, playing a risky game of Dangerously Uncoordinated at Nighttime Chase.7. Tell them to JUST CALM DOWN FOR THE LOVE OF ALL THAT IS DECENT in the voice that makes the I'm Serious vein bulge in your neck.8. Hustle the kids into Big Kid's room.9. Listen to Big Kid read a book while batting away Little Kid's constant interruptions with a number of eyebrow-centric threatening looks of deflection.10. When done, tuck him in and watch Little Kid tackle Big Kid to kiss him good night, despite his protests, riling him up until he accidentally knocks Little Kid off the bed, who starts crying due to minor head injury that is probably fake.11. Physically remove Little Kid from the floor beneath Big Kid's bed.12. Blow kisses and I Love Yous to Big Kid, ignoring that he's pretending to wipe them off, then carry sobbing Little Kid under one arm while closing the door with the other.13. Go to Little Kid's room.14. Fantasize about long hot showers while she spends 14 minutes deciding between two boring and terrible books you both have memorized.15. Cram yourself into a tiny spot on the bed between a Pillow Pet and a stuffed bunny the size of a Great Dane to read a book in your Sweet Bedtime Voice while getting interrupted twice per page with random observations/questions about life in an attempt to delay the inevitable.16. Close the book and ask Little Kid to get under the covers.17. Feel the breeze as Little Kid dashes out of the room in a blur to the bathroom for a cup of water.18. Take deep, cleansing breaths as you hear the water splashing out of the tiny paper cup onto the hall floor as Little Kid walks back to her room.19. See Little Kid realize once she arrives in the bedroom doorway that all of her water is now gone, and intercept her attempt to get more water by getting it yerdamnself.20. Tuck her back into bed.21. Cover your ears when she starts her nightly sonic boom of squeals that you forgot to check all the night-lights, then walk around the bedroom with her behind you to closely confirm that each of the 17 night-lights are, in fact, in working order.22. Tell her to get back into bed in the required nest she created with pillows and various toys.23. Give kisses and hugs to her.24. Give kisses and hugs to various toys around her room.25. Shut off the light. (Finally.)26. Hear your name cried out the moment you close the door.27. Listen to her explain that she is pretty sure she forgot to kiss her other parent, then admit ""Oh yeah, right"" when you remind her that she already did so four times.28. Re-do the kisses and hugs to both her and her various toys.29. Close the door more quickly this time.30. When you are in the bathroom sitting on the toilet with the shower running, hear quiet knocking on the door.31.

Walk her back to her room wearing a towel and a look of hopelessness.33. Kindly point out that the nightlights are bright enough to give her a tan/she's been awake for 14 hours/the bear was next to her the whole time.34. Get her back in bed-nest.35. Trust your gut when she begins weeping that she really REALLY needs to poop RIGHT NOW.36. Follow her to the bathroom where she immediately poops something a carbo-loading lumberjack would be impressed with.37. Toss her back into bed (with love).38. As adoringly as possible (and through gritted teeth) say, ""I LOVE YOU GOODNIGHT"" and run the hell outta there.39. Gobble up the kisses she blows at you, blow some back, close the door one last time and enjoy the silence as she rolls over, satisfied that she has tortured you enough for one day.Originally published by Kim Bongiorno on Let Me Start by Saying.

And no, the whole shelves arent visible in this picture - there are 6 shelfes missing! I love books! And the bad thig is, I collect them more than I read. Read a lot in my teenage years but now I'm glad if I read one or two books a year. Theese are all my books, even childrens books cause I can't throw anything away!",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badff48260000e9008118d4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I was a child and things got hectic at home, I found sanctuary in the pages of a book (mostly British fantasy novels). The characters in those books never looked like me or lived a life like mine, but that was part of the appeal; books were mostly a way to escape my own reality, and over the years I became convinced that I needed to become a different person and live someplace else in order to be truly happy. As a young woman I acted on that belief and left Canada for a ""new and improved"" life in the US.Writing and teaching for 20 years in this country has taught me a lot about the fine line between fantasy and reality when it comes to matters of race, and this past summer has been a particular education. I had hoped to finish the final novel in my ""freaks & geeks"" trilogy, and spent a week in Dakar, Senegal conducting research. But when I got back to Brooklyn, events in the news left me at a loss for words. That's an uncomfortable feeling for a writer; we make sense of the world by telling stories so when the stories stop, the world becomes a very confusing place.  This summer I found myself wondering -- as I sat wordless before my laptop -- who would write a story for the children of Eric Garner, a Black man killed on July 17 by a white NYPD officer using a chokehold. If anyone did write a story about police brutality, what press would have the courage to publish it? And what about fantasy fiction -- could it offer traumatized Black youth a temporary escape from reality, or would it only render them invisible just as fantasy novels erased me as a child? Scholar Ramón Saldívar argues that a new generation of authors can ""reverse the usual course of fantasy, turning it away from... daydream, delusion, and denial"" in order to ""redeem, or perhaps even create, a new moral and social order.""* Do such books exist for Black youth?The pain and rage I felt over the August 9 police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, MO only heightened the frustration I feel whenever I think about inequality in the children's publishing industry. There's clearly a direct link between the misrepresentation of Black youth as inherently criminal and the justification given by those who brazenly take their lives. The publishing industry can't solve this problem, but the relative lack of children's books by and about people of color nonetheless functions as a kind of ""symbolic annihilation."" Despite the fact that the majority of school-age children in the US are now kids of color, the US publishing industry continues to produce books that overwhelmingly feature white children only. The message is clear: the lives of kids of color don't matter.  Illustration: Tina KuglerWhen artist Maya Gonzalez asked me to join her in making a statement about the crisis in Ferguson, I initially pulled back. I didn't think I could say anything encouraging or even coherent when all I felt was bitter betrayal (according to a Pew Research Center poll taken the week after the shooting, 47 percent of whites felt the issue of race in the Ferguson case was getting more attention than it deserved). Instead I dug up a decade-old picture book story I wrote about lynching and hired an artist to illustrate the book. I daydreamed about moving to London. I revisited Marita Bonner's 1925 essay ""On Being Young -- a Woman -- and Colored: You long to explode and hurt everything white; friendly; unfriendly. But you know that you cannot live with a chip on your shoulder even if you can manage a smile around your eyes -- without getting steely and brittle and losing the softness that makes you a woman.After a week had passed, I wrote Maya back and suggested we start a video campaign that would feature members of the children's literature (kid lit) community. Lots of people clamor for greater diversity in kid lit but remain silent whenever another Black teenager is shot down -- Ramarley, Trayvon, Jordan, Renisha, and now Michael Brown. They cling to the fantasy that white supremacy has shaped every US institution except the publishing industry. They look at the reality of racial dominance in children's literature and pretend that the innocence ascribed to white children extends equally to Black children. At a moment when 75 percent of whites have no minority friends, the need for diverse children's literature (which can foster cross-cultural understanding at an early age) is greater than ever.The Kid Lit Equality movement asks people to stand up and speak out about the ways our community serves -- or could better serve -- youth who are marginalized in our society and then under- and/or misrepresented in children's literature. Some of us are traditionally published authors and some of us have started our own presses in order to create a wider range of stories that reflect these kids' diverse realities. In the past year I have released seven books for young readers. These titles show the resilience of Black youth as they face various challenges -- divorce, bullying at school, gang violence, homelessness, the loss of a loved one. Yet they also feature a touch of magic -- a protective phoenix, a mirror that reveals one's ancestors, a boy encased in a glass bubble. Self-publishing these seven books still leaves me with 20 unpublished manuscripts and several works-in-progress. I haven't given up on traditional publishers but I don't have time to wait for them to do right by our kids. We need Kid Lit Equality now, but believing that it will come from within the publishing industry is a fantasy we just can't afford.*Ramón Saldívar, ""Historical Fantasy, Speculative Realism, and Postrace Aesthetics in Contemporary American Fiction,"" American Literary History, Volume 23, Number 3, Fall 2011 (574-599)."

The First World War, however, was the first conflict in which submarines were widely deployed and were they played a major role in shaping both the course and the final outcome of the conflict.German submarine deployment was focused primarily on the Atlantic and to a lesser extent the Mediterranean. The Atlantic, however, was the decisive theatre, principally the seas around the British Isles, the North Sea and the coast of France. What came to be called the Battle of the Atlantic pitted the German submarine fleet against the combined naval forces of Great Britain and France, and later those of the United States. At stake was Germany's attempt to cut off Great Britain from access to overseas sources of foodstuffs and raw materials and force her out of the war and later, to prevent American men and materials from joining the Allied war effort. The Allies successfully combated the German U-boat menace through a combination of tactics, such as conveys and aerial reconnaissance, and through new military technology, such as depth charges. An early version of sonar, or ASDIC as it was originally called, was developed in 1917, but was not deployed until after the war had ended. Despite these responses, Germany came perilously close to closing Britain's Atlantic lifeline. In the process German U-boats sank nearly half of Britain's merchant marine fleet, with considerable human losses.German firms like Krupp had been building U-boats for the German navy since before the war. By 1914 Germany had a total of 33 submarines, of which five were short-range defensive types and the rest highly effective long-range boats. With the German High Seas Fleet bottled up in its ports, Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz argued that the only effective way Germany had of enforcing its own blockade was the use of U-boats. With this decision, no hostile merchant vessel was safe from the scourge of the U-boats and unrestricted submarine warfare.Initially, the U-boat campaign was directed against the British Grand Fleet. Later, U-boats were directed against merchant shipping and the trade routes of the Entente Powers. Germany's policy of unrestricted submarine warfare proved to be a major factor in swaying American public opinion to enter the war on behalf of the Allies. On August 6, just two days after the British declaration of war, ten German U-boats sailed from their base in Heligoland in northwest Germany to attack Royal Navy warships in the North Sea. This was the first wartime submarine patrol in history. The patrol was unsuccessful. One U-boat, U-9, broke down and returned to port without seeing any action. U-15 was rammed by the British Light Cruiser HMS Birmingham and sliced in half. It promptly sank. A third, U-13, was reported missing and believed to have been sunk by a mine. While the patrol was unsuccessful, the greater range of operation exhibited by the patrol raised concerns at the Admiralty about the vulnerability of Royal Navy anchorages, at the same time, however, the Navy continued to discount the threat that submarines could pose to large surface vessels.German Submarine U-14They were soon to be dissuaded from this belief by a string of successful U-boat attacks. On September 5, U-21 torpedoed the Royal Navy light cruiser HMS Pathfinder. Two weeks later, U-9 found and sank three old armored cruisers: HMS Aboukir, HMS Cressy and HMS Hogue. Three weeks later, U-9 struck again sinking another old cruiser, HMS Hawke. The sinking of this many cruisers caused considerable alarm at the Admiralty and raised doubt about the security of the fleet's main anchorage in Scapa Flow. British war ships were immediately redeployed to ports in eastern Ireland and western Scotland until additional security measures could be installed at Scapa Flow. While the losses had been minor, they had succeeded in forcing one the world's most powerful naval fleets to temporarily abandon its home base. On November 23, despite the new precautions taken, U-18 was able to penetrate the defenses at Scapa Flow and enter the anchorage but found the fleet absent. It was subsequently spotted and eventually forced to surface and surrender. On the very last day of the year, U-24 sighted the British battleship HMS Formidable on maneuvers in the English Channel and sank her.The first attacks against merchant ships commenced in October 1914. On October 14, the British Merchant ship SS Glitra became the first British merchant vessel to be sunk by a German submarine. U-17 stopped and searched the vessel. In accordance with the prevailing rules, the crew was placed in lifeboats and then the seacocks were opened to sink the Glitra. U-17 never actually fired upon her. On October 20, less than a week later, U-24 became the first submarine to attack an unarmed merchant vessel without warning, torpedoing the steamship Admiral Ganteaume. The ship was carrying 2,500 Belgian refugees and the U-boat commander claimed he had mistaken her for a troopship. Fortunately it did not sink and was towed to the French port of Boulogne with minimal loss of life. On January 30, U-20 torpedoed and sank the steamers SS Ikaria, SS Tokomaru and SS Oriole without warning. Within 90 days of the onset of World War I it had already become evident that the submarine would play an important role in the conflict and that it would revolutionize the conduct of naval operations. Within a few months, the German government would announce a policy of ""Unrestricted Submarine Warfare"" and open a new chapter in the history of naval warfare."
20,ARTS,Crystal Bridges Exhibition Reveals Curatorial Missteps,"Blair Schulman, ContributorArt writer/critic",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/crystal-bridges-exhibitio_1_b_5815724.html,"Covering over 19,000 square feet of exhibition space, State of the Art: Discovering American Art Now at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas is an enormous undertaking that casts a wide net but misses the mark when it comes to the emergence of strong, definitive themes.",2014-09-16,2014-09-14-CrystalBridgesStateoftheArt1237crop.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-14-CrystalBridgesStateoftheArt1237crop-thumb.jpg,"Covering over 19,000 square feet of exhibition space, State of the Art: Discovering American Art Now at the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Arkansas is an enormous undertaking that casts a wide net but misses the mark when it comes to the emergence of strong, definitive themes. The exhibition runs September 13 - January 19, 2015.With 227 art works by 102 artists from most of the United States, there is a lot of ground to cover. The two-man curatorial team, President Don Bacigalupi and co-curator Chad Alligood, place an emphasis on traditional crafting and disciplines. As a way of perhaps preparing its audience for the exhaustive task of covering so much ground, the very first piece visitors encounter is Mom Booth, an interactive installation from Andy Ducett (Minnesota). A life-size booth staffed with volunteer mothers ready to dispense advice, along with tissues, chicken soup and other maternal comforts. It's cute, it's silly, but also sets a tone that there is going to be very little controversy within.Pockets of this exhibition depict how we as a nation have plenty of economic, environmental and social issues to deal with and the static ways in which we address them. In particularly, consider Works Progress' (Minnesota) Water Bar, a second interactive installation dispensing water tastings from three sources around the country. It was unclear to me if this is meant to illuminate our country's huge drought issues or our food porn obsessions and micro-analyzing of potables. Whereas Pam Longobardi's (Georgia) Ghosts of Consumption's use of debris culled from oceans around the world is more straightforward. Susie J. Lee's (Washington) Jake, Johnny, Young Trucker is a video triptych of men who work in the fracking industry. They are silent and hardly move at all, in fact. I see this as a strong statement that the work on this potentially enormous environmental catastrophe is moving forward with nary a word being said.There are two artists whom I would vote Best in Show. Vincent Valdez's (Texas) The Strangest Fruit presents chilling depictions of men known by Valdez illuminating the lynching of Latinos -- a metaphor for the persecution and oppression felt by contemporary Latinos in the United States. The ropes that bind the men are no longer visible and the subjects appear to be floating in an almost-embryonic state that is cold and clinical, making it all the more powerful. There is also a series of hand-crafted objects from Vanessa German (Pennsylvania). Made at her ARThouse from re-purposed items to engage the community in her Pittsburgh neighborhood, sculptural ""power figures"" act as talismans to protect the children of her neighborhood. Their craftsmanship and provenance are the essence of socially engaged arts activism.Other artists worth noting throughout the show include John Powers (Tennessee), James Lavadour (Oregon), Isabella Kirkland (California), Jeff Whetstone (North Carolina), Ghost of a Dream (New York), Julie Blackmon (Missouri), Mark Wagner (Pennsylvania), Gina Phillips (Louisiana) and Wilmer Wilson IV (Pennsylvania).  There is an impressive, almost dizzying, array of work on view. But relevant ideas that in a smaller exhibition would stand out are lost amongst the scale of this shows' inability to reconcile their placement. Choosing artists who, the curators revealed, were not yet fully exposed to ""the national art conversation"" leads one to believe their mission is an altruistic obligation that needed to be addressed and has become unraveled thanks to this show. It is left unclear, however, how exposure, or the lack of it, was determined. Some artists selected are already receiving regional and national press; three of them have gallery representation in New York City, so this preamble of being noninclusive is murky. What were the limits of maturity in one's practice? Gallery or exhibition exposure? Academic ideology? State of the Art: Discovering American Art Now offers an almost-encyclopedic presentation that fails to invite serious analysis and critique, not just of the art, but also of the exhibition makers and their justification for such a sweeping gesture. The sheer numbers of selected works are just far too large to not settle on a few strong topics in order to make a definitive statement. It needs to be more thematic. I would rather see this show broken out into a handful of smaller exhibitions over the course of a few years rather than this cannibalization of so many varying styles and processes thrown into one pot. Walking through gallery after gallery is too overwhelming to impart any substantive cohesion. Even a few ideas that encompass what American artists from myriad geographic locations are concerned with would have made a vast difference in reconciling everything on display.As Bacigalupi himself says in a catalog/gift box accompanying the show, this exhibition attempts to deliver us from, ""... the frustration at the prevailing idea of the American art world which focuses on art production in urban centers such as New York, Chicago and Los Angeles ..."" But I don't know if deliverance or the moralizing of such is even necessary. Yes, these cities are huge art markets and are likely to remain so for the time being. If there is an attempt to retreat from these centers, then the current strategy ought to be reconsidered. Consider Kansas City, Missouri, a place that supports artists alongside its cultural institutions as one strong example of the changing tide. The curators, in words (paraphrased) by artist Glenn Ligon on another subject, remain ""burdened by the necessity to address this lack"" rather than focusing on stronger curatorial concepts. Let this institution make a statement by puzzling out what they've discovered and showing the public a more creative and less cryptic way to represent their work.All images courtesy EG Schempf"
