0,TRAVEL,Morocco Hits All the Right Notes for Travelers,"Edward Piegza, Contributor

Here, it's easy to get lost in ﬂavors, textures and moments so unexpected that they give you pause. What's more exotic -- and memorable -- than a vacation like that?",2014-01-30,"[UNVERIFIED CONTENT] A cat sleeping in a shop above Chouwara Tannery in Fes, Morocco. The Chouwara tannery is the largest and most famous of the tanneries in the medina.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dd33a2000003100fe1c95.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The gentle, all-night hiss of the shifting Sahara sand subsided. Pinholes of pale pink light ﬁltered into my Berber tent. Well-rested after yesterday's camel ride into camp and last night's banquet by the bonﬁre, I didn't even mind that I was awake earlier than usual. I threw back the ﬂap. Ahead, the crest of a great red dune tapered down into the encampment, like a powder-soft ramp up to the sky. There was a quiet like I can't remember. The day started as a sharp rim of gold somewhere over Algeria, before the horizon melted away in the most amazing sunrise I have ever seen.I love to tell that story of my Moroccan morning whenever anyone asks my advice on the best exotic travel destination. I hear the question often because I'm the founder of a cultural travel company called Classic Journeys. Morocco hits all the right notes for travelers who want to step outside the norm without giving up the creature comforts they love. The culture is out of the ordinary for North American travelers, yet this peaceful Islamic kingdom is very accessible, with a terriﬁc tourism infrastructure that places an emphasis on luxury.Consider the medina of Fes, medieval with a labyrinth of 9,000 streets. ""Balek"" is the ﬁrst word I learned here, as it's the shouted signal for an approaching pack donkey laden with flowers or firewood or oranges. Arms spread, I could nearly touch both walls of many streets, and the donkeys have the right of way. In the medina, you see everything from vermilion and indigo vats of dye where leather is tanned in one-man workshops where coppersmiths tap out their wares. It's a little gritty and totally authentic. Best of all, it's all only a few minutes from grand hotels like the Soﬁtel Fès Palais Jamaï, the former palace of the Grand Vizier.Then there's what I call ""The Oasis Surprise."" You may have that mental image of two or three palm trees draped over a cool spring in a vast desert wasteland, but this isn't the case. Morocco's oases, which are easily accessible to visitors, extend for miles through fertile river valleys. The most scenic one squeezes into the 900-foot-deep Todra Gorge. Oases are great places to go for a walk. The paths are the tops of dikes; they separate small plots lush with grain or flowers that the local women and children farm by hand. Almond trees and date palms are here, too, with dangling bunches of ripening fruits. To thread your way through an oasis is like stepping back in time.Another sign that you're on a truly exotic vacation is when you are the most foreign creature around. One of the few times that has happened to me was in the Ourika Valley in Morocco's Atlas Mountains. I visited with my friend Saida, a former journalist and now a guide who hosts guests on our Classic Journeys. We took a winding hillside path through terraced ﬁelds to a tiny Berber hamlet. I was amazed by the instant, heartfelt hospitality, which I came to realize is a trait of Moroccans everywhere. As they poured me a cup of traditional mint tea, Saida summed up the scene: ""It's so rare to see a North American here that they're just thrilled to meet you!""By contrast, Marrakech thrives on tourism. Djemaa el-Fna Square is most certainly not your ""typical"" downtown. It's a non-stop carnival of snake charmers, monkey tamers, magicians and acrobats. Visit by all means -- it's an essential bit of the Marrakech experience. But there are more other-worldly experiences in-store. The city's souk is a raucous warren of alleys cheek-by-jowl with shops. Rugs and ceramic tiles, tribal jewelry and tinware, babouche slippers and mementos -- it's all here. With the lively haggling that is part of the process, it's shopping as competitive sport -- as much fun to watch as to participate.Did I mention the food? Couscous is the staple of the Moroccan diet. Tagines -- savory stews cooked inside conical earthenware pots -- are nearly as common. But high-end dining in Morocco is truly remarkable. I love Moulay Yacoutin Marrakech. Behind a humble door to the street, you enter a private mansion where a candlelit pool reflects a tranquil garden. Cocktails are on a rooftop terrace overlooking the shimmering city. In the private dining room, a procession of traditional dishes based on centuries-old recipes offer a decadent delight for even the most serious foodie.What I enjoy most about Morocco is that it comes with few of the pre-conceived notions we have about more familiar destinations. Here, it's easy to get lost in ﬂavors, textures and moments so unexpected that they give you pause. What's more exotic -- and memorable -- than a vacation like that?"

I hurried her to the ER. It was an infection. ""Serious,"" they said. We were brought by ambulance to a larger hospital. She was put on oxygen and I was told to wait. My husband stayed home with our 1-year-old. For three days, I held my baby, rocked her gently and struggled with her up to the top -- and back down to the bottom -- of every breath. Despite how painful it was for us both, I'll always be grateful for the chance I had to be so present with her.Then they sent us home. I was back in my kitchen, barely functional after a sleepless 72 hours. All the craziness I'd set aside came rushing back -- fear of my own incompetence, suffocating guilt, terrified disbelief -- thinking of the weeks, months and years of monotonous chaos I was in for. Meanwhile, I couldn't imagine getting through even one day. I picked up the phone and dialed a familiar number. ""Mom, please come. I need help."" My mother arrived the next morning.Despite my mother's presence, or maybe because of it, I ascended to new heights of mania and sank to new depths of depression. I now recognize these high highs and low lows as hallmarks of postpartum depression. One moment, frantic; the next, a zombie.I scoffed at my mother's well-meaning suggestions to take a shower, get out of the house or call a friend. I'm a personal trainer and I normally love a good workout, but the suggestion that I go lift weights made me want to put a brick through a window.Clear that she was getting nowhere but resolved to help, my mother tried a different approach. She tried to put my pain in perspective: ""When you were an infant, I was completely alone."" Guilt.She tried to help me see the bright side: ""Your babies are fundamentally healthy! You have a good home! A loving husband! A great life!"" Embarrassment. Days later, when all her efforts to bring me back had failed, she pulled out the big guns: ""Kelly,"" she said, all NYC-blue-collar-and-bootstraps, ""You need to snap out of it. Now. These babies need you."" She said it to be helpful, to deliver the magic bullet that would put me back on my feet. She was addressing her level-headed, rational, hard-working daughter, the one who had always responded well to tough love. But that person wasn't home. ""Enough already,"" she said, ""Quit the shit.""Devastation.It's hard to watch people we love suffer, especially our children. Often, and understandably, our instinct is to try to do or say something to make the pain stop. Unfortunately, postpartum depression (and clinical depression, with which I also have direct experience) is an inside job, and no kind suggestion, magic bullet or scare tactic was (or is) likely to fix it. Where sympathy and tough love fell short, I believe empathy would have helped: for my mother -- or anyone, for that matter -- to take the time to become conscious of what I was going through, and to be with me in that experience without trying to gloss over or fix or solve. For someone to say ""I feel your pain,"" instead of ""I'm sorry you're going through this. At least..."" or ""Why don't you...?"" Empathy is rare, maybe because it goes against so many of our habits; our tendency to judge (""What you're going through isn't that bad"") and our desire to fix what's broken (""You'd feel better if you got some sleep"") both have to be abandoned. Having empathy means lingering in feelings we'd just as soon forget. Guidelines that encourage empathetic connection -- non-judgment, listening in respectful silence, withholding advice and reacting only when the speaker is voicing your own truth -- are read at the beginning of every MotherWoman postpartum support group meeting. These guidelines make the meetings a safe place for mothers to speak the truth of their experience, a place where their truth can be respectfully held by other women who can relate. Holding and honoring one another's pain helps us all to heal.When I think back on my last postpartum period, it's without resentment. My mother was there when I needed her most. Motivated by love, she did what she thought was best. If I could go back in time, instead of dismissing her well-meaning suggestions, I would ask her to wrap me in her arms, to rock me gently, and to be with me in my pain. I imagine she would have been thrilled for the chance to bring me that level of comfort and to experience such a deep connection with her child. In her arms, I would have felt warm, safe, understood, and, most importantly, not alone. I would have heard her say, with a voice that sounds exactly like mine, ""I'm here. I'm in this with you, my baby. Thank you for letting me hold you.""Kelly Coffey is a formerly obese personal trainer and blogger living in Western Massachusetts.

We may not all have what it takes to be an Olympian, but a visit to an Olympic town gives us the chance to discover what it feels like to careen down a bobsled run, swoosh down the slopes, snap a photo with a gold-medal winner, or try a single salchow on an Olympic skating rink. Here are five places to catch Olympic fever this winter:Lake Placid, New York This charming hamlet in New York's Adirondacks has hosted two Winter Olympics, in 1932 and 1980, the latter best remembered for the ""Miracle on Ice"" U.S. victory in men's hockey against the Soviet Union. Unsurprisingly, this town proudly struts its Olympic heritage, offering a 1980 Games trivia scavenger hunt around town and a Winter Challenge competition. Get Your Olympics On: Several Olympic complexes and Whiteface Mountain offer a multitude of options, from bobsledding, skeleton, luge, Nordic and downhill skiing to ice skating and a biathlon experience. Lower-key options include toboggan rides on frozen Mirror Lake, gondola rides, snow tubing, and a visit to the Lake Placid Olympics Museum. Want to do it all? The Lake Placid Winter Passport is the most cost-effective way to feel the Olympics rush.(MORE: Find a kid-friendly hotel in Lake Placid.)Calgary, Alberta Nestled in the wilds of the Canadian Rockies, the 1988 Calgary Olympics is remembered for standouts like British ski jumper Eddie ""The Eagle"" Edwards and the Jamaican Bobsled team's embodiment of the Olympic spirit. Get Your Olympics On: Winsport's Canada Olympic Park is the premier sports site and offers bobsled rides, Nordic and downhill skiing, ice skating, and an upgraded half-pipe that's an exact replica of the one in Sochi. At the Olympic Oval, dubbed the ""fastest ice in the world,"" you can go ice skating or hang out in the Sochi Lounge, a community viewing area that will be open for the duration of the Sochi Olympics. Salt Lake City, Utah The 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City attracted the largest crowds in the history of the winter games. Twelve years later, the facilities serve as training centers for aspiring athletes and visitors alike. Get Your Olympics On:  Olympic Park offers guided tours of the Olympic venues, bobsled and skeleton sled rides, two museums, and a ride to top of the world's highest ski jumps. At the Olympic Oval, visitors can take curling lessons or go ice skating. Soldier Hollow, the busiest venue of the 2002 Olympics, offers an amateur biathlon experience, cross-country skiing, and 1,200-foot tubing lanes, the longest in Utah.(MORE: Find a kid-friendly hotel in Salt Lake City.)Squaw Valley, California (photo: Flickr/jordanfischer)The multi-colored rings announce that you're in Olympic territory before you ever reach the slopes near Lake Tahoe. The 1960 Winter Olympics host has a tradition of cheering on local heroes that groomed their talent at Squaw Valley. Get Your Olympics On: You can go ice skating at the Olympic Ice Pavilion and visit the newly renovated mountain-side Olympic Museum. For a special treat, try a cookie at Wildflour Baking Company--a nostalgic favorite for Olympians who took their ""cookie breaks"" here as kids during ski school.Whistler, British Columbia Vancouver may have been the official host city of the 2010 Winter Olympics, yet over half of the medal events were held at the ski resort town of Whistler. The giant Inuksuit human-like sculptures carved by Canada's native Inuits still stand guard as a lasting symbol of the Olympics in Whistler. Get Your Olympics On: At Whistler Olympic Plaza, where medal ceremonies took place, there is an ice skating rink and family nights on Mondays and Wednesdays. Whistler Sliding Centre on Blackcomb Mountain offers skeleton and bobsled rides, while Whistler Olympic Park offers an array of Nordic events such as cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and a biathlon experience. For the ultimate Olympic fan, Whistler Blackcomb offers a ""Ski with an Olympian"" full-day experience.--Kristi Marcelle, a California based-freelance writer, contributed this to MiniTime.com."

China, home to 350 million smokers, announced Monday it would ban smoking on public transport and in all indoor workplaces as part of plans for a tobacco-free 2008 Beijing Olympics. The move came before World No Tobacco Day May 31. (AP Photo/EyePress) ** CHINA OUT **",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dd2f9240000310053bce4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BEIJING, Jan 29 (Reuters) - China has banned smoking in schools, state media reported on Wednesday, the latest step in a government drive to kick the country's pervasive tobacco habit.Despite years of campaigning by health activists, China is the world's largest consumer of cigarettes and smokers can be spotted everywhere, even in schools and hospitals.But with a huge public health burden looming ever larger, China has recently intensified efforts to stamp out smoking.The State Council, or cabinet, is aiming for a nationwide ban on smoking in public places this year, and several cities have already introduced anti-smoking regulations.But critics say authorities only enforce bans sporadically, if at all, and it is common to see people puffing away in front of no smoking signs.The latest ban, imposed by the Ministry of Education, covers kindergartens, elementary and middle schools, and vocational schools. Universities must set up smoking areas and forbid lighting up in academic buildings.Anti-tobacco efforts have been hampered by the country's powerful tobacco monopoly, health campaigners say, which pays hundreds of billions of yuan in taxes every year.Critics say another problem is that it is not clear who is responsible for punishing violators of cigarette bans, meaning officials often just turn a blind eye.Schools can no longer seek sponsorship from cigarette brands or post tobacco advertisements on campus, the ministry said in a notice.School principals must enforce the ban by installing smoke alarms or surveillance cameras to spot offenders. School canteens must also stop selling tobacco.Schools that do not crack down properly will be punished, the ministry said.As part of the battle against smoking, the government had earlier urged Communist Party cadres and government officials to stop smoking in schools, workplaces, stadiums, and on public transport and elsewhere to set a good example.
