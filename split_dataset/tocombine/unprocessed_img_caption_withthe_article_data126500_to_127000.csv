Veteran Travel Writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/been-there-dune-that_us_5b9deb84e4b03a1dcc8ec344,"It's a scene right out of Lawrence of Arabia: enormous mountains of sand -- some as tall as 300 feet -- their surface sculpted into soft, geometric designs by the wind, and  extending as far as the eye can see.",2014-03-11,2014-03-11-AnotherviewofHuacachinaoasisinthemorningsun.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-03-11-AnotherviewofHuacachinaoasisinthemorningsun-thumb.JPG,"Looking for something a little different and a lot off the beaten track this summer? Try sandboarding in the Peruvian dessert. It's a scene right out of Lawrence of Arabia: enormous mountains of sand -- some as tall as 300 feet -- their surface sculpted into soft, geometric designs by the wind, and extending as far as the eye can see. My wife and I stand captivated, feeling the heat of the day rising up out of the soft sand and watching the interplay of golden light and pale shadow as the sun dips behind a distant ridge of solid beige. Of course, there were also a few differences. For starters, this is not the great Sahara Desert, but the northernmost stretches of the even longer, but not as wide, Atacama Desert in southern Peru. And when it is time to return to our oasis, we climb not back onto camels, but into equally curiously-shaped, 10-passenger dune buggies. Nor will it be a leisurely plod back, but a wild ride up -- and especially down - a Bedouin's dozen more dunes, our hands clenched tightly to the cushioned bars in front of us and screams of delight issuing involuntarily from the mouths of our internationally-diverse fellow passengers. Peter O'Tooles we definitely weren't. For nearly two weeks, Huacachina had been dangled as a reward to our twin daughters for all the ""ordeals"" we had subjected them to: eight hours wandering the ruins of Machu Picchu, a day-long boat trip across Lake Titicaca, and a 15-hour minivan tour of the amazingly deep (11,000-feet) Colca Canyon. After a second overnight bus ride, they had certainly earned it. And we all needed to end our trip on a piercing high note. Naturally I was worried that Huacachina wouldn't be anywhere near as compelling as it looked in the guide books. Fortunately, I was wrong. Towering dunes of beach-quality sand encircle the palm, jacaranda and bougainvillea-laden oasis on three sides. The fourth, through which the road to Ica (three miles distant) passes is small by comparison, but still sufficient to block the view and create the impression of complete isolation. What little there is of the town wraps itself around three sides of a murky green lagoon of mythical origins (the name means ""crying woman"" in Quechua) whose allegedly curative waters once attracted ailing Peruvian elites.  These days, however, it's Huacachina's sand that's attracting thrill-seeking foreigners. While the girls cool off in the pool, I set off to arrange our afternoon dune buggy/sandboarding excursion. In fact, there wasn't much arranging to do. Just about every accommodation in town will do it for you, and it's all the same tour anyway. All you have to do is negotiate your price downwards from the asking price, which in December was only 30 soles ($12). At 4:00 p.m., our driver, Francisco, swings by our hotel in his neon orange buggy, a racked, open-air contraption that rumbles with power. Two hotels later, we are full. Francisco loops around to the other side of town where we pay our nominal municipal tax, and wait, engines throbbing, until the full caravan of dune buggies -- about 20 of them -- has assembled. Then, in an explosion of noise, color and palpable excitement, we roar off into the desert. For the next 30 minutes, Francisco delivers big-time on the ""adrenaline-stirring"" promise of the tour, tearing up, down and over a succession of serious sand as we in the back brace ourselves as best we can as we are jostled every which way. Finally, after one particularly rollicking and well-received descent, he stops at the top of a small dune so that we can try our luck at sandboarding.  Like snowboarding, sandboarding requires strapping your shoes into set grips atop a three-foot, wooden board. Then all you have to do is maintain your balance while gravity does the work. Needless-to-say, this is easier said than done, so first-timers like us appreciated the option of taking the first two runs on our stomachs with our legs splayed out behind to use as brakes. By now we are ready to try standing up, and with fairly satisfactory results -- surfing straight down for about 20 or 30 yards until friction arrested our momentum and we toppled over. From there, we are driven to a series of increasingly steeper dunes, with increasingly less innocuous results, including some rather unpleasant face-plants. By the time we arrive at our last run of the day -- a black diamond to be sure -- not even the two accomplished Korean snowboarders in our group are willing to take it any way but lying down. Our legs tired from trudging, our egos bruised from the falls, and our clothes infused with thousands of grainy souvenirs, we gladly relax to watch the sunset. And no one is more glad than I that Huacachina has been such a big hit -- a sand blast, in fact -- with another round of thrills still to come. By the time we are dropped off at our hotel, we have two very happy campers -- and two contented parents looking forward to a cold beer and an exceedingly atmospheric night at a real oasis. Going to Huacachina Getting there: Huacachina is located three miles southwest of Ica, which is roughly 175 miles south of Lima via the Pan-American Highway. Bus fares from Lima to Ica range from to $10-$30 with the trip taking 4-6 hours. From Ica, the set taxi fare is 7 soles ($3). Information: www.huacachina.comMarshall S.

But we've done enough work to realize that a cancerous cell has more than one mutation.",2014-03-11,Craig Bowron MD FACP - I'm a physician and writer on the North Coast,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/577e90a61b00001c00f6c895.jpg?ops=100_100,"The ""Swedish Bikini Team"" concept somehow managed to bring notoriety to Swedish bust lines, but finally, Swedish (and Finnish, and Icelandic) prostate glands are in the headlines. The medical headlines at least.The most recent New England Journal of Medicine includes updated results of a long-running prostate cancer study headquartered out of Uppsala, Sweden.From 1989 to 1999, the Scandinavian Prostate Cancer Study Group enrolled about 700 men with localized prostate cancer; half of the group had their prostates surgically removed, and half were simply watched. (That's not a crazy idea -- prostate cancer is common in older men, and typically grows slowly. Many men will die of something else years down the line, so the question is still hotly debated: Who will benefit from surgery, and who will only be hobbled by it?)Because the study pre-dated the use of prostate-specific antigen (P.S.A.), a blood test now commonly used to screen for cancer, 88 percent of the Scandinavian men in this study had tumors large enough to be felt with a physician's finger, in the way that Chevy Chase immortalized in the movie ""Fletch."" Only 5.2 percent had their cancer detected by screening, whereas in the U.S., less than 50 percent of men with newly-diagnosed prostate cancer have palpable tumors, and screening with PSA identifies most cancers. And so the direct applicability of this Scandinavian study to current practice has never been clear.The results look like this: 18 years later, 200 of the roughly 350 men in the surgery group had died, 63 of them from prostate cancer. In the watchful waiting group, 247 men had died, 99 of them due to prostate cancer. Surgery reduced the risk of dying from any cause from 69 percent to 56 percent, an almost 30 percent reduction. The benefit was strongest in those who underwent surgery at less than 65 years of age.If dying from prostate cancer, rather than any other particular cause, is somehow your foremost concern, the numbers look like this: 18 years later, 18 percent of those who underwent prostate surgery still died of prostate cancer. (Not surprisingly, the more aggressive the cancer appeared under the microscope, the more likely it was to return, even with surgery. In other words, it had already moved out of the prostate on some microscopic level at the time of surgery.) This compares to prostate cancer death rates of 29 percent in those who did not get surgery. Again, the benefit seemed to come mostly from treating men under age 65 with surgery.Interestingly, of the men found to have low-risk, seemingly unaggressive prostate cancer, 10 percent still eventually died of it even with surgery, even when we removed the entire prostate gland (compared with 14 percent with low-risk cancer who didn't get surgery). The difference between the two numbers was not statistically significant, i.e., surgery didn't seem to offer any benefit to these men. This finding demonstrates a couple of important points:We're not as good as we'd like to be at detecting whether some of the cancer has, on a microscopic level at least, exited the prostate gland. Patients are screened with blood work and CT scans prior to surgery, and if there is any evidence of spread, the surgery is cancelled. But we still can't see on a cellular level. Sometimes when we think we got it all, we didn't.And we're not as good as we'd like to be at predicting how cancerous prostate cells will behave in the future. Our current system, where we look at the tissue under a microscope and grade it for ""warped-ness,"" for how twisted or malignant it appears, is still one moment in time -- the present.But we're interested in the future, and the longer a cancerous prostate gland sits around, the longer it has to develop new genetic mutations that might make it more aggressive.In his Pulitzer Prize-winning book ""The Emperor of All Maladies,"" oncologist Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee chronicles the long history of our so-called ""War on Cancer."" Mukherjee points out that for all our sophistication, our current view of tumors in terms of size, microscopic appearance, and anatomical spread misses where the real action is: at the genetic level. If war is about understanding your opponent, we are only just beginning to understand the genetic changes that truly define the behavior and malignant potential of a cancerous cell. But we've done enough work to realize that a cancerous cell has more than one mutation. For example, an individual breast or colon cancer can have as many as 50 to 80 gene mutations, but a smaller number of those, perhaps 10, directly contribute to the cancerous behavior of the cells. And we don't understand which of those mutations are the freak cards, the ones that will allow the tumor to pick up and exit the prostate, or to replicate more rapidly. Let's hope that when these Scandinavian researchers take a look at how the study participants are doing in another three years, we'll have more precise and sophisticated ways of understanding which cancerous prostates need to go, and when."

You can also choose up to two proteins for no extra cost, but you'll pay for the more expensive protein.There's no extra cost for fajita veggies when you order a protein, so you might as well add them to increase the nutrients in your meal.Fresh CilantroA little-known Chipotle fact: you can get fresh cilantro and freshly chopped jalapeños added to any item, at no extra charge.The QuesaritoA Quesarito is a burrito-quesadilla hybrid: first, the tortilla is loaded with cheese, folded and pressed in the tortilla warmer. Then, they open up the quesadilla and pile it with your choice of fillings. The whole thing is rolled up like a burrito. If your Chipotle server isn't aware of the Quesarito, just tell them to use a quesadilla as the shell for your burrito.The BurritodillaThe Burritodilla is a smaller version of the Quesarito that looks more like a quesadilla and contains fewer fillings than a burrito. The burrito fillings and cheese are layered on a tortilla then warmed to perfection. If your server doesn't know about the Burritodilla, ask them to make a quesadilla but add about half the usual amount of burrito fillings.Find 4 more Chipotle hacks here.

Don't feel bad. Unless you're a professional car salesman, there's very little you could have done. It's hard to buy a car.Before I met my partner, mentor and now friend, Daymond John on ABC's Shark Tank, I was a car salesman. A really good one in fact. Most people know that I love sales, it's what I do. I loved selling cars, it was fun and easy. To this day I get asked by my past customers, new associates, followers and fans, ""How do I make sure I get a good deal on my new car?""Getting a good deal is more than just price, especially when you are buying a preowned car, even if it's under warranty its good to know what you are negotiating over. Here's a list I would hand out to my customers before they bought a car with me. It was a straightforward fact-finding way to help my customers fill their needs and help them. I love all my customers, most salespeople chase money, while it motivates me, it was never what I chased. I chased success, the money usually followed. Being upfront with a customer is the best way to insure that you have done your duty to them and to your employer who will also appreciate the loyalty to his dealership that you are building. Unfortunately you have to assume that most car salespeople do not understand the 10 commandments of selling.It's unlikely your salesperson will hand you a list like this ever, so take it with you and check off the questions as you are sufficiently answered, the more info the better. Some of these questions will not be applicable to your specific situation but most of them will. Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: The secrets to buying a car the right way are at your fingertips.1. Is the vehicle 4 Wheel Drive? if so does it work properly?2. Do you have a clean Carfax?3. Has it ever been repainted?4. Are there any signs of smoking or pets?5. Do all the windows and locks work?6. Do all of the lights, wipers and stereo work?7. Do the turn signals and cruise control work?8. Do you have the clear title in hand?9. If it hasn't already, will the car pass safety and emissions?10. how many keys and remotes are included with the car?11. Does the car have a spare tire and jack? 12. How about a gas cap?13. Ask about rust perforation/ pitting/ rock chips. many cars in inclement areas suffer from this.14. Hows the condition of glass, it may not have cracks, but are there chips that will become cracks?15. Are the roof rack components, interior organizing nets and other factory equipment all in tact and included?16. How about a cigarette lighter, cup holder and interior? Are they complete and clean?17. Do the rear defrost and heating elements work?18. Is the catalytic converter and exhaust system intact?19. Does the vehicle leak any fluids such as oil, antifreeze or any other essential fluid?20. How about the tread on tires and wear on brakes?21. Finally, are there any dealer documentary fees or other dealer specific fees that I should know about before I begin my negotiation?I now train sales people all over the country and its fun to prepare them for the new informed customer of today, the old way of selling is dead. You are not a mile from your nearest competitor, you are an inch away down the screen.After the deal is done and you're about to take delivery of your newly acquired vehicle, your salesperson may confesses to you that they have never had such a long list of questions to answer, don't be surprised, just tell them you are a student of The Nate State of Mind."

But it worked for him. Perhaps you know someone with a similar story. Or perhaps it's your own! If so, please share in the comments section below.I asked Brooks if I could interview him and send it to The Huffington Post and his response was ""Awesome.""Not only is Brooks a close friend and a great guy, but he's a true go-getter and a think-outside-the-box kind of guy. He also happens to be a real estate agent. You can visit his website at BrooksConkle.com.JRL: So let's hear the scoop, Brooks. Brooks: One of my life list items was to get married to a beautiful woman (both inside and out). It happened. So, I've been married about 2 months and it's still blowing my mind. Over the last few years I've realized that I'm just not good at being like everyone else (see one of my favorite books, the Art of Non-Conformity). That it's ok to not do things the way that others do. That nothing is perfect. That you learn as you go and correct along the way.JRL: How did you do it different?Brooks: So you know where I live, folks date. After they've dated for some pre-determined amount of time and they still like each other, they get engaged. I've been told figures about how much a man is supposed to spend on a wedding ring (I choked on my sandwich the first time I heard). Then they start planning on the wedding. Typically the female has dreamed of this moment but sometimes the man is just as excited (often times, he just wants to please his future bride). Then the marriage.I've been to a lot of friends' weddings. And they're beautiful. But they always seem so dang stressful. The bride and groom want everything to go perfectly on this one perfect day. They have lots of people to say hello to and they're whisked from place to place (my buddy that recently got married joked that he had calculated that he had 2 minutes and 40 seconds to speak with each guest that came up to say hello).None of the above fit my personality and apparently not my wife either (which I assume is one of the reasons why we're married!)What's a ""perfect"" wedding day for anyway? Don't you have each day to wake up and attempt to be the best you can for each other? Why is the day you get married supposed to be the most important? Why not EVERY day? Wouldn't it be incredible if we treated the 100th and 1,000th day with our spouse the same as the 1st? Ok, so I said that I wouldn't have guessed this is how it would have ended up for me.Here are a few of my wedding's fun facts:My step-son (he now calls me Dad2!) was snacking on a banana during our ceremony. It was awesome!The only people present at our ceremony was God, the court pastor, my wife, myself, and our son.Rings weren't even yet present for the ceremony.We didn't know 100 percent that we were able to be married until the day of our ceremony. JRL: How did your family react to that?Brooks: We told our families first, but friends have slowly come to learn of our unity. We get two main reactions: ""I had no idea you guys were getting married!"" We say, ""We really didn't either!"" Others say, ""I didn't even know that you guys were engaged!"" And we say, ""We skipped that part!""JRL: How do you respond when people ask why you chose an unconventional path to marriage? Brooks: I just say, ""Why Not?"" Over the course of the past year that we dated, we discussed everything that you would need to know about a marriage partner -- life goals, spiritual ideas, finances, which way the toilet paper roll should be installed, etc. We looked at getting pre-marital counseling, but we wondered what in the world that they could tell us that we didn't already know about each other? We had asked countless folks, learned from other's experiences, read books, etc.The only real thing that was holding me back was FEAR. Fear of ""if I could do it."" Fear of ""will she love me if she sees what I'm like every day"" Fear of ""settling down."" Fear of ""children."" Fear of ""fear."" -- yep it started getting ridiculous. So I finally said, ""What else do we have to figure out? What are we waiting for? Let's do this."" My woman happily moved forward (she knew all along that we would be an incredible team and was patiently waiting for me to get off of the fence that I ride -- yet another incredible reason why I love her). But of course we wanted to find a way to include all family and additional loved ones.So we're in the process of planning a reception celebration. At a barn? Shrimp Boil? Human Sized Banana Split? Art painted by guests? Signature Conkle-lotta Cocktails? Wii Dance Contest? Bonfire? Hot Dog Roasting and Smores? Inflatable Games? Yes, our reception will clearly be unconventional as well.But it's our reception. We're not living our lives the way we're ""supposed to."" It's a time for us to celebrate and we want to express that in a way that makes us feel comfortable. So live your unconventional life. Do what makes you happy. Do what makes you come alive. Because what the world is begging for is more folks who have come alive.--- Make sure to check out The Mason Jar, a coming of age love story told from the male perspective by James Russell Lingerfelt.

Those less familiar with their difficulties may wish to read Endurance, by Alfred Lansing. It's an exciting piece of Antarctic history at the very least.We, the Earth Vision Trust/Extreme Ice Survey team, are gently rocking in the moderately turbulent seas off the southern tip of South Georgia Island -- both the launching point and fateful end for Shackleton's journey. We've just completed the 780 nautical mile crossing of the Scotia Sea, starting from Elephant Island on the far northeastern reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula and ending here, in a little less than two days. In comparison, the same crossing took Shackleton and his team of five 17 days of suffering and a bit of dead-reckoning-luck to complete. The Extreme Ice Survey Team braves the weather to install cameras to monitor Risting Glacier. Photo Courtesy of Extreme Ice Survey ©Earth Vision Trust.It's late afternoon and long crepuscular rays of sunlight are breaking through the clouds hovering over sharp peaks that climb out of the sea directly in front of us. We're on a scouting trip into the six mile-long Drygalski Fjord, a narrow slit that splits the southern end of the island nearly in half. Tomorrow we hope to install two cameras on Risting Glacier, sitting at the fjord's head, but the strong katabatic winds ripping off the glacier, combined with the abundant sea spray, are certainly foreboding. We play around on the top deck of the ship, leaning into the wind, which is blowing hard enough to nearly support our weight -- it feels as if we are flying. However, it's not exactly the type of gusts in which we particularly care to install delicate electronics. The volatile weather of the sub-Antarctic climate looks to be putting an end to the sunny and comfortable installations we've experienced over the past two weeks. Thinking about the historical difficulties associated with this wild island, it can only be expected that things won't come so easily.South Georgia has been a hub for whaling, Antarctic exploration, and as of late, adventure tourism, but driving the purpose for our visit here are the island's glaciers and wildlife. Glaciers pour off the Alaska-esque 9,000+ foot peaks that line the center of the island, which are met along the shores by thriving populations of fur seals, healthy colonies of king penguins, nesting albatross, bright green mosses, and gorgeous lichens. However, where the biodiversity is succeeding, the glaciers of South Georgia are struggling to maintain their presence in the warming climate.The glaciers today pale in comparison to when Shackleton and his men traversed the island nearly 100 years ago. Take for example Bertrab Glacier at the stunning Gold Harbor. Images from Shackleton's expedition show a robust glacier extending from high up, all the way down to the ocean. The glacier retained this appearance until the mid-1980s, when it began a dramatic retreat. It still provides a dramatic backdrop to the king penguins, but it's barely the glacier it was 30 years ago. Since the 1950s, the air temperature on South Georgia has warmed by nearly 3 degrees fahrenheit. This is driving the vast majority of glaciers across the island to retreat, including the treacherous slopes that gave the rundown party of explorers endless grief. Our cameras will be there to watch, capturing these changes frame-by-frame, day-by-day. Extreme Ice Survey cameras at Risting Glacier. Photo Courtesy of Extreme Ice Survey ©Earth Vision Trust.Turning back into Drygalski Fjord in the late afternoon of the next day, our hopes for calm winds are squashed by the telling whitecaps running down the fjord. The wind is steady at 40 knots. Captain Oliver turns the National Geographic Explorer sideways to the wind, providing a brief lull to load the Zodiac without getting completely drenched, a luxury that won't last long. Our eyes search the fjord wall for a relatively safe spot to install the cameras and we come to agree that a small rock perch about 200 feet up from the water and just over one mile from the terminus will work (it also happens to coincide with the terminus location as recently as 1993). Eric Guth, our newest honorary EIS team member and Lindblad Expeditions-National Geographic photo instructor extraordinaire, navigates a small kelp-filled bay and lands us ashore on a wind protected beach covered by a few dozen, ridiculously cute, fur seal pups. After unloading the equipment, Dan and I heave the horribly unbalanced battery packs over our shoulders and sneak our way past a few sleeping seals and continue up the slippery slope to our install site. At this point I'd say our clothes are manageably wet, but now that we're exposed to the full force of the wind and sideways rain, that quickly begins to change. The drilling begins, wires are tightened, and the housings go up as quickly as our wet and frozen fingers allow. The wind is making even small tasks incredibly difficult, but we manage to get two of the cameras running without too much rain soaking the housings. By now, our Gore-Tex outerwear appears as if we took a casual swim in the fjord. Just as the chill really starts to set in, we finish up and scramble back to our wind-protected beach. The seals stare curiously as each of us instinctively break into silly dances and jumping jacks, perhaps interpreted as a celebration after installing cameras eight and nine, but in reality, a feeble attempt to warm our core until the Explorer returns for us in about an hour. A difficult installation no doubt, but the warmth and comfort of the Explorer quickly changes our fortune. We're left thinking about the real hardships of the great explorers of the past, knowing we probably had that coming."

It's a question I had time to mull recently on my 14-hour plane ride back from Seoul, where I was for the launch of HuffPost Korea. While I was there I was amazed at their practice of Kouksundo -- a practice that combines meditation, breathing and martial arts and has been shown to boost productivity and reduce anxiety and stress -- which was so different from how we approach fitness.It's quite a contrast to the gyms that have become America's temples of physical well-being, with their bright lights, loud thumping music, uncomfortable furniture and machines that seem to have been designed by sadists, and populated by people who often seem miserable, joylessly going through the strenuous motions so they can check off the exercise box on that day's to-do list and get the heck out of there. There's a reason we call it ""working out"" as opposed to ""playing out.""And those are the ones motivated enough to actually drag themselves in. A large portion of health club members, even those paying hefty monthly fees, don't go. As Daniel Duane pointed out in Men's Journal, in order to make money, health clubs and gyms need to have around 10 times as many members as they're designed to accommodate.But does it have to be like this? Does going to the gym have to be something to be endured? After all, we know that physical activity is an incredibly powerful component of our overall well-being. Every day brings more evidence of the depth of the connection. For instance, one study out of Southern Methodist University found that the effects of physical activity on mild to moderate depression were so powerful that the study's author, Jasper Smits, wrote a guidebook urging mental health professionals to actually prescribe exercise as a medical intervention. There are also studies showing how regular physical activity increases cognitive function and brain connectivity. And, conversely, we also know how bad for us a lack of physical activity can be. According to an American Cancer Society study, people with a sitting job are more likely to develop cardiovascular disease than those with standing jobs. This is not a new discovery. A 1950s study of people in similar lines of work showed that London bus drivers had a higher incidence of death from cardiovascular disease than bus conductors, and that government clerks had a higher incidence than postal workers.The benefits of making our bodies fitter are deeply connected to the fitness of our inner selves, but gyms make it hard to feel that connection. They don't allow for the kind of solitude and mindfulness that we can get communing with nature on an outdoor run. And, overly muscled pickups aside, they aren't very conducive to making any real social connection. A person watching her own screen while walking on a treadmill next to another person watching another screen while walking on a treadmill is like a metaphor for our modern life. It's what we do at work, at home and at the gym.This is why Nicholas Miriello, a senior blog editor at HuffPost, prefers to use his daily run not just for his body but for his mind. ""On the subway, on the street, in the car between traffic lights, or worse, while driving, while watching television, while at work, while lying in bed, etc., we are glued to our phones, to our email, to our Twitter and Facebook and Instagram and Pinterest,"" he writes. So for him, running is the one time he has to disconnect. And ""soon after the moment of disconnect,"" he writes, ""I find myself actually connected. Connected with my surroundings, with my thoughts, with my body, with myself.""It's a hard experience to replicate at an indoor facility. But, fortunately, that's beginning to change. The Guardian's Nicole Mowbray writes about the growing trend of the ""calm workout,"" which she describes as ""a new breed of holistic workout that promises to care for your head as well as your heart."" For instance, there's Psycle, which offers spinning classes in rooms with low lights and calming music and features a ""free time"" break during the class. According to the company, its philosophy is inspired by the belief that ""your state of mind is key to how often and how hard you exercise."" There's also CardioLates, which combines spin and Pilates; Third Space, which offers the services of ""wellness doctors""; and Spynga, which is part spin, part yoga.These workouts are part of a trend driven by the understanding that getting fit doesn't have to be so unpleasant. And it's pretty simple to see that if we make exercise a more inviting and more rewarding experience, we'll do it more often. If we're going to redefine success to include well-being, we also need to redefine getting in shape to include mental and soul fitness."
