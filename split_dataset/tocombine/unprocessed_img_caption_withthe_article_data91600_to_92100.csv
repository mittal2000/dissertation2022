I didn't know her. Like many, though, I feel as if I did--from the words she shared in her book, on her blog and in her radio interviews. Tippetts, 38, was a warrior. She lost a battle with breast cancer, but she claimed victory in a larger war, one on fear. She dared to suggest breast cancer could be a ""great story,"" one that smacked of grace, and a chance to love and live better. ""I can say that cancer and suffering give the beautiful gift of perspective,"" Tippetts wrote in her book, The Hardest Peace: Expecting Grace in the Midst of Life's Hard. ""It is the gift you never wanted, the gift wrapped in confusion and brokenness and heartbreak. It's the gift that strips all your other ideas of living from you completely. The beautiful, ugly raising to the surface of the importance of each and every moment."" Kara Tippetts passed away March 22, 2015. She was 38. Photo courtesy of MundaneFaithfulness.comShe flew in the face of fears I've harbored since watching my mom die from breast cancer almost 26 years ago: fear of dying young, fear of being defined by cancer, fear of leaving children and a husband behind. Tippetts didn't succumb to them. She did lament passing on before seeing her children become adults. Yet she believed their lives would be richer for watching her live and die well. Impossible to IgnoreI heard about Tippetts last fall, from a friend. At first I gave her story half a glance. In the middle of a stream of biopsies and tests to determine whether I had breast cancer, I didn't want reminders of how it could plunder my life and cast my children into the motherless wilds I've known. Tippetts' story was as dreadful as it was radiant. I couldn't ignore it. I bought her book and checked her blog at least once a week. In unvarnished splendor, her words have brought me comfort. Her faith and resolve have reminded me of my mom. In the shadows of suffering, both women found joy and lavished it on others. To read Kara Tippetts is to bask in the gift of that joy and hopefully, to share it. When Tippetts passed away, she garnered media attention, sometimes referred to as the woman who tried to dissuade Brittany Maynard from assisted suicide. But she was far more. Instead of turning her sour, trouble revealed her strength. In waning health, Tippetts began using a wheelchair. ""You can imagine I don't love having a wheelchair. In some ways, it admits defeat. I'm learning a new corner of my own vanity,"" she wrote on her blog. Yet she looked for a way to soften the experience, and asked readers for ideas about what to name the wheelchair: ""Norman is my new ride. Yesterday I asked for name suggestions, and so many delightful names came through. Then I tried to think of a name that would help me not hate having a wheelchair. I then pictured a kind-faced, strong and weathered old grandpa that wanted to carry me for a bit. A sweet old man that said, 'tired one, let me carry you for a bit, you look like you could benefit from my strength.'""Freedom FoundDuring a recent show, Chris Fabry reflected on Tippetts' passing, and aired clips from an earlier interview he had with her. Below are some points he covered, along with my own thoughts:  Beauty exists in the middle of tragedy. A child gets cancer. A friend commits suicide. A parent is plagued by anxiety and depression. Sooner or later, such messes find us. If we wade into them with an exploring mindset, our discoveries can be startling in their beauty and alter our perspective on life. In the thick of her cancer fight, Tippetts authored a book and a blog, mothered four children and planted a church with her husband. Her story reached far more people than if she'd never been diagnosed with the illness. She encouraged, challenged, and offered a new view of hope and courage. Our stories, no matter how difficult, can be used for good. Whether it's cancer, depression or a difficult upbringing, sharing our trials with others can be a healing balm.After the birth of my first child, I faced postpartum depression. What was supposed to be one of the best times in my life devolved into one of the worst. Sharing my story helped me heal and stirred my desire to help other women, on a larger scale. That's taken shape in a book I'm writing.Don't resist suffering. Tippetts spoke of the challenge of releasing control over her life. Illness has a funny way of reminding us that control isn't ours to keep. After a few suspicious mammograms and biopsies last year, I wrestled with the idea of releasing control of my life. I relived the summer when my mom died, envisioning myself like her: swollen, unable to eat or sleep, pumped up on painkillers that turn a sharp mind into a muddle. I was afraid. When I focused on losing control, my fears grew.Clinging to the illusion of control fuels my fear. What happens when I stop clinging? By Tippetts' example, I see an opportunity for freedom--to stop striving, to live in grace, hope and enduring love, and to extend these to the people around me. This is true if I get cancer and fade at an early age, or if I live to 100.Disease ravaged Tippetts, as it did my mom, and suffering lined too many of their days. Instead of letting cancer dominate them, both women maintained a healthy outlook and a conquering spirit. They released the stress of trying to stay in control, and sought to revel in the day at hand. Along the way, they found joy and freedom."

(AP Photo/Nick Ut)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb168af2100006401c7350e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With humanity rapidly depleting earth's natural resources, the challenge to reverse the trend is daunting. Enter biomimicry, a promising strategy for turning the tide.Biomimicry is the practice of emulating nature by incorporating its principles into the production of goods and services. Such integration tends to enhance these goods' and services' environmental sustainability and minimize, if not eliminate, their drain on the earth's natural resources. This is testament to nature's consummate ability to recycle and preserve basic resources.Then there is another variation of biomimicry. It is hitching a ride on time-proven natural processes to reap the benefits of their tough-to-replicate functionality. Preserving coastal wetlands (or restoring them) as natural mitigating barriers against coastal storms and inland flooding is a case in point. Another example is designing buildings so that they naturally benefit from the sun's heat in the winter and the wind's cooling effect in the summer without need of mechanization.A hopeful sign is that Nature's animal and plant organisms' extraordinary engineering capabilities have already begun to be exploited by major industries around the world. Such erstwhile companies as 3M, Royal Dutch Shell, General Electric, and AT&T have integrated the concept into their business.What are some of the more striking manifestations of the phenomenon? African termites' ingenious construction of air shafts and tunnels in their climate-controlled dens has provided architects with a blueprint for insulating buildings without artificial intervention.Engineers have been stimulated to innovate by the bumps on the front of whale fins. They found that these protuberances reduced the drag that slows movement. Hence, the concept has been integrated into turbines, boat bottoms, and airplane wings, resulting in substantial energy savings.Vultures have even served as an inspiration. The birds have had success deterring poaching in Africa since they tend to hover over an illegal kill, drawing attention to the crime. Pivoting on this bird of prey's role, the Minnesota-based Lindbergh Foundation is financing the deployment of drones equipped with infrared surveillance systems to expose would-be poachers before they act.The Japanese have: created tiny solar batteries patterned after the way leaves turn sunlight into energy; gleaned from snail shells a method to produce self-cleaning tiles; and improved their bullet train's velocity through aerodynamic applications adopted from kingfishers' beaks and owls in flight.Some form of biomimicry has been practiced spottily since the onset of civilization, often by primitive tribes extracting curative substances from plants and animals.But what is now urgently needed is a concerted, comprehensive global effort to enlist nature for the sake of future generations, if not for our own."
2,HEALTHY LIVING,From Dormitory to Culinary,"Bruce Y. Lee, ContributorDirector of the Global Obesity Prevention Center (GOPC) and As...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/from-dormitory-to-culinar_b_7074350.html,"With the many followers and the attention that her website has garnered, Emily realizes the impact that college eating has during one's college years and beyond and has already had a very positive impact on public health.",2015-04-16,2015-04-15-1429135272-1706548-minimushroomandspinachquiche.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-15-1429135272-1706548-minimushroomandspinachquiche-thumb.jpg,"College can be a pivotal time in your life, establishing habits that may last well into adulthood... such as eating habits. With many new social influences, your eating habits can change quite drastically, often for the worse. You may have heard of the freshman 15... which refers to the average amount of weight a freshman in college gains. (Apparently, this used to be the freshman 10, which unfortunately may be saying something about the direction that we are headed, when it comes to obesity.) When I think of dormitory cafeteria food, I recall Jell-O. Lots of Jell-O of different colors. Both plain Jell-O and Jell-O with different things suspended in the Jell-O. Like grapes, peaches, pears, and other types of Jell-O. Our meal plan wasn't exactly a dietary paradise and did not exactly have a plethora of health options. Meanwhile, like baked beans in a stew, all of us college students were influencing each other's eating habits in not the best of ways. The most common food groups among students seemed to be meat (e.g., chicken, beef, and mystery), dairy, grains, chocolate, liquid grains, pizza, and Jell-O. Rarely did conversations cover healthy eating. Passing around food recipes was not common. (On the other hand, passing around drink recipes was quite common.) As time would teach me, not all of my classmates and peers were the best teachers. (Of course, they eventually did teach me that they weren't always the best teachers. So they were good at teaching that.)Like yeast in an oven, times are changing... especially in the past decade, with this thing that you may have heard of called ""social media"" and ""the Internet."" College students no longer have to rely just on those college students immediately around them for bad influence on food and eating. Instead, they can now rely on other college students hundreds or even thousands of miles or kilometers away to give each other bad advice on food and eating. Ah, but an example of how the ""Interwebs"" can lead to positive change in college student eating is Emily Hu's blog, Not Your Average College Food. Emily is currently an undergraduate here at Johns Hopkins University and the forward thinker behind this website that includes relatively simple but creative recipes that college students can use to cook tasty and healthy meals themselves. The idea for her website came during Emily's sophomore year at Hopkins. Emily was excited that her dormitory room had a stovetop but soon realized that her roommates didn't share her enthusiasm. The pure sound of the two words ""free food"" on the other hand, gets a group of college students feeling elated no matter what this may entail. They and many other college students didn't seem to be inclined to cook the food, eating the food was a different story. Many said no time and no materials. Emily -- a bright, creative, ""out-of-the cereal box"" thinker -- thought that there has to be a better way and, thus, started her blog. At first, like an egg in a skillet, Emily's blog initially stayed fairly local but eventually spread. Her blog readership grew and grew. Eventually, major news outlets and popular websites took notice such as NBC's Today Food, Buzzfeed, Greatist, National Public Radio, and, of course, the greatest website in the world, this one. Her website views have grown to almost 30,000, averaging around 500 views per day to see things such as mini mushroom and spinach quiche:The website includes a recipe index, with recipes divided by type of meal such as breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks, and a visual recipe index, which allows you to browse pictures of the end products in all their glory. Subsections include ""4 ingredients or less,"" ""No-Bake Desserts,"" and ""Nutella."" (During college, my recipes would have included a combined ""one-ingredient or less and Nutella category."") And her recipes don't simply consist of: get bread, put cheese in between, grill, and eat. Many of her offerings seem like they could easily appear in the menus of high-end restaurants, such as the Mini Mushroom and Spinach Quiche with Bacon, the Paella Valenciana, and the Dark Chocolate Avocado Truffles. Plus, background stories accompany each recipe entry such as how two snow days led to cancellation of classes and more recipes: ""The thrill of having a day with no classes propelled me to bake something and I wanted that 'something' to be healthy."" Other topics of her stories are her undying love for crockpots to her interpretation of the word ""bae."" An example of Emily's chic recipes is her Brown Sugar Glazed Salmon:To stay current on food trends, Emily continues to do extensive research. Last semester, Emily studied abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark, which by Emily's account is ""a great foodie city"" and where she sampled beef tartar with ants and bone marrow with cured egg yolk (two dishes that probably won't be making her blog soon). Emily also had the opportunity to dine at Noma, ranked in some lists as the  top ranked restaurant in the world (In college, my food research consisted of frequenting a local corner sandwich shop which eventually was closed by health inspectors and condemned). And research leads to things such as the rustic fruit tart:At a young age, Emily has already developed impressive expertise in food, nutrition, and health. (At the same age, my nutritional expertise consisted of knowing how many days after delivery one could still eat a cheese pizza.) This summer she will be interning at the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion in Washington, D.C., where she'll add to her burgeoning knowledge about food, nutrition and public health. With the many followers and the attention that her website has garnered, Emily realizes the impact that college eating has during one's college years and beyond and has already had a very positive impact on public health."

Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics, Occidental Col...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/union-busting-huntington-hospital-gets-into-the-voter-suppression_b_7075638.html,"How low will Huntington Memorial Hospital stoop to undermine its nurses' union drive? Dolly Farquhar -- who has worked at the Pasadena, California hospital for 31 years -- just found out.",2015-04-16,2015-04-16-1429154341-9690488-DollyFarquharHuntingtonNurse.jpeg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-16-1429154341-9690488-DollyFarquharHuntingtonNurse-thumb.jpeg," Huntington Hospital nurse Dolly Farquhar with two colleagues from the critical care unit How low will Huntington Memorial Hospital stoop to undermine its nurses' union drive?  Dolly Farquhar -- who has worked at the Pasadena, California hospital for 31 years -- just found out.  The hospital arbitrarily moved her resignation date from April 16 to April 12 so that Farquhar -- an outspoken supporter of the nurses' affiliation with the California Nurses Association (CNA) -- wouldn't be eligible to vote in the union election scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday of this week, April 15 and 16.Since the union drive began last May, the 123-year old 625-bed hospital (named for Henry E. Huntington, a turn-of-the-century railroad baron) has engaged in a nasty and expensive union-busting effort, paying a bevy of experienced and high-priced anti-union firms and consultants - including Littler Mendelson, IRI, and Genevieve Clavreul of Solutions Outside the Box -- to harass and intimidate nurses and undercut their organizing efforts. If a majority of the 1,220 nurses vote to unionize, the hospital will be required to negotiate a collective bargaining contract with the nurses, who will be represented by CNA. Taking a page from the Republican Party's escalating attack on voting rights among Democratic-leaning constituencies, the hospital has tried to restrict pro-union nurses from voting in this week's union election.  Last month, Farquhar -- who is well-known within the hospital as a pro-union supporter -- met with Patricia Villarroel, a senior benefits officer, to announce her plan to retire, effective April 16. They talked about Farquhar's pension plan and other benefits. When Villarroel told Farquhar that the hospital would continue to cover her health insurance until April 30, the 66-year old nurse was relieved, and began filling out paperwork to switch to Medicare starting May 1. Farquhar submitted her official resignation on March 26, went on a short vacation, and returned to Pasadena expecting to cast her ballot on Wednesday (April 15) in favor of giving nurses a voice at work.   She learned about the hospital's devious (and potentially illegal) action last Friday night, when the hospital sent a letter to her house announcing the change. A hospital-sent courier entered the service gate and dropped the envelope on Farquhar's front doorstep. The letter, signed by Candace McMullin from the hospital's human resources office and dated April 10, said that ""we've processed your resignation effective April 12."" It noted that her benefits, including health insurance, would expire that day.   ""The letter was a huge surprise, a real shock,"" explained Farquhar, ""because I had filled out my forms last month indicating that I had planned to retire effective April 16. I wanted to vote in the union election.""  ""Is this how they treat someone who has worked there since 1984?"" Farquhar asked. ""This is very dirty and very low.""  On Monday morning, Farquhar went to the hospital where she's worked for three decades to talk with CEO Steve Ralph. She had to enter the hospital through the patients' entrance because her employee identification card had already been deactivated.  ""He knows me,"" explained Farquhar, who worked in the critical care unit. ""I've been there over 30 years. My two daughters volunteered at the hospital when they were in high school. I figured he'd see me.""  Farquhar met Ralph in the hospital cafeteria, where they talked for about 20 minutes.   ""I told him I was really upset. I've done everything right. Then I get this letter, cutting off my medical benefits. I gave him all the paperwork. I said I didn't expect this kind of treatment. I've served this place loyally. Somebody had the audacity to arbitrarily change my date of my retirement from April 16 to April 12."" ""I told him that this is very dirty and very low.""   Farquhar -- who had spoken out in favor of the union at several hospital-sponsored forums where Ralph was present and had attended pro-union rallies -- didn't mention the union election in her conversation with Ralph, who makes over $1.2 million a year.  ""I didn't have to say anything about it,"" Farquhar explained, ""He knew why it happened.""  Yesterday (Wednesday) Farquhar went to the hospital to cast her vote in favor of unionization.  ""My suspicion was 100 percent accurate,"" she said. ""My name was on the list of employees, but I was in a different category than most of the other nurses."" At a pre-election conference yesterday, Robert Millman -- an attorney with Littler Mendelson, the expensive union-busting law firm that represents the hospital -- insisted that Farquhar be removed from the list of nurses eligible to cast ballot. CNA disagreed, so her name was kept on the list and she cast a ballot which a hospital-sponsored ""observer"" then officially challenged. The dispute will be resolved by the National Labor Relations Board after the election results are tabulated.  ""It's like not being a full citizen,"" said Farquhar. ""I've earned the right to vote. ""  A native of the Phillipines, where she earned her nursing degree, she came to the United States in 1970 to work at the famous Mayo Clinic in Minnesota. After two years, she moved to California, worked at a hospital in downtown Los Angeles, then joined the Huntington staff in 1984.   Farquhar expects to spend her retirement years traveling, playing with her three grandchildren, and tending to her new vegetable and herb garden.   ""But before that, I want to make sure that my vote will count. We're going to fight this. They're trying to disenfranchise me. That's why nurses need a voice at work. That's why we need a union.""--  Peter Dreier is professor of politics and chair of the Urban & Environmental Policy Department at Occidental College.

Playing sour Cuban salsa on tuba is Ted Cruz, who is competing with Marco Rubio's clumsy-too-fast-paced flamenco on broken guitar strings. These potentially refreshing younger wannabe first-stringer-Cuban-Americans must have studied under the wrong conductor. I hear out-of-touch-from-another-century wailing from their section. Please, can we get the orchestration correct, and move these two, along with their entire ""Republicanos""-not-ready-for-prime-time that bang the war drums way out of balance off the stage so they can study and practice for a few more years, or at least until they can hit the peaceful notes correctly.Seeing Raul Castro and the fading shadow of his brother, Fidel Castro, go flesh-to-flesh with President Obama was exactly the ""Change I Can Believe In"" that I twice voted for. This was precisely what candidate Obama promised to do before the country voted to accept his position. When an elected official fulfills their promises we need to thank them. The Summit of The Americas in Panama was a great performance in concert that only confident gentlemen acting like grownups on the world stage skillfully using ""new instruments"" could pull off. They deserve a two thumbs-up with a standing ovation of multiple curtain calls, not ridiculous seedy foot stomping and tired and stale Cold War shrills and boos.

A single mom who considered dinner to be my daughter's leftover chicken fingers, fries and Nutella, my dress size doubled as did my determination to re-ignite my writing career after eight years. Skin was aglow, heart afire. Still, I was deeply humbled by the following: 1. Nala, our Greyhound, has more muscles than I do. 2. My new juicer was worth more than my Subaru Outback. 3. Nala runs faster than my Outback.4. When I climbed 12 stairs from the gym parking lot to the second floor:Receptionist: ""Morning!""Me: Audible heaving.5. Raw, unsalted sunflower seeds piss me off.6. So did that receptionist.7. Daisy, my daughter/vegaphobe, adored roasted seaweed by the bagful. 8. Sadie, our Shepherd-Husky who once ate a club chair down to the wood, wouldn't touch the stuff. 9. Sipping green juice from a wine glass did not get me drunk.My longtime love affair with inertia? Done. Growing up, I survived on 1970s fare. Our extended family included the Stouffer's, the Entenmann's, and Chef Boyardee. Of course, there were times when I ate fruit. I don't recall when, but I'm sure I did. Oh, I drank a can of Mott's apple juice daily with my brown bag lunch. In high school, I could down a bagel with cream cheese and a pint of Ben & Jerry's Cherry Garcia, which I did, often, and stayed a size 6. In college, my culinary choices caught up with me. When I met Domino's acquaintance, I gained the cliché freshman 15 (ok, 20). Madison, Wisconsin's sub-zero temps did nothing to spark my abs and me to visit the campus gym. I didn't even know there was a campus gym until my friend Carolyn visited and with carrot juice in hand asked, ""Wanna take an aerobics class?"" I politely declined, then sat in my dorm lounge watching my food science class on closed-circuit TV.Over the 20 years since, my metabolism decided to U-turn, laughing each time I forget that eating Muenster by the hunk only boosts my dressing room angst. Though not a sweet freak, I have eaten much humble pie over the last 12 years. In 2003, my daughter Daisy lived in a Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for seven months due to complications from gastroschisis, a life-threatening, congenital anomaly that caused her intestines to malfunction. In February, 2006, my family and I moved from New York, where I grew up, to Omaha, so my girl could receive a small bowel, liver and pancreas transplant. Seven months later, she got PTLD, Post-Transplant Lymphoproliterative Disorder, a lymphoma, and endured four months of chemotherapy. Though Daisy survived, thank God, my marriage did not. Like a marathoner, I was hyper-disciplined about what I ate, as I was during pregnancy -- only protein, fruits, vegetables, brain-boosting nuts, gallons of water -- knowing that I needed to care for myself in order to care for her. That said, after particular crises, like regular 2:00 a.m. ER runs and managing potentially fatal IV line infections, I often regulated my anxiety with food. It was the classic if-I-can't-control-my-environment-I-can-control-my-intake rationale. Unconscious, of course, yet it became a balm for my cracked heart. Thankfully, I had a two-decade head start learning how to train my body and mind. Pre-Daisy, luxuries like time, singledom, and NYC's top resources like acupuncture, homeopathy and therapy helped prep me for what lay ahead, as if God was saying, ""Rest up, honey."" Once disaster struck, it was easier, then, to stay more grounded at the starting line than I would have otherwise been. One particular experience enlightened me, and snuck up on me. At the Catskill's New Age Health Spa, where junk food was forbidden, my sister and I snuck out to a nearby general store, stocked up on Tootsie Rolls and gorged in the car. Afterwards, the unsuspecting nutritionist, a lovely, delusional woman, said -- get this -- ""You have choices."" She handed me Autobiography in Five Short Chapters. ""I walk down the street/There is a deep hole in the sidewalk/I fall in/I am lost/I am helpless/It isn't my fault/It takes me forever to find a way out."" I learned a new language, like Daisy, who at 7 1/2 months spit out, ""Mama."" I've gone vegan, vegetarian and periodically nix wheat, gluten, and sugar, all which give me vile headaches and make me look and feel like Mr. Creosote, the exploding fat man in Monty Python's The Meaning of Life. Why did I choose these strategies? Not strictly to lose weight (though I do covet the day that I fit into the parallel, Twiggy-esque wardrobe I've amassed), but to gain mental health. Eating greens over beiges, drinking warm lemon water in the morning and nibbling on protein every two hours, I've learned, gives me the strength and clarity to deal with what passes as crises these days, like arguing with Daisy over which one of us will marry Eddie Redmayne. Best of all, it amps up my perkiness. But be warned: don't offer me raw, unsalted sunflower seeds."
8,HEALTHY LIVING,Deepak Chopra Has A Very Simple Way Of Knowing If You're Meditating Correctly,Sasha Bronner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/deepak-chopra-meditation_n_7059440.html,,2015-04-15,"Deepak Chopra arrives for the first ever concert by Paul McCartney at Harlem's Apollo Theater, Monday, Dec. 13, 2010 in New York. (AP Photo/Henny Ray Abrams)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9eaea81f00002d00221c40.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Deepak Chopra's meditation litmus test is simple: “If you’re doing it, you’re doing it right.” The meditation and mindfulness guru spoke to The Huffington Post at a recent event in Los Angeles to celebrate his daughter, Mallika Chopra, who had just published the new book, ""Living with Intent: My Somewhat Messy Journey to Purpose, Peace, and Joy.” Later in the afternoon, Deepak led the hushed room into a guided meditation, his voice deep and calming, as he offered a seamless transition from a buzzing social atmosphere to a suddenly deeply internal one. “Meditation is a progressive quieting of the mind until you get to the source of the mind, which is pure consciousness,” Chopra explained in an interview before the event began, his bejeweled transition glasses slowly lightening from dark to clear. “You are not your mind or your thoughts. You are the consciousness in which the thoughts come and go.”Guests, including many of the Chopra family, packed themselves tightly into the meditation room at Unplug Meditation in West Los Angeles as Mallika told the room that her parents taught her to meditate at age nine and that she would come home from school and meditate with her mother as a way to feel close. Chopra learned to meditate 35 years ago in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “I was lucky enough to have Maharishi Yogi as my direct teacher. He was the teacher for the world at the time, including the Beatles” he said.He went on to found The Chopra Center in 1996, a renowned institute near San Diego that teaches all levels of meditation. He has published over 65 books and has made a name (and fortune) for himself as a prominent mind-body spiritual guru. He and Oprah Winfrey have their own meditation alliance and host challenges in the hopes of bringing meditation to as many people as possible around the world.Chopra says that meditation can have profound benefits for any person, depending on what they need. “If they’re very stressed, it’s a good way to deal with stress. It has immediate effects in terms of better sleep and more energy,” he said. “As you get more into meditation, you realize that there are hundreds of variations of meditation depending on what you’re wanting to achieve.”But regardless of how advanced one gets, the ultimate goal of meditation is to look within: “Everything that we assume is our identity is really not our permanent identity. Your body is changing all the time, your mind is fickle, your emotions go up and down, your personality is hopefully not the same throughout life. So is there a part of you that is fundamental?”The more advanced techniques of meditation that Chopra teaches privately and at his center involve what he calls contemplative inquiry: “How [do we] differentiate between experience and the consciousness in which the experience occurs?” Referring to people who have been meditating for 15 or 20 years, Chopra says that when they get to this place in their practice, “there is a complete loss of fear of death. Because there is no fear of death, there is a loss of the fear of everything else that is impermanent. In a way, the fear of death is the fear of impermanence.”Chopra meditates for two hours every morning and then does another 20 minutes or so later in the day. Many meditation practices, including mantra meditation, Transcendental meditation and mindfulness meditation call for about ten to 20 minutes either once or twice a day. “If you say you don’t have time to do it once a day,” Chopra said, “then you’re the one who probably needs it twice a day.” "

Switzer,"" wearing a bulky sweatsuit. At the time, the Amateur Athletics Union (AAU) did not admit women into marathons. Switzer became the first female to officially enter and run. The photo of a race official forcibly attempting to stop her and grabbing for her race numbers was the photo shot heard round the world. Life magazine listed the photo as one of the ""100 Photographs That Changed The World."" Switzer was determined to cross the finish line, despite blistered and bloodied feet. She had to wear men's athletic shoes she had ordered from Europe. Quite a feat! Athletic shoes for females were not yet manufactured because there was not a large enough market.The AAU did not formally accept females in long-distance running until the fall of 1971. Women officially started to compete in the Boston Marathon in 1972. That was the same year Congress passed Title IX, Ms. Magazine was launched and Helen Reddy's ""I Am Woman"" topped the charts. Billie Jean King was named the first Sports Illustrated Sports Woman of the Year in 1972.Nina Kuscsik's 1972 victory made her the first official Boston Marathon female champion in its 74-year history. That year eight females started the race and all eight finished. Kuscsik, 33, was the mother of three children under age six. Since the first eight women were officially entered and finished the Boston Marathon and groundbreaking Title IX legislation was passed, women's participation in long-distance events has grown and boomed.Switzer went on to win the 1974 New York City Marathon, finishing 59th overall. In 1975, in the fourth Boston Marathon to officially recognize female competitors, Switzer finished second place.It was a long-distance race for women to compete in local, national and world-wide marathons, leading up to the Olympic Marathon. In 1896, marathons became an Olympic sport, a year before the first Boston Marathon. Opponents to admitting women stated the race was too physically strenuous. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) issued a statement in 1980 that ""there exists no conclusive scientific or medical evidence that long-distance running is contraindicated for the healthy trained female athlete. The ACSM recommends that females be allowed to compete at the national and international level in the same distances in which their male counterparts compete."" In February of 1981, the Executive Board of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) gave its approval for a women's marathon to be included in the l984 Summer Games in Los Angeles. The following September the IOC elected its first female members in its 84-year history and voted on the Board's recommendations that females had finally won the right to compete in an Olympic Marathon.A two-time Boston Marathon winner (1979 and 1983), the following summer Joan Benoit Samuelson won the first Olympic Marathon for women, leading 50 women from 28 countries; 44 finished. Switzer, women's running pioneer and long-time champion for the Olympic marathon, served as a commentator for ABC Sports. Samuelson became the first person to win both the Boston and Olympic Marathons. She won the 1985 Chicago Marathon and the Sullivan Award as the outstanding U.S. amateur athlete that year. Samuelson continued to set age-group records, including at 57, in the 2014 Boston Marathon.The 2015 Boston Marathon entrant field consists of 46 percent females -- 13,682 females, along with 16,452 men. The women's winner now takes in $150,000., the same prize money as the men's. According to Running USA, 43 percent of finishers nationwide today are female -- almost 240,000 female finishers, compared to less than 20 percent of finishers during the 1970s.Sole Searching: The Right to Shoes The rise of female runners, marathoners and active athletes overall, has created an increasing mass market. Reebok introduced its first shoe designed especially for females in 1982. Nike named its first signature shoe model for a female, the Air Swoopes, for Sheryl Swoopes, in 1996. For too long, female athletes had to wear ""shrink and pink"" replicas of men's shoes in smaller sizes.The Sports & Fitness Industry Association (SFIA) reports that women's athletic shoes represent 22 percent of the market, making the women's sports footwear retail market about 4.8 billion in the U.S. Runners World launched Zelle, a website for female runners to share personal stories, in October. Salute to SwitzerSwitzer was named one of five running visionaries of the 20th century by Runners World. In 2011, she was inducted into the National Women's Hall of Fame, for her ongoing effort in creating positive social change around the world. A vocal champion for female runners and athletes, her lobbying and legwork, along with Kuscsik, led to the inaugural women's Olympic Marathon. Her 261 Fearless Movement, named for her original Boston Marathon bib number, in empowering women around the world through running. Switzer plans to run Boston again in 2017, the 50th anniversary of her initial run. You go girl!Here's an interesting footnote. Appropriately, for a woman always on the run, Switzer met her husband, Roger Robinson, a former world-class runner, when they were both speaking at a running seminar in Australia. They moved to New Zealand and got married in 1987.Read more about female runners and role models making historic milestones at  here."

Luckily, this is an easy reality in the U.S., thanks to an abundance of amazing national parks. Here are the 5 most road trip-worthy.1. Badlands National Park, South DakotaTucked into South Dakota's southwest corner, Badlands National Park greets visitors with an otherworldly landscape of rust-colored buttes, spires, and pinnacles rising across thousands of acres. Start your road trip on the 40-mile Badlands Loop Scenic Byway, stopping at overlooks to gasp at gullies, canyons, and the occasional bison sighting. From the park, drive 90 minutes southwest across I-90 and down SD-240 to Mount Rushmore and pay homage to one of America's most iconic sights: the enormous, carved faces of Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Lincoln. Dennis Frates / Alamy2. Glacier National Park, MontanaGlacier-carved, snow-capped mountains rise above sapphire lakes throughout Glacier National Park. Road trippers can stop to trek trails marked by waterfalls and frequented by bighorn sheep while driving famed Going-to-the-Sun Road, named after the mountain looming beyond Logan Pass. This 50-mile, two-lane road slices through the park, and scenic overlooks and pullouts line the route. Base yourself in a lodge located on the park grounds, like Many Glacier Hotel, and spend a few days exploring the road's must-sees including Wild Goose Island and Jackson Glacier Overlook, then stopping to hike at Siyeh Bend trailhead. Aurora Photos / Alamy3. Acadia National Park, MaineStart your Acadia National Park road trip before dawn, watching the sunrise atop Cadillac Mountain. The peak marks the North Atlantic seaboard's highest point, and offers one of the first views of sunrise in the United States. Drive the park's 27-mile loop road, admiring craggy coastlines and stopping to hike around Jordan Pond, then refueling with popovers at Jordan Pond House (these pastries have been a favorite here since the 1890s). From the park, drive 14 miles south to Bass Harbor Head Lighthouse. Perched upon rocky shores and surrounded by weathered pines, the 19th-century tower and adjacent cottage comprise one of America's most photographed lighthouses. 2/Diane Diederich/Ocean/Corbis4. Grand Canyon National Park, ArizonaMost Grand Canyon visitors see only the popular South Rim, though it's an easy road trip to the equally breathtaking--and far less crowded--North Rim. Start your trip at the South Rim, where a hop-on, hop-off shuttle brings you to major pullouts and trailheads offering views into the canyon's abyss and glimpses of the Colorado River below. From here it's a five-hour drive to the North Rim, home to twisting trails and panoramic views of the canyon's crevices, cliffs, and bluffs. Pause to visit historic Grand Canyon Lodge, where travelers can unwind on Adirondack chairs overlooking the canyon. Michele Falzone/info@awl-images.com/JAI/Corbis5. Blue Ridge Parkway to Shenandoah National Park, North Carolina/VirginiaIn the early morning hours, the winding Blue Ridge Parkway grants road trippers views of mountain passes and valleys cloaked in a misty, blue haze. Stretching from the Tennessee-North Carolina border into Virginia, the route is popular during autumn when colorful foliage attracts leaf peepers to the region. Before hopping onto the Parkway, drive to Clingman's Dome, the Great Smoky Mountains' highest peak. En route to Shenandoah snap photos of scenic Mabry Mill, and visit Mount Mitchell's summit, the highest point east of the Mississippi River.

Luckily, this is an easy reality in the U.S., thanks to an abundance of amazing national parks. Here are the 5 most road trip-worthy.1. Badlands National Park, South DakotaTucked into South Dakota's southwest corner, Badlands National Park greets visitors with an otherworldly landscape of rust-colored buttes, spires, and pinnacles rising across thousands of acres. Start your road trip on the 40-mile Badlands Loop Scenic Byway, stopping at overlooks to gasp at gullies, canyons, and the occasional bison sighting. From the park, drive 90 minutes southwest across I-90 and down SD-240 to Mount Rushmore and pay homage to one of America's most iconic sights: the enormous, carved faces of Presidents Washington, Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Lincoln. Dennis Frates / Alamy2. Glacier National Park, MontanaGlacier-carved, snow-capped mountains rise above sapphire lakes throughout Glacier National Park. Road trippers can stop to trek trails marked by waterfalls and frequented by bighorn sheep while driving famed Going-to-the-Sun Road, named after the mountain looming beyond Logan Pass. This 50-mile, two-lane road slices through the park, and scenic overlooks and pullouts line the route. Base yourself in a lodge located on the park grounds, like Many Glacier Hotel, and spend a few days exploring the road's must-sees including Wild Goose Island and Jackson Glacier Overlook, then stopping to hike at Siyeh Bend trailhead. Aurora Photos / Alamy3. Acadia National Park, MaineStart your Acadia National Park road trip before dawn, watching the sunrise atop Cadillac Mountain. The peak marks the North Atlantic seaboard's highest point, and offers one of the first views of sunrise in the United States. Drive the park's 27-mile loop road, admiring craggy coastlines and stopping to hike around Jordan Pond, then refueling with popovers at Jordan Pond House (these pastries have been a favorite here since the 1890s). From the park, drive 14 miles south to Bass Harbor Head Lighthouse. Perched upon rocky shores and surrounded by weathered pines, the 19th-century tower and adjacent cottage comprise one of America's most photographed lighthouses. 2/Diane Diederich/Ocean/Corbis4. Grand Canyon National Park, ArizonaMost Grand Canyon visitors see only the popular South Rim, though it's an easy road trip to the equally breathtaking--and far less crowded--North Rim. Start your trip at the South Rim, where a hop-on, hop-off shuttle brings you to major pullouts and trailheads offering views into the canyon's abyss and glimpses of the Colorado River below. From here it's a five-hour drive to the North Rim, home to twisting trails and panoramic views of the canyon's crevices, cliffs, and bluffs. Pause to visit historic Grand Canyon Lodge, where travelers can unwind on Adirondack chairs overlooking the canyon. Michele Falzone/info@awl-images.com/JAI/Corbis5. Blue Ridge Parkway to Shenandoah National Park, North Carolina/VirginiaIn the early morning hours, the winding Blue Ridge Parkway grants road trippers views of mountain passes and valleys cloaked in a misty, blue haze. Stretching from the Tennessee-North Carolina border into Virginia, the route is popular during autumn when colorful foliage attracts leaf peepers to the region. Before hopping onto the Parkway, drive to Clingman's Dome, the Great Smoky Mountains' highest peak. En route to Shenandoah snap photos of scenic Mabry Mill, and visit Mount Mitchell's summit, the highest point east of the Mississippi River.

Santa Monica Farmers Market Even in midwinter, nothing beats flying in to Los Angeles from icy NYC and finding yourself surrounded by tables full of artichokes, avocados, and an astonishing array of citrus (and all this in mid-February). California is produce heaven and this market, thriving since 1981, is the grand dame of the Los Angeles farm-to-table scene. Look for J.J.'s Lone Daughter Ranch, where Laura Ramirez sells more kinds of avocados than you knew existed (I love a smoky variety called Bacon) alongside variegated pink lemons, tangelos, and Cara Cara oranges. Sienna Van Nostrand / Alamy2. Hollywood Farmers Market With its cross-section of hip families from the canyon neighborhoods and artsy east side types, this extensive Sunday market is one of my favorites for people watching. It takes the shape of a big cross intersection, with one of the four pedestrian-only streets devoted to food stalls serving Corn Maiden tamales, sourdough loaves at Bezian bakery, and lavender honey or lemon verbena ice cream at Carmela. Some of my favorite vendors include Jimenez Farms for vegetables and berries, and Sweet Tree Farms for other fruits. Go early to beat the crowds. ZUMA Press, Inc. / Alamy3. Dupont Circle FRESHFARM Market This bustling market packs a lot of variety into a cluster of streets and plazas around leafy Dupont Circle. Be prepared to weave between strollers, bicyclists, and dogs on leashes to find herb plants at Four Seasons Nursery; small-batch cheese at Keswick Creamery; charcuterie and salumi at Three Little Pigs; and pickles, kimchi and sauerkraut at No. 1 Sons. Jim West / Alamy4. Old Oakland Farmers Market From the moment it opens in the morning, this market is bustling with shoppers from Oakland's neighboring Chinatown. But braving the competitive atmosphere is worth it to see bushels of Asian vegetables such as yardlong beans, bitter melons, luffa, lemongrass, shiso, and Vietnamese coriander, or to learn the difference between yu choy, pei tsai, and pak choy. Finish your visit with lunch at one of the food vendors in the revamped Housewives Market (also called Swan's Market)--I recommend the expertly made tacos at Cosheca Cafe. Sergio Ruiz, Visit Oakland5. Ferry Plaza Farmers Market For those interested in the roots of foodie fixations such as locally sourced, organic, and sustainable farm-to-table eating, start here. This place is a who's who of the country's most well-known and influential purveyors, including Cowgirl Creamery, Blue Bottle Coffee, Far West Fungi, Frog Hollow Farm, Green Gulch Farm, Hog Island Oyster Co., and June Taylor jams and jellies.

Publicolor, which offers school beautification programs and college and career prep, hosted their annual Stir, Splatter + Roll gala at Martin Luther King Jr. High School in New York City last week. Among the host of tastemakers was a young man, Peterson Saint Louis, who shared his testimony of how the program has impacted his life. After being bullied in school, he discovered Publicolor in the fall of 2010. Without any prior experience in art he became part of the program's team, transforming dull public school settings into vibrant colorful spaces. According to him, the program provided a much-needed support system as his family struggled with poverty, housing evictions, and the personal challenges that came with him being the first person in his family to go to college.  Peterson Saint Louis/Courtesy: Publicolor""My mom struggled to pay the rent and I was in college. I thought I'd have to quit school,"" he shared. ""Publicolor helped me pay the school costs to get back on track. I didn't want to give up on my dreams and Publicolor helped me out.""Now with his family back on solid financial ground he is focused on finishing college and sharing the news about the work of Publicolor. According to the program's 2014 statistics the high school dropout rate of its students is zero percent, with 94 percent of those who go on to college returning after their first-year.

18,LATINO VOICES,Bed Quota Fuels 'Inhumane' And 'Unnecessary' Immigrant Detention: Report,Roque Planas,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/private-prison-immigrant-detention_n_7072902.html,,2015-04-15,"ELOY, AZ - JULY 30: A cactus and sign mark the entrance to the Eloy Detention Facility for illegal immigrants on July 30, 2010 in Eloy, Arizona. Most immigrants at the center, operated by the Corrections Corporation of America (CCA), are awaiting deportation or removal and return to their home countries, while some are interned at the facility while their immigration cases are being reviewed. The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), in Arizona holds almost 3,000 immigrants statewide, all at the detention facilities in Eloy and nearby Florence. Arizona, which deports and returns more illegal immigrants than any other state, is currently appealing a judge's ruling suspending controversial provisions of Arizona's immigration enforcement law SB 1070. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baea54a1f00002e0122fdd0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The private prison industry’s growing role in immigrant detention is due in part to Congress' requiring the federal government to maintain some 34,000 detention beds, according to a report released Wednesday. The report, drafted by Grassroots Leadership, a nonprofit based in Austin, Texas, calls on Congress to eliminate the immigrant detention quota from its 2016 appropriations request. The detention bed mandate was first inserted into the Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2010. Today, private companies control about 62 percent of the immigrant detention beds used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to the report. That's up from 49 percent in 2009. The rest of the beds are operated by the federal government. Of the 10 largest immigrant detention centers in the country, nine are operated by private companies. “We simply detain too many people, and the federal mandate certainly drives a lot of that,” Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) said Wednesday on a call with reporters organized by Grassroots Leadership. “Frankly, I think if you eliminate the bed mandate, that’s the first step toward eliminating privatization, because that’s a huge thing that’s driving their profits.” The two largest private prison companies involved in detention -- Corrections Corporation of America and the GEO Group -- have lobbied Congress in order to push up the number of required immigrant detention beds, according to the study. CCA and the GEO Group together took in nearly half a billion dollars from immigrant detention services in 2014 alone, according to Grassroots. CCA did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Pablo Paez, a spokesman for the GEO Group, denied that the company plays a role in promoting immigrant detention. ""As a matter of long-standing policy, GEO's governmental advocacy focuses on promoting the benefits of public-private partnerships and does not encompass immigration policies, which are set exclusively by the federal government,"" Paez told The Huffington Post in an email. But the Grassroots report, citing lobbying disclosure forms, says that both companies have lobbied Congress on immigration issues. Between 2008 and 2014, CCA directly lobbied members of the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, which set the bed quota, according to the report. Both CCA and the GEO Group have acknowledged in filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission that immigration reform or other efforts to liberalize the immigrant detention system would undermine the companies' business, the report says. Both companies received contracts to operate family detention centers in Texas following the child migrant crisis last year. CCA runs the newly constructed, 2,400-bed family detention center at Dilley, while the GEO Group operates a 530-bed family detention center in Karnes City. Mothers detained at the Karnes City facility have launched hunger strikes twice this month to protest their continued detention while they apply for asylum. Marichuy Leal, a transgender woman who was released from a CCA-run detention facility in Eloy, Arizona, this year, described her detention as a traumatic experience. “I got tortured in Mexico,” Leal said on Wednesday's call. She said she came to the United States seeking asylum, “but my torture kept going in the detention center. There’s no safety in the detention center where I got detained. I was abused by my cellmate, abused by the security guards.”Bethany Carson, a co-author of the study who spoke on the call, said the detention bed quota is “inhumane” and “unnecessary.” The Grassroots report urges policymakers to reduce the number of required detention beds through “community-based” alternatives to detention. The report does not describe those alternatives in detail, but Grassroots has in the past endorsed programs in which immigration authorities partner with non-governmental organizations to ensure that released migrants comply with court proceedings and find access to community services.“The only beneficiaries from the detention quota are for-profit corporations that benefit from human pain,” Carson told reporters.

For historians and political scientists, April 14 is also a time for playful speculation. What would have happened, the common question goes, if Lincoln had lived? Certainly, history would have been demonstrably different in unknowable ways. But what about Lincoln’s reputation? Would it be so exalted? Or did some of his dignity come from his death? He was not, at the time he went to Ford’s Theater, universally venerated. The night he was killed, he had invited 14 separate people to attend ""Our American Cousin"" with him. All said no. The Huffington Post asked three separate Lincoln historians to engage in the hypothetical -- to offer their takes on how things would have been different had he not been shot the fateful night. Here are their answers, edited only slightly.Stephen Carter, author of The Impeachment Of Abraham Lincoln, on why Lincoln would have been a middle-of-the-road POTUS had he lived:Presidents don't have to be assassinated to become iconic, but it probably helps. We remember Abraham Lincoln, as we should, as the Great Emancipator whose leadership and determination won the Civil War. But suppose he had survived Booth's bullet. Would he still rival George Washington in polls on the greatest American president? Or would he instead be remembered as a sort of 19th-century Lyndon Johnson, a deeply flawed president who accomplished certain great and important things but messed up others?Professor Jay Winik, author of April 1865: The Month That Saved America, on why Lincoln would have remained among the greats:[W]hat if he had lived, surviving the assassination attempt on April 14, 1865? Professor Richard Striner, author of Father Abraham: Lincoln's Relentless Struggle to End Slavery, on Lincoln’s second-term agenda had he not been shot:While it's obviously impossible to know what Lincoln would have done in a second term if he had lived, all the signs point toward a growing partnership between Lincoln and the Radical Republicans on behalf of black civil rights."

The 100th anniversary of the start of the tragedy -- which Armenians trace back to the arrest of the leaders of the Armenian community in Istanbul on April 24, 1915 -- has been a matter of major concern for Turkey with the government seeking to engage in offensive diplomacy.

His remarks prompted Turkey to summon the Vatican's ambassador to the Holy See and to recall its own.The European Parliament sprang to the Pope's defense, commending the message the pontiff delivered at the weekend.Turkey is a candidate country to join the 28-nation EU but accession talks have dragged on for years with little progress.Earlier, Erdogan told a news conference that ""whatever decision the European Parliament takes on Armenian genocide claims, it would go in one ear and out the other.""""It is out of the question for there to be a stain, a shadow called 'genocide' on Turkey,"" he said at Ankara airport before departing on a visit to Kazakhstan.Then prime minister Erdogan last year offered what his government said were unprecedented condolences to the grandchildren of Armenians killed in World War One.The parliament's resolution said such statements were a step in the right direction, but legislators urged Turkey to go further and to recognize the events as genocide.""We shouldn't forget that people were murdered and that these particular events are rightly described as a genocide ... I believe this should lead to a further recognition by Turkey that there was a genocide under the Ottoman empire,"" German Christian Democrat Elmar Brok said.In a statement after the vote, Turkey's foreign ministry said lawmakers who backed the resolution were in partnership with ""those who have nothing to do with European values and feeding on hatred, revenge and the culture of conflict.""
