0,TASTE,Cooking Off The Cuff: Risotto As The Platform For A Great Dinner,"Edward Schneider, ContributorTravel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-riso_b_5234200.html,"This isn't clever plating; it happens automatically when some of the sauce slides over the rice. Looks great, doesn't it?",2014-04-30,The model: Osso buco with risotto milanese at London's Cafe Murano,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e04ea2400003000954d4b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"When Jackie and I eat risotto at home -- which is pretty often -- it is usually as a standalone dish in which the marquee ingredient (such as winter squash) is incorporated into the rice. Indeed, I'd almost forgotten that one of the great classics of northern Italian cooking is braised veal shanks (osso buco) with saffron risotto. Then, I was reminded about risotto's virtues as a base for meat and its sauce by dinners in a couple of London restaurants run by my friend Angela Hartnett: Murano and its newer offshoot Cafe Murano. Murano frequently offers lightly flavored risottos accompanied by more intense braises; I think of rich shredded oxtail lurking under a pale, elegant risotto made with leeks. And from the moment the Cafe opened, in 2013, its menu has included a particularly nice version of osso buco with Milanese-style saffron risotto.I love those dishes yet somehow never got around to making their like at home. But that changed the other week, when we had a couple of slices of leftover braised pork butt with a little of their sauce: not really sufficient for two portions of meat, but more than enough to yield a bite of pork with each spoonful of risotto. Then last weekend I cooked a few pounds of lamb neck (maybe the best braising cut of all) from our Greenmarket sheep farmer, 3-Corner Field Farm, with the express intention of serving it with risotto.You know how to braise meat (i.e., cook a stew); you know how to make a basic risotto too -- or at least you have ways to learn. So I am going to highlight what might be different from your standard operating procedure.On the meat, which can and should be cooked a day or two ahead of time: It must be a cut that can become fork-tender without drying out. That's why veal shanks are classic for this sort of dish: like the lamb and pork cuts I used, they have sufficient connective tissue to ""melt"" after long, slow cooking and bring about that gelatinous consistency you want. Among other good options would be lamb shanks, lamb shoulder, beef short ribs (or boneless chuck short ribs) and oxtail. Whatever you select, it should be well browned and braised with lots of aromatic vegetables, wine (generally white, but if red is what's handy that's fine, especially with beef) and stock. This can be chicken stock or it can be made with the kind of meat you're using - or it can be vegetable stock. If you haven't got any stock, by all means use water, but up the seasoning and add something savory such as mushrooms, soy sauce (in moderation) or even a small piece of dried kombu seaweed (kelp). Whatever liquid you use, supplement it with some tomato -- maybe half a cup of simple tomato sauce or chopped tomatoes, or a squirt of tomato paste.Once it has become very tender -- which in an oven a trifle hotter than 325 degrees F (say, 165 C) could take a couple of hours -- let it rest in the braising liquid for half an hour before removing the meat and straining the liquid. Get rid of all those tired vegetables, but use a cooking spoon to press them firmly in the strainer to squeeze all the remaining good out of them. And use your fingers to pick the meat off the bones and break/shred it into bite-size pieces, returning them to the liquid as you work. While you're at it, scrap any particularly disagreeable globs of soft fat but be sure you're not discarding meaty bits. Refrigerate, then remove the congealed fat from the surface.As is, with its rather liquid sauce, this would now be delicious served as a stew or with broad egg noodles such as pappardelle. But set on top of a risotto, it would turn the rice into a sort of soup. So you need to transform some (not all) of the braising liquid into something richer, denser and more viscous, about 1/4 cup per portion. The first step is simply to reduce it in a pan over medium heat. It should taste rich and have a nice dark color -- and it should possess a sauce-like consistency: just about as thick as cream, say. If it gets to the right flavor and color but remains watery, you could thicken it very, very lightly, either by gradually stirring a cornstarch slurry into the simmering liquid or by whisking in some butter. But with any luck -- and especially if you've used some sort of meat stock in the braise -- flavor, color and consistency will be achieved simultaneously.On the risotto: This should be a simple, standard saffron-flavored risotto, like a classic risotto Milanese, but with no bone marrow or ham or any other meat. For the liquid, use dilute chicken or vegetable stock into which saffron threads have been infused: keep the stock very light, because this risotto must taste clearly of saffron and, most important, rice. Finish it, as usual, with butter and Parmesan vigorously stirred in to create a creamy consistency: also as usual, it is better that the risotto should be too loose than too stiff.To serve, dish out nice portions of golden risotto, top each with not too much meat (reheated in the remains of its original braising liquid, not in the new richer sauce), then spoon the reduced sauce over each portion of meat. In the photographs of Cafe Murano's osso buco and even more so of my lamb variation, you'll see a lovely thread of sauce around the perimeter of the rice. This isn't clever plating; it happens automatically when some of the sauce slides over the rice. Looks great, doesn't it?You'll have leftover meat, probably; with at least some of it you should go the pappardelle route, brightening the braising liquid with herbs and either olives or something like diced carrots, plus some lemon or orange zest if you like."

She's interested in facts and information. She recycles information and makes art out of it. As part of her recent show at Bureau, Four Thousand Blocks, she created, for example, a letter press print of a dialogue between the King of Egypt and the god Thoth about the pros and cons of the gifts the god is contemplating giving to humankind. Thoth says, ""I can't think of anything bad to say about writing. It will make humans wiser and improve their memories. The recipe for memory has been discovered.""In this case the king appears to be wiser than his divinely inspired counterpart when he responds, ""What you have discovered is not a recipe for memory, but the drug of reminding. With your invention they will be taught, but they will not be wiser.""It's nice know that even the ancients were worried that technological advances could result in the attrition of certain human faculties--as we do today in considering how certain kinds of thinking have become the province of the computer. The show was composed of a three channel video related to the artist's experience of the Pharos excavation which also involved underwater dives. One screen is primarily a dark room in which images are developing. A central screen is a documentary involving the process by which the artist gained information about the excavation and the third is simply compartments filled with metallic type out of which Ga picks letters to create a story. It's explained that a good type setter can decipher the sentence that is being created by simply watching the movement of hands between these compartments. Synchronicity might be one word to describe what Ellie Ga is attempting. Big data is another, but the net result is to winnow and exhibit the affect of historical enormity on the human imagination.Ellie Ga, Projection Harbor, 2013This was originally posted to The Screaming Pope, Francis Levy's blog of rants and reactions to contemporary politics, art and culture}"
3,TASTE,Bourbons For Derby Day! Tequilas for Cinco De Mayo!,"Tony Sachs, ContributorDrinker of Spirits, Listener of Music, Watcher of Baseball, Wr...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bourbons-for-derby-day-te_b_5028384.html,"There's more to life than tequila and bourbon, even on Cinco de Derby weekend. And on May 6, when you're margarita'd and mint julep'd out and are looking for a change of pace, you'll thank me.",2014-04-29,2014-04-28-Bookers_25th_anniversary_10_Year_old_Bourbon.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-04-28-Bookers_25th_anniversary_10_Year_old_Bourbon-thumb.jpg,"I started this piece out by writing about two new tequilas for Cinco de Mayo. Then I realized that it's also Kentucky Derby weekend, and hey, there are some good new bourbons out there as well. And then I tried a few really excellent new rums, a great Japanese whisky, some Chinese baiju, and... what was conceived as a little tequila blog became a global booze extravaganza. So sue me. There's more to life than tequila and bourbon, even on Cinco de Derby weekend. And on May 6, when you're margarita'd and mint julep'd out and are looking for a change of pace, you'll thank me. All these spirits should be generally available, some more so than others (not every Liquor Barn will be carrying a $1,200 rum, for instance). But they're all worth tracking down.BOURBONBOOKER'S 25TH ANNIVERSARY BOURBON (65.4% alcohol by volume, aged 9-11 years, suggested retail price $100). The Booker behind Booker's was Booker Noe, the grandson of Jim Beam and the man who's more responsible than anyone in the industry for changing how bourbon is perceived. A quarter century ago, when he first gave bottles of this small-batch, uncut and unfiltered whiskey to friends and family for Christmas, bourbon was considered bottom-shelf booze. Today, the good stuff is as revered as the best Scotch single malts. And this is indeed the good stuff. Booker Noe died in 2004; his son, Fred Noe (who's followed in his father's footsteps and is doing his legacy proud) is commemorating the 25th anniversary of those first bottles by bottling the last barrels that were laid down by Booker himself. They're 10-11 years old now, older by a few years than standard Booker's. As with any Booker's you'll try, this is a big whiskey. And by big I mean huge, colossal, gargantuan. It explodes with flavor -- caramel, cinnamon, a little cherry, a bit of clove -- and coming in at almost two-thirds alcohol, it packs quite a spicy wallop as well. But since this is some really well-made hooch, it doesn't burn going down, and despite the extra age, it isn't over-oaked. Wherever Booker Noe is now, I hope he's got a bottle of this stuff and a glass.GARRISON BROTHERS TEXAS STRAIGHT BOURBON (47% ABV, aged 2 years, $85). All bourbon must come from Kentucky, right? Wrong! There are several legal requirements for how bourbon has to be made, but location isn't one of them. So let's give a Texas-sized welcome to the first ever bourbon made in the Lone Star State. As with many craft or microdistilleries, Garrison Brothers doesn't age its product for very long, but speeds up the aging process by putting the whiskey in smaller barrels; standard size is 53 gallons, while this stuff mostly rests in 15 gallon barrels. This way, more of the whiskey comes in contact with the wood, and things move a little faster than they normally would. Personally, I wouldn't mind a little more quality time 'twixt the liquid and the oak, but this is far better than a lot of underaged white dog-once-removed swill out there. You can really taste the corn from which it's distilled, but you there's also caramel, cinnamon and brown sugar coming from the barrel. And while it's spicy and tingly, it doesn't burn the way a poorly aged two-year-old can. At $85 a bottle it's on the pricey side, but if you're in an iconoclastic mood on Derby Day, it's worth a shot. TINCUP AMERICAN WHISKEY (42% ABV, aged 4-5 years, $28). The excitement of trying a new American whiskey is always offset by a little bit of trepidation. Is it a well-made product made by experienced distillers or insufficiently aged booze made by a cash-poor former accountant in a loft in Hipsterville? Of course, some fine whiskeys have come out of hipster lofts, and some duds have come from well-regarded distilleries, but you get my drift. Tincup has a reputable pedigree, as it's made by Jess Graber, the same fellow who makes Stranahan's whiskey. A high-rye bourbon, it's distilled in Indiana, aged there for 4-5 years, and then shipped to Colorado, where it's cut with local, mineral-rich water and bottled at the Stranahan's plant. 4-5 years isn't a whole lot of aging, but to my taste buds it doesn't seem like it needs much more. It's sweet and rich with caramel and vanilla to start with. At mid-palate the rye kicks in with a nice cinnamon spiciness. The finish is comparatively dry, with grain and a hint of wood. A big whiskey that never stops evolving on the palate, and one of my faves of the year so far.TEQUILAHORNITOS BLACK BARREL TEQUILA (40% ABV, aged 18 months, $30). Tequila has lost a lot of hip cachet in the last couple of years, eclipsed by its badass agave-based cousin, mezcal. And while a good añejo tequila makes for a very fine sipping spirit, it's never really been considered in the same league with whiskey. So it sort of makes sense that the good folks at Hornitos would try to make a tequila that tastes like whiskey. Sort of. How exactly did they do it? After traditional aging in toasted oak barrels for 12 months, it's moved to deeply charred barrels for four months, and then back to toasted oak barrels for a final two months. And sure enough, it's drier, with a more notes of wood and charcoal, than your standard tequila. Of course, there's no mistaking it for Maker's Mark, either -- the ever-present vanilla and agave flavors make sure of that. So while I wouldn't drink Black Barrel when you're in the mood for a bourbon or rye, it's quite good when you're looking for an aged tequila to quaff. And it does make for a nice change of pace in traditional whiskey cocktails -- try it in a tequila Old Fashioned for starters.1800 MILENIO EXTRA ANEJO TEQUILA (40% ABV, aged 5 years, $125). Here's another experiment with tequila and whiskey, this time from the higher end of the market. Milenio which is a 5-year-old extra añejo (ridiculously old for a tequila) finished for four months in barrels formerly used to age cognac, is so named because it was first released in a very limited run in 2000. Now it's back for all of us who missed it the first time around. Tequila drinkers who go for the spirit's earthy agave notes may be a disappointed, since the time spent in wood has smoothed out the rough edges and tempered the agave somewhat. That said, whether or not it's a delicious tequila, it's a delicious spirit, full of vanilla and oak and fruity brandy notes. A great way to add a touch of class to your Cinco de Mayo celebration.RUMBRUGAL PAPA ANDRES RUM (40% ABV, no age statement, $1,200). When you get down to brass tacks, most consumers still think of rum as the stuff you put in your mojito, rather than a sophisticated sipping spirit. Which is actually great, because it means amazing sipping rums can be had for a fraction of the cost of a comparable single malt. There are a few pricey exceptions, however, the latest of which is this beauty from Brugal, the distinguished Dominican rum producer. Named after the founder of the company, Papa Andres comes from what used to be the family's private reserves. It's a blend of rums from three different kinds of barrels -- ex-sherry, ex-Pedro Ximenez, and first-fill American oak -- and is limited to 500 bottles annually, 70 of which will be sold in the States. Some of the price comes from the fancy-shmancy packaging (stunning crystal decanter in a very handsome box), but this is a high-end rum in the best sense of the word. It's very delicate, taking a couple of sips to really build up a head of steam. Once it gets to cruising speed, you can sense tropical fruits like pineapple, dark fruits (the sherry influence), caramel, and a hint of wood, though less than you'd expect from a rum presented with this much pomp. Is it worth a grand and change? I'm not sure about that, but it's a subtle, immensely pleasurable rum that does the Brugal name proud.DENIZEN MERCHANT'S RESERVE RUM (40% ABV, aged 8 years, $29). Denizen made its bones with a ridiculously cheap and very decent white rum a few years back, but Merchant's Reserve is a horse of a whole 'nuther color. It's a blend of various aged Jamaican pot still rums and Rhum Grande Arome, a molasses-based rum from Martinique which is only made by one distillery (most rum from Martinique is made using cane juice, which is known as rhum agricole). Supposedly, this combo was used by Trader Vic himself for his mai tais -- a most worthy cat to emulate. Indeed, I made what could possibly be the best mai tais of my life with Merchant's Reserve. And I make a pretty mean mai tai. Merchant's Reserve is big, viscous, and sweet with an earthy, funky edge, all of which work great in a mai tai. The rich vanilla and tropical fruit notes temper the tang of the citrus, while the earthiness keeps the sweetness of the orgeat in check. It's full-bodied enough to keep all the other ingredients in line but doesn't overwhelm any of them. And if sipping rums are your bag, it goes nice in a snifter, too. Having a nip of it neat while whipping up a batch of mai tais is highly recommended.SOUTH BAY RUM (40% ABV, no age statement, $28). If you can't swing the price tag for Papa Andres, or even if you can but don't want to crack open the decanter, here's another sensational Dominican rum for, oh, $1,170 less. Blended using the solera method and aged in barrels which formerly held bourbon, sherry, port or single malt Scotch, you can taste elements of all four spirits -- dark fruits from the sherry and port, a whiff of smoke from the Scotch, vanilla and caramel from the bourbon -- all harmonizing as beautifully as a street corner doo-wop group. It's rich and buttery, but dry and woody enough so you know this isn't kid's stuff. If anyone still needs convincing that rum is a sipping spirit as glorious and refined as whisky or cognac, a glass of South Bay (or the Papa Andres, if you're feeling generous) will convert the unconverted.OTHER STUFFBYEJOE RED BAIJU (40% alcohol by volume, not aged, $30). Not familiar with baiju? Then you're obviously not from China, which is responsible for most of the billion-plus cases of the stuff sold each year. Almost none of those sales were in the US, a situation which Byejoe seeks to replicate. Baiju is a clear, sorghum-based spirit which tastes like... well, I'm sure it tastes somewhat different than Byejoe. It purports to be authentic Chinese baiju which, once it reaches Western shores, is further distilled and diluted from 100-120 proof to 80 proof. But even though this is a dumbed-down version of the real thing, it's still pretty interesting. It's closest in flavor to white rum, though the sorghum adds a funkiness familiar to anyone who's had pancakes with sorghum syrup instead of maple syrup or molasses. It's oddly appealing neat, more so on the rocks, and I'll bet it would make a nifty alternative to light white rums like Bacardi in rum cocktails. I can't wait to do an A-B taste test with Byejoe and authentic Chinese baiju... once I can find the real thing.HAKUSHU 18 YEAR OLD SINGLE MALT JAPANESE WHISKY (48% ABV, aged 18 years, $200). Every time I try a good Japanese whisky, I think to myself, ""Self, why don't you drink Japanese whisky more often?"" The answer is simple and slightly pathetic. There's so damn much great whisky (and whiskey) being made all over the world that possessing a working knowledge of even one region of one country is a pretty big deal. So for me at least, Japan and its whisky is a Pandora's box that I'm a little bit intimidated to open. That said, Hakushu 18, made by the folks at Suntory and making its American debut after being on the Japanese market for several years, is tremendous. Compare it to Hakushu's 12 year old bottling (maybe my favorite Japanese whisky) to see what a difference six extra years in wood makes. The 12 is luscious, sweet and fruity, while the 18 mutes those flavors somewhat and adds oak, spice and smoke to the mix. The 12 is vibrant, the 18 refined and mellow, and they're both worth your time and money.HIGHLAND PARK FREYA SINGLE MALT SCOTCH WHISKY (51.2% ABV, aged 15 years, $275). I used to think that the Valhalla collection -- a series of four whiskies created to honor the Norse gods that were once worshipped on the Orkney islands where Highland Park's distillery is located -- was rather silly and far-fetched. But Thor and Loki, the first two in the series, are no joke, even if their bottles are housed in what looks like a Viking funerary ark. The third up is Freya, the goddess of fertility and motherhood as well as the goddess of the Norse version of the afterlife. You'd expect a whisky made with her in mind to be multi-dimensional, and that's exactly what Freya is. It comes on surprisingly sweet, all honey and apples and pears and apricots, but peppery spice and oaky notes quickly come to the fore. The finish is short, dry and intense. Whether or not you care about the mythology associated with Freya, this is a truly astonishing whisky -- the best of the Valhalla Collection so far and some of the best booze I've tried this year, period. Hoarders take note, this is a limited edition. It costs a pretty penny, but it's well worth it."

The interplay of human emotion that washes over your companion's face is amazing. It has the complexity of a glass of wine. It is a subtle blend of panic and distress, with notes of nausea and hints of anguish. You can see the flashback to those torturous days of high school physics play across the person's face with more clarity than anything you will watch on the in-flight entertainment system.Avoiding this exact look was one of the main reasons that I agreed to spend the last five years being filmed for a documentary about particle physics called Particle Fever. Opening up your life to a camera crew is intrusive, but I did so because I am determined to see one major myth broken: that physics means math. While it is true that a certain level of math is required in physics courses, and that some physicists use lots of math, a career in physics by no means enslaves you to a life of scribbling Greek letters on a chalkboard. I am an experimental physicist, and with 3,000 of my fellow colleagues, I helped build the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider, which is the size of a five-story building, encompasses 100 million electronic channels and has more than 1,800 miles of cable. To build this detector, 38 countries had to agree to the micrometer. The Large Hadron Collider (photo courtesy of CERN)My daily work life has involved a mixture of thinking about the big questions (like how can we use this detector to search for dark matter particles), international relations (like managing a group of French, Russians, Georgians, Brazilians, Swedes, Italians and Americans) and large-scale project management (for example, we have 5,000 feet of cable that has to be run by next Tuesday). Zero math. As a student, I hated physics for the same reason that most people do: It was boring. High school physics was a drag. In college I took physics begrudgingly, and hated that too. So what sold me on physics in the end? I needed cash, so I answered an advertisement for a summer job in a physics lab assembling electronics for a ground-based gamma-ray experiment. It was love at first sight. The lab was a combination of the energy of Steve Jobs' cluttered garage together with shiny and new electronics machinery. But what caught me was not the lab or the high-tech tools; it was the designing a complex machine in order to answer fundamental questions of nature. This was the ""big questions"" stuff. And I loved it. After that summer I immediately changed my major to physics, took the minimal number of physics courses (so minimal, in fact, that I almost failed to graduate), and spent the rest of my time in the lab. In other words, I suffered through the math so that I could do physics.I consider myself lucky because if I hadn't answered that random advertisement, I wouldn't be a physicist today. And my experience is not unique: Many of my colleagues also came to the field through one of its many back doors. So how do we change the image of a physicist so that people, especially middle- and high-school students, have a better idea of what a career in physics means? Big media projects like Particle Fever are definitely exciting and mind-blowing and have the potential to reach large audiences, but change doesn't have to come from the national level. Many times, change is most effective eye-to-eye. For parents and teachers, talk to the researchers at your local universities or businesses. Ask if a student can spend one day or one week in the lab. And don't send the student whose science project always wins; send the student whose project is second or third but who doesn't think that he or she wants to pursue a career in science. For my fellow researchers in both academics and industry, talk to your local schools. Give a talk to describe the cutting edge of research in your field. Invite some students into the workplace. Of the dozen or so students who have spent a week in my lab, four of them have told me later that that experience was pivotal in their decision to pursue science. Even the smallest moment can lead to a big change in perception, and on that airplane, it could be the difference between ""I hated physics"" and ""I spent time at the coolest lab!"""

Contemporary outlooks will have us living in truth. This new perspective of success has to include the intangibles of happiness and purpose.

Held at the beautiful New York City Center, the affair promised to be something more than your average hotel conference.A mixture of performance, discussion and inspiring keynotes held the audience's attention over two days. It's impossible to recap the entirety of the experience in a few paragraphs. Each attendee took away something of personal resonance, but here are a few quotable moments that spoke to me. 1. ""I realized you can complete a project by dropping it."" -- Arianna HuffingtonHow often do you force yourself to finish something in which you have absolutely no interest? It's one thing to leave others in a bind by refusing to meet your commitments. It's quite another to change your mind when you are clear something is not priority, and the world's fate is probably not at risk. This was a great reminder that you have the option to simply say no. 2. ""Know your value and you'll get that value."" -- Lucy DanzigerThis presents a challenge for many people. Knowing your worth is crucial to everything else you experience in your life. The truth is, whatever you accept in life will continue. When you are clear on your worth, you will not tolerate anything that does not measure up. In addition, you will also attract people and opportunities that reflect your belief.3. ""Reclaim our bodies as sacred."" -- Latham Thomas  We place valuables in safety deposit boxes. We even get sturdy cases for our precious phones. If only we treated our spirits with the same fervor. Our bodies house the most precious thing of all and yet we often treat them with disregard. We need to recognize the wonders of the human body and the highest role it plays. After all, what can be more sacred than the thing that houses the most sacred thing of all, our spirits? 4. ""The real meditation practice is how we live from moment to moment."" -- Jon Kabat-ZinnMeditation is often thought of as a routine, but it extends far beyond the designated time in which it is performed. Just as physical exercise helps overall functioning of the body, meditation sets the tone for moving through the world. The beauty of meditation is the awareness you carry back with you for the other hours of the day when you aren't actively meditating. The power of meditation isn't really in the doing, it's in the being. 5. ""[Being] cynical is the protection against the vulnerability of being open."" -- Alanis Morissette Every cynical person you've ever met clearly falls under this category. It's more important to examine where you have been cynical in your thoughts. Vulnerability often disguises itself when it plays out in our own lives. It's easy to recognize in others but takes much more self-discernment to see it for what it is. Check your inner cynic for its true origin.6. ""Liberation is the acceptance of one's self and one's life as it is."" -- Panache DesaiPerhaps you are held hostage by the nagging voice in your head that constantly critiques you.
