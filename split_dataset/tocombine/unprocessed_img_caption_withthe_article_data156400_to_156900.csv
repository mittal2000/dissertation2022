One bitter evening on April 30, 1976, in an auditorium in downtown San Francisco, my family and I sang it to mark our first anniversary in exile. The first of a handful of Vietnamese songs penned abroad after the end of a war that spurred an unprecedented exodus, Oh Mother Vietnam was sung the way a people who had just lost a country would sing it; that is, with tears in our eyes and a cry in our voices. Some in the audience, I remember, even wore white headbands, the kind worn at some funerals to mourn the dead.  Vietnamese refugees escaping a fallen Saigon in 1975.  Nearly four decades have passed since then. If I were to sing it now, not that I remember the lyrics entirely, I would sing it with a tone full of irony. So removed from that emotional juncture, I wonder to what extent is the song's declaration still true? Vietnam is accessible now to the Diaspora, but to what extent are we still here for her? Who, in fact, are we?In his book Tribes: How Race, Religion and Identity Determine Success in the New Global Economy, Joel Kotkin describes a quintessentially cosmopolitan global tribe as an international community that combines a strong sense of a common origin with ""two critical factors for success in the modern world: geographic dispersion and a belief in scientific progress."" Kotkin's primary examples include the British, Jews, Chinese, Japanese, and Indians. These groups, relying on mutual dependence and trust, created global networks that allow them ""to function collectively beyond the confines of national or regional borders."" In subsequent writings, Kotkin has added Vietnamese to his list. The Trip to Orange CountyMore than four million Vietnamese have fled or migrated abroad since the end of the Fall of Saigon in 1975. They have re-established themselves elsewhere, scattered on five continents. These days you can find restaurants selling pho, banh mi, and other Vietnamese favorites in South Africa, Brazil, Dubai, and beyond. I myself have relatives living in six different countries on three continents. But the largest numbers of the Diaspora ended up in North America, and the largest portion of that population resettled in California, where my family and I, and most of my relatives, now live.Ours is an epic filled with irony: traumatized by wars and bound by old ways of life where land and ancestors are worshipped, where babies' umbilical cords are traditionally buried in the earth as a way to bind them to the ancient land, we relocated to a country known for its fabulous fantasies, high-tech wizardry, and individualistic ambition. Take, for example, this bus trip I am on. A comfortable bus going south, with the nostalgic music of Trinh Cong Son, sung by the smoky-voiced Khanh Ly, echoing from the overhead speaker. Son was the most famous Vietnamese composer during the Vietnam War, the master of love and antiwar songs, and Khanh Ly the most famous singer. The two old Vietnamese ladies next to me are bragging about their children and their grandchildren, and how well they're doing, and so on. Behind me, a couple of middle-aged men are humming along with this song of their youth. And up front two kids are playing handheld computer games while their mother talks endlessly on her cell to someone about her restaurant business.Vietnamese voices rise and fall; I close my eyes and listen. I swear I could be in Hue heading south to Saigon or Dalat.Except, I am not. I am on the other side of the Pacific, on my way from San José to Orange County, going down Interstate 5 in a Vietnamese-owned bus. It is owned by one of three competing Vietnamese companies, which speaks to the infrastructure of our ethnic community in America. One of the two old ladies comments that she cannot get over the fact that her son and grandchildren live in a big house on a hill in Freemont, California. ""To think my son back home wore shorts and played in the rice field, and all my kids studied by lamplight. Now, he's a big shot engineer. It's so different, our lives, all these machines,"" she says and looks out to the verdant knolls that blur past us. Then, instead of being relieved, she sighs and says in a voice full of nostalgia, ""We've come so far from home."" When I think of the Vietnamese narrative in America, I think of my mother's ancestral altar. In her suburban home on the outskirts of San José with a pool shimmering in the backyard, my mother prays. Every morning she climbs a chair and piously lights a few joss sticks for the ancestral altar on top of the living room bookcase and mumbles her solemn prayers to the dead. Black and white photos of grandpa and grandma and uncles stare out benevolently to the world of the living from the top shelf. On the shelves below, by contrast, stand my father's MBA diploma, my older siblings' engineering and business degrees, my own degree in biochemistry, our combined sports trophies, and, last but not least, the latest installments of my own unending quest for self-reinvention-- plaques and obelisk crystals and framed certificates, my literary and journalism awards.What mother's altar and the shelves tell is the story of the Vietnamese American conversion, one where Old World Fatalism meets New World Optimism, the American Dream. After all, praying to the dead is a cyclical, Confucian habit--one looks to the past for guidance, and one yearns toward that ""common origin"" to keep him connected to his community, his sense of continuity. Getting awards and trophies, on the other hand, is an American tendency, a proposition of ascendancy, where one looks toward the future and deems it optimistic and bright. So Mother Vietnam, we have survived but we have irrevocably changed. To be Vietnamese American, one learns to lurk between these two opposite ideas, negotiating, that is, between night and day.Under California's cerulean sky the newcomers undergo a marvelous transformation. In the Golden State where half a million Vietnamese resettled, dreams do have a penchant of coming true. The newcomer grows ambitious. He sees, for instance, his own restaurant in the ""For Rent"" sign on a dilapidated store in a run-down neighborhood. He sees his kids graduating from top colleges. He imagines his own home with a pool in the back five years down the line--things that were impossible back home.Day and night, indeed. The traumas of the initial expulsion and the subsequent exodus--re-education camps under communist rules, thirst and starvation on the high seas, years languishing in refugee camps, the horror of Thai pirates and unforgiving storms--are over the years replaced by the jubilation of a new-found status and, for some, enormous wealth. A community that initially saw itself as living in exile, as survivors of some historical blight, has gradually changed its self-assessment. It began to see itself as an immigrant community, as a thriving Little Saigon, with all sorts of make-it-rich narratives.  Sister, did you know the man who created the famous Sriracha chili sauce was a boat person? He arrived in America in January of 1980 and by February already started making his famous green-capped bottles of hot sauce. Now his company rolls out ten million bottles plus a year. It's the next Ketchup. He's a very rich man.Aunty, do you know that the man who started Lee's sandwiches started out with just a food truck? He parked outside electronics assembly plants in San José selling sandwiches to mostly Vietnamese workers, but he parlayed his business into a multi-million dollar chain. There are now Lee's sandwiches shops in California, Arizona, and Texas, not to mention China, Korea, and Vietnam itself. It's an international corporation.Brother, have you heard about the assistant to the attorney general in the George W. Bush administration? He was a boat person and left Vietnam at age fifteen but graduated magna cum laude from Harvard Law School and was editor of Harvard Law Review. He was the chief architect of the USA Patriot Act. Can you believe it?Soon enough houses are bought, jobs are had, children are born, old folks are buried, businesses and malls are opened, community newspapers are printed, and economic and political organizations are formed. That is to say, ours is a community whose roots are burrowing, slowly but deeply, into the American loam. The pangs of longing and loss are thus dulled by the necessities of living and by the glory of newfound status and wealth. And the refugee-turned-immigrant (a psychological transition) becomes a naturalized U.S. citizen (more or less a transition of convenience) and finds that the insistence of memories insists a little less as he zooms down the freeway toward a glorious chimerical cityscape to work each morning. To be a Viet Kieu  We fled abroad and changed, and we in turn developed extraordinary influence back home. The rich, well-fed Vietnamese abroad sent gifts and letters home, kept impoverished relatives fed. They sent pictures of themselves. ""See, Tree Hang and Hien? They're Helen and Henry now. Aren't they so tall? It's the American milk and peanut butter, you know. They make your bones large and strong. Henry has a PhD. And Brother, look... ""The relatives devoured the photographs with their eyes. Beyond those handsome, smiling young adults who pose with such ease next to their sports cars is, inevitably, that two-story house with its two-car garage, as if in mockery. During the Cold War, like sirens, such images were the final tug that lured some Vietnamese from their shantytown toward the open sea.So much yearning for America changes the character of Vietnam itself. Vuot bien--to cross the border--became a household verb in Vietnam in the 80s. Viet Kieu--literally ""overseas Vietnamese,"" people of Vietnamese origin now living abroad--became a powerful symbol in the 80s and 90s for all Vietnamese of their potential, the future. And it is universally understood that the Viet Kieu, with their wealth and influence, can change the fortune of their poor cousins. Returning Vietnamese expats at the Tan Son Nhat Airport  Until a decade or so ago, Vietnam's narrative of herself was that she's four thousand years old. Her milk is dry, her hair gray, she suffers from astigmatism. She has little to offer her numerous children. America, on the other hand, is young, rich, and optimistic: everything that Vietnam cannot be. Vietnamese, increasingly a younger population and full of yearning, inevitably dream of America, a place they imagine of peace, freedom, and wealth, and of little suffering.For let it be noted that, despite the horror and bloodshed of the war, the Vietnamese missed the Americans after they abandoned the country. Stepping over broken wings of warplanes and moss-covered fragments of rusty old tanks, young Vietnamese search for America. The American relics offer wondrous possibilities. Assemble the broken parts and you might end up with a car, a bridge, or even a homemade factory. Dig up some missing bones and crown the assemblage with an MIA's dog tags and, who knows, you might turn it into a coveted treasure, an American GI's bones, to be sold to Americans for a lot of money.A few years ago, I went back to Vietnam to participate in a PBS documentary, and I did the touristy thing: I went to the Cu Chi Tunnel in Tay Ninh Province, bordering Cambodia, the underground labyrinth where the Viet Cong hid during the war.There were a handful of American vets in their sixties. They were back for the first time. They were very emotional. One wept and said that, during the war, ""I spent a long time looking for this place and lost friends doing the same.""But the young tour guide told me that it was tourism that forced the Vietnamese to dig up the old hideouts. She, however, did not see the past. She crawled through the same tunnel with foreigners routinely but she emerged with different ideas. Her head is filled with the Golden Gate Bridge and cable cars and two-tiered freeways and Hollywood and Universal Studios. ""I have many friends over there now,"" she said, her eyes dreamy, reflecting the collective desire of Vietnamese youth. ""They invite me to come. I'm saving money for this amazing trip."" If she could, she told me, she would go and study in America.Here's a young woman who looks at a tunnel that was the headquarters of the Viet Cong and the target of massive bombings years ago and what does she see? The Magic Kingdom. The Cu Chi Tunnel leads some to the past surely, but for the young tour guide it may very well lead to the future.After the Cold War ended, Vietnamese refugees were no longer welcome in the West, and, as forced repatriation became more or less a new international policy, boat people stopped coming. But the migration did not stop. In fact, it continues to this day, albeit in a more orderly fashion. Relatives sponsor relatives, Vietnamese marry Vietnamese Americans, political and religious prisoners and Vietnamese Amerasians come under the U.S. special programs, and, the latest wave, well-to-do and bright Vietnamese foreign students apply to study in the U.S., and children of the ruling class of Hanoi and Saigon (now called Ho Chi Minh City)--all are hopeful for a new beginning in America. A Bar on Truong Han Sieu Street  It sometimes seems almost inevitable in the twenty-first century that the refugee becomes an immigrant and the immigrant, if he fares well, becomes cosmopolitan, with multiple languages and cultural-geographical affiliations. And it's inevitable, too, for many a Vietnamese abroad that at some point he takes the journey home.Consider this National Public Radio story two years ago that began thus: ""Many Vietnamese who fled the communist takeover have returned as visitors since, but none of them as commander of a U.S. guided missile destroyer, one making port in the same city where U.S. combat troops first came ashore in Vietnam in 1965. The symbolism wasn't lost on Commander H.B. Le of the USS Lassen as he spoke to reporters pier side.""Commander Le was five years old when he fled Vietnam in a crowded boat. Returning in his U.S. Navy uniform, he stood a foot taller than the old admirals who saluted him, a former boat person, someone they would have readily arrested three decades earlier if he were caught escaping.Diep Vuong, a cum laude graduate of Harvard University with a degree in economics, left Vietnam as a boat person in 1979, but came back seven years ago to help fight human trafficking in An Giang, her home province in the Mekong Delta. ""I always remember once we came to America my mother saying to my sisters and I that we were born Vietnamese for a reason, and it is up to us to figure out what that reason is,"" she said. Hers is that she can protect at-risk young women being sold into slavery.As the rich-poor gap in Vietnam has widened with the growth of the economy, human trafficking has become a scourge. Vuong's programs are part of the Pacific Links Foundation's effort to empower young women by providing education, skills training, scholarships, and shelter to those at risk. ""Increasingly, Vietnamese Americans are playing central roles in the philanthropy sector,"" she said. ""As for me, I can't just sit and do nothing. Any of those girls being sold to Cambodia or China could be a cousin or a child of an old friend.""Nguyen Qui Duc, a Vietnamese refugee who became an American radio host and the author of the memoir Where the Ashes Are: The Odyssey of a Vietnamese Family, has found yet another incarnation in his late-fifties: as a bar owner and art curator in Hanoi. Why would he come back to the country from which he once fled as a refugee? ""Home is where there's a sense of connection, of family, of community,"" he said after struggling to find a single answer. ""And I found it here.""Duc is one of at least 200,000 Viet Kieu who return to Vietnam yearly, many only to visit relatives and for tourism, but a small portion increasingly to work, invest, and retire. The majority of the people who return are from the United States, where the largest Vietnamese population overseas resides. Indeed, thirty-eight years after the Vietnam War ended, the Vietnamese Diaspora is now falling slowly but surely back into Vietnam's orbit.Not long ago, a Vietnamese overseas had little more than nostalgic memories to keep cultural ties alive. During the Cold War, letters sent from the United States could take half a year to reach their recipients in Vietnam. Today, however, eighteen years after the United States re-established diplomatic ties with Vietnam, and six years after Vietnam joined the World Trade Organization, Hanoi is but a direct flight from Los Angeles, and Vietnamese at home and overseas chat online, text message one another, and video call on Skype. Vietnamese tourists visiting the United States is also increasingly the norm.Overseas Vietnamese play an important role in Vietnam's economic life. According to Vietnam's Chamber of Commerce, in 2008, despite the slowdown in the world economy, Vietnam received overseas aid of more than $7.4 billion. The Vietnamese government said that the Diaspora is reducing poverty and spurring economic development. Official development assistance pledged to Vietnam in 2008 by international donors was $5 billion, whereas the overseas Vietnamese contributed $2.4 billion more.In 2010, the total amount of remittances plus investment funds from the Diaspora, according to the Vietnamese government, had reached $20 billion, or 8 percent of Vietnam's GDP. Hanoi, seeing the Diaspora as a tremendous resource, is even considering granting dual citizenship to Viet Kieus to spur further repatriation. There's another form of Viet Kieu contribution that is not so tangible, but arguably just as important: themselves.Nguyen Qui Duc's bar, Tadioto, an elegant place on Truong Han Sieu Street in Hanoi, has become a gathering place for artists and writers and intellectuals--expatriates and locals alike. Avant-garde art pieces hang on the wall or stand alone in the middle of rooms. ""Public space is not yet what it should be in Vietnam,"" Duc explained. ""I'm aiming to change that--to bring real dialogue between different people.""Each week at Tadioto, Vietnamese-American poets and writers share their experiences with their Vietnamese counterparts. Vietnam has reached an ideological dead end--but, in the private sphere, new political thoughts are being formed. If Vietnam still wears the hammer and sickle on her sleeve, her heart throbs now with commerce and capitalism.There is, along with a fledgling civil society, a growing middle class, and a slow erosion of the political barricade as the pressure rises for political reform, transparency, and pluralism. The return of the Diaspora to the homeland is thus a double-edged sword: Many bring back financial investment and technological know-how. Yet with the presence of so many vocal Viet Kieus in Vietnam, a complex narrative is being formed, one in which knowledge and ideas of the outside world permeate the local culture and society. In this private sphere, and on the Internet, and despite continual arrest of dissident bloggers, the din of political debate and dissent can loudly be heard.In the wake of that bitter civil war and the subsequent exodus is an irony: those persecuted by Uncle Ho's followers for being affiliated with the United States and as ""collaborators"" and forced to flee abroad during the Cold War are now being actively solicited to return to Vietnam to help invest in and rebuild the government that once spurned them. For having international connections in the post-Cold War aftermath is now seen as a good thing.Having been victims of the war, these people with multiple affiliations have emerged as victors of the peace. They've managed to remake themselves and go on with their lives, and more important, by refusing to let rage and thirst for vengeance dominate their hearts, some have become active agents in changing the destiny of Vietnam itself. Traditions and AmbitionsThe reason I am on this bus is this: to see for myself the Vietnam War Memorial in Orange County that I've heard so much about from my parents. My father, once a high-ranking South Vietnamese officer, was on the advisory committee of this memorial-building endeavor. On one evening a decade or so ago, the Vietnamese in Orange County raised more than $200,000 for the memorial. Well-known Vietnamese singers sang for free and ticket receipts all went into the memorial fund. The result was two larger-than-life statues, one depicting a South Vietnamese, the other an American GI, standing side by side in combat fatigues adjacent to the city hall in Westminster, the heart of Orange County's Little Saigon. Vietnam War memorial in Westminster  Standing in front of it, I am of two minds. I feel something akin to patriotism for my long lost homeland stir in my blood as well as a deep sadness for the men who fought and died--and for those who survived but were broken by the experience; I feel, at the same time, a dire need for distance. While I stand there on a Saturday evening, a couple of older women light incense and pray and several older Vietnamese men in army uniforms stand guard nearby. Something somber and heavy in their stance suggests a collective sorrow that causes me to shudder; their eyes--eyes that no doubt saw the worst of the old war--convey anger, hatred, and bitterness. Their faces remind me of my father's.It occurred to me then that while one strand of history still defines those men in army uniforms and, of course, my father, another strand of history was redefining me. My father considers himself an exile living in America, part of an increasingly small population; I see myself as an American journalist who happens to make many journeys to Vietnam without much emotional fanfare. For me, Vietnam, my country of birth, and its tumultuous history have become a point of departure, a concern, but no longer home.The irony is that because he holds Vietnam so dear to his heart, my father cannot return to the country to which he owes allegiance, so long as the current regime remains in power. His is a rage left over from the Cold War that has no end in sight. History, for my father and for those men who still wear their army uniforms at every communal event, has a tendency to run backward, to memories of the war, to a bitter and bloody struggle whose end spelled their defeat and exile. And it holds them static in a lonely nationalist stance. They live in America but their souls are still fighting an unfinished war in Vietnam.The old passion lives on, but it must now contend with the new integration: the Vietnamese Diaspora, no longer in exile, is steadily finding itself in Vietnam's orbit. Lan Nguyen, writing for Nguoi Viet, the largest Vietnamese paper in Orange County, noted that ""While the younger generation of Vietnamese Americans shares with elders a general concern regarding human rights, democracy, and freedom in Vietnam, they are not as invested in the cause."" Nguyen, who lives in San José, cites language barriers and lack of experience under communism as the factors that help widen the generation gap. ""The Vietnamese American youth...often are disillusioned as it seems their every effort to help Vietnam is met with criticism by those older than them. The elders in turn are horrified to see young people organize philanthropic missions to Vietnam."" Photo by artist Binh Danh - Vietnam memories embedded on dead leaves.The question remains whether the Vietnamese Diaspora can be an effective agent of change and find new ways to influence the future of the country. To do so, it needs to ask tough questions. Is there real freedom for those who give in to their hatred and are ruled by it? Is democracy for Vietnam possible when those who live in America often fail to understand and practice it with their own communities, and the majority of those in Vietnam barely show any interest? And what does it take to move beyond anger and lust for revenge, and create space for constructive discussion and dialogue and spur new political thoughts?It is true: once the hate is gone, in its place is pain. Those who cling so strongly to hatred, I suspect, are often those who fear what comes after it. But it is true also that many of us have moved on beyond the old rancor, beyond that us-versus-them mentality. We have learned to absorb our pain and grief and are negotiating our positions between East and West, memories and modernity, traditions and individual ambitions, old loyalties and new alliances, such that we are in the process of recreating a whole notion of what it means to be Vietnamese, a definition that is both open-ended and inclusive.So, Mother Vietnam, in a sense we are still here, but we aren't who we used to be. The new generations born abroad may still behold that sense of common origin, may still take pride in their heritage, but they are not bound by the idea that Vietnam is their destiny. Rather, it's one of their many destinations.A new song is needed, one that describes an individual with multiple affiliations, with additional homelands, someone who shares a sense of common origin but is not bound by collective nationalism. The old umbilical cord, unearthed at last, is transmuted into a new trans-pacific verse, and is an epic in the making.

Aren't they so tall? It's the American milk and peanut butter, you know. They make your bones large and strong. Henry has a PhD. And Brother, look... ""The relatives devoured the photographs with their eyes. Beyond those handsome, smiling young adults who pose with such ease next to their sports cars is, inevitably, that two-story house with its two-car garage, as if in mockery. During the Cold War, like sirens, such images were the final tug that lured some Vietnamese from their shantytown toward the open sea.So much yearning for America changes the character of Vietnam itself. Vuot bien--to cross the border--became a household verb in Vietnam in the 80s. Viet Kieu--literally ""overseas Vietnamese,"" people of Vietnamese origin now living abroad--became a powerful symbol in the 80s and 90s for all Vietnamese of their potential, the future. And it is universally understood that the Viet Kieu, with their wealth and influence, can change the fortune of their poor cousins. Returning Vietnamese expats at the Tan Son Nhat Airport  Until a decade or so ago, Vietnam's narrative of herself was that she's four thousand years old. Her milk is dry, her hair gray, she suffers from astigmatism. She has little to offer her numerous children. America, on the other hand, is young, rich, and optimistic: everything that Vietnam cannot be. Vietnamese, increasingly a younger population and full of yearning, inevitably dream of America, a place they imagine of peace, freedom, and wealth, and of little suffering.For let it be noted that, despite the horror and bloodshed of the war, the Vietnamese missed the Americans after they abandoned the country. Stepping over broken wings of warplanes and moss-covered fragments of rusty old tanks, young Vietnamese search for America. The American relics offer wondrous possibilities. Assemble the broken parts and you might end up with a car, a bridge, or even a homemade factory. Dig up some missing bones and crown the assemblage with an MIA's dog tags and, who knows, you might turn it into a coveted treasure, an American GI's bones, to be sold to Americans for a lot of money.A few years ago, I went back to Vietnam to participate in a PBS documentary, and I did the touristy thing: I went to the Cu Chi Tunnel in Tay Ninh Province, bordering Cambodia, the underground labyrinth where the Viet Cong hid during the war.There were a handful of American vets in their sixties. They were back for the first time. They were very emotional. One wept and said that, during the war, ""I spent a long time looking for this place and lost friends doing the same.""But the young tour guide told me that it was tourism that forced the Vietnamese to dig up the old hideouts. She, however, did not see the past. She crawled through the same tunnel with foreigners routinely but she emerged with different ideas. Her head is filled with the Golden Gate Bridge and cable cars and two-tiered freeways and Hollywood and Universal Studios. ""I have many friends over there now,"" she said, her eyes dreamy, reflecting the collective desire of Vietnamese youth. ""They invite me to come. I'm saving money for this amazing trip."" If she could, she told me, she would go and study in America.Here's a young woman who looks at a tunnel that was the headquarters of the Viet Cong and the target of massive bombings years ago and what does she see? The Magic Kingdom. The Cu Chi Tunnel leads some to the past surely, but for the young tour guide it may very well lead to the future.After the Cold War ended, Vietnamese refugees were no longer welcome in the West, and, as forced repatriation became more or less a new international policy, boat people stopped coming. But the migration did not stop. In fact, it continues to this day, albeit in a more orderly fashion. Relatives sponsor relatives, Vietnamese marry Vietnamese Americans, political and religious prisoners and Vietnamese Amerasians come under the U.S. special programs, and, the latest wave, well-to-do and bright Vietnamese foreign students apply to study in the U.S., and children of the ruling class of Hanoi and Saigon (now called Ho Chi Minh City)--all are hopeful for a new beginning in America. A Bar on Truong Han Sieu Street  It sometimes seems almost inevitable in the twenty-first century that the refugee becomes an immigrant and the immigrant, if he fares well, becomes cosmopolitan, with multiple languages and cultural-geographical affiliations. And it's inevitable, too, for many a Vietnamese abroad that at some point he takes the journey home.Consider this National Public Radio story two years ago that began thus: ""Many Vietnamese who fled the communist takeover have returned as visitors since, but none of them as commander of a U.S. guided missile destroyer, one making port in the same city where U.S. combat troops first came ashore in Vietnam in 1965. The symbolism wasn't lost on Commander H.B. Le of the USS Lassen as he spoke to reporters pier side.""Commander Le was five years old when he fled Vietnam in a crowded boat. Returning in his U.S. Navy uniform, he stood a foot taller than the old admirals who saluted him, a former boat person, someone they would have readily arrested three decades earlier if he were caught escaping.Diep Vuong, a cum laude graduate of Harvard University with a degree in economics, left Vietnam as a boat person in 1979, but came back seven years ago to help fight human trafficking in An Giang, her home province in the Mekong Delta. ""I always remember once we came to America my mother saying to my sisters and I that we were born Vietnamese for a reason, and it is up to us to figure out what that reason is,"" she said. Hers is that she can protect at-risk young women being sold into slavery.As the rich-poor gap in Vietnam has widened with the growth of the economy, human trafficking has become a scourge. Vuong's programs are part of the Pacific Links Foundation's effort to empower young women by providing education, skills training, scholarships, and shelter to those at risk. ""Increasingly, Vietnamese Americans are playing central roles in the philanthropy sector,"" she said. ""As for me, I can't just sit and do nothing. Any of those girls being sold to Cambodia or China could be a cousin or a child of an old friend.""Nguyen Qui Duc, a Vietnamese refugee who became an American radio host and the author of the memoir Where the Ashes Are: The Odyssey of a Vietnamese Family, has found yet another incarnation in his late-fifties: as a bar owner and art curator in Hanoi. Why would he come back to the country from which he once fled as a refugee? ""Home is where there's a sense of connection, of family, of community,"" he said after struggling to find a single answer. ""And I found it here.""Duc is one of at least 200,000 Viet Kieu who return to Vietnam yearly, many only to visit relatives and for tourism, but a small portion increasingly to work, invest, and retire. The majority of the people who return are from the United States, where the largest Vietnamese population overseas resides. Indeed, thirty-eight years after the Vietnam War ended, the Vietnamese Diaspora is now falling slowly but surely back into Vietnam's orbit.Not long ago, a Vietnamese overseas had little more than nostalgic memories to keep cultural ties alive. During the Cold War, letters sent from the United States could take half a year to reach their recipients in Vietnam. Today, however, eighteen years after the United States re-established diplomatic ties with Vietnam, and six years after Vietnam joined the World Trade Organization, Hanoi is but a direct flight from Los Angeles, and Vietnamese at home and overseas chat online, text message one another, and video call on Skype. Vietnamese tourists visiting the United States is also increasingly the norm.Overseas Vietnamese play an important role in Vietnam's economic life. According to Vietnam's Chamber of Commerce, in 2008, despite the slowdown in the world economy, Vietnam received overseas aid of more than $7.4 billion. The Vietnamese government said that the Diaspora is reducing poverty and spurring economic development. Official development assistance pledged to Vietnam in 2008 by international donors was $5 billion, whereas the overseas Vietnamese contributed $2.4 billion more.In 2010, the total amount of remittances plus investment funds from the Diaspora, according to the Vietnamese government, had reached $20 billion, or 8 percent of Vietnam's GDP. Hanoi, seeing the Diaspora as a tremendous resource, is even considering granting dual citizenship to Viet Kieus to spur further repatriation. There's another form of Viet Kieu contribution that is not so tangible, but arguably just as important: themselves.Nguyen Qui Duc's bar, Tadioto, an elegant place on Truong Han Sieu Street in Hanoi, has become a gathering place for artists and writers and intellectuals--expatriates and locals alike. Avant-garde art pieces hang on the wall or stand alone in the middle of rooms. ""Public space is not yet what it should be in Vietnam,"" Duc explained. ""I'm aiming to change that--to bring real dialogue between different people.""Each week at Tadioto, Vietnamese-American poets and writers share their experiences with their Vietnamese counterparts. Vietnam has reached an ideological dead end--but, in the private sphere, new political thoughts are being formed. If Vietnam still wears the hammer and sickle on her sleeve, her heart throbs now with commerce and capitalism.There is, along with a fledgling civil society, a growing middle class, and a slow erosion of the political barricade as the pressure rises for political reform, transparency, and pluralism. The return of the Diaspora to the homeland is thus a double-edged sword: Many bring back financial investment and technological know-how. Yet with the presence of so many vocal Viet Kieus in Vietnam, a complex narrative is being formed, one in which knowledge and ideas of the outside world permeate the local culture and society. In this private sphere, and on the Internet, and despite continual arrest of dissident bloggers, the din of political debate and dissent can loudly be heard.In the wake of that bitter civil war and the subsequent exodus is an irony: those persecuted by Uncle Ho's followers for being affiliated with the United States and as ""collaborators"" and forced to flee abroad during the Cold War are now being actively solicited to return to Vietnam to help invest in and rebuild the government that once spurned them. For having international connections in the post-Cold War aftermath is now seen as a good thing.Having been victims of the war, these people with multiple affiliations have emerged as victors of the peace. They've managed to remake themselves and go on with their lives, and more important, by refusing to let rage and thirst for vengeance dominate their hearts, some have become active agents in changing the destiny of Vietnam itself. Traditions and AmbitionsThe reason I am on this bus is this: to see for myself the Vietnam War Memorial in Orange County that I've heard so much about from my parents. My father, once a high-ranking South Vietnamese officer, was on the advisory committee of this memorial-building endeavor. On one evening a decade or so ago, the Vietnamese in Orange County raised more than $200,000 for the memorial. Well-known Vietnamese singers sang for free and ticket receipts all went into the memorial fund. The result was two larger-than-life statues, one depicting a South Vietnamese, the other an American GI, standing side by side in combat fatigues adjacent to the city hall in Westminster, the heart of Orange County's Little Saigon. Vietnam War memorial in Westminster  Standing in front of it, I am of two minds. I feel something akin to patriotism for my long lost homeland stir in my blood as well as a deep sadness for the men who fought and died--and for those who survived but were broken by the experience; I feel, at the same time, a dire need for distance. While I stand there on a Saturday evening, a couple of older women light incense and pray and several older Vietnamese men in army uniforms stand guard nearby. Something somber and heavy in their stance suggests a collective sorrow that causes me to shudder; their eyes--eyes that no doubt saw the worst of the old war--convey anger, hatred, and bitterness. Their faces remind me of my father's.It occurred to me then that while one strand of history still defines those men in army uniforms and, of course, my father, another strand of history was redefining me. My father considers himself an exile living in America, part of an increasingly small population; I see myself as an American journalist who happens to make many journeys to Vietnam without much emotional fanfare. For me, Vietnam, my country of birth, and its tumultuous history have become a point of departure, a concern, but no longer home.The irony is that because he holds Vietnam so dear to his heart, my father cannot return to the country to which he owes allegiance, so long as the current regime remains in power. His is a rage left over from the Cold War that has no end in sight. History, for my father and for those men who still wear their army uniforms at every communal event, has a tendency to run backward, to memories of the war, to a bitter and bloody struggle whose end spelled their defeat and exile. And it holds them static in a lonely nationalist stance. They live in America but their souls are still fighting an unfinished war in Vietnam.The old passion lives on, but it must now contend with the new integration: the Vietnamese Diaspora, no longer in exile, is steadily finding itself in Vietnam's orbit. Lan Nguyen, writing for Nguoi Viet, the largest Vietnamese paper in Orange County, noted that ""While the younger generation of Vietnamese Americans shares with elders a general concern regarding human rights, democracy, and freedom in Vietnam, they are not as invested in the cause."" Nguyen, who lives in San José, cites language barriers and lack of experience under communism as the factors that help widen the generation gap. ""The Vietnamese American youth...often are disillusioned as it seems their every effort to help Vietnam is met with criticism by those older than them. The elders in turn are horrified to see young people organize philanthropic missions to Vietnam."" Photo by artist Binh Danh - Vietnam memories embedded on dead leaves.The question remains whether the Vietnamese Diaspora can be an effective agent of change and find new ways to influence the future of the country. To do so, it needs to ask tough questions. Is there real freedom for those who give in to their hatred and are ruled by it? Is democracy for Vietnam possible when those who live in America often fail to understand and practice it with their own communities, and the majority of those in Vietnam barely show any interest? And what does it take to move beyond anger and lust for revenge, and create space for constructive discussion and dialogue and spur new political thoughts?It is true: once the hate is gone, in its place is pain. Those who cling so strongly to hatred, I suspect, are often those who fear what comes after it. But it is true also that many of us have moved on beyond the old rancor, beyond that us-versus-them mentality. We have learned to absorb our pain and grief and are negotiating our positions between East and West, memories and modernity, traditions and individual ambitions, old loyalties and new alliances, such that we are in the process of recreating a whole notion of what it means to be Vietnamese, a definition that is both open-ended and inclusive.So, Mother Vietnam, in a sense we are still here, but we aren't who we used to be. The new generations born abroad may still behold that sense of common origin, may still take pride in their heritage, but they are not bound by the idea that Vietnam is their destiny. Rather, it's one of their many destinations.A new song is needed, one that describes an individual with multiple affiliations, with additional homelands, someone who shares a sense of common origin but is not bound by collective nationalism. The old umbilical cord, unearthed at last, is transmuted into a new trans-pacific verse, and is an epic in the making.

I'm talking, of course, about deoxyribonucleic acid -- DNA.",2013-04-28,DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a complex nucleic acid molecule composed of two strands of nucleotides joined together forming a double helix.It is the primary genetic and hereditary material of nearly all living organisms. Forms the basis of chromosomes.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baeb6242200004301db09a4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I recently turned 44. As with all of one's birthdays, a milestone like this is a chance to gaze backward and assess, as well as an opportunity to look to the future and imagine possibilities. As I do this, though, I'm cognizant of a friend who is being celebrated for turning 60 this year. She's been in my life since before I was born, and she will be around long after I've faded into distant memory. But, in the way that humans do when we describe a feature in the natural world, we've assigned to her a birthday based on when we first recognized how special she was. I'm talking, of course, about deoxyribonucleic acid -- DNA, our blueprint, the hardware/software combination that keeps us on the straight and narrow, controlling our development as we grow from fertilized egg to adult, as well as our biological evolution as a species.It's now become commonplace to think of something being ""written in our DNA,"" as if it was a simply a hard drive onto which all of our key biological traits were inscribed. In this sector of the disk we have hair color and the ability to roll one's tongue, while in another we have our risk of heart disease and the likelihood of developing myopia. These traits are shuffled and dealt to our offspring, and they are thus passed down through the generations in an endless digital daisy chain. But is that really how this insanely long molecule (six feet of it packed into nearly every one of our microscopic cells) works?The genome, it turns out, is far more complicated than we first imagined when Watson and Crick described the double helix in 1953. While their discovery (working with colleagues Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins) of the structure of the molecule immediately suggested a way in which it could be copied -- each complimentary strand serving as a template for synthesizing its partner -- the way in which the simple four-nucleotide code was turned into a fruit fly wing or a human nose remained a mystery. In the 60 years since those heady early days we have come a long way toward understanding the way the language of DNA is translated into action by the cellular machinery, but we still have a long way to go.What have we learned recently? The announcement of the draft sequence of the human genome in 2000 (and its completion in 2003) marked a significant milestone. For the first time we had a roadmap of our genetic material, even if we didn't understand what most of the key geographic features were and why they were there. The next step came with the first systematic description of human genetic variation in the HapMap project. It is variation in our DNA that underlies many of the biological traits that distinguish us. The massive increase in the power of DNA sequencing over the past several years has yielded thousands of new human genomes for researchers to pore over. They have revealed a wealth of new information about the genetic basis of complex human traits, but the glut of data has also shown how truly complex these traits are. Among other fascinating recent results, it seems that there are more rare genetic variants in the human population than there should be -- likely a consequence of the huge explosion in human population size over the past several thousand years. These rare, poorly understood variants may play a role in our predisposition to diseases like diabetes and hypertension, underlining the fact that there is still much remaining to be discovered even a decade after ""completing"" the human genome.It is perhaps fitting that as we apply the latest technology to learn more about our genetic future, we are also gaining ever more insights into our past. DNA is, after all, a historical document -- through our inherited patterns of variation, our genome contains a record of who our ancestors were and where they lived. It contains unexpected stories -- tales of trysts with Neanderthal cousins in Europe and Asia tens of thousands of years ago, for instance -- as well as more mundane details about how you are related to your great-grandparents. More than anything else, though, it has revealed how closely connected we all are to each other. Our species originated in Africa around 200,000 years ago, and it is only in the past 60,000 years or so that we have spread from this continent to populate the world. The superficial characteristics that distinguish people around the globe have arisen quite recently -- only in the past 2,000 human generations or so. When you look at our DNA, we truly are a human family. If it can teach us this simple truth, DNA really has done something amazing."

Losses like his change the world. On March 14, 2007, two ne'er do wells, Joseph ""Smiley"" Beardon, and William ""Bill-Bill"" Brown slit his throat, stabbed him 20 times, dumped his body on a dark, rural road, stole and tried to fence his new car, and then unable to get any money for it, botched an attempt to burn up the vehicle on a boat ramp at Lake Pansy. They said their motive was to rid the world of ""another faggot.""Ryan was deeply loved by his mom, Pat, stepdad, Lynn, older brother, Damien, and a whole host of friends. He also left a brokenhearted lover and two distraught housemates who loved him like a brother. Lies on the part of the killers, and compound falsehoods by the Sheriff of Polk County kept Ryan's murder from reaching the world as it should have. Other LGBTQ lives were lost because Ryan's full story was suppressed by rumor, unsubstantiated allegations about his character, and crass, anti-gay politics. His parents took up the cause of justice for their son, and have become two of the most effective advocates for LGBTQ equality and anti-bullying in America. Beardon and Brown were separately convicted, and are now serving life in prison. Nothing takes the sting of loss away, but many good people have stepped into the breach to ensure that Ryan will never be forgotten, and that his death will not be in vain. Lesbian Filmmakers Vicki Nantz and Mary Meeks produced and filmed a 72-minute documentary about Skipper's murder entitled Accessory to Murder: Our Culture's Complicity in the Death of Ryan Skipper, that premiered in January 2008. In 2011, Ryan's story was published in a book dedicated to keeping the memories of LGBTQ Hate Crimes Murder Victims alive and before the public, entitled Unfinished Lives: Reviving the Memories of LGBTQ Hate Crimes Victims (Resource Publications). The Gay American Heroes Foundation has memorialized Ryan, as well, and seeks to include him in a national monument to the victims of LGBTQ Hate Crimes.But by far the most wonderful remembrance of Ryan has been carried out by his older brother Damien and wife, who gave Ryan's name to their baby girl. Uncle Ryan now has a living memorial in the person of his thriving, laughing, vital niece, Ryan Skipper. The story of Ryan Keith Skipper is, like the stories of so many other anti-gay murder victims throughout the nation, a story of life, not death. Every time little niece Ryan runs and plays, or anyone retells the story of her Uncle Ryan, the intentions of his killers to obliterate his memory and terrorize the LGBTQ community is foiled again. We must remember Ryan and all the other 13,000 women, men and youth whose lives were cut short by irrational hatred today, not in sorrow, but in gratitude -- and in dedication to the spread of justice and equality for all people, gay, transgender, bisexual, and straight alike. Rest peacefully, Ryan, and the thousands like you. We have not forgotten. For we who believe in Justice cannot rest. We who believe in Justice cannot rest until it comes!"

""Austerity is having a devastating effect.""Previous studies by Stuckler published in journals such as The Lancet and the British Medical Journal have linked rising suicide rates in some parts of Europe to biting austerity measures, and found HIV epidemics to be spreading amid cutbacks in services to vulnerable people.But Stuckler and Basu said negative public health effects are not inevitable, even during the worst economic disasters.Using data from the Great Depression of the 1930s, to post-communist Russia and from some examples of the current economic downturn, they say financial crises can be prevented from becoming epidemics - if governments respond effectively.As an example, they say, Sweden's active labour market programmes helped the numbers of suicides to fall there during its recession, despite a big rise in unemployment. Neighbouring countries with no such programmes saw large increases in suicides.And during the 1930s depression in the United States, each extra $100 of relief spending from the American New Deal led to about 20 fewer deaths per 1,000 births, four fewer suicides per 100,000 people and 18 fewer pneumonia deaths per 100,000 people.""Ultimately what we show is that worsening health is not an inevitable consequence of economic recessions. It's a political choice,"" Basu said in the statement. (Reporting by Kate Kelland; Editing by Stephen Powell)"

Known for his rich blue pigments and proclivity for sponges, the French Nouveau realisme artist would turn 85 if he were still with us today.Fans of the great monochromatic painter know Klein's work was based in an obsession with pure beauty and aesthetic, a fixation that often resulted in minimalist canvases doused in the artist's signature International Klein Blue. Working in a period predating the Pop Art explosion, his sponge reliefs and baren oceans of color were a refreshing taste of unadulterated art, that mystified and awed Parisian collectors and critics alike. The popular art critic Pierre Restany held Klein in high regard, proclaiming in a 1967 exhibition text: ""To all those intoxicated with the machine and the big city, to the frenetics of rhythm, masturbated by reality, Yves offers a highly enriching cure of asthenic silence.""Beyond his blue masterpieces, Klein worked in a wide range of art-making, including photomontage and conceptual installations, at one time exhibiting an empty space he so cleverly titled ""The Void."" Whether he was live performance painting or creating an avant-garde symphony, he operated with a coy, determined attitude, once begging the world, ""May all that emerges from me be beautiful."" Sadly his carrer ended when he died of a heart attack at the age of 34, cutting short the enigmatic artist's wild run with fame.Following his death, Klein's legacy ran the gamut of post-mortem criticism, as contemporary writes attempted to pick apart the mysterious artist's oeuvre. Robert Smith of The New York Times characterized him back in 2006 as a "" complicated creature, given to hyperbole, adept at self-mythology, guided by an overweening narcissism and full of contradictions."" This sentiment of challenging Klein's larger-than-life reputation was echoed by The New Yorker's Peter Schjeldahl, who in 2010 wrote, ""In my settled view, Klein was great, perhaps, but not all that good. His poses, while retaining a certain mythic charge, confirmed him as a poseur.""Scroll through the slideshow below for a taste of Klein's bold masterpieces and let us know what you think of Klein's work in the comments.

(Photo by Renee Nowytarger/Newspix/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafb4af260000e9008156bc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When he came out in 2006, it caused headlines. When he talked about his life as a gay man, it sparked national debate. His family disowned him. In the streets of India, he was burned in effigy. In America, Oprah Winfrey invited him to talk to the world about his experiences as a royal prince of the ancient state of Rajpipla and coming out in a modern India.Prince Manvendra Singh Gohil's coming out may not amount to much to a casual observer from afar, but in India, a country with distressingly few out gay and lesbian icons in popular culture (including, and especially, Bollywood), it was a pivotal event. In fact, it was scandalous. That was, in part, because the prince's revelation flew in the face of several widely held misconceptions about being gay in India, where homosexuality is persistently tied to class and economic status. Being gay is often considered a perversion prevalent in slums. A gay Indian prince is more than just an anomaly. For many, it is categorically unthinkable. In contemporary India, his revelation shattered another illusion as well. Homosexuality is cast as a Western import, something ""other"" than Indian. The trouble was that the prince did not go to a school in the United States or Europe. In fact, he did not travel outside India until after he came out to his country.Here, Prince Manvendra talks about what it was like to speak the unspeakable -- and about everything that has followed: the wrath of the people who loved him, their eventual acceptance, Oprah's invitation, the culture of New York's Fire Island and his organization Lakshya Trust, which has been changing lives and attitudes in India since then.Nish Gera: I'm sure this is a question you've answered many times. What was the coming-out experience like? You did it back when being gay was technically illegal in India. How did you do it, and what were some of the immediate reactions?Prince Manvendra: Well, I was fed up with living a double life, pretending to be straight. Moreover, marriage pressures were mounting on me for a second marriage after the failure of the first one. I happen to be the only legal heir to the throne of Rajpipla, and so there were a lot of expectations from the people of Rajpipla. I had been working on gay issues since 1995, and I wasn't satisfied with the acceptance level in our society. And then there is the common misconception in Indian society that being gay is tied to class and economic status. All this triggered me to take this step. I opened Pandora's box and was certain that my coming out publicly would spark a discussion on subjects which have always been taboo and connected to stigma and discrimination in the Indian society. The whole coming-out experience felt as if a huge burden of falsehood was released from my shoulder. I came out through the front-page headline of a local newspaper, which is supposed to be supported by a Hindu fundamentalist party. It was 14th of March 2006, and it triggered a virtual earthquake all over India. The immediate reaction was that my effigies were burned by the local people of Rajpipla, who shouted slogans in public to strip me of my title and to outcaste me and bar me from being invited for public functions. Gera: How have you seen things change in India since Section 377 (the archaic British-era law criminalizing homosexuality) was repealed in 2009?Prince Manvendra: The repeal of Section 377 was so widely publicized that most Indians didn't even know there was a law criminalizing homosexuality. However, it triggered lots of debates on TV that started to bring homosexuality to the mainstream conversation in society. It helped society to understand the issues involving gay people, which increased the acceptance level.Gera: Isn't it a problem that there isn't a word for ""gay"" in Hindi?Prince Manvendra: The word ""gay"" in India is seen as a Western import. There are homosexuals who don't identify themselves as gay men. There is an entire coded secret language spoken, in that there are words for ""active,"" ""passive"" and ""versatile"" too. However, the literal translation of ""homosexual"" in the Hindi language is ""Sumlaingik."" ""Sum"" means ""same,"" and ""laingik"" means ""sexual.""Gera: A huge number of gay men and women in India are married to people of the opposite sex. What is life like for them?Prince Manvendra: Our survey has shown that almost 75 percent of gay men in India are married to women. Most of these marriages are forced and arranged by parents, largely through emotional blackmail. They are forced to live a dual life, and when it goes beyond their control, the marriages end in divorce. Because of this pressure to get married, many gay people attempt suicide or suffer from depression and other mental health problems.Gera: I heard about the project for female partners of gay men that you are involved in. Tell us more about that.Prince Manvendra: My organization Lakshya Trust was the first organization to start working with wives of gay men. It all started when we were doing a RCH (reproductive child health) project and one of the wives confided in us that she knew her husband is gay. Now we employ several women as our peer educators, who educate similar women on issues of being married to gays. Most women have told us that they are secure if their husbands are gay so long as they are giving them physical, mental and financial security. They prefer that their husbands go to men and not to women, since their male counterpart can never get pregnant and, since gay marriage is not legal in India, their marriage is safe. Due to overpopulation in India, lots of families undergo family planning operations so that they can't bear children, and in the absence of condom usage, wives are at a greater health risk if their gay husbands have had unprotected sex with their boyfriends. We do a lot of counseling and partner treatment for sexually transmitted infections for these women.Gera: How was it being on Oprah? Do you think that helped change perceptions about gay people in India, given that Oprah has quite a viewership in India as well?Prince Manvendra: The invitation by Oprah was a turning point in my life. It greatly influenced the perception of a lot of people in our society who are her fans, and they realized that they must start rethinking issues related to homosexuality.Gera: What is the role that Bollywood can play to change attitudes?Prince Manvendra: Bollywood is very popular in Indian society, and lots of actors are considered as role models and icons. Bollywood has started changing its role toward homosexuality. Initially it used to portray gays as jesters or objects of ridicule. Nowadays more serious gay issues are being portrayed on the screen. This will surely help mainstreaming homosexuality in Indian society.Gera: How was it being on Fire Island for the first time?Prince Manvendra: Fire Island actually set me on ""fire""! I had heard lots about it, but experiencing it made me realize why it is called Fire Island. For the first time I experienced complete freedom and no need or desire to be ""undercover.""Gera: Tell us about the Lakshya Trust.Prince Manvendra: Lakshya Trust is the first community-based organization in the state of Gujarat in western India, which was started by a group of four friends to work on gay issues. It is being funded and supported by the Department of Health and the government of Gujarat for HIV prevention and awareness amongst the gay and transgender population. It has three branches with almost 250 full-time and part-time staff, and it has reached out to more than 10,000 people. It was honored with the prestigious Civil Society Awards by UNAIDS in 2006 for outstanding contribution towards HIV control. It also works on other gay issues, such as mental health issues, empowerment, care and treatment of persons living with HIV/AIDS, old age issues, etc. For more information, one can visit lakshya-trust.org.Prince Manvendra is expanding his work into America and the rest of the world through Ekta Transglobal Foundation, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit.

Three days after the tragic Boston Marathon explosions, I was teaching a class at California State University, Los Angeles when the flashing lights and loud sounds of the alarm led me to stop a video I was showing and make sure everyone got out of the classroom before I did. Although I figured we'd be coming back in from what was either a drill or minor incident, I decided to scoop up my belongings and head out right behind the students.When we got outside, a security officer on a motorcycle rode through the pedestrian plaza, telling us all to go to our cars and leave the campus. While driving out at a snail's pace, I heard sirens and saw a police vehicle go by with ""Bomb and K-9 Squad"" on the side. It began to click in that this was not a drill. In order to stay calm, I started to ""CLICK"" -- a process that helped me shift from being disoriented and close to having a panic attack, to being centered and shifting into a better state of awareness.Here are the keys to CLICK that I found myself using as this emergency unfolded. Any one or all of these processes can work in navigating the uncertainty and fear that an evacuation or any emergency can precipitate. Here's the ""Bomb Threat 101"" lesson for what goes into CLICK and how I used it to stay present in the crisis:C is for Calm. As my breathing got shallow, I remembered how important deep breathing is. I take a deep breath into the nose, then release it through the mouth. Also known as ""belly breathing,"" I picked this up in training from the Center for Mind-Body Medicine.L is for Lovingkindness. Repeating a set of phrases, first for the self and then to others, is very centering. I practiced a variation of a lovingkindness meditation from Jack Kornfeld: ""May I be filled with lovingkindness. May I be safe from inner and outer dangers. May I be well in body and mind. May I be at ease and happy.""I is for Inspiration. Thinking of someone who has managed to live through adversity helps give perspective in the face of the unknown. I immediately imagined how a friend who is a Holocaust survivor felt during the many times she was evacuated from buildings during World War II. My own fears of what could happen before I was safely away from campus were quelled by the thought that if she could survive the horrors of the Holocaust, I could envision myself managing the unknown I was facing.C is for Connection. As I left campus, the next decision was... Where to go next? By the time I was beyond the swirl of cars all trying to exit at once, I knew I needed to eat and rather than go home, I went to a health food store that served lunch and was operated by an Israeli. Fortunately the owner was there and we had a chance to talk about terrorism and how Israelis live with it as a fact of life. I actually felt comforted being able to talk with someone who could relate to what I experienced.K is for Kirtan. In my CD player I happened to be listening to a chant of a mantra for protection from a kundalini yoga festival earlier in the day, and put it on again. ""Aad Guray Nameh,"" sung live by Gurunam Singh at a festival organized by Spirit Voyage, helped me feel that I was safe and not alone -- the chanting (kirtan, in the Sanskit language) was calming, enhancing my state of calm I had already established.The good news is that there was no bomb, and I now know that I have an ""inner plan"" that works for me and I can share when facing fearful events like a bomb threat or natural disaster. Extending the lovingkindness meditation, ""May we all be free from inner and outer dangers!""Connie Corley, Ph.D. is a Professor at Fielding Graduate University.

Contributor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/divorce-air-wars_us_5b9d1617e4b03a1dcc845468,My divorce clients covet their travel points and are often surprised that they might have to share their points with a divorcing spouse.,2013-04-27,"USA, New York State, New York City, Low angle view of flying airplane",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d16171f00002d002178f9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I have only been fortunate enough to purchase a flight using travel points a few times in my life. But, when I did, it was a very satisfying purchase. In one instance, I flew across the country using points that took years to accumulate. It felt great. I earned that flight. So, it comes as no surprise that my divorce clients covet their travel points and are often surprised that they might have to share their points with a divorcing spouse. In Florida, these travel points (frequent flyer miles, hotel points, rewards points, etc.) are considered a marital asset subject to equitable distribution if the points were earned during the marriage. If the points or a portion of the points were earned prior to the marriage, then the points earned prior are considered a non-marital asset and not subject to equitable distribution. Sometimes it is hard to determine what the cash value of these points will be during the division of assets. If the airline or hotel places an actual cash value on the points, then it's simple. But often they do not, and the points vary in value depending on which flight or hotel property you wish to use, and what season or day you wish to use the points. The airlines or hotels tend to be very vague on the actual value of the points, which makes it hard for one spouse to simply give the other spouse cash to buy out the interest in the travel points. The best solution, if there is no actual cash value, is to contact the airline and have them divide the points into two separate accounts. Both spouses can take an account and use the points as they wish, independent of the other spouse. Be mindful that some airlines will charge transfer fees, which need to be considered in any equitable distribution schedule or settlement. Also, some rewards programs specifically forbid the transfer of points to anyone or by any means, even if it is stated in a divorce decree. If the airline will not allow you to split the points, then one spouse will have to maintain the points and agree to distribute one half to the other spouse upon request. The spouse who is in charge of the points would be responsible for booking the flight or hotel room for the ex-spouse. This requires both parties to cooperate and communicate with each other, which might not be the best option for some couples. Others could agree to set aside the points for children or other family members to use. It's important that you do some research regarding the mechanics and specifics surrounding the points so that your family lawyer is fully informed when going into settlement negotiations or a final hearing. Another concern is that often travel points expire after a period of time. There may be fees associated with ""renewing"" the points, which also need to be considered in any marital settlement agreement. I once had a client agree to send his spouse and his children on one last vacation. This was a parting gift of sorts and he agreed to use his travel points to send them on a trip of their choosing. He in turn kept the remaining points, if any, that were left. Unfortunately, having a client willing to be that generous is the exception and not the norm. If your travel points are a prized possession that you couldn't imagine giving up in a divorce, then you should do as much research as possible so that your attorney is fully informed when it comes the rules for transfer of points. Or, you could use the points and take your family on that nice vacation you always wanted take them on before it is too late.
