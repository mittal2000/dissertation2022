In honor of this weekend's Oscars, we're taking a look at what still makes this film such a timeless classic. We had the pleasure of seeing On the Waterfront last year at the TCM Classic Film Festival with star Eva Marie Saint in attendance. It was truly a delight to hear the lovely Ms. Saint talk in person about working with such brilliant talents as Marlon Brando, Elia Kazan, and Karl Malden -- and the full interview featuring Ms. Saint's discussion with Robert Osborne, followed by screenings of three of her films, including On the Waterfront, will air March 31, 2014 on TCM. For those unfamiliar with the film, On the Waterfront tells the story of Terry Malloy (Brando), an ex-boxer turned longshoreman who struggles with his conscience when a criminal investigation into waterfront crime puts him at odds with a corrupt union boss (Lee J. Cobb) and his own brother (Rod Steiger). Inspired by a tough local priest (Karl Malden), and stirred by a touching, guilt-ridden love affair with Edie Doyle (Eva Marie Saint), Terry eventually turns away from his complicity in waterfront crime and sparks a labor revolt against the corrupt boss.Embraced by both audiences and critics, the gritty and emotional film was nominated for 12 Academy Awards -- eventually winning eight, including the Oscars for Best Picture, Best Actor (Brando), Best Supporting Actress (Saint) and Best Director (Kazan).Filmed documentary-style in bitter cold on location at the Hoboken docks, On the Waterfront exhibits the kind of earthy realism that many studio-bound productions of the 1950s avoided. As Kazan noted in his autobiography, ""[t]he bite of the wind and the temperature did a great thing for the actors' faces: It made them look like people, not actors -- in fact, like people who lived in Hoboken and suffered the cold because they had no choice.""The film further created a sensation due to parallels between Terry Malloy's testimony before the film's waterfront crime commission and Elia Kazan's controversial appearance before the House Committee on Un-American Activities (HUAC) in 1952, during which he'd been pressured to 'name names' of estranged former colleagues alleged to have been communists. Indeed, On the Waterfront in its day not only became a gritty poem of the American working class, but also Kazan's plea against conformity -- both of the communist and McCarthyite variety. Whatever one thinks of Kazan's questionable behavior - the true motivation of which remains obscure -- the artistry of his film has never been in doubt. Indeed, controversies over the film's politics have abated in the sixty years since On the Waterfront's release, and what remains today is a stark, austere, almost religious masterpiece that derives its strength from the honesty of its emotions -- unencumbered by the usual Hollywood trappings of celebrity narcissism, violent action or visual effects.Indeed, seeing On the Waterfront on the Chinese Theatre's gigantic screen during the TCM Classic Film Festival reminded us again of why simple human truth in storytelling -- particularly as conveyed by expressive faces in close-up -- is always so compelling. On the Waterfront emerged out of the tradition of documentary realism -- standing midway between the Italian Neorealism of films like Rossellini's Rome, Open City and Fellini's La Strada that arose out of the ashes of WWII, and the later avant-garde realism of the French New Wave films of Truffaut and Godard. On the Waterfront found the ideal, humanistic point between these two styles, and in the process created its own, uniquely American idiom -- one featuring strongly defined, heroic characters, expressive film noir photography, and a poignant clash between group conformity and individual integrity. The realism of On the Waterfront also owes much to Elia Kazan's formative years in the Group Theatre and the Actors Studio, institutions steeped in the acting theories of the great Constantin Stanislavski. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, Stanislavski and his Moscow Art Theatre worked to portray greater human truth on stage -- what he called ""spiritual realism"" -- most famously in their productions of Chekhov's plays. [Contrary to modern misconceptions, Stanislavski was never locked into one 'method' to achieve this human truth; his system used a variety of techniques to help actors access their emotions. These techniques included experiments in 'emotion memory,' and then later what he found to be the more reliable 'method of physical actions.']One sees this realist tradition achieve its cinematic pinnacle in On the Waterfront -- and on the big screen (as opposed to on a TV or tablet), the movie's depiction of elemental human conflict is transformed into almost mythic proportions, like a tragedy from the Theatre of Dionysus during Periclean Athens. Kazan's camera never flinches in depicting concrete, specific reality -- the film is populated with expressive, poignant faces like those inhabiting the Greek Orthodox churches of Kazan's youth -- but the film is nonetheless timeless in exploring the tragic-yet-hopeful experience of being human. Such a perfect fusion of realistic acting and documentary-style photography (On the Waterfront won the Oscar for best black-and-white cinematography) has arguably never been achieved before or since, except perhaps in John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath.Indeed, in an age of digital special effects and endless image-manipulation, it's wonderful to see faces, characters, settings, and emotions as authentic and true as those in On the Waterfront. Certainly the loveliest face in On the Waterfront belongs to Eva Marie Saint, who discussed her experience making the film during a wide-ranging conversation with Robert Osborne at the TCM Classic Film Festival in 2013 (the festival returns again in Hollywood this April 10th-13th). We had the pleasure of attending that event, as well as the later Chinese Theatre screening of On the Waterfront at which Saint appeared again with host Ben Mankiewicz. [Quotes of Saint's comments below are based on our handwritten notes during those events. To see the full conversations, with Saint's charming recollections on acting opposite Cary Grant in Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest, or opposite Paul Newman in Otto Preminger's Exodus and in other classic films, be sure to watch the special when it airs on TCM.]During the conversation with Osborne, Saint talked about joining the Actors Studio shortly after her arrival in New York and how important this was to her: ""That's where I learned to use my instrument and have confidence in what I have... and to work and work and work with terrific actors... Brando was there, Eli Wallach, Kazan the director, they were all starting out."" Another pivotal early experience for Saint was being cast in a stage production of The Trip to Bountiful with Lillian Gish. Saint explained: ""Lillian Gish was another mentor in my life, my husband is another -- (and, she adds with a twinkle) -- so is Robert Osborne."" Kazan saw Saint on the stage and cast her in On the Waterfront. Saint described how when she was cast in the film, she would leave her home in New York in the morning, go to the film set in Hoboken, come home, get dinner for her husband (which she still does), and then act in the play at night. Saint said of the first day of the film's shoot, ""I cried as I left the house... I didn't know what to expect. My husband told me, 'It's Elia Kazan, Brando's there, you'll be fine.'"" Saint adds, ""I never worked with another director like Kazan. I think he was my favorite."" She recounted of Kazan's directing style: ""Kazan was very quiet, he would come up to you and whisper directions in your ear."" When Osborne asked her what she thought of Marlon Brando, Saint said, after a big smile and a dramatic pause: ""He was adorable, but a little frightening... you felt he could see right through you."" She added, ""he gave every line reading differently, so that it was always new."" Saint describes her first day on the set, ""I was nervous the first day. My first scene was up on the rooftop with the pigeons"" opposite Brando. Kazan came up to her and told her quietly, ""This is the first time you are up there with a strange man on a roof top... I want you to pretend there's a wild animal that could come out at any time.""Such advice apparently worked, for Saint went on to win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. Saint described her excitement at winning the Oscar, noting that she said in her acceptance speech, ""Thank you, I'm so excited, I think I'm going to have my baby!"" And, Saint added, she had her baby just two days later. After discussing her other roles in films like Alfred Hitchcock's North by Northwest, Raintree County (with Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift), Exodus, and Grand Prix (with James Garner and Yves Montand), Saint wrapped up the conversation with a wonderful bit of wisdom. Saint (who currently appears in Winter's Tale) explained what it is that draws her to a script today: she looks for a role where ""someone changes, where there's a character who's interesting."" Saint added this crucial point: ""The thing for me is, the longer you live, the smarter you get... and hopefully that makes you a better actress... because people are interesting.""As Hollywood gathers this weekend to celebrate the Oscars and commemorate another year in American cinema, this thought comes to mind: our movies, with their enormous budgets, elaborate special effects, and minute attention to external detail have never had such gorgeous and gilded surfaces as they have today -- but isn't it time we made an equal effort to authentically depict the inner lives of human beings, as well? This, surely, is where On the Waterfront still seems as powerful today as it was 60 years ago.Insight into human behavior -- in all its turbulence, conflict and complexity -- is still the prerequisite for good storytelling, an important thing to remember as Hollywood gathers this weekend to once again honor its best."

The 24-year-old recording artist entered rehab after throwing a rock through the window of his mother's car. Brown has been on probation since pleading guilty in 2009 to a felony charge of assaulting his then-girlfriend, Rihanna. Doctors at the rehab center say Brown suffers from bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and severe sleep deprivation, People reports. Bipolar disorder is a mental illness often characterized by drastic shifts in mood, activity, energy levels and the ability to carry out day-to-day tasks, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. The condition, which may be genetic, often begins before the age of 25 and can be treated with different medications like mood stabilizers. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition caused by a terrifying or traumatic event and is often characterized by flashbacks, nightmares, anxiety and/or uncontrollable thoughts about that event, according to the Mayo Clinic. PTSD can be treated with psychotherapy, behavioral therapy and/or medication. Both bipolar disorder and PTSD can lead to sleep deprivation in people afflicted with these disorders. Brown has been through periods of hardship in the past. He told Giant Magazine in 2007 that his stepfather used to beat his mom, which ""terrified"" him and made him want to kill his stepfather with a baseball bat.  "

Some Californian towns are within 100 days or less of running out of fresh water. Photo credit wikipedia.com Furthermore, at stake are almost half of all U.S. grown fruits, vegetables, and the nations leading dairy and nut crops. The future of California's $44.7B agriculture business is indeed facing dire consequences as our food supply and security is in real harms way. There are 2,500 varieties of apples grown in the U.S. Apples are the second most valuable fruit in America. Oranges are first. Photo credit Earth Dr Reese Halter  On Monday Gov. Jerry Brown introduced California's Emergency Drought Legislation. Eighty percent of the state's water goes into agriculture, as much of the land is arid but made fertile with irrigation. Immediate measures are required to protect it. The wave of California's future is desalination, ground water cleanup and storm water conservation.  For every problem there are at least three solutions and effectiveness is the bridge to our best friend in the 21st century - innovation.  A couple weeks ago I met Aaron Mandell the founder and chairman of Sonoma County-based WaterFX. His company is cost effectively cleaning up salty water using a modular system with solar thermal energy to recover water from a variety of sources for any use.WaterFX- Aqua4™ from Aaron Mandell on Vimeo.So how does WaterFx modular system work?  I asked him how he came up with this system? ""When I was first introduced to the water crisis in California, I was blown away by the scope and magnitude of the problem. Having been involved with other venture-backed energy startups, my first reaction was how is it possible no one is focused on this tremendous opportunity? We're talking about billions of dollars of water at stake serving millions of people and businesses across the state - resting entirely on declining infrastructure built in the 60's. A lot has changed since then, especially as it relates to climate change and our scarce natural resources, so it was very logical to look at what we could do to create a better water delivery system.""  Mandell, an environmental engineer and entrepreneur, has a very refreshing vision for California that ""we have all the water we need if we reuse our wastewater."" His modular solar thermal system utilizes the sun's energy to heat up mineral oil, which generates heat to power a pump. It boils the source water and collects its steam, that steam is the highest quality purified water. This ingenious system concentrates all the salts as solids, which are sold for use in fertilizers and metals. Unless ground water is cleaned up soils accumulate high salt concentrations. WaterFX is helping California's Central Valley obviate fallow soils. Photo credit WaterFx.co  ""Our approach at WaterFX is focused on zero discharge, or achieving greater than 95 percent water recovery so that the remaining solids can be processed into merchantable by products. We don't see salts as ""waste,"" but rather a resource,"" said an opportunistic Mandell.  WaterFX has successfully helped California's Panoche Water District over the past six months by producing 8 gallons a minute of pure water from saline discharge drainage or agricultural runoff from the world's most intensive growing region - the Central Valley. The project is now being expanded to provide 2 million gallons a day of freshwater. Solar thermal systems are an important green source of energy providing power for WaterFX to purify salty ground water. Photo credit WaterFX.co  Conventional desalination is fuel or electricity dependent and up to 50-60 percent of the total water cost can be the energy inputs. ""Solar desalination - using the sun to power the water production has very low operating costs and with scale the total water cost comes down with improvements in manufacturing, equipment and process technology,"" explained Mandell. This is not the case for fossil fuel-desalination, which can rise in cost with the increasing cost of electricity.  I was fascinated to learn that ""WaterFX believes strongly in an open source philosophy. What that means is that core to our business is sharing information with others and encouraging other entrepreneurs to do the same. Water is too vital and there is plenty of opportunity to build great water businesses, even with an open exchange of information. I was asked recently what a VC would think about a venture where you gave away your IP. Well, there are many different kinds of intellectual assets in a company - if we were a software company it would be the equivalent of providing access to the source code in order to build applications. Maybe it is counterintuitive, but we are focused on the applications and the source code will be strongest if a collective of users is constantly improving it.""  Currently in California there's a vast amount of agricultural run-off water that is toxic with salt concentration, which fallows the soil. All models that I am aware of show that the climate will become drier in the coming decade(s). So with Gov. Brown's mandate to cleanup ground water, WaterFX clearly has an important role to play because solar desalination can cost effectively achieve it. Bodega Bay is an exquisite slice of heaven on Earth, it's located about 40 miles northwest of San Francisco, Calif. Photo credit travelsandlandscape.blogspot.com  Mandell loves the ocean as several of his previous companies were named after beaches on Nantucket, one of his favorite places in the world, but since moving to California, Bodega Bay has become a pretty special place for him.The Golden State is a remarkable place that attracts some of the brightest minds and best business people on the globe. I felt very upbeat after a cup of coffee and listening to a plan on solving our fresh water predicament. I couldn't help but admire this bright-eyed, enthusiastic businessman who attended the University of Vermont and says ""Phish is pretty close to my heart - not just their music, but also the culture.""

""I was just looking at the Lanai five-year budget,"" he told a group in Las Vegas recently. ""And wow, it's expensive.""The Oracle CEO bought 98 percent of the island in 2012 for $300 million and has since described a grand and ambitious vision for an environmental Utopia -- one that includes everything from electric cars to solar- and wind-powered desalination projects. But one of the island's greatest environmental hurdles is sustainable agriculture, which is why Ellison recently announced plans to build four greenhouses and a half-acre of bio-beds on the island. Set to break ground this summer, the facilities are supposed to combat poor rainfall conditions and provide enough food for Lanai's 3,000 residents and many tourists.The 141-square mile island is home to two Four Seasons Resorts -- both of which Ellison owns -- and sees roughly 70,000 visitors annually, each with an average visit length of four days. The secluded Aloha state currently imports 85 to 90 percent of its food, but Ellison hopes Lanai can pave the way as an agricultural innovator. Of his new facilities, he noted, ""we think this is what agriculture is going to look like 20 to 30 years from now.""The planned facilities will use sophisticated computers to monitor drip irrigation systems. ""If part of the field is in shadow,"" Ellison explained, ""you put less water on that part of the field. If part of the field has higher acidic content, you fertilize that part of the field differently."" The facilities will also farm fish, allowing it to take advantage of aquaponics, which uses fish waste to add nutrients into a hydroponic system. As Pacific Business News explains, the systems would require only 10 percent of the water needed to grow an equivalent amount of produce in soil.Lanai was once known as the Pineapple Island since Dole operated the world's largest pineapple plantation there in the 1930s. While Ellison is focusing on a more diversified and organic crop rotation, he clearly wants to restore Lanai's potential for commercial agriculture, no matter the cost."

Still, organisers said disruptive actions by Moscow police and other incidents occurred each day of the games.""Sports is a human right...Sports must be free from any form of discrimination including discrimination on sexual orientation,"" Yablotsky told reporters on Saturday.""Unfortunately here in Russia our right to do sports is violated.

""They're a good organization, they help LGBT veterans, and if they help veterans they're OK with us,"" he added, using an abbreviation for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.MassEquality's application to participate in the March 15 parade - the group's fourth try in four years - was denied at first, said Kara Coredini, the group's executive director, in a telephone interview.But the Allied War Veterans Council, also an organizer, reconsidered after Mayor Martin Walsh, the son of Irish immigrants, threatened to boycott the parade over the exclusion and began attempts to broker an agreement.""That there is a conversation happening around allowing openly LGBT people to march in this parade is historic,"" Coredini said.She and Duross will meet this week to see if they can agree on how MassEquality's marchers can identify themselves in the parade through South Boston. Coredini said the invitation would be meaningful only if their unit could march ""openly.""""It's not political to want to be equal. It's not political to want to be visible and welcomed by your community,"" she said. RAINBOW FLAG WITH POT O' GOLDDuross said he was open to a discussion. When asked if the rainbow flag, the unofficial symbol of the gay rights movement, might be allowed, he hesitated.""If they put a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow and a leprechaun, then I think everyone would be happy,"" he finally responded.A spokeswoman for Walsh said the mayor and U.S. Congressman Stephen Lynch, both Democrats, had another meeting with organizers on Saturday.""It was a very positive meeting, and they remain optimistic that a solution can be reached that will work for all parties involved,"" the spokeswoman said in a statement.Unsuccessful efforts by gay rights groups to join the parade began in the 1990s, and reached the Supreme Court in 1995. The court ruled in favor of the organizers, saying a privately organized parade was free to exclude groups, if they disagreed with their message.In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio and the City Council have said they will boycott the city's largest St Patrick's Day parade this year because it bans gay pride signs.De Blasio, who, like Walsh, took office as mayor in January, called the practice ""discriminatory"" and is the first mayor to take such a stance since David Dinkins, the city's last Democratic mayor, did the same in 1993.

In each of the 50 states, income growth among the top 1% of earners rapidly outpaced that of the bottom 99%, according to a recent study.In four states — Alaska, Michigan, Nevada and Wyoming — average income increased exclusively for the top 1% and declined for the bottom 99%. In another six states, the top 1% accounted for more than two-thirds of all income growth between 1979 and 2007, while the income of the bottom 99% grew at a much slower pace. Based on a report published by the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), 24/7 Wall St. reviewed the 10 states with the most lopsided income growth.Click here to see the 10 states where income inequality has soared.In many of the states with the most lopsided income growth, real average income rose little, if at all, between 1979 and 2007. While the average income of the bottom 99% rose 19% nationwide, it rose less than 5% in eight of these states.In an interview with 24/7 Wall St., Mark Price, coauthor of the study and a labor economist at the Keystone Research Center, said that to many observers the issue of income inequality is a story about Wall Street’s growth. But “It’s not just a story of the financial markets in New York City,” Price said. “Over time, that [top] group in each state is accruing an increasingly larger share of the growth in income.”In fact, as of 2012, the financial sector comprised a larger share of the economy than in the United States overall only in three of the 10 states with the most imbalanced income growth. Additionally, the financial sector contributed among the least in four of these states. The financial industry accounted for just 2.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) in Wyoming in 2012, the lowest share of any state.Another factor that does not appear related to uneven gains in income is economic growth. Price told 24/7 Wall St., “Looking at growth and GDP over time is a pretty blunt instrument,” and the relationship between unbalanced income gains and economic growth is weak.GDP growth was the largest in Nevada, Arizona and Florida between 1979 and 2007 — all among the 10 states with most imbalanced income growth. However, among the remaining seven states were also Alaska and Michigan, for example, where GDP growth lagged much of the rest of the nation.State tax structures, too, may not play as large a role as many observers may believe. Price noted that, for most Americans, the decision of where to live was not tied to taxes. While three states with the most uneven income growth did not levy an income tax, three of the other 10 states — Hawaii, New York and Oregon — had exceptionally high top income tax rates.However, Professor Richard Burkhauser, the Sarah Gibson Blanding Professor of Policy Analysis at Cornell University, added that taxes and transfer payments should not be ignored. In an email to 24/7 Wall St., Burkhauser, who has argued against the significance of income inequality said, “Government tax and transfer policies [can] dramatically redistribute income from those who have large amounts of taxable market income to those who do not.”Still, according to Price, inequality in income growth “is a trend which should concern policy makers independent of the impact of taxes and transfers,” and that incomes — net of such considerations — have still disproportionately risen for the wealthiest 1%.To determine the 10 states with the most skewed growth in incomes, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed income growth figures from 1979 to 2007 from “The Increasingly Unequal States of America,” a study by Estelle Sommeiller and Mark Price published by the EPI. We also reviewed figures from 2009 to 2011 from the same study. The authors derived average income growth from taxable income data, net of inflation. Additionally, we also reviewed state GDP figures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, unemployment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and an assortment of figures from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2012 American Community Survey.These are the 10 states where income inequality has soared, according to 24/7 Wall St.: "

If you could see it, you wouldn't believe that there's anything good about it. The same goes for the Oscars,"" Delpy told So Film, via the Irish Independent. ""It's 90 percent white men over 70 who need money because they haven't done anything in a long time. You just need to give them two or three presents and they're in your pocket. It doesn't mean anything to me, so I don't really care if there are women in the selection process."" The actress' candid remarks are a departure from much of what's said about the state of Oscar voting. A recent New York Film Academy infographic reported a 5:1 disparity in men working in film compared to women, while a Lee & Low Books chart spotlighted the paltry 23 percent of the Academy that's female.Delpy also bemoaned what she sees as the declining state of independent cinema, which she attributes to Hollywood heavyweights like Harvey Weinstein. ""I think they love cinema, but they also like to take a movie and give it an added value, then kill everything left behind,"" she said. ""This has a lot to do with the Oscars. In the '90s, there were real independent movies, but they have slowly been crushed by the majors. The minute they take over something, they crush it. ... Every time I've become a part of the Hollywood mainstream, it's been crap! Let's be honest: 90 percent of movies made in Hollywood are crap."""

The Oscar host revealed in a new interview with Parade that her attempt to waltz around in a dress and heels prompted the tale of Gracie Hart, the FBI agent who goes undercover at a beauty pageant to stifle a bomb threat. “'Miss Congeniality' was written based on me,” DeGeneres said. “When I was getting ready to co-host the Emmys, the writer saw me [on TV] learning how to walk in a dress and heels. My stylist at the time -- a man -- was teaching me, and it was hilarious. The 'Miss Congeniality' writer saw it and thought it was brilliant.”In addition to revealing that Bullock's character is basically a DeGeneres derivation, the talk-show host noted that she once beat out Jennifer Aniston for a role. Her supporting part in the 1999 Ron Howard comedy ""EDtv,"" starring Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, finds her playing a TV producer who's responsible for an early iteration of reality programming -- but the role could have belonged to the ""Friends"" star instead.“Jen Aniston is my friend and she recently ­reminded me that I beat her out of that,” DeGeneres said. “I got the part and Jen Aniston didn’t!
