The stay-at-home-mom and winner of Food Network's cooking competition, which sets out to find everyday people who are ""the best at being the worst"" when it comes to preparing food, is actually the most-improved cook in America.Huffington Post Black Voices invited Kelli to the Sunday dinner table for a quick chat about what her win means, how it feels to no longer be the mom whose dish sits untouched at potlucks and what she's whipping up for her family this week.How do you explain to people what being the ""worst cook in America"" is?: The winner of ""Worst Cooks In America"" is actually the most improved cook in America, which I think is great [because] it really sends a message out to people that just because you're bad at something doesn't mean you will always be bad at it. If you have the courage to step outside the box a little bit, step outside your comfort zone, take a risk and try something new, you might become good at something you thought you might never be good at. If not, hopefully you'll just learn something along the way. I feel really proud that I took control of something that I was very fearful of.Aside from not getting eliminated, what was your objective in the competition? One of my objectives was to learn a better way to season food. I grew up in very tried-and-true, African-American Southern cooking traditions with both grandmothers from the South -- North Carolina and South Carolina -- and we cooked in lard, we fried everything, [we had] homemade biscuits and gravy for breakfast. I mean, it's a wonder we all didn't have a heart attack by the age of ten!The food was delicious, but it just wasn't healthy. Having a son now, I feel adamant that I don't want him growing up fighting the same food demons that I fought. So that was really important for me -- learning different cooking techniques, different seasoning profiles and things like that to pass on to him.What would you say are the biggest lessons you learned along the way? Number one is flavoring and using spices other than salt and Season-All. Really understanding fresh herbs and nuts and grains and spices that I never would have thought about before. In my household we never had cumin or coriander. If they were there, they came in some sort of spice rack and we'd pour them out because we didn't know [what to do with them].I also learned that I can make my own flavors better than the store can. Be it salad dressing, barbecue sauce, or marinades, I will likely never purchase those pre-packaged, processed things again when I can make them better and fresh myself. It's less expensive and it's tastier.So how are you taking what you learned on the show and, at the same time, maintaining the culinary traditions you grew up with?I'm still going to fry some chicken from time to time -- I'm not crazy! Macaroni and cheese, you just have to make. There are some things you just can't skimp on. But if I'm going to enjoy those, then I temper it so that my entire meal isn't bad for me. Are the stakes higher for you now on the potluck scene? Oh the stakes are so much higher! Everyone is looking at me like ""Oh, this better be amazing."" And I now get recognized in the market. Suddenly strangers think it's okay to go into my cart at the grocery store to look at what I'm eating, and it better be something tasty looking. I can't even have a frozen pizza or they're going to give me the eye.So yes, the expectations are very high, but I say this: It's still just food. So I'm not worried; every meal is not going to be perfect. As long as I do the best that I can, it'll be fine. (But I will practice privately before I serve anything at a party or a potluck!)Do you have a speciality dish now or are you still just experimenting with lots of different things? I'm experimenting, but I would say my speciality is steak now. Not just because I made it in the finale [of the show] but because I was a terrible steak cooker before. I didn't know how to season it. Now I really am pretty good, I have to say, at making different rubs, creating my own recipes for rubs and making steak that tastes really, really flavorful. The key is in the rub. I was always one to drown it in A1 sauce because my flavor profile was terrible. Salt is not a flavor profile. I'd never heard of things like Hungarian paprika or porcini mushroom powder, and now those are staples in my kitchen. I can't live without them!"

However, somewhere between Steve Rogers, Captain America's alter ego, and Iron Man Tony Stark, a notorious war-profiteer, superhero ideals changed. ""Marvel's The Avengers"" features a group of strong-willed, stubborn superheroes who are forced to work together against their will. They all have different opinions and different ideas on how to take down their nemesis Loki (Tom Hiddleston). Unfortunately, communication is practically non-existent. In the film, they fight -- a lot -- and not with Loki but with with one another.Superheroes have always been representative of the time from which they came from, so is the plight of the ""Avengers"" symbolic of America today? Mark Ruffalo, who stars as The Incredible Hulk, believes so. ""I think this movie is really a metaphor for where America is today and where we need to be to move forward,"" Ruffalo told The Huffington Post at the New York City premiere of ""Marvel's The Avengers"" Saturday night. ""In the end, it's the community working together, without the real egomaniacal leader. It's going to take all of us working together, with all of our strengths. We don't need to dominate to move forward. We need to work together. Everyone has their own strengths and their own talents. We can all benefit from one another."" According to ""Avengers"" star Clark Gregg, however, the evolution of the superhero -- from crime-fighting role models to troubled men and women unsuccessfully dealing with the burden of saving the world -- can be traced back to Marvel's origins. ""I think it's what Marvel did that changed comics,"" Gregg, who stars as Agent Phil Coulson, explained to The Huffington Post. ""DC had Superman, and he was the All-American hero. Superman and Batman were both from the World World II era of black-and-white superheroes. Then Marvel came in, in the '60s and '70s, and started asking questions about heroism and rescuing people whose job that was. They were the first to ask, 'Who are you to be doing that?' And they explored what a toll it takes on your character. That's always been present in Tony Stark, and you certainly see that in all of them in 'The Avengers.'""

Expectedly, the royal couple delivered the pomp and circumstance of a British affair, while their American counterparts delivered the drama and glitz that we've come to expect from the Kardashian clan. But which wedding was the most extravagant?Here's how the two weddings stack up against each other:The Ring RW: The ring was purchased by Prince Charles for $60,000 in 1981, but it was technically free for the newlyweds since the 18-carat sapphire stunner was purchased for Princess Diana first.  KK: Kim’s 20.5-carat engagement ring cost $2 million, but Humphries reportedly received a hefty discount.The Dress RW: Kate wore an Alexander McQueen gown that cost $434,000. KK: Vera Wang designed Kim's wedding dress plus two other dresses worth a total of $60,000 free of charge.The Venue RW: Fortunately for the royal couple, Westminster Abbey and Buckingham Palace come free with the title. KK: The Hollywood couple also didn’t have to pay for their venue, receiving free rental on Montecito’s Sotto Il Monte estate.The Flowers RW: The Queen and Prince Charles foot the bill for the $800,000 flower arrangements the two venues. KK: The couple spent a whopping $2 million for the flowers that adorned their locale.The Catering RW: Since the palace already has a full-time catering and event staff, there was no additional charge for the food. The A-list guests noshed on canapés. KK: Caviar and Kobe beef burgers were on the catering menu served by Wolfgang Puck, who we're also guessing offered up his services gratis.The Cake RW: There were two cakes, a fruitcake and a chocolate biscuit cake for William, costing $80,000 courtesy of Prince Charles.  KK: The $20,000 black and white cake was, you guessed it, also free from Hansen’s Bakery.Total Price Tag RW: $34 million KK: $20 millionLength of Marriage: RW: Still going strong! KK: 72 daysWhile Kate Middleton showed us that good things come to those who wait (going from commoner to princess: priceless), Kim's second attempt at matrimony wasn't so successful. Let’s hope Kim K and Kanye make it to the aisle -- third time’s a charm!Now that you're armed with some data, how do you think the two costly nuptials compare?See some other royal weddings from last year below, and click here for more royal wedding anniversary coverage!"
