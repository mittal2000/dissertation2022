2,CULTURE & ARTS,Post-Election Prescription: A Generous Dose of Robert Bly,"Jennifer Nix, Contributor
Writer and activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/robert-bly-poetry_us_5bb23bf6e4b0171db69e9818,"A person moves toward poetry out of need, says Robert Bly, when religious instruction perhaps fails to resonate deeply enough, or when trying to get in touch with one's senses.",2012-11-17,"Fishermen try their luck in the Wabash River Thursday, October 4, 2012, near the Davis Ferry Bridge near Battle Ground, Ind.

(AP Photo/Journal & Courier, Michael Heinz)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb23bf62000003000ffda15.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A person moves toward poetry out of need, says Robert Bly, when religious instruction perhaps fails to resonate deeply enough, or when trying to get in touch with one's senses. This was certainly true for me, as I faced a devastating medical diagnosis and forged a path back to health. Poetry continues to guide and inspire me, and a few months ago even led to work on Haydn Reiss's new film-in-progress, Robert Bly: News of the Universe. (Photo by Ann Arbor)Having encountered Bly's work only cursorily prior to Reiss's project, I am now awed by the astonishing breadth and depth of Bly's influence in the spheres of poetry, cultural theory and political activism. This is a man who changed the course of poetry in America by opening it up to the imagination and the deep-image aesthetic, as well as through his generous and tireless translation of poets from other nations. His provocative theories on gender and modern manhood, despite significant controversy, are part of our national psyche. With the election now behind us, I also believe the clarity of Bly's political positions and moral quest, through his poetry and considerable talents for organizing and motivating others, along with his commitment to the interior life and commitment to the community, offers a true north for artists and activists addressing the problems afflicting our country and planet.As Bly is dedicated to reintegrating poetry with life -- daily life, the life of the body, spiritual and political life -- Reiss's film seeks to portray a life fully and creatively lived, while also suggesting how poetry can invigorate and heal individual and collective wounds that may keep us from the work we must undertake. I spoke to Reiss about his project and, if you like what he says and what you find at the various links included, please join his campaign to fund the final phase of this project. A move toward poetry, as individuals and as a movement, may be just what we need and Robert Bly (who will turn 86 next month) has already lit our way.Jennifer Nix: Poets in earlier times were central to societies, and Robert Bly's life seems to be one dedicated to restoring some of that traditional energy and vitality to the poet's role in American society. Do you agree? Haydn Reiss: I think good poets have always been with us, maybe not on the front pages but working on the edges of culture. There is an unbroken line, going back to at least Whitman, of poets who share similar concerns as Bly -- the importance of an interior life as well as being a citizen. Robert is certainly an extraordinary example. He began in the 1950s publishing a host of emerging American poets of the day, along with publishing translations of great poets from around the world. These were often the first English versions available in the U.S. If this is all that Bly did he would have secured his legacy as someone who changed the direction of poetry in the United States, but he also tirelessly wrote his own poems, essays and critiques, and was dedicated to taking his and others' poetry to the people, doing readings and conferences all around the country. Bly is a controversial figure for some. Why is that?When you've been outspoken your whole life it comes with the territory. Robert also chose to remain outside of academic circles because, I think, he didn't see poetry as something -- in its most vital aspect -- that could be taught.Did his political activism affect how his poetry was received, particularly after The Light Around the Body and what happened when he won the National Book Award for that collection in 1968?There are always those who believe art should exist for art's sake, keep the politics out. Robert is not one of them, and if you were alive then, and of an age to witness it, you saw a country in crisis over what was happening in Vietnam. Bly felt the war was a betrayal. The older men in charge were not telling the truth to young men asked to fight it, and as a citizen and a poet, Bly felt he must speak out. He co-founded American Writers Against the Vietnam War, published books and took part in hundreds of readings. When he won the National Book Award, he used the occasion of the award ceremony to chastise the cultural elites for not doing enough to protest the war. It's a brilliant piece of oratory. By the way, Robert has also been a vocal opponent of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.Tell us about the work with men related to his book, Iron John.Iron John was a surprise bestseller. It spent over a year on the New York Times best seller list and was translated into 15 languages. It struck a powerful chord among the people, especially men, who read it. It made Robert very well-known and also the subject of a ferocious push-back. This is a complicated piece of Robert's history that my film will unpack and clarify but, basically, when you challenge orthodox views -- such as what makes a man -- you stir up a hornet's nest. Too many people thought they knew what Iron John and the men's conferences were about from reading some snarky piece of journalism. Pick up the book and you'll be startled by how prescient he is about what ails our culture. However, not everyone who knew Robert as ""a poet"" could follow him on this road. Can you explain Bly's impact, and the changes in American poetry that stem from his poetic project?This is one of the themes of my film. Bly's influence can be traced in a variety of realms. There is, of course, his own poetry, and that of all the younger poets he's helped. The importation of world poets to our shores is certainly one of his great gifts. He inspired Coleman Barks to translate Rumi and now everyone knows Rumi. Bly was among the first to recognize the genius of the South American and Spanish poets, and did pioneering translations of Pablo Neruda, Federico García Lorca, Antonio Machado, Juan Ramon Jimenez...the list just keeps going. And there is also his work with German and other northern European poets, such as the Swedish winner of last year's Nobel Prize in Literature, Tomas Tranströmer. Bly also championed the great Indian poets Kabir and Mirabai in the 1970s. He has a tremendous intellect and energy, and seemed to need to do this work for his own sanity. And in doing so, the beauty was shared with all of us. As Jane Hirshfield puts it in the film, ""Robert Bly, as few other poets have done, has changed the world for all who now share it."" Tell us about your film and why you chose the title.News of the Universe is the title of a 1980 anthology edited by Bly. I think it's a great film title, too, as Bly is an extraordinarily curious and brilliant man who has told us so much for so many decades. He's a reporter for the Universe inside us and around us. My hope, and I think Robert's as well, would be that a film like this can help people find messages that resonate with them, that more folks will give poetry a try. If you get lucky and stumble into the right poet for your heart and soul, then the love affair begins.How can readers here help bring this project to fruition?I'm trying a crowd-funding campaign on Indiegogo for the first time. We've worked over a year now on News of the Universe and gotten amazing interviews with Gary Snyder, Jane Hirshfield, Donald Hall,  Galway Kinnell, John Densmore, Caroline Casey, Philip Levine, Edward Hirsch, Mark Rylance and others. The film explores Robert's inner or soul work, reflected in his love of ecstatic poets like Rumi and Hafez, and his outward engagement with community, whether during the Vietnam War or with men around Iron John. Take a look at the trailer and get a taste of what we're up to. Spending time in the world of Robert Bly has been very good for my heart and mind. I think others will benefit from a generous dose of Bly."

It's just a sign of my age -- like the purple veins creeping up my calves.Sadly, another formidable sister has passed on. And yet again, she is one who deserves to be publicly praised. My sense is that I have not been the only one who has been sitting banging keys for the past two weeks describing the force of nature known as Harriet Selwyn. A ""force of nature"" aptly describes the woman, who helped bring L.A. women onto the fashion scene.Harriet Selwyn died on October 18th, surrounded, as she was in life, by her beloved posse. She died in her own bed, in her own home. The home that reflected the beauty, artistry and quality of the life she created and lived to the fullest. Doing it, as always, and as the song says, her way.Hailing from New York City, Harriet arrived in L.A. in the early '70s. Along with Holly Harp and Norma Fink (Theodore's Beverly Hills), Harriet was responsable for waking L.A. gals out of the doldrums and getting them dressed! First under her label ""Fragments,"" and later just ""Harriet Selwyn,"" she introduced the women of L.A. to casual yet elegant dressing with silk jersey pieces that mixed and matched and traveled well. She taught us that casual and quality can indeed go hand in hand. Harriet's house, and then her ""salon"" on Nemo Street in West Hollywood (several doors down from current hot spot, Donna Karan's Urban Zen), was a creative hub and breeding ground for young fashion designers, artists and well-heeled, interesting gals about town. The list of Harriet's personal mentees is long and impressive. Rozae Nichols and Peter Cohen come readily to mind. Rosemary Peck, jewelry and interior designer, had a friendship and working collaboration with Harriet that spanned over 40 years. Jennifer Miller, accessories designer and boutique magnate (and one of Harriet's unofficial goddaughters), credits much of her success to being raised in the Harriet Selwyn School of Life and Design. Bold. That is the first word that comes to mind in talking about Harriet. Being an early breast cancer survivor, Harriet, as part of a group showing of photographs of naked women, displayed her one breast and the flat mound of scar tissue that had been her other breast, for the entire world to see. Here, this is me, and nothing is stopping me, not even cancer, and was her message to other women. When stores were late paying her for their merchandise, and she needed to pay her seamstresses, Harriet didn't care if the store was Neiman Marcus or an upscale boutique in San Francisco, she'd pick up the phone and get her money. When the Pressmans owned Barneys, she would demand that one of the brothers be put on the phone, if the store was late in paying her. To her it was about all respect and paying people their due, and standing up for what was rightfully yours.Harriet, tall of stature and carriage, contained an inner beauty and had a passion and an eye for beauty that is rare. She inspired just by being Harriet. Whatever she put on -- from rings, to bracelets, from dresses, to shoes -- complimented whatever else she had on brilliantly, and the total picture was inspirational and impressive. She was, up until the very end, a class act. At the end she called her BFFs to her bedside and gave them each one of her signature pieces of jewelry. Rosemary Peck, Marilyn Portanova and several others now sport their Harriet keepsakes around town, while others carry the true gem that was Harriet in their hearts"

Many corporations have virtual work spaces, but that wasn't something I had experienced before for an extended period.I really had to work on my attitude to stay positive -- yes, there were times I felt down, but I wasn't going to stay that way. Looking at what I had to be grateful for kept me taking the high road.There was a real benefit in stepping out of my comfort zone in a big way. It felt like my DNA was being reassembled. I have always thought of New York City as my home and work headquarters. But now I am more open to exploring other venues.

Inevitably, last month's ""Going Rogue: Kiss It, Kaiser"" blog came up -- the one about how I snapped and politely told my health insurance carrier to kiss my naked backside.Somewhere in the midst of enjoying our respective second rounds of Pinot, she put her head in her hand, stared into her glass and said, ""I haven't been insured in two years. I couldn't afford it anymore; not if I want to keep the house."" We both stared at our reflections in the bar's mirror. Then there's the Ph.D.-holding, award-winning classical music composer and conductor I've known for more than 20 years. He launched a music teaching program that has won awards. He emailed me that he's been living uninsured for more than a year. ""I can eat, or I can go to the doctor,"" he emailed. ""I chose food.""My neighbor is 27 years old and working around the clock to complete an IT degree to financially better his family that includes 18-month-old twins. ""Even the school's policy costs too much,"" he said, helping me schlep a trash bin.I'm not one lick surprised to learn of others' non-medical-insurance conditions.

I've been caught off guard, these last weeks, when friends and acquaintances have cornered me and whispered of their own non-insured situations. No one told me of the outright embarrassment that perfectly responsible, 50-hour-a-week working folk suffer as they quietly, reluctantly and often painfully relinquish the financial protection they originally sought in having their medical bills financially covered.All this collective shame seems terribly wrong. Along with all the other pains that presently accompany the United States' health care crisis, now comes yet another layer of burden: that of added mental and emotional despair. Some might judge the non-insured. It's easy, assessing those who might well go bankrupt should medical crisis strike. It's tempting to say that they (which includes me) should have planned better. Accusation and admonishment are aplenty.That's pure hogwash. If you need a roof and you need food and you need to get to work and school and keep the kids' feet in decent shoes, survival comes first. If you work your tail off and live a good life and the income can't absorb ever-increasing health insurance premiums, premiums that currently surpass many a monthly mortgage payment (as did mine), self-insuring can and often is the only thing left.An M.D. reacted to the blog about walking away from insurance costs running amuck like this: ""It would take millions more (people) to walk away so that insurance companies and, yes, the government wake up to the truth ... I don't believe health care is a free enterprise commodity. I think it should be a right under the Constitution because without it, there cannot be life, liberty or any happiness. Eighty percent of health care cost is medico-legal issues. If we solve this, we can resolve the health care issue and will be able to afford health care for all.""I don't know the correct emotion to this crisis: shame, embarrassment, helplessness or anger. Maybe there is no correct emotion. I do know that last year a visiting house guest fell while on a walk, suffered a head injury and, even when she grew drowsy, found enough presence of mind to say (in a concussion-infused panic), ""Don't you dare call an ambulance. I can't afford it. I don't have insurance.""  It was a mortifying moment for us all. If you've spent any time in a third-world country, you know that there's no place like home. America the beautiful is where anyone can be anything -- a black man can be elected to president, twice. Openly gay and bisexual people can serve in the armed forces, the Senate and beyond.We just can't be sick. To hell with the shame. Like the black, the homosexual, and the bisexual visionaries who refused to live as second-class citizens and who now look to make law, there's a synergistic dissatisfaction, a rumble in the country's soul. The U.S. can and should address this exigency.Because a family dealt the blow of a child with cancer should not also be forced to endure a crippling bankruptcy in the treatment of that child.Allowing such conditions? We should all be ashamed.For more by Cathie Beck, click here.For more on health care, click here."
