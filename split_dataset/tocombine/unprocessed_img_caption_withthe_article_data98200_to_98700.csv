Spencer Green)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5babe5301f00002e01227851.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The first day of school only happens once a year, except in schools like mine, when the first day happens far too frequently for many of our students and teachers.Our 4th graders are taking the NAEP this year. The survey asked about our mobility rate. The question was multiple choice, with 0 percent being the lowest rate, and ""20 percent or more"" being the highest rate. Our school has a 30 percent mobility rate, so we were off the scale.Mobility is the rate at which students enroll or transfer from a school during the year. Our 30 percent rate means that if a class of 33 students begins the year, only 23 of those original 33 students will be enrolled by the end of the year, with ten transferring out and ten new students will have enrolled to replace them. Mobility might not sound like a problem, but it is, especially when coupled with crippling poverty. I always taught in schools serving high-poverty populations of 90 percent or more, but I never considered the effects of mobility until I became an administrator. You rarely hear about mobility as a pressing issue, but I contend that it needs to be.Through my own observations and speaking with our students and teachers I've come to believe mobility is as damaging, if not more-so, than poverty itself. The first twenty days of a school year are so crucial there are multiple books written about the subject. Within the first twenty days teachers must establish classroom routines and expectations that will either make or break the entire school year. From my vantage point as a principal I've witnessed teachers that fail to establish productive classroom norms in the first 20 days, and the students and teacher (and their neighboring colleagues) suffer the entire year for it.The other day one of our kindergarten teachers exasperatingly told me how frustrating it is when she loses a student or gains a new one after the first twenty days. Strong classroom management can prevent a new student from disrupting the flow of things, but when it happens a couple times a month, it affects all of the relationships in the learning environment.We want teachers to be caring and develop strong emotional bonds with our students, especially in elementary schools. In schools with high mobility, teachers develop a tough skin and learn not to attach too quickly to any student. Our teachers work damn hard, but it's rough when you invest personal time tutoring and mentoring a child just to see them disappear to another school before the end of the year. This potential for detachment doubles-down on the emotional damage the student is already suffering from having to move schools, meet a new teacher, make new friends, and learn new routines.  In Chicago mobility is directly related to poverty, but the families that are the most mobile seem to be a subset of the poor. Many families rarely move, but a small percentage of them move every year. I know students in 8th grade that have been to seven different schools. On the Southwest side of Chicago you can draw a line down Kedzie Avenue. Schools to the West of it have a mobility rate closer to 5 percent. Schools to the East have a mobility rate hovering around 30 percent. Despite the fact all the schools serve students that are predominantly from low-income families, there is a very noticeable difference between our communities. I've been told that teachers, students, and parents from other schools don't like to visit ours because the neighborhood looks and feels much different, with many more boarded-up homes and less of a cohesive neighborhood feel to it. Our population is more African-American than the other neighborhoods, too, which undoubtedly plays a part in their perceptions. When families from more affluent neighborhoods visit our school for basketball games the wary looks on their faces makes me wince. Families from schools like ours enter with a less-guarded attitude. The difference is plain to see.Our families don't move because one of their parents got a new job and the company paid them to relocate. Our families' reasons are numerous and varied, including homelessness, foreclosure, eviction, family breakup, death of a parent, or the avoidance of gangs, and often a combination. This last reason is always the most perplexing to me. I've had families tell me they want to move so their children don't get caught up in the local gangs, but they often move from one high-crime neighborhood to another. I used to be quick to criticize such a decision, until I realized that in a town like Chicago, ""choice"" isn't a right, but a privilege based on income, class, and skin color. It's illegal to discriminate based on race or income, but how else can you explain such a segregated city in which a school within walking distance from ours doesn't have a single black kid?We rarely hear about the effects of mobility on the quality of learning in schools like ours, but public neighborhood schools like mine haven't been as much of a priority as schools of ""choice"" like charters, magnets, and selective-enrollment schools. In Chicago choice isn't a right, it's a privilege."

This is HuffPollster for Friday, January 30, 2015.PEW RESEARCH EXPLORES THE PUBLIC'S VIEWS ON SCIENCE - Cary Funk and Lee Raine: ""Science holds an esteemed place among citizens and professionals. Americans recognize the accomplishments of scientists in key fields and, despite considerable dispute about the role of government in other realms, there is broad public support for government investment in scientific research...[For example] 79% of adults say that science has made life easier for most people and a majority is positive about science’s impact on the quality of health care, food and the environment...[and] About seven-in-ten adults say that government investments in engineering and technology (72%) and in basic scientific research (71%) usually pay off in the long run. Some 61% say that government investment is essential for scientific progress, while 34% say private investment is enough to ensure scientific progress is made."" [Pew]Finds huge gap between the views of the public and scientists on science issues - Seth Borenstein: ""The American public and U.S. scientists are light-years apart on science issues. And 98 percent of surveyed scientists say it's a problem that we don't know what they're talking about. Scientists are far less worried about genetically modified food, pesticide use and nuclear power than is the general public, according to matching polls of both the general public and the country's largest general science organization. Scientists were more certain that global warming is caused by man, evolution is real, overpopulation is a danger and mandatory vaccination against childhood diseases is needed. In eight of 13 science-oriented issues, there was a 20-percentage-point or higher gap separating the opinions of the public and members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, according to survey work by the Pew Research Center. The gaps didn't correlate to any liberal-conservative split; the scientists at times take more traditionally conservative views and at times more liberal."" [AP/HuffPost]Why Pew Research is going deeper on science - Lee Raine: [T]oday’s publication marks a more formal commitment to studying the intersection of science with all aspects of society – from public opinion, to politics and policymaking, to religious and ethical considerations, to education and the economy...We hope to explore that and to understand more fully how news and information about scientific activities makes its way to citizens, how they understand it, and how, in some circumstances, they contribute to it. In the coming months, [Pew Research] will release more findings from our surveys of the public and scientists. A forthcoming report will provide a detailed analysis of the partisan and ideological differences that underlie some of the disputed policy areas. Another will pay particular attention to how people’s spiritual views and practices are tied to these issues. And yet another will look more directly at issues related to Americans’ general knowledge about science phenomena, updating previous research we have done about citizens’ science literacy."" [Pew]POSITIONS ON IMMIGRATION LEVELS MOSTLY STEADY - Andrew Dugan: ""As congressional Republicans weigh whether to file a lawsuit against President Barack Obama for his executive actions on immigration, 60% of Americans say they are dissatisfied with the level of immigration into the country today...In a follow-up question that queried Americans who are dissatisfied with the current levels of immigration, the majority -- 39% of U.S. adults in total -- said they would like to see the level of immigration decrease. This ranks among the lowest level of Americans who are dissatisfied and express a desire for less immigration since Gallup began asking the question in 2001, even if it is nominally higher than last year's 35%. The share of Americans who are dissatisfied and want more immigration (7%) was unchanged from 2014. Fourteen percent of Americans said they were dissatisfied with the current level of immigration in the country, but did not express a specific preference for either increasing or decreasing it."" [Gallup] AFGHANS WANT GREATER U.S. INVOLVEMENT NEXT YEAR - Sudarsan Raghavan: ""Many Afghans would like to see a greater American role after this year than is planned, while a majority believe that last year’s runoff election that led to a U.S.-brokered power-sharing government was 'mostly fraudulent'... 46 percent said they want to see a greater commitment by U.S. forces than is in place. The United States and its NATO allies withdrew most of their forces last year and have roughly 13,000 troops in Afghanistan. The U.S. contingent is expected to shrink to about 5,000 by the end of the year...In recent weeks, senior Afghan officials have also indicated that they would like to see a greater U.S. presence after this year. Only 29 percent of Afghans said they prefer that fewer or no U.S. troops remain…Two-thirds of Afghans favor a significant role for U.S. and international forces in training Afghan forces in the future."" [WashPost, Langer Research]A HISTORY OF DISCOMFORT WITH FEDERAL DEFICITS - Kathleen Weldon: ""In 1940, ""People's Research asked Americans if it was important for the federal government to balance the budget in the next two years. Fifty-seven percent agreed, while 30 percent said no…Since [1973], in poll after poll, strong majorities of Americans have agreed that balancing the budget is important. However... [w]ith the introduction of a wider set of possible problems, the federal budget deficit dropped out of the top slots for several years. Since the recession, however, it has consistently been the second most-chosen top economic problem, behind unemployment... Americans' concern about the budget has always been shot through with a strong dose of skepticism for the likelihood of actually achieving a balanced budget and reducing the deficit...Though the public has often been willing to postpone or forego tax decreases to achieve a balanced budget, generally they prefer spending cuts, or spending cuts coupled with tax increases, to tax increases alone as an approach to balancing the budget... The most recent such question from CBS News/NYT in February 2014 shows attitudes have changed somewhat: 4% preferred only tax increases, 29% only spending cuts, and 65% both.""

And, in today's world, much of the power resides with global business. Nowhere is it more apparent than in Davos. Last week, I took part in a special session of the WEF, which was designed to bring business elites from Ukraine, Russia, Europe and the rest of the world together in search of a solution for today's impasse in a political dialogue amidst rapidly deteriorating situation in Eastern Ukraine. To be frank, the session did not meet my expectations. Regrettably, even the most programmatic business people struggled to find any common ground against the backdrop of increasing violence and mounting death toll. It is indeed a huge undertaking for business to step up when politicians can't seem to find the pathway to peace, but that is exactly why they must try! Business alone can't resolve the conflict, our political leaders and diplomats must remain in the driver's seat. Transfer responsibility to a wrong party would be unconstructive. However, the role that private sector can play must not be underestimated, and there are a few areas where the global business community could act now:Acknowledge the problem and speak out. When recent shelling in Mariupol claimed lives of more than 30 civilians, including two children, how can anyone remain silent? I would be first to advocate that business must stay out of politics. There is no need for business to take sides or point fingers, but dead silence is equally indefensible. Every responsible businessperson must speak out for peace and must condemn violence. Joining the initiative of Richard Branson or one taken by WEF or launching a new effort is the very least one must do. When business speaks out publicly, politicians often listen. It is clearly of mutual interest for Ukrainian and Russian, as well as global business community to stop the war, and the more voices join in the louder is the message. Contribute to the dialog. We must learn from history and leverage the experience of such initiatives as Consultative Business Movement in South Africa or the Group of Seven in Northern Ireland. As a responsible global actor, business must mobilize resources, including the time commitment from the CEOs, to keep open channels of communication. If the situation does not improve, how will it affect your business? What is the impact on your investment strategy? Those messages have to be communicated to give better context for decision-making by politicians and provide stronger incentives in their search for peaceful resolution. Provide humanitarian aid and contribute to private-public collaboration  Words alone are not enough to bring relief to those in a conflict zone, and here again, business has a responsibility and an opportunity to show leadership by providing humanitarian aid. We must find ways to alleviate human suffering and stay united in our support of the innocent victims regardless of our own views on the origins of the conflict or parties responsible. Investing in humanitarian support you will invest in the reconciliation after the war. Offer analytical support The Group of Seven in Northern Ireland was instrumental in articulating the arguments for peace. A quasi think-tank was formed that gathered information on the cost of war and its impact on business. Today, the economic consequences suffered by business in both Russia and Ukraine range from access to markets, reputational damage, sanctions that hamper companies' ability to borrow, credit downgrades, loss of competitiveness, etc. Continued communication around the direct and ancillary costs of conflict, especially coming from business, will be instrumental in de-escalating tensions. Lastly, little can be achieved by Russian and Ukrainian business people alone without strong engagement and backing from the global community. Given the ever-growing divide of how the situation in Eastern Ukraine is understood in Moscow and in Kyiv, my appeal is to all concerned business leaders to join the conversation and empower your Russian and Ukrainian peers to stay the course and maintain whatever bridges still remain. We must leverage all informal channels and establish a constructive dialogue between top business leaders and the politicians. If business continues to talk and search for a solution, they can show the way for politicians to do the same."

Indeed, California children most likely will prosper, as they become the inventors, innovators, and creators of this new-truly global-economy.This is not just another government report to gather dust. It is a well thought out set of recommendations and an action-oriented directive. Special thanks to the hard work of the task force's leadership and the philanthropy of the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation this report has real meat, structure and direction.Together with what California has already accomplished the last two years, this effort to fashion a ""robust 21st century model of arts education (which) will become the center for creative education K-12."" Citing an 18-month major report by President Obama's Committee on the Arts and Humanities, CREATE CA recognized that ""The arts embody creativity and, as such, are taking a central role in many national studies."" The Blueprint has recommendations that touch on every aspect of teaching and learning in all K-12 schools, but what makes this effort most attractive is the commitment to developing a long term agenda, insuring sustainability and creating a program of assessment and accountability.Significant also is the creation of a permanent staff, and a management structure bringing all the major organizations together (the California Alliance for Arts Education (CAAE), the California Department of Education (CDE), the California Arts Council (CAC), the California County Superintendents Educational Services Association (CCSESA), and the California Parent Teacher Association (PTA), and potentially 4 representatives of significant arts organizations or initiatives), and redefining ""Create CA as an independent coalition charged with ongoing convening of the California arts education community, coordinating action among the members of the coalition, and broadly marketing arts education advocacy to the greater public.""The new organization has already advertised for a ""Project Manager (who will be) responsible for planning, coordination, and support of the entire CREATE CA coalition and its efforts under the direction of the CREATE CA Leadership Council chair and vice-chair."" But one of the most exciting and promising efforts, which the Blueprint"" understands well, is how the recommendations in the report coincide with the Creativity at the Core initiative, adopted by the state, as it ""place(s) discrete arts education and arts integration at the forefront during the implementation of the Common Core for all California K-12 schools -- specifically, through the creation of teacher professional-development modules that incorporate dance, music, theater, visual arts, and other arts forms into Common Core instruction.""The California County Superintendents Educational Services Association (CCSESA) has held several arts training events based on a groundbreaking program called ""Creativity at the Core"" in advance of the broader vision.Developed as a result of a grant from the California Arts Council and supplemented by The William and Flora Hewlett Foundation, CCSESA has modules created by Regional Arts Leads, a member of the Association's Visual and Performing Arts subcommittee, as part of CCSESA's Statewide Arts Initiative. The event will be held at the Sacramento County office of Education's Leadership Institute to focus on ways to ""build Artistic Literacy through Common Core State Standards,"" and Employ techniques to use the arts -- art integration -- ""as a Model of Rigorous Instruction.""Recently, the California Arts Council received a one-time, $5 million increase in its 2014-15 budget, bringing its total support from the general fund to $6 million. This kind of funding by the State Assembly, according to Craig Watson, Executive Director of the Council, represents a significant ""commitment to arts education and California's young people, and a desire to stimulate economic development in communities around the state through the arts and creativity.""Hopefully this just the beginning of the legislature's awareness that the arts are crucial in our schools and our communities. We are fast becoming an economy in which the most successful nations are deploying every means available to produce a workforce that creates and innovates. As the demand to meet the challenges of a global knowledge economy is rapidly increasing, few things could be as important in this period of our nation's history than art and art-infused education.For all of the above, this is another auspicious effort by California which should lead to a renaissance in education."

CAMEROON ON THE BRINKCameroon, struggling with an influx of refugees from Nigeria, which is battling Boko Haram Islamist militants, is on the brink of a humanitarian crisis, said Khan.""(We) want to make sure that host communities are not at an additional disadvantage as a result of an influx of people and to beef up services for nutrition, water and sanitation and health,"" she said.""We are going to have to have some very strong child protection activities ... to make sure that there's no further recruitment of children into armed groups.""Khan stressed that UNICEF has an equal commitment to children regardless of whether the crises that affect them make headlines.""To me, whether it's Cameroon, Central African Republic, Niger or Palestine, those kids all deserve an equal chance and equal opportunity,"" she said.""Where a child is born (should not) determine their destiny and whether they're going to get humanitarian assistance or not.""

9,POLITICS,Obama Wants To End The Era Of Sequestration,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-sequestration-budget-2016_n_6567816.html,,2015-01-29,"NEW DELHI, INDIA - JANUARY 27: U.S. President Barack Obama addresses at Siri Fort Auditorium on January 27, 2015 in New Delhi, India. Obama said, 'We believe in the promise of India, we believe in the people of India. We are proud to be your partner as you build the country of your dreams. We are not perfect countries, have known tragedies and triumphs, have lot of challenges, but our two nation posses the key to progress.' He spoke on the topic 'India & America: the future we can build together', describing the numerous opportunities that both countries have to build a constructive partnership. (Photo by Vipin Kumar/Hindustan Times via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e6342400005000577752.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama will propose a budget on Monday that calls for an estimated 6.8 percent increase in discretionary spending -- an approach diametrically different from the last time Democrats sustained major midterm election losses. The spending proposal will almost assuredly get strong pushback from Republicans in Congress, who now control both the House and the Senate and wield even more power than they did four years ago. For that reason alone, the budget is another sign of a president feeling unhindered in his final years of office and eager to take advantage of an improving economy. Details of the budget have been guarded closely by administration and Capitol Hill officials. But sources on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue said Obama will propose increasing discretionary spending by about $70 billion (several sources cautioned the proposed increase likely will be slightly less). The money would be divided equally between defense and non-defense accounts. Senior White House adviser John Podesta has been briefing lawmakers on budget specifics, according to a top Democrat on Capital Hill. A bigger reveal is expected on Thursday, when Obama delivers remarks to the House Democratic Caucus in Philadelphia.“The President will propose to end the across-the-board sequester cuts that threaten our economy and our military,"" a White House official said. ""The President’s budget will fully reverse those cuts for domestic priorities, and match those investments dollar-for-dollar with the resources our troops need to keep America safe.” An administration official told The Huffington Post that the spending additions the president will outline -- which appear larger than those he proposed in last year's budget -- would be offset by cutting spending and closing tax loopholes. The overall budget, the official added, would have measures to reduce the deficit through a similar combination of savings. For Republicans, the proposal will likely be perceived as fiscally reckless, if not politically brazen. After all, it was the GOP wins in the 2010 election that set the stage for sequestration's across-the-board budget cuts in the first place. After that election cycle, Obama attempted to craft several debt-reduction deals with House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) as a nod to conservative victories. But the deals never came to fruition. And in the summer of 2011, as the debt ceiling was nearly breached, the two sides fell back on an exchange that neither truly liked. Under The Budget Control Act of 2011, spending was reduced by nearly $1 trillion and Congress created the so-called Super Committee to find roughly $1.5 trillion more in savings. When the committee failed to find consensus, mandatory sequestration cuts kicked in, forcing more than $1 trillion in cuts over 10 years. Sequestration was delayed a few months starting at the beginning of 2013. But by March of that year, it was law of the land. Though Republicans have lamented sequestration's effects on defense operations -- and some have worried about non-defense programs in their districts -- they have largely resisted proposals to replace sequestration with any package that includes tax hikes. With the president now proposing to do just that, it’s hard to see how a budget agreement will be hashed out.“Republicans believe there are smarter ways to cut spending than the sequester and have passed legislation to replace it multiple times, only to see the president continue to demand tax hikes,"" said Cory Fritz, a spokesman for Boehner. ""Until he gets serious about solving our long-term spending problem it’s hard to take him seriously."" But Obama also may find critics of his budget proposal on his side of the aisle -- for not being bolder. A roughly $70 billion increase may seem healthy, if not daring. But as The New York Times noted, it represents a small portion of a budget expected to reach $3.9 trillion, and it comes at a time when the deficit is shrinking. Senate Budget Committee ranking member Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), for one, has called for a major government investment in infrastructure and other domestic priorities well beyond where the Obama administration appears willing to go.The administration’s hope is that somewhere in the ideological middle (albeit closer to the liberal side of the divide), there will be enough lawmakers to forge a majority. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash) were able to craft a deal to alleviate some of the budget cuts brought on by sequestration in December 2013. A request for comment from Ryan’s office was not returned late Wednesday night. But the Murray-Ryan deal only lasts for two years. And come fiscal 2016, which starts in October, budget caps will return –- ensuring that federal spending will be essentially flat. According to numbers put forth by House Democrats on the Budget Committee, defense and non-defense discretionary spending caps were $1.014 trillion in fiscal 2015. They are estimated to be $1.106 trillion in fiscal 2016. UPDATE: 12:30 p.m. -- A White House official emailed HuffPost more specific details about the spending increases the president will propose in his budget:The President’s Budget proposes about $74 billion more in discretionary investments than would be allowed under sequestration in 2016, a roughly seven percent increase over the sequestration level. This includes $530 on the non-defense discretionary side, an increase of $37 billion over the spending caps, and $561 billion in defense spending, an increase of $38 billion over the spending caps."
10,COLLEGE,Penn State Task Force Calls For Disclosure Of Sexual Assault Punishments,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/penn-state-task-force-sexual-assault_n_6566598.html,,2015-01-29,"This is Old Main on the Penn State University campus Friday, Nov 28, 2014 in State College, Pa. (AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar )",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae55153c000018010b6e6c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Penn State University should reveal more information about how the school punishes sexual assault, change how it investigates rape claims and survey students on their experiences with sexual violence in college, a task force said Thursday.The Penn State task force on sexual assault report makes 18 recommendations, including improving employee training, identifying which staff members must report assault cases, hiring a full time Title IX coordinator to oversee improvements, and releasing expanded data on sexual misconduct punishment. ""Right now, in the absence of information, people fill in their own gaps,"" Danny Shaha, senior director of Penn State's student conduct office, told The Huffington Post on Wednesday. Alexandra LaMont, a student member of the task force, said the campus gets text messages each time an assault is reported, but nothing is shared when a sexual violence case is adjudicated. Penn State should provide more information to ""bridge the gap,"" she said.The handling of sexual assault cases at Penn State and 94 other U.S. colleges and universities is under review by the U.S. Education Department's Office for Civil Rights, prompting many schools to examine their policies. Penn State's task force was set up in 2014 and includes students, faculty and staff members. Following meetings and conferences to gather feedback, the task force released its report to the Penn State president on Jan. 23, and to the public on Thursday. President Eric Barron will consider the group's suggestions. Few other universities share information about how sexual misconduct is punished, the report notes. But that's changing. Some Penn State students, according to the report, believe ""the consequence for plagiarism, for example, was often more severe than the consequence for sexual assault, and cannot understand why.""Several task force members denied there's a punishment disparity. But they said they want to reevaluate sanctions for sexual assault and share more information with the campus community. Damon Sims, vice president of student affairs and chair of the task force, noted that light sanctions often come at the request of victims, which he said was an important consideration.""Admittedly, the redemptive purpose of the University's student discipline process discourages harsh penalties,"" the report says. ""But the seriousness of sexual misconduct must be met with appropriate consequences.""A 2014 national analysis of sanctions by The Huffington Post found that students who are judged responsible for sexual assault are infrequently expelled, and are often either suspended or placed on probation.Legislation introduced in the U.S. Senate last year would require colleges to release data on the outcomes of sexual misconduct cases. Schools currently have no obligation to do so. The task force suggests that Penn State consider a restorative justice process in some cases, which encourages an accused student to acknowledge wrongdoing, and that the school change how misconduct charges are applied in other cases.The school's current model for handling sexual assault cases, with a hearing panel, doesn't fully inform accused students about charges, the report says. The process also allows ""inflammatory statements about students' prior sexual histories, emotional and psychological difficulties."" To fix this, the university should move toward a single investigator model, with a trained staff member to interview witnesses, collect testimony and evidence, and make a presentation to a panel that would adjudicate the outcome. ""Not everybody has gone in that direction, but we're going that way as quickly as we possibly can,"" Sims said.The task force calls for the university to begin surveying the campus climate on sexual assault as soon as April. Penn State was one of many schools that declined to participate in a survey created by the Association of American Universities, an elite higher education trade group, which was criticized by faculty researchers nationwide. Sims said Penn State leaders are ""glad"" they chose not to take part in the group's survey. The Penn State task force hopes to establish its own survey, influenced by a White House pilot survey at Rutgers University, and may work with peer institutions in the Big 10 Athletic Conference on administering it.The task force report also criticizes university efforts to prevent sexual assault. The report says students are already adults by the time they arrive on campus, with ""relatively little prior education on sexual assault."" Many already have been socialized into unhealthy and risky practices, the report says. Some of the current education programming is ineffective, the task force says. Melissa McCleery, a student member of the task force, noted that many students fail to pay attention to the required online modules on sexual violence. Penn State should reconsider its programming and emphasize bystander training to help compel students to stop an assault when they can. ""In a party situation, where someone has been drinking and someone else is trying to take advantage of them, you don't have to step in and be a hero and change the entire world,"" McCleery said, describing bystander intervention. ""It can be, 'Hey, I think your friends are looking for you, can you come over here with me?'""Sims said the task force considered changes likely to result from the federal investigation. The possibility of new federal or state laws may require further changes, he said."

Most immigrants at the center are awaiting deportation or removal and return to their home countries, while some are interned at the facility while their immigration cases are being reviewed. ICE in Arizona holds almost 3,000 immigrants statewide, all at the detention facilities in Florence and nearby Eloy. Arizona, which deports and returns more illegal immigrants than any other state, is currently appealing a judge's ruling suspending controversial provisions of Arizona's immigration enforcement law SB 1070. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baea4102100002501c6ea18.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Immigration and Customs Enforcement has refused to release a transgender migrant woman from detention in an all-male facility, according to ICE and the woman's attorneys, even though advocates say she has a credible asylum claim and has faced abuse from guards and fellow detainees. The case of Nicoll Hernández-Polanco, an asylum seeker from Guatemala now detained in Florence, Arizona, has become a rallying point for immigrant rights groups and the LGBT community, with some advocates arguing that ICE should stop detaining transgender people altogether. Hernández-Polanco, 24, began the process of transitioning to female at age 14, which advocates say opened her up to abuse from her family and violence from gangs. She first crossed into the United States illegally as an unaccompanied minor at age 17, fleeing violence in Guatemala.She was deported and spent much of the next few years living in migrant shelters in Mexico. In October, Hernández-Polanco returned to the United States and turned herself in to authorities at the border, claiming asylum based on her fear of persecution because of her gender identification. She was placed in an all-male detention center, despite Department of Homeland Security regulations saying that ICE should take gender identification into account when assigning migrants to detention facilities. Advocates say that since being detained, Hernández-Polanco has been assaulted by another detainee, and that guards have groped her during routine pat-downs and referred to her using slurs like “it” and “woman with balls.” “Unfortunately, Nicoll’s case has been really typical,” Olga Tomchin, a fellow at the Transgender Law Center, told The Huffington Post. “Nicoll clearly identifies as a woman. She’s been on hormones for years. She presents herself as a woman. She has said she does not want to be housed with men, that she doesn’t feel safe, and ICE has ignored its own rules.”Attempts to interview Hernández-Polanco by phone were unsuccessful. Hernández-Polanco’s attorneys declined to comment on the specifics of her pending asylum claim for fear of jeopardizing it, but said they had trouble understanding why ICE refuses to release her from detention while the case moves forward. “The only thing that they’ve mentioned is that they consider her a flight risk because of the prior deportation,” Hernández-Polanco's attorney, Heather Hamel, told HuffPost. “But we’ve even offered that she be released subject to ankle monitoring or subject to court-ordered supervision. Those requests were denied. At this point, why she remains in detention is anyone’s guess.”U.S. law affords some protections for transgender migrants in detention. In 2012, the Obama administration instructed the Department of Homeland Security to conform to the requirements of the Prison Rape Elimination Act, which included drafting new rules to better guarantee the safety of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and gender-nonconforming detainees. Current regulations say that ICE should take the gender identification of transgender and intersex detainees into consideration when assigning them to a detention center. “U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is firmly committed to providing for the safety and welfare of those in custody,” ICE said in a statement. “ICE has a strict zero tolerance policy for any kind of abusive or inappropriate behavior in its facilities and takes any allegations of such mistreatment very seriously.” But advocates say ICE routinely fails to follow its own rules, calling the Hernández-Polanco case emblematic of a wider problem. “ICE has shown over and over again that they are incapable of detaining transgender people with even minimal levels of dignity and safety,” Tomchin said. ""We really believe that the only solution is for ICE to not detain trans people at all.” This post has been updated to clarify the source of the information in the first paragraph and the order of events in Hernández-Polanco's life."

The epidemic is also still spreading geographically there, with a first confirmed case in Guinea's Mali prefecture bordering Senegal, which reopened its border with Guinea on Monday.A resurgence of the virus in Guinea, where the outbreak began, would threaten President Alpha Conde's goal of eradicating Ebola from the country by early March.""It is too early to declare a success or a deadline for success,"" Dr. Peter Salama, global Ebola emergency coordinator for the U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), told a news briefing.""Our work is far from over. During the course of this outbreak, we have repeatedly under-estimated this pathogen.

(Photo by Nomi Ellenson/FilmMagic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafd4701f00003901231d4a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ryan Scott Oliver could very well be musical theater’s answer to an auteur filmmaker or a gothic novelist, and for good reason: the 30-year-old composer-lyricist says he’s equally inspired by the likes of Quentin Tarantino and Stephen King as he is Stephen Sondheim. “I like to think of my artistic perspective as being morbidly optimistic,” Scott told The Huffington Post in an interview. Like Tarantino and King, he sees darkness as the common denominator in all of his work, noting, “I believe in happy endings, but I also believe that there’s a lot of really, really awful sh*t that people have to go through in order to get there.” New Yorkers who aren’t familiar with Scott's shows, like 2014's “Jasper in Deadland” and 2009’s ""Mrs. Sharp,” will get an opportunity to be introduced to the scope of his musicality at Manhattan nightspot 54 Below on Feb. 2. The composer will join Broadway veterans Jay Armstrong Johnson, Lindsay Mendez, Andy Mientus and Derek Klena (among others) for two back-to-back concerts showcasing his eclectic -- and occasional eccentric -- melodies. Jay Armstrong Johnson sings a tune from ""Jasper in Deadland.""Though he’s yet to be produced on Broadway, Oliver has already garnered a cult-like following among legions of theater fans, as evidenced by the fact that both performances were nearly sold out at the time this story was first published. That comes as little surprise to Johnson, who praises Oliver’s music as “deep, rich, innovative and new.” “His stuff is never based on a movie or a book -- the source material is always his brain, which is twisted, genius and exciting,” Johnson, who is currently starring in the Broadway revival of “On the Town,” said. ""He’s always dealing with religion, he’s always dealing with sexuality … things that are dark and semi-uncomfortable, but which always make you think. As an actor, you don’t really come across many composers of that breadth and depth.” Oliver, who set out to become a composer in high school and aims to pen at least one new show every year, also acknowledges the inherently queer themes that thread his work. One example is his 2010 musical “Darling,” which put a “dark, jazzy and sexy” spin on the story of “Peter Pan” by, among other things, recasting the Lost Boys as male hustlers. He says he’s most drawn to narratives that feature the “fabulousness” and “shimmer” of traditional musical theater, but also highlight the triumph of an underdog. “I really like creating underdogs as well as the people who will suppress them and aim to destroy them,” he said. “I’m really fascinated by monsters that take human form.” Oliver married photographer Matthew Murphy (left) in 2014.  Fortunately, Oliver has found an ideal personal and professional partner in the form of dance and theater photographer Matthew Murphy. The couple collaborated on an experimental multimedia exhibition, “35MM,” in New York in 2010 and 2012; Murphy has since gone on to shoot many of Oliver's shows, including “Deadland.” In May 2014, they tied the knot in a Brooklyn ceremony officiated by Mendez.Noting that he and Murphy have a “loving creative competition” with each other, Oliver added, “Our relationship is never jealousy-inducing, but I’m always aware of the fact that I'm married to a very talented, driven person. We set a good example for one another, and that’s a very, very special thing. He's a genius, so that doesn't hurt either.” Actress (and longtime pal) Lindsay Mendez sings from ""35MM.""   So what's next for Oliver following his 54 Below engagement? These days, much of his creative energy is focused on a new, folk-driven musical called “Rope.” A production of “Jasper in Deadland” opens in Seattle in May, and Oliver says he is hopeful that “Darling” will be fully staged in New York in the imminent future, following a reading in late January.For now, however, Oliver is content to be creating the niche musicals he wants to make, even as mainstream Broadway audiences flock to jukebox shows like “Mamma Mia!” “There’s a crowd who wants to go to a musical for a good time, and there's a crowd who wants to see a musical to be changed,” he said. “For me, if I write a good story, I think people will want to see it. You have to write the show that speaks to your heart in a given year.” ""RSO at 54 Below"" plays New York's 54 Below on Feb. 2. Head here for more details. "

Richardson/ The Denver Post)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5d3a0d433b00003700dad7c7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's time for us all to adopt a new playbook that truly honors American Indians. It's time for the Washington football team to change its name. The Fritz Pollard Alliance, a civil rights group dedicated to promoting diversity and equality in the National Football League (NFL), has joined the growing chorus of protests against the Washington football team's ongoing use of a dictionary defined racial slur as its name and stereotypical caricature as its logo. The Alliance recently released a statement that described a meeting they held with the Washington team to discuss changing the team's name and logo in which the Alliance was ""shouted down"" by Washington team representatives. The Washington team's inappropriate response is unfortunately consistent with the ""playbook"" that the Washington team and NFL continues to use to defend the offensive and harmful team name and logo of the Washington team. This ""playbook"" appears to be as follows:1. Reframe a dictionary- and government-defined racial slur as a term of ""honor."" In his letter to fans, Dan Snyder claims that the ""R-word"" is a ""badge of honor."" NFL spokesperson Adolpho Birch further stated, ""It's not a slur."" In actuality, the Washington football team's name is defined as a racial slur in almost every modern dictionary. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office canceled the team's trademark because the term was found to be ""disparaging.""The NFL further went to claim that the team name was made to honor then-coach William ""Lone Star"" Dietz. Yet this claim of ""honor"" ignores statements from the former team's owner George Preston Marshall, arguably the most infamous segregationist in sports history. In a 1933 interview Marshall stated, ""The fact that we have in our head coach, Lone Star Dietz, an Indian, together with several Indian players, has not, as may be suspected, inspired me to select the name R*dskins."" More, the notion that this term was a badge of honor ignores several examples of racially insensitive behavior including the use of the term ""scalp 'em"" in the original Washington team song, and the frequent use of red face and appropriation of American Indian headdresses at Washington football games. 2. Disregard protests of Native Americans and civil rights leaders. Several major American Indian organizations including the National Congress for the American Indian (NCAI), National Indian Gaming Association (NIGA) and Native American Journalists Association (NAJA) have issued public statements condemning the use of the ""R-word."" In addition to the Fritz Pollard Alliance, major civil rights groups such as the NAACP, Leadership Conference for Human and Civil Rights, The National Council of La Raza and the Anti-Defamation League have all condemned the practice of using this slur. Recently, DeMaurice Smith, the Executive Director of the NFL Player's association, said that the Washington team name conveyed ""racial insensitivity."" As of this moment, the Washington team and NFL have not publicly acknowledged that almost every major American Indian organization such as the NCAI, the oldest and most representative organization of American Indians, have repeatedly issued formal statements that the Washington team name is an offensive slur. However, there have been at least three instances when representatives of the Washington team have claimed American Indian support, only to have this claim contradicted. Washington's team owner Daniel Snyder has asserted that the Red Cloud School was consulted and the school subsequently approved the use of the ""R-word;"" the Red Cloud School made a public statement denying any involvement in determining the Washington football team name and stating that it also considers the ""R-word"" a demeaning racial slur. Similarly, team representative and former Washington player Mark Moseley claimed that the Alabama Coushatta tribe was supportive of the ""R-word;"" the Alabama Coushatta tribe promptly responded, saying that they support the NCAI efforts to oppose the Washington name. Further, whereas Washington football team representatives insisted that no American Indians protested the name in visits to American Indian reservations, Jim Enote, the director of the A:shiwi A:wan Museum and Heritage Center in Zuni, New Mexico, said he spoke with Snyder last November about his displeasure with the team name, only to be rebuked by Snyder. 3. Ignore science showing harmful effects of racism against American Indians. Professional organizations, such as the American Psychological Association, American Sociological Association and American Counseling Association, have issued statements that the use of ""Native"" team names and imagery is detrimental to children's mental health and development. Experimental laboratory studies demonstrate causal effects that the presence of American Indian sports team logos results directly in lower self-esteem and lower mood among American Indian youth; longitudinal studies show that discrimination predicts increased depression and substance abuse in American Indian youth over time. More, studies also show that exposure to American Indian sports names and logos activate negative stereotypes of American Indians among non-American Indians. While polls should not be a basis for determining policy, the Washington team's disregard of Native American opinion also comes in the selective reporting of polls. In 2004, the Annenberg Center issued a poll that found that 90 percent of American Indians were not ""bothered"" by the Washington team use of ""R-word."" This poll has been criticized on almost every level, most notably the lack of evidence that those who identified as American Indians were in fact American Indian. A more recent poll this year that required evidence of tribal membership to participate found that 67 percent of the respondents thought the ""R-word"" was a racial slur. Another recent poll shows that the majority of Americans would not feel comfortable using the ""R-word"" when directly speaking with an American Indian. Further, The Washington team and NFL continue to report the 2004 poll without acknowledging these new polls. 4. ""Don't we have more important things to worry about?"" Defenders of the Washington team name often dismiss opposition to the team name as an example of political correctness gone awry. Further, those supporting the team often presents a false dichotomy whereby American Indians should be forced to tolerate racial slurs because they suffer from other ""more pressing"" issues such as poverty. In response to a letter from American Indian U.S. Congressman Tom Cole urging the NFL to support a name change for the Washington team, team representative Tony Wyllie responded by saying, ""Don't they have more important issues to worry about?""Not only do these statements contradict the social science demonstrating the harmful effects of racism, but they also contradict how the NFL handles issues of racism among other groups. Keep in mind that the NFL can act decisively against bullying and racism without needing to consult polls. Imagine the appropriate public outrage if the NFL decided not to sanction Rich Incognito for his use of racial slurs against Jonathan Martin because the African American population has ""more important things to worry about."" The good news is that fewer and fewer people are buying into the Washington team and NFL ""playbook."" Overall, claims made by the Washington team on its website have been labeled as mostly untrue by independent evaluators like the Washington Post. Research shows that broadcasters' use of the ""R-Word"" on television in 2014 declined by 27 percent. The largest protest in history occurred in Minnesota, drawing thousands of people. The Washington team also saw the largest home game protest of the name in the history of the team. The way that the NFL has treated the American Indian community and civil rights organizations such as the Fritz Pollard Alliance that have called for an end to the racist Washington team name and logo is atrocious. And just like the controversy regarding its handling of concussions and domestic violence, the NFL playbook of defending racist slurs against American Indians gives the impression that it does what it wants, when it wants, regardless of who gets hurt. It's time for a new playbook.Change the name."

RICHARDS/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e62c250000cf003a58d1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dear Mr. Speaker,This letter is about the invitation you extended to my Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, to address a joint Session of Congress a mere two weeks before the Israeli elections in March. I read your invitation and saw your tweet and immediately wondered why you had decided to involve yourself in our electoral process.About 6,000 miles separate you, in your elevated Washington, D.C. office, from us, here in Israel, but the distance does not annul our will, aspirations or the right to make decisions.It appears to me that your principal aim in inviting Netanyahu was to attack President Obama politically, a tactic that I, having covered politics for many years, including a long stint as Ma'ariv's Washington correspondent (when I also covered you, though we've never met) can appreciate. You went for Obama's jugular, not to say spat on him. But at the same time you are crudely interfering in our affairs -- 9 million citizens who are not the 51st state of the United States. We here in our special and volatile place in the Middle East don't particularly want you to step in and set our public agenda.The person who chose to call elections 34 months ahead of the end of his term is our Prime Minster, whom we elected a mere 24 months before. Netanyahu wasn't able to agree with his Finance Minister, Yair Lapid, about a 0 percent VAT Bill, and he dismissed Lapid plus five other ministers while calling for elections. Mr. Boehner, Israel is undergoing such a severe housing crisis such that people feel they have no recourse, and the Finance Minister attempted to find a solution to the problem, albeit in a clumsy and odd way. Netanyahu at first agreed, then disagreed, in short zigzagged, and Israeli citizens are furious that in six years in office he has been unable to restrain galloping housing and cost-of-living prices. Did you know that going to the grocery store is much, much more expensive in Tel Aviv than it is in America?Despite the fact that Netanyahu wants to talk about Iran and terror 90 percent of the time, polls here, in our little Zionist country, show that people are actually concerned about how they will make it to the end of the month. A big social justice movement took over our streets a few years ago and Netanyahu promised to help the simple people, a promise he has failed to keep. And then you show up, with a crassness I don't remember, and shove Netanyahu's Congressional address on Iran and extremist Islam onto our public agenda, despite the fact that Iran deadlines have come and gone for years now. Who knows this better than I, who has covered it for years? In truth, what do you care? You come here on expensive junkets, stay -- I'm sure -- at top hotels, without so much as a thought for the difficulties faced by the chauffeur driving you or for the salary of the guard at the hotel's entrance. Why don't you speak sometime with the housekeepers or the reception desk clerks and try to understand why Israelis can't stand to hear the word ""Iran"" again?So now that you have become Netanyahu's cheerleader (you know you'll make an appearance in his campaign ads, right?) and you're pleased that you managed to give Obama a black eye or embarrass the Democratic Party, I hope you receive this letter in which I want simply to deliver a message about an aspect you may have preferred to ignore: you are interfering with our democratic process in a blunt, unforgivable manner. I hope that our future leaders, whoever they may be, won't forget it.Tal Schneider, political correspondent and blogger, Politi.co.il (the Plog)Translated by: Noga Tarnopolsky"

Lewis's latest book, 'Flash Boys: A Wall Street Revolt,' tells the story of the Canadian banker who uncovered the underhanded and illegal practices carried out by some high-frequency traders on Wall Street.

While this news came as a shock to much of his loyal following -- he has shared his thoughts with his readers almost daily for 15 years -- he made clear his reasons for the change in his heartfelt announcement, which was (of course) given via his final blog post on the site.""There comes a time when you have to move on to new things, shake your world up, or recognize before you crash that burn-out does happen,"" wrote Sullivan. ""I am saturated in digital life and I want to return to the actual world again. I'm a human being before I am a writer; and a writer before I am a blogger.""While he may seem like a supernatural force in the blog world, Sullivan remains human like the rest of us and just as susceptible -- and perhaps more so, given his output -- to the increasingly common phenomenon of digital burnout. He wrote that his doctors attributed his recent health problems to the ""years of daily, hourly, always-on-deadline stress"" from blogging, and his constant ties to the computer strained his friendships, family relationships and marriage. Not to mention, he had little time for his interests beyond the blogosphere.""I want to read again, slowly, carefully,"" he wrote. ""I want to absorb a difficult book and walk around in my own thoughts with it for a while. I want to have an idea and let it slowly take shape, rather than be instantly blogged. I want to write long essays that can answer more deeply and subtly the many questions that the Dish years have presented to me. I want to write a book.""The response to Sullivan's announcement, grounded in concern for his personal health, wellness and happiness, not only reveals just how much his voice will be missed, but also how much his comments on digital burnout touched a nerve.Sullivan isn't the only prominent blogger to unplug from his job in search of a little digital detox. Politics blogger David Roberts decided to leave Grist.com for a full year after his constant connection with the online world threatened his real existence outside of it. Taking time away allowed him to not only restore his personal health but strike a necessary balance between reality and its virtual counterpart, a task that proves increasingly difficult to accomplish today.He may be taking a hiatus from his online post, but Andrew Sullivan will undoubtedly remain a writer. In his sign-off, he told readers that once he tends to his health and reestablishes balance in his life, they will see his byline again... maybe even in print."
