Valdeluz",2012-09-18,"CIUDAD VALDELUZ, SPAIN - JULY 05: A road network surrounded by wasteland remains the only evidence for a proposed residential development on July 5, 2012 in Ciudad Valdeluz, Spain. The new city of Ciudad Valdeluz, 60km from Madrid, was originally intended to be home to 30,000 people however it currently has only approximately 700 residents. Despite having the fourth largest economy in the Eurozone, the economic situation in Spain remains troubled with their unemployment rate the highest of any Eurozone country. Spain is currently administering billions of euros of spending cuts and tax increases in a bid to manage its national debt. Spain also has access to loans of up to 100 billion euros from the European Financial Stability Facility which will be used to rescue the country's banks that have been badly affected by a crash in property prices.

The city was built to house 30,000 people; instead, due to the economic downturn, it was never finished and only around 1,000 people took up residence there, according to The Daily Mail. Now a 24-hour security patrol is in place to safeguard the town's residents and a pharmacy is due to open soon, The Daily Mail reports. Despite the sparse population, the town is an eerie reminder of the economic downturn and how easy it is for towns around the world to be abandoned. "

In my opinion, a belt can make an outfit, adding just that personalized touch. Whether it's a vintage number that you use to give your seasons-old coat a fresh new look, or that neon skinny belt that you wrap around a simple cocktail dress that has everyone asking: ""Where did you get that frock?,"" belts are a game-changer. Sure, a new handbag or a pair of this season's ""It"" shoes will also up your style ante, but belts can be worn with multiple outfits, and are -- in most cases -- much less expensive. The key to belting it out in style is deciding which waist-cincher is right for you, both in terms of look and fit. Are you an understated kind of gal? Then a subtle brown belt à la Jennifer Aniston is right for you. If you're a little more daring and take inspiration from the likes of Beyoncé or Lady Gaga, a studded corset-style belt might be right for you. And as with anything fashion-related, it's imperative that you take your shape into consideration when looking for a belt. But don't fret, dear reader, we've done the research for you.Here, eight tips on the right belts for your body, as well as 50 celebrity examples of belts done right. We've also thrown in a few shoppable options, should you decide to give it a go. Want more? Be sure to check out Stylelist on Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr and Pinterest."

We love her bi-color jacket (brown suede and neon green is an unexpected and interesting combination) but what we really can't get enough of is how she expertly matched her top to her jacket, creating the illusion that it's one piece. Although Palermo went bright on top she still opted for a pair of printed pants but chose a neutral color palette to tone down the look. In terms of accessories the fashionista went with an oversized black clutch with red trim and a pair of ornate heels. The many elements of the ensemble called for subtle hair and makeup, both of which she executed brilliantly. We can only imagine how much fun the street style photographers had snapping Ms. Palermo.

GRASS SKIRTS!Back on the continent, the couple is successfully fighting the French tabloid that published topless photos of Kate. But for now, it's legal matters aside as the duo enjoys some much-needed R&R (and booze):""When they arrived, we gave them a pina colada each made from rum, fresh pineapple juice and coconut cream,"" said a co-owner of the Tavanipupu resort the pair stayed at on Monday. ""William liked it so much, we gave him another one. He had two, she had one. They got straight into the snorkeling and saw lots of beautiful fish. They were just swimming and enjoying the island. They had dinner on their own private jetty. This morning they walked out on the big dock.""After that overnight stay, it was off to Tuvalu on Tuesday, where dancers carried the couple from their private jet in hoisted thrones. With Catherine clad in a yellow eyelet dress and a chic updo, the pair were bestowed with even more accessories: flower crowns and necklaces (we think Will looks dapper in his).And then, the moment we've been waiting for this whole trip: DANCING. Catherine and William next slipped into grass skirts and joined the Tuvalu people at a party for some traditional moves. While Will's dance moves have long left something to be desired, Kate looks like she's doing just fine.You're going to want to see these photos. Trust us.PICS:Want more?

4,DIVORCE,My Post-Divorce Downward Mobility Has an Upside,"Pauline Gaines, Contributor

It was a gloomy December afternoon. We passed the Latino market, graffiti-streaked walls on a decrepit '70s apartment building, a front yard littered with boxes, Ikea cast-offs, a rusted car collapsed on the grass.Franny squeezed my hand and grimaced. ""We don't live in a very good neighborhood, do we?""Not so long ago, we lived in an impeccable Colonial with a terraced backyard and blue-tiled pool -- the scene of martini parties for 200. My former neighborhood was a tiny oasis in the city, populated by young, beautiful people who never seemed to work -- their days filled with yoga classes, dog walks, and strolls to the gourmet market for $5 smoothies.Then came the divorce. And a downsize -- with my two kids -- to a bungalow half the size of my old house. While our new neighborhood wasn't elegant, it was hip. Anything we needed was in walking distance: the Pilates place, the artisanal gelato place, the $75 t-shirt place, the attachment-parenting pediatrician.The house had a wraparound porch that I turned into an outdoor living room with recycled fiber rugs, old arm chairs, a wooden picnic table and chairs. On summer nights, votives and floating candles transformed the porch into the perfect cocktail party locale. Guests ate puff pastries filled with melted gruyere and caramelized onions, tossed back mojitos, their laughter wafting into the twilight.I had traded my pocket of elegance for urban hip and found that it suited my newly divorced self better. I was as happy as a stressed-out single mom could be.Then I met my husband Atticus, and we decided to get married. I had purchased the bungalow post-divorce with my ex's monetary help (bad, very bad idea), and had dimwittedly agreed to dissolve our real estate partnership if I remarried. I didn't want to leave the house and the trendy neighborhood I had grown to love. But Atticus and I couldn't afford to buy my ex out, and 1700 square feet wasn't big enough for our blended family anyway.So we found an affordable neighborhood 20 minutes away, a once-grand, then-scary, now-slooooowly-headed-towards-gentrifictation cluster of historic homes -- magnificent jewels smack dab in the urban chaos of pupuserias, stucco apartment buildings and sober living facilities.We bought a large, hundred-year old Craftsman that suited my aesthetics and our pocketbook. The day we moved in was the first time I saw the house without furniture. Was this why I hadn't noticed how warped the hardwood floors were? Why hadn't I seen the cracked tile in the bathroom shower? I muttered each time I had to struggle to yank open a crooked drawer. Most of the windows were painted shut and refused to budge.As Atticus and I lay in bed that first night, kept awake by the thwap-thwap-thwap of police helicopters ferreting out felons, we clasped hands in a what-have-we-done death grip. What if this isn't the bottom of the market? I asked myself. What if prices keep falling?And fall they did. It was not the bottom of the market. It was halfway to the bottom. It was before two houses across the street went into foreclosure. It was before interest rates dropped even lower and we tried to refinance, only to be declined and told how monstrously underwater we were.Now I, the Queen of Starting Over, the Mother of Reinvention, the Inveterate House Snob, was stuck. Stuck in a neighborhood that began to represent the gradual erosion of my station in life.One reversal of fortune led to another. Atticus's business got hammered by the Great Recession. We spent an obscene amount of money on a custody battle I couldn't afford to finish. My ex found a legal way not to pay child support.The house that had once been a deal now was an albatross we couldn't unload. We considered renting it and moving to something smaller. ""You hate the neighborhood anyway,"" Atticus said.As we debated the pros and cons of another change, a funny thing happened. I felt pangs of nostalgia for the house and the neighborhood I might have to leave. Without my realizing, I had grown attached to the Faulknerian ambience in which we resided.My neighborhood has a community spirit I have never experienced elsewhere. In the fancy part of town where I lived ten years ago, people mainly kept to themselves, up at the top of their winding driveways. In my funky, hip 'hood, dwellers were attached more to the scene than to each other. Here, however, is a different story. Our community is filled with civic-minded people who share our values -- artists, progressive thinkers, teachers, social workers. In a city that is primarily about money and status, we stumbled into the one place where people care more about who you are than what you have.Over the summer, I attended a neighbor's 40th birthday party. The house is being gradually remodeled but appears almost uninhabitable -- until you get to the backyard, magical with drought-tolerant plants and maple trees bedecked with lanterns and lit globes, water features and clusters of artfully mismatched chairs around tiled tables.Sipping Merlot, I marveled at the true richness of my neighbors. The research psychiatrist who treats the homeless. The mom spearheading a charter school. The neighborhood association head who, together with his wife, has rescued at least half a dozen crumbling homes and painstakingly turned them into museum pieces he rents to university students.The friends we've made are people we could call at 2 a.m. if there were an emergency. These are the people who appeared on our doorstep with apple pies, fresh-baked bread, and rolls of toilet paper when we moved in. When my son Luca was wreaking havoc on the street, one neighbor offered to turn her garage into a room where he could scream his anger out.If we moved, we would lose all that -- as well as the rambling house that I have grown to love, warped floors and all.When Luca visited from boarding school a few weeks ago, he and Franny sat on our porch swing eating soft serves from the rickety ice cream truck that drives up and down our street on summer afternoons.""I like this neighborhood better than our old one,"" Luca said.""You do?"" I was stunned. Luca likes to regale people with stories of the stuff he does with his dad: rides on private jets, boxed seats to sporting events, ski trips. He is, God love him, a snob. A little like me, before I lost everything to be snobby about.""Yeah,"" he said. ""I mean, it's sketchy, but it's kind of cool.""I asked Franny what she thought of the neighborhood now.""It's sketchy,"" she agreed. ""Except for some of the houses, like ours. But I get to have a friend here. I'm happy anywhere I get to have a friend.""She was referring to her pal who lives on the next block, the girl whose parents have the great backyard.""Don't you hang out with kids in your dad's neighborhood?""Her dad lives in the richest part of the city. Lots of BMWs, absolutely no pupuserias.""No!"" she said, emphatically.""There aren't any kids?""""There are kids. I just don't like any of them. All they do is talk about the stuff they have and where they go to school. They're boring.""As I listened to Franny continue about how she would never, ever want to hang out with those ""snooty"" kids, I smiled.My post-divorce downward mobility had an upside."

He's got some serious respect for sandwiches and a deep love for pie. And while Aaron Paul had some interesting things to say about food, and Rashida Jones did too, we're pretty sure that Jason Segel's love of food runs as deep as ours -- which is way deeper than Willy Wonka's chocolate river. Segel even put into words a dream we had always shared, but never realized. He wished that the world would change their idea of beauty so that we could all just eat more. Well said Segel, well said.
