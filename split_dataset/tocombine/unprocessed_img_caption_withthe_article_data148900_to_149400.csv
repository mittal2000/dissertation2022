As it turns out, this is quite a marketable demographic in the travel industry. CougarLife.com, a dating site designed for cougars and the young men who pursue them, polled 3,533 of their members to find out their favorite North American resort destinations.No surprise here: the majority of members prefer places with warmer climates and lots of activities. According to CougarLife.com spokesperson Marlo Jordan, “Many Cougars, like myself, prefer an active vacation that includes tennis, golf, hiking, and skiing.""And cougars are willing to drop dough to acquire a cub -- their average vacation costs $3,000. Rather than bringing along someone from home, 76.3% prefer to secure a hook-up during their vacation -- in fact, many plan to pounce on hotel or activity staff!Click through the slideshow below to see cougars' top vacation prowling grounds!"
1,WELLNESS,6 Mind Hacks That Keep Stress In Check (Really!),Kate Bratskeir,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stress-relief-tips-get-out-of-your-head_us_5b9d546ee4b03a1dcc86b82a,"Erase and replace. With the tap of a key, you can delete a typo from your screen. The same goes for a stressful thought. Miller",2013-07-16,Head with jumbled thoughts and organized speech in speech bubble,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d546e1f00002d00219207.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""Stress is our perception of what's happening outside of us and the power we give it,"" says Lauren E. Miller, author and stress expert. If you can adopt Miller's definition of the phenomenon as your own, you may find it possible to reframe your perception of stressful situations and, inevitably, experience less stress overall. The author of ""5 Minutes to Stress Relief,"" has compassion for hardship (as a cancer survivor she's been through a lot of it herself), but believes it's counterproductive to see yourself as a victim. Rather than letting stress overcome you, Miller insists you must transform it.Yes -- stress is, at times, imminent. It's ""recession-proof ... It's one of those things we, as human beings, wage a war against in the jungle of our mind,"" the author told The Huffington Post in an interview. The key to dealing with stress, according to Miller, is knowing that you are in charge. ""If you make the conscious choice and stay awake at the gate of your thoughts, then you can adjust your perception of any situation,"" she says. Being in charge may not come naturally, but there are some strategies you can use to show stress who's boss. Below, find six stress management techniques, all of which can be performed in five minutes or less, that can ""literally transform the way you do life."" Be mindful of how you label things. ""Life happens. You have a thought about it. It's completely objective until you label it,"" Miller explains. The way in which you decide to label a certain event -- whether joyful, good, painful or ugly -- will determine how your body reacts to it. ""Your cells are listening,"" she says, meaning it's your brain that tells your body how to respond to an event. Decide to take a moment before you judge and categorize a situation: It's your choice to label an experience as something beneficial (because you'll end up learning from it in the long run), or something strictly painful, that'll only make you hurt.Erase and replace. With the tap of a key, you can delete a typo from your screen. The same goes for a stressful thought. Miller suggests using the word ""delete"" consciously. Practice saying ""delete"" aloud. ""You can actually shift your attachment, you can sever the power you're giving to your negative thought that's defining your reality."" Use your imagination. If you feel you simply cannot pull yourself out of a negative situation or mood, turn to your imagination. Picture a time where you felt happy and not stressed, or make up an instance in which you would feel this way (even if it never really happened). Although it sounds too elementary to work, Miller assures us that the technique is gold. ""Imagination can shift our attitude and perceptions on the spot,"" she explains. ""Our conscious mind doesn't know the difference in terms of real and imagination."" So if you can just conjure something calm in the midst of chaos, you'll begin to experience calm. Look at your life as a movie. You're the director -- you get to decide which events become catastrophe, and which don't make the cut. This is a practice that involves stepping away. ""Be the watcher rather than the reactor,"" Miller instructs. Look at a stressful moment as if it's on screen -- imagine the scene that initially caused you to feel stressed, and imagine your reaction to it. There's a lot you can do with this power. You can add props (have the people who are making you feel threatened wear clown costumes, for example). You can make the aggressive characters in your life physically smaller, and decide that your voice is louder than all of the supporting actors of your life's movie. Looking at a problem from this angle will remind you that you're in control.Revisit what's valuable. Write down seven things you value most in life. It'll help put things into perspective, Miller explains. She says to put this list on a ""big, fat sticky note, or even make it your screensaver."" This list will remind you time and again that people are more valuable than things. This is your ""big picture"" doctrine. Stop by a graveyard. Admittedly, this sounds more than a bit morbid, but visiting a graveyard -- whether literally or figuratively -- can help you reframe a stressful situation. Ask yourself, ""Would I want to be worrying about this from my deathbed?"" and consider the choice you would have wished you made at the end of your life. Taking an ""aerial view from your death bed,"" as Miller puts it, might help you dig up some wisdom. Miller says when you're overwhelmed with life, you can experience tunnel vision -- ""you're giving too much power to something that's non-essential.""For more on stress, click here. "

Every mouthful is dreamy.As any mixologist will tell you, bitters are indispensable when mixing cocktails, but I love to use them in recipes too. They're perfect, for example, in this Chantilly, complementing the Cointreau while adding an extra layer of flavor to the whipped cream.Not only are cobblers easy to assemble, they can also be concocted with any summer stone fruits or berries, making them an incredibly versatile dessert. Just let your imagination or your local harvest inspire you to create your own delectable version.Here's to summer fruits and to the deliciousness they bring to your table!Peach-Raspberry Cobbler with Cointreau ChantillyServes 6 Active time: 30 minFor the dough 1 cup unbleached all-purpose flour 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 2 tablespoons organic sugar pinch sea salt 4 tablespoons unsalted butter (2 oz) (55 g) - cold, cut in 1″ chunks 1/3 cup heavy cream 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extractFor the fruits 2 lbs (905 g) ripe peaches (8 medium) - pitted, quartered and cut in 1/2"" slices 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1/3 cup organic sugar 2 tablespoons Cointreau 2 tablespoons cornstarch 12 oz (340 g) raspberries - rinsed and patted dryFor the Chantilly 2/3 cup heavy cream - well chilled 2 tablespoons organic sugar 2 tablespoons Cointreau 1/4 teaspoon orange bitters (optional) 1 medium ceramic baking dish (12"" x 9"") - butteredPreheat the oven to 350ºF (180ºC).Step 1: Place the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in the bowl of a food processor. Process at high speed for 15 seconds until well blended. Add the chunks of butter, making sure they do not touch each other. Pulse until the butter becomes a very fine crumb. Place the heavy cream and vanilla in a small bowl and drizzle evenly on the crumbly mixture. Continue pulsing until the dough comes together. Remove the dough from the bowl and gather into a ball. Wrap it in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 15 minutes.Step 2: In a large bowl, combine the peaches, lemon juice, sugar, and Cointreau. Sprinkle with the cornstarch and mix well with your hands. Add the raspberries and carefully mix again with your hands, being careful not to crush the berries. Set aside.Step 3: Place the peach mixture into the prepared mold. Unwrap dough and roll it out on a floured surface into a 1/2″ thick circle. Press a 2 3/4″ round cookie cutter into the dough to form 6 circles (make the last circle using the scraps). Lay the circles on top of the peaches. Bake for 45 to 50 minutes until the dough is golden-brown and the fruits are bubbly.Step 4: While the cobbler is baking, make the Chantilly. In the bowl of an electric mixer, whip the heavy cream, sugar, Cointreau and bitters at medium speed until the cream begins to thicken. Do not overbeat or the cream may turn into butter. Transfer to a sealed container and refrigerate until ready to use.Cook's note: The Chantilly can be refrigerated for up to 12 hours.Step 5: Remove cobbler from oven and let cool for 15 minutes, until warm. Spoon cobbler in dessert bowls, top with a dollop of Chantilly and serve.Cook's note: The cobbler can be made up to 6 hours ahead, and kept at room temperature in a cool place. To re-heat, bake for 6 to 8 minutes at 350ºF (177ºC) until just warmed. The cobbler can also be refrigerated up to 2 days, although refrigeration will make the dough a bit soggy."

4,FOOD & DRINK,America's Best Steakhouses,"The Daily Meal, Contributor
All things food and drink",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/americas-best-steakhouses_us_5b9d591fe4b03a1dcc86f05e,The finest steakhouses the country has to offer: must-visits for even the most casual carnivore.,2013-07-16,2013-07-15-12StElmoSteakHouseSteakWineStElmoSteakhouse.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-07-15-12StElmoSteakHouseSteakWineStElmoSteakhouse.jpg,"From a Minneapolis institution whose claim to fame is called the ""Silver Butter Knife Steak,"" to a 64-year-old San Francisco landmark that serves nothing but prime rib, America has no shortage of legendary steakhouses. Chef Mario Batali has a steakhouse in Vegas where he's aging steaks for over a year; a New Orleans power broker hangout tops their filet with fried oysters and béarnaise sauce; one Tampa legend offers seven different cuts in a total of 51 sizes, not to mention a 7,000-bottle wine list. We've searched far and wide for the finest steakhouses the country has to offer, and have found 20 that are must-visits for even the most casual carnivore (Credit: St. Elmo Steakhouse).Click here to see America's 20 Best SteakhousesThink of the word ""steakhouse"" and you're likely to immediately conjure one of a few mental images: red leather banquettes, gin martinis, and dark wood, possibly; or a sprawling room filled with folks in cowboy hats downing gargantuan rib-eyes and baked potatoes. No matter the environment, though, steakhouses all have one thing in common: they're unabashedly dedicated to the unbridled consumption of meat.Steakhouses are among the oldest types of American restaurants, developing in the United States in the late 19th century in several different formats thanks to a confluence of events: The construction of railroads allowed for fresh beef to be shipped all over the country from the major livestock hub of Chicago, by way of Kansas City, for the first time; stockyards all across the Great Plains were full of cattle, so naturally steak-centric eateries sprouted up on-site. At the same time, owners of inns and bars looking to serve food found an obvious choice in beef steaks. Meanwhile, Delmonico's restaurant in New York pioneered American fine dining as we know it, complete with the white tablecloth, wine list, clubby atmosphere, and private dining rooms.RELATED: The 40 Best Burgers in AmericaToday, we're lucky enough to live in an America that has more varieties of restaurants -- and steakhouses -- than previous generations could have ever imagined. There are the cavernous, Wild West-style temples to beef and the cowboy way of life; the clubby power-broker-with-an-expense-account meeting places; the ones that more closely resemble a bar that serves steak than anything else, and the airy, modernist steakhouses that turn all conventions on their head. All of these types of steakhouses are included in our ranking of America's best.The best steakhouses in America are nothing short of temples, shrines built to honor the deceptively complex art of a perfectly cooked steak. Whether they're clad in red leather or plywood, décor is only one aspect of the overall steakhouse experience; when it comes down to it, it's all about the steak.RELATED: 11 Biggest Failed Chain RestaurantsTo assemble our ranking of the best steakhouses in America, we first and foremost looked at the quality of the main event: the steak. Is it sourced reputably and USDA Choice or Prime? Is it dry-aged, and if not is it as fresh as can be? Is it served at the proper doneness without fail and with a touch of ceremony?We also not only considered the level of local and national renown, but the overall steakhouse experience, which is (almost) as important as the steak itself. No matter the setting, the service must be top-notch, the attention to detail should be spot-on, and diners should feel compelled to sit back in their chair after their meal, pleasantly stuffed and content in the knowledge that they just ate one heck of a steak.- Dan Myers, The Daily MealMore from The Daily Meal: America's 20 Best Lobster Rolls Outside of Maine The Ultimate Ice Cream Sandwich Taste-Test America's Best Ribs 15 Healthiest Frozen Dinners"
