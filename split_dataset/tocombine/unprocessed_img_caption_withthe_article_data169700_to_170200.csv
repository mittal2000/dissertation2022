It's covered extensively by the media and is given extra consideration because of the recent election as well as the Supreme Court's ruling on June 28th, 2012 to uphold the law. But how will it affect our personal finances?Basic Stipulations  According to a summary of the new health care act, 94 percent of Americans will be covered. This is in comparison to the fact that 18.4 percent of Americans younger than 65 didn't have insurance in 2010 according to CNN. The Act is sure to provide coverage where none is available or affordable to the majority of those currently without insurance.This legislation has a threefold strategy:  1. Elimination of preexisting conditions. 2. Americans must take part (with all but a few exceptions). It's thought that this will bring down costs because more healthy people (as well as unhealthy people) will be in the pool. 3. Tax-credits will make coverage affordable for those who currently can't make payments.Notable Details  The Act was passed in 2010 and according to this timeline implementation will continue until completion on January 1, 2015.Out-of-pocket requirements will be in line with Health Savings Accounts (effective 2014): HSA's can be used like an emergency fund for qualifying health care expenses, and they also have tax and other advantages. Ideally, the amount you deposit in the account will at least cover your deductible.Children will be considered dependent until age 26 (currently in effect): This way a 24-year-old adult child can be covered under their parents' insurance. Young adults have an additional option for coverage when they're getting started. If you can't get coverage elsewhere, this stipulation insures that if a major medical expense does arise, it won't put you at a deficit when you're trying to forge your financial future.Elimination of unreasonable benefit limits (partially in effect, full implementation 2014): Annual and lifetime coverage limits will be raised. This can have a profound impact on your finances if you have a serious medical issue that is extremely expensive. In other words, you'd be less likely to have to spend-down assets on medical expenses in a worst case scenario.Straightforward comparisons of insurance policies will be made readily available (currently in effect): This should help you choose coverage with greater clarity and help you find an insurance plan that provides the best value for your unique medical and financial circumstances.There will be fewer costs for basic preventative care (currently in effect): Services would include an annual doctor visit and a ""personalized prevention plan"" for seniors who qualify.Keep your current insurance (currently in effect): If you like the coverage you have in place, you can ""grandfather"" it and continue its use without any penalty.Long-term care insurance (effective October 2012): Voluntary long-term care insurance will be provided under the act called the ""community living assistance services and support (CLASS program)."" It will be interesting to see how competitive (in terms of costs and benefits) it will be in comparison to private offerings of long-term care coverage.Nursing School (partially in effect, full implementation 2014): Federal student loans for primary care and nursing school will be made more accessible and appealing.What are the penalties if you don't pay?  Most Americans will be required to hold nominal health insurance coverage or pay a fine of $95. That figure will rise quickly over the next two years to $350 in 2015 and $750 in 2016. However, there are some exceptions for religion and low income where you won't be required to pay the penalty.From my perspective as a certified financial planner, you need health insurance coverage whether or not the law requires it. Managing risk is an important element of improving your finances. The right kind of insurance covers what you can't afford to lose. That way, if something catastrophic happens, it doesn't wipe out the assets you are accumulating. Generally, this is true for other types of insurance in addition to health insurance.Almost certainly, there are other ways you might be affected by this legislation. For example, there will be provisions for rural communities. Also, coordination of services already offered under medicaid and medicare will be streamlined. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act is over 900 pages, so this post isn't a comprehensive overview. However, I hope it helps you stay informed so that you are in a better position when it comes to your personal and financial health!

But that hasn't stopped him from blogging a few choice words here and there about the financial crisis. He recently addressed the fiscal cliff in two posts on his ""Real Time"" blog, the first of which was more of a speculation on exactly when Obama is going to go completely grey. The second, ""The Fiscal Cliff Part II: Electric Boogaloo"", was, conversely, a straight explanation of what the fiscal cliff is, why it may not be quite as dire as sounds, and how Obama can use the crisis both to do something about global warming and to settle a score.Explaining the crisis, he says:I think most people have ""the fiscal cliff"" confused with the debt ceiling crisis. Really, they're opposites. Not raising the debt ceiling means not paying our debts. Going off the fiscal cliff means paying off our debt by raising taxes and cutting government spending. Well-advertised is the CBO saying going off the cliff could lead to a recession next year. Less advertised is that it also says it could get us into a more sound fiscal position in the long-term. Maher went on to offer a suggestion for how Obama could increase revenue:Since we're looking for new revenue streams that aren't income taxes, Obama should use this budget crisis -- if you can call it that -- to do something about global warming with a carbon tax.... And it would be just desserts for the oil and coal industries that went all in for Mitt Romney, a nice little personal fuck you to the Koch brothers.Read the full blog post here."

Kreamer said Johnson would be credited with the 1,062 days she has already served, leaving her about two years to complete behind bars. Upon her release, she must also serve four years probation, Kreamer said.Prior to sentencing, Johnson spoke on her own behalf. ""I am ashamed of the choices I have made ... I should have known better but at the time I did what I felt was right for [my son]. I regret taking Gabriel away from [his father] and for saying the things I said,"" Johnson said.Johnson said she gave her son away in Texas so he could be with a ""real, loving family.""""I have to live every day without my son and without knowing where he is,"" a tearful Johnson said. ""That is the worst pain and punishment I could ever have ... I am deeply sorry.""The baby's father, Logan McQueary, 25, also spoke in court, via a phone call to the judge.""I don't know what to say that has not already been said ... What Elizabeth has done has not only robbed me but my friends and family ... her actions hurt and changed people and their lives forever [and] I think Elizabeth should be held accountable for her actions,"" Logan said.Prosecutor Angela Andrews announced in court that her office was willing to set aside its recommendation of imprisonment if Johnson would reveal where her child is.The defense did not respond to Andrews' offer.Andrews described Johnson's actions as ""despicable"" and said she had caused ""amazing pain and suffering"" to the victims. ""She was a vindictive and scheming woman who used her child as a pawn ... Her actions demonstrated nothing but pure selfishness and vengeance,"" Andrews said.Gabriel was last seen on Dec. 26, 2009, according to police. Johnson, 26, and McQueary shared joint custody. On Dec. 27, the day McQueary was supposed to pick up his son, he said he received an ominous text message apparently from Johnson telling him their baby was dead.""You will never see Gabriel again,"" the text read. ""I made sure of that. And you can spend the rest of your pathetic life wondering about him. You will never find me. I'm already boarding a plane out of the country. When I'm safe, I'll email you the exact location of dead Gabriel's little blue body, if the garbage don't come first. This is what liars like you deserve.""Later that same day, police said, Johnson called McQueary to say that she had suffocated Gabriel and dumped his body in a trash can. ""I suffocated him. I suffocated him, and he turned blue, and I put him in his diaper bag and put him in the trash can,"" a woman identified by investigators as Johnson said in the audiotape they released.According to police, Johnson told McQueary that she had killed their child out of revenge because she believed McQueary was involved with other women. ""You want to talk to girls -- that's the price you pay,"" Johnson told her former boyfriend, according to police.Johnson also claimed he had destroyed her life, according to the audiotape. McQueary responded, ""I haven't destroyed anything."" Johnson replied, ""Yes, you have, Logan. You made me kill my baby boy ... So find some new girl to make your new baby.""The text message and phone recording prompted a massive search of local landfills by police, but they were unable to find the child.Johnson was arrested by police in Miami on Dec. 30, 2009, and charged with kidnapping and custodial interference.BABY GABRIEL CASE PHOTOS (Story Continues Below)In the days following her arrest, Johnson changed her story, telling police she had given Gabriel away to strangers in San Antonio, where her car was later found. But she never provided the couple's names. Witnesses have placed Johnson and the baby in the San Antonio area between Dec. 20 and 27, although she was alone when she turned up in Florida on Dec. 27, 2009.Gabriel's mother also implicated an Arizona woman named Tammi Smith, claiming that Smith helped set up the meeting with the San Antonio couple. Smith, 38, allegedly wanted to adopt Gabriel herself. In February 2010, Smith was arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit custodial interference after authorities discovered she had offered money to Johnson and forged court documents, police said.In mid-October of this year, a jury convicted Johnson of custodial interference and conspiracy to commit custodial interference. Jurors were unable to reach a verdict on the kidnapping charge and instead found Johnson guilty of a lesser count of unlawful imprisonment.After Johnson's conviction, her grandfather, Bob Johnson, told ABC15 that Gabriel's whereabouts will likely remain a mystery. Authorities still do not know if the child is alive or dead. ""I think that there's a real good possibility that we will never, I repeat, never know what happened,"" he said."

The auction began on Thursday.Chinese companies have launched $51.3 billion worth of outbound deals this year, making it Asia's second-biggest spender on overseas acquisitions behind Japan, according to Thomson Reuters data.While state-owned oil giants continue to dominate outbound deals, recently Chinese companies have targeted deals aimed at securing technology know-how. That shift is supported by China's five-year development plan that puts emphasis on industries such as high-end manufacturing equipment.Earlier this year, Shandong Heavy Industry Group agreed to buy a quarter stake in Germany's Kion Group, giving China access to industrial technology from the world's number two fork lift truck maker.Before that, Xuzhou Construction Machinery Group agreed to buy a majority stake in privately held German machinery manufacturer Schwing, while Sany Heavy Industry bought rival Putzmeister in a 360 million euro ($472 million) deal.Wanxiang, one of the largest non-government-owned companies in China, has annual revenue of more than $13 billion and supplies auto parts to many of China's largest automakers. POLITICAL BACKLASHNews of Wanxiang's winning bid comes only a day after the Canadian government approved a controversial deal allowing China's state-owned oil company CNOOC to buy energy company Nexen Inc for $15.1 billion..Wanxiang's approach for A123 had stirred a political storm and one U.S. politician was quick to warn about A123 and its sensitive, U.S. taxpayer-financed technology falling into the hands of a Chinese company.""Given the thin line between Wanxiang and the Chinese government, I am concerned about the government of China having access to sensitive technologies being used by our military forces,"" said a statement from Congressman Bill Huizenga, a Republican from Michigan where A123 has plants.The sale did not include parts of A123's business that works with the U.S. Defense Department, a source close to the deal said. That portion of the company went to another bidder, which the source did not identify.The sale must be approved by Delaware Bankruptcy Court judge Kevin Carey at a hearing scheduled for Tuesday.Opposition to the deal will likely focus on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which would need to approve the sale to Wanxiang.U.S. politicians and retired military leaders have already pressed the government panel to reject Wanxiang.Separately, the U.S. government has also said it must give its consent before its $249 million grant to A123 can be transferred to a new owner. The battery maker can still draw $120 million under various government grants, according to court records.It was unclear if the grant would be transferred to Wanxiang.A123, whose customers include Fisker Automotive, General Motors Co, BMW and the U.S. military, received the U.S. government grant as part of a program to promote clean energy.Wanxiang has had its eyes on A123 for a while. The Chinese company struck a $465 million investment deal meant to save A123 from bankruptcy earlier this year. That agreement fell apart after A123 failed to meet certain criteria, according to court documents.The Chinese company is no stranger to investing in the United States.Wanxiang generates about $1 billion in revenue in the United States by supplying parts to GM and Ford Motor Co and has bought or invested in more than 20 U.S. companies, many of them in bankruptcy, said a congressional report.Those past investments could help Wanxiang get approval to buy A123, but the deal will be closely scrutinized because it involves advanced technology, said Andrew Szamosszegi, who wrote the report for the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission.A123 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October.The money from the auction will go toward paying off A123's creditors. The company listed liabilities of $376 million when it filed for bankruptcy."

This month Vestas, the worldÂs largest turbine manufacturer, announced plans to cut 120 workers in Pueblo and Brighton blaming the stalled action on the wind energy tax credit. (AP Photo/Jack Dempsey, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2dfc725000094003890c4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Andrew Sipres spent much of the fall waiting to hear if he'd been let go. The Vestas plant in Brighton, Colo., where he worked manufacturing blades for wind turbines, had announced it was downsizing. What Sipres didn't know was who was getting axed.""We heard it was coming up, but we weren't sure when,"" said Sipres, a military veteran who received training through a federal green jobs program that helps veterans adjust to civilian life. ""One day we all showed up, we met in the lunchroom and they told us what was going on. Then one by one they took us into the office.""The layoffs at Vestas, one of the world's largest manufacturers of wind turbines, are the result of continued uncertainty over the fate of a crucial subsidy that makes wind power competitive with traditional sources of energy such as oil and gas. With the subsidy set to expire at the end of the year and Congress grappling with big-picture negotiations over taxes and spending, no one knows what rules will apply next year. While companies wait for clarity, major wind power projects are sidelined.All of which means that the companies that make the piece parts required to turn wind into electricity -- companies like Vestas -- are hunkering down, avoiding hiring and in some cases cutting their payrolls.Though Sipres' job was spared, Vestas laid off 80 of the workers at its Brighton plant in October. Hundreds more were let go from plants around Colorado as part of global cost-cutting measures meant to help stabilize the company's deteriorating finances.""The U.S. wind industry has slowed largely due to the uncertainty of the federal Production Tax Credit extension at the end 2012,"" explained Vestas in a statement at the time of the layoffs. ""This has led to a significant reduction in turbine orders for 2013, and the market slowdown is affecting Vestasâ manufacturing facilities in Colorado.""The so-called production tax credit, which has been in effect on and off since 1992, has spurred remarkable growth in the wind industry, with peaks and troughs reflecting times when the subsidy was allowed to lapse. The current credit of 2.2 cents per kilowatt-hour of wind electricity produced has been in effect continually since 2005.For now, the subsidy is tied up in negotiations around the ""fiscal cliff,"" the package of tax hikes and spending cuts scheduled to take effect at the end of the year. If the credit is renewed at the end of the month as part of Congressional bargaining, it could provide Vestas and others in the industry with a critical boost -- even as debt-laden governments in the U.S. and Europe have lost their appetite for providing financial support for such green projects.Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), who's helped lead the crusade for allowing the production tax credit to expire, described the credit as an ""outrageous waste of billions of dollars"" to Politico earlier this week. ""We could take that money and use it to help reduce the debt,"" he said. The Senate earlier this year passed a proposal for a one-year extension of the tax credit that will cost $12.1 billion over ten years.Republican Chuck Grassley, whose home state of Iowa is a top producer of wind energy, thinks the credit is an important investment in jobs. ""As much energy as possible -- both nonrenewable and renewable -- should be produced at home to create jobs and strengthen our national security,"" he told reporters at the Capitol last week. ""Itâs stupid to be importing as much oil as we do and spending as much as we do and shipping those dollars overseas to do harm in some ways to our national security.""Signs of an industry-wide slowdown are evident in other states as well: a wind developer in Ohio scrapped a project employing 200 construction workers this spring; a major turbine manufacturer in Kansas laid off more than 900 employees; and a wind tower maker announced plans to close plants in Nebraska and Washington. All told, if the tax credit is allowed to expire, it could mean the loss of some 37,000 jobs nationally, according to a study by Navigant Consulting.Sipres, 52, is worried about what comes next. ""When they're laying off so many people, everybody thinks they're one of them,"" he told HuffPost in an interview.The wind-power industry generated 3 percent of the nationâs electricity needs in 2011, according to the Energy Information Administration. Advocates say it is among the fastest-growing and cleanest energy sources available.""I'm always thinking positive,"" said Sipres, who served in the military for 24 years as a heavy equipment operator and quarry platoon sergeant before going back to school for green jobs training. ""It's going to continue on. Wind turbines, there are going to be wind turbines -- it's part of renewables. There's going to be solar energy -- all of these renewables are coming out. They're going to be there. That's the future. And so I have no doubts if not in this job -- if I end up getting laid off in the future -- then I've always got other things I can resort to, which would be renewables and energy-saving fields. You always have to think positive and go with it."""

All profits from the concert, which features performances by The Rolling Stones, Kanye West, Billy Joel, Eric Clapton, and Alicia Keys, among others, are supposed to benefit victims of the superstorm. However, when tickets to the event sold out in minutes, scalpers saw an opportunity for a quick profit of their own.While even the standard fee that Ticketmaster collects will be going to the concert beneficiary, the Robin Hood Foundation, there is no way to force the ticket scalpers to fork over their personal profits to the charity as well.New York's U.S. Senator Charles Schumer spoke out against the scalping and urged ticketing sites to keep scalpers from turning a profit on resales.âEvery dollar spent for these concert tickets should go to help the victims of Superstorm Sandy â not to line the pocket of unscrupulous scalpers,â Senator Schumer said in an statement. âTicket resale websites have the opportunity to make it much more difficult for scalpers to make money of this charitable event, and they should seize it.âCurrently, tickets are listed on StubHub for as much as $27,175. With the highest face-value price of a ticket reaching $2,500, scalpers are in a position to make an enormous profit. While StubHub is donating its service fees and commissions to the Robin Hood Foundation, it isn't regulating the reselling of tickets. NYT reports that StubHub's spokesman, Glenn Lehrman, said about the company's decision, âThis is going to take place regardless of whether we enable it or somebody else does, and at least by us enabling it, we can give a good portion to charity.âTicketmaster's resale sites, however, are not allowing tickets for 12-12-12 to be sold.""We proactively blocked all posts for 12-12-12 as is our policy for charitable events,"" a representative for TicketsNow and TicketExchange said in an email.âWe whole-heartedly applaud Senator Schumer for drawing attention to the disappointing activity on the secondary market for the 12-12-12 charitable event,"" reads a statement from Live Nation Entertainment, Ticketmaster's company. ""In addition to blocking thousands of IP addresses associated with BOTS for this onsale, we continue to review orders and are cancelling tickets that were bought by scalpers who violated our terms of use.""The televised 12-12-12 concert will be held at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday. A total of 34 networks will air the event on Wednesday night."

The archaeologist says the film used a replica of the skull in the film and collected ""illegal profits."" Dr. Jaime Awe, a real-life Indiana Jones and director of the Institute of Archeology of Belize, is suing on behalf of the country of Belize, according to THR. Awe is demanding the return of the crystal skull, which he says was stolen by the treasure-hunting family Mitchell-Hedges 88 years ago and used as a money-maker, as well as damages from ""illegal profits"" accrued by Disney, Lucasfilm, and Paramount for allegedly using a replica ""likeness"" in the 2008 Steven Spielberg film.Visit The Hollywood Reporter to read the full lawsuit. ""Lucasfilm never sought, nor was given permission to utilize the Mitchell-Hedges Skull or its likeness in the Film,"" reads the ""Indiana Jones"" lawsuit, obtained by THR. ""To date, Belize has not participated in any of the profits derived from the sale of the Film or the rights thereto."" Awe claims Belize has a ""right, title and interest in and to the Mitchell-Hedges Skull and its likeness"" and the film companies participated in a civil conspiracy and interfered with the country's economic advantage.The film grossed over $786 million worldwide, according to Box Office Mojo reports. However, the plot of the blockbuster doesn't even borrow from the story Awe tells. In ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull,"" Jones (Harrison Ford) finds the skull in Peru, not Belize, and it is described as having unspecified Native American heritage. Crystal skulls have been a source of mystery and controversy for decades, notes National Geographic. Although there are countless fakes, legend has it that authentic skulls have perceived supernatural powers. Scientists have been baffled by some findings, as they are unable to determine who made them, when or how. Awe's ""Indiana Jones"" lawsuit, though, may be moot. ""It's unlikely that the lawsuit will go anywhere -- mostly because (apparently unbeknownst to Awe) it's based on a famous hoax,"" notes Discovery's Benjamin Radford. Radford cites research conducted by Daniel Loxton, editor of Junior Skeptic magazine, on the history of the crystal skull. He found that Anna Mitchell-Hedges, the young girl who reportedly found the skull among ancient Maya ruins in the 1920s, changed her story multiple times. In actuality, she did not find the skull hidden in a jungle, but rather her father purchased it from an antiques collector. Thus, Belize would have no claim over it. "
10,ENVIRONMENT,"BP Oil Spill Flow Rate Vastly Understated For Weeks, Emails Show",John Rudolf,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bp-oil-spill-flow-rate-emails_us_5bb12a0ee4b09bbe9a5bcf90,"In a sworn statement released in April after Mixâs indictment, Barbara OâDonnell, an FBI special agent, said Mix deleted",2012-12-08,"FILE - In this Monday July 12, 2010 image from video made available by BP PLC, oil flows out of the top of the transition spool, which was placed into the gushing wellhead and will house the new containment cap, at the site of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. An April 20, 2010 explosion at the offshore platform killed 11 men, and the subsequent leak released an estimated 172 million gallons of petroleum into the gulf. (AP Photo/BP PLC)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb12a0e2600003600817809.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Emails that attorneys representing a defendant in the BP oil spill case plan to introduce in February show for the first time that the oil company knew the massive scale of the 2010 blowout in the Gulf of Mexico weeks earlier than previously disclosed.BP has long maintained that it provided full disclosure to the public and the federal government about its knowledge of the spillâs extent and did so promptly. The emails suggest otherwise.BP has said in the past that it learned of the spill's full extent months after the April 2010 blowout. But the emails indicate that the company knew almost immediately after the drilling rig exploded, killing 11 workers and injuring 17, that the spill may be extraordinarily large.BP pleaded guilty in mid-November to more than a dozen felony charges related to the spill, including lying to Congress about the size of the leak, as part of a wide-ranging deal settling the company's corporate criminal liability. Justice Department officials said a probe of individual criminal activity related to the spill is ongoing and may result in more indictments.Attorneys for one of those charged, a former BP engineer named Kurt Mix, a resident of Katy, Texas, are defending charges that Mix destroyed evidence showing that BP covered up the true extent of the 2010 spill. The lawyers asked a federal judge in New Orleans on Friday for permission to introduce at trial thousands of previously undisclosed emails and internal documents tied to the company's efforts to measure the undersea leak -- documents they say will exonerate Mix.Mix faces two felony counts of obstruction of justice for allegedly destroying hundreds of text messages sent to a supervisor during the the three-month gusher, including messages indicating that the flow of oil was far higher than BP publicly estimated at the time. His trial is scheduled for February.Defense briefs filed on Friday and last week by Mix's legal team contain new details about BP's extensive internal efforts to measure the size of the leak, which federal prosecutors contend were deliberately hidden from federal officials, Congress and the public. Mix did, indeed, share information with federal officials about the true size of the oil leak during and after the spill -- and that he therefore wasnât part of a cover-up, his attorneys argue.Just two days after the rig explosion, Mix emailed a projection to a supervisor estimating the runaway well could be leaking from 62,000 barrels per day to 146,000 barrels per day. Two days later, BP executives told the Coast Guard their best estimate for the leak was 1,000 barrels per day. A federal scientific group concluded after the well was capped that the flow was 62,000 barrels per day at the beginning of the disaster.In another email, dated May 10, 2010, an executive at a Norwegian energy consulting firm said he had analyzed video of the undersea leak sent to him by Mix. ""I do not think it can be ruled out that the flow at seabed is in the order of 40,000"" barrels per day, said the executive, whose name is redacted in Mix's brief. Four days later, Bob Dudley, BP's current chief executive, appeared on MSNBC with Andrea Mitchell and defended the company's flow rate estimate of 5,000 barrels per day, which it had provided to Congress and federal officials for weeks as the best estimate of the size of the leak. Independent experts saying the oil flow was much higher were ""scaremongering,â Dudley said.""Five thousand barrels a day, while inexact, is the best estimate of the industry experts,"" Dudley said.A spokesman for BP declined to comment on the emails in Mix's legal briefs, or on the ongoing Justice Department probe.In its guilty plea in November, BP acknowledged that it misled Congress about the size of the leak. But the only company executive indicted for lying about the flow estimates is David Rainey, a senior vice president who was BP's second in command in the oil spill response.Rainey was charged in November with two felony counts of obstruction of justice for lying to Congress and federal officials about internal BP attempts to measure the size of the leak. His trial is scheduled for Jan. 28, but his attorneys on Thursday requested a postponement.Rainey maintains his innocence and is prepared to fight the charges at trial, said Brian M. Heberlig, one of his attorneys. ""There's no plea in the works,"" Heberlig said.Joan McPhee, an attorney for Mix, said neither the defense nor prosecutors had objected to Mixâs February trial date, but declined to comment further.In the legal brief filed on Friday, Mix's legal team said the deletion of text messages by Mix were inadvertent and had nothing to do with BP's guilty plea to obstruction of Congress. The government has only accused Mix of deleting text messages -- not deleting emails or any other document.""The relevant question in this case is not whether BP executives lied to Congress or had a motive to do so, but whether Kurt Mix -- a non-executive line engineer -- had any plausible motive to corruptly obstruct the government's inquiry into such conduct by others,"" Mixâs lawyers said in their brief.In a sworn statement released in April after Mixâs indictment, Barbara OâDonnell, an FBI special agent, said Mix deleted numerous electronic messages related to the spill, after being ârepeatedly informed of his obligation to maintain such records.âCritics of BP praised the ongoing criminal prosecutions over the flow rate, saying it may shed important new light on the energy giant's corporate culture.""This is a central issue. It shows just how morally and ethically bankrupt institutions within BP were,"" said Tyson Slocum, director of the energy program for Public Citizen, a nonprofit advocacy group that has been harshly critical of BP's safety and environmental record."

Crippled transportation. Is this the new normal for coastal cities?Super storm Sandy is the latest demonstration of what may be two of the most significant long-term trends that will shape the 21st century: radically different weather patterns and the ever-increasing concentration of the world's population in urban areas. More than half of the people in the world now live in cities and that number is projected to reach 75 percent by mid-century. Many of those cities are built on or near major bodies of water. Their layout, infrastructure, and economies as well as the expectations of the residents who live in them are all based on assumptions built on historic patterns.Cities first were developed on the coast because it afforded easy access to transportation, commerce, and food sources. Now we are more smitten than ever with the coast for the spectacular views and prestige that proximity allows. There is no better way to boost the price of a piece of real estate than to be able to say, ""water view.""But what if the ""100-year storm"" becomes the ""10-year storm""?That may seem alarmist until you begin to string together the many events that are often viewed as isolated incidents instead of possible systemic changes: Katrina, Irene, Sandy and many more in between. It is impossible to tie any single storm to climate change though each of these are consistent with many projections of new weather patterns by those who study the topic: more frequent, more intense storms taking new paths as a result of shifts in air and water temperatures and currents. Some climate models project that New Orleans and Miami will be completely underwater within 75 to 300 years thanks to rising sea levels. Severe weather events are now occurring at about four times the historic average: welcome to ""big weather.""If the ""big weather"" phenomenon is real, some of the most valuable real estate in the United States -- lower Manhattan, for example -- may become unsuitable for its current level of residential or commercial activity. Real estate values may, however, be the least of our concerns. In the aftermath of Sandy, it was easy to see the significant challenges in public health, the economy, education, and every other facet of people's lives.In the developed world, financial constraints and competing priorities make it difficult to invest and reorient ourselves toward big weather resilience. In the developing world, where much of the urban growth over the coming decades will occur, both the human and physical systems are even less well prepared and more lacking in resources.Response and recovery from a mega-event like Sandy means far more than clearing debris and providing food and shelter to the affected individuals. Leading experts are calling for a fundamental rethinking of how we plan, build, and inhabit our coastal cities for an environment where mega-disruptions occur far more frequently.""Resilience"" is on the lips of policymakers, architects and planners, executives, and elected officials. Ideas range from designing infrastructure better suited to a big weather environment to shifting governance to reflect the real risks of coastal living and the limits of both private insurance and government resources to mitigate those risks.The Forum at the Harvard School of Public and The Huffington Post are convening some of the experts with expertise in these issues on Monday, December 10 for a panel discussion of the issues coastal cities face in an age of big weather and how they can be addressed. Richard Serino, FEMA Deputy Administrator, Paul Biddinger, Director, Emergency Preparedness and Response Exercise Program, Harvard School of Public Health, Jerold Kayden, Professor of Urban Planning and Design, Harvard Graduate School of Design, and Daniel Schrag, Director of the Harvard University Center for the Environment, will participate. Tom Zeller, Jr., Senior Writer at The Huffington Post, will moderate. The panel will be broadcast live on the Web at www.ForumHSPH.org from 10-11:00 a.m (ET)., and you can email questions to them ahead of time to theforum@hsph.harvard.edu.The questions they must answer are not only what ""things"" are needed, but how we can catalyze the necessary political courage and social and regulatory changes. For coastal cities to be resilient in the face of Sandy and her big weather siblings there must be significant adaptation and perhaps fundamental transformation of attitudes and behaviors as well as bridges, tunnels, and buildings.Eric J. McNulty is Senior Associate at the National Preparedness Leadership Initiative at Harvard. He is also completing a Master's degree in leadership in the context of mega-system challenges such as climate change and urbanization."
