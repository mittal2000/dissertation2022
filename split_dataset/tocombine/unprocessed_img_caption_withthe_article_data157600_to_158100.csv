Yesterday was yet another tragic day that we will remember forever as a life marker. Millions of people in Boston, across the country and around the world saw the repeating images of the horror and destruction as the day's events unfolded. Yet another day when many families' lives were forever shattered, unforgettable images permanently stored, innocence lost, and unbearable pain felt. The stories will be shared over and over and over. Every generation is permanently branded by those ""do you remember"" questions. You remember those questions you asked your parents or grandparents when you were little. Some were real and actually happened during their lifetimes -- where were you during the Depression, when the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, during the Cuban Missile Crisis, or when JFK was shot. Maybe it is from my perspective as a parent of teenagers that makes me feel as if these horrible events are happening more and more. They are starting to feel commonplace in terms of timing, but they never get any easier to digest or process. Oklahoma City, Columbine, 9/11, Aurora, Newtown, and Boston... how do we stop the madness? And we hold our collective breath waiting to know something about the perpetrators -- as if there could be any explanation for maiming innocent people, killing children whose only mistake was being outside on a beautiful day on the wrong street corner on the wrong day. And wondering (but not wanting to) where the next danger will come from.I run through a mental checklist with each horrible event, and I did the same thing yesterday. I took attendance in my mind to keep track of family members, calling or texting (depending on their age) immediately. I texted my nephew who is in school in Boston, who went with a bunch of friends to see Marathon Monday. Thankfully, he was safe. I called friends whose children are in school there. I checked Facebook. I reached out to friends of friends and they to me. Our automatic reactions were to reach out and just touch the people in our lives. Many of us are suffering personally or know someone who is suffering. How will our children mark and measure time in their childhoods? Memories of games won, schools attended, family occasions, Super Bowls watched -- the normalcy (if there is such a thing) and chaos of daily life. Or will their dominant memories be recalling the most specific detail of 9/11 and its horrific aftermath, images of the Iraq War or an underlying fear that they carry with them? My son came home yesterday and said, ""I remember where I was when the Newtown shooting happened. And now I know where I was during the 'Marathon Bombing.'"" When did ""teaching kids how to deal with terrorism and violence"" became such a big part of our modern parenting curriculum?Sending love, prayer and hopes of healing to Boston and the community of those suffering."

How do we break this cycle of insanity that is striving to become the norm in our world? After September 11 I was sure we would stay united and strong in our fight against evil. I was sure the lives lost that day would become our shepherds for humanity. Angels that would guide us toward love for each other -- not more hatred. I was sure the deeply twisted members of the human race that were capable of this apathetic attitude for life, would become the monsters that they are in the eyes of all -- not mentors for up-and-coming evil. I didn't expect that the terror that struck us that day would ignite a chain reaction of sick minds that gain some kind of pathetic meaning in their lives from their heinous, hateful, murderous acts.One of my greatest fears about life today is that the young people and small children that are growing up with this insanity being the norm will come to think that it is. How many times can a young, forming mind have their psyche attacked with bombs, gunfire, or airplanes crashing through buildings before they accept that it is just another part of life, a piece of their existence, something to accept? Watch enough scary movies, and you stop being afraid. We need to counter these horrific acts with examples of the opposite. For years I have been saying we are offering ugliness to our children in the name of entertainment and it is going to take its toll. In a sense, the media coverage that these sick individuals get from their pathetic actions are their shot at being the next reality TV star. We have in the name of freedom allowed poison to leach into the minds of our most precious resource -- our children. I don't know if this recent act is domestic or foreign. I don't know if it was concocted to bring fear or to display hatred. What I do know is that we need to do a much better job of bringing out examples of the good that exists in our world. I'm not saying that this rash of callousness towards life falls on the shoulders of the media, but I am saying they have more power than me, and you, to do something about it. We need to start being responsible for what our kids get to see as the norm by putting a better example out there for them -- and why not start with the big flatscreens that hang on our living room walls? Maybe it is time for the ""reality"" we are consuming to more closely resemble the reality we would like to be living, and more importantly, have our children and grandchildren grow up with. I know there are some people out there that are trying to make this happen -- but we all know that majority rules. I don't think any peace-loving person can disagree that things need to change, and they need to change on many levels -- let's not be naïve enough to think that it only lies in the hands of the law. While lawmakers do what they need to do to bring change, we need to do our part. Let's be responsible grownups. Let's remember that just like when you feed a nation junk food, their bodies become riddled with disease -- so do our minds when filled with horror, despair, and indifference. I am not going on the attack here, this is not a ""put up your dukes -- I'm ready for battle"" point of view. This is about humanity and an idea that I have that we need answers, not battles. My thought is create more of what we want out there. So come on, Hollywood -- what can you do with your money and star-power to save the planet? Sounds like the making of a good flick to me!

In the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings",2013-04-16,BOSTON - APRIL 19: A boy takes a rest at the finish line of the Boston Marathon. (Photo by Tom Herde/The Boston Globe via Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d0e603c00005b0009ff41.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Carole Tedesco, an attorney from Winchester, Mass., was sitting in the Prudential Skywalk watching the Boston Marathon with her children when she heard the blasts, just seconds apart.Her kids, Luca, 9, and Isabella, 8, thought it was thunder. Carole knew it wasn't. She thought the building might have been hit. The building's loudspeaker announced that there would be a ""shelter in place"" due to ""criminal activity in the neighborhood."" The term ""shelter in place,"" a common school drill refrain, triggered Luca's fear. ""What's going on?"" Luca asked, frantically. He started crying. An off-duty cop speculated that they were going to be stuck in the building all day, which only elevated Luca's worries.""I'm afraid they're going to come in with guns and shoot us,"" Luca said.Carole reassured him that it wasn't that type of attack. But as she recalled the next day, Luca's mind kept returning to Newtown. When the family finally left the building, Luca kept thinking he was walking into an unsafe situation. Carole promised him that he was going be home that night to sleep in his bed with Flora, his favorite stuffed animal -- but in the back of her mind, as she heard the sirens blaring, she wasn't sure if she could deliver.By the time they finally got home, Carole and her husband had instituted a media ban. ""They don't need to see any more dead kids after Newtown,"" she said. ""When we talked to them, we tried to put it in the context of bad things happen but not that often. But it's very hard to sell that. It seems like we were just telling them that in December.""In the aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombings, parents in Boston and across the country are struggling to explain the senselessness of the attack to their children. Around Boston in particular, parents are put in a unique situation, since there is a school break this week. During school-day crises, teachers can be first responders, and they are often taught how to break potentially traumatizing news to children. And to parents outside Boston, while the pain might not feel as close to home, determining age-appropriate vocabulary for tragedy less than six months after the Newtown massacre is particularly troubling. This time, parents themselves know even less about what caused the incident.Though schools are not in session, Carol Johnson, the superintendent of Boston Public Schools, sent a memo to parents advising them to limit their children's news consumption, to let children ask questions and express their feelings, and to answer their questions with facts in ""age-appropriate"" language. ""Our city is full of heroes and we are thankful for every one -- and we are thankful for you, too,"" she wrote. ""We look forward to seeing you back at school next week.""Letting children verbalize their concerns can help blunt the impact of their feelings, said Anthony Mancini, a Pace University psychology professor who focuses on grief and trauma. ""Children do have the capacity to bounce back, and experiencing something horrific like the Boston Marathon … is not a sentence of trauma by any stretch at all,"" he said. ""Most children will do fine in the way that most adults would do fine."" While children who witnessed the explosion first-hand could face some degree of post-traumatic stress disorder, Mancini said, children are often resilient and bounce back.Joy Budewig Harms, a Boston speech pathologist, hopes that's the case. Though some psychologists recommend sheltering kids from media exposure during tragic events, Harms had no choice. Her four-year-old daughter, Clara, kept asking questions, eventually getting her hands on a copy of the Wall Street Journal, Harms said. While Harms had explained to Clara that something bad happened at the marathon, people were hurt, and the good guys were trying to make sure it never happened again, Clara focused in on the WSJ photo she saw. ""Are those people hurt? What happened?"" she asked.""It's hard keeping it from her. I wish her view were true -- that it's good guys versus bad guys -- but it's not that simple,"" Harms said. ""This week, violence is in Boston, but it's always happening in Pakistan, Syria, all over the world. We would like to keep our children from that experience, but we have to start shepherding them through this concept early in their lives,"" she said, as she started to cry.That simplistic children's view also affected Cheryl Stober, an investment firm product analyst in Newton, Mass. ""If I told my son there were bad guys in the city, he's going to want to run out the door and karate-chop them,"" she said. ""It's easier for him not to hear."" Stober's 9-year-old daughter, though, was aware of the event: She was with her father in his office when Stober called. Stober's husband shared with their daughter that there was a bomb at the marathon, but that mom was safe. The family learned soon afterwards that the 9-year-old's teacher, who was running the marathon, was safe as well. Stober's daughter will spend time later this week at a local daycare center, Bright Horizons.Ilene Serpa, vice president of communications at Bright Horizons, said her employees were careful to not expose kids to the news of the day. ""We want to make sure we're providing supports for our employees, letting them take time off if they need,"" she said. Bright Horizons has 12 centers in Boston, and many of them were open late on Monday since parents weren't able to get to their kids. ""Teachers are doing what's best for kids at a young age: protecting them from the news,"" Serpa said. Anne Zeiser, a media professional in Lynnefield, Mass., a Boston suburb, tried to do the same. ""I turned off the television,"" she said. ""Watching tragic events can have a cumulative effect."" After she explained to her 8-year-old what had happened, she took him out for a bike ride, she said. On Tuesday, she sent him to her town's recreational program. ""I want to help him process it over the week. I want to tell him there are heroes, and we love each other."""
5,WELLNESS,Why Dating Is Sometimes Like Dieting,"Elisabeth Joy LaMotte LICSW, Contributor
Founder, DC Counseling and Psychotherapy Center",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dating-advice_us_5b9cdf08e4b03a1dcc8296eb,"This is a common phenomenon among both men and woman who claim that all they want is a happy relationship, and they lament that this wish is never fulfilled.",2013-04-15,"Young brunette woman with a bar of chocolate in one hand and an apple in the other, close-up",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cdf082400003100535eb7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the most interesting aspects of my work as a therapist is how much I learn from my clients. The insights clients make about the challenges they face can often combine with the theory and practice of therapy to genuinely help others.Years ago, I worked with an engaging young woman who was struggling to find a happy, healthy relationship. She easily, breezily summarized her challenge: ""My sorority sisters say my problem is that I keep dating candy bars when what I really need is an apple. Their advice makes perfect sense. A candy bar looks so good when you first see it, and I crave it with passion, but whenever I have it I end up feeling sick and disappointed. I know that apples are much healthier, but I don't crave them with the same sense of longing."" This succinct summary of her dating pattern is one that I observe time and time again, among both men and woman who claim that all they want is a happy relationship, and they lament that this wish is never fulfilled. And yet, when exploring their dating history in more detail, they will frequently admit to a pattern of actively choosing unavailable or otherwise unsuitable partners. The psychological theories related to this phenomenon are quite interesting. Systems theory might hypothesize that a happy, reliable relationship is not something that is familiar, and so it makes someone uncomfortable. Freud might wonder if the client is unconsciously repeating a painful pattern from the past with a fantasy that they might fix it and therefore heal old wounds. According to this theory, such fantasies are rarely successful and usually involve compulsively repeating something painful from the past and opening and reliving old wounds. Behavioral theory talks about learned behavior. Cognitive theory explores how one's thoughts about one's self and others play into the relationship experience. Regardless of the theoretical approach that a therapist uses to explore why the pattern occurs and how to change it, the language of candy bars and apples is a compelling way to begin the conversation. Many times, the stated problem in therapy is, in fact, the opposite of what a client claims. In other words, if someone says they are in pain as they long for an intimate relationship, they may actually mean that they are terrified to be in a close and committed relationship. Fortunately, my client gave me permission to share the metaphor of candy bars and apples with others. When I presented this concept to another client she shook her head and replied:""That's me, an overeating candy bar addict! If I date a functional man I can literally feel the walls closing in around me... I secretly love unavailable men. I love to look like the good one dating the mess. That way when things fall apart no one blames me. Also, you can't fear having the rug pulled out from you when there is no rug."" What are signs that you are dating a candy bar? While inconsistency, cruelty or unavailability are obvious signs, the best way to determine for sure is to write down the five qualities that are most important to you in a partner. Then think about the last five people you dated. Highlight the qualities you claim to be important that are not present in those you dated. The greater number of these qualities that are lacking, the greater likelihood that you are dating candy bars. If you discover that you tend to choose candy bars over apples, keep in mind that you are therefore playing an active role in your unsatisfactory relationships. Choosing an unsuitable partner can be just as destructive as being an unsuitable partner. If you own your part in the problematic pattern, you can begin to practice dating apples and slowly train yourself to adjust to a new and healthier dating diet. I say ""train"" intentionally as making any significant change -- diet or otherwise -- involves hard work, commitment, discomfort and persistence that is similar to training for a marathon. Apples might taste strange at first, but if you stick with it and push through the discomfort, you will notice, with time and hard work, that you will begin to crave them. Before you know it, you will want to delete candy bars from your diet.

Minibar/E by Jose Andres -- Washington, D.C./Las Vegas",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cfc001f0000500021701a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"So much of food writing is restaurant recommendations. Telling people where to eat is as much the central task of food writers as telling people what team won the game is the central task of sports writers. (Both types have other important roles to play as well, of course -- profiles, industry news, trends -- but it's all essentially subsidiary.) As a result, there are more guides to restaurant quality than anyone knows what to do with. More rankings, it sometimes seems, than good restaurants to rank. Who thinks we need more? Steve Plotnicki, for one. Or at least he thought so in 2008, when the former music industry executive started his ""Opinionated About Dining"" ranking of the best restaurants in the world. Plotnicki released his fifth edition of the list of the best restaurants in America in the middle of March. And it makes a good case for itself not only as useful, but, for a certain kind of enthusiastic diner, the best list of its kind around.In a call with The Huffington Post, Plotnicki explained that he initially devised his list as an alternative to the Michelin Guide that he hoped would do a better job comparing top-tier restaurants in different parts of the world.""Before I started this, there was a lack of head-to-head comparisons in restaurant guides,"" he said. ""So if there were a restaurant in Cleveland that was really highly rated somewhere, it was hard to tell how it compared to a restaurant in New York."" Plotnicki agreed with Michelin that his list should based on the opinions of a moderately-sized pool of experienced diners. (As opposed to most newspapers and magazines, which publish the opinions of one very experienced diner, and organizations like Yelp and Zagat, which canvas thousands of not-so-experienced diners.) But Plotnicki uses a pool that's very different from Michelin's anonymous, professional inspectors, who are assigned to rate the restaurants in one city or region every year. He polls people who are extremely enthusiastic diners and devote a significant portion of their time and money to traveling the world in search of the very best meals on the planet. (It's a hobby that requires a lot of money, but most of the people who participate most enthusiastically in the survey are attorneys, professors, doctors -- not billionaires.) Plotnicki met many of these gastronauts in the early nineties as the founder of a niche-y online forum -- Opinionated About -- dedicated to fine dining.Plotnicki devised an algorithm that weights each diner's reviews of restaurants by that diner's level of experience. Essentially, the more ""important restaurants"" a diner visits, the more his or her review sways any given restaurants' ranking, for good or ill. Plotnicki's hunch is that eating at more top restaurants gives diners the perspective to judge new ones in a broad context. So although anyone can participate in his survey, the top 100 restaurants are largely decided by the 75-or-so diners who are the most devoted to the survey.""These are people who eat between three and four dozen and 100 'important meals' a year,"" he said. ""Who, if you were to name the top five or six restaurants in the U.S., France, Spain and Scandinavia, would have been to almost all of them, if not all of them."" Over the years, Plotnicki has consulted with several statisticians to refine his algorithm. One of them is none other than Nate Silver, the statistical wizard behind 538. He and Plotnicki dined together at top New York sushi restaurant Sushi Yasuda and discussed, as Plotnicki recalls, ""how to reduce human experience to number."" Silver -- a veteran diner himself -- came away impressed.""If you're a foodie, I think you'll be better getting recommendations from other foodies,"" Silver told The Huffington Post. ""It doesn't necessarily apply if you don't eat out much, or if expensive restaurants turn you off. But in my experience, the recommendations have been very good.""Silver pointed out that, because restaurant quality is always subjective (unlike the outcome of elections), it's impossible to say which restaurant ranking is the best one in any absolute sense. But you can evaluate different rankings for different purposes. Opinionated About Dining's list, he said, is most useful for people whose preferences match those of the people who do the ranking -- that is, highly motivated, experienced diners who can afford to spend hundreds of dollars and several hours on a revelatory dinner. ""It's a good approach for serious foodies looking for a serious meal,"" Silver said. Indeed, the list ended up being uncompromisingly elitist. Almost all the top restaurants on the list focus on tasting menus. (By my count, only one of the top 10, McCrady's in Charleston, S.C., even offers an a la carte menu.) Most are located in a major urban area on the coast. Many are tough reservations. There are possibly too many sushi restaurants, which Plotnicki chalked up to the fact that most sushi restaurants spend a relatively high percentage of their revenue on ingredients rather than fancy service or decor.In other words, it's not the guide to consult if you're looking for the best barbecue stand in Texas. (That's what Texas Monthly is for!) But it's safe to say that all the restaurants in the top 50 or 100 offer excellent, one-of-a-kind dining experiences, and that almost all the food you'll eat at any of them will be good. And the restaurants in the top 10 or so go beyond even that high threshold; they represent the vanguard of fine dining today, and are pushing the envelope for what restaurants can offer. As Plotnicki said, by way of summary, ""When you look at the top of the list, you get a very good idea of what direction cuisine is taking today.""Click through below to find out what they are:"

Both experiences served to significantly affect my perception of what one really needs to own in order to get on. Yet I have also seen that many other individuals around the world are slowly but surely altering their outlook on spending, and consumerism overall.This shift in focus has emerged chiefly as a result of how value is being defined. Of course there are still folks out there who buy $250 sunglasses, and throw $6 million parties (and I know this for a fact, as an avid reality TV viewer with a dreadful thirst for cringeworthy irony and a passion for anthropology); but I'm not talking about those who are trapped in garish '80s greed disguised as noughties minimalist sheen. I'm talking about those who have already moved on, and are continuously moving forward, and without really trying, bringing the majority of the world toward a refreshing new direction.Do I really want to shop for a $2 chicken that has lived its insignificant existence barely managing to stand in its own feces while being pumped with antibiotics to fight the hundreds of septic diseases it's susceptible to because of its filthy living conditions at the ""farm,"" and with hormones to make it double its natural size so it can provide more, cheaper meat for my Thai curry? Do I really need that glossy pair of pumps sold for 8,000 times more money than the 10-year-old factory slave who made it in one of China's thriving factories could possibly ever even dream of? I think you know which way I'm heading. These are some of the obvious ethical considerations more people are taking, thus reassessing the worth or true need of what they buy, and are sold into.Another reason for the re-evaluation of value today is that we are seeing governments, corporations and banks around the globe screwing up more and more at the cost of everyday people who have dedicated their lives to ""doing the right thing"" by society. As the ugly truth about their destructive purposes and practices increasingly rises to the surface of a boiling socioeconomic melting pot like scum, a new possibility has dawned upon us: If in fact for them it's all about things like oil and gas, human trafficking and slavery, gold, diamonds, weapons and cocaine, then it's apparent that all our governments really care about is money. We always knew that money was of prime importance to our governments, but many of us never believed (or wanted to believe) that it was their driving force, their raison d'etre. We would have liked to believe that their driving force was to realize ideals that can make everyone happy, functional and progressive, as individuals, societies, nations, as a world, in an organized, honest, fair and pragmatic manner; that wars were only the very final answer at the most final of hours, and even then should be diffused before it has really begun. Since we realize that essentially money is what directly interests, directs and secures the super-powers that rule our lives, we could start recognizing another dimension to our spending, with a new kind of awareness. We could begin considering that if local and world politics alike revolve around our spending, then there exists an infinite potential to where and how we spend, so that where we put our cash directly becomes our vote. If we resolutely don't buy it, we can push for producers to come up with something we will be interested in investing in instead.And yet another catalyst for the redefinition of value is that by now we all know enough about the cocky strategy of advertisers and the tricks (and results) of consumer brainwashing, and we don't like feeling stupid or manipulated. A yogurt will not make you look like a toned model who goes on a lot of hot dates, a chocolate bar will not make your kids stop shrieking or give you an orgasm, fabric softener is sweet-smelling chemical sludge and has nothing to do with bright spring days, blooming daisies or fluffy teddy bears. Even if adverts have become more intelligent, witty, emotionally evocative and visually sophisticated, we can still work out what they are selling and generally know what manufacturing that product involves. Most of us know this and still outright ignore at least some of these itchy realities, because after all, spending on a feel-good dream can feel utterly rewarding. But more and more people sense a growing discomfort when they hand over their credit card at the till, at least sometimes, and it's not just about their gilded guilt over spending money they should be saving/spending on far more pertinent things, but also about a sense of knowing they don't really need what they will be bringing home with them, as it is eventually going to just sit there taking up space. Breathing and living space.I mentioned the farm experience earlier, and now I would like to elaborate on that a little. Before my husband and I moved into the cozy cottage in the olive grove with stunning skylines, we were living in a prime spot of Athens overlooking the city from an apartment three times the size. We managed to fit some of our furniture and decorative knickknacks into the cottage, but there was only room for our essential belongings. We didn't miss anything that we had left behind in Athens, as it turned out there was nothing more we needed. It was also exhilarating to be recycling almost everything we used and putting all our food scraps into compost or chicken feed. We had also once lived in an apartment in the stunning W Hotel in Doha, Qatar, on a four-month work project, where we had even less of our stuff, just clothes really, and the experience had been the same -- easy. A particular event that happened while we lived in oliveland propounded this liberating new awareness of minimalist living: On one of our visits back to urbanity we arrived at our apartment to find the front door had been hacked open and every one of those spacious rooms was completely covered in our stuff, thrown onto the floor by thieves, who had emptied out every drawer, cupboard and wardrobe. It was not only a chilling shock to have been robbed, but also to realize just how many things we had gathered, hoarded, more like, and tucked away over the years, stuff we had to go through one by one to then finally discard or clean and put away again. I am not trying to advocate a Spartan life -- in this sometimes humdrum life, a super-comfy designer armchair, a succulent delicacy at a trendy new restaurant, a glossy book, a rare quirky wine or a trip to an exotic location and other such things can be extremely valuable additions to one's state of inner balance and bliss. If something brings us pleasure, comfort and joy, we should reach out for and enjoy it. But not at all costs, and not at any cost. Not for the sake of achieving yet another momentary indulgence that we don't really care about, because then it is no longer of real value. Then it becomes no more than a cheap thrill.For more by Alexia Amvrazi, click here.For more on wisdom, click here."

With childhood obesity rates so high, we need effective strategies to help youngsters eat more healthfully and eat less.The study, published in the journal Pediatrics, found that plate size matters, at least for first-graders. The research was conducted at lunchtime on first-graders. Eighty percent of children served themselves 90 more calories when using large, adult-sized plates than when using smaller plates. And the students ate about half of the additional calories that they piled onto the plate. According to the researchers, the additional calories on these bigger plates were probably carbohydrates or protein, as kids did not usually serve themselves extra vegetables.These results make perfect sense to me as a nutrition researcher tracking portion-size trends. As I wrote in my book The Portion Teller Plan, the sizes of plates have increased in recent years, and could certainly be an additional contributor to the obesity epidemic in our country. When given a larger plate, consumers tend to pile on more food. Indeed, research from Cornell University conducted on adults found that people eat more off of larger plates. They found that a food portion looks smaller when it is placed on a large plate. And this new study confirms this phenomenon in kids. I often suggest to clients in my private practice to eat off of downsized dishes. Using a smaller dish makes a smaller portions look like more food. And dieters do not want to stare at a half-empty plate. It makes them feel deprived. When one of my clients started eating off of her grandmother's dishes, she began to lose weight. She ate less without even realizing it. Another suggestion that I offer clients is to use a larger plate for salad (a great way to increase your veggie consumption) and use a smaller plate for the main dish. This way, you do not have to go out and buy new dishes.Divide-and-conquer is another great approach when thinking about your plate. As USDA's dietary guidance icon MyPlate suggests, fill half of your plate with fruits and veggies, one-quarter with healthy grains such as brown rice or quinoa, and one-quarter with protein-rich foods such as grilled fish or chicken.One caveat: When using a smaller plate, remember not to pile on your food. If food can fall off of the plate, you probably served yourself too much.For more by Dr. Lisa Young, click here.For more on personal health, click here."

We battle every weekend, when I try to get them to do a big clean up. What can I do to avoid these power struggles?Children make messes. They move from one activity or outfit to another, rarely considering that by returning whatever they were playing with or wearing to its shelf or drawer, they could easily keep their rooms clean. ""Later"" becomes their motto, meaning their rooms can quickly turn into disaster areas.Here's my advice:• Don't lecture. Let's start by facing facts: many children are completely oblivious to the chaos in their rooms. This means that all the lectures in the world about how they should want their rooms to be neat will fall on deaf ears. While you may have a problem with their messy rooms, they don't. Give up on trying to convince your kids that they should care more about their rooms than they actually do. While it's perfectly fine for you to want things to look nice, you will only frustrate yourself if you try to convince your children that they have a problem they don't believe they have.• Make it fun. Most children shut down when faced with what feels to be an unnecessary and overwhelming task. I remember times when I would sit down in the middle of my messy room and cry when I was told to clean it up. Put on lively music and invite your kids to boogie while they tidy up. Create a contest over filling the trash bag or laundry hamper. Pretend you're the Queen of Hibbyjibbyland, and they are preparing their rooms for a royal visit. By lightening the mood, you'll help them switch their brains on to cooperate in tackling the clean up job.• Chunk it down. Most kids are more willing to do something unpleasant when they know they only have to do it for a short burst of time. Instead of having your children do marathon cleanups on the weekend, try creating a routine of cleaning up for six minutes on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. • Set clear expectations. Come alongside your kids with a specific request, rather than at them with criticism. ""Kids, I know you don't mind having crumpled up papers on the floor or toys hiding under your bed, but that doesn't work for me. Three times a week, we're going to each spend six minutes tidying up. Here is a list of what that includes: Putting laundry in the hamper, running the vacuum, picking up toys from under the bed.""• Go on a ""stuff"" diet. Some children simply have more toys, books and clothes than they can manage. If your kids' rooms are overflowing, consider rotating what is on their shelves and in their closet, swapping toys and t-shirts every couple of weeks so they have less to put away. A side benefit to this is that the things that were stored elsewhere for a little while will be more appealing when they reappear in their rooms for their rotation.• Appreciate cooperation. When your children do comply with your request to tidy up, offer your appreciation. We all are more motivated when our efforts are acknowledged. ""Thanks, guys, for pitching in with so much energy. Your rooms look so much nicer; it's a real pleasure to come visit you now!"" • Allow frustration. Your kids may complain about having to do a job that they feel is a waste of their precious time. Avoid lecturing and simply acknowledge -- without drama, fanfare or lectures -- that they would rather be playing. It is important that children learn to manage the mundane tasks of life. These tips should help you avoid those power struggles and have a tidier house!Do you have a question for the Parent Coach?

Parker is reportedly planning a $9 million wedding, according to TMZ. The nuptials will take place on the weekend of June 1 at the Ventana Inn & Spa in Big Sur, Calif. He will be marrying fiancee, Alexandra Lenas. What does $9 million buy you? Fake ruins, waterfalls, bridges, ponds and a gated cottage, TMZ reports. He has allegedly spent $600,000 on an entrance gate, $350,000 on the dance floor and more than $1,000,000 on plants and flowers. The New York Post previously reported that Parker and Lenas' wedding guests will wear custom-made costumes. “There will be some kind of medieval theme, and guests will each get their own costumier,"" a source told the Post. ""It’s not yet fully decided what the costumes will be like, the theme is supposed to fit in with the environment and the natural beauty of the area. But, yes, there is a chance the wedding could end up looking like an episode of ‘Game of Thrones.’”The Spotify investor later revealed ""Lord of the Rings"" costume designer Ngila Dickson is creating the threads for the ceremony, but he clarified that the theme is more ""Victorian flair and whimsy"" than medieval. He posted the response to Facebook, writing: Sorry to disappoint those of you who were looking forward to dressing up in medieval garb, but the wardrobe designs we've made for our guests are essentially modern. This is NOT a theme wedding and there will be nothing ""medieval"" about it. Academy award winning costume designer Ngila Dickson created a series of outfits for everyone that are based on modern suits and dresses with some elements of victorian flair and whimsy; however they are not at all ""medieval.""If the reports are true, his nuptials will stand in stark contrast to Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan's low-key wedding, which took place in the backyard of their Palo Alto, Calif. home in 2012. They said their vows in front of just 100 guests and served food from their favorite local restaurants. Parker and Lenas got engaged in April 2011. She gave birth to their first daughter, Winter Victoria, in January. The 33-year-old Parker has a net worth of $2 billion, according to Forbes. "
12,PARENTING,"Introducing Your Children to Social Media, the Expert's View","Tony Loftis, Contributor
Executive director, Find Your Missing Child",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/introducing-your-children-to-social-media_us_5b9d0c0ce4b03a1dcc840600,"""I gave my kids access to email at relatively young ages. I wanted them to learn while they still listened to me.""",2013-04-15,A general view of social networking apps on an iPhone.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d0c0c2100003000c55ca3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Chuck Tanowitz, a principal in the public relations agency Fresh Ground, is one of the brightest social media people I know, hands down. Chuck is also the father of three young kids and has a progressive strategy for weaving social media into his family's life.Tony Loftis: What are some of the key things that you can tell parents of teenagers who probably want to pay more attention what their child is doing online and understand more about social media? Chuck Tanowitz: At this point, I'm hoping that a lot of parents aren't just getting started. I have a 14-year-old son. I'm friends with him on Facebook. I watch everything that he posts on Facebook, and I give him feedback on it over dinner. You know, ""I don't why you put this up."" Or ""I'm curious what you thought about this."" ""Do you like this?"" So, I'm having conversations with him. He is not a communicative guy, but I am trying to keep tabs on what he's doing.I'm also a firm believer in teaching your kids very young about how to use various technology tools. This is a little controversial, but I gave my kids access to email at relatively young ages. I wanted them to learn while they still listened to me. Once your kids are teenagers, they're apt to not want to listen to you. That is a very basic truth of parenting. But, when they're 6, 7, 8 years old, they're very willing to listen to you and they're very willing to listen to your advice and follow your direction and you can set up some good habits that way. TL: Can you give me an example?Chuck Tanowitz: We used email so my daughter could easily communicate with her grandparents. We monitor what they do online, so when we see activities that we don't like, we can nip those in the bud early before they become habits. That's the hope and goal. You know, we're still in unchartered territory. I tell them, ""I have access to your email. I am going to read it. You know that I'm going to read it."" These are things that my kids know and they don't balk at. They don't push against it, because it's simply ingrained from moment one.TL: More and more people are getting kids to start using appropriate social media tools at younger ages precisely for the reason that you said. As soon as you set up the expectation that you're going to monitor what they do, they're not surprised when they're 14 and 15 and you're paying close attention to what they're doing on Facebook as opposed to starting at 13-years-old and saying, ""Well, I'm going to monitor everything you do online,"" when you haven't done so to date. Chuck Tanowitz: Well, actually you know one of the ways that I interact with my young kids is with electronic tools and while my wife balks at it, I'm finding it surprisingly effective, I play the same video games that they do if I can.I play Portal, and I'm asking the kids' advice on playing Portal, and they love that I was playing Portal, and they talk with me about it.TL: How do kids look at or use social media differently than we do?Chuck Tanowitz: I had a call yesterday with a person who works with one of our partners, and I used Google Hangout to do that call. And he's never tried Google Hangout before. I said, you know, ""My daughter and her friends do Google Hangout all the time, and she'll have nine people lined up and they're all having a conversation."" My son uses Skype and Minecraft at the same time and is constantly communicating in ways that blow us away, but are so natural for him and his friends. To them, it's just another conversation. That's something that kids are comfortable with and parents aren't. You have to be aware of that that the conversations you hear around you in the house, verbal or written, are happening constantly, and it's not a question of when they turn the computer on and when they turn the computer off. It's simply a constant conversation that's going on as far as they're concerned."
