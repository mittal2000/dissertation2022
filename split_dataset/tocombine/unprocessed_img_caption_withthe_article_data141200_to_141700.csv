Those signs include persistent and severe headache, worsening back pain and unexplained fever, the hospital said.People who suffered illness in the outbreak that was first detected in Nashville in September 2012 were jolted by the phone calls from the hospital, said Nashville attorney Mark Chalos, who represents 10 families, including some whose relatives died.""It's a very scary situation and my clients are very worried about their health,"" Chalos told Reuters. ""They have struggled for more than a year with a severe illness and it looks like there's no end in sight to their suffering.""Tennessee was the second hardest-hit state, behind Michigan, in the 2012 outbreak, which killed dozens of people and made 750 people ill nationwide, according to the Centers for Disease Control. The outbreak was linked to the New England Compounding Center in Massachusetts and injections of a fungus-tainted steroid typically used to ease back pain.Some 2,000 vials of the drug went to Nashville's St. Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center, which received more than any other facility in the nation.The CDC could not be reached for additional information about the recurrences of infection because of the U.S. federal government shutdown. Calls to CDC phones were answered by recordings about furloughed workers.The outbreak of fungal meningitis was first detected at Nashville's Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where a doctor traced a dying patient's unusual symptoms to an epidural steroid injection at St. Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center.The outbreak raised awareness about potential problems at compounding pharmacies and the U.S. House of Representatives last month passed legislation that would give the Food and Drug Administration more authority to regulate companies that compound sterile drugs and ship them across state lines.The Drug Quality and Security Act, which now goes to the Senate for a vote, would create national standards to track pharmaceuticals through the distribution chain to bar fake medication."

(Photo by Scott Roth/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb43b1e1f00002501240564.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Kaskade is America's Best DJ, a point his Atmosphere tour sets out to underscore by pushing past the usual cavalcade of lasers and fireworks that big room DJs have been touring the world with for the past few years. In a set that lasted over two hours at Brooklyn's Barclays Center on Saturday night, he succeeded. The night was characterized by a tension between the old-school, underground vibes that have inspired Kaskade throughout his lengthy career in dance music and the more progressive, pop-ish elements that perform best in rooms as big as Barclays. That give and take, between darker, more consistent breaks and harder, more emphatic breakdowns, works because it's all tied together by his canon's insistence on ethereal, high-pitched female vocalists. (An insistence, it's worth noting, that can be a bit fatiguing at times.)While his classic tracks have already taken their place as legendary club music, Kaskade's more recent music demonstrates an even stronger songwriting capability, in the pop sense. ""Atmosphere,"" his recently released studio album, displays a range that's uncommon among the larger acts in dance music (save for Avicii, whose ""True"" album blends folk and country influences with progressive house). The lead and titular single off the album features Kaskade's own vocals -- a first in his career. The 42-year-old born Ryan Raddon fearlessly sang the track at Barclays, the first of a number of live performances that included Lights (""No One Knows Who We Are,"" also off of ""Atmosphere"") and Skylar Grey (""Room for Happiness""). It was a nice touch.Raddon also upped the ante on production, with moving LCD screens that hovered over the floor section of the audience. The DJ pulled a Beyonce of sorts, disappearing in a cloud of fog to reappear and perform from the other side of the arena (unlike Beyonce, however, he didn't fly back to the main stage, but leaving for improvement is always healthy). Show highlights certainly included the producer's remix of Lana Del Rey's ""Young and Beautiful,"" which is a heavy favorite for a Grammy in the Best Remixed Recording, Non-Classical category. At one point, a man in a wheelchair was seen crowd-surfing, and no pie was thrown in his face. Intense security measures caused some delays of entry into the venue, but in the wake of press reports linking electronic dance music itself to deaths at festivals and concerts, it's understandable that ever player involved in a concert of such scale (the venue, the city, talent) would be OK with increased searches and pat-downs. Kaskade himself has asked fans to forego illicit substance use in favor of letting him ""do the work,"" and on Saturday, he proved that he wasn't making an empty offer. "

Shark shepherd Jim Abernathy has spent an incredible 35 years interacting with sharks underwater and BONDED with some of the largest and most fearsome predators ion the seas. The 52-year-old, from Florida, has won the trust of many individual sharks - so much so that they follow him around like meek puppy dogs. He loves the animals so much - spending 320 days a year with them for two decades - that he has even shunned the idea of finding true love with a GIRLFRIEND or WIFE. Using his incredible relationship with sharks he has managed to capture extraordinary close up pictures of the wild predatory fish in their natural habitats in the Bahamas, Mexico and South Africa. During his career he has dived with schools of up to 20 tiger sharks - a species known as one of few man eaters - 24 basking sharks, 70 lemon sharks and a massive 350 Caribbean reef sharks. Other images show him up-close-and-personal with 15foot tiger shark Emma.

The company announced this week that it will give 30% off its Shark Shield Surf 7 device to the first 300 surfers willing to get back in the shark-infested waters of Reunion Island.Reunion Island, near Madagascar, banned swimming, body boarding and surfing this summer after suffering 10 shark attacks in two years, three of which were fatal, including the death of a 15-year-old girl and a famous local surfer. The ban was lifted Oct. 1, and by encouraging surfers to get back in the water using its product, Shark Shield is employing a high-stakes publicity strategy that could either pay off swimmingly or backfire bloodily. The Shark Shield uses two wave-emitting electrodes that create a protective field around a swimmer, diver or surfer. Sharks have gel-filled sacs called Ampullae of Lorenzini, which they use to sense electrical fields given off by possible prey. When a shark senses the electric wave caused by the Shark Shield, the intense discomfort causes the shark to swim away. The product comes in three versions, one that attaches to a diver or fisherman’s ankle, another that mounts on a board, and a third specifically designed for military or technical divers. The company claims that in a 2012 study in South Africa, a seal decoy hanging off a boat caused 16 great white shark breaches. After scientists turned on a Shark Shield, the decoy was used again and no sharks breached. Watch video of a diver using the Shark Shield to deter various sharks, including a Great White. Along with the swimming and surfing ban, Reunion Island simultaneously implemented a widely-criticized shark culling program, planning to kill 90 sharks in an effort to curb attacks.Shark Shield sees its product not only as a lifesaver for humans but also for sharks. If the shield can prevent attacks, culling programs will no longer be perceived as a necessary solution to shark attack crises.The “Surf Any Break Without Intimidation” promotion is only available for the month of October. Surfers can buy the Shark Shield Surf 7 at a discounted rate of $399 on the Shark Shield website by using the promotional code “SURF-REUNION.”"
