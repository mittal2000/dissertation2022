""If you look at the history of theater in New York, designs in the early part of the 20th century were all by well-known architects, like Thomas Lamb and the Eidlitz brothers,"" says Laurie Beckelman, president of Beckelman + Capalino, a New York-based arts consulting firm, and former chair of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. ""More recently, Eero Saarinen, who did the TWA terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport, also designed the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center. It's not a new phenomenon.""Many winners of the Pritzker Prize -- the most prestigious award in architecture -- have designed a number of these new theaters, receiving accolades for their work. Theaters by prize winners include Jean Nouvel's Guthrie Theater complex in Minneapolis (his first completed project in North America) and Frank Gehry and Hugh Hardy's Pershing Square Signature Center, the new home of the Signature Theatre Company on West 42nd Street in Manhattan. The Shanghai Poly Theater, by Tadao Ando, is now under construction in Jiading, China, next to a man-made lake in the center of a large park.These architects ""think as artists,"" says Beckelman. For example, Gehry--who also designed the Richard B. Fisher Center for the Performing Arts at Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York--is also a sculptor, and therefore ""he has an incredible range, a lifetime of experiences and a passion for all types of arts,"" she says.Cathleen McGuigan, Editor-in-Chief of Architectural Record, the oldest professional magazine for architects in the United States, describes well-known architects commissioned to design theaters as ""architects of drama, and these are spaces for drama."" That includes the work of Safdie and Gehry. ""[Their work is] very much about the flow of people moving in space,"" she says, adding, ""What's the interesting challenge about theater is they have to have space where an enormous number of people converge and circulate to their seats. These are architects who think about how people move and enter a theater, and they do so in a dramatic and elegant way.""--Jane Levere"

But, as it turns out, it's at least good for somebody's business.News of nude photos of Prince Harry, taken in Las Vegas, hit the Internet with the force of a category 5 hurricane this week. And, while the fallout might be hitting the ""wild Windsor"" -- he might face military reprimand and the royals are clearly displeased -- Las Vegas is #winning, as interest in tourism to Sin City is spiking. According to the Daily Mail, booking engine Hotels.com has seen ""a 123 percent increase in the number of searches carried out for Las Vegas compared to the equivalent day in 2011."" Virgin Holidays is reporting that Las Vegas inquiries have risen 30 percent, and will be offering a special 10 percent discount this coming weekend to further encourage trips. “Las Vegas is excited that Prince Harry continues to visit the destination for his stateside getaways,” said Jeremy Handel, spokesperson for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority, in an e-mail to The Huffington Post. “Las Vegas is about adult freedom and that means different things to different people. It’s important for friends to know what activities can be shared publicly and what activities are protected by the code of ‘What Happens in Vegas; Stays in Vegas.’” Steve Wynn, owner of the Encore Wynn resort where Prince Harry stayed in Vegas, waived his more than $47,500 bill, the Daily Mail reports. Not everyone thinks, though, this will be a shining moment for Vegas tourism.

2,DIVORCE,A Starter Marriage,"Lois Tarter, Contributor
Author, divorce blogger and divorce party planner",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-starter-marriage_us_5b9c2369e4b03a1dcc7c9097,"When I look back on my starter marriage, I realize how important it was; it helped shape me into the better wife that I am today in my second marriage.",2012-08-22,Young sad woman (mother) sitting in children room looking on photo frame (lost of child concept),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c23692400003000948fc3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A ""starter marriage"" is often defined as one that ends in divorce before age 30 with no children and little joint property. While the term starter marriage has become a mainstay in popular culture, I feel there really is no precise definition for it. It means different things to different people. For example, my starter marriage lasted 25 years. Many people get stuck in a first marriage longer than they should be. But with kids and life moving quickly, they suddenly find themselves many years down the road before they make the move to end it. People usually look at divorce as a failure. When I look back on my starter marriage, I realize how important it was; it helped shape me into the better wife that I am today in my second marriage. On the flipside, some starter marriages only last a year or less. In Hollywood, people tend to have numerous starter marriages. And some people are really lucky, and their starter marriage turns out to be their only marriage because they found the right person. Many of us aren't lucky enough to be in that situation and didn't get it right the first time. While the point of marriage is not to get divorced, it's much better to look at the positives than dwell on the negatives. If you are ending your first marriage, below are some positive benefits you may have received from your starter marriage:The ability to compromise. One thing we learn in a marriage -- whether it's good or bad -- is how to compromise. Look at your starter marriage as a class in compromising and take what you have learned and apply it to your next relationship. Knowledge about choosing sides. A marriage is all about the choices and decisions we make. One very important choice is deciding which side of the bed you want to sleep on. The good thing about a starter marriage is that you figured out the side you like. I guess there are some things you may not compromise on. The opportunity to start anew. After a starter marriage, you have a fresh start in your next relationship. There's nothing like having a clean slate and being able to move on after a stressful experience. Starting anew is the cornerstone of a healthy break-up.   Knowledge about what you want. You can't figure out what kind of wine you like without trying some. A positive thing about the starter marriage is that you have a better understanding of what you want next time out of a partner and a marriage. A list of your deal breakers. When you live with a spouse, you not only find out what you want in your partner, but you also find out what you don't want. The little things that annoy you can become big things rather quickly. So recognize what the deal breakers are, embrace them and find someone who doesn't have them. Incentive to take nothing for granted. We have all been guilty at some point of taking our significant other for granted. You need to walk away from the first marriage with an incentive to not do that the second time around. This will benefit your next marriage because both spouses like to feel appreciated. An understanding to take your time. Maybe the most beneficial thing you learned from your starter marriage is to take your time the next time around. There's no need to rush into another marriage. You been down that aisle already, so take it slow when you meet someone new. Get to know each other really well and wait for it to feel right because if it's meant to be, it will happen."

(AP Photo/Paul Sakuma)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c2c6b26000035007f6179.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Alistair BarrSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - EBay Inc's PayPal online payments service has gained access to millions of stores across the United States through an agreement with Discover Financial Services, extending its reach beyond the Web and into the physical world.Under the deal unveiled on Wednesday, PayPal will issue payment cards to its more than 50 million active users in the United States next year, which they can use to buy from merchants that already use Discover Network, which links more than 7 million U.S. retail locations.Their tie-up is the latest alliance among technology and financial corporations intended to stake out a spot in new forms of retail payment - such as ""digital wallets"" proposed by the likes of Google Inc that employ smartphones.PayPal - which accounts for almost half of eBay's annual revenue - is expanding beyond its popular Internet payments service in search of new opportunities. In the past year, it has persuaded more than 15 retailers, including Home Depot Inc and Office Depot Inc, to accept PayPal payments in their stores.For Discover - the fourth-largest U.S. credit card issuer after Visa Inc, MasterCard Inc and American Express Co - PayPal's large user base could generate significant transaction volume for its payments network.Shares of eBay were up 2.7 percent at $47.08 at midday on Wednesday, after touching a multiyear high of $48.08 earlier in the session. Discover shares were up 4.2 percent at $38.57.""This initiative further distances PayPal's digital wallet ahead of other mobile payment platforms,"" R.W. Baird Equity Research analyst Colin Sebastian wrote on Wednesday. ""PayPal continues to take measured and deliberate steps to extend its reach into the 'bricks and mortar' channel.""PayPal users will be able to pay at merchants on the Discover Network by swiping their new cards through existing check-out machines and entering a four-digit PIN.Merchants will not need to buy new hardware or software to accept PayPal, according to Don Kingsborough, the PayPal executive leading the company's offline push.""It's a big step for both companies,"" said Ken Paterson, a director at Mercator Advisory Group, a research firm that focuses on the consumer payments industry. ""This would provide a ready-made route for PayPal to get into most card-accepting retail establishments in the U.S.""CLOSING THE 'ACCEPTANCE GAP'The new cards will have a Discover Issuer Identification Number, or IIN, a code that identifies the card holder. Discover has already set up the IINs for the PayPal cards on its network, the company noted.PayPal will charge retailers a ""small"" fee when users pay with the new cards, and in turn will pay Discover for access to its network, on a per-transaction basis, the companies said. They declined to give details of these fees.Discover processed some $46.7 billion in transactions in its payment services segment during the first quarter.""We are going to process a significant amount of volume over time with PayPal,"" said Diane Offereins, president of Discover Payment Services.Teaming up with PayPal also makes Discover Network more appealing to merchants, she said. Its payment service is not used by as many merchants as Visa's or MasterCard's. Offereins estimated about 95 percent merchant coverage compared with other payment networks.""We've been working on closing the acceptance gap,"" she said. ""This will help us close that last lingering gap.""If the agreement goes well, PayPal and Discover said they may expand it outside the United States.Kingsborough said that PayPal probably will not be striking similar deals with Visa and MasterCard.""This agreement would be very difficult to duplicate,"" Kingsborough said. ""Other players in the issuer network realm have a different view of the world and want to do these things on their own.""(Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Matthew Lewis)"

6,PARENTING,The Key to Raising Confident Kids? Stop Complimenting Them!,"Dr. Peggy Drexler, Contributor
Author, research psychologist and gender scholar",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/-the-key-to-raising-confi_us_5b9c2bf5e4b03a1dcc7cd605,"The point isn't to criticize children. But it's to recognize that self-esteem really, truly comes as the result of achievement -- in the classroom, on the field, at home -- rather than false accomplishments.",2012-08-22,"Happy family women - grandmother, mother and baby make funny face",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c2bf53c00004c0009a934.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"First thing's first: I'm not saying that we shouldn't be supportive or encouraging, or help kids feel loved. But how often do we find ourselves saying ""great job!"" to the 4-year-old who cleans up her crayons after a coloring session? Or to the 8-year-old who finishes his broccoli? By dishing out praise to a child for doing things she should be doing anyway, we teach her that she gets rewarded just for being. Later, we tell them they're smart and beautiful and awesome baseball players before they've had a chance to earn it -- or know what those words really mean. They grow up placing their self-worth in that praise: If I'm not told I'm beautiful, she'll start to think, then I must not be.Research with children and families has indeed told us that praise has the opposite intended effect. It does not make children work harder, or do better. In fact, kids who are told they're bright and talented are easily discouraged when something is ""too difficult;"" those who are not praised in such a manner are more motivated to work harder and take on greater challenges. The unpraised, in turn, show higher levels of confidence, while overpraised are more likely to lie to make their performances sound better. Praise becomes like a drug: once they get it, they need it, want it, are unable to function without it.Let's look at 6-year-old Matthew. A natural athlete, Matthew was widely praised at an early age for his throwing and catching abilities. Once he became old enough to play with other children, he realized, for the first time, that he was good -- but perhaps not the best. What happened then? In Little League games, he'd choke up, constantly looking back to his parents for encouragement and forgetting to keep his eye on the ball. He'd get upset if his every effort wasn't met with accolades from his coach -- but such accolades wouldn't help him perform any better. Safe in the envelope of constant praise that happened in his backyard with his dad, Matthew was a bundle of nerves out in the real world.Here's where we also see how praising kids sets them up for a world that's almost never as generous. For kids who've spent their lives being celebrated for, say, tying their own shoes, failure can be devastating. In a recent New York magazine article, 27-year-old Lael Goodman said, ""The worst thing is that I've always gotten self-worth from performance, especially good grades. But now that I can't get a job, I feel worthless."" And this guy's an adult; it's even worse for an actual child. What's more, by focusing too much on how we can build our kids' self-esteem and confidence, we're overlooking teaching them what real achievement means -- and depriving them of knowing what it's like to feel the satisfaction of setting a high goal, working hard, and achieving it. When we place more emphasis on the reward than the process of learning or doing -- whether it's an algebra problem or hitting a fly ball -- kids inevitably focus more on the reward. They stop learning how to spell because it's a benchmark for learning (and necessary); they learn it for the trophy and ice cream party that follows.The point isn't to criticize children. But it's to recognize that self-esteem really, truly comes as the result of achievement -- in the classroom, on the field, at home -- rather than false accomplishments. Instead of praising your child with ""you're so smart!"" be specific. Tell him, ""You did a great job on your spelling quiz,"" or simply, ""You tied your own shoes!"" Instead of telling him he's he best on the team when you really don't mean it, tell him you could tell he tried hard. Next time, he'll try even harder -- guaranteed.
