Band Aid 30 is a charity project set by Bob Geldof and Midge Ure to raise money to combat the ebola epidemic in West Africa. (Photo by Danny E.

In fact, Nigeria was able to stem the Ebola crisis without much external help.“Seeking help for some of the bigger challenges in Africa has often sparked off all types of stereotypes,” said Dr. Daniel Gobgab, the head of the Christian Health Association of Nigeria. “This tends to overshadow the good that happen here.”Not everyone agreed with the critique. The Rev. Kwabena Opuni-Frimpong, general secretary of the Christian Council of Ghana, said the continent still needs people who can help mobilize resources to help fight Ebola and the willingness to help is appreciated.“They do that not because Africans are a bunch of helpless, hopeless people, but to remind the world of our common humanity and our common responsibility,” said Opuni-Frimpong.In Sierra Leone, one of the countries bearing the brunt of the crisis, Ebun James–Dekam, general secretary of the Council of Churches, said Band Aid was raising funds for people who are suffering.“I bet when the monies are sent to us we will not say we do not want it,” she said.She blames some problems facing the continent on Africa itself.West Africa’s most famous musicians recently released their own Ebola appeal song, which urges the people to trust doctors."

2,EDUCATION,What Can Mentoring Organizations Learn From Each Other? What Data Is Missing?,"Tara Chklovski, ContributorFounder and CEO, Iridescent",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/post_8727_b_6298422.html,"We were just able to pull high level metrics such as increased interest in STEM, overall reach, contact hours etc. They are a step forward, but there is so much more data that we can gather to draw a more nuanced picture that will be helpful for the field.",2014-12-11,2014-12-10-TheMentoringEffect_Infographic_Final.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-10-TheMentoringEffect_Infographic_Final-thumb.jpg,"In our last article we focused on how mentoring enables personalized and deep learning (by employing a ""Cognitive Apprenticeship"" framework).For this article, we will share insights gathered from high-performing mentoring organizations and from the research conducted by MENTOR: The National Mentoring Partnership. Mentoring has a profound, life-changing impact on youth, especially at-risk youth as seen in the infographic from MENTOR's report called The Mentoring Effect, below.We talked to each of the following organizations and tried to identify patterns. Each organization caters to a different target age (as seen below) and has a different approach (as we outlined in the previous article). Each is making a profound impact on the students it serves. Some of the challenges we encountered when trying to compare such unique organizations were as follows:Lack of time: Some organizations were not able to provide cumulative data at short notice. For instance, TechBridge is a powerful program making real change in thousands of girls. Just this year they reached more than 14,000 girls, but they needed more time to pull cumulative impact data across all years.Lack of deep data: We were just able to pull high level metrics such as increased interest in STEM, overall reach, contact hours etc. They are a step forward, but there is so much more data that we can gather to draw a more nuanced picture that will be helpful for the field.The graphs below try to plot whatever data we were able to get and identify useful patterns.   Seeing these graphs, Mike Garringer, Director of Knowledge Management at Mentor suggested that perhaps age of operation is not the best measure of sustainability in this branch of the field, seeing that several of these programs needed the technology to be in place for their service delivery to go from idea to reality. We Teach Science is a great example of that where its Skype-like platform couldn't have existed in a scalable way 10 years ago. We also recognize that sheer number of contact hours has very little connection to depth of impact. It is more about the quality.For our next article, we would love to do another round of data collection and analysis with these organizations and others that we may have unintentionally missed. Some of the variables we would like to collect are:* data on the closeness of the mentor-mentee relationship, whether it is the primary focus of the learning experience, or the icing. We would like to connect this data to the depth of student learning gains. * mentor retention - what aspects of the relationship inspire mentors and encourage them to come back year after year * how much support is needed from the organization to make a good match between the mentor and mentee.We would also love to hear any thoughts or suggestions you may have on what data points we should collect and look at.The need is large, the field is small. There is much to be learned and improved.moveForward(100);(Graphic created by Audra Torres, Iridescent. Data gathered through interviews with senior leadership at organizations whenever possible.

3,BLACK VOICES,Demands for Justice Are Failing Black Women and Girls,"Kali Nicole Gross, ContributorProfessor of African American Studies at Wesleyan University",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/demands-for-justice-are-failing-black-women-and-girls_b_6295744.html,Many of the condemnations of police brutality have excluded the experiences of black women who have been brutalized in custody. The ongoing media blackout surrounding the case of 13 black women allegedly assaulted by a police officer in Oklahoma City may be the hardest evidence of the devaluation of African-American women's lives.,2014-12-11,"Marissa Alexander enters the courtroom for a hearing on Tuesday, June 10, 2014 in Jacksonville, Fla. Circuit Judge James Daniel set a hearing for August 1 on whether Alexander should be granted a second stand your ground self-defense hearing. Daniel also set a new tentative date of Dec. 1 for Alexanderâs second trial on aggravated assault with a deadly weapon charges. Alexander, 33, was convicted in May 2012 of three counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and was sentenced to 20 years in prison under the stateâs minimum mandatory requirements. Alexander says she acted in self-defense after her estranged husband beat her. The warning shots were fired near her husband and his two children. (AP Photo/The Florida Times-Union, Bob Mack, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae02622400005000964f9e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When pundits and black leaders bemoaned the irony of a St. Louis County grand jury announcing its decision not to indict Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson for killing 18-year-old Michael Brown Jr. on the same day that slain civil-rights activists James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner were posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, few noted another cruel irony. Just as Wilson walked free of charges despite having shot and killed an unarmed black teenager, Marissa Alexander, the battered black woman initially sentenced to 20 years in prison in Florida for firing an alleged warning shot into the ceiling of her home as her abusive ex-husband allegedly threatened her despite a restraining order against him, headed back to jail to serve an additional 65 days on top of the three years she has already served. Alexander accepted a plea deal in the face of new charges filed against her, charges that would have amounted to 60 years in prison had she been convicted.Also absent from the pleas for justice are the names of too many other African Americans cut down like Brown, people such as Rekia Boyd, Aiyana Stanley-Jones, Yvette Smith and, most recently, Tanisha Anderson.A few weeks ago Anderson's family called 911 for an ambulance to obtain medical and mental-health assistance for the 37-year-old woman. Instead of help, Cleveland police officers arrived and put her in handcuffs, and her family says they ultimately slammed her on the pavement outside the home. She died shortly thereafter.In October a mistrial was declared in the case against the Detroit police officer who fatally shot Aiyana Stanley-Jones, 7, during a botched police raid on her home in 2010. Wayne County jurors deadlocked over whether Joseph Weekley should be convicted on the charge of ""careless discharge of a firearm causing death."" Roland Lawrence, the chairman of the Justice for Aiyana Committee, pondered aloud, ""Surely, the death of a baby by a well-trained police force must be deemed unacceptable in a civilized society."" But black girls, even those asleep in their beds, do not have the luxury of childhood in America.These are not the only oversights.Many of the condemnations of police brutality have excluded the experiences of black women who have been brutalized in custody. The ongoing media blackout surrounding the case of 13 black women allegedly assaulted by a police officer in Oklahoma City may be the hardest evidence of the devaluation of African-American women's lives. The women have testified that they were subjected to rape, forcible sodomy and sexual battery. These are among the 36 felony charges leveled against Daniel Holtzclaw. Part of the evidence against him includes DNA from the youngest alleged victim, a 17-year-old girl. It was found inside the officer's uniform trousers. Yet he remains out on bail, and the alleged victims remain forgotten in the black community's rage against racist policing and a broken justice system.As the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown reignite the movement for real change in the U.S. criminal-justice system, black women's experience of state-sanctioned anti-black violence must be included. That means demanding that the U.S. Department of Justice investigate the Oklahoma judge who granted and reduced bail in the Holtzclaw case, in addition to demanding that the DOJ bring charges against Darren Wilson and the Ferguson Police Department. It also means rewriting the laws so that it isn't nearly impossible to indict police officers who kill unarmed civilians, and rewriting laws that allow battered women to serve decades in prison for attempting to defend themselves. Florida Gov. Rick Scott should pardon Marissa Alexander, and she should be freed immediately.More broadly, we need a complete overhaul of the justice system -- everything from the nationwide implementation of cop body cams to the implementation of equitable sentencing, beginning with how black and white suspects are investigated and charged.We need better accountability and oversight of the ways that prosecutors adjudicate cases involving African Americans, who we know are disproportionately targeted by police as a group. One of the most egregious examples is that despite parity in black and white drug use, African Americans are arrested on drug charges at far higher rates. Here again, we cannot fail to stress that this has directly and disproportionately affected black women too.This blossoming movement must also consider the relationship between police brutality and police abdication -- namely, failure by police to protect and value black lives. Doing so would have profound implications for black women because it would draw attention not only to police violence against black women but to the ways that the failure by police to protect black women has mortal consequences. One wonders how differently things might have gone for Marissa Alexander if she had been able to rely on police when her abusive ex-husband came back around despite the restraining order against him. Given the fate of black folks like Tanisha Anderson and Eric Garner, it's painfully clear why she had to fire that warning shot instead."
4,HEALTHY LIVING,5 Simple Tricks To Make You A Better Runner,Kate Bratskeir,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/run-faster-good-trick_n_6117944.html,,2014-12-10,"A female trail running in the Red Rock reserve outside Las Vegas, Nevada.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d2c613280000db2c6fd230.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Running is a mental sport. At times, negative thoughts can get in the way of a potentially great day on the trails and make it a mediocre one. You think, ""I'm never going to get faster,"" ""I'm a horrible runner"" or ""I'm way too tired for this,"" and suddenly every second placing one foot in front of the other becomes excruciating.It happens to all of us. But there are some mental magic tricks that can help you take control of your thoughts, and manipulate them to actually improve your running. Yep, with your brain alone, you can become a better, faster, stronger runner. And best of all, you've got all the resources right inside your head -- no new equipment required. Try a few of these quirky strategies below and prepare to experience your best run yet.Photo credit: JGI/Tom Grill via Getty Images1. Focus on the finish line. A new study from New York University showed that a little thought-tweaking can help athletes get to their destination more quickly. In the study, when walkers focused on the finish line instead of thinking about their surroundings, they were faster and perceived their distance as shorter. This mental trick is not just reserved for one sport; the study's authors speculate the strategy could work for any activity -- like biking, for example -- where you can focus on a marker in front of you. You don't need to reach the final finish to milk this approach for all its worth. Focus on mini-targets for the duration of your workout -- like a trash can or tree branch -- to break your sweat session into segments. It'll feel a lot more manageable. 2. Recruit some fans.  A study published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience found that looking at positive visuals, like encouraging words and happy faces, helped exercisers workout for longer and feel like they were using less energy. Beyond providing moral support, the dedicated fans who hold up signs and cheer for their race-running pals may actually be helping them get to the finish line. 3. Talk to yourself. You might look a little crazy, but it won't matter because you'll keep your pace while other, silent runners will be fatigued. According to Runner's World, a good mantra is one that's ""short, positive, instructive, and full of action words."" The repetition of strong, uplifting words could be the boost you need to stay afloat mentally; after all, any runner knows that getting down on yourself in your own head is a surefire way to have a bad run. Runner's World says that besides strong legs and lungs, you need a ""strong head"" to keep on running: ""Doubts and distractions can derail your attempts, but a well-chosen mantra can keep you calm and on target.""4. Don't confuse mental fatigue for physical fatigue. A study published in the Journal of Applied Physiology found that mental fatigue can impair physical performance. Two groups completed a high-intensity cycling exercise, and the group that engaged in a mentally-draining activity beforehand performed worse compared to the group who had done something emotionally neutral. The mentally-drained group perceived their workout as much more difficult and quit much sooner. This experiment emphasizes the fact running is a mental battle. But, as Runner's World writes, ""it is possible to [...] fool the mind into allowing the body to work harder."" Just acknowledging that your exhaustion might be coming from your head could help you power through.5. Incentivize your run. This last trick does require a little cash, but if you do it right, you could be increasing your bank account balance and your weekly mileage. While money can't buy happiness, it might be able to motivate you to keep on trekking. A 2013 Mayo Clinic study found that people were more likely to stick with their weight loss program if they had financial incentives. These people also lost more weight than those who went unpaid. An earlier study published in Econometrica found that people who were paid $100 to go to the gym doubled their attendance rate. Apps like Pact has users commit to a healthier lifestyle (through diet and/or exercise). When users goals are met, they are rewarded with cold, hard cash. When a user fails to complete his or her goal -- say, running 30 miles a week -- the user is charged.Also on HuffPost:"
5,STYLE,Pump Up Your Style: Fashion By Bravo,"Shira Hirschman Weiss, ContributorWriter, Blogger, Regular contributor to local newpapers in Ber...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pump-up-your-style-fashio_b_6207288.html,"I am a fashion lover and as I discussed with Bravo TV's Stassi Schroeder of Vanderpump Rules, I am intent on keeping to a limited budget.",2014-12-10,2014-12-09-PhotowithspecialpermissionofMicheleBlashkaLeHoarderBlog.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-12-09-PhotowithspecialpermissionofMicheleBlashkaLeHoarderBlog-thumb.JPG," (The fashionable cast of Vanderpump Rules, Image provided by Bravo TV) I am a fashion lover and as I discussed with Bravo TV's Stassi Schroeder of Vanderpump Rules, I am intent on keeping to a limited budget. The ongoing question is how to do this without breaking the bank. I will be the first to admit that I am among countless Americans who have shunned their credit cards and are taking painstaking efforts to use only cash. So many of us are in this position, but remain closetted. Well, I for one am coming out. I have some expensive looking items, but they are either gifts, consignment store purchases or from long ago when I was a richer girl (single, living in NYC, before the ""dot com bomb"" and later, kids and the associated expenses of having a family. Up next in our lives: orthodontics). This may be a reason why I like Vanderpump Rules, which would seem like a show that I as a 40-year-old would never relate to because it chronicles the shenanigans of mainly 20-somethings. Unlike those Real Housewives, with Vanderpump, we are shown a world where people have to work as servers and may dress fashionably, but make no bones about essentially living paycheck to paycheck. (Of course, we have to wonder how they might be profiting from ""reality"" in the long run and then there are those spin-off clothing lines cast members are launching.) Stassi, who worked as a server in Lisa Vanderpump's restaurants for years, totally gets the thrifty thing. She says she receives the most compliments on the least expensive items she wears. In a phone conversation, she advises me as a busy mom to have a ""uniform"" (i.e. a white t-shirt and skinny jeans) and match it up with different accessories, such as statement necklaces, bold scarves or Stassi's favorite recommendation: a cobalt bag: (Photo courtesy of up and coming fashion blogger, the beautiful and savings-savvy Michelle Blashka aka Shoppinggal)Shoppinggal links to other great, economical finds on Le Hoarder and since she is a Vanderpump viewer herself, she has an eye out for the type of style that viewers would be interested in (and more).  I decided that it might help folks like me out to make some suggestions about spicing up one's attire despite a constraining budget. For the sheer lighthearted fun of it, I've culled together some tips based on some shows currently on Bravo and through Michelle's blog. Don't go shopping for new items if you can pull together what is currently in your closet. (Note to Stassi, check out Shoppinggal!)It's All About the Basic: Now that you see her, you know there is actually nothing basic or ordinary about Stassi, but she is able to refresh her own look via accessories that draw the eye. She could wear the same black dress every Monday and we'd never notice the pattern.   (Courtesy of Bravo TV)...Or Is It All About the Bold?... Shoppinggal starts with one bold statement piece and works the more basic offerings around it. Apparently, blondes have more fun and it's certainly seasonally appropriate to add some red -- wait, what's that? It's actually ""bright neon orange"" -- to winter wardrobes.  (All photos with permission of Michelle Blashka, AKA Shoppinggal)No Boohoo to This Black and Blue In high school, my very confident fashion-forward friend Inga wore a lot of navy with black and I often wondered if she ""matched."" Remember that term, ""matching?"" (Admittedly, I'm being hyperbolic, but ""matchy matchy"" is not a tease-worthy term without merit). My kids tell me that matching is passe and my son recently had a friend come over who was dressed in mismatched plaid. A few years ago, black and navy and a more royal blue-like shade of navy started making appearances on runways. I tried the trend myself with a jewel necked blue dress, black cardigan and black tights that I wore to numerous events and I received many compliments on the look. Now that hint of blue that peeks out of a gray or black suit from a man's tie is a flirtatious way to approach this style. David Parnes from Million Dollar Listing LA pulls that off looking low-key cool (plus, check out the snazzy shoes that bring a bit more color to the whole ensemble):  (Bravo TV)A Crown Fit for a Princess Stassi's friends on Vanderpump Rules have referred to her in past seasons as ""Princess Stassi"" and three months ago, she posted a jeweled headpiece of her own craftsmanship on Instagram. Handbands are a great way for girls to incorporate ""jewelry,"" brighten up hair in need of highlights and also pair with glasses and a bun for the sexy librarian look. Here's a trick for hair so thick (like mine): Instead of pulling all hair back in the headband, trap enough strands underneath to make the mane appear less full looking.  (Photo given with full permission by Stassi Schroeder's publicist) The chic chignon look also works well with a headband like these from Deepa Gurnani (all beautifully handcrafted by the Indian designer): (Photo courtesy of Deepa Gurnani)Nene Leekes, another Bravolebrity, wore a thick jeweled Deepa Gurnani headband at her wedding. Nene still wears statement headbands on The Real Housewives of Atlanta, but not quite as blingy as her wedding headpiece.  (Photo Courtesy of Bravo TV)Personal confession: I own a Pottery Barn treasure chest filled with beautiful headbands and it also consists of three of the intricate Deepa Gurnani styles (I also have a Deepa Gurnani clutch bracelet). Jay Lakhani, who is the owner and designer alongside his wife Deepa Gurnani says:Each season, Deepa and I do intense trend research and zero in on a direction we will pursue. We start sourcing our raw materials from all over the world and start conceptualizing our key pieces. We travel to India every six weeks to get inspired and be extremely hands on with the embroidery process. Since every piece is hand made, we need to reinvent ourselves each season.  Leaders of the Band, Jay Lakhani and Deepa Gurnani, pictured above (photo provided by Melissa Rappaport).For Winter's ""Layered Look,"" a Better Sweater You may not know this if you watch the social scheming on Vanderpump Rules, but playboy Jax Taylor works really hard in a professional capacity. In addition to mixing drinks, he has a clothing and accessories partnership with XCalibur Shoes and reportedly, is very committed to the brand. Due to the weather in sunny California, we don't get to see as much of the layered look on some of our Bravo shows as we do on the runway, but here, Jax models his own sweater and with this link, we see it's not just for guys:   (Photo courtesy of Bravo TV)Nailing It There is a lot that I can say about this picture. For instance, Lisa Edelstein (who I love!) wears a lot of white, not unlike Kerry Washington on Scandal, and white is the new black in terms of new discoveries on its streamlining/slimming of the appearance quality. However, I must point out Janeane Garofalo's nails. Dark hues give a certain polish to nails, so if you've saved your ""Wicked"" by Essie, you can still use it this winter. (Photo Credit: Carole Segal for Bravo)Here, Stassi does a ""matchy matchy"" of nails to jacket, which gives a together look for the whole outfit. The contrasts between light and dark shown on and off the runway this season signify that we currently have a wide range of options across the nail color spectrum: Topping It All Off  We've made quite a jump from the tips of our fingers to the top of our heads, I admit, but isn't fashion also about creative license? That said, I am a big fan of a great hat and there's no greater mad-hatter on Bravo than Cynthia Bailey of The Real Housewives of Atlanta. Fedoras made a big comeback in the past couple of years and are now being considered as ""classic."" A good one may never go out of style -- although I wouldn't compare it to a white button down shirt. (Of course, the fact that Cynthia is a gorgeous model helps her pull it off!)

For all intents-and-purposes he ceased to exist after 1940 when they gave him pupils and cut off his tail. As Kenneth Anger eloquently put it: ""they castrated the poor fellow."" Some other old stuff I like: Marcel Proust, Walker Evans, Hoagy Carmichael, oscillators, Bringing up Baby, Robert Frank, Robert Crumb, hand-drawn maps, Lenny Bruce, Campari, The Night of the Hunter, Wally Berman, steak-au-poivre, Krazy Kat, Anna Karenina, Exile on Main St.-era Rolling Stones, the former Yugoslavia, George Plimpton, Georges Perec, the twist, The Marx Bros., Paris in the 20's, New York in the 70's (the late 70's), Prince.Who are your favorite theorists and what is it about them that you admire?Roland Barthes, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Richard Feynman, Susan Sontag, Brian Eno, W.G. Sebald, Geoff Dyer, Tom McCarthy. I like them for their elasticity of thought. I used to be really into Heidegger but he turned out to be an asshole.Do you think semiotics is relevant in this day and age?Yes -- the more we immerse ourselves in a virtual representation of reality, the more important signifiers become.Vice is such a rapidly expanding media outlet, what do you foresee the company doing next?Becoming ubiquitous."

Despite our progress as a nation and more broadly as a human race, we still struggle with seemingly antiquated modes of thinking that lead to unnecessary frictions between people. It is as if the impressive advances in social psychology and neuroscience have not sunk into the consciousness of the broader population.We now have a much deeper understanding of the countless fallacies of thought, biases, and group dynamics to which all humans are prone. We now understand that socioeconomic status, culture, education, language, environment, personal experience, and differential treatment are among the most important causal factors behind the varying behavioral outcomes of different social groups. Our differences have absolutely nothing to do with skin color. Sensible people always understood this, but science has now proven it.So why we do we continue to behave as if different gradations of pigment and varying facial structures matter? Why do we still look at each other as if we are anything other than fellow humans? Sadly, it is because race does still matter. It is those very fallacies of thought, biases, and group dynamics that, when combined with differential treatment and social power, create meaningful divisions within human society out of otherwise meaningless differences.It is human nature to notice differences in skin tone and react to them. Studies of how young children react to race provide evidence of this. But the way in which we react is not foreordained. Different people may naturally react with curiosity, pity, fear, hatred, admiration, and so on. Our new understanding of neuroplasticity makes it clear that we can train our minds. We now have concrete evidence that our brains are malleable and can be conditioned to a certain degree throughout our lives. This means we can teach ourselves and each other not to react negatively to race. On a biological level, different skin tones can tell us about our relative abilities to absorb or repel the Sun's rays. They may also tell us something about proclivity to specific diseases or ability to process certain types of food, but even these are unclear and vary on an individual level.The peril of race comes when we imbue it with greater meaning than it actually has, when we use it as a tool to categorize people and then assume certain characteristics based on those categories. Of course, we know scientifically that these categories are, quite frankly, stupid. They simply don't withstand any kind of meaningful analysis, and those who use them as a proxy for actually getting to know different people are guilty of intellectual laziness at best, and intolerance and bigotry at worst.Tragically, racial groupings in America and much of the world are still given importance -- which is often referred to as the social construction of race. When this imagined meaning is paired with intolerance and asymmetrical social power between different racial groups, it leads to all of the differences that we observe between the races. But they are not caused by race. They are caused by ignorance, hatred, and differential treatment. They are caused by marginalization and abuse of power. This is why one racial group or another may exhibit higher rates of poverty, violence, or drug abuse. In the United States, African Americans as a group still lag behind the American average in many indicators because they have suffered historical injustices, tend to be treated unfairly by police, are often viewed with a higher degree of suspicion and fear by their fellow citizens, are not afforded the same opportunities, and so on.In short, American society has been mistreating African Americans for centuries. Despite the civil-rights movement and all the advances in our scientific understanding of human behavior, we still mistreat them. Of course, they are not the only ones who are mistreated. But of any social grouping in America, they have probably suffered the greatest. And yet we still continue to treat them differently even knowing that skin color is meaningless.It has to stop. Like right now. It makes no sense. It is the product of antiquated thinking that is not only unjust, wasteful, and damaging to society but based on deeply flawed reasoning or a complete lack of reason. Continuing to think about race as a causal factor of behavior is as foolish today as it was to believe that the Sun revolved around the Earth in late 17th-century Italy. It is a now disproven mode of thought that is slowing human progress. As soon as the differential treatment of races stops, the social frictions of race will start to disappear. Of course, we all have unconscious biases and are susceptible to lazy thinking, so we have to catch ourselves. We have to practice empathy and recognize the biases and mental shortcuts that we use throughout the day that aren't based on actual facts or knowledge. Observing differences in skin tone is natural simply because our vision registers shades and colors, but believing that this tells us anything substantive about the person we are looking at is entirely in our own minds. Armed with this knowledge, we can all train ourselves to be better people. As a society, we should teach empathy and the basics of social psychology in our public schools; we should retrain our police to understand the tricks that our minds play on us; and we should foster social inclusion of all of our citizens. Doing so will help erase the scars of race that still plague America and will make us stronger in every way. It's not just a question of justice -- it's science."

Things like disease, war, our declining natural resources, and poverty. I could go on and on. These issues can cause us anxiety and uneasiness. But the fears that I believe cause us the most pain and worry are the ones that exist within us. Fears such as: Am I loved? Am I good enough?Am I a good mother, sister or friend? Am I good at my job? Am I living the life I desire to live? These are the kinds of worries and fears that I see wreaking havoc in women's lives, including my own. I find that many times these doubts live under the surface. They smolder in our being, never really being talked about or addressed, maybe even not being acknowledged. Why would we ignore them? We sweep them under the rug because they are HARD questions. These are the ones that bring up all kinds of, excuse my language, shit! To address these fears we need to dig into the past, assess the present and perhaps learn to let go of worrying about the future. This is not work for sissies! But I believe, no, I know, that it is work worth doing. What I see with women in my life, including me at times, is that they/we often find it easier to gloss over the yucky, uneasy feelings that bubble up on occasion than it is to stop and examine them and spend time trying to figure out what they mean and why they are coming up. I mastered the art of avoidance. For years, it was my way of being. That is until my heart and soul were literally screaming for me to stop and listen. What did that look like? It looked like: exhaustion, feeling resentful, sadness, physical illness and an overall feeling that my compass was WAY off. I had most of the fears I mentioned, but lets take the example of, ""Am I living the life I desire or was put on this earth to live?"" That is a BIG question. I knew instinctively that the answer was a big fat NO! But my mind could easily rationalize that I was being silly and somewhat selfish to want something different or bigger. After all, by outside appearances I had a perfect life. I had a good paying, well-respected job, a supportive husband, two amazing healthy boys as well as a loving, supportive extended family. My need to rationalize away my desires was all about fear. I knew that what my heart and soul were asking for required massive change and upheaval. This fear is what keeps so many of us stuck, unable to enact the change we know we need. Well, I hate to say it, but you knew it was coming; we have to act in the face of fear. ""Fear is not your enemy. It is a compass pointing you to the areas where you need to grow."" -- Steve PavinaI am not suggesting you need to take some massive life altering action right away. What I am suggesting is that you at least listen to your heart's desires. Figure out what it is you really want or need and take some small action step in that direction. Steven Pressfield wrote, ""Put your ass where your heart wants to be. By that I mean if you want to paint, put your body in front of an easel. If you want to write, sit in front of the keyboard."" I believe that in any area of our life where we feel stuck, there is fear, and fear causes resistance. I would encourage you to look into what your desires are, what your fears are and where you are encountering resistance. These are the areas that require your attention. This is where your work is. Once you have identified them choose one area where you can enact change and take some sort of action in the face of fear and resistance. When you finally do this, celebrate yourself and this victory! In some way, honor yourself and the step you have taken. This will help keep you on the path to transforming your life.I am excited to hear from you how you are going to act in the face of fear and resistance. I would also love to know how you plan on celebrating yourself when you do. Please let me know in the comments below.I will close with a quote from The War of Art, a book by Steven Pressfield.

I still felt very let down by NBC's latest live musical outing, this year's long-awaited revival of the 1954 classic Peter Pan, which for many adults was a TV perennial once upon a time.As a child I fell asleep watching Disney's Peter Pan on the big screen. Admittedly I generally wasn't interested if there wasn't a princess or a witch involved. My aunt told me that she thought I would enjoy the TV version better. So imagine my excitement when NBC aired it in 1989. My aunt tried to prep me by letting me know that J.R.'s (Larry Hagman from Dallas) mommy (Mary Martin) played Peter Pan. Of course that didn't faze me in the least. I liked to pretend I was Dorothy Gale, so why couldn't ""J.R.'s mommy"" pretend to be Peter Pan?! No sooner did she fly on screen did La Martin had me high on her fairy dust.Now when I first heard that Peter Pan was next on NBC's list, my mind began to race. There was a short-lived rumor that tradition might be broken and a young man might be cast in the role. My choices for Peter Pan and Hook: Daniel Radcliffe and Hugh Jackman. Both have proven they are capable musical theater performers and they have that box office draw cache that the networks are so hell bent on using to promote these specials. How could they go wrong with Harry Potter and Wolverine?! Funny enough, Jackman will be playing ""Black Beard"" in the upcoming 2015 film PAN.Alisson Williams bared the burden of slipping into the iconic flying harness of Marty Martin. Many have cried nepotism, as she is the daughter of NBC's own Brian Williams. I must say Williams has a lovely singing voice. She delivered a sweet and solid rendition of ""Never Never Land."" Also effective was Williams' rendition of ""When I Went Home"" (cut from the original Broadway show). Through such ballads, Williams showed her strength as an actress. However, Peter, as depicted in the infamous statue in Kensington Gardens, is no more than 6 years old. Unfortunately, as Peter,Williams comes off as a very responsible and proper young man, not a plucky 6-year-old. I do not blame Ms. Williams. I blame bad direction for not allowing her to be the youthful, joyful, free spirit Peter claims he is toward the end of the show. Williams simply needed more sprightliness and more cock-a in her doodle-doo.  The Peter Pan statue commissioned by Author J.M. Barrie that stands today in Kensington GardensFor me Captain Hook will always be the great Cyril Ritchard. Christopher Walken simply seemed to be ""Walken"" through his performance altogether, devoid of fun, impishness and yes, lovable-ness. Most of Hook's potential wonderful moments all came off as throwaways. Okay, his tap number was charming to watch. Beyond that his performance in Peter Pan left me saying, ""Get the hook!"" Broadway dynamo Kelli O' Hara was totally wasted as Mrs. Darling. She didn't even have the benefit of one moment to really shine as Audra McDonald did with ""Climb Every Mountain"" in The Sound of Music Live! last year. Perhaps that was a calculated move by the producers this time around, considering the fact that McDonald's solo garnered more attention and stole the evening away from the lackluster and totally miscast Carrie Underwood. I have been a fan of Christian Borle since seeing him on Broadway in Thoroughly Modern Millie. His Smee was delightful and hunky, revealing quite a bit of bicep and, like many, I also marveled at Borle's guns. A sexy Smee works for me! As Wendy, Broadway actress Taylor Louderman was superbly cast. She conveyed a lovely presence and won me over with her big solo, ""It's Only Pretend.""Yes, The Lost Boys looked more like The Lost Men but I will say this: They all conjured up that essence of rakish little tots brilliantly and they danced their asses off! In fact the ensemble as a whole should be commended and applauded for shining brighter than Tinker Bell in all of the production numbers. Those aerial shots combing over foggy London town set with twinkle lights in the distance made me feel as if I were riding Peter Pans Flight in Disney Land; having Tinker Bell as a CGI that the audience could actually see on screen was a nice touch, though not a totally new innovation, as the precocious pixie was depicted this way in the 1977 Mia Farrow version. When Mary Martin and company go soaring skyward in the 1960 telecast it still gives me goose bumps. This time around they should have changed the lyrics from ""I'm Flying"" to ""I'm Dangling."" At one point everyone looked like they feared they might plunge into the London town miniature below. Most bothersome about this production was that it became monotonous. Many of my friends with kids said their little ones lost interest halfway through. A glutton for punishment, I went back and watched the show twice more before writing this piece. Then I went back and watched Martin's version and no contest, the latter still shines like a new penny and holds you captivated in its magical spell. It maintains a key ingredient the new incarnation was sorely lacking: whimsy. There was nothing whimsical about Peter Pan Live! at all.At the helm I blame flawed direction by Rob Ashford. Let's call foul on the casting of the principals too. When will this trend of stunt casting end? When will directors be hired who understand this genre? Why not let a good show sell itself and draw the audience in? Why not cast an established Broadway star ? The possibilities are endless and would be far more entertaining. In the end, Peter Pan Live! was, in my opinion, a missed opportunity and low on fairy dust. Every time a child tuned out from its viewing a renewed hope in live TV musicals fell down dead, and no amount of clapping could save  Peter Pan Live! from not being magical."

In-N-Out placed eighth on the list, which was topped by Google and the Boston consulting firm Bain & Co. The regional burger chain, which has restaurants in California, Arizona, Nevada, Utah and Texas, is the only fast-food company on the list. It didn’t crack the top 50 last year.Glassdoor’s ranking was based entirely on employee feedback. Glassdoor collected more than 800,000 reviews from workers about the pros and cons of their jobs; how satisfied they are with their company; whether they would recommend a friend work there; and information about pay, benefits, opportunities to advance and work-life balance. Companies were ranked based on their average employee ratings on a 5-point scale, with 5 being total job satisfaction. The full ranking, which only includes companies with at least 1,000 workers, can be found below.In an industry known for low salaries and poor treatment of workers In-N-Out is often recognized for playing against type. According to Carl Van Fleet, vice president of planning and development at In-N-Out, the starting wage at the company is $10.50 an hour. That's a lot higher than the median hourly pay for fast-food workers nationwide, which is $8.94 an hour. ""We strive to create a working environment that is upbeat, enthusiastic and customer-focused,"" Van Fleet wrote in an email to The Huffington Post. ""A higher pay structure is helpful in making that happen, but it is only part of our approach. It is equally important to treat our associates well and maintain that positive working environment in all of our restaurants.""Just last week, fast food workers in 190 cities across the country protested the industry's treatment of workers. But In-N-Out workers seem to be pretty satisfied with the company. “Great pay rates, fantastic hours, calm and comfortable atmosphere, plenty of benefits, full of opportunity, friendly coworkers, overall very happy with the experience I gain here,” a part-time associate who has been working at In-N-Out for less than a year said in a review posted on Glassdoor. The jobs site moderates worker reviews and verifies users based on their email addresses or Facebook profiles. A full-time associate who has worked at the company for more than five years listed the following pros: “The values of the company, the way they treat their associates, paid holidays off, atmosphere.”One of the cons of the job, according to Glassdoor, is that it's difficult to get a full-time job there. Workers also complained about a strict dress code, standing for long hours, and that you often smell like burgers at the end of a shift. But those usually come with the fast-food territory."

They waved and cited inter-department regulation after regulation to prove that they bar the use of the hold, don't teach it to officers, and that many officers themselves say they wouldn't know how to use it anyway. That's not the end of the chokehold story. Periodic lawsuits brought by victims of the chokehold against departments at various times over the years show that some departments and officers do use the chokehold or a variant of it to subdue suspects. The U.S. Supreme Court made that possible. Nearly four decades ago it could have ended the chokehold use. It didn't. In 1976, Adolph Lyon, a young African-American motorist was stopped by the LAPD. Lyon offered no resistance but was still wrapped in a chokehold by an officer. Lyon was severely injured as a result of the hold. He promptly sued and sought a court injunction against the hold.The case appeared solid on several grounds. He could show a disparate use of the hold against African-Americans. The LAPD had used the chokehold with impunity for years, and in one span the majority of the 16 of the victims that died as a result of the chokehold were black. This appeared to fall under the purview of the constitutional provision barring cruel and unusual punishment. In sworn testimony officers made jokes and wisecracks about how some suspects placed in the chokehold danced, and squirmed uncontrollably. The officers admitted that they had no knowledge of the lethal effect of the hold and that their training officers did not bother to tell them of the life threatening danger of the hold. The case meandered through the courts for years. Meanwhile, the LAPD publicly claimed that it had temporarily suspended the use of the hold pending a high court decision. But other police departments continued to use the chokehold with no legal or departmental restraints. The death toll continued to mount. One of them was the New York police department which also had a massive number of complaints about the hold and the injuries it caused. In 1983, the court finally spoke. In a stunning majority opinion it flatly said that federal courts had no power to prohibit the use of the hold. It didn't stop there. It added that ""there was a real and immediate threat that Lyon would again be stopped... by an officer who would illegally choke him into unconsciousness."" Translated, a victim could be subject to its use again if stopped by a police officer and it posed no threat to him. This was an open license to continue to use the chokehold. In a blistering dissent, Justice Thurgood Marshall blasted the absurdity of the legal logic behind use of the chokehold: ""Since no one can show that he will be choked in the future, no one -- not even a person who, like Lyons, has almost been choked to death--has standing to challenge the continuation of the policy.""An exultant LAPD chief Daryl Gates claimed victory and said that it vindicated his contention that the chokehold was an appropriate tactic to be used. Gates then transformed himself into a medical anatomical scientist and claimed that maybe there was something in the physical make-up of blacks that was different from that of ""normal people"" that predisposed them to drop dead from the hold. Gates's over the top racist, inflammatory gibe ignited a storm of protest, and a red faced Gates slightly back pedaled on it. The same year the LAPD officially barred the use of the chokehold. The NYPD followed suit and in the next decade other departments fell in line and officially banned the use of the hold. In the three decades since the court refused to bar the use of the hold the record still is that there is nothing in law or public policy that officially precludes any police department from putting the chokehold or a variation of it back in its weapons arsenal. In fact, a decade after the LAPD officially barred the use of the hold it was back on the table again following the beating of black motorist Rodney King in 1991. The LAPD debated whether to reinstate the chokehold again on the grounds it was a less lethal way to subdue a suspect. Though it chose not to, surveys then found that the overwhelming majority of officers backed the use of the hold and said they saw no danger in its use.The double tragedy in the Garner slaying was, of course, his senseless death but also that his death does not alter the fact that the chokehold still remains on the official books as a weapon that police officers can use.

We can’t summarize all of our work on him — he’s tagged in at least 40 stories since 2011 — so we will focus here on remarks he has made on some of the major issues of the day.Climate ChangeAt a campaign event in February 2012, Santorum called climate change a “hoax,” saying “man-made global warming” and the remedy for it were “bogus.” As we said at the time, climate scientists overwhelmingly agree that global warming is real and human activities are making it worse. A paper published in 2010 by the National Academy of Sciences found that 97 percent to 98 percent of climate researchers “most actively publishing in the field” agreed that climate change was occurring and humans were responsible for “most” of it.More recently, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finalized a report on Nov. 2 that said it’s “extremely likely” that human activity is “the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century.” At the time of Santorum’s remarks, the IPCC said human activity was “very likely” the main reason for global warming. (“Extremely likely” means that there’s a 95 percent to 100 percent probability that humans are the main cause of climate change, while “very likely” places the odds at between 90 percent and 95 percent, as explained in a Sept. 27, 2013 IPCC press release on the report’s draft findings.)ImmigrationSantorum made two statements on legal and illegal immigration this year that caught our attention.The senator falsely claimed in July that the U.S. is “accepting more legal immigrants than we ever have.” We found that the number of people granted lawful permanent resident status decreased consecutively for two fiscal years. In 2013, there were 990,553 foreign-born individuals who became lawful permanent residents, down from 1,031,631 in 2012 and 1,062,040 in 2011, according to the Department of Homeland Security. The historical high for lawful immigration was in 1991, when 1,826,595 people obtained permanent resident status, which DHS attributes to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 signed into law by then-President Ronald Reagan.He also said in November that there were “more people living in this country who were not born here than at any other time in the history of the country.” That’s true in raw numbers, as we wrote, but a greater percentage of the population was foreign-born from 1860 to 1920. In 2010, 12.9 percent of the country’s population was foreign-born, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The peak was in 1890, when 14.8 percent of the population was born outside the United States.AbortionThe senator, who opposes abortion, got several facts wrong during a New Hampshire radio talk show in 2011. While blaming abortions for “causing Social Security and Medicare to be underfunded,” Santorum incorrectly claimed that “one in three pregnancies end in abortion” in the United States. It’s actually fewer than one in four, according to a March 2011 report by the Guttmacher Institute.During the same show, Santorum also wrongly claimed that “our birthrate is now below replacement rate for the first time in our history.” As we said at the time: The total fertility rate, not the birthrate, is used to determine the stability of a nation’s population, and the U.S. total fertility rate was below its replacement rate from 1972 to 2005, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Safety Net ProgramsDuring the 2012 campaign, Republicans attacked President Obama for increasing the poor’s dependency on government programs, particularly food stamps and welfare.In August 2012, Santorum blamed Obama for creating “a nightmare of dependency” that resulted in “almost half of America receiving some sort of government assistance.” But we found Santorum’s figures included senior citizens on Social Security and Medicare who paid into those government programs.The Census Bureau’s income and program participation surveys estimate the number of Americans who are enrolled in at least one government program. The four largest programs — those with at least 40 million recipients — are Medicaid, Social Security, food stamps and Medicare. At the time of his remarks, the Census Bureau reported that 49 percent of Americans were enrolled in at least one government program, up from 44.4 percent of Americans in the third quarter of 2008 when George W. Bush was president.In fact, the Census Bureau echoed Santorum’s language to describe program participation in 2008, saying “nearly half of U.S. residents live in households receiving government benefits.”Education Appearing on a Sunday talk show in February 2012, Santorum discussed the need to improve the nation’s education system. But, in doing so, he wrongly claimed that “one of three children drop out of school” in the U.S.As we wrote in “Santorum Exaggerates Dropout Rate,” the “status dropout rate” — the percentage of those ages 16 to 24 who were not in school or had not obtained a GED — was 8.1 percent in 2009. The 2009 rate — the most recent data available at the time — was slightly higher than it was in 2008, but it was down significantly from the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and even early 2000s, according to the Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics.The center also measures the “event dropout rate,” which is the percentage of public school students in grades 9 through 12 who dropped out of school “between one October and the next.” In 2007-2008, that rate was 4.1 percent."
