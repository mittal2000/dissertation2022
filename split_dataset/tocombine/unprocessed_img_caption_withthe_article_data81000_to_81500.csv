His name, several of his relatives told Reuters, was Rafiq Kamel Rafiq and he was 21 years old.Abbas's office said in a statement that the president held the Israeli government responsible for the death.""The crime was a continuation of the daily killing which no one can be silent at,"" said the statement published by WAFA.Earlier on HuffPost:"

Today, we speak with Christoph Wilcke about the efforts to document crimes against the Yazidis. The remains of 67 people found in mass graves in northern Iraq were finally laid to rest this week, Kurdish media reported. They were members of Iraq's Yazidi minority, killed by the Islamic State militant group, also known as ISIS, as it rampaged through the community's homelands near Mount Sinjar one year ago, according to Rudaw news agency.The extremist group, which deems Yazidis to be heretics, massacred several thousand Yazidis and took some 5,000 captive, forcing women and children into sex slavery, according to Yazidi leaders and the United Nations. U.N. human rights investigators said earlier this year their evidence shows that Islamic State militants likely committed genocide, intending ""to destroy the Yazidi as a group.""In the year since the massacre began, Yazidi activists and the Kurdish semi-autonomous government in northern Iraq have tried to facilitate the escape of hundreds of captives and make sure a suspected genocide does not go unrecorded. But it is dangerous and difficult work, in a region that is still fending off Islamic State attacks.The WorldPost spoke to Christoph Wilcke, senior researcher for the Middle East and North Africa at Human Rights Watch, about his work helping to document crimes committed against the Yazidis. What have you found out through your field work about what happened to the Yazidis since the rise of the Islamic State?From early on, we've been documenting the onslaught on the Yazidis and the thousands who fled to Sinjar mountain and then to the Kurdish region. Since then we've put a focus on documenting and publicizing the enslavement, captivity and sexual abuse of Yazidi women by ISIS. You wrote recently about visiting mass graves. What did you find there? I first tried to help Kurdish authorities get in touch with international experts to document the mass grave sites in January, but when I returned in April I was surprised to find that nothing had happened. So I wanted to go myself and see the state of the graves, the bodies and whether the sites were protected. I went to seven mass grave sites with local police and I found there wasn't a single body there. They said the bodies were decomposed and their bones scattered by wild animals, so they had to collect the remains and other evidence and take it to the Forensic Medicine Institute in Dohuk. It's a pity. If they had international experts, they could have done forensic analysis at the site. Now some of that evidence is potentially lost.The Kurdish side and the Yazidi side both strongly want the bodies identified, buried and to move on. Who is responsible for collecting the evidence?The genocide committee in Dohuk [of the Kurdistan Regional Government] is the body taking the statements of the Yazidis who survived enslavement, captivity and sex slavery. A judge records their statements. They are also in charge of protecting the mass graves.This all took place in Nineveh province, which is technically under the control of [the central Iraqi government in] Baghdad. But the Kurds have long exercised control over the area and expanded it since the rise of ISIS. So, the Baghdad government hasn't set foot in the area. People laugh at me if I ask whether anyone from Baghdad human rights ministry has visited the sites. They say, ""For them, we don't exist."" People in Baghdad say this was very sad but it's not part of our responsibility and the Kurds are taking care of it. What about international assistance?The U.N. called for more protection of the mass grave sites in January, but it's not high on their priority list, which is perhaps understandable given that they are dealing with the current killings. After my trip in April, I made calls to international organizations to check that no international experts had gone. No one has taken the initiative. And the Kurds haven't prioritized asking for help. On the one hand, there is a clamor that this was genocide. On the other hand, the effort to gather evidence to make that claim is not really being done.

This may be our best bet to capture and try people.In Iraq, so few ISIS fighters have been captured on the battlefield. There are sleeper cells and sympathizers who have been arrested but they're probably not part of the killing machine. It depends on how much territory Iraq is able to recapture from ISIS. Then they can try Iraqis under Iraqi law. This is not an international armed conflict so they are not prisoners of war.The adjudication is a matter for the Iraqi authorities. Iraq is not part of the International Criminal Court -- it said it would consider joining but has not. Iraq could enter a case for temporary jurisdiction, for certain crimes during a certain time period, but it has not. There is also no law against genocide or war crimes in Iraqi law.We hope that there will be accountability. Right now there is a strong sense of collective guilt, that all ISIS are genocidal. In order to move forward, it is important to say this specific person committed a crime. Maybe we will find out that some commanders refused orders. Maybe we will learn something more about the organization. We don't want to label all Sunnis or all Shia or all Kurds guilty. There has to be individual accountability. What did Yazidi survivors tell you about their hopes for justice?In my limited interactions, the call for justice was not their first and foremost priority. The Yazidis are in a kind of personal and collective shock, and just thankful for those who survived.

3,RELIGION,"""War Room"" Has The One Thing Many Christian Films Don't Have -- A Black Cast","Jonathan Merritt, Religion News Service",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/war-room-christian-movie_us_55ce62bfe4b0ab468d9d6933,“There is an element to the way we tell this story that has power and desperation that would be different if we tried to tell it any other way.”,2015-08-15,"<p><span style=""font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; background-color: #eeeeee;"">Karen Abercrombie, left, and Priscilla Shirer in ""War Room.""</span></p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ce687a1400002e002e2fef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Last year, a flood of faith films starring white actors led many to charge that Hollywood was standing in the way of racial progress. But religious audiences can witness a stark departure from this troubling trend when “War Room” hits theaters on Aug. 28.The fifth feature film produced by successful Christian moviemakers Alex and Stephen Kendrick tells a story about the power of prayer. It does so with an almost entirely African-American cast, including New York Times best-selling Christian author Priscilla Shirer, in her movie debut.“There is an element to the way we tell this story that has power and desperation that would be different if we tried to tell it any other way,” Alex Kendrick said of his decision to opt for a black cast. He says when executives from their distributor (Sony’s Affirm Films) viewed it for the first time, they responded, “If this had been told with a different race, it would be a different movie.”“War Room” arrives at a time when racial tensions in America have intensified as a result of police brutality cases and the racially motivated slaying of black worshippers by a white shooter in Charleston, S.C. Those involved with the film say they don’t believe the timing of its release is a coincidence, and they think that the message of “War Room” might have the power to usher in reconciliation in America.Actor T.C. Stallings says he accepted the male lead role in the film because of the positive picture it paints of the African-American family. Stallings grew up in a “stereotypical stigma of a black family” in inner-city Cleveland. He didn’t meet his drug-addicted father until he was 19 years old. His siblings all dropped out of high school and spent time in jail. And his neighborhood was riddled with gangs and crime.Black children in such settings often repeat the same mistakes because the entertainment industry often portrays black families and communities poorly, Stallings said.“What I saw on TV and in movies growing up was all negative. The picture of African-Americans in urban areas was all bad language and bad credit scores and bad habits,” Stallings said. “There were many upstanding, Christian black families in the world, and they needed to be talked about as well.”Stallings rejected the black family stereotype he was seeing, graduating from high school and college. Today, he resides in California with his wife and two children, whom Stallings helps home-school.“There are many people out there — white and black — who stay with their families and work through their problems. They aren’t thugs or gang leaders,” He said. “’War Room’ tells the truth about society by showing the reverse of that stereotype.”Shirer agrees with Stallings that the entertainment industry often shows “the breakdown of the family unit instead of the health and wholeness that is possible and happening in many African-American families.” But she chose to be a part of the film because of its emphasis on prayer.“War Room” draws a parallel between a “prayer closet,” a term referring to a secluded place where Christians pray, and where military officials develop a strategy before they go to war. The movie paints a picture of what it looks like to fight life’s greatest problems with prayer. Shirer believes that no problem is too big to be overcome through prayer, even the problem of racism.“Prayer is the only thing that will make a lasting difference in the race conversation,” Shirer said. “We can have symposiums or pass policies to get people to behave in the way we would like them to, but for lasting change to take place in the hearts of our people and our nation, God must be involved.”Shirer has written a companion book for the film, “Fervent: A Woman’s Battle Plan for Serious, Specific, and Strategic Prayer,” released last week.“War Room” was produced on a $3 million budget and is expected to make much more in ticket sales. The Kendrick brothers’ films have always earned back their budgets. Their last movie, “Courageous,” for example, was produced for $2 million and earned $34.5 million in box office receipts to become one of the most successful independent films of 2011.The unanswered question when it comes to “War Room” is not whether it will make money, but whether it can induce change in a nation increasingly split across racial lines.“Racial tension is dangerous and people are dying and a lot of us want to see that stopped,” Stallings said. “We protest and speak out and tweet out, but this problem is much bigger than human beings. This movie will give people a way to take these problems to the Lord and show them that prayer is the best weapon to fight back.”(Jonathan Merritt is senior columnist for Religion News Service and the author of “Jesus is Better Than You Imagined” and “A Faith of Our Own: Following Jesus Beyond the Culture Wars.” He lives in Brooklyn, N.Y.)"

Adm. Zacharias served as deputy intelligence director for the navy in World War II. (AP Photo/WJS)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc15813240000350022a358.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The public release of the master recording of Gyokuon-hoso, Emperor Hirohito's speech announcing Japan's acceptance of the Potsdam Declaration, ahead of the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II on September 2, has been received with significant interest. Movies have captured the rift between the Japanese military -- which sought to press forward with the war -- and proponents of peace, as well as Japanese soldiers' attempt to prevent Gyokuon-hoso from being broadcast on the radio. Meanwhile, an American who played a significant role in achieving peace has received very little attention. Radio played an extremely crucial role in The Pacific War, specifically in Japanese and American propaganda. The majority of content aired was part of a fierce information war. But Radio started to change in May 1945, when Japan became the sole country fighting the Allied Forces after Germany's unconditional surrender. It was one month after Kantaro Suzuki assumed office as Prime Minister. The Americans were using a facility inside the Department of the Interior in Washington D.C. as a radio studio. I visited the studio, which is preserved to this day in its war-era state. After Germany surrendered, the studio started to broadcast messages calling for peace in Japan. A document titled ""Peace Talk,"" which archived Japan's reactions to the broadcasts, along with the original audio recordings, still remains in the U.S. National Archives.Naval Captain Ellis Zacharias was broadcasting from the U.S. at the time. ""Unconditional surrender in no way means the full-on destruction nor the enslavement of the Japanese people. By renouncing all resistance, you yourselves can save the Japanese state,"" he said in one of his broadcasts. Who exactly was Captain Zacharias, beyond being fluent in Japanese and giving himself the title of official spokesman of the U.S. Government? I went to the state of Pennsylvania to visit his son and find some answers. What Captain Zacharias's son, Gerard, showed me was nothing short of a commemorative album of Emperor Hirohito's Sokui no Rei (the enthronement ceremony of the Japanese emperor). Prior to the war, Zacharias, who had been stationed in Japan as an attaché at the U.S. Embassy, had mastered Japanese and is said to have been known as the U.S. military's top authority on Japan.""My father loved Japan. Said it was a very beautiful country,"" Gerard said. Nostalgic, he then showed me a photo: It was a shot of Emperor Hirohito's younger brother, Prince Takamatsu, the Princess, and Zacharias, who had been appointed as their escort during their visit to the United States for their honeymoon. During his stay in Japan, Zacharias was often invited to imperial family events. He developed a particularly close friendship with Prince Takamatsu.Distressed over Japan's steady demise, Zacharias told his son: ""There is no reason to continue this awful war any longer. At this rate, millions -- tens of millions -- of lives may be lost. I started broadcasting to rescue those lives."" In his broadcasts, Zacharias addressed Japan's imperial family directly.In his book, Secret Missions: The Story of an Intelligence Officer, Zacharias wrote: ""I reached out to the Emperor thinking he was the one and only person who could decide on Japan's surrender.""In his first broadcast, Zacharias said: ""Prime Minister, Admiral Baron Suzuki, surely you remember your talks with me. With all due respect, Prince and Princess Takamatsu, I implore you to recall your visit to America. I believe that those who know me personally will trust me.""In a later interview, Zacharias explained: ""As he was able to express his opinion to the Emperor, Prince Takamatsu's participation was the most important.""Diplomatic critic Hideaki Kase, who was a close friend of Prince Takamatsu's, recounts hearing about an exchange between Emperor Hirohito and the Prince. ""Prince Takamatsu was a captain in the Naval Command, but he wrote letters to the Emperor. The Navy had lost its artillery force, and so pinned against the ropes, he wrote a private letter to his brother, the Emperor, imploring him to consider peace.""How did Japan respond to these radio addresses from Zacharias? Along with receiving messages from Price Takamatsu, the emperor heard from Foreign Minister Shigenori Togo's Secretary, as well as proponent of peace Toshikazu Kase. In a 2001 interview, Kase said ""There were several Zacharias broadcasts, the most important of which I assume reached the Emperor. It would have been awful if had they been American propaganda, but then again, depending on how you look at it, he needed to have the courage to go along with it even if he knew it was propaganda. He understood very well that there was no way to make a breakthrough in the situation otherwise.""As the war drew to a close, Japan sought to preserve the structure of the state. In response, Zacharias said in his 21st broadcast: ""There are two choices facing the leaders of Japan. One of those is unconditional surrender exactly as in the Atlantic Covenant and the blessings that go along with it.""Article 3 of the Atlantic Charter established in 1941 mandated: ""Following the war, it shall be guaranteed that all people have the right to choose their form of government."" In other words, Zacharias was suggesting that even after an unconditional surrender, it would be possible for Japan to preserve its imperial system.The Japanese government took action the same night that this broadcast aired. An emergency confidential telegram from Foreign Minister Togo read: ""The remarks of Captain Zacharias merit attention. I have no objection against the restoration of peace on the foundations of the Atlantic Charter."" The Allied Forces announced the Potsdam Declaration calling for Japan's surrender the following day. However, it made Zacharias furious; there was no inkling of the preservation of the national structure that the Japanese government demanded. Gerard said he will never forget his father trembling in anger then. ""Dad was upset, wondering why there was no clause about the continuation of the imperial system in the Potsdam Declaration. He knew that the focus of the negotiations was the continuance of the imperial system.""Zacharias then terminated Peace Talk. The atomic bombs were dropped on August 6 in Hiroshima, then on August 9 in Nagasaki.Zacharias's aspirations had not been reflected in the Potsdam Declaration. He felt helpless at not being able to stop the dropping of the atomic bombs, and was utterly disheartened. A year after, a letter showed up at Zacharias's doorstep. It was from Ellis McEvoy, who had been stationed in Tokyo and was a colleague of Zacharias's during his time in the Naval Intelligence Department.""When I was having supper with Prince Takamatsu, he told me, 'Zacharias's broadcasts gave the proponents of peace the ammunition needed to take down the military, arguing for the defense of the Japanese homeland. Had the war continued, no doubt horrifying results would have awaited both sides'."" Gerard remembers how his father had showed him this letter, looking truly happy.""Ammunition for the proponents of peace."" Behind that ammunition, I believe, was a series of interactions and the trust Zacharias had fostered with the Japanese, along with a deep, mutual understanding of each other's cultures."

And they can't wait to get out of this predicament.",2015-08-15,2015-08-15-1439608194-4104923-Ukraineinflation.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-08-15-1439608194-4104923-Ukraineinflation-thumb.jpg,"In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, central banks around the world have become the largest, most powerful, and exceedingly profitable financial institutions. And they can't wait to get out of this predicament. Central banks are not profit centers. Their main task is to keep inflation on target, while making sure that economic growth is close to its potential. In this essay I argue that in 2011, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), the country's central bank, made money so scarce that inflation ended up well below the target and the country's fragile economic recovery turned into a massive recession that continues to this day. I also argue that the NBU should not take an aggressive anti-inflationary stance before economic growth has returned to its potential.In order to make these arguments, I need to explain the basics of central bank operations. A good place to start is a so-called ""balance sheet"". Like any bank, the NBU has a balance sheet. The NBU balance sheet has two sides: assets and liabilities. Assets are what the NBU buys - foreign currency and gold for its reserves, domestic government debt, the debt of commercial and state-owned banks, and so forth. Liabilities are what the NBU uses to pay for the assets - notes and coins in circulation that it can ""issue"" or ""print"", money that commercial and state-owned banks are required to keep on deposits at the central bank, money that government entities hold at the central bank, money that international organizations like the IMF hold there, debt obligations like certificates of deposits and so forth. Every year, the NBU publishes its annual report in which it discloses its assets and liabilities. The NBU balance sheet for the last 15 years - compiled from its annual reports and scaled by the country's nominal GDP as calculated by the State Statistics Agency of Ukraine- is summarized in the chart below. For illustrative purposes, assets are presented as positive numbers (a ""purchase"") and liabilities as negative numbers (a ""payment"").From the chart, we can see that the assets and liabilities of a central bank expand and contract from year to year reflecting macroeconomic policies and conditions. If a central bank wants to use its balance sheet to do a bit more to stimulate economic activity, e.g., following a crisis, it can do it in three main ways: inject additional money into circulation; allow commercial banks to hold less money in their central bank accounts (this gives more money to the banks to spend elsewhere); and sell less in central bank securities to the financial sector (this also leaves more money in the hands of the financial sector). During 2008-2009, after the global financial crisis really hit Ukraine's economy, the NBU did just that: the notes and coins in circulation went up, the money in commercial banks sitting in central bank deposits went down, and the sales of central bank certificates of deposit went down as well. For example, during 2008-2009, the NBU increased notes and coins in circulation from 16.3 percent of GDP at the end of 2007 to 18 percent of GDP at the end 2009 - a 10.4 percent increase. By conducting balance sheet operations, the NBU effectively provided a ""monetary stimulus"" to the economy. The ""monetary stimulus"" works if enough of this extra money ends up being invested in real economic projects proposed to the banks by various companies.Before we look at what has been happening to Ukraine's companies, now it's time to mention that for some reason during 2011, the NBU reduced notes and coins in circulation by 13 percent - from 17.9 percent of GDP at the end of 2010 to 15.5 percent of GDP at the end of 2011. A 13 percent reduction in notes and coins circulating in the economy in one year is a really big adjustment. A central bank balance sheet adjustment of this magnitude can be warranted when an economy is really ""overheated"" or an asset ""bubble"" is growing somewhere in the financial sector (real estate, particular securities, certain investment projects, etc.) To see if the economy was getting overheated, let's look at the companies.In order to consistently add value, companies need to make at least enough money on their projects to pay interest to the banks and taxes to the government. In the periodic reports that companies have to submit to their governments and shareholders, this economic viability shows up as something called earnings before interest and taxes. Earnings before interest in taxes for the total economy and by key economic sectors - compiled by the State Statistics Agency of Ukraine and scaled by the country's nominal GDP - are in the charts below.In the charts above, it looks like whole sectors of the economy have experienced small, or negative earnings for several years now. This chart, by the way, should be shown to the holders of Ukraine's external sovereign bonds as Exhibit 1 that the country really does not have the economic capacity to repay them. Such a long period of low or negative earnings--before interest and taxes--does not seem be a temporary phenomenon and is unlikely to turn around anytime soon. Ukraine seems to have gotten stuck between an industrial, resource-based past and a post-industrial, innovation-based future. To help Ukraine get out of this economic limbo, its sovereign debt burden must be reduced.Now back to the companies. One way for the companies to stay viable no matter whether they are resource or innovation-based is to raise prices for whatever it is they are producing and selling to each other and to their ultimate consumers. If these price increases are widespread enough, they show up in the government surveys as producer or consumer price inflation. The dynamics of producer and consumer price indices put together by the State Statistics Agency of Ukraine are presented below.And now, we are about to come full circle. Central banks, including the NBU, are mandated by the laws of their countries to keep the value of their currency ""stable"", so that companies and individuals continue using the national currency instead of switching to another currency. The stability of the currency is typically proxied by domestic price inflation. Low and steady price inflation means that the national currency--in the case of Ukraine, the hryvnya--is stable; high and very volatile inflation means that it is not stable. Another indicator of currency stability is its exchange rate against a major currency, for example, the US dollar. However, if the exchange rate is fixed or heavily managed, as has been the case in Ukraine, the instability of a national currency could build up for a long time without being noticed until it suddenly manifests itself in a devaluation episode, which, in the end, shows up as a spike in domestic inflation.So, a central bank is mandated to keep inflation low and steady, but, in many cases, including Ukraine's, the central bank is also supposed to support economic growth. Monetary policy is about squaring this circle: On the one hand, a central bank needs to create more money, channel it to the commercial banks, and ""encourage"" the banks to lend it to companies. But, companies need to earn enough to pay interest and taxes, so they have to raise prices at least somewhat, which will show up as inflation and make the central bank reduce the amount of money that goes to the banks and so on. Central banks around the world keep squaring this circle all the time. On top of that, central banks need to keep their financial systems healthy; react to spillovers into the domestic economies from the global economy; and be vigilant about the effects of financial innovations such as new instruments, trading practices, and payment systems.This is not an easy job, and to in order to do it well, central banks get as much data as they can get their hands on and bring in economic and statistical brains and equipment to comb through this data. The world's top central banks maintain economics departments that dwarf those of top universities. But, in spite of these brains and data and equipment, central banks still get things wrong all the time. Sometimes, the central banks get it really wrong, know they got it really wrong, but can't do much about it (due to domestic politics). Sometimes, they get it really wrong, don't know they got it really wrong, and, go on bragging about it. The latter is what I think happened in Ukraine in 2011.So, what seems to have happened in 2011? Let's look at the balance sheet of the NBU. During 2011, the balance sheet of the NBU shrinks by 17.2 percent. As mentioned above, during that year, notes and coins in circulation were reduced by 13 percent. By doing so, the NBU starved the nascent economic recovery that was just barely taking hold. A glance at the earnings numbers tells us that - after a small positive bump in the companies' earnings from 2010 to 2011, earnings went into the negative territory across the board. Negative earnings means that companies have to dip into other means (such as the cash they were going to use to expand their business activity) to pay interest and taxes. If this goes on for several years, as it has in Ukraine, the problems accumulate - banks end up getting saddled with nonperforming company loans and the government ends up collecting less in taxes, plus companies go out of business and have to lay off people.How did the NBU end up starving the economy in 2011? In order to fight inflation, it made the money that was available to the economy too scarce. The NBU proudly reports in its 2011 annual report that it has successfully forced inflation to historically low levels. Here is a quote:Yes, central bank balance sheet adjustments that result in a 13 percent contraction of notes and coins available to the economy in one year would bring inflation down a lot. But, it would bring economic activity down as well. Why would the NBU do something like that? One possibility (and that's a benign interpretation) is that the NBU has misjudged the strength of the economic recovery. It thought that the economy is firmly on the path to recovery and it is time to reign in the prices. That was really wrong. Lots of economic indicators, including stagnant company earnings and asset prices, suggest that it was wrong, but the NBU kept on tightening everyone's belts all the way to the end of 2013. Only the forced removal of the NBU management in the beginning of 2014 reversed that policy, but it was too late. The economy went into a massive sustained decline and is yet to find the bottom.What is the lesson for people in charge of the NBU? Please don't start fighting inflation too early. And when you do, please don't fight it too aggressively. Yes, I know it sounds bad and, yes, the program with the IMF states that the NBU has to start bringing inflation down to some low levels at some point in the future. Let that time not be 2015 or even 2016 or any time until the economy turns the corner and the companies' earnings go into the positive territory across the board. I believe producer price inflation of one to one and a half percent per month is a reasonable number to be comfortable with for the foreseeable future. If this means that notes and coins in circulation swell to over 20 percent of the GDP, so be it. The key task right now is to get the economy growing again. Getting growth out of Ukraine's battered economy would not be an easy task. There are massive structural problems in Ukraine's economy - a lot of its growth comes from resource-based projects running on old assets and cheap labor. There are serious problems in the banking system - nonperforming loans, investments in nonviable projects, and value-destroying business plans. There are a lot of problems with financing the government and its pet projects, including incumbent electoral campaigns and state monopolies. To satisfy government financing needs, the NBU has been buying government bonds and ""transferring its profits."" On top of that, there is conflict, destruction, and refugees that need to be taken care of. Solid domestic economic growth is desperately needed in order to deal with all of this. As for the NBU policies that began in 2011 and continued into 2013, they were followed by a loss of human lives, massive suffering and a huge and continuing destruction of values. My hope is that this lesson is learned and the policies of tightening the money supply too early are not repeated too soon.Disclaimer. These are my personal views.

While the focus of this essay is on the balance sheet, there is also, of course, something called off-balance sheet items. We leave them aside for the time being, but the recent acknowledgment of the existence of a swap line with the People's Bank of China valued at close to 2.4 billion US dollars is a sign that the NBU is not averse to taking on significant off-balance sheet items. 2.

Our already easily distracted media culture is on tilt from the advent of ""The Donald"" as Republican presidential frontrunner.The rise of his Big Mouth/Big Money campaign not only speaks volumes about the devolutionary state of our politics, it's created a goofball kind of hysteria. Still, it's odd that the vast majority of the coverage of Jeb Bush's attack on Hillary Clinton -- which he launched Tuesday night at a Reagan Library speech outside LA and continued in subsequent appearances and interviews -- doesn't mention some very big news. The wannabe dynast wants the US to get heavily involved in yet another Middle Eastern war.That would be the Syrian civil war, against President Bashar al-Assad, whose regime is battling Isis. The rise of which John Ellis ""JEB"" Bush is trying to blame on former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.In a speech at the Reagan Library outside Los Angeles, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush tried again to spin up a winning argument on the Iraq debacle. He blamed former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton for the rise of Isis and, in a move largely missed by the media, called for US intervention in the Syrian civil war.The media has gotten the ""blame Hillary"" part of Jeb's equation down. Not hard, since it's his attempt to play ""Who Lost Iraq?"" without forfeiting right off on account of the settled stupidity of his brother's administration invading Iraq in the first place. The Syria stuff, though, went whizzing right over most people's heads.Frankly, no one named Bush should be proposing anything in the Middle East. Especially a Bush who has 17 of 21 formally named geopolitical advisors who are alumni of the Bush/Cheney administration. And especially a Bush who also started out in the spring defending the boneheaded invasion, the first of five different statements on Iraq he made that week before finally admitting it was a disastrous idea. As it happens, we're already, under the Obama administration, training some Syrian rebels in Saudi Arabia, at the behest of that longtime ally of the Bush family which is every bit as insistent as Israel in pushing an agenda for American action in the Middle East. But Bush wants more, to send weapons, create a no-fly zone over Syria, and establish ""safe zones"" within Syria guaranteed by US arms.That would put us against opponents of the group Bush claims he has a top priority in defeating. And it would infuriate the Syrian regime's longtime allies Iran and Russia. But coherence is not exactly a hallmark of Bushian interventionism. And at some point it may occur to us that keeping the world riled up is a fundamental part of the Bush agenda. So is Hillary responsible for the rise of Isis? Er, no. True, the US did not leave a large residual force behind in Iraq after the main force withdrawal. But the withdrawal was actually set by George W. Bush. And it was the Bush/Cheney administration's handpicked Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki who refused to allow the US to leave any significant force behind. He turned out to be much more pro-Iranian than pro-American. Just like Ahmed Chalabi, who provided mucho bogus intel to the Bush/Cheney administration in the run-up to the 2003 US invasion. Maliki's pro-Shiite, anti-Sunni stance as prime minister did much to drive the rise of Isis.Where President Barack Obama can be blamed is in wasting months in analysis/paralysis and pointless diplomatic maneuvering before launching air strikes against Isis. The Isis forces which rampaged across Iraq and Syria were not guerrillas as we think of them from the Vietnam War. They were motorized infantry, often moving across open country, very prone to devastation from air attacks, as I wrote at the time.But none of that is Hillary Clinton's fault. She was long gone as secretary of state.Now we're attacking, of course, but it's much harder to win from the air when going against established facts on the ground. Especially when the Iraqi Army -- despite the billions Bush and Cheney spent on it, not to mention Obama's more recent efforts to help rebuild it -- is a battlefield bust.Jeb Bush is trying to say now that the Iraq War was won by the ""surge"" of 2007, when five Army brigades of additional combat troops were sent to strategic areas of the country, Marine deployments were extended, and vast sums of money were paid to Sunni militant leaders. That decreased violence in Iraq for a while, as you might expect. But it was not a sustainable situation, the Sunni militants didn't stay bought, and a viable and fair Iraqi state -- something unlikely in what became, during the US occupation, one of the most corrupt places on the planet -- was no further along than before. What the surge did was allow us to get out without having to jump for helicopter skids from the roof of the US embassy. Mission UN-accomplished.The problem for Jeb Bush is that, as another well-known politician once said, facts are stubborn things. He can twist and turn on this, but the more he does, the more grist for the mill he creates.Of course, his other big problem is actually winning the Republican nomination. For all Hillary Clinton's undoubted stumbles, she has been a far more impressive performer than Bush. Facebook comments are closed on this article.William Bradley Archive"

But before she rose to prominence, she had served in the OSS during World War II and experienced the life of a Foreign Service spouse when she married Paul Child, who served in the U.S. Information Agency (USIA).Below are excerpts from a brief 1991 oral history with ADST in which she discusses her love of French cuisine and the ugly shadow of McCarthyism.You can read the rest of this account on ADST.org  CHILD: When I was in the Foreign Service, they didn't really pay attention to wives at all. A lot of them never learned the language, or did anything....We were in World War II, we were in the OSS [Office of Strategic Services] and we met in Ceylon, or Sri Lanka, it was Ceylon then. Then we went up to China and we were there when the bomb dropped. Then we came back to Washington and Paul's OSS Department -- they called it visual presentation, maps, diagrams, war rooms and things like that -- became the U.S. Information Agency. Paul had spent a lot of his young manhood in France and spoke beautiful French, really practically bilingual.When they were setting up the USIS [United States Information Service] in Paris, he was asked to go over, which was of course wonderful for us. And then, I had never had French food before. And I just fell in love with French food from the first bite. We came over, I think it was on the SS America with our old blue Buick, and our first French meal, or my French meal was in Rouen and I never, never turned back after that.After we had gotten settled, I enrolled in the Cordon Bleu [the French cooking school originally founded to give orphans a profession] and I was fortunately able to join a group of GIs on the [GI] Bill of Rights and we had a wonderful old chef [Max Bugnard] who had trained under Escoffier and was a real classicist and a wonderful man. We would start at seven in the morning and cook until about eleven. Then I would rush home and cook Paul a fancy lunch and go back again. Q: And you were the only woman in the class? CHILD: I was the only woman in that class with the men. I just became passionate, I had been looking for a career all my life. I wanted to be on the New Yorker or something like that. Well, this was it. I was passionately interested in it, the tremendous care that all the chefs and teachers took. It was art for art's sake. It made no difference how long it took. If it came out beautifully, that was it. That was very appealing. Luckily at that time I had met my French colleague, Simone Beck. There wasn't anyone to talk to of my own type. We had mutual friends who introduced me to Simca, as she was known, and Jean at a cocktail party and we literally embraced each other immediately because she felt the same way about, ""Whom can I talk to!"" She had a colleague, Louisette Bertholle, and the two of them were working together on a book on French cooking for Americans. So we started our cooking school about the next day and we called it the École des Trois Gourmandes, the School of the Three Hearty Eaters. That really started us seriously. Then their collaborator died, and that pleased me very much. I never knew him. Good timing.So we started in on our book together, and that took a long gestation period. It wasn't done until our last post in Norway, which was in '59. When we got to Oslo there was an American Women's Club and I remember the first luncheon I went to, which would have been in probably '59. It was a typical ladies' luncheon.  They had a salad made out of Jell-O, I guess, and it had bananas and grapes and marshmallows and it was shaped -- and really it looked like a phallic symbol! It was sitting on a little piece of lettuce, you couldn't hide it under anything. Then it ended with one of those cake mix cakes with a white mountain of coconut frosting. Horrible! And some of us got together and said, ""Never again!"" So we had a cooking committee so we couldn't end up with anything like that again.I gave cooking lessons there in Norway with a mixed -- Norway was an awfully nice post. Oslo, we just loved it. After Norway, Paul had said that when he was sixty, he was going to retire because he never really liked the bureaucracy at all. And so we left when he was sixty, and that's when my book [Mastering the Art of French Cooking] came out. And he helped me with all of that. He helped me with proof reading and the index. He's a wonderful photographer, so he did photographs from which we had a sketch artist do drawings. So it was wonderful having him.Q: He was very supportive, wasn't he? CHILD: Oh, very, in everything. He was a prime dishwasher and baggage carrier. And then he was good intellectually for me, for I was rather messy intellectually. But he would always talk about the operational proof, and things like that. We had a very good time together....Q: And also, to be able to go from your lessons to all of the delightful little restaurants around Paris.CHILD: Yes, and what was wonderful. Those were the days of the classic cuisine, and it was so good. It was delicious. Just a plain roast chicken was so good. That was before they had learned to do battery raised chicken. They really tasted like chicken. And delicious vegetables and salads and cheeses, and so forth.Q: While you were learning at class, you must have gone to little restaurants.CHILD: Oh, in the old days, I think Paul's salary was $6,000 and I got $100 a month from my family. But we had envelopes, and we each had $2 a week allowance, and we had everything budgeted out and we very carefully saved everything for going out. But even so we could go out two or three times a week, and even a great restaurant like the Grand Véfour was only about $3.50. Or was it $10? I think maybe it was $10. But you could eat beautifully for a reasonable price. But we had to watch every penny.CHILD: During the McCarthy thing we were in Marseilles, and when [Roy] Cohn and [David] Schine [reference to an infamous European trip made by McCarthy's two bullying assistants] came through, I think we were still there. We went up to Paris shortly afterwards. They [Cohn and Schine] had arrived in Paris and of course they went out to all the nightclubs and so forth, and it happened to be during Easter, and on Easter Sunday they had called a meeting that everyone was to get there at eight o'clock a.m. at the USIS office.Of course, they didn't appear. It turned out that when they finally got hold of them, they were sleeping off a night at Montmartre. They had ruined everyone's weekend. I remember they were charging though the USIS and [cultural attaché] Larry Morris came in and saw Cohn sitting at his desk with his feet on his desk. Larry Morris said, ""Get out of that chair. Get your feet off my desk."" But most people were scared to do anything. They were also the kind of people that if you really came at them, they would back right off. But most people didn't dare. I remember Allen Dulles [Director of the Central Intelligence Agency in the early 1950s], as I was told, when they wanted to investigate the CIA, he said, ""If you are going to investigate anyone, you can investigate me."" They never touched him.But if you cringed, they were right on top of you. I never met them myself. There were also the people who just cravenly fell down in front of them. And we had quite a number of people who were just ruined by them. John Carter Vincent [Minister to Switzerland (1947-51] was one of the China Hands drummed out of the Foreign Service by McCarthy's tactics. Vincent and others were accused of ""losing China"" to the Chinese communists led by Mao Tse-tung. It was horrible what they did to him....  Q: Well, maybe one post there, who knows. Your husband sounds like a very interesting man. CHILD: Black belt in judo, and photographer and painter. He was not a bureaucratic man. What he liked to do was have his work and do it. And he was never ambitious. I know there were some of them in the Paris embassy who would go in on Sundays and Saturdays, busy work, so people could see they were there. Paul left as soon as he could leave, and did his work, and he just didn't get into the politics of the bureaucracy at all, so he never rose very far."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Monday.Tom Buffenbarger, IAM's president, said in a statement that the union didn't want to stay quiet while the fight is ""so clearly underway.""""Hillary Clinton has been a strong supporter of this union for years and she is now the target of unprecedented attacks, financed on a scale never seen before,"" Buffenbarger said. ""The time to help is when help is needed most, and we intend to do just that.""The union's endorsement comes at a time when some factions within organized labor have expressed disappointment with Clinton. The former secretary of state didn't take a clear position on fast-track authorization for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the mammoth trade deal that unions, including IAM, have loudly opposed. But according to IAM, Clinton beat Sanders by a margin of more than 6 to 1 in its poll of 2,000 union members.""The question should not be why are we endorsing Hillary Clinton now, but rather, what took us so long,"" Buffenbarger said."

At least five other police dogs have died in hot cars in the United States this summer. Three-year-old Wix had been on special duty at the PGA Championship in Sheboygan with his partner, Deputy Austin Lemberger, when he was left alone in a squad car with the “engine running and the air conditioning on,” said the Brown County Sheriff's Office in a statement.The air conditioning unit, however, is believed to have malfunctioned. An alarm system that's supposed to sound if the temperature in the car rises to a dangerous level also “failed to activate,” the statement said.Wix, who had been with the Brown County Sheriff's Office since April 2014 and had specialized in explosive detection, was found “unresponsive” by his partner on Wednesday afternoon. It’s unclear how long the dog was left alone in the car.The sheriff’s office said it is investigating the incident.""Wix was a valuable member of this agency and community and will be sadly missed by all. Our thoughts are with Deputy Lemberger while he copes with the loss of his K-9 partner,"" said the agency.According to the Green Bay Press-Gazette, Wix is one of several police dogs to die in a hot car in the United States this summer.Just this week, a Texas sheriff’s deputy was fired after he left his police dog in a patrol car for 20 hours. The dog was found dead on Monday.Two police dogs in Georgia died in July after being left in hot cars. Deaths of police dogs in California and Alabama have also been reported.Temperatures can rise extremely quickly inside vehicles. According to the Humane Society, it is never a good idea to leave a pet in a parked car, even with a window cracked or the air conditioner on. “On an 85-degree day, for example, the temperature inside a car with the windows opened slightly can reach 102 degrees within 10 minutes,” the organization writes.However, according to the Press-Gazette, police dogs are “routinely left inside squad cars if they’re on duty but not working.”“[Officers] don’t have the luxury of tying a patrol dog to the tree when they rest ... They are so well-trained that when they come out of the car they’re on high alert,” Margaret Eastman, a veterinarian from Bay East Animal Hospital in Green Bay, told the news outlet.“Utilizing the vehicle as a place of rest is necessary,” she said.For more information on keeping your pets safe in hot weather, visit the Humane Society's website.

The three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit panel -- two appointed by Obama and one by then-President George W. Bush -- unanimously upheld a lower court's decision to dismiss the case.The point of the proceeding was simply to establish whether the Maricopa County sheriff could even bring his lawsuit, not to decide the issues he raised. Arpaio argued that Obama's policies suspending deportation for certain undocumented immigrants cause him and his county ""harm"" by driving up the number of unauthorized immigrants and thereby increasing crime, leading to more people in the local jail. He and his lawyer, Larry Klayman, claimed that this had already happened after the president began the 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which Arpaio was seeking to stop along with a newer deportation reprieve program for parents.The judges weren't convinced. Writing for the court, Judge Nina Pillard held that Arpaio had ""failed to allege an injury that is both fairly traceable to the deferred action policies and redressable by enjoining them."" She called his claim that deferred deportations would lead to more crime in Maricopa County ""unduly speculative.""""Projected increases he anticipates in the county's policing burden and jail population rest on chains of supposition and contradict acknowledged realities,"" Pillard wrote.Arpaio's lawsuit targeted the older DACA program and a new corresponding policy for parents, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). The latter, along with an expansion of DACA, is currently blocked from going into effect under a different lawsuit brought by 26 states, which contends that Obama's actions were unconstitutional.The states' case, known as Texas v. U.S., has proved more successful than Arpaio's so far. A federal judge issued a preliminary injunction in February against DAPA and the expansion of DACA, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit is currently considering whether to allow that injunction to stand. Although the D.C. Circuit decision was unanimous against Arpaio, the one judge who had been appointed by Bush wrote separately to observe that the ruling should not be interpreted as an endorsement of the constitutionality of Obama's actions.""The Sheriff's claims on the merits may well raise a constitutionally cogent point,"" Judge Janice Rogers Brown wrote, according to Politico. She said the DACA and DAPA programs might ""arguably cross[] the line between implementing the law and making it.""Immigrant rights groups said the D.C. Circuit ruling was another step toward showing that the president's programs are constitutional and would benefit millions of people. Marielena Hincapié, executive director of the National Immigration Law Center, called the lawsuit ""a baseless attack, on behalf of the country's most anti-immigrant sheriff.""""Let this be another reminder to Sheriff Arpaio and his allies that they are standing on the wrong side of the law, public opinion, and history,"" Hincapié said in a statement. ""This is just the latest decision following a long line of legal precedent and showing that the decisions in the Texas v. U.S. case have so far been outliers.""

I'm blessed with a great family, but my record of success is something people yearn for in Washington, D.C.""While Bush's entire political career has taken place in Florida, he has used his family connections to further himself and to raise money for his presidential campaign.Later in the day, Bush also downplayed his connections to his brother and his father when he was asked why he was receiving advice from Paul Wolfowitz, an architect of the Iraq War, who served in the administrations of both Bush presidents.""Paul Wolfowitz is providing some advice. I get most of my advice from a team that we have in Miami, Florida -- young people that are gonna be either not assigned or they have experience either in Congress or in the previous administration.""Still, Bush said he faces a unique challenge in distinguishing himself from the administrations of his father and brother.""The parlor game that's played where you know you have 35 or 40 people that are helping you with foreign policy and if they have any executive experience, they've had to do with two Republican administrations,"" Bush said. ""Who were the people who were presidents -- the last two Republicans?

I’m the first candidate to have a view on this with enough detail for people to see what the world would look like if I’m president. It doesn’t change my views,"" Bush said."
19,POLITICS,Feds Now Pushing States Toward Medical Treatment For Heroin Addicts,Jason Cherkis and Ryan Grim,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/heroin-addiction-treatment_us_55cd1855e4b055a6daafe67f,Some federal grants will even require rehab centers to offer it.,2015-08-14,"<p>Drug czar Michael Botticelli has described the use of medication-assisted treatment, combined with behavioral supports, as ""the standard of care for the treatment of opiate addiction.""</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_0_267_4256_2549%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- For the first time, the federal agency responsible for most public funding of drug addiction treatment has added language to its grant applications designed to push the treatment industry away from the abstinence model.Treatment for substance abuse disorders in the United States widely follows this model, which rests on the belief that abstaining from all drugs, including medications prescribed specifically for addiction, is the only acceptable route to recovery.The new grant language from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration encourages states to reject the status quo and to require the option of medication-assisted treatment in clinical settings.The new language appears in SAMHSA's block grant application for fiscal years 2016-2017. The money available through these block grants is substantial; in fiscal year 2015, the agency had $1.8 billion to award. So while some treatment providers vehemently disagree with the federal recommendation, the suggestion will carry weight.Among the medical establishment, medication-assisted treatment -- such as providing methadone or buprenorphine (which goes by the brand name Suboxone) -- is widely viewed as the standard of care for treating heroin and other opioid addicts. But the vast majority of rehabilitation facilities in the U.S. do not offer such care.The block grant application now states:There is a voluminous literature on the efficacy of [Food and Drug Administration]-approved medications for the treatment of substance use disorders. However, many treatment programs in the U.S. offer only abstinence-based treatment for these conditions. SAMHSA strongly encourages the states to require that treatment facilities providing clinical care to those with substance use disorders be required to either have the capacity and staff expertise to use MAT or have collaborative relationships with other providers such that these MATs can be accessed as clinically indicated for patient need. Individuals with substance use disorders who have a disorder for which there is an FDA-approved medication treatment should have access to those treatments based upon each individual patient's needs.As the opioid epidemic has spiked -- the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported that heroin-related overdose deaths almost quadrupled between 2002 and 2013 -- the inadequacy of the U.S. treatment system has become all the more apparent. In January, The Huffington Post published an investigation that looked at the abstinence model's failure and how it led to more overdose deaths. Shortly thereafter, federal drug czar Michael Botticelli said that the U.S. government would make drug court funding conditional on states being guided by the science on treatment, rather than ideology. He added that SAMHSA would be taking a similar approach, but needed to work through the details first.""As the Huffington Post article pointed out, we have highly effective medications, when combined with other behavioral supports, that are the standard of care for the treatment of opiate addiction. And for a long time and what continues to this day is a lack of -- a tremendous amount of misunderstanding about these drugs and particularly within our criminal justice system,"" Botticelli said in February.Anne Herron, director of the Division of Regional and National Policy for SAMHSA, recently told HuffPost that state policymakers offered positive feedback when a draft of the new grant language was introduced. But she added it’s still up to the states to spend the federal block grants how they see fit -- and that may not include funding for treatments like methadone or increasing access to Suboxone.""We do encourage that they make available the full continuum,"" Herron said.For some of its discretionary grants, Herron added, SAMHSA has started to include slightly different language that would actually tie federal funding to providing medication-assisted treatment access. ""It's important to us to acknowledge that there are a variety of treatment options that provide great outcomes,"" she said.Dr. Andrew Kolodny, the chief medical director for Phoenix House, a nonprofit rehab organization, is encouraged by the shift in federal policy.""I don't think an addiction treatment program should be state-licensed if it's unable or unwilling to make buprenorphine available to opioid-addicted patients that need it,"" Kolodny said. ""This move by SAMHSA helps move us in that direction."""

""What we need to do is reform Social Security to preserve it and protect it for those that already have it and reform it in the logical ways where there's broad bipartisan consensus, which is to, over an extended period of time, raise the retirement age and raise the income cap limit.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, has pounced on him. The former Florida governor has also expressed an openness to ""means-testing,"" which would reduce benefits for high-income seniors.Critics say such an approach would lead to poor retirement planning and discourage people from working past the age when they are eligible for benefits.In June, Bush said his brother had failed at reforming Social Security and that the next president would have to ""try again,"" though it was unclear what exactly he meant by that.Also on HuffPost:"
