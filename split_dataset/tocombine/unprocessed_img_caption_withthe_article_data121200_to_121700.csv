But NFL running back Derrick Ward had a problem with the way Sam reacted after he was selected by the St. Louis Rams in the seventh round. An emotional Sam, who became the first openly gay player to be drafted into the NFL in the NFL, celebrated with family and kissed his boyfriend after the memorable phone call from Rams coach Jeff Fisher. He also playfully smeared a piece of cake on his boyfriend's face.Ward thought the kiss -- and the cake -- crossed the line. The 33-year-old, who last played in the NFL with the Houston Texans in 2011, delivered a long rant on Twitter, ripping Sam for his actions and ESPN for broadcasting them. Ward insisted that Sam's sexuality wasn't the issue; he claimed he would have been bothered if he had kissed a woman instead. Everyone who comments on my page saying what dude did was fine is getting blocked. So far I've blocked 10 peopleCORRECTION: A previous version of this story incorrectly stated the Derrick Ward position and his status in the NFL.  "

Neither Congress nor the White House want to raise the taxes, which amount to 18.4 cents per gallon tax on gas and 24.4 cents per gallon on diesel.Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx proposed a four-year, $302 billion package paid for by ending certain tax breaks for businesses, but reaction has been cool.

Saturday at a GOP event in the congressman's home district. Republicans in Virginia's 7th District gathered Saturday at a convention to elect a new committee chairman for the district. According to vote totals by conservative blog The Bold Elephant, incumbent chairman and key Cantor ally Linwood Cobb narrowly lost his reelection bid to tea party-backed Fred Gruber. Tea party activists touted Gruber's victory as a bellwether of the showdown between Cantor and his primary rival, Dave Brat. An economics professor at Randolph-Macon College, Brat is challenging Cantor from the right, picking up endorsements from a number of conservative groups. As Politico reported last month, Cantor's camp has taken the challenge seriously despite Brat's slim chance of victory.Speaking at Saturday's event, Cantor called Brat out over ""inaccuracies"" in his campaigning. The Washington Post reports: Any sign that Cantor’s support has slipped among the region’s most active Republicans could spell a tougher challenge during next month’s election. And some of the crowd’s reaction Saturday when Cantor took a shot at Brat made clear that the Republican majority leader has not yet fully shored up support.Former lieutenant governor Bill Bolling (R), who left the 2013 Virginia governor's race as tea party favorite Ken Cuccinelli's candidacy picked up momentum, said he was ""extremely disappointed"" in Cobb's defeat as chairman.“Clearly, there is a battle taking place for the heart and soul of the Republican Party,” he said in a statement, according to the Post.Virginia's primary will be held June 10.

4,PARENTS,5 Things My Mother Taught Me About Perfection,"N'tima Preusser, ContributorMilitary wife and new mother",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/things-my-mother-taught-me-about-perfection_b_5298376.html,"Without the confidence she exemplified, I would not have learned the significance of loving myself, and in turn, teaching my daughter to love herself, too. Through my mom, I learned loving yourself is the beginning of all victories.",2014-05-11,2014-05-09-335391_10150380510797401_1010809034_o.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-05-09-335391_10150380510797401_1010809034_o-thumb.jpg,"If you know my mother, you know full well how eccentric she is. Or in other words, nutty. She's energetic and quirky. She's chatty and long winded. She is sarcastic. She is messy. She is cantankerous.If you know my mom, you know her ability to drive one a bit mad.If you really, truly know my mom, you know there isn't another person more wonderful than she is. I could spend my whole life writing, and never be able to properly represent her heart. She is as generous as they come. Her entire existence is centralized on serving others. She is passionate about simple things (the color purple, PT Cruisers, Michael Jackson... to name a few). She is the reason for nearly all that I am, and in motherhood I have seen her in myself even more. Narrowing down all that she's taught me is an impossible task, but here are the pieces she illustrated in her parenting that I hope to carry on in my own home. 1. Take care of yourself.Growing up, my mom would take ""vacations to Hawaii"" on a weekly basis. My dad and us kids knew this meant my mom would take a nap or a ""time-out"" in her room for about an hour to recuperate. This allowed her to address her needs as an individual in a way that wasn't harmful or neglectful for us kids. This was her way of assuring that she was able to be her best self for us. These days, I find myself taking my own kind of ""trips to Hawaii"" on occasion. Usually on mornings when Steven can wake up with our daughter and I get to sleep awhile longer and to wake up slow. I can see, first-hand, the importance of acknowledging my needs, so I can be there thoroughly for my children too.2. Love your children as they are. Love yourself for who you are, without reserve. My mother treated me and my brothers like we were important. She would emphasize our strengths and never try to water down the spirits we were born with. Your son wants to take tap dancing lessons? Dance your heart out, kid! Your other son likes playing dress up with his sister, complete with eyeshadow and lipstick? Pucker up! Your daughter wants to be a percussionist or join a swim team, only to quit within a few weeks. After money was spent on a snare drum and swim lessons. Well, she tried. And you are proud for that. When your children are desperately searching to find who they are and want to dye their hair a rainbow of colors, you don't sweat it. ""It's just hair,"" she would always say. She would tell us that we were smart, funny, beautiful, strong, IMPORTANT before the world noticed we were. Even if we weren't  those things, we were always important.Even when the ""spirits we were born with"" led us down paths that she didn't dream for us, she loved us anyway. Despite her conservative demeanor, and our judgmental surroundings at times, she never tried to change who we were. She always knew that her worth as a parent was not determined by her children's failures, or successes.She lived this truth, too.I do not remember a time in my life when my mother, a woman who struggled with obesity the majority of my childhood, talked badly about herself or her body. In fact, I remember more often my mom expressing ""how good"" she looked, and how good she felt. As a child, I never believed my mom to be ""fat"" because she never let that word fall on our ears. Even if she felt it inside. She taught us how to laugh at ourselves. As children, it was detrimental to our hearts to have such an example of confidence. In a world that teaches us to be ashamed of self-love, that tarnishes our idea of what matters in a human... well, her confidence was everything. Without the confidence she exemplified, I would not have learned the significance of loving myself, and in turn, teaching my daughter to love herself, too. Through my mom, I learned loving yourself is the beginning of all victories.3. Communicate. My mom talked to us. She answered our ""whys?"". She listened to our childlike wonder and curiosity. She taught us about our bodies. She taught us about death. She explained her decisions to us. She communicated her love by giving us her time. Even when our hearts were broken and the last thing we wanted to do was ""talk about it,"" she would communicate through different ways. She would sit with us while we sobbed. Rub our backs and hold us while we soaked her in tears, without needing to know details. She wasn't too big to tell us she didn't have an answer for us, or too big to say sorry when she was wrong. She never dismissed us. Although we fought, respect was a two way street in our house.4. No work is more influential than work done in the home. My mother is a working woman. She is so by default. She was raised by a dairy man, and spent her childhood milking cows and tending to the farm early in the morning and late into the night. She has continued working through her marriage. Managing businesses. Working full time. Going to school full time. Working from home, working away from home. My mother is educated, and persevering, and busy. She always taught us to work hard.However, my mother has always stressed that raising her children was the most monumental, fulfilling type of work. And when she was home with us, she was present. She knew full well, as I do now, that your children's childhood is fleeting. No worldly success, no degree, no title, no amount of monetary value would ever be as rewarding as the love she felt from, and the time she spent with her children.5. Be real with sorrow.My mother never tried to shelter us from her struggle. She never tried to lessen the reality of her pain for us.In 1995, while she was away on a business trip with her two younger children, me included, my oldest brother was in an accident with a lawn mower that ended up taking a third of his heel. He was told he'd never walk again, and had to endure several excruciating surgeries to repair the damage. My mother was devastated. Stricken with guilt, she would lie in bed and cry with my brother through painful bandage changes. She gave up a large part of her life to help him recover, to teach him to walk again, and to overcome the trauma of that accident, both physically and mentally. She healed right alongside my brother.In 1997, she was in a car accident during a rainstorm that sent her car spiraling on the freeway and rolling down a hill. Miraculously, my brother and her survived, but she was not afraid to show us kids the aftermath. The mini van was now a heap of crushed metal. Her body was covered in dark black bruises, scars, and seat belt burns as a result. She showed us the proof of her survival in her battered and beaten body.In 1998, my mother became pregnant with her fifth child, a little boy that was to be named Nicholas. Suddenly, and unexpectedly, at around 7 months along, my mother found out that his heart was no longer beating. Not many can relate to this sort of pain. I won't pretend that I can, but I watched my mother, devoured in agony as she carried this little baby for a few months longer; and delivered his lifeless, perfect little body at home. We were well aware of his existence, and his passing. Each of us kids were allowed to hold him, and I remember his violet tinted skin and the dimple in his chin, (much like mine and my mother's, my brother's, my grandfather's, and my own little girl's). My mom didn't hide my brother from us, instead we witnessed her anguish as she was forced to bury one of her babies.Through each of these unimaginable circumstances, and dozens more throughout her life, we were able to see my mother overcome life's inevitable despair.She taught us that life will not cater to us. She taught us we are not entitled to ease. She taught us to be optimistic. She taught us to forgive life's blows, to become better.She taught us that she was human.My mom is an incredibly flawed human being. Her house was almost always unkempt. Her children weren't dressed in trendy clothing, nor were they always well behaved, or excelling academically. She is heavily reliant on the grace of God.However, she surely gave her children a genuinely happy life, and that alone makes her The Perfect Mother.This post is part of HuffPost Parents' Mother's Day series, exploring the lessons our moms taught us about parenting.

Members of civil society groups marched through the streets of Abuja and to the Nigerian defence headquarters to meet with military chiefs, to press for the release of more than 200 Chibok school girls abducted three weeks ago. Suspected Boko Haram Islamists have kidnapped eight more girls from Nigeria's embattled northeast, residents said on May 6, after the extremist group's leader claimed responsibility for abducting more than 200 schoolgirls last month and said in a video he was holding them as 'slaves' and threatened to 'sell them in the market'. AFP PHOTO/PIUS UTOMI EKPEI / AFP / PIUS UTOMI EKPEI (Photo credit should read PIUS UTOMI EKPEI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc135ff2300005000d0ad6f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It took three weeks for President Obama to publicly address the crisis of over 250 Nigerian schoolgirls kidnapped on April 14 and to pledge to send modest support. That is 22 days of unfathomable cruelty to vulnerable girls. It's 22 days of panicked parents wondering the fate of their daughters and why the international community has not vocally condemned the treacherous act.That the U.S. and other nations are stepping forward with offers of assistance is welcome; but the fact that such action came after more than three weeks, and only in response to great pressure and international outrage, raises a fundamental question: what, morally, does the U.S. stand for? It is naïve to ignore the mounting evidence that, beyond considering its own strategic and national self-interest, the U.S. does not have an operating philosophy when it comes to defending human rights. Its decision to remain silent after Egypt's democratically elected president was overthrown in a coup last year, and its long standing engagement with countries with poor human rights records, such as Saudi Arabia, underscores the schism between what America claims to stand for and what it actually does in practice.America in practice is a far cry from America, the moral torchbearer and defender of human rights, of fairness and justice, of what is good and decent. That was the America – America, the brand – that I believed in as a young girl in boarding school in Africa. But it is not the one I recognize today.To be sure, America faces a host of its own economic challenges — an anemic economic recovery in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, widening income inequality, political gridlock, dilapidated infrastructure and significant demographic headwinds with the aging baby boomers. No doubt these seemingly intractable challenges feed into the American temptation to retreat from the international stage. An April 2014 poll found fewer than 20 percent of Americans calling for more active engagement in the world, and about half demanding less.Against such a backdrop, international crises will not easily top an already crowded U.S. policy agenda. Indeed, the message that America will not come to the rescue when injustices occur elsewhere in the world may only now be sinking in along with the message that the U.S. may no longer underwrite such global public goods as policing sea lanes. Doing what is right, simply because it is right, seems no longer the American posture.Yet the U.S. should carefully consider whether a hasty retreat is actually in its interest. Those who believe that events like the school atrocities in Nigeria are not particularly relevant to their future are wrong. Such destabilizing events are by no means isolated or easily contained.Nigeria has an incendiary confluence of characteristics matched only in other volatile places such as the Middle East, Afghanistan and Pakistan: a population skewed to the young, notable commodity dependence, and religious fervor and extremism. But Nigeria is not unique. Already, for 2014, the Economic Intelligence Unit has identified 65 countries that face a high risk of social unrest, the highest measurement of its kind in more than a decade. And the Overseas Development Institute projects that by 2025, the vast majority of the world's poor will be living in fragile, mainly low-income and African states. The slow and slowing economic growth prospects of the broader emerging world, home to 85 percent of the world's population and a disproportionately high number of people under the age of 25 years old, will only lead to a more tumultuous and dangerous world.This is not a world in which America can thrive. Nor is it a world that America, the largest economy in the world and ostensibly leader of the free world, can safely ignore. Even if morality had not been sufficient to mobilize the U.S. to action in Nigeria sooner, surely economic political, and security considerations should have been. After all, Nigeria is Africa’s largest economy by GDP, and it is one of the ten largest oil exporters to the U.S. In the interest of economic development, children’s access to education must be protected. Moreover, the fact that Boko Haram, the terrorist group that has proudly claimed responsibility for the abductions, is affiliated with al Qaeda should have raised serious security concerns for the U.S.And if the U.S. has been so slow to respond to or even acknowledge Nigeria’s crisis, what hope do smaller, less relevant countries have — countries without the oil, minerals or strategic importance?Americans should think about this question, care about this question and act upon this question. If not, they should be surprised when trouble ripples — or rips — through the world, affecting even the country that thought it could stand safely on the sidelines."

That led to the ruble falling to an all-time low and Russian stocks tumbling.""The malaise of the Russian economy and the current crisis has had its effect on them all,"" said Beresford.Ukrainian-American Len Blavatnik, who owns international record label Warner Music, and Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea soccer club, together lost nearly 1.8 billion pounds in the last twelve months.Western countries have responded to Russia's annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region by imposing limited sanctions against Moscow, targeting some Russian political and business leaders and interests seen as involved in the Ukraine crisis.LONDON CALLINGThe majority of billionaires on the Sunday Times' list were born abroad, reflecting the draw of London, in particular, to elite international investors.Soaring property values in London, where many of Britain's richest people invested as prices bottomed out during the recession, helped boost the overall wealth of the elite group, which surpassed 100 entries for the first time, according to the report's author.Beresford said defining 'Britishness' was one of the hardest tasks and the list included people with strong business interests in Britain and who spent ""quite a lot of their time"" in the country.In a sign that the top of British society is benefiting from the economic recovery, the level of wealth required to enter the top 50 on the list, 1.7 billion pounds, beat the pre-recession 2008 figure for the first time.1 3 Sri and Gopi Hinduja £11.9bn + £1.3bn2 1 Alisher Usmanov £10.65bn - £2.65bn3 4 Lakshmi Mittal and family £10.25bn + £250m4 2 Len Blavatnik £10bn - £1bn5 9 Ernesto and Kirsty £9.75bn + £2.35bnBertarelli6 6 John Fredriksen and family £9.25bn + £450m7 7 David and Simon Reuben £9bn + £719m8 12 Kirsten and Jorn Rausing £8.8bn + £3.691bn9 5 Roman Abramovich £8.52bn - £780m10 8 The Duke of Westminster £8.5bn + £700m11 11 Galen, Hilary and George £7.3bn + £650mWeston and family12 10 Charlene de £6.365bn - £635mCarvalho-Heineken andMichel de Carvalho13 15 Mohamed Bin Issa Al Jaber £6.16bn + £1.645bnand family14 new Carrie and Francois £6.14bn newPerrodo and family15 new German Khan £6.08bn new16 31 Sir David and Sir £6bn + £3.65bnFrederick Barclay17 13 Hans Rausing and family £5.9bn + £1.18bn18 17 Nicky Oppenheimer and £4.57bn + £785mfamily19 18 Earl Cadogan and family £4.2bn + £525m20 14 Joseph Lau and family £4.03bn - £570m21 16 Sir Philip and Lady Green £3.88bn No change22 20 Denis O'Brien £3.854bn + £486m23 32= Mike Ashley £3.75bn + £1.45bn24 19 Sir Richard Branson and £3.6bn + £86mfamily25 new Idan Ofer £3.4bn new($1 = 0.5938 British Pounds)(Reporting By Costas Pitas; Editing by Sophie Hares) "

Since 2006, the national assembly has been trying to update a 1975 Family Code that makes no mention of the rights of transsexuals, gays or lesbians. Meanwhile, proposals to recognize same-sex unions have stalled.""My father supports me but he can't decide it all by himself,"" said Mariela Castro, a member of the national assembly and director of the National Center for Sex Education. ""We have to build a consensus, and that's what we're working toward.""Some of those in the parade said they understood why change was slow, grateful that the Cuban public has grown as accepting as it is.""Things are moving at the pace they need to so that people who aren't used to these things can accept them more peacefully,"" said Guido Quiñones, 57, who works in tourism.Others were more bold.""We expect more,"" said Juan Carlos, a transvestite in makeup and rumba dress who marched to the drum beat.

She urged them to use those skills to help those coming after them.Obama also has received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the university.She encouraged the graduates to start small, such as through volunteering as a tutor or by rallying their communities to start a mentor program, but Obama didn't reject the possibility of larger contributions, such as serving on a school board, in Congress or as president.Read the First Lady's full remarks below (via The White House):10:33 A.M. CDT MRS. OBAMA: Oh, my goodness! Good morning! AUDIENCE: Good morning. MRS. OBAMA: I am so happy to be here with you all. I'm proud to be here in the Big Easy. Look at you all! (Applause.) You look good. STUDENT: You do too! MRS. OBAMA: Thank you. (Laughter.) I want to start by thanking Nicole for that very kind introduction and for sharing her story, which is not too unfamiliar to me -- because they told me I couldn't be where I am, too. So I want to thank Nicole. I'm proud of her. Thank you for the selfie; I think that's the first selfie I've done at a commencement. So, Nicole, you're my first. (Laughter.) And of course, I want to thank the Dillard University Choir. Oh, oh, oh! (Applause.) Oh! That's all I can say. It's like you want to start something up in here, right? (Laughter.) It's like, now we got a commencement going on up in here. (Laughter.) That was beautiful, beautiful. Thank you so much. I also want to recognize Senator Mary Landrieu, who is here. Let's give her a hand. (Applause.) She has been a strong supporter of this university. I want to thank the Dillard University Board of Trustees. I want to thank the faculty, the staff, and, of course, your tremendous president, Dr. Walter Kimbrough. (Applause.) Now, my husband has been called a few things over the years, but he has never had the honor of being referred to as the ""Hip Hop President."" (Applause.) I also want to thank all the folks from the University of New Orleans for hosting us here today. And I know they're hosting the folks at Southern University at New Orleans for their commencement later on today as well, so we wish them a wonderful day. And thank you for having us. (Applause.) And of course, I've got to give a big shout-out to all the family members in the crowd, all of the family members -- (applause) -- especially to the mothers, because it is the day before Mother's Day. To all the mothers, Happy Mother's Day. (Applause.) Now, graduates, you all handled your business, right? Just because you were graduating didn't mean you -- come on, now. (Laughter.) Okay, well, if you didn't, you have my permission to get up and go right now, because there is nothing more important -- no, no, don't get up. (Laughter.) Your mothers would kill you if you got up at this moment. (Laughter.) So just stay in your seats, and when this is all over make sure you take care of mom. But in all seriousness, to all the moms out there -- as well as the dads and the grandparents, the uncles, the aunts, the brothers, the sisters, all of you who have helped raise these graduates -- you have seen them through their ups and downs, and you have poured your hearts and souls into these men and women. So today is your day, too, and you should be very proud. You really should. (Applause.) And finally, most of all, I want to congratulate the beautiful and handsome men and women of the Dillard University Class of 2014. Yay! (Applause.) You all have come so far, I know, to make it to this day -- from all those early days when the girls were sneaking out of Williams Hall to go see the boys over at the Duals -- oh yeah, I did my research -- (laughter) -- to all those tests you crammed for, to the plans you're making now for your careers, to go on to graduate school. You all have seen so much. You've witnessed this school's rebirth after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina -- the new buildings that replaced the ones you lost, the classrooms that started filling back up again, the service projects that you all have done to help this community bounce back. And I know along the way that each of you has written your own story of resilience and determination to make it here to this day. For example, as you heard, Nicole was told back in high school that she just wasn't college material. But now she is your class president, and she's headed off to Yale for her graduate degree. So there. (Applause.) That's it. And I know that some of you may come from tough neighborhoods; some of you may have lost your homes during Katrina. Maybe you're like DeShawn Dabney, a graduate who was raised by his grandmother -- (applause) -- maybe -- that's your grandmother, isn't it, DeShawn? (Laughter.) Raised by his grandmother while some of his family members were dealing with issues. Maybe just like him, you've been working part-time jobs since you were a teenager to make your dream of going to college come true. And now, today, you're all here ready to walk across this stage and get that diploma. And no matter what path you took to get here, you all kept your hearts set on this day. You fought through every challenge you encountered, and you earned that degree from this fine university. And in doing so, you are following in the footsteps of all those who came before you, and you have become an indelible part of the history of this school -- a history that, as you all know, stretches back to well before the Civil War, back to 1826, the year a child named Emperor Williams was born. Now, Emperor was born into slavery. But as he grew up, he managed to teach himself to read and write well enough to create a pass that allowed him to come and go around the city without getting hassled. But one day, his master saw the pass and he said, where did you learn to write like that? Now, just imagine the fear Emperor must have felt when he heard that question -- because remember, back then it was illegal for a slave to learn to read or write. So who knows what kind of punishment he may have gotten -- a beating, a whipping, even worse. We don't exactly know what happened on that day, but we do know that when Emperor turned 32, after more than three decades in bondage, he became a free man. He decided to stay in New Orleans, and he went on to become a minister -- even founded a church right here in town. And in 1869, when abolitionists, missionaries, black folks and white folks came together to create a school for freed slaves here in New Orleans, Emperor was one of the original signers of the charter. They decided to name the school New Orleans University, because even though most of the classes would be taught at a high school level or below, oh, their aspirations were much higher than that. And when they laid the cornerstone for that university's first building down on St. Charles Avenue, Emperor got a chance to speak. He said -- and these are his words -- he said, ""For twenty years I was a slave on these streets. It was a penitentiary offense to educate a Negro. I have seen my fellow-servants whipped for trying to learn; but today here I am [am I], speaking where a building is to be erected for the education of the children of my people."" He goes on to say, ""I wonder if this is the world I was born in."" See, in the course of his short lifetime, Emperor saw education go from being a crime for black folks to being a real possibility for his kids and grandkids. So no wonder he was asking whether this was the same world he'd been born into. See, for a man like Emperor, getting an education could open up a whole new world of opportunity. An education meant having real power. It meant you could manage your own money. It meant you couldn't get swindled out of land or possessions when somebody told you to just sign on the dotted line; sometimes even determined whether or not you could vote. So most folks back then saw education as the key to real and lasting freedom. That's why, when New Orleans University and the other African American college in town, Straight University, first opened their doors, one of the biggest problems they faced was too many students. That's right -- too many students. Many of these students barely spoke English; they'd grown up speaking Creole or French. Few had ever seen the inside of a classroom or even been taught their ABCs. But let me tell you, those students were hungry -- you hear me? Hungry. They studied like their lives depended on it. They blazed through their lessons. And that hunger for education lasted for generations in the African American community here in New Orleans. When an arsonist set fire to the school's library in 1877, they built a new one. When those two original schools ran into financial troubles years later, they started making plans to build an even bigger and better university. And in the 1930s, when white folks complained that this new school would mean too many black students on their buses, the folks at the school got the city to add a bus line just for their students, because nothing -- nothing -- was going to stop them from achieving the vision of those early founders. (Applause.) And finally, in May of 1934, they broke ground for this school, Dillard University -- (applause) -- a university that would go on to produce some of the leading thinkers and achievers in our country. And the day the cornerstone was laid for your library, the President of Howard University spoke these words: He said, ""There lies in this Southland today, buried in unmarked graves, many a black genius who would have blessed this city and this section of our country, if [only] his parents could have had before them the Dillard University you are now building."" And in the years since then, through segregation and depression, through threats of violence and the floodwaters of a devastating storm, students like you have come here to study and to learn, and to carry forward those hopes and dreams. And today, I stand before a sea of young geniuses. Oh, yeah. (Applause.) So, graduates, I hope that you understand that this day is not just the culmination of your own dreams, but the realization of the dreams of so many who came before you. And you should be so proud, and so happy, and so excited about your futures. But what you shouldn't be is satisfied. (Applause.) See, because while it is a wonderful thing that all of you are here today, we have to ask ourselves, what about all those geniuses who never get this chance? I'm talking about the young people from right here in New Orleans and across the country who aren't part of a commencement like this one today, kids no different from all of us, kids who never made it out of high school. The fact is that today, the high school graduation rate for black students is improving, but it is still lower than just about any other group in this country. And while college graduation rates have risen for nearly every other demographic, including African American women, the college graduation rate for African American men has flatlined. See, and the thing is, when our young people fall behind like that in school, they fall behind in life. Last year, African Americans were more than twice as likely as whites to be unemployed. They were almost three times as likely to live in poverty. And they were far more likely to end up in prison or be the victims of violent crimes. Now, perhaps when you hear these statistics, you might think to yourself, well, those numbers are terrible, but I'm not part of the problem. And you might be thinking that since you're not one of those statistics, and you're sitting here wearing that nice black robe today, you can go on your way and never look back. But folks like you and me, we can't afford to think like that -- never. See, because we're the lucky ones, and we can never forget that we didn't get where we are today all on our own. We got here today because of so many people who toiled and sweat and bled and died for us -- people like our parents and grandparents and all those who came before them, people who never dreamed of getting a college education themselves but who worked, and saved, and sacrificed so that we could be here today. We owe them. (Applause.) We owe them. And the only way to pay back that debt is by making those same kinds of sacrifices and investments for the next generation. And I know sitting here right now, that task could seem a bit overwhelming. I know it could seem like the deck is stacked way too high against our young people. And the truth is that some of the problems we face -- structural inequality, schools that lag behind, workplace and housing discrimination -- those problems are too big for one person to fix on their own. But that's still no excuse to stand on the sidelines. Because we know that today, education is still the key to real and lasting freedom -- it is still true today. So it is now up to us to cultivate that hunger for education in our own lives and in those around us. And we know that hunger is still out there -- we know it. We see it in students like DeShawn and Nicole and all of you who scraped and clawed so you could make it to this day. We see it in the single moms who work three jobs so their kids might have a shot at earning a degree like yours. (Applause.) We see that hunger all around the world -- in that young woman named Malala who was shot on her school bus in Pakistan just for speaking out in support of girls getting an education, and the more than 200 girls kidnapped from their own school in Nigeria for wanting an education -- (applause) -- young people who are knowingly risking their lives every day just to go to school. And in fact, you've seen that hunger right here at Dillard: your valedictorian, three salutatorians are all from Nigeria. (Applause.) They studied hard at an early age, earned scholarships to come here to this university, achieved 4.0 GPAs. And now they are off pursuing master's degrees, work in software development, teaching math and science to young people here in the United States. See, now, that's the kind of hunger for education that we have to reignite in all of our communities. It's the same hunger that gave life to this university, the same hunger that defined so many of our parents and grandparents -- including my own. You see, my parents never went to college, but they were determined to see me and my brother and all the kids in our neighborhood get a good education. (Applause.) So my mother volunteered at my school -- helping out every day in the front office, making sure our teachers were doing their jobs, holding their feet to the fire if she thought they were falling short. I'd walk by the office and there she'd be. (Laughter.) I'd leave class to go to the bathroom, there she'd be again, roaming the halls, looking in the classrooms. And of course, as a kid, I have to say, that was a bit mortifying, having your mother at school all the time. But looking back, I have no doubt that my classmates and I got a better education because she was looking over those teachers' shoulders. (Applause.) You see, my mom was not a teacher or a principal or a school board member. But when it came to education, she had that hunger. So she believed that our education was very much her business. And we need more people who think and act like my mother, and all those mothers out there, because the education of our young people is all of our business. That's what Emperor Williams thought. That's what the folks here in New Orleans thought as they worked to rebuild this campus after Katrina. And as graduates of Dillard University, that's how we need you to think every single day for the rest of your lives. You all have opportunities and skills and education that so many folks who came before you never could have dreamed of. So just imagine the kind of impact that you're going to make. Imagine how you can inspire those around you to reach higher and complete their own education. And you can start small. Start by volunteering at an after-school program, or helping some high school kids fill out their college applications. Show them the path that you took. Or you can think a little bigger -- you can get your entire congregation or your community to start a mentoring program; maybe convince your new employer to sponsor scholarships for underprivileged kids. Or maybe you could think a little higher -- maybe you could run for school board or Congress, or, yes, even President of the United States. (Applause.) And then maybe you could build preschools for every single one of our kids. Maybe you could help turn that pipeline to prison into a highway to college; help give every child in America an education that is truly worth of their promise. Those are the kind of big dreams that folks who founded this university reached for. That is how high they set their bar. And so we owe it to those folks -- the folks who had the audacity to call their little schools ""universities"" and name their baby boys ""Emperor"" -- we owe it to them to reach as high as they did, and to bring others along the way. As the history of this school has taught us, no dream is too big, no vision is too bold; as long as we stay hungry for education and let that hunger be our North Star, there is nothing, graduates, nothing that we cannot achieve. So, graduates, that is your mission. This is your obligation. I want you to keep reaching higher. I want you all to keep raising your bars. Let the next generation know that there is no greater investment than a good education. And if you do all of this, then I am confident that you will uphold that duty and write your own chapter into the legacy of this great university. And let me tell you something, I cannot wait to see the world that your children will be born into. Congratulations. I love you all. I am honored to be here. I am proud of you. God bless you. And thank your families. (Applause.) END 10:56 A.M. CDT"

Wikipedia.US power utilities investment in solar boomed once again in 2013, and renewable clean energy, much of it solar, accounted for 80% of newly installed power capacity in the US from October 2013 through March 2014. In New York, the solar industry got a $1 billion boost; Hawaii's largest utility was ordered to help customers install more rooftop solar. Solar jobs are growing 10 times faster than the national average of other sectors, while federal solar initiatives have resulted in the cost of solar installation decreasing solidly since 2011. New technological advances continue to make solar rooftop installation safer and faster; a Spanish solar plant has demonstrated the ability to supply power day and night, thanks to a new award-winning design that uses molten salts for storing energy until needed.   Around the world, nonprofits are bringing solar power to developing countries, improving health care, education and agriculture. More and more islands are adopting solar power, with one making it their only source of power.

Oceanic acidification is starting to dissolve shells of key seafood species, and important parts of the marine food chain. Global Disruptions of Water Cycles: Besides playing a part in the catastrophic Florida rainfall, climate change is making extreme rain events more likely in England. In Canada, changing water patterns are decreasing the quality of drinking water supplies. The Indian monsoon is becoming more erratic, and more extreme typhoons like Haiyan are predicted under climate change. Recent deadly floods in Afghanistan were worsened by preceding years of drought, while further avalanches on Mt Everest have worsened the outlook for the current climbing season.

14,IMPACT,Homeless Say These Tiny Houses Are 'Life Changing',,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/tiny-homes-homeless_n_5300716.html,,2014-05-10,"In this Jan. 16, 2014 photo Betty Ybarra, 48, stands outside a tiny houses she and her boyfriend live in, in Madison, Wis. It is the first house built by OM Build, which wants to build nine houses in Madison for the homeless. (AP Photo/Carrie Antlfinger)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1c2e63c000066000bea2e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Brendan O'BrienMADISON, Wis., May 10 (Reuters) - After surviving two long, cold Wisconsin winters on the streets, Betty Ybarra traded freezing park benches and tents for a tiny house made of recycled wood she helped build herself.Her 99-square-foot home, which boasts flower window boxes, was built by volunteers of the Occupy Madison group, as part of about a half dozen similar projects around the United States, including in New York and Texas, to shelter the homeless.""We can check on our flowers and we can now try to live a normal life,"" said Ybarra, 49, who shares her new home with her friend Chris Derrick, 55, who had also been homeless.Madison, Wisconsin's capital and a city of 250,000, regularly makes national lists of best places to live, but its homeless population increased by 7 percent over the last four years to about 3,370.   In this Jan. 16, 2014 photo, Harold ""Hap"" Morgan works in the OM Build workshop in Madison, Wis. He is in line to get one of the nine houses planned to be built by the group to help those without permanent homes.  The Madison village plan was born two years ago in a ""put up or shut up moment"" when the Occupy Madison demonstrations against economic inequality ended, and as similar efforts started in other parts of the country.In Newfield, New York, organizers plan 14 to 18 tiny houses on private land with private donations. In Austin, Texas, the plan is to build a village of tiny houses and small shelters for 200 people on 27 acres.The Madison plan might be narrower in scope, with nine tiny homes planned so far, but organizers say a retail store and gardens on the site of a former auto repair shop will bring a sense of safety and community.""The village will bring dignity. We will have a fence and we will have community,"" organizer Trina Clemente said.The house Ybarra and Derrick moved into on Christmas Eve was the first and volunteers are finishing two more. All have a sink and a composting toilet, and are heated using propane and solar panels.""It means shelter and security. Living in a tiny house is life changing,"" said Ybarra, who explained she ended up on the streets after fleeing an abusive relationship.The interior is just big enough for a full bed, a half-circle table against a wall, microwave and shelf. Wooden plaques Ybarra painted with the words ""Peace,"" Love"" and ""Occupy"" decorate the walls.   This Jan. 16, 2014 photo shows the inside of a tiny house that was built by OM Build in Madison, Wis. They want to built nine altogether and allow the homeless to live in them.  ""We built this with our hands, our hearts and our friends,"" Derrick said, standing on the small triangular front porch of his abode enjoying a cup of coffee.Steve Berg at the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said tiny house projects such as the one in Madison might be an effective way to shelter the homeless, who deal with addiction and mental illness, if they have access to services and support.""The essential element is a stable residence and any kind of a network of supports,"" said Berg, vice president for programs and policy for the organization.Much of the homelessness in the United States is caused by economic crises and can be addressed by short-term financial and housing assistance, Berg said.The Madison group has received more than $85,000 in donations, partly through crowd-sourcing for the houses, which cost $5,000 each in materials. It hopes eventually to build a village of 30 tiny houses.""Sky's the limit. The real issue here is that it is changing people's lives and giving people self-worth,"" organizer Brenda Konkel said.For Ybarra a tiny house means much-needed normalcy after many nights sleeping on cardboard.""It's cozy,"" she added.

Preparations were in full swing on Saturday for the disputed referendums in the two eastern regions of Donetsk and Lugansk, home to 7.3 million of Ukraine's total population of 46 million. Voters in Sunday's referendums will be asked if they support the creation of two independent republics that many see as a prelude to joining Russia, as happened in Crimea.

But, in reference to fighters who have seized police and government buildings, he said ""terrorists"" could not be included.The vote, organised on a largely ad hoc basis with no clear control of authenticity of ballot papers or voter lists, could have serious consequences for Ukraine and relations between Moscow and the West. It risks turning isolated clashes into civil war.""(Secession from Ukraine)...would be a step into the abyss for these regions,"" Turchinov said on his website. ""Those who stand for self-rule do not understand that it would mean complete destruction of the economy, social programmes and life in general for the majority of the population in these regions.""The atmosphere in major cities across the region was tense though there were no reports of fighting in the morning.In the port city of Mariupol, where between seven and 20 people were killed in fierce fighting on Friday, rebels blocked the streets with barricades of tyres, garbage containers and chairs. Smoke was still coming from the partially burnt-out administration building. There was no sign of Ukrainian forces.The barricades were manned by a handful of pro-Russians, some with batons or clubs, wearing motorcycle helmets. No gunmen were visible. Video on the YouTube site showed an armoured car captured by rebels set on fire and ammunition exploding.Throughout the city of Slaviansk, the most heavily defended separatist redoubt, streets were barricaded with tyres, furniture, cars and scrap iron.In the city of Donetsk, rebels released several members of the Red Cross whom they held for seven hours, one having been beaten, a Red Cross official in Kiev said. WESTERN SANCTIONSWestern states prepared to step up pressure on Russia, whom they accuse of engineering the crisis to destabilise Ukraine. Russia denies involvement but voices support for insurgents it says are defending themselves against fascist Ukrainian forces.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande said that if May 25 national polls failed to go ahead because of the rebellion, this would further unsettle the country. In that case, they would be ""ready to take further sanctions against Russia"".Western countries are expected to announce new economic sanctions over President Vladimir Putin's actions over Ukraine.The European Union has so far imposed asset freezes and visa bans on 48 Russians and Ukrainians over Moscow's annexation of Crimea. EU diplomats say new sanctions will for the first time target companies.The national polls are seen in Kiev as a way of establishing a fully legitimate, universally elected government following pro-Kremlin president Viktor Yanukovich's flight to Russia in February under pressure from pro-Western demonstrations.In the largely rebel-controlled regions of Donetsk and Lugansk, which have declared a breakaway ""People's Republic of Donetsk"", preparations went ahead for Sunday's self-rule referendum, though there was widespread uncertainty about what the question on the ballot paper meant:""Do you support the act of self-rule of the People's Republic of Donetsk?""Some people interpret it as a vote for more local powers, some for broad autonomy within Ukraine, some for independence, others still as a step towards incorporation into Russia.Vyacheslav Ponomaryov, the rebel mayor of the city of Slaviansk said he expected a 100 percent turnout. He set out conditions for talks with Kiev.""The withdrawal of (Ukrainian) forces and exchange of prisoners,"" he told a news conference. ""Only after fulfilment of these conditions would we be ready for talks.

You are the bedrock, the lynchpin, the gluey Mom-particle slathered across the construction paper of my reality. When my shoelaces needed tying, who bent down and tied them? You did. When my boo-boos needed bandaging last week, who was there to wipe away the tears and apply immediate, life saving first-aid? You were, that's who.

19,FIFTY,10 Lessons We Learned From Diane Keaton's New Book,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/diane-keaton-book-_n_5267744.html,,2014-05-10,"NEW YORK - APRIL 09: Actress Diane Keaton poses for a photo at the Film Society of Lincoln Center's Annual Gala Tribute to honor actress Diane Keaton at Avery Fisher Hall on April 9, 2007 in New York City. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb669eb240000500056c0e9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SPECIAL FROM Next AvenueBy Donna SapolinTwo nights ago, I went to New York’s 92Y to hear Diane Keaton, one of the country’s most acclaimed and beloved actresses, read from her new book, ""Let’s Just Say It Wasn’t Pretty.""  The book, as disarming and personable as the actress herself, casts light on her insights into beauty, parenting, growing older and doing things your own way. The latter is something Keaton, 68, knows something about — after all, she’s an iconoclastic style icon whose roles and costumes, both on and off the screen, helped boomers embrace imperfection and fly in the face of societal conventions.  Clad in a wide-brimmed hat, leopard booties and a belted camel overcoat, Keaton regaled the audience with blunt, funny and poetic stories about her relationships with Hollywood’s leading men, her ‘cut-and-paste’ approach to fashion, the deeper meaning of senior train tickets and the magnificent beauty of chance encounters and friendship.  Through an often self-deprecating lens, Keaton delivered a wry commentary on how perspectives shift with time’s passage.  After attending her talk, I read her book and boiled down its core messages into the following 10 points and quotes. I hope they inspire you to read ""Let’s Just Say It Wasn’t Pretty"" in full; it captures the Keaton we’ve come to know and love in all her rambling, insecure and inspiring glory.1. Your eyes are the best part of your body. “I’ve learned to see beauty where I never saw it before. But only because my expectations are more realistic. My favorite part of my body is my eyes. Not because of their color … but because of what they see. When I was in my twenties and thirties I wanted my appearance to be more interesting than the beauty that surrounded me. It was a fool’s folly.”  2. Don’t be afraid to defy expectations. Don’t try to appeal to everyone. “I respect women who aren’t afraid to push the envelope, women who are inappropriate, women who do what you aren’t supposed to.”3. The nature of true beauty is deep and mysterious. “I knew this because on the cliffs of Laguna Beach I cried from the sheer wonder of what I saw. Beautiful makes you come back for more. It makes you ask questions. It’s vast, unknowable and magnificent. That’s part of its power. It makes you think about the experience it’s giving you. That’s when I knew what I wanted. I’ve been chasing it ever since.”  4. Your brand of imperfection can be your most powerful asset. “I’m talking about finding whatever works for you to get out the door every day, I’m talking about the flaws that eventually take on a life of their own. The ineptness that makes you who you are. I’m talking about women who make us see beauty where we never saw it; women who turn wrong into right.”  5. Bravery is a kind of beauty. “As a girl I didn’t think about Gary Cooper’s looks, or the difference between Grace Kelly’s age and his. I didn’t care. Would he ever see her again [in the movie High Noon]? Would he die? Did he have to be so brave? I remember their goodbye. I remember Tex Ritter singing “Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darlin’.” I remember crying. Looks weren’t the issue. Courage was. I didn’t know that courage was a form of beauty, but I must have felt it.”   6. The best and most authentic thing about a face is its ability to express feelings. “With one mouth, one set of lips, one chin and lots of skin that’s still a working vital organ, I’m not complaining. I know from experience how lucky I am. But the most thrilling aspect of my face is its ability to express feelings. All of my feelings and all my emotion come out on my face ... You see, my face identifies who I am inside. It shows feelings I can’t put into words. And that is a miracle, an extraordinarily ordinary miracle, one I’ll think twice about before I change.""  7. Wear whatever feels right; invent what’s missing. “As for shopping? Think Big. Think Small. Think Different. Beauty Outside. Beast Inside. American by Birth. Rebel by Choice. Make the Most of Now. Because You’re Worth It. When the World Zigs, Zag. Decry Complacency. Think Outside the Bun. Have It Your Way. Just Do It. If You’ve Got It, Flaunt It. Does She Or Doesn’t She? The United Colors of Benetton. We’re not liberal America or conservative America — we’re part of the United States of America. You’re you. I’m me.”  8. Beauty is whatever you think it is. “So what is beauty? For me, it’s a collection of images, and objects, and thoughts, and feelings I’ve gathered over the course of my life. Dad would have numbered beauty. Mom wrote it down. Dexter [Keaton’s daughter] listens to it. Duke [Keaton’s son] wants to own it, all of it, in every shape and form. Sometimes beauty, like today, is a closed book I can’t open. Sometimes it’s hanging in my closet. Like my dad’s old sweaters. Sometimes it’s a message saved on my voicemail … But one thing for sure: all of it is personal….""  9. Learn to take compliments. “I haven’t, but you should. Compliments linger. Someone once compared my legs to Lucille Ball’s great gams. Like I cared. She was old. Now it’s my turn to be old. If someone said the same thing to me today, I’d be overjoyed.”  10. Focus on the gold that matters. “It’s ironic isn’t it? I was never a fan of gold. I’ve never owned a gold watch or enjoyed looking at gold-leaf details on buildings or even church altars. I passed on gold gowns with gold accessories for the red carpet. 'The golden years' is my least favorite metaphor for the period of life I’m living in. I have no interest in espousing the golden age of movies. I can’t stand CNN’s endless retirement commercials where two attractive elderly people smile at each other as they hold hands while walking into a soothing landscape, as if to say, It’s so peaceful accepting the autumn of life. Golden Oldies. The golden rule. A heart of gold. Worth its weight in gold. Gold shmold. The one saying that resonates through example, the one that has heart, the one that’s worth its weight in gold is simple and true: ""Old is gold.”In Keaton’s case it definitely is. As I faced off against a soaking downpour on my way to hear her speak, I heard a joyous shriek near the 92Y entrance — it was Keaton, splashing through puddles as she dashed for the doors.  I had just seen that same buoyant smile and sprint on The Tonight Show while watching Keaton chase Jimmy Fallon around the stage in a zany game of improvised beer pong. Both then and after the 92Y reading I thought to myself — she's unbeatable.Read more from Next Avenue: Tips for retirees looking for fun summer jobs The best ways to avoid household accidents Can't sleep at night?

Franklin Graham and other Christian evangelical leaders (including Ralph Reed), questioning them about the decreasing numbers of people attending church and religious services these days.Rev. Graham, when the discussion turned to same-sex marriage and gay adoption, I had to take issue with you when you said you agreed with Vladimir Putin that we need to protect the children and not allow gays to adopt. You believe only a man and a woman in a ""traditional"" marriage can properly raise a child up in to the way they should go. This outdated viewpoint reminds me of a book I read in the 1960s entitled Your God Is Too Small. The author, J.B. Phillips, talks about how man has created God in his own image. In this case, I believe that you, Reverend, are clinging to some Old Testament version of God as a vengeful deity condemning homosexuality as a sin.My God is an awesome God who so loved the world that he gave us his son, Jesus, to die for our sins. My God created me just as I am, a gay woman who is, first and foremost, a human being who wants to fall in love, marry, and raise a family and teach my children (if I ever have any) to love and respect all God's creatures, great and small.Are you saying that people like Robin Roberts, or Ellen and Portia, or Neil Patrick Harris, or Ricky Martin would not make good parents because they were born gay? Are you saying they should be deprived the basic human right of having or adopting and raising children?Rev. Graham, I have some close lesbian- and gay-couple friends who are fantastic parents. They love their children very much, and all their lives are very enriched by it. I played with my brass quintet for the wedding of two gay men in the 1990s. They are both devout Catholics, one being an organist and composer. I cried at their ceremony because I felt their strong love for one another. Gay marriage, at that time, was considered blasphemous, yet here they were, exchanging vows in a Catholic church. It was very moving to me and, as it turns out, a premonition of things to come, with same-sex marriage now on the threshold of being accepted nationally.They recently adopted a beautiful baby girl, who just turned 1. (I attended her birthday party.) I cry every time I think of how much love they have for their daughter and how they spoil and shower her with affection. Do you really think your God would want to deny these loving parents the joy and blessings this sweet child has brought them? I am disappointed in what you said, because I actually attended a revival meeting that your father, the Rev. Billy Graham, led when I was in junior high school. I went forward to accept Jesus as my savior then, and it changed my life. I know that you, Dr. Franklin Graham, have brought many to Christ and done so much good, including founding Samaritan's Purse, which supports those in need all over the world (including in Haiti after their earthquake). But I would like to suggest to you that many gays are today's Good Samaritans of the world.Having had to face religious persecution and being accused of causing hurricanes and earthquakes and told we are going to Hell has caused many of us to have to search inwardly spiritually. I know that is my case. My Baptist church told me homosexuality was a sin and a sickness like mental illness. So it took me a while to face my truth. But when I did, God was there for me.As you and others on the show acknowledged, we are all sinners, and gays can get into heaven if we repent. But I really like what commentator Cokie Roberts, who was raised Catholic, said: ""Gays would agree that they are sinners, but not because they are gay.""Bravo, Cokie. You get us and see that love is the way, and here's hoping more eyes will be opened to the truth that has set us free."
