Not only that, but upbeat people attract other upbeat people, so by changing your attitude, you can set in motion positive reinforcement for a new and improved outlook. How great is your life already? Ask your heart. Your mind will tell you what you lack, which in turn will make you miserable. Your heart, however, will say, ""Everything is perfect, just as it is. Let's celebrate!"" To access this heart-driven attitude, become aware of how much there is to appreciate, right now. These five steps will help:1. Appreciate your friends. Your friends are the dancing arms of your heart. Relationships are everywhere, and chances are that you have friends in your life. Consider the qualities you appreciate in your friends and take a moment to savor their gifts in your life. Since these individuals are connected with you, they may share your attributes. Take a moment to appreciate your own qualities too. Through acknowledging and celebrating your friends, you take the first step in knowing how fortunate you are. 2. Party frequently. We typically throw parties for birthdays, weddings, housewarmings, graduations, and job promotions. How much farther can you go in appreciating the favorable circumstances of your life? Consider throwing a party in celebration of your body parts that still work well, or having a toast in honor of cleaning your house. Take nothing for granted, give yourself permission to get silly, and indulge the celebration mindset.3. Honor your metamorphosis. The first two steps are the easy ones; everyone can learn to appreciate the fun stuff. To go farther in recognizing the greatness of your life, you need to dig a little deeper -- into areas you might not have considered. Take a moment to honor that which has made you great, even if it involved painful challenges, like a difficult childhood. Struggling through difficulties can be a fast track to developing resilience and compassion. Acknowledge and celebrate whatever qualities you have cultivated through your struggles.4. Rejoice in your growing pains. Look at the unfavorable circumstances of your life as being the seeds of your future greatness. How wonderful that your life has provided stimulus for more growth! Without this stimulus, you might simply plateau. Imagine how great you will be once you have resolved your current challenges and see yourself in training for that greatness -- like an Olympic champion. Practice gratitude for the demands of your metaphysical workout. 5. Celebrate your shortcomings. When you can celebrate your faults and failures, you truly have embraced your great life. See your faults as reflections of your archetype. Highly-intelligent people, for example, may be absentminded, socially-awkward, and fashion-impaired. Their shortcomings simply verify their strength and focus. Perhaps you are a king or queen archetype. If so, you may have shortcomings like being a control freak or stubborn. Regardless, majesty is a great quality. If you have the faults of a queen or king, you just might have their greatness too.So go ahead: Whoever you are, whatever you have endured, and wherever you are heading, take a moment to savor your life and bask in how great it all truly is. If you appreciate your friends, party frequently, honor your metamorphosis, rejoice in your growing pains and celebrate your shortcomings, you will have entered the space of the invincible heart.For more by Susanna Bair, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here.

Heinz by Warren Buffett and private equity put food executives on notice: start showing better results or risk being left behind.The deal, and the ripples it creates in the sector, was the buzz of the consumer industry's annual get-together in Florida this week, sponsored by the Consumer Analyst Group of New York.In private discussions overlooking a yacht-filled marina or in the hallway between the Nespresso table and the Coca-Cola Freestyle machine, the consensus among executives, analysts and investors was clear: gear up for a new era of belt-tightening, if not more acquisitions and divestitures, in the sector.""This is the first large deal in years by a financial buyer that calls out the lackluster fundamentals in the U.S. packaged food space,"" said Robert Dickerson, an analyst with boutique firm Consumer Edge Research.Industry veterans are already beset by anemic sales growth and margin pressure, thanks to weak economies in Europe and the United States, changing consumer demographics, volatile commodity costs and competition from lower-cost rivals.Some of the principals of 3G Capital, Buffett's partner in the Heinz deal, were also behind the rise of AmBev, a Brazilian brewer, into the world's largest beer maker, Anheuser Busch InBev. Expansion and cost-cutting were hallmarks of their strategy, and the industry expects it to be the same here.It is unclear what, if any, other targets 3G might have in mind. Campbell Soup has long been seen as a good candidate, though roughly half of its stock is controlled by heirs of John Dorrance, who invented condensed soup.Campbell Soup Chief Executive Denise Morrison declined to comment on a potential merger with Heinz, but she did say the news put her on guard.""For me, it's a heightened signal that I've got to be even more aggressive about costs,"" she said in an interview. ""Campbell is always looking for ways to create better productivity and I think this is a good call to action.""Campbell has already been cutting costs, including by closing factories, as it works to turn around its sagging U.S. soup business. WHAT'S NEXT?Given its news, Heinz canceled its presentation at the annual conference. But that did not stop the chatter.""Any time there's a deal, everybody wonders if it's a catalyst to other deals and that remains to be seen,"" said Irene Rosenfeld, CEO of Mondelez International, who last year oversaw the spin-off of Kraft Foods Group. She told Reuters that companies with ""good strategic planning"" pay more attention to their own circumstances than what happens outside.ConAgra Foods Inc CEO Gary Rodkin, who just acquired private label food maker Ralcorp, said deal momentum could now pick up, if 3G buys more companies or if other companies get inspired by the Heinz deal.""It just could be the mentality is, 'that's how we're going to create more shareholder value in this industry',"" Rodkin said in an interview.There has already been a wave of much smaller transactions in the food industry, with the split ups of Sara Lee into Hillshire Brands and D.E. Master Blenders, Kraft into Kraft Foods Group and Mondelez International, and Fortune Brands into Fortune Brands Home & Security and Beam Inc.In addition, there was Canada's Saputo buying Morningstar from Dean Foods and Kellogg buying Pringles from Procter & Gamble.Packaged food is a ""business that rearranges the furniture a lot,"" said Campbell's Morrison. Many other top executives at the conference, including Hillshire's Sean Connolly and Clorox Co's Don Knauss said they were open to ""bolt-on"" acquisitions. SPIN-OFFS STARTINGLate on Thursday, Heinz reported third-quarter earnings and said it would divest Shanghai LongFong Foods, a frozen food business in China. It said it anticipates securing a deal with a suitable buyer in the next 12 months.Analysts said other divestitures could follow, as 3G reviews the Heinz portfolio which spans Ore-Ida frozen potatoes to baked beans.""It seems equally likely that this could spur divestitures as well as acquisitions,"" said Moody's analyst Brian Weddington. He said other frozen food businesses, which include Smart Ones frozen entrees, might be candidates, since they have been challenging for Heinz.But one issue that could stand in the way of more merger activity is the high asset prices sellers are seeking, since cheap financing tends to lead to lofty valuations, said General Mills Chief Financial Officer Don Mulligan.""We've seen that both for brands we looked at in the U.S. and in emerging markets,"" Mulligan said. ""There's a lot more reasons deals can fail than they succeed."""

Russia, where the actor has appeared in advertising campaigns for ketchup and a film about the monk Grigory Rasputin, has a flat tax of 13 percent on income.""For me registration here isn't a formality.

Depardieu used to live in a mansion on the Left Bank of the Seine in Paris.Russian media cited the region's press minister as saying Depardieu also planned to build a small house in the countryside. For now, Depardieu is registered to reside in an apartment in the city owned by relatives of a friend.Located on the river Volga some 620 km (390 miles) east of Moscow, Saransk is the capital of Mordovia, a republic in central Russia that was quick to try and persuade Depardieu to set up residence. In January, Depardieu turned down an offer to become the region's Minister of Culture.France's Constitutional Council last month blocked the planned 75 percent tax rate on income over 1 million euros ($1.32 million) in December, but the government has said it will press ahead with a redrafted tax on the wealthy.($1 = 0.76 euros)(Reporting by Jason Bush; Editing by Jason Webb)"

From an internal memo:âTo become the absolute best place to work, communication and collaboration will be important, so we need to be working side-by-side. That is why it is critical that we are all present in our offices. Some of the best decisions and insights come from hallway and cafeteria discussions, meeting new people, and impromptu team meetings. Speed and quality are often sacrificed when we work from home.â (READ THE ENTIRE YAHOO MEMO AT ALL THINGS D)Swisher also reports, perhaps unsurprisingly, âstrongâ anger among those affected by the policy, many of whom joined the company in part because of the flexibility that Yahoo previously provided. But donât just assume that telecommuting, or working remotely, or whatever you want to call it, comes from a place of laziness. A number of studies have proven quite the opposite:- A Stanford study, conveniently released on the same day as Yahooâs memo, reported that call center employees increased their performance by 13 percent when working from home. They also reported âimproved work satisfaction and experienced less turnover,â according to the study.- A University of Texas at Austin study from late last year found that those people who work from home âadd five to seven hours to their workweek compared with those who work exclusively at the office.â Such workhorses, we homeworkers are!- A Bureau of Labor Statistics study, also from last year, reported that working remotely âseems to boost productivity, decrease absenteeismâ -- that means missing work -- âand increase retention.â It also gives employers more incentive to ask you to work on weekends, the authors say. Boo!!- According to some recent research published in the MIT Sloan Management Review, bosses are roughly 9 percent more likely to consider you âdependableâ and âreponsibleâ if you âput in expected face timeâ Translation: Being at the office can help you get that raise you so desire. All in all, it appears working from home is a bit of mixed bag for employee and employer alike. On the one hand, enhanced productivity, more work satisfaction, less turnover -- all good things! On the other, longer hours, more weekend obligations, less chance of impressing the boss -- not so good! Looks like Yahoo just took a big chance. "

(Photo by Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4189c260000e9008242e3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Anna Karenina, one of last year's most talked-about productions, is a product of a longstanding friendship between a director and his muse.There is plenty that works in the newest adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's oft-told tale of a woman caught between rigid social norms and a passionate love that fails to transcend them. Joe Wright, the seemingly infallible filmmaking sensation who burst onto the scene in 2005 with his fresh take on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, delivers a version of Anna Karenina that manages to sidestep that traditional (and dangerously reductive) martyr-whore dilemma. Conscious of the fact that most audiences know exactly where the story, and particularly the main character, is headed, he generously foreshadows Anna's demise by utilizing train imagery throughout the film, creating palpable tension that is so often absent in costume dramas based on literary classics. It also helps that Wright once again trusts his longtime muse Keira Knightley to embody Anna's fervor and petulance.The relationship between Knightley and Wright harks back to that 2005 adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, the movie that cemented the young actress as a bona fide actress after Pirates of the Caribbean made her the rising movie star to look out for, and resulted in an Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of Elizabeth Bennet. Much of that film's popularity was surely due to the refreshing physicality of the production -- Wright set much of the movie outside, his characters threading through mud and morning mist, conversing in drawing rooms as well as in pigsties. The spectacularly lush cinematography that would become a staple of Wright's, along with wonderful production design, never took away from the gravity and humanness of the characters. The directorial debut was a good indicator of what Wright's career -- particularly his artistic marriage with Knightley -- would become: a visceral, stripped-down vision of glamor and opulence that works in support of the characters and never merely for its own sake. Even at the tender age of 18, Knightley was up for the challenge -- her Elizabeth Bennet embodied both the playful, young spirit of Austen's beloved heroine and her untamed intelligence that breaks through the barriers of normative behavior whenever she is affronted by the sullen Mr. Darcy.Then came 2007's Atonement, the adaptation of the acclaimed Ian McEwan novel, and the second Wright-Knightley collaboration. Here, three generations of great actresses (Saoirse Ronan, Romola Garai and Vanessa Redgrave) playing the abominable Briony Tallis, one of today's great literary characters, utilized extraordinary tactility. In contrast, Knightley played the enigmatic heroine Cecilia in the most minimal, mythical way possible. All of the agency and quiet determination she had exhibited in Pride and Prejudice was now gone -- her character instead became the embodiment of a muse, the tragic, beautiful creature that Wright got to dress in the most fluid and delicately erotic of costumes, particularly the much-celebrated green dress that has since been called one of the greatest movie costumes of all time.Which brings us to Anna Karenina, a film that could easily be considered the third part of a Wright-Knightley trilogy. Apart from the collaboration, the film marks the third time Wright is adapting a literary work of great celebrity and acclaim. It feels like a combination of the two movies preceding it. In a featurette released on the film's official YouTube channel, Wright justifiably calls Knigthley ""utterly fearless."" Indeed, there is a great visceral quality to her Anna, particularly in scenes that call for uninhibited emoting. However, this palpability of affectation is contained in a film of extraordinary fragility -- the decision to set the action on a stage that, throughout the film, morphs and sometimes disappears altogether, only to reappear in the most surprising of scenes, makes the relationship between the characters that much more theatrical and nuanced. The unusual setting not only allows Wright to lay the ""all the world's a stage"" metaphor quite heavily onto his audiences (and rightly so, for it could be argued that the story would take a fairly different turn if the characters weren't constantly on display, admired and judged in equal measure by the rest of the society), but it also gives a much-needed freshness to the story by framing it as a dazzling dream rather than the hard-hitting drabness that often represents Russia.Other than Knightley's thoughtful, versatile performance as the volatile Anna, the film boasts other familiar faces. Matthew Macfadyen, Mr. Darcy to Knightley's Elizabeth Bennet, here plays Stiva Oblonsky, Anna's brother, and provides a nice societal contrast -- unlike Anna's, his infidelities go tolerated and unpunished. Aaron Taylor-Johnson infuses the film with a jolt of youthful energy in the role of dashing Alexei Vronsky, playing him as an antithesis to Jude Law's Karenin. Law, in turn, manages to steal the show, adding a layer of humanity to the emotionally barren character in spite of a somewhat flawed Tom Stoppard-penned script that tends to rush the proceedings before the emotional impact has fully registered with the audience. The nuanced performances, coupled with sumptuous costumes and Wright's whimsical and innovative direction, are reason enough to reignite our passion for Anna Karenina, despite the imminent fatality that too passionate a love may result in. Ultimately, it is a platform for Knightley to demonstrate both her commandeering screen presence and acute understanding of the character, complemented by Wright's dazzling spectacle."

The U.S. Justice Department declined to comment.A settlement could avert a bruising courtroom battle over the worst ever U.S. offshore oil spill slated to start on Monday in New Orleans, although the trial may begin as the terms of the deal are hammered out.A settlement would also put a solid number on BP's costs under the Clean Water Act, which range from $4.5 billion to $17.5 billion, as well as potential natural resources damage assessments to the states under the Oil Pollution Act.""BP doesn't talk about possible offers or negotiations, but I can tell you we are ready for trial and looking forward to the opportunity to present our case starting Monday,"" BP spokesman Geoff Morrell said when contacted by Reuters.BP has spent or committed $37 billion on cleanup, restoration, payouts, settlements and fines.

Watch carefully and ""child proof"" your home and the child's playspace. This is a great time for lots of good, safe toys that offer varied play experiences. The right toys help your toddler learn about color, shape, size and weight. Constantly check things out so they match your child's growing interests and responses. Play will help develop better coordination, strong muscles and inquisitive minds. With blocks the child gains small muscle strength and counting skills. It's fun to build up, take down and rebuild. Plus, children learn a lot as they create. Toddlers enjoy a range of toys that include a soft doll, pail, shovel, push-pull toy, jack-in-the-box, bubble pipe, pounding set, ring stack, puzzle, pounding set, books and tapes. Toddlers love to play with household objects such as plastic dishes, pots, pans and cups. A small broom will give the child a chance to sweep.  When selecting toddler toys consider: â¢ Is it durable?  â¢ How long will the toy last under ""toddler testing""?  â¢ Is it childproof? A product should be long-lasting, substantial and made of good, strong materials.Stuffed toys must be hygienic, washable and not have any fluff that could be pulled off and put in the mouth. Protect the child from small parts or anything tiny that could cause choking. All products must be non-toxic. Toddlers play with or near other children, at their own pace. Contact with other children is important, so playgroups are a great way for them to socialize, learn to take turns and engage with others. Observe how the children interact with people and objects. This is the time to build self-esteem. Notice the way children feel about themselves and how it affects physical, emotional, and mental growth.For more details about ""Toddler Play"" see ""Chapter Three: in my book Smart Play Smart Toys.

Metro contacted the Wiltshire Involvement Network, a patient watchdog group, which called the incident ""tragic.""""With this type of operation men need confidence they can put their trust fully in the hospital,"" WIN chairman Phil Matthews said, per Metro.Reached by the Salisbury Journal, a hospital spokesperson confirmed the hospital had received notice of the suit.âThis is a regrettable incident and the trust once again offers its sincere apologies to the patient,"" the spokesperson told the Salisbury Journal. ""Remedial surgery took place at the time and the patient was informed straight after the completion of surgery of the situation and that additional surgery had taken place to rectify this.â While unfortunate, these types of medical accidents are not as rare as you might think. The Associated Press reported that a U.S. Air Force veteran filed a similar suit against the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center,  after doctors removed his healthy right testicle, instead of his atrophied left one in 2007.Similarly, doctors at the West Suffolk Hospital in Bury St. Edmunds, England, botched a testicular operation on a man in 2010, which resulted in the patient becoming infertile, according to The Independent."
