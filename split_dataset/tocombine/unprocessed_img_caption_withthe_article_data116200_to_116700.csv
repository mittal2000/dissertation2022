1,POLITICS,Union Plows Ahead After Major SCOTUS Setback,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/harris-v-quinn-seiu-minnesota_n_5568105.html,,2014-07-08,"WASHINGTON, DC - OCTOBER 24: Service Employees International Union President Mary Kay Henry addresses a conference commemorating the 10th anniversary of the Center for American Progress in the Astor Ballroom of the St. Regis Hotel October 24, 2013 in Washington, DC. Co-founded by former Clinton Administration Chief of Staff John Podesta, the liberal public policy research and advocacy organization is a think tank that rivals conservative policy groups, such as the Heritage Foundation and the American Enterprise Institute. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cf0e2100004502c9629b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After being dealt a major setback by the Supreme Court just two weeks ago, the Service Employees International Union is plowing ahead in its efforts to organize home care workers, filing a petition Tuesday for what could be one of the largest union elections in Minnesota history.According to SEIU, the election would cover an estimated 26,000 Medicaid-funded home care workers in the state who assist the elderly and people with disabilities. Under a hotly debated law passed last year, unions in Minnesota are allowed to organize day care and home care workers who work in clients' homes and are paid in part through the federal health care program.The Minnesota Bureau of Mediation Services, the agency that would oversee the election, confirmed that it received the petition and will be reviewing the signatures. Under the law, the union would need 30 percent of the estimated bargaining unit -- or nearly 9,000 workers -- to have affirmed their desire for an election.""That is a big election,"" said Jan Johnson, labor mediation manager at the agency, which covers mostly public-sector labor relations. Johnson added that she believes it would be the largest election the agency has handled.The timing of the petition is significant for SEIU. Late last month, the Supreme Court delivered a blow to unions like SEIU and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees with its ruling in Harris v. Quinn. In a 5-4 decision, the conservative justices determined that home care workers who don't want to be part of the union can't be required to pay so-called ""fair share"" fees to cover the cost of representation. The ruling will make it harder for unions to maintain dues-paying members in what has been a growth area for organized labor in recent years. That, in turn, could make it a less attractive organizing target. After the ruling, however, SEIU insisted it would continue to invest in organizing home care workers. On a call with reporters after the ruling, SEIU President Mary Kay Henry said that ""despite today's decision, we are ready to move forward.""""No court case is going to stand in the way of home care workers,"" she said. ""We need to build a stable, qualified workforce.""The Harris v. Quinn ruling disappointed not only labor unions but also disability rights groups that believe the presence of unions has helped raise both working standards and the quality of care in the field, which often provides low pay and few benefits. The ruling did not, however, disrupt unions' right to organize such workers.Sumer Spika has been a home care worker in Minnesota for six years. A supporter of SEIU, Spika said she receives ""no benefits of any sort"" and no training through the job. After having her baby by a cesarean section two years ago, she said she had little choice but to go back to work a week after the delivery to care for her client. At times, she's relied on food stamps, she said.Spika, 35, said she sees a union as an ""opportunity to provide a better life for myself and my family, and especially for my client."" ""I love my job -- that's why I've continued doing it,"" she said. ""Hopefully if we have a union, we can bargain for all the things we've been fighting for -- better pay, benefits, sick days and, most of all, training.""Under heavy Republican opposition, the law allowing unions to organize workers like Spika barely eked through the Minnesota House, passing by a vote of 68 to 66 before being signed last year by Gov. Mark Dayton, a member of the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party. "

The episode has largely halted the appropriations process in the Senate until a dispute over amendments can be resolved.House Appropriations Committee Chairman Harold Rogers, also from Kentucky, said in a statement: ""This legislation contains important provisions to rein in the harmful regulatory overreach of federal bureaucracies that will unnecessarily cause job loss and that will weaken our recovering economy.""The EPA regulations proposed in early June would set the U.S. power sector on a path to cut carbon dioxide emissions 30 percent by 2030 from 2005 levels, forming the centerpiece of President Barack Obama's climate change strategy. Some plants would be forced to close or shift from coal to lower-carbon fuels such as natural gas.The proposed House measure would cut EPA's funding by 9 percent, or $717 million to a total of $7.5 billion and limit its staff to 15,000, the lowest level since 1989.It seeks to prohibit the agency from implementing rule changes to the Clean Water Act that could restrict land alterations by farmers and developers and to block changes to regulations that effectively allow mining firms to dump mine waste into streams.The spending bill also would delay any designation of the greater sage grouse as an endangered species for a year. Federal protection for the chicken-sized fowl native to several western states could impose limits on oil and gas exploration, hunting and ranching in its habitat.""It's clear that House Republicans have once again chosen to play politics with America's air and water rather than put forward a reasonable bill with a chance at becoming law,"" Joshua Saks, the National Wildlife Federation's legislative director, said in a statement.

In Portland, Maine, the city council repealed a 39-foot buffer zone and called on city staff to propose alternatives. The cities of Burlington, Vermont, and Madison, Wisconsin, have stopped enforcing their buffer zone laws.Jennifer Frizzell, the vice president for public policy for Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, which operates several clinics in the state, said the organization did not intend to post a buffer zone around its clinics on Thursday.""No matter what agenda these protesters and outside legal groups might pursue, Planned Parenthood's number one priority remains the safety and privacy of our patients and staff,"" Frizzell said.(Editing by Scott Malone and Peter Cooney)"

By halftime, shock and grief prevailed in the nation hosting the 2014 World Cup. In between, Germany racked up all the goals it needed to book a spot in final. In the first half hour of play in their semifinal clash, Germany built an astounding 5-0 lead over Brazil at Estadio Mineirao in Belo Horizonte on Tuesday. In the perfunctory second half, Germany ran the score to 7-0 before Brazil pulled back a late consolation goal. It was the most goals that Brazil had ever conceded at home and just the second time it had ever conceded seven goals in any match, according to ESPN Stats & Info. ""This is utterly beyond belief,"" ESPN commentator Ian Darke exclaimed after Sami Khedira scored Germany's fifth goal of the first half in the 29th minute. The deluge of goals began when Germany striker Thomas Muller scored his 10th career World Cup goal in the 11th minute. The 24-year-old volleyed the ball past Brazil goalkeeper Julio Cesar after a Germany corner kick in the 11th minute. Miroslav Klose then doubled Germany's advantage with a milestone strike in the 23rd minute. The 36-year-old veteran became the all-time leading scorer in the World Cup with his 16th career goal in the tournament. He had tied Brazil's Ronaldo with his 15th goal earlier in the 2014 World Cup.

It also allows gun manufacturers in the state to make guns without serial numbers and guns designed to avoid metal detectors. The law prohibits background checks for guns made in Kansas and the tracking of guns used in crimes. It also prevents local authorities from referring gun crimes to federal agencies.Details of the Brady Center’s impending lawsuit, which will be filed in the U.S. District Court of Kansas, will be announced in a news conference Wednesday.Brownback responded to news of the lawsuit in a statement Monday.""As I have said previously, the right to keep and bear arms is a right that Kansans hold dear.

In less than a year, the so-called self-defense groups achieved what the federal government with its police force and army could not do in 12 years: oust from the state the criminals who made their life miserable. Remarkably, this story does not have a very happy ending or beginning.The ordeal in Michoacán started when the internal fights of the drug cartels active in the area produced a splinter group called the Order of the Templars. They rose to control nearly all legal and illegal economic activities in the state. They took over the main port of the state to smuggle precursor chemicals from China and cocaine from Colombia and Peru with the intent to sell them in the United States -- and CDs, DVDs and designer clothes made by pirate organizations for domestic consumption.The corrupting power of the Templars extended to the world of politics controlling most mayors, placing their people in key positions and supporting the political campaigns of candidates from all parties. The Templars were the indisputable authority in the state, an authority that enabled them to abuse anyone they wished.To kick the Templars out, the self-defense group sought and got the help of another criminal organization. The assistance was prompt and so brutal it began by throwing the severed heads of six members of the Templars in the dance hall of a local bar, under the complacent gaze of corrupt local authorities.That all this mess took place in the Mexican state where former President Felipe Calderón was born, and where he started the drug war that was to be the landmark of his administration, exposes not only his biggest blunder but also sets a dangerous precedent in a country where respect for the rule of law is not deeply ingrained in the culture.It also raises several questions. To help us understand why the self-defense groups succeeded where the Calderon administration failed, I asked Salvadoran former guerrilla commander and one of Calderon's security advisors Joaquín Villalobos to offer an explanation. ""The self-defense groups are territorial natural forces linked to the local population,"" he says. ""In the same way that drug dealers or guerrillas are connected to the local population, they live in the same territory. The police and armies that the government uses to combat criminals are specialized and professional forces without local roots. They are like parachutists that touch and go. With qualified police and the military you can destroy cartels, but without territorial forces, it is impossible to reduce violence.""LIKE LOCAL GUERILLAS  Self-defense groups are reportedly being formed in at least eight states of the Mexican republic, but Raymundo Riva Palacio, a veteran Mexican journalist, believes that is a slight exaggeration. ""There are self-defense groups in Guerrero, but in the rest of the republic they are totally under the control of the government,"" he says. ""What is true is that in Acapulco, widows and mothers of victims of criminal violence are organizing their groups and the same is true among the indigenous peoples of the state of Guerrero.""Public opinion polls show that the majority of Mexicans believe self-defense is the best way to protect your community, and a larger majority sees nothing wrong with vigilante justice. One could argue that such an outcome is predictable in a country where 105,000 people are kidnapped for ransom every year, where criminal groups blackmail one of every 10 Mexicans and 96 percent of recorded crimes go unpunished. Notwithstanding the public support and the dismal justice record, do people have the right to bear arms to protect themselves in a country that forbids the sale and use of arms? Is the Mexican government so weak it needs citizens militia to protect its citizens? Will these armed movements help build institutions in Mexico? Is vigilante justice the way of the future?""Vigilantism is a genie that no one really wants to let out of the bottle. Once it starts, how do you control it?"" says Charles Shapiro, former U.S. ambassador to Venezuela and current president of the Institute of the Americas in San Diego, California. ""Vigilantism in the name of the law is in many ways antithetical to the rule of law. Unlike the state, which also manages to abuse power regularly, self-defense group don't recognize the role of courts, prosecutors, or laws. On the other hand, if the state can't maintain law and order does it forgo its right to hold the monopoly of power in a territory?""THE COLOMBIANIZATION OF MEXICO  The temptation to compare Mexico's current problems with Colombia's in the 1980s and 90s is irresistible. In Colombia, there was a time when paramilitary armies were used to protect mostly wealthy people, from FARC and ELN guerrillas and drug cartels. Former Colombian President César Gaviria says it is hard to compare the two phenomena, however, he says ""there is one basic similarity, in both countries the people end-up trying to administer justice. The problem, though, is that so-called self-defense groups only generate more violence. In Colombia, the purported solution became a bigger problem. With the paramilitary, the drug cartels multiplied, and it was only with the assistance of Plan Colombia that the Colombian government was able to combat all of them.""Can these self-defense groups help to build institutions in Mexico? Peter Hakim, president emeritus and senior fellow of the Inter-American Dialogue says it's not likely. ""But I am sure you can identify countries in which they have,"" he says. ""In Peru they helped defeat Sendero Luminoso. However, history shows vigilantism it is far too dangerous. Clearly, the Mexican government does not do a great job protecting its citizens or asserting the rule of law very effectively but Brazil is not doing much better. Rural riots are a constant in China, and the U.S. essentially refused to enforce the laws in the South for many years.""Once the self-defense groups of Michoacan expelled the Templars, the government of Enrique Peña Nieto decided to incorporate them into some sort of ""rural police""-- a questionable decision that sets a bad precedent and could have dire consequences. ""That was a serious mistake because it contaminates the police force,"" says Gaviria, alluding to its links with drug cartels. Riva Palacio, the Mexican journalist concurs: ""it is a judicial aberration to pretend to bring about the rule of law using illegal paramilitary forces and it will not help the country advance in the right direction.""Before rushing to blame Mexico for its real problems, one must understand the context of the present day story. Michoacán is in such trouble because of the insatiable appetite for drugs in the United States and because people there kill each other with weapons purchased in the U.S. and smuggled into Mexico. Mexico has a terrible problem that often seems uncontrollable and is tearing it apart, but the United States must take responsibility for the havoc its voracious drug addiction and obscene weapons trade has wrought on its neighbor."

It was the first visit by President Xi to Seoul after he took on the role as China's leader. China hopes to promote its benign image in South Korea (the Chinese First Lady Peng Liyuan certainly played her role) and to increase influence in the Korean Peninsula vis-a-vis the U.S. A South Korea-China free trade agreement will be signed within next six months to enhance economic partnership to a higher degree. South Korea, as the strong ally of the U.S., is now faced with the growing challenge of the competing ""G2 diplomacy"" between U.S. and China in Northeast Asia. We are in the middle.North Korea under Kim Jong-un rattled his sabers with ballistic missile launches into the sea to protest Xi Jinping's high-profile visit to Seoul (even before visiting Pyongyang) and to pressure the Japanese and Americans to remove sanctions due to nuclear tests. Meanwhile, Pyongyang has begun to break its isolation by starting to negotiate with Japan for the return of Japanese abductees, diplomatic rapprochement, and financial benefits of eased sanctions. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan is certainly taking risks in dealing with a hostile North Korea, apparently for domestic political gain.South Korea's relations with Japan, by contrast, have gotten complicated due to historical issues and Japan's re-militarization policy. The Park Geun-hye government demands genuine repentance, an official apology and proper compensation from Abe government similar to what post-war Germany did for its war victims. The Abe government's new collective self-defense policy is also creating tension between South Korea and Japan because of concern about Japan's rearmament. The ""cold war"" between Seoul and Tokyo these days is seriously impairing the basis of pragmatic partnership based on democracy and the free market system. This is creating opportunities for China to pursue a ""united front"" with South Korea against Japan over past history, including the Pacific War. Xi Jinping boldly proposed in his Seoul visit that China and South Korea should jointly commemorate the 70th anniversary next year of the end of the ""anti-Japanese War"" in Asia in 1945. President Park cautiously reserved her answer to the request.Russia has been collaborating with China more closely in the aftermath of the Ukraine crisis as we witnessed in the 30-year natural gas supply deal between the two giants of the Eurasian continent. Russia also has been actively investing into North Korea to secure a key strategic economic outlet to the Pacific Ocean. Russia is taking advantage of the recently strained North Korea-China relations in the aftermath of the sudden execution of Jang Song-thaek, previously the second powerful man in Pyongyang acting as the political and business intermediary between North Korea and China.So, here is the upshot: China's continuous rise and China's active strategic engagement with South Korea are increasingly challenging the basis of the U.S.-Japan-South Korea cooperative triangle in Northeast Asia. South Korea, on its part, is also upgrading its cooperation with China on an economic partnership, a political dialogue (to persuade North Korea to renounce its nuclear ambition) and on the historical posture vis-a-vis Japan. South Korea is inevitably caught between escalating Sino-Japanese conflicts. In response, Japan is approaching North Korea (and Russia too) for settling the old disputes and expanding strategic interests.We are in the middle of a Hobbesian transformation of the post-Cold War regional order in Northeast Asia. South Korea stands at a major crossroads.Now, we are waiting for Pope Francis to visit Korea next month to bless us and pray for a peaceful national unification in the future."

However, on May 4, 2014, at age 44, I publicly declared myself a New York Rangers fan, and today, several sad, speechless days after their elimination from the Stanley Cup Finals, I still can't remember what else I used to think about. It's not like I woke up bored one day, or in need of a broken heart. In fact, I've watched Rangers games fairly regularly for the last two years. But at some point during the first round of the 2014 playoffs, my internal hockeylogue became impossible to ignore, and if I didn't share it outside my head, I was going to lose my mind. So, in the middle of Game 2 of the Rangers/Penguins series, I posted a comment on the team's Facebook page. They were 0-29 on the power play at the time, so I suggested that they try something different: ""How about the teams stay at 5 on 5, but Lundqvist gets a gun?"" That was a start. Still, in spite of a gratifying number of likes, I knew that Facebook was essentially house league. If I wanted to make the travel team, I needed to be on Twitter. Twitter, where if you can't say something perfect you shouldn't say anything at all. Twitter, where defenseman's Dan Girardi's name trended because so many fans thought he should kill himself after a bad -- OK, awful -- clear that led to an overtime goal. If I couldn't make it there... well, I wouldn't make it. And I needed to make it; I just wasn't sure why.So, yes, I was thinking about the Rangers at a funeral. My friend's father was a retired NYPD detective, a member of pretty much every Irish Catholic organization in the city, and the only active-duty cop ever to serve as Grand Marshal of the St. Patrick's Day parade. The church was full of dark blue uniforms and the green blazers of the Emerald Society, the altar was packed with priests, and not one but three bagpipe bands had assembled to play him home. After indulging in some traditional solipsistic wondering about what my own sendoff might look like, all those visible allegiances got to me. This was the celebration of a man who knew exactly who he was and why it mattered, and everybody there knew it too. My life felt fractured and factional in comparison. What color would people wear when I died? Would everyone be dressed in boring black, because I never chose a team, or picked a side?The further the Rangers advanced in the playoffs, the more I saw terms like ""bandwagon jumper"" leveled at latecomers like me. If I was going to be a fan, I had to work at it full-time. Luckily this task jibed nicely with the end of my spring semester. I was supposed to be finishing a book proposal; instead, I spent my days online falling down hockey rabbit holes: Gordie Howe hat tricks, the origin of ""Potvin sucks."" Besides, it's not like I had nothing going for me, cred-wise. My brothers and I all played hockey, which is not a sport you casually dabble in. We had a picture of the Miracle on Ice over the fireplace in our den, and John Vanbiesbrouck's and Brian Leetch's sticks lay like antlers across the mantel. My girls' team even shared practice ice with the Rangers at Rye Playland; my friends and I beamed sweatily at them until Tomas Sandstrom flipped us a puck. More recently, I turned down a chance to be interviewed on NPR so that I could watch Lundqvist play -- and lose -- in the men's Olympic final. I'd like to think this makes me a Rangers fan, but it probably just makes me an idiot. My husband has marveled for years at how quickly I get sucked into whatever sport I'm watching, in the same way that, if I put money in a jukebox, I will stay in that bar until I hear those songs. But to me, watching the Rangers no longer felt like entertainment. It felt like religion, a transcendent obligation. I used to mock fans and players who prayed for victory, as if God actually cared. Yet there I was, scanning online arcana, hoping to discern the teleology of a Rangers victory.That funeral was a month ago; the Rangers died in the finals one week later. I miss my friend, who now lives out West, and I miss his father, even though I hadn't spoken to him for 20 years. I didn't even know he was sick, which suggests that maybe I should stop obsessing about the Rangers and try to stay in closer touch with people I love. That right there may be why I finally became a sports fan. Maybe at 44 I need to care a lot about something that doesn't matter, because these days everything seems to matter so much. When the Rangers lost, I screamed at my TV, sobbed, and got on with my life. Or did I?My friends gently suggested the World Cup or baseball as a sort of methadone; however, what with Tim Howard's heroics in goal and all that overtime, rooting for the USMNT felt an awful lot like rooting for the Rangers -- and not in a good way. I love the Rangers because they fall apart like my daughter's PeeWee team when the first line bails for a bat mitzvah, but they almost always come back in some gloriously breathtaking way. Game 3 of the Finals, which, in spite of fierce play and several heart-stopping chances, my boys not only lost at home but were actually shut out, crushed me like a cartoon anvil. In Game 4, on the other hand, ""puck luck,"" or what coach Alain Vigneault called ""the hockey gods,"" finally worked in their favor, leaving the Kings' tying goal nestled gently in a tiny snowbank, out of Lundqvist's sight, right on the goal line. Suddenly it all seemed possible again, even though it wasn't. But it was! The Rangers were up by one in Game 5, having finally broken the curse of the dreaded 2-0 lead that had failed them twice in LA. The Staples Center was trembling with ecstasy, and the Cup remained safely outside the arena, until a completely egregious tripping call on Mats Zuccarello -- who the replay showed had clearly been tripped himself, by Jake Muzzin -- gave the Kings a power play goal and sent the Rangers to their Bad Place. Only Lundqvist still seemed to believe, and played to prove it, blocking a record 48 shots -- and with no help from the ice this time. Over the course of the second double overtime of the series, my Twitter feed started to split between Rangers commentary and the latest collapse of Iraq, putting the significance of a puckball contest in pretty clear perspective. How could anyone care about hockey when faced with the possibility of a third Gulf War? Then Alec Martinez scored the Cup-winning goal off a sloppy rebound, and Lundqvist, too, collapsed. His stricken expression, the way he waved off the comfort of his teammates, made it hard to argue that the loss didn't matter. In the realm of things that didn't matter, it mattered immensely, as thousands of blue-shirted people and I suddenly found ourselves watching a funeral instead of a hockey game. I learned the hard way that the first and foremost truth of being a fan is that we are helpless. Our cheers and tweets and waving towels may feel like psychic contributions to the success of our team, but they don't mean anything compared to what happens on the ice. Still, the adrenalin, the nausea, the disappointment and second-guessing are nothing next to all the love and loss I feel for the Rangers, dammit. I want to watch Carl Hagelin's Prince-Valiant hair stream behind him on a game-winning breakaway. I want Brad Richards to score a billion goals so that management lets him play out his contract (he didn't and they didn't, although rumor has it he may be back in 2015). I want to see Lundqvist forget his royal status and hop like a drunk Muppet, the way he did when they beat the Habs and he realized they were going for the Cup. I want to see the Rangers win, and then I want to rejoice about it on and offline with a bunch of blue-clad people I barely know. I'm old enough to understand that I probably won't get what I want, but at least with the Rangers, as opposed to my life, it probably won't be my fault. Fandom is the most frustrating and the most rewarding form of faith; its efficacy or lack thereof is often immediately apparent, and ritual and fellowship are its only sure rewards. Faith alone will not alter whatever turns out to be true; it just helps us to live with a little more color, and maybe to die in peace.Follow Beth Boyle Machlan on Twitter at @bethmachlanAn earlier version of this essay appeared on The Modern SpectatorCORRECTION: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated that Game 5 was held at Madison Square Garden in New York.

Knox was sentenced to 28 1/2 years in prison, raising the specter of a long legal battle over her extradition. After nearly 12 hours of deliberation Thursday the court reinstated the guilty verdict first handed down against Knox and Raffaele Sollecito in 2009.

ThompsonWhen I wrote the May 2014 piece Where Are All The Feminists? Why Amanda Knox's Story Is About More Than Murder, I was well aware of how deeply polarizing this case has been over the past several years. This is evidenced by the many inaccurate pieces written on the Meredith Kercher murder, and for me, Selene Nelson's obtuse Huffington Post response, Why Feminists Owe Amanda Knox Nothing. In her piece, she questions my knowledge of the case (all but two of her links to ""evidence"" direct readers to private, biased anti-Knox sites) and cleverly masquerades sexism as feminism. Nelson clearly doesn't see this, but she has wonderfully proven my original idea correct. When I wrote, ""Amanda Knox is innocent,"" I believed it. I continue to believe it. The innocence is clear once you navigate the twisted, false and misinterpreted information published every day. That's the issue. There's a lot of faulty reportage out there. Perhaps I too would have been led astray -- led to light the match beneath the witch's stake, if I didn't do my research. At this point, the analogy of the witch hunt is a tired trope, but unfortunately, it isn't any less real. After publishing my piece, I have received a number of irrational, abusive tweets from anonymous Twitter handles (with suspiciously low followers) saying, ""do your research"" or ""you're working for Knox's PR team."" These tweets would be amusing (trolls are like bad TV) if they weren't such a vivid representation of malignant ignorance. Sending batty tweets and writing parochial articles in the name of justice for Kercher's death is wrong. If you have a bone to pick and you're using abusive tactics, don't do it for the dead. Those that run anti-Knox sites -- whose misinformation clearly fed Nelson's righteous response -- host, as investigative journalist Nina Burleigh wrote, ""extremely active avatars, many proclaiming to be lawyers, forensic experts, criminologists, but who never reveal their true identities"" -- are even worse. While Nelson hasn't attacked me and has been only respectful, I take issue with her claims. She writes details false or circumstantial evidence and discusses defamation suits, as if it's shocking that Italy would sue the parents of the defendant. This doesn't mean defamation actually occurred; it means Italy is defensive; the courts want to prove they've done a good job. Nelson's article will appeal to those who either don't know much about the case or late-night online forum trolls.A telling digression: one of the more popular anti-Knox sites, TrueJustice.org, has been hit with some heavy cyber and sexual-assault allegations.  I've seen some of the comments on the site, and it seems a dangerous place to have discourse. I once tried registering for the forums on the site, but they wouldn't allow me, stating that I was dabbling in illegal activity by sharing my opinion of the Italian court system. Not a crime. They also published a piece which called me a ""faux feminist"" and claimed, ""A female's self-discipline in sexual matters is a hallmark of her personal self-respect and a sign she is able to envision her larger future as the wife of a dignified man."" If this is a site operating with ""justice"" in mind, there are some serious issues. Not least of which is their sexist and religious view on women's sexuality -- and their taking away of my feminism.I may have fallen down the rabbit hole, but only after doing my homework. I considered the defendants' guilt and possible involvement, of course, but it simply didn't add up. At the end of the day, I can understand the various points of view, insofar as I can understand those who doubt global warming. It's difficult to step out of one's comfort zone. It's difficult to accept that esteemed forensic experts, FBI agents, lawyers and journalists all believe in Knox and Sollecito's innocence. But why? What hate-filled feelings are many projecting onto these defendants? Why aren't we busier directing shock and anger at Rudy Guede's  reduced sentence? This is a shocking move, even for Italy. Sentence technicalities can't even be argued here, considering the judicial system's unreliable performance and shoddy handling of crime materials. I am, contrary to Nelson's claims, aware of those dog-tired points she touts to unknowing readers. But I know better, and most of that ""evidence"" was thrown out when the two were acquitted. When independent forensic analysts -- unaffiliated with the court -- found no real evidence, contaminated forensic samples, and no actual motive, that says something to me. The second conviction was all about scrutinizing a knife which was proven not to be the weapon and conjecture -- new motivation theories that couldn't possibly be proven. Nelson fails to recognize that only Rudy Guede broke in and assaulted and killed Kercher. Her belief is not entirely unique, but it's frustrating when it contributes to an imagined reality. Is it really too difficult for us to accept that this man -- with his mental instability and criminal background -- singularly overpowered her? His DNA was the only DNA in the bedroom, after all. This happens to women all the time. Nelson's cries of ""evidence"" are all traced back to the anti-Knox sites Burleigh details in her TIME Magazine piece. These twisted facts are as biased as they are dangerous.The DNA has never been there, and Nelson can't seriously argue that point. According to the New Scientist, ""Neither Sollecito's nor Knox's DNA was found on the remainder of the bra, other items of Kercher's clothing, objects collected from Kercher's room, or in samples from her body -- although Guede's DNA was found everywhere.""Andrew Gumbel, an award-winning English investigative reporter and foreign correspondent, summed up the recent trial's verdict in his May 2014 Guardian piece, ""Amanda Knox might get the retrial she deserves if anyone considers the facts."" Although Gumbel worked with Sollecito on his recent book, Honor Bound,  Gumbel still has 20 years of experience to back him up. Gumbel writes: Not only has Alessandro Nencini, the presiding judge of the Florence appeals court, apparently resorted to the same tortured logic as his predecessors; he has also stated things as fact that are manifestly and provably wrong.This case is startlingly simple, but the prosecution (and the looming influential forces from the first trial) continually force their theories onto the facts. Many observers have projected their fears and biases onto these public personas, complicating even the most obvious of scenarios. Beyond inaccurate information, Nelson grossly misinterpreted my most basic sentiments. I simply said that more feminists -- and feminist journalists -- should care about the Knox case.Nelson writes, ""Where, Basile wonders as she laments Knox's fate, are all the feminists? We're right here, Lisa. Basile's implication -- that those convinced of Knox's guilt do so because of gender prejudice -- is laughable. Not only does it demonstrate astonishing ignorance of the facts of this case, but Basile's entire article is suggestive of the role her own prejudice plays in forming her opinion of guilt or innocence.""How, I wonder, does Nelson somehow acknowledge the issue of slut-shaming but fail to reconcile how it has actually deformed the trial? It's as if she believes character assassination exists outside of the reality of the verdict. For Nelson, sexism is a bad, bad thing, but all that ""Foxy Knoxy"" talk she hates as much as I do couldn't possibly be a determining factor. When she agrees that sexism is bad but argues for the evidence, she has already lost. The evidence was determined by sexism and character assassination; the court very clearly twisted the scant information they had to fit their theory of the girl they hated. Nelson's claims make no sense. Lest I remind readers that Italy's jurors are not sequestered and one's character is put on trial; if I were a juror allowed to be influenced by the hundreds of newspaper and TV programs calling Knox a whore, drug-addict, seductress or sociopath, I might actually have been biased too. Unsurprisingly, it turns out the judges were biased as well. Gloria Steinem said, ""We need to remember across generations that there is as much to learn as there is to teach."" The case of Kercher's murder is built on and fed by puritanical, culturally judgmental mentalities. The first court case didn't teach anyone how to conduct a fair trial, and our latest judge clearly didn't learn much at all from those universally-recognized mistakes. Nelson writes, ""The vast majority of people who believe Knox is guilty do not figure her sexuality into their reasoning."" Anyone can Google the case (click the link -- I've done it for you) to know how untrue that is. Unfortunately, forensic science can't prove sexism or anti-Americanism or humanity lost in translation, but anyone with a brain and some working knowledge of society and culture can see the very real role these problems played.There has been quite a bit of tunnel vision around my article. Nelson and blogger Chelsea Hoffman  have been the most outspoken. Fortunately, they do so in a civil manner. The two suggest that I believe Knox is innocent simply because I'm a feminist. Their ideas (""how dare Basile allow Knox's PR spin, and her own wilful ignorance, to conceal that"") are assumptive and outright flawed. They present a sort of false dillema as it relates to this case, suggesting that feminism is to a belief in innocence as anti-feminism is to a belief in guilt. I spoke directly to the issue of feminism not because feminists have a bipartisan duty to support any woman -- guilty or innocent -- but because this case has such an anti-feminist undertone. They agree with that much. If I believed Knox to be guilty, as Nelson does, I would examine the sexism involved even then. However, I happen to believe that a) Knox is innocent and b) feminists have gone mysteriously quiet on Knox. The thread, for me, is that sexism and cultural bias did actually did have a determining factor in the prosecution's la-la-land theories. A feminist lens was simply the most obvious lens to look through when examining the case. Reporter Elizabeth Vargas spoke to this when she told Oprah that the first sexist allegations had a real impact on the case; ""they had cemented a sort of negative opinion of Amanda."" Readers can see how far down the pipeline this character assassination goes; the recent (and ridiculous) ""cocaine"" headlines are totally unfounded, all linking back to the early portraits of Knox as a druggy seductress. No college student is an angel, but these allegations are just unfounded. Nelson not only misinterpreted my thesis and my angle, she ignored whole sentences:Nelson writes, ""What Basile misses is the point that were Knox unattractive, let alone a minority or male, she would have a fraction of the support she has."" I am truly curious about this statement, considering I wrote, ""Perhaps we wouldn't even be talking about the Knox case if she wasn't white and beautiful. This world spins on a white, heteronormative, image-obsessed axis, as does the justice system."" Nelson also reduces my motives; she claims I wrote the piece because Knox was ""sexually active and good looking."" That is a gross oversimplification. I defend Knox and Sollecito because a social injustice -- of the highest order -- has gone on far too long.Feminism is not a weapon, and it can't be used against itself. Everyone deserves to be protected from misogyny and sexism. Nelson's headline, ""Why Feminists Owe Amanda Knox Nothing"" is a sad one indeed; guilty or innocent, if we don't examine the world around us and accept the possibility that long-standing social judgments do derail our justice systems, we will never affect change. Feminism is a simply a humanism.Judging by the amount of support that Knox and Sollecito have received, I have to believe in humanity. I have to believe that their innocence will prevail."
