0,POLITICS,Chuck Todd Questions The Wisdom Of Having Roger Ailes On The Trump Campaign,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chuck-todd-roger-ailes_us_57cee687e4b084e81ba34cff,"Mike Pence defends his boss: ""I trust Donald Trump's judgment.""",2016-09-06,"Chuck Todd offers GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence his best ""Are you <em>sure you're sure</em> about this"" face.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57cee84a1700002430c77dfd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week, I found myself wondering if anyone else had noticed that one of the recent additions to the campaign of GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump was this Roger Ailes fellow, who came to the Trump camp fresh from being forced out at Fox News amid allegations of sexually harassing numerous women in his employ over many years.“Hey, don’t hire this guy,” seemed to be a no-brainer to me, but I was feeling a little alone in that opinion.I needn’t have worried too much, it turns out. Nearly simultaneously, Slate’s Michelle Goldberg published a piece that also sought to point out the obvious ― that hiring Ailes under these circumstances was “not normal.” And over the weekend, NBC News’ Chuck Todd, during a “Meet The Press” interview with Republican vice presidential candidate Mike Pence, expressed the same sort of misgivings.Todd questioned the wisdom of hiring Ailes (as well as Breitbart News head Steve Bannon), given the “troubling allegations” swirling around him. Pence did his best to not appear too troubled by any of this.TODD: Quick question about the leadership of the campaign. There’s been some troubling allegations, both against Steve Bannon, some things he may have said about Jewish people, some things he may have ― happened between him and his wife. There’s been troubling allegations having to do with Roger Ailes, both of whom are apparently advisors to this campaign. Are you comfortable with that, considering some of the allegations you’ve read against both of these men? Are you comfortable with their involvement in this campaign?Since the “Meet The Press” interview, it has been reported that 21st Century Fox will offer Gretchen Carlson ― the “Fox & Friends” host whose accusations helped drive Ailes from his Fox News perch ― a $20 million settlement and an apology. The New York Times reports that Ailes is “responsible for a portion” of the Carlson settlement, and that Fox News is “in settlement talks with other women at the network.” In addition, Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren announced today that she will resign from the network ― a source tells New York magazine’s Gabriel Sherman that Van Susteren was “troubled by the culture” at Fox News, though additional reports suggest that she may have made her decision based upon a failed attempt to renegotiate her contract in the wake of Ailes’ departure.It’s also been reported that Ailes’ legal team ― taking a page from the Trump playbook ― plans on launching a counter-attack against Sherman, the reporter who, as Lloyd Grove describes, “spearheaded the reporting on [Ailes’] recent scandal.” Obviously, what the Trump campaign needs for the stretch run to Election Day is a new distraction.Of course, bringing Ailes into the fold at this point in time doesn’t make much sense if you want to concentrate on winning the presidential election, but it could be a shrewd move if, as some believe, the point of Trump’s presidential run is to scratch a new media empire out of the ruins. Hopefully Pence will find a home there, if they can manage it.~~~~~Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The boy’s remains were identified on Saturday, and the tireless advocates are now asking for help as they grieve.Jacob Wetterling was kidnapped at gunpoint in 1989 while riding his bicycle near his home in central Minnesota. The case captured national headlines, and the Wetterlings became vocal proponents for better protections for children, which helped lead to the national sex offender registry, according to NPR. Danny James Heinrich, 53, brought police to the boy’s remains on Saturday and confessed to the murder the following week. After authorities identified the 11-year-old’s remains, the Wetterlings released a statement saying they’re not yet ready to talk to the media. They also offered a list of simple things people can do to offer support.”The Wetterlings are deeply grieving and are pulling our family together,” Patty Wetterling said in a statement posted to the Jacob Wetterling Resource Center Facebook page. “Everyone wants to know what they can do to help us,” she added.Here are the things she suggested:Say a prayer. Light a candle. Be with friends. Play with your children. Giggle. Hold Hands. Eat ice cream. Create joy. Help your neighbor.“That is what will bring me comfort today,” she said.Authorities didn’t say where or how Jacob’s remains were found, but noted that the boy was identified through dental records. Last October, Danny James Heinrich was named a person of interest in the Wetterling case and authorities announced separate federal charges for child pornography, according to Reuters.In addition to pushing for legislation to protect against sex offenders, the Wetterlings have been advocating through their nonprofit, the Jacob Wetterling Resource Center. The organization works to educate families and communities to prevent the exploitation of children.“Our hearts are heavy, but we are being held up by all of the people who have been a part of making Jacob’s Hope a light that will never be extinguished,” the Wetterlings said in a statement on Saturday. “It shines on in a different way. We are, and we will continue to be, Jacob’s Hope. Jacob, you are loved.” Learn more about the Jacob Wetterling Resource Center here and donate to the organization through the widget below.

3,POLITICS,Ben Carson Continues To Be A Terrible Trump Surrogate,Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ben-carson-donald-trump-surrogate_us_57cf27e0e4b0a48094a6393b,"You do you, Ben.",2016-09-06,Retired neurosurgeon and former GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson sometimes has a hard time making the case for a Donald Trump presidency.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57cf28071700002430c77f6d.jpeg?cache=KtklhmjNG5&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As a surrogate for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Ben Carson’s job is to speak on behalf of his former rival and paint him in a positive light. But the gaffe-prone Carson, attempting to defend Trump’s endless waffling on immigration, suggested Tuesday that the GOP presidential nominee’s positions on the issue are “relatively irrelevant” because he is still learning.“It is what it is,” Carson told CNN’s Jake Tapper. “He is the nominee and has to come up with rational and workable plans, has to work with various advisers and experts in terms of the best way to do this, and it needs to be done in a fair and compassionate way that is consistent with the way we in America do things.”When Tapper asked Carson to clarify, the former GOP presidential candidate replied, “What you talk about during a campaign and what actually happens, as you know, in all administrations are different. You get different information, you learn things along the way, and you make adjustments along the way.”Carson, who endorsed Trump in March after losing to him in the Republican primary, does not always provide the best defense for the GOP nominee — and sometimes even makes things worse.Soon after providing his endorsement, Carson conceded that Trump was not, in his opinion, the best option for president.“Is there another scenario that I would have preferred? Yes — but that scenario isn’t available,” he told Newsmax TV. Still, Carson said he was fine with the outcome, because “we’re only looking at four years” of a Trump presidency.A month later, he stressed that Trump has “major defects.”“Are there better people? Probably,” Carson said.In some cases, Carson also inadvertently argues against Trump.On Tuesday, he said that Trump should “get all of the, you know, the hate and rancor out of the way” and apologize for his infamous claim that President Barack Obama was not born in the U.S.In March, when Trump angered both pro- and anti-abortion advocates by saying that women who get abortions should face “some form of punishment,” Carson suggested that Trump just wasn’t prepared for controversial questions.“Bear in mind, I don’t believe that [Trump] was warned that that question was coming, and I don’t think he really had a chance to really think about it,” he said.Sometimes, Carson makes his own headlines while trying to help Trump. Accompanying the GOP nominee on a visit to a predominantly black church in Carson’s hometown of Detroit on Saturday, he did a live TV interview, but awkwardly walked away to look for his luggage while still on camera.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Travis Rudolph, a wide receiver for Florida State’s Seminoles, first met Bo Paske when he visited the boy’s middle school on Aug. 30. Rudolph noticed the sixth grader eating lunch by himself and sat down at his empty table. Paske’s mother shared a photo of their meal on Facebook last week, and her post went viral.Days later, Rudolph again surprised the boy, who has autism, by personally presenting him with a custom jersey and two tickets to attend the Seminoles’ game Monday.“Bo, we want you to know that you will always be a special member of the Noles family,” Rudolph told Bo at their latest meeting.Here’s the photo of their first lunch together:And here they are meeting again:Asked by an ESPN reporter what kind of example he hoped to set, Rudolph replied, “That everybody is the same and everybody is great, regardless of whatever they’re going through.”Bo’s mother, Leah Paske, who was present at the reunion, previously said on Facebook that the image of the FSU player sitting with her son moved her to tears.“This is one day I didn’t have to worry if my sweet boy ate lunch alone, because he sat across from someone who is a hero in many eyes,” Bo’s mother wrote last week.Bo was photographed on Monday wearing his new jersey on the sidelines of the Seminoles’ game against the University of Mississippi’s Ole Miss Rebels. He even posed for a pic with ESPN broadcaster Samantha Ponder.During the game, Rudolph scored the team’s first touchdown of the 2016 season. The Noles ultimately won 45 to 34."

Over Labor Day weekend, 13 people were killed and 65 people were shot. The long, bloody weekend wasn’t an isolated occurrence. August marked the deadliest month in nearly 20 years with at least 90 homicides.Community members, including So Chi Voices, say that despite the violence they’re being ignored by local authorities which is why the collective is so important in helping them to lift their voices.“Chicago-based So Chi Voices is a musical movement,” co-founder Julie Nichols said in a statement to The Huffington Post. “[We’re] a collective of artists committed to uplifting our community through music. This vibrant musical collective originally came together in 2015 in response to Chicago’s rising and ignored senseless violence. Our mission is to introduce progressive change and positivity to the community, turning pain into purpose.”While shining a light on the violence that plagues their city, So Chi Voices aims to uplift through lyrics filled with hope which can be heard in their song “See Another Day.”One emcee raps in the song:“Down here, feel like nobody cares. We still marching for victory while Rahm ignores our bloody tears. Everyday, we try to switch the gears. But it’s hard to stay up, when they keep burning down the stairs.” Though a song can’t bring back the more than 500 lives lost this year in the city to gun violence, So Chi Voices praises Chicago residents for their resilience and offers a much-needed song of healing.

6,POLITICS,Harry Reid Vows To Jam Up Committee Meetings Until GOP Moves On Supreme Court Vacancy (UPDATE),Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/merrick-garland-scotus_us_57cf3054e4b06a74c9f15393,Democrats are renewing their push for Merrick Garland's Supreme Court nomination.,2016-09-06,Merrick Garland has been waiting more than 170 days for a hearing on his Supreme Court nomination.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57cf3121170000f92dc77fa9.jpeg?cache=SSF6NxZ9E4&ops=crop_0_126_3000_1794%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Going on vacation doesn’t make all your problems go away, as Congress will find out as it returns from its seven-week break. The budget is still set to run out, Zika is still spreading and the Supreme Court is still missing a ninth justice. And on Wednesday, supporters of Merrick Garland will make sure that the public remembers Congress has work to do as senators try to awkwardly look the other way.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) took to the floor Tuesday morning and said Democrats will prevent committees from fully functioning until Republicans agree to move forward on Garland:To show the American people’s absolute disgust with how Republicans have treated Merrick Garland’s nomination, starting today, I’m objecting to committees meeting for other purposes until the Judiciary Committee schedules a meeting to consider Judge Garland’s nomination.As The Hill notes, Senate rules require unanimous consent for committees to meet after the Senate has been in session for two hours or after 2 p.m. That consent is normally granted without any controversy. So Reid won’t be able to block all committees from meeting, but he will be able to significantly restrict the time in which they can do so.“Hard to complain about obstruction or things not getting passed or nominees not being confirmed when you’re slowing down the work of the committees though, right?” said Don Stewart, spokesman of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). “And it inconveniences the Democrat members of the committee just as much as Republicans; Democrat-called witnesses as much as GOP.”“It’s not an effective or sustainable position,” he added. President Barack Obama first nominated Merrick Garland, the chief judge of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, to the Supreme Court on March 16. Garland still has not received any hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Republicans have vowed to block him not because of his qualifications but because they say Obama shouldn’t get to choose the replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia. They instead want the next president to choose, hoping that Donald Trump wins the election. Garland now has the unfortunate distinction of being the Supreme Court nominee who has gone the longest without a hearing. A group of Garland’s former clerks will hold a press conference Wednesday morning at the Supreme Court, pressing for a vote. The event is organized by We Need Nine, an advocacy group pushing for Garland’s nomination.The clerks will then hold meetings on the Hill, including with the offices of Sens. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.). Sen. Kelly Ayotte’s (R-N.H.) office declined to meet with them. Her spokesperson did not return a request for comment.The events will be part of an effort to renew the push for Garland, even as Republicans like Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), who chairs the Judiciary Committee, say they won’t budge on giving him a vote. McConnell “has been crystal clear for the last seven months,” an aide to the senator told Reuters. “The next president will select the nominee.”This sort of political obstinance is sad and frustrating to Garland’s former clerks, who say they can’t imagine someone more qualified to be a justice. They will try to show Wednesday why those who know the judge best believe this is such an important issue. Temple University law professor Craig Green, who clerked for Garland from 2000-2001, called the delay “dangerous and disgraceful.”“I think you can expect the Garland nomination to be brought up in any future scenario in the fourth year of a presidency not to confirm a justice for purely partisan reasons,” Green predicted. “Again, the thing I just keep coming back to is, you never need a Supreme Court until you do.”“He’s just not getting a fair hearing and an opportunity for the American people to hear more about his story, to hear him answer any questions that senators may have,” added David Zionts, who clerked for Garland from 2008-2009 and is now a lawyer at Covington and Burling. “It’s unfortunate that someone who has given back so much to the country and who has really been a model judge can’t get a hearing on the merits and can’t have his record considered on its own.”Garland has engendered deep loyalty from his clerks. Sixty-eight of his former clerks signed a letter in April urging the Senate to confirm him. The only three who withheld their signature did so because they’re currently clerks for Supreme Court justices. Erin Murphy, a law professor at New York University who clerked for Garland from 1999-2000 and helped organize the clerks’ letter, said the judge goes above and beyond in mentoring the people who work for them, keeping in touch and hosting an annual reunion for all the clerks at his house. She rescheduled the class she teaches Wednesday in order to travel to Washington to help her former boss. “In his professional career, his good judgment is evident, [as are] his thoughtfulness and his carefulness and his care and his humanity, but it’s also true for his personal judgment,” she said. “So a lot of us look up to him as someone who’s made the kind of life for himself that we aspire to both personally and professionally.”All three clerks couldn’t believe that a man who has worked so hard to separate himself from politics has been caught up in this firestorm. Garland is widely known as a moderate, centrist judge ― which was a bit of a disappointment to some progressives who were hoping Obama would nominate someone more to the left.Green said he remembered Garland as one of the only people he knew not rooting for a side when the Supreme Court was deciding Bush v. Gore after the 2000 elections. “He was as attentive as the rest of us,” Green said, “but it didn’t really strike me until later that he didn’t follow it with the same sort of attitude that I and most everybody I knew followed it with ― that kind of rooting interest.”“To see a judge who we know embodies all of the best values of the judicial branch ― the impartiality, the deep respect for the constitution, the deep respect for the rule of law, the commitment to those principles above all other things ― to see him dragged into this kind of muck,” Murphy added, “is heartbreaking.”UPDATE: 10:25 p.m. ― The Reid announcement was already having an effect Tuesday night. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee announced that its hearing on the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty originally scheduled for 2:30 p.m. Wednesday would now be at 10:00 a.m. A spokesman confirmed they moved it because of Reid’s new policy.UPDATE: Sept. 7 ― Reid is no longer holding up committee hearings. His office said “it had the intended effect ― it got McConnell’s attention and McConnell is now offering us paths forward on our priorities. We’ll take it on a case by case basis moving forward.”Reid also told reporters Wednesday, “Quite frankly we kind ofgot what we wanted. ... We wanted to make sure we got something on Zika. We’ve been given that, McConnell’s word, that’s what he’s going to do.”Republicans have not yet budged on giving Garland a hearing."

After pooling the results, Ahmadizar and colleagues found an increased risk of eczema due to early life use of antibiotics of 15 to 41 percent, while hay fever risk increased by 14 to 56 percent.The association with allergies was stronger if patients received more than one course of antibiotics early in life.Adam Finn, a professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol, who was not involved in the research, said the findings added weight to evidence of long-term downside from antibiotic use. Medics are already worried about the emergence of antibiotic resistance due to drug over-use.Still, Finn and other experts said doctors needed to balance out the risks and benefits, since antibiotics remain essential weapons in fighting bacterial infections, saving millions of lives."

In a dashcam video released last year, Tiller can be seen approaching the car and, seconds later, firing into the driver’s side window as Hammond attempts to flee. Tiller claimed Hammond was attempting to run him over and he feared for his life. He has remained on paid administrative leave since the shooting and hasn’t returned to duty of any kind, Covington said.“For reasons not provided although speculation is abound, Chief Covington made the admirable decision to terminate Lt. Tiller’s employment,” the Hammond family said in a statement released through their attorney, Eric Bland. “For that we all are grateful and we want to let Chief Covington know that we appreciate his decision. With each passing day the Hammonds never lost hope that Lt. Tiller would in the future never again have the highest honor of serving the public as a police officer, wear the uniform and carry a weapon.”The Hammond family described Tiller as a “rogue” officer whose actions resulted in the “senseless death” of their son.Hammond’s death last year became part of the nationwide debate over law enforcement’s use of deadly force. It elicited a response from activists with the Black Lives Matter movement, who said the incident spoke to the transracial nature of their concerns. Others called attention to the fact that the shooting began with a botched undercover marijuana sting that had targeted the passenger in Hammond’s vehicle. Hammond’s passenger was suspected of carrying only $60 worth of marijuana, Bland said in a statement.Hammond’s attorneys and law enforcement officials also sparred over the details of the incident, which ended with Tiller shooting Hammond twice at close range. The video shows Tiller approaching the vehicle with his gun drawn, before ordering Hammond to get out of his car. When Hammond’s car backs up and begins to drive forward, Tiller runs toward the front of the car. By the time Tiller opens fire, the video shows him standing to the side of the car.Although a state prosecutor determined that Tiller did not violate the law when he fired two shots at Hammond’s moving vehicle as the teen attempted to flee, the city of Seneca settled the suit with the Hammond family for $2.1 million in March.Warning: The video below may be upsetting to some viewers.The Hammond family suit against Tiller and the Seneca Police Department made a series of deeply troubling accusations against Tiller and the other officers who responded to the fatal shooting. The suit alleged that officers were disrespectful to Hammond’s body and were seen celebrating. One officer raised Hammond’s lifeless hand and gave it a “celebratory high-five,” the lawsuit charged.While cleared of criminal wrongdoing at the state level, Tiller remains under federal investigation by the Department of Justice for a possible civil rights violation.“[A]ll lives matter and it is an injustice to each and every American when an officer-related shooting is not handled with sensitivity and absolute transparency,” the family’s statement reads. “Regardless of what the future holds for Lt. Tiller and others associated with the death of Zachary Hammond, the Hammonds offer their thanks and prayers to the brave men and women in blue.”"

But Trump’s proposal to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border as well as his comments calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals drove the baseball player, nicknamed “Big Papi,” to speak out.“When you speak like that about us, it’s a slap in the face,” said Ortiz, who plans to retire at the end of this season. “I walk around sometimes, and I see Mexican people trying to earn a living in an honest way. And to hear somebody make those kinds of comments, it hits you. I think as Latin people we deserve better. Things have gotten much better in that regard. … As Latin people we deserve respect, no matter where you’re from. And especially our Mexican brothers, who come here willing to do all the dirty work.”Ortiz, who was born in the Dominican Republic, debuted in the major leagues in 1997 and became a U.S. citizen in 2008.The baseball icon predicted to USA Today that candidates who are anti-immigrant would lose.“Latin people here in the United States are the spark plug of the country’s economy. Whoever opposes that is going to lose. And not just Latin people, but immigrants,” Ortiz said. “I’m talking about people who come from Africa, from Asia, other places. All those people come here with one goal, to realize the American dream, and you have to include them in our group.”Trump has frequently tried to use sports figures to boost his candidacy. He boasted about his friendship with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady (though Brady has stopped short of a full-throated endorsement) and touted support from former Indiana University basketball coach Bobby Knight and former Yankees player Paul O’Neill, among others.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
10,ENTERTAINMENT,13 More Women Could Testify Against Bill Cosby In His Criminal Trial,Michael McLaughlin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-cosby-trial-13-women-accusers_us_57cf256fe4b03d2d4596f7cc,They'd make the case that he had a pattern of sexual assault.,2016-09-06,Andrea Constand accuses Bill Cosby of drugging and molesting her in 2004.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57cf3884160000ef1bc00faf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As many as 13 other women accusing Bill Cosby of sexual abuse may testify against him in the upcoming criminal trial that alleges he assaulted Andrea Constand in 2004. Prosecutors from the Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, district attorney’s office said they were filing a motion to admit the additional witnesses at a pretrial hearing on Tuesday. At the same hearing, Judge Steven O’Neill set a date of June 5, 2017, to begin the 79-year-old comedian’s trial on three counts of aggravated indecent assault. Like Constand, the 13 women say they were drugged or intoxicated when Cosby allegedly assaulted them, according to the Associated Press. The women ― who were not named in the motion ― were selected from a list of roughly 50 alleged victims that prosecutors reviewed. It’s likely that Cosby’s attorneys will try to prevent the women from testifying. Judge O’Neill did not immediately rule on the motion.Outside the courthouse, Cosby’s lawyers argued that the African-American star is a victim of racism. One likened his situation to that of black men shot by police. “For Mr. Cosby, this is a version of the ‘shoot now, ask questions later’ approach to judicial justice that you’re seeing in the streets,” said Angela Agrusa, according to NBC News.Constand, who met Cosby when she was working for Temple University, has said that he molested her in his suburban Philadelphia home. She visited him to discuss her career, she said, but became disoriented after he gave her wine and pills. Then he allegedly fondled her breasts and penetrated her with his fingers.The physical encounter was consensual, according to Cosby, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges. On Tuesday, the lawyers also argued over whether a 2005 phone call between Cosby and Constand’s mother, Gianna, could be used as evidence.The defense wants to block introduction of the recorded call in which Cosby offered money to pay for Constand’s therapy, graduate school and moving expenses. They contend that it’s inadmissible because Gianna Constand made the recording without obtaining Cosby’s permission as required by Pennsylvania state law ― though neither party was in Pennsylvania at the time. Cosby asked if he was being taped when he heard a beep, according to a transcript of the call. She said no and claimed the sound was a parrot.Judge O’Neill listened to the low-quality recording in court, but did not make any decision. BuzzFeed reported that Cosby’s voice was at times inaudible on the tape. In other pretrial maneuvering, the defense said it will file a motion seeking to move the trial outside the county on the grounds that District Attorney Kevin Steele turned the Cosby allegations into a campaign issue during his election last year.

Rights groups and politicians have routinely criticized him for his controversial statements, including saying he wanted to join in a gang rape of an Australian missionary and threatening mass killings of drug dealers. On Tuesday, he told militants in the country, “I will eat you in front of people.”But of all the threats and insults that Duterte has hurled against his critics and perceived opponents, his go-to appears to be calling people sons of whores. He has commonly used “putang ina,” which translates from the Tagalog language as “son of a whore” or “son of a bitch,” to describe figures ranging from drug dealers to world leaders. Although Duterte issued an apology of sorts for using the term to describe Obama, most other targets haven’t received the same treatment. Duterte still has not taken back calling U.S. Ambassador Philip Goldberg “gay” and a “son of a whore” last month. He also never apologized for calling former President Benigno Aquino III a “son of a whore” during the election campaign, after Aquino criticized Duterte by asking voters to remember how Adolf Hitler came to power.Duterte has drawn comparisons to GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump for using offensive rhetoric and branding himself as a political outsider.

The pope’s apparent offense was causing traffic jams during a papal visit last year in Davao City, where Duterte was the mayor at the time.

The tough talk and harsh rhetoric merely reinforce Duterte supporters’ view that the president has the boldness needed to tackle these issues. A July poll showed Duterte’s popularity rating at 91 percent, despite the controversies surrounding him, which included the beginning of a huge surge in extrajudicial killings of alleged drug dealers and users since he was elected. At least 1,900 people have been killed since Duterte began his drug war, according to the Philippines’ head of police."

With just months left in Obama’s term, Senate Republicans have all but stopped confirming his judicial picks.But the nomination carries a symbolic value: It lands in the midst of a chaotic presidential campaign in which GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has said that a Muslim federal judge wouldn’t treat him fairly because of his calls for banning Muslims from entering the country. Trump made similarly bigoted charges that a Latino federal judge would be biased against him because he has advocated for building a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.Muslim advocates hailed Qureshi’s nomination.“I commend President Obama for taking this important step in continuing to pick the best and brightest from every community to serve as part of our nation’s judiciary,” said Farhana Khera, executive director of Muslim Advocates, a legal advocacy organization. “A judiciary that reflects the rich diversity of our nation helps ensure the fair and just administration of the law, and it is vital for American Muslims to be included. Mr. Qureshi’s profound commitment to the rule of law and justice for people of all backgrounds makes him an exceptional nominee.”It’s not necessarily a dead end for Qureshi. There’s always a chance his nomination could move in the lame duck Congress, when chaos tends to erupt. And if Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wins in November, she could very well re-nominate him to the same seat in 2017. There have been rumblings about Qureshi’s nomination for months. He is currently a partner in the Washington D.C. office of Latham & Watkins LLP. "

I walked most of the way, but in order to get to Switzerland I took a boat, a plane and a train, as well. I wasn't able to take much with me besides the clothes I had on. Since I had to leave my family behind, these photos were the only things that were important to me, and luckily I could carry them on me. On the photos you can see my parents, my brother and my sister -- who's not deceased."" -- Vinasithamby, 64, fled from Sri Lanka in 1984",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c99f08180000b429bcee18.jpeg?ops=scalefit_1280_noupscale,"Last year, a heartbreaking image was captured and circulated, causing news outlets to investigate its subject and artists to respond to its tragic implications. The image shows a toddler who had washed up on the coast of Turkey ― drowned, apparently, while trying to escape Syria with his family.The photo is striking for a number of reasons. Unlike other powerful, war-related images, there’s no violence depicted. But the boy’s vulnerable position, and his small shoes, underscore the tragedy. It’s a sad picture that draws a hard line between the viewer’s and the refugee’s experience.Gabriel Hill, a Swiss photographer whose work aims to provide an alternative to this sort of gritty imagery, pointed out that the image resonated so much with viewers because we all learned the boy had a name: Aylan Kurdi. “No matter how you think about refugees in general, this made people sad because this little boy could have been [anyone’s] little brother or child,” Hill told The Huffington Post.Hill has devoted much of his artistic energies to taking portraits of refugees. His aim, he said, is to illuminate those individuals’ experiences and make it difficult for viewers to hold onto generalizations.“There are millions of images and portraits of refugees, but usually very dramatic ones, with dirty clothes in a refugee camp and mostly one doesn’t know who this person is. For sure it’s important to show the world how they have to live in the camps or how they travel for documentary reasons but sometimes I feel the photographers ‘catch’ them in their most horrible moment,” Hill said. “Exhausted, scared, naked. They don’t have a chance to say if they want their image shown to the world.”To add another perspective to the steady cycle of tragic realities, Hill decided to take his own portraits of refugees, capturing their strong expressions to paint them as survivors. Over the course of one year, he interviewed refugees about their most prized possessions ― what they brought with them from their homes, be it something practical, like a cell phone, or something sentimental, like a family photo. The series is called “ImPORTRAITS.”The breadth of items shows that some of the subjects had to flee their homes in a rush, while others could be more deliberate about their exits. Regardless, the portraits communicate something about the strength of remembering your roots. They also show that, for some of the subjects, survival took precedent over emotion. “Once you see my portraits, your next thought is most probably, ‘What would I take with me if I have to leave my home and my country?’” Hill said. “For a fraction of a moment you are in exact the same situation as the ‘refugee’ was.”"

Reuters reviewed donations made during the 2016 election cycle by political action committees of the 30 biggest publicly traded U.S. companies that signed Obama’s “American Business Action on Climate Change Pledge.” The 2015 commitment, signed by 154 companies, served as a public promise by large businesses to push for environmentally friendly policies and to support strong climate action like the historic accord reached in Paris last December.During the period reviewed by Reuters, two companies ― PepsiCo and the chemical giant DuPont ― doled out half or more of their political spending to the campaigns of more than 130 congressional lawmakers listed as “climate deniers” by Organizing For Action, a Democratic-leaning nonprofit founded by former Obama staffers. Google, AT&T, General Electric, Verizon and Mondelez gave more than a third of their political donations to candidates, almost all of them Republicans, on that list, Reuters found.

Despite overwhelming scientific evidence, members of the party ― particularly those with backing from the fossil fuel industries, like coal and oil ― have denied the role of human activity in causing global temperatures to rise. Obama has slammed Republicans for being “the only major party that I can think of in the advanced world that effectively denies climate change.” That has produced a schism between some big businesses and the party that claims to represent their interests.Last September, an unlikely coalition of companies ― including Goldman Sachs, Starbucks, Johnson & Johnson and Walmart ― committed to using 100 percent renewable energy within a decade.Corporate purchases of clean energy skyrocketed last year ahead of the Paris treaty, which was formally ratified last week by China’s parliament. This was particularly true among companies that had never bought renewable power before. Of the more than 20 corporate giants that inked major renewable energy deals last year, 15 of them were first-time buyers, accounting for 67 percent of the market, according to a report by the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute.Still, the tension between certain companies’ political spending and their stated environmental values is sometimes hard to ignore. In June, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) wrote an op-ed lambasting companies for failing to lobby on behalf of climate-friendly policies. He criticized firms like PepsiCo for remaining part of trade associations that fail to acknowledge climate change, or that even deny its risks outright.“Washington’s dirty secret is that even the American companies that are really good on sustainability put net zero effort into lobbying Congress on climate change,” he wrote in Forbes. “We are far closer to getting something big done on climate in Congress than most people think, but the good guys in the corporate sector have to start showing up.”But there may be cause for optimism, according to Anne Kelly, a senior program director at the nonprofit Ceres, which pushes investors and companies to take environmental risk and sustainability seriously.By backing candidates who question the science behind climate change, some companies could gain influence over those candidates and sway them to more climate-friendly positions, Kelly said.“Our hope is that by funding certain lawmakers whose positions on climate and energy do not match the companies’ positions, they’re actually encouraging those lawmakers to evolve and giving them cover,” Kelly told HuffPost on Tuesday. “We understand that lawmaking is complicated and [companies] may need the support of those people for other issues that may have nothing to do with climate or energy, though that’s not an excuse.”"

The nanoparticles are a form of iron oxide called magnetite. In the study, published Sep. 5 in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found millions of magnetite particles in a gram of brain tissue. Taking a closer look at these particles, they found striking similarities to airborne magnetite, said study author Barbara Maher, a scientist at the University of Lancaster. “When we looked at the particles inside the brain, they were a match point for point with these magnetite particles that we see in the airborne pollution,” Maher told The Huffington Post. Magnetite particles in the air are formed in high temperatures during combustion.“We think what’s happening is that when you breathe these particles, they are small enough that they can travel up the nose and reach the brain through the olfactory bulb,” Maher said.That route to the brain is one of the few that’s not protected by the blood-brain barrier, which normally restricts foreign particles in the blood from reaching the brain. Several previous studies have suggested a link between Alzheimer’s and high levels of magnetite. The compound was thought to be naturally formed in the brain and crystallized in angular shapes. The new study, however, found a lot of iron particles have different characteristics.“They are rounded, matching the molten droplet shape that pollution particles generally take,” Maher said. The particles were variable in size, measuring between 10 and 150 nanometers (one-billionth of a meter) in diameter. And they occur with other foreign metal particles, such as platinum and nickel. “It’s difficult to imagine how they would be forming inside the brain.”“The recognition that nanoparticles of industrially-generated magnetite are able to make their way into the brain tissues is disturbing,” Joseph Kirschink of CalTech, who wasn’t involved in the new study, told Newsweek. In 1992, Kirschink and his colleagues discovered that magnetite can be found inside the brain. As an environmental scientist, Maher had been been looking at magnetic properties of air pollution in the roadside atmosphere. “It’s clear that there are abundant magnetite nanoparticles that occur as part of the urban pollution mix,” Maher said. “We use those magnetic properties to measure how much atmospheric pollution there is at different places across the city.” She then became aware of studies suggesting that brains of people with Alzheimer’s contained more magnetite than the brains of healthy people. A 2013 study from UCLA, for example, found higher levels of iron in the brains of 31 people with Alzheimer’s compared with 68 healthy people. For that study, the researchers focused on the hippocampus, a part of the brain involved in memory formation, which shows signs of damage early in the disease.“The magnetite was thought to be damaging to the brain,” Maher said. “So I began to wonder about the magnetite in urban pollution. Was that able to get into the brain?”Maher and her colleagues looked at brain tissue samples from the frontal cortex of 37 people who had lived in Mexico City and Manchester.Among those in Manchester, the analysis showed a higher concentration of magnetite in people who were older than 65 when they died, especially those with severe to moderate Alzheimer’s. But younger people who were exposed to high levels of air pollution in Mexico City also showed high concentrations. The highest brain magnetite content was found in a 32-year-old Mexico City resident.Although several studies have found higher levels of iron in various brain areas of people with Alzheimer’s, it’s not fully known how iron is involved in the disease. The hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease is the accumulation of amyloid plaques between nerve cells, and a study published earlier this year found magnetite particles inside these plaques.Maher and her team plan next to look directly at the toxicity of these magnetite particles by studying their effects on cells grown in the lab. Another topic requiring further investigation is whether people living in suburban areas carry lower levels of the particles. This, however, will be difficult to show, because even those people could be exposed to pollution from open fires and various other sources, Maher said. The particles are so small that wearing a mask is unlikely to be useful. To avoid getting a magnetic load from air pollution, the best option when commuting is to avoid highly polluted areas, said Maher, who tries planning her route through a park or back streets when possible. Avoiding the curb might also be a good idea, she said. “The amount of pollution drops off rapidly farther from the curbside.”And trees may help too. In another study, researchers showed that planting trees on the curbside considerably reduces particulates from the indoor environment of houses."

On Saturday, West tweeted a casting call for his Yeezey Season 4 New York Fashion Week show, set to take place in Manhattan Wednesday. The call was very specific in its ask for “multiracial women only.” The rapper, who is also currently performing his Saint Pablo tour at Madison Square Garden, received a flurry of responses criticizing the move. Women’s Wear Daily reported that more than 500 modeling hopefuls showed up for their chance to make it into Yeezy’s show. And they didn’t seem to think he was being exclusionary. “He’s so different from everyone else,” one 18-year-old told WWD. “I just think this is such an interesting show. I feel like any girl could do it, whether you’re six feet tall size zero, or size four. There’s just an opportunity with him.”"

And trolls are ruining the public debate on the open internet. And Facebook is swallowing all of it into its walled gardens.***It’s been an epic summer holiday, but now it’s over. Even in France.And while everybody has been away from the screens, sort of, some one else has been busy. Like they say, when the cat is away mice will play. Or, in this case, trolls.We’ve heard of them before, but as the world gets more and more digital and online, more people and companies get a taste of these creatures. Even in the physical world, we see more trolling. Globalization is speeding up and the political divide seems to grow all around the world with the Brexit, war lords around Syria and the Donald in America. Some even say Trump is the greatest troll of all time. We can’t prove it, but a good guess is that a cocktail of technology giving an unfiltered microphone to everyone, and the spread of internet access is part of the reason.According to Jonathan Zittrain, trolls just see the internet as a place to play a game of provocation in order to get a reaction that again can escalate in to another reaction ― and so on and so on ― until Godwin’s law dictates that someone throws in a comparison to nazis or Hitler. And that trash talk can even spiral into conflicts, and even violence, in the real world.So it’s the year of trolling it seems. As everything is heating up, people are increasingly giving up on the culture of commenting on the internet. TIME Magazine even said the trolls already ruined the internet. That’s probably a little too steep, but some places are definitely having a hard time dealing with it.Twitter is one of the most prominent social media platforms that is getting a lot of heat for not being that “social.” Celebrities are flocking away from the service because of the so called trolls and Twitter is desperately trying to figure out a way of calming down the public.But they are not making it easier on themselves when Twitter officials say wishing rape on a woman doesn’t count as harassment.In the old world, there is also some serious scrambling. Just like anyone else with a heavy past, legacy media is in trouble finding its way. In the age of the two-way-communications medium, the internet as the fourth estate is moving away from the old institutions of the very hard-defined channels as print and tv over to the wicked liquid ways of the online world. Some media platforms are leaving behind the comments all together and thus leaving public debate to the non-edited and non-curated social media mecca.So what used to be an important part of the newspaper industry — being the hub for public opinion and debate — is now left to the unattended public on the very same new media platforms that are eating away the advertising budgets that used to go to old media. Could there be a connection?Andrew Losowsky who’s in charge of The Coral Project puts it this way:Social media platforms control the tools, the relationship, the information and the access — all of the things that newsrooms need to own themselves in order to sustain a meaningful relationship beyond a single tweet or Facebook reply. The unit of measurement is not the comment — it’s the commenter.Margarat Sullivan of The Washington Post disagrees on abandoning the comments on media sites and leaving it to social media to host the open debates. Everyone seems to hate online reader comments, she writes. Here’s why she treasures them.Legacy media is by and large scrambling with a lot things. Venerable The Economist has always been published without author bylines in print and claimed that particular feature was essential. But as they increasingly get sucked in by social media, it now seams almost impossible not to have a verified person to step forward. What will that mean for trolling — more real people to harass or more real people to take on the anonymous?The other extreme will then be Facebook where probably most public debate is taking place now. But that comes with a price on free speech or expression it seams as the network just banned a drawing of a hand by Renaissance master Holbein.The hand is back up again after fans posted more hands in protest. The network then blamed “human error” of the censorship.So art is not top of mind for the humans at Facebook. And maybe real people aren’t either as Facebook just fired the team curating the trending topics feature in the ever expanding ecosystem. Now it’s all up to the machines. But that shouldn’t fool you into thinking that Facebook is a technology company. They are not. In fact they are a media company. Only in a very 21st century kind of way, we hear.By the way. While you were reading this and clicking on the links to read, even more we’ve noticed a huge amount of activity on Facebook. Trolls or not take a look.And trolls are not only a thing of the comments threads. Also in the high production value chain of content we see more of it. Advertisers are increasingly trolling the traditional content producers and publishers with commercial content or native advertising as it’s sometimes called. Well, content can sometimes be a hidden commercial but commercials can sometimes be brilliant content. Content or commercial — Spike Jonze just trolled the music industry with an advertisement better than most music video.For daily perspectives, rants thoughts & ideas you should follow the Trouble people on Facebook.

I had searched for the archetypal magical world of the 1001 Arabian Nights, “The Thief of Baghdad,” the magic carpets, the mysterious towns with narrow streets, the noisy colorful bazaars, the Muslim chants and unfamiliar music. I had searched in the heart of Asia (Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Iran), in the Near East (Egypt, Syria, Lebanon), on the Arabian Peninsula (Emirates, Oman). Nothing. In Central Asia the communist era has destroyed all elements of the traditional past, forcing a homogenization of all its cultures. Iran was given a double blow: first by the Shah with his Westernization, and then by the Ayatollahs with their fanatic Islamization, which left almost nothing of the old standing. The old Persian towns of Kashan and Yazd are faint reflections of their glorious past.

However, just as I was about to depart from the region where the old Arabian civilization once flourished, at the Westernmost tip of Africa I discovered the only country that has preserved a big part of the old Arabian world intact: Morocco. Ironically, Morocco is the least “Arab” of the Arab countries, due to its strong indigenous Berber culture, and the modern French and cosmopolitan influences. Yet, the Moroccans have managed to navigate masterfully through all influences, and to modernize without losing their soul. No other Arab country can claim as many well-preserved medieval towns as Morocco. Marrakesh, Essaouira, Meknes, Sefrou, Chefchaouen, to name the ones that stand out, are incredible towns, each with its own unique Moroccan character. But above all of these town-jewels, there is one city that keeps alive the magical world of our imagination. Sitting alone on its royal throne, it is the Queen of all medieval cities, the true heir of the 1001 Arabian Nights: Fez. Fes el Bali, the Medina or old town of Fez, is the most fascinating and enchanting town of both the Arab World and the African continent. Built in the 8th century C.E., Fez was the capital of Morocco until 1912. Boasting the oldest continuously operating university in the world, Al Quaraouiyine, which was founded in 859 C.E., Fez has been the cultural, social, and spiritual heart of Morocco for centuries. Today, the old town of Fez is the only accessible authentically preserved living medieval city in the world. It is living, because unlike most other medieval cities, it is not artificially maintained just for tourists. Encircled by high walls stretching for eight kilometers, the Medina’s inhabitants live a normal life and work there, preserving their centuries-old crafts and skills. And although many modern comforts and amenities, like electricity and mobile phones, are of course present, the rhythm and pace of the city is the same as it has been for many centuries. This is helped by the fact that the Medina is the largest car-free pedestrian area on the planet, and it is also much less touristy than the other great towns of Morocco. You need not read anything about Fez beforehand. You need no map, no list of sites. For there is only one way to explore it: enter Fez through its magnificent blue gate, get lost in its labyrinth-like alleyways, and allow it to consume, absorb, and assimilate you.As you meander under a hundred series of arches, just observe the women filling their jugs with water at the communal fountains, the faithful taking off their slippers before entering the mosque for prayer, the children playing in the narrow streets. Walk along the covered markets, the wonderful squares, pass through the metal-workers’ quarter, the baboush slippers quarter, the fabric market, the legendary tanneries. Admire the interlaced blue glazed tiles and intricate woodwork adorning the buildings’ façades. Step into hidden basements to see stained glass lanterns and bronze chandeliers, and enter into the grand multi-storied riads to finally discover your own Arabian magic carpet! And make your walk “a long one” so that “with what pleasure, what joy!” you may stop…“to buy fine things, mother of pearl and coral, amber and ebony, sensual perfume of every kind— as many sensual perfumes as you can”… as Cavafy says in his immortal poem “Ithaca,” which alludes to this Arabia of the imagination. Cavafy’s deliberate focus on smells actually touches the heart of hearts of Fez. For nothing moves the visitor’s soul as strongly as the mixture of Fez’s disparate smells that constantly change and recombine as one meanders, creating a ceaseless stream of sensual phantasmagoria: the smell of worked leather mixed with that of oxtail brewed in casserole, or the smell of freshly laundered shirts drying in the sun combined with the refined scents of mint tea enjoyed by old men in jelabiahs. The smells, but also the sounds of Fez: the merchants’ voices, the butchers’ commanding shouts, the clanking of large metal bowls carried by donkeys, the muezzin’s repeated calls for prayer. Smells and sounds are what in the end conquer the visitor, who, as Cavafy suggests in his poem, ends up postponing forever the return to his lodging, subconsciously pretending to lose his way back.Fez is the archetypal Arabian city of our childhood imagination.And, surprisingly, it actually exists.Nicos Hadjicostis is a writer and world-traveler.

Chesley Sullenberger, who flew into a flock of geese in 2009 and through quick thinking, years of experience and nerves of steel, managed to safely ditch his dead-engine Airbus A320 into the Hudson River, saving all aboard.And there is Juliane Koepcke, who in 1971, at age 17, fell 10,000 feet to earth after her plane was struck by lightening and then ripped asunder by a particularly violent storm over Peru. Strapped to a row of chairs, she “helicoptered” into the Amazonian rainforest, the jungle canopy breaking her fall, after which she walked for ten days before encountering some lumbermen who canoed her back to civilization.But for my money, the most remarkable of all may be that of my uncle Don Harten, who as a young lieutenant co-pilot on June 18, 1965, managed to survive a head-on collision at 30,000 feet between two bomb- and fuel-laden B-52s, each about the size of a 747 and each traveling about 500 mph, during a nighttime aerial refueling maneuver above the South China Sea.Harten was on the venerable B-52’s inaugural bombing mission, a 5,000-mile round trip from Andersen Air Base, Guam, to what was described as a Vietcong jungle stronghold 28 miles northwest of Saigon (though it would later turn out to be an abandoned Michelin rubber plantation devoid of any enemy activity whatsoever – a portent of things to come in the Vietnam War if there ever were one.) Traveling in a miles-long 30-bomber formation comprised of ten cells of three B-52s each, Harten arrived nine minutes early for his scheduled rendezvous with a KC-135 tanker jet southwest of the Philippines’ Luzon Peninsula.He was told by his navigator to roll into a 360-degree turn to burn off the extra nine minutes.As he initiated the maneuver, he radioed to the navigator, located on the deck below him in the behemoth plane.“Radar,” Harten said, “You do realize that if there’s another cell four minutes behind and on the south track, there’s a good chance we’ll pass by them head on?”“Rog,” said the navigator, “so keep your eyes open.”“Keep your eyes open?” Harten thought to himself, startled. “This is the worst maneuver ever.”But his rank and the chain-of-command dictated that he follow orders.Which he did.Four minutes later, he spotted the oncoming lights of another three-plane B-52 cell approaching head-on. With a closing speed of over 1,000 mph, there was almost no time to react.The oncoming B-52 dove just beneath Harten’s jet, nearly avoiding a collision. But its 4-story-high vertical stabilizer, or tail, protruded enough to slice off the outer third of Harten’s right wing, sparking the detonation of a fuel tank, which in turn blew off the entire wing.The oncoming B-52, shorn of its vertical stabilizer, went into a flat spin before failing catastrophically and blooming into a massive fireball that could be seen by trailing B-52s from more than 200 miles away in the night sky. Only one of six crew members from that plane would survive.Harten would eject perhaps three seconds before his jet exploded a few hundred yards beneath him, its fiery remains plunging into the South China Sea. Two other crew members from that plane, along with Harten, would survive.It was the first story I ever told in public, at the age of five in the fall of 1965, to a rapt audience of fellow kindergartners during show-and-tell, me with a plastic model of a B-52 and an accompanying front-page account of the incident for props. I was amazed by the tale then, and have grown ever more amazed as the years pass, enough so that it is the central drama of my latest book, Midair (Lyons Press, 2016.)No other such story has the historical gravitas. Harten was on the B-52’s very first combat mission, one that would plunge America deeply and irrevocably into the Vietnam War.Few stories have the death-defying, million-to-one odds of survival. Harten is likely the only living pilot to have survived a high-altitude, catastrophic jet collision, and one of the very few in the history of aviation to have successfully ejected at an extreme altitude and high velocity.Few tales contain as much true-life, adrenaline-soaked terror. Harten’s problems were just starting when he left his B-52 cockpit. The collision occurred above Super Typhoon Dinah, a Category 5 monster, the fourth-largest typhoon on record in the 20th century, with top winds of 185 mph and waves of 30 to 70 feet. He and his three surviving comrades are surely the only people to have ever survived a parachute drop into a Category 5 storm.Few stories involve such a steady avalanche of trauma, most any single of which would rank among the top 10 of nearly every individual’s worst phobias: a fiery plane crash, free fall, typhoon, mountainous waves, lost at sea, and open ocean. Oh, yes, and to top it off, there was the small detail of sitting solo in a life raft about the size of a very small bathtub, retching from sea sickness and bleeding from a shrapnel-cut leg – essentially, chumming for sharks, which, on cue, showed up en masse, as the seas calmed and the storm moved north, their huge fins slicing circles through the water around the laughably small inflatable, drawn by the powerful lure of vomit and blood. That Harten’s amphibious rescue plane, an HU-16 Albatross, crashed back into the ocean just after scooping up the four survivors – as ridiculously implausible as that even sounds – was perhaps almost inevitable given the previous chain of events.So how does one survive such an onslaught of bad luck?“You just take what the good lord gives you and work with it,” says Harten, now 78, from his home in Las Vegas. “And sometimes he doesn’t give you much.”No, sometimes he doesn’t. Certainly not on June 18, 1965.“Panic, though, is the real killer. And I never panicked. Not once. I just remembered my training, played it as smart as I could and took everything one at a time as it came.”Easier said than done, of course.“There were at least a dozen different ways I could’ve died through the ordeal. It seemed as though every single thing was conspiring to kill me. There was the collision itself. My ejection button failed on the first three tries. I was swinging so hard from my parachute on the way down, it almost became tangled into a useless ball. When I landed in the ocean, I was dragged by the winds across the water in my chute at probably more than 100 mph. I’m fairly certain I set the world speed record for water skiing. That almost killed me, for sure. The waves, as big as five-story buildings, were relentless and horrific. I had no food or water – that compartment of my survival gear got torn off in the ejection. And the way I was losing fluids due to sea sickness, I figured I had only another 24 hours in me, if that. It was a miracle we were found so quickly. The rescue plane crash was almost beyond my ability to comprehend. But for sheer terror, there’s nothing quite like a three-foot high fin passing so close you could reach out and touch it. If that doesn’t get your attention, nothing will. And for me, I’d prefer death by just about anything other than a shark.”But what to me is most remarkable about Harten’s story is what he did after his ordeal. He immediately got back into a plane and flew. And flew and flew and flew.He is the only living pilot who was in the Vietnam theater of war from the very first bomb dropped in February 1965 to the very last in December 1972. He flew a remarkable 319 combat missions over five tours of duty in Vietnam and is the only pilot to have ever flown the B-52, F-105 and F-111 in combat.“Why?” I asked him.“I loved flying combat,” he said. “I loved it more than life itself. There’s nothing – and I mean nothing – in any of man’s pursuits that compares. To be in the cockpit of a supersonic war machine. To have to outthink and outsmart a ruthless enemy who wants you killed. To watch the world rushing by beneath you. To pull several g’s and make an aerial maneuver that maybe only one or two other people in the world could accomplish. To live every day on the edge of death so you have such a huge appreciation for life. There’s nothing really like it. Nothing at all. If I could go relive it all over again, I would in a heartbeat – even if it meant I had to go through another B-52 crash. I’d do it gladly just for a chance to fly combat again.”Here he pauses wistfully, before furrowing his brow and adding: “But I still hate sharks.”"

Chesley Sullenberger, who flew into a flock of geese in 2009 and through quick thinking, years of experience and nerves of steel, managed to safely ditch his dead-engine Airbus A320 into the Hudson River, saving all aboard.And there is Juliane Koepcke, who in 1971, at age 17, fell 10,000 feet to earth after her plane was struck by lightening and then ripped asunder by a particularly violent storm over Peru. Strapped to a row of chairs, she “helicoptered” into the Amazonian rainforest, the jungle canopy breaking her fall, after which she walked for ten days before encountering some lumbermen who canoed her back to civilization.But for my money, the most remarkable of all may be that of my uncle Don Harten, who as a young lieutenant co-pilot on June 18, 1965, managed to survive a head-on collision at 30,000 feet between two bomb- and fuel-laden B-52s, each about the size of a 747 and each traveling about 500 mph, during a nighttime aerial refueling maneuver above the South China Sea.Harten was on the venerable B-52’s inaugural bombing mission, a 5,000-mile round trip from Andersen Air Base, Guam, to what was described as a Vietcong jungle stronghold 28 miles northwest of Saigon (though it would later turn out to be an abandoned Michelin rubber plantation devoid of any enemy activity whatsoever – a portent of things to come in the Vietnam War if there ever were one.) Traveling in a miles-long 30-bomber formation comprised of ten cells of three B-52s each, Harten arrived nine minutes early for his scheduled rendezvous with a KC-135 tanker jet southwest of the Philippines’ Luzon Peninsula.He was told by his navigator to roll into a 360-degree turn to burn off the extra nine minutes.As he initiated the maneuver, he radioed to the navigator, located on the deck below him in the behemoth plane.“Radar,” Harten said, “You do realize that if there’s another cell four minutes behind and on the south track, there’s a good chance we’ll pass by them head on?”“Rog,” said the navigator, “so keep your eyes open.”“Keep your eyes open?” Harten thought to himself, startled. “This is the worst maneuver ever.”But his rank and the chain-of-command dictated that he follow orders.Which he did.Four minutes later, he spotted the oncoming lights of another three-plane B-52 cell approaching head-on. With a closing speed of over 1,000 mph, there was almost no time to react.The oncoming B-52 dove just beneath Harten’s jet, nearly avoiding a collision. But its 4-story-high vertical stabilizer, or tail, protruded enough to slice off the outer third of Harten’s right wing, sparking the detonation of a fuel tank, which in turn blew off the entire wing.The oncoming B-52, shorn of its vertical stabilizer, went into a flat spin before failing catastrophically and blooming into a massive fireball that could be seen by trailing B-52s from more than 200 miles away in the night sky. Only one of six crew members from that plane would survive.Harten would eject perhaps three seconds before his jet exploded a few hundred yards beneath him, its fiery remains plunging into the South China Sea. Two other crew members from that plane, along with Harten, would survive.It was the first story I ever told in public, at the age of five in the fall of 1965, to a rapt audience of fellow kindergartners during show-and-tell, me with a plastic model of a B-52 and an accompanying front-page account of the incident for props. I was amazed by the tale then, and have grown ever more amazed as the years pass, enough so that it is the central drama of my latest book, Midair (Lyons Press, 2016.)No other such story has the historical gravitas. Harten was on the B-52’s very first combat mission, one that would plunge America deeply and irrevocably into the Vietnam War.Few stories have the death-defying, million-to-one odds of survival. Harten is likely the only living pilot to have survived a high-altitude, catastrophic jet collision, and one of the very few in the history of aviation to have successfully ejected at an extreme altitude and high velocity.Few tales contain as much true-life, adrenaline-soaked terror. Harten’s problems were just starting when he left his B-52 cockpit. The collision occurred above Super Typhoon Dinah, a Category 5 monster, the fourth-largest typhoon on record in the 20th century, with top winds of 185 mph and waves of 30 to 70 feet. He and his three surviving comrades are surely the only people to have ever survived a parachute drop into a Category 5 storm.Few stories involve such a steady avalanche of trauma, most any single of which would rank among the top 10 of nearly every individual’s worst phobias: a fiery plane crash, free fall, typhoon, mountainous waves, lost at sea, and open ocean. Oh, yes, and to top it off, there was the small detail of sitting solo in a life raft about the size of a very small bathtub, retching from sea sickness and bleeding from a shrapnel-cut leg – essentially, chumming for sharks, which, on cue, showed up en masse, as the seas calmed and the storm moved north, their huge fins slicing circles through the water around the laughably small inflatable, drawn by the powerful lure of vomit and blood. That Harten’s amphibious rescue plane, an HU-16 Albatross, crashed back into the ocean just after scooping up the four survivors – as ridiculously implausible as that even sounds – was perhaps almost inevitable given the previous chain of events.So how does one survive such an onslaught of bad luck?“You just take what the good lord gives you and work with it,” says Harten, now 78, from his home in Las Vegas. “And sometimes he doesn’t give you much.”No, sometimes he doesn’t. Certainly not on June 18, 1965.“Panic, though, is the real killer. And I never panicked. Not once. I just remembered my training, played it as smart as I could and took everything one at a time as it came.”Easier said than done, of course.“There were at least a dozen different ways I could’ve died through the ordeal. It seemed as though every single thing was conspiring to kill me. There was the collision itself. My ejection button failed on the first three tries. I was swinging so hard from my parachute on the way down, it almost became tangled into a useless ball. When I landed in the ocean, I was dragged by the winds across the water in my chute at probably more than 100 mph. I’m fairly certain I set the world speed record for water skiing. That almost killed me, for sure. The waves, as big as five-story buildings, were relentless and horrific. I had no food or water – that compartment of my survival gear got torn off in the ejection. And the way I was losing fluids due to sea sickness, I figured I had only another 24 hours in me, if that. It was a miracle we were found so quickly. The rescue plane crash was almost beyond my ability to comprehend. But for sheer terror, there’s nothing quite like a three-foot high fin passing so close you could reach out and touch it.

36,SPORTS,Black Americans Support Colin Kaepernick. White People? Not So Much,Maxwell Strachan,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colin-kaepernick-black-white-divide_us_57cf10cbe4b03d2d4596a9b6,Even white Democrats are more likely to disapprove of his protest.,2016-09-06,There is a strong racial divide over Colin Kaepernick's protest.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57cf14611700002430c77f0c.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Colin Kaepernick might have the hottest-selling jersey in the NFL, but he sure doesn’t have the support of white America. Only 29 percent of white Americans approve of the San Francisco 49ers quarterback’s recent decision to sit during the national anthem in protest of the mistreatment of people of color in the U.S., while 69 percent disapprove, according to a new YouGov poll.Among black Americans, the sentiment is essentially flipped. Seventy-two percent of black American approve of Kaepernick’s protest, while only 19 percent disapprove.Something of a similar divide exists between Democrats and Republicans, with Democrats much more likely than Republicans to support Kaepernick. However, if you focus solely on white Democrats, that support shrinks noticeably. By and large, white Democrats are more likely to disapprove of Kaepernick’s actions.The black-white divide over Kaepernick, while stark, closely mirrors other polls on related issues. Last year, a poll conducted by the Associated Press and NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found three-fourths of black Americans saw the police’s use of force as a serious problem, compared to just one-fifth of white Americans. Similarly, the poll also found that the vast majority of black Americans believed police were more likely to use force against a black person, while the vast majority of whites did not believe that to be the case. Kaepernick has made clear that he was sitting during the national anthem to draw attention to such mistreatment ― a specific problem he believes must be fixed. “To me, this is bigger than football, and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way,” he said late last month. “There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder.”His decision has drawn both praise and ire, with some saying it could cost him his NFL career. On Monday, however, President Barack Obama vocalized his support of the quarterback. “He’s exercising his constitutional right to make a statement,” Obama said. “I think there is a long history of sports figures doing so.”"
37,POLITICS,Conservative Activist Phyllis Schlafly Dead At 92,Chloe Angyal and Nick Visser,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conservative-activist-phyllis-schlafly-dead-at-92_us_57ce0171e4b0a22de096adfe,Schlafly was instrumental in the defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment.,2016-09-05,Schlafly wipes her face after a protester who objected to her work in opposition to the ERA threw apple pie at her in April 1977.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Long-time conservative activist Phyllis Schlafly has died at the age of 92, according to The Eagle Forum, a pro-family conservative organization that she co-founded in 1972.Eunie Smith, who served as the organization’s first vice president, said in a statement, that “America has lost a great stateswoman, and we at Eagle Forum and among the conservative movement have lost a beloved friend and mentor, who taught and inspired so many to fight the good fight in defense of American values.”Schlafly was born in 1924 and raised in St. Louis, and attended Washington University in St. Louis before getting a Master’s degree in government from Radcliffe and a J.D. from Washington University Law School. In 1949, she married John Schlafly, Jr., an attorney from a wealthy St. Louis family.She launched two unsuccessful bids for Congress shortly after getting married. But she first became a conservative celebrity in 1964 with her book “A Choice Not an Echo,” which sold three million copies and helped propel Barry Goldwater to the Republican nomination.Schlafly was a vocal opponent of the women’s liberation movement that took hold in the United States in the 1970s, and was a key player in the defeat of the dearly-held feminist dream of an Equal Rights Amendment (ERA). The Eagle Forum was originally known as STOP ERA, though the effort to defeat the amendment would become synonymous with Schlafly’s name.Schlafly argued that an ERA would harm American housewives, warning that it would make it more difficult for mothers to obtain custody in divorce cases and that it would do away with alimony and child support requirements. She also argued that it would lead to same-sex marriage and government funding for abortions, both of which she fiercely opposed, despite having a gay son.Most powerfully, she argued that an Equal Rights Amendment would lead to the conscription of women into the armed forces. It was largely due to Schlafly’s lobbying that the amendment fell three states short of ratification, and died. Schlafly threw a party to celebrate its demise. Despite her opposition to women’s liberation and her activism to preserve traditional gender roles, Schlafly was hardly the embodiment of the suburban housewife ideal she reified. She worked outside the home for most of her adult life; during World War 2, she worked the night shift in an ordnance plant, and then went on to have a long public life as a grassroots activist. In addition to her 1952 Congressional run, she ran unsuccessfully for the presidency of the National Federation of Republican Women. She hosted a weekly talk show and regularly contributed media commentary to several television networks. Yet, she once told a reporter that when filling out applications, she always listed her occupation as “mother.”She faced a range of opposition from the likes of feminist Betty Friedan (who said she’d like to burn Schlafly at the stake) to a demonstrator that threw a pie in her face (apple, “in the tradition of motherhood.”)Schlafly, a delegate for the most recent Republican National Convention, had participated in every party convention since 1952. In an interview with Think Progress, she defended the GOP’s notoriously anti-women platform, lambasted the military’s opening of combat roles to women and railed against efforts for equal pay and paid parental leave.“[That’s] not what we want at all,” she told the outlet. “Women don’t need anything special ... We’ve got very generous family leave right now. I do think the support of the children is the responsibility of the husband, not the employer.”Schlafly, a vocal Trump supporter throughout the primaries, also said she didn’t believe a female president would be better for America than a man.“Our greatest presidents have all been men,” she said, “and they’ve been very good for our country.”In a statement, the Trump campaign praised Schlafly for “fearlessly battl[ing] globalism and the ‘kingmakers’ on behalf of America’s workers and families, and called her “a patriot, a champion for women, and a symbol of strength. She fought every day right to the end for America First.”Schlafly was the author of 27 books and thousands of articles, according to the Eagle Forum. Her latest, titled “The Conservative Case for Trump” and co-written with Ed Martin and Brett Decker, is due to be released on Tuesday.She will be best remembered, however, as the leader of the fight against the Equal Rights Amendment, which she said she waged on the grounds that women needed no additional protection beyond that provided by existing laws. “I simply didn’t believe we needed a constitutional amendment to protect women’s rights,” she told The New York Times in 2006. “I knew of only one law that was discriminatory toward women, a law in North Dakota stipulating that a wife had to have her husband’s permission to make wine.” The following year, during a talk at Bates College, she told graduates that, “by getting married, the woman has consented to sex, and I don’t think you can call it rape.”CORRECTION: A previous version of this article mischaracterized Schlafly’s speech at Bates College as a commencement address. She gave the speech at the invitation of a campus Republican group."
