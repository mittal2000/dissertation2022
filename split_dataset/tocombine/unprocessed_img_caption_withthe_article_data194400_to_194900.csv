(FYI: That means ""Ireland Forever."") As Saturday is St. Patrick's Day, you're definitely in need of a watering hole to throw back a Guinness (or two, or three) -- or at least an Irish pub to fill up on some Black & White pudding. We're pretty excited about all the beef stew and Bailey's we plan on imbibing this weekend. If you still need a place to party, try out one of these Irish pubs in a city near you. We promise a good time -- and at least a few pints.--Rachel Jacoby"
