The ""customer is changing and we're ready to change with her and him,"" said the 69-year-old Jeffries, who very rarely grants interviews. The CEO, who infamously maligned plus-sized people a few years ago, also said the brand is doing away with some of the outsize logos on its clothing and enlisting popular Instagrammers and fashion bloggers in its marketing efforts. Jeffries said he would hand over some power to two soon-to-be named presidents of the Hollister and Abercrombie Kids brands. So far, a number of Hollister “test stores” have deployed black clothes, brighter colors, quieter music, and less cologne spritzed throughout the space, while certain Abercrombie stores are experimenting with window displays and doing away with the window blinds meant to convey VIP club-like exclusivity. Abercrombie's sales have fallen off a cliff over the past year and the formerly cool retailer -- known for its razor focus on male models with exceptional abdominals -- is struggling to stay relevant. In February, after announcing a 58 percent drop in profits, the company slashed clothing prices in an effort to compete with popular, inexpensive fast-fashion retailers like Forever 21 and H&M. Jeffries himself has been a lightning rod for controversy. Last year, he came under fire after comments resurfaced from 2006 when he told Salon he only wanted to market to ""cool, good-looking people."" Jeffries said at the time: ""Are we exclusionary? Absolutely."" In January Jeffries was stripped of his company chairmanship. ""[Abercrombie] was once the aspirational teen retailer, and that's gone,"" retail analyst Eric Beder told The Huffington Post following the company’s February announcement. Wondering what Jeffries beef with black is? Here's a statement the company provided to Business Insider:""We are a casual lifestyle brand and feel black clothing is formal,” the company said last year. “We have nothing against black clothing and feel it is perfectly appropriate for things like tuxedos."""

3,COLLEGE,Emerson's Advice to Millennials: With Perseverance Comes New Powers,"Ryan Holiday, ContributorMedia strategist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/post_7672_b_5362399.html,"Our generation needs to always remember that over a hundred years before us, people stood right where we were and felt very similar things, struggling with the same issues. People have always had to dig themselves out of messes they had nothing to do with creating.",2014-05-21,"Portrait of American poet, writer and philosopher Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803 - 1882), 1870s. Regarded as the foremost figure of the American Transcendentalist Movement, Emerson began during the 1830s to lecture and promote his views, emphasizing man's unique spiritual place in nature. Condemned by the church for his liberal philosophy, he helped signal the independence of American thought from European influence in his famous 1837 Harvard lecture.(Photo by Hulton Archive/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae4eab240000510096604d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The media narrative about millennials is well worn right now. You'll read they're lazy, narcissistic, soft, and entitled. It's a great way to get pageviews -- it either gratifies the older reader, or it pisses of the younger one. The result is a lot of comments and angry Facebook shares.Of course, this doesn't accomplish anything. The reality is that the economic situation for millennials is not a good one. Thirty-six percent of our generation still lives with their parents. Unemployment for millennials is twice the national average. Half of all Millennials have taken a job they didn't want just to pay the bills and only 30 percent consider their current job a career. According to one 2011 study by the University of Michigan, many graduates aren't even bothering to learn how to drive. The road is blocked, they are saying, so why get a license I won't be able to use? Despite student loan debt rising above $1 trillion, surpassing credit card debt, we go back to school.And a lot of young people are stuck because of it. We are paralyzed by the obstacles which lay before us. Fear. Frustration. Confusion. Helplessness. Anger. Depression. These are understandable emotions in the face of what seems like insurmountable obstacles everywhere we look.Of course, this has always been the case for young people. As Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote in 1841:""If our young men miscarry in their first enterprises, they lose all heart. If the young merchant fails, men say he is ruined. If the finest genius studies at one of our colleges, and is not installed in an office within one year afterwards in the cities or suburbs of Boston or New York, it seems to his friends and to himself that he is right in being disheartened, and in complaining the rest of his life.""If that was printed in The New Yorker tomorrow under a different name, no one would bat an eye. That's because our situation is not unique. We're all, at varying points in our lives, subject to random and often incomprehensible events. It just so happens that when we are young we don't have the framework to deal with these problems. We have no idea how to turn them around.But we are in great luck, because we can find examples in the icons of history who used this formula to persevere and turn their obstacles into advantage. They took what should have held them back -- paralyzed with the same emotions we are feeling -- and used it to achieve great success. Just like them we have the ability to see our obstacles for what they are and attack them to achieve what we want in life. Like them, we can use the following framework to stand out amongst those who remain mired in this rut.Control Your Perceptions John D. Rockefeller took his first job in 1855 at the age of 16 making 50 cents a day. Less than two years later the Panic of 1857 struck. It was at the time the greatest market depression in US history and it had hit him just as he was starting his career. Instead of getting angry or growing despondent, he looked at the panic as an opportunity to learn, a baptism in the market. Within 20 years of that first crisis, Rockefeller would alone control 90 percent of the oil market. We can try to see disaster rationally. Or rather, like Rockefeller, we can see opportunity in every disaster, and transform that negative situation into an education, a skill set, or a fortune.Laura Ingalls Wilder, author of the classic series Little House, faced some of the toughest and unwelcoming elements on the planet: harsh and unyielding soil, Indian territory, and the humid backwoods of Florida. But Wilder wasn't afraid or jaded, she saw all these unforgiving environments as adventures. As she put it: ""There is good in everything, if only we look for it.""For us, we face things that are not nearly as intimidating, and then promptly decide we're screwed. Just because other people say that something is hopeless or crazy or broken to pieces doesn't mean it is. We decide what story to tell ourselves. Or whether we will tell one at all. That is the power of perception.Direct Your Actions When former President James Garfield couldn't afford his tuition at the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute in 1851, he paid his way through by persuading the school to let him be the janitor in exchange for tuition. Within just one year of starting at the school he was a professor -- teaching a full course load in addition to his studies. By his 26th birthday he was the dean.In the 1920s Amelia Earhart couldn't make a living as a female pilot, so she took a job as a social worker. Then one day the phone rang. On the other end of the line was a pretty offensive offer: She could be the first woman to fly across the Atlantic, but she wouldn't actually fly the plane and she wouldn't get paid anything. Guess what she said to the offer? She said yes. Less than five years later she was the first woman to fly solo nonstop across the Atlantic and became, rightly, one of the most famous and respected people in the world.Sometimes, on the road to where we are going or where we want to be, we have to do things that we'd rather not do. Often when we are just starting out, our first jobs ""introduce us to the broom,"" as Andrew Carnegie famously put it. There's nothing shameful about sweeping. It's just another opportunity to excel -- and to learn.Strengthen Your Will Theodore Roosevelt spent almost everyday during the first 12 years of his life struggling with horrible asthma. The attacks were an almost nightly near-death experience. But as a fragile child born into great wealth and status, he could have remained weak and would have been taken care of throughout his life.Instead, he one day looked at his father and said with determination: ""I'll make my body."" He proceeded to work out feverishly every day for the next five years. By his early twenties his battle against asthma was essentially over. Roosevelt had worked it out of his body. Like Roosevelt, we can choose to not accept the hand we're dealt with, a hand we don't control. Instead of sitting back and enjoying the modern cushy life, we can prepare for the adversity that is all but guaranteed to come our way and react accordingly.Abraham Lincoln's life was defined by enduring and transcending great difficulty. He grew up in poverty, lost his mother while he was still a child, and suffered through intense bouts of depression. Because of the difficulties he endured in both his personal life and as President, he was able to embody the Stoic maxim: sustine et abstine. Bear and forbear. Acknowledge the pain but trod onward in your task. With all our modern technology has come the conceited delusion that we control the world around us, which is of course not true. We can follow Lincoln's example and adjust to a world that is inherently unpredictable by remaining confident, calm, and ready to work regardless of the conditions.Our generation needs to always remember that over a hundred years before us, people stood right where we were and felt very similar things, struggling with the same issues. People have always had to dig themselves out of messes they had nothing to do with creating.This is a recession, not the Great Depression. Those that came before us dealt with much worse problems and had fewer safety nets and tools at their disposal. They dealt with the same obstacles we have today, plus those that they worked so hard and sacrificed their lives to eliminate for us. We'd be so much better following the lead of Emerson's counterexample, as someone who ""tries all the professions, who teams it, farms it, peddles, keeps a school, preaches, edits a newspaper, goes to Congress, buys a township, and so forth, in successive years, and always, like a cat, falls on his feet.""This is perseverance. And with it, Emerson said, ""with the exercise of self-trust, new powers shall appear.""_____________ Ryan Holiday is the bestselling author of The Obstacle Is The Way.

4,WORLDPOST,Lebanon's Cannabis Farms Flourish As Army Looks Away,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lebanon-cannabis-farms_n_5362711.html,,2014-05-21,"TO GO WITH A STORY BY JOCELYNE ZABLIT A Lebanese farmers harvests cannabis plants at a place somewhere in the Bekaa valley, 26 September 2007. Dozens of farmers across the lush Bekaa valley, known in Roman times as the breadbasket of the world, have taken advantage of Lebanon's political vacuum this year to plant the largest cannabis crop since the end of the 1975-1990 civil war. AFP PHOTO/RAMZI HAIDAR (Photo credit should read RAMZI HAIDAR/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1369d240000d30b519fcf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Laila Bassam and Dominic EvansBEKAA VALLEY, Lebanon, May 20 (Reuters) - Driving around his Bekaa Valley farmland, Ali Nasri Shamas carries a revolver by his side and an automatic rifle in the back of his car, weapons he says he's ready to use if the army moves in to try to destroy his lucrative cannabis crop.But he may not need them this year. With Syria's civil war raging 30 miles (50 km) away, Lebanese security forces have other priorities than their annual showdown with the Bekaa hashish growers.""If they want a confrontation that's no problem for us, it will be harvest season soon,"" Shamas says, standing in a field of the green, spiky-leafed plants from which hashish resin is extracted.In recent years, security forces have sent tractors, bulldozers and armored vehicles to plow up, flatten or burn the cannabis crops, leading to clashes with farmers armed with assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades.Dramatic as they were, those shows of force by authorities achieved only partial success in a region where the state holds limited sway and even the militant Shi'ite group Hezbollah is reluctant to confront formidable local clans.Since 2012, the campaign has been quietly shelved.Two years ago farmers blocked roads when security forces started burning cannabis. The government backed down and the interior minister promised to look into compensating farmers for crop eradication and finding them alternative sources of income, pledges the farmers say have not been honored.Last year, as violence spilled over the border from Syria's civil war - with bombs and gunfights in Lebanon's coastal cities and rockets striking towns in the Bekaa - authorities called a halt to a battle they had waged with farmers since the end of Lebanon's own 1975-1990 civil war.During that war, the fertile Bekaa Valley produced up to 1,000 tonnes of cannabis resin annually, before it was briefly stamped out under a United Nations program between 1991-1993.""From the 1990s until 2012, cannabis eradication took place on an annual basis,"" said Colonel Ghassan Shamseddine, head of Lebanon's drug enforcement unit.""But in 2012...it was halted because of the situation on the Lebanese borders and the instability in Syria,"" he said in an interview in Beirut. CALLS FOR LEGALIZATIONShamas has grown a variety of crops in his 135 acres (54 hectares) of fields, including barley, wheat, onions and potatoes. But cannabis provides by far the best returns.It's also a hardy crop, well suited to withstand the unusually dry winter which Lebanon suffered this year, without the need for expensive irrigation.It costs between $100 and $150 to cultivate one dunum (a quarter of an acre, or tenth of a hectare), much less than a field of wheat. At harvest time in late summer, farmers can get up to $3,000 per dunum.""With hashish no one loses,"" says Shamas, who has planted more of it as a portion of his overall crop in recent years.The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ranked Lebanon in 2011 as one of the world's top five sources of cannabis resin. Shamseddine said official figures suggested the total area of cannabis planted has remained constant over the last three years at around 35,000 dunums, though it has fluctuated sharply in the preceding years.In 2005, a tumultuous year when Syrian forces ended their 29-year military presence in Lebanon, 64,000 dunums were planted. That fell to 11,000 by 2010, the year before Syria's uprising erupted and Lebanon slipped towards domestic turmoil.The long and inconclusive campaign against the cannabis crop, combined with recent moves to legalize the drug in two U.S. states, has led some prominent Lebanese to add their voices to the farmers' calls for cultivation to be legalized.Veteran Druze leader Walid Jumblatt - insisting he had never smoked marijuana - said last month he supported growing cannabis for medicinal use, arguing that regulated crop cultivation would improve living conditions in poorer areas of the Bekaa Valley.Economist Marwan Iskander said fully legalizing the cannabis crop would help Bekaa and another impoverished part of Lebanon, the northern Akkar region, as well as contributing $400 million to the state budget and $2 billion to the wider economy at a time when Lebanon is struggling with the fallout of Syria's war.""At this stage it would have a big impact,"" he said. ""Lebanon needs this farming and needs to revive the Bekaa and Akkar regions.""While conceding the idea was unlikely to gain widespread support, he said he had floated it to senior United Nations and World Bank officials in Beirut. ""They didn't say at the outset that this is going too far,"" he said. READY TO FIGHTIn practice, Shamseddine says that as long as the drug control efforts take second place to containing the spread of Syria's conflict into Lebanon, cannabis cultivation will be seen to be officially tolerated, at least by the farmers.""Every year that passes without eradication encourages people,"" he said.Shamas said authorities should take a step further and formally recognize cannabis as a legal crop - a move he said would have benefits for all.""We don't like cultivating cannabis by force and making problems,"" he said. ""When the state legalizes it and gives licenses, as they do for tobacco cultivation, we would abide by that, and the state would receive (revenues) from us.""Regardless what stance officials take, Shamas said he will continue sowing more and more.""Every year we've planted cannabis and every year we've increased the area which we've planted. The year they destroyed it we promised them we would plant five times that amount"".""If they want to legalize it, we'll thank them. If we knew that the state was looking after us we wouldn't lift a gun towards a soldier,"" he said ""But if anyone from the state's gangs fights us, we will fight back."" (Editing by Peter Graff)"

The actress best known for playing Shoshanna Shapiro on HBO's ""Girls"" recently wrote an essay for Glamour about the rigid definition of success placed on women as an incidental result of female empowerment. While feminists strive for the equality of the sexes, many times this equality hinges on achieving a historically male definition of success. ""We kept the old male ideas of success: power and money. We need new ones!"" Mamet writes.Female icons such as Hillary Clinton, Beyoncé and Oprah are rightly celebrated for their accomplishments, but complete domination of a field shouldn't be the only cultural barometer for success. Mamet describes how the traditional definition of success can hinder women from pursuing what actually makes them happy: As women we have internalized the idea that every morning we wake up, we have to go for the f--king gold. You can’t just jog; you have to run a triathlon. Having a cup of coffee, reading the paper, and heading to work isn’t enough -- that’s settling, that’s giving in, that’s letting them win. You have to wake up, have a cup of coffee, conquer France, bake a perfect cake, take a boxing class, and figure out how you are going to get that corner office or become district supervisor, while also looking damn sexy -- but not too sexy, because cleavage is degrading -- all before lunchtime.She argues that ""as a by-product of a good thing,"" feminism may have taught women to privilege career success over true personal fulfillment. Whether it's staying at home with your children, running for office or opening a coffee shop, Mamet writes that feeling accomplished shouldn't come with a guideline -- it should be on our own terms. And, as women, we need to support each other's personal definitions of success. ""Success isn’t about winning everything; it’s about achieving your dream, be that teaching middle school or flying jets,"" Mamet writes. ""And no matter what we as individual women want, no matter what our goals, we have to support one another."" While leaning in may work for some, Mamet's words remind us that it's not leaning in that defines feminism but your choice to do so. The HuffPost Women team will implement our new definition of success with a nap and maybe some ice cream.  "

There's no secret that this new class of millennials have some tough road blocks ahead of them. Education and career experts have been discussing the career challenges of millennials for the past seven years. If you are still looking for the perfect graduation gift, consider this book: What Next? The Millennial's Guide To Surviving and Thriving in the Real World. This book is filled with every tactic I've personally used and implemented from the ages 15-27, which has allowed me to thrive both as an employee and entrepreneur despite a down economy. I've built successful businesses and I've climb the ranks in Corporate America working for some of the biggest businesses in their industries both as a Sr. Marketing Manager and a Business Consultant. I want to help your son, daughter, niece, nephew or that special loved one in your life achieve success as well, which is why I wrote this book. What Next has been endorsed by top industry influencers, including Barbara Corcoran of ABC's Shark Tank, and has received rave reviews from professors of Northwestern University and the Wharton School of Business.Why Does This Book Matter?The world we live in today has dramatically changed and the path the next generation has been led down no longer works. If you're not desperately afraid for the outcome of the millennial in your life then you need to listen up. Allow me to present three bone-chilling realities about the world we live in today that will affect your loved one's ability to survive and thrive in the real world. It's time to release the veil of deceit and get real. In my book I discuss the following topics at great length. Here's a preview:The Prosperity Paradox:Prosperity will be the biggest problem the millennial generation faces. Despite being the most educated generation in history, they will struggle to figure out how to provide a comfortable living that also affords them the opportunity to travel, save money, buy a home and plan for retirement. It will be an uphill battle as they deal with stagnant wages, increased inflation and an ever-increasing demand on higher work productivity.  Data source: Bureau of Labor and Statistics Image source: Priceless Media GroupAre you familiar with this graph? This graph illustrates that from 1972 and onwards, the average compensation for Americans has flat-lined, yet productivity has skyrocketed. To make matters worse, inflation has also gone through the roof, so we are not only being paid the same wages year over year, but our dollar also buys less. It is extremely important for millennials to understand this so that they can begin making better financial decisions. If you look at the previous three generations a horrifying trend appears. The Silent Generation were able to support their families and live the American Dream on one man's income. The Baby Boomers required supplemental income from the woman in the household in addition to the full-time income of the man, and Generation X required two full-time incomes to raise a family. So what will the trend be for millennials? Four incomes. Two full-time salaries from both partners and two supplemental incomes from part-time jobs or side businesses. This is the world we live in today and it's only going to get worse.Education Extension:When teens and young adults graduate from high school or college there's a misguided belief that education ends. They think that their days of learning are over. This couldn't be any further from the truth, especially in this day and age. In order for millennials to survive, thrive and hold onto to their jobs and receive advancements, they will have to continually increase and improve their skills. Employers already expect this, even though they won't tell you directly. I've worked for Fortune 100 businesses and every company I've worked for has expected that I know certain things that were not anywhere in my job description. I'm a marketer, but I've also been expected to intimately understand design, copywriting, coding, etc. Can you imagine what I would have done if I hadn't picked up these skills throughout the years? I would never last at a job more than one month before being fired.Being Average No Longer Works:This will be the theme for this generation. Competition in all sectors of life is at an all-time high. If you want something in life you have to be remarkable. There are far too many talented people waiting to take your spot and they will! The game has changed and unless you adapt you will be left behind. If you're a Gen Xer or a Baby Boomer you likely remember when the personal computer was released. Many people thought it was a fad, so they ignored it. Those were the same people who 10-20 years later hit a career ceiling. Don't let this happen to your beloved millennial. Make sure they are prepared to take on the world based on the world we live in today, and not the world you lived in 20 years ago.I've just released a flurry of thought-provoking ideas that I hope you understand and take seriously. It's time to think different. Money, giftcards and gadgets can be great graduation gifts, but how about considering a gift that keeps on giving? Give your loved one the gift of chance, a chance to reach their potential and a chance to live The American Dream. Once they've got this book in their hands they can never say you didn't help prepare them for the real world, so do yourself, your loved one and society a favor and get this book and spread the word! An entire generation is counting on you.Michael Price is an entrepreneur and author of What Next? The Millennial's Guide To Surviving and Thriving in the Real World.

9,POLITICS,Why The Long-Term Jobless Probably Aren't Getting Their Benefits Back,Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/unemployment-extension_n_5366298.html,,2014-05-21,"WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 20: House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) speaks to the media on Capitol Hill, May 20, 2014 in Washington, DC. Speaker Boehner spoke to reporters after attending a closed meeting with House Republicans. (Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ca072200005700dd782c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The 2 million Americans who've missed out on long-term unemployment insurance since December probably won't be getting their benefits back.Last month, the Senate passed legislation that would give lump-sum payments to people cut off since December by reauthorizing federal programs retroactively from December through May. But even if the House moved on the Senate bill this week and allowed people to collect back-payments, the long-term jobless would only receive support for one more week before the benefits expired again.Now, the retrospective push is losing steam. Though they still say House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) should allow a vote on the Senate bill, the senators advocating for the legislation are wondering if it remains practical after all this time.""Or have we reached a point because of the delay that the prospective option is the only one that's viable,"" Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.) told HuffPost on Tuesday.In other words, Reed and Sen. Dean Heller (R-Nev.), the two senators from the states with the highest rates of unemployment, might abandon back payments in favor of restoring the safety net for people who become unemployed for long periods of time in the future.""We haven't come to any conclusions,"" Reed said.Reed and Heller may try to attach the federal benefits to unrelated transportation or tax legislation, but those are long shots. Since 2008, Democrats have successfully won reauthorizations of unemployment a dozen different times. Usually, the benefits have been combined with some other urgent, Republican-friendly piece of legislation -- a key ingredient that has been missing this time. In 2010, lawmakers attached the unemployment benefits to a two-year reauthorization of the expiring Bush-era tax cuts, and they added a one-year payroll tax break for workers. The payroll tax cut's looming expiration helped lawmakers cut another deal the following year, but Republicans also insisted on a slew of reforms to the unemployment system, including a reduction in the number of weeks of assistance. During recessions, Congress always gives extra weeks of benefits to people laid off through no fault of their own if they can't find work after using the standard 26 weeks of benefits offered by states. The deal cut early in 2012 pared the combination of state and federal benefits back from a maximum of 99 weeks to 73 weeks, and it set in motion more reductions that would happen automatically when state unemployment rates declined. At the end of 2012, the benefits once again hitched a ride with the Bush tax cuts in the ""fiscal cliff"" drama. Then, following a government shutdown last fall, Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) got to work on a bipartisan budget agreement. Democrats did not insist on attaching the unemployment benefits to the budget deal, hoping they could be handled separately before the end of the year. The budget deal might have been their best chance to save the benefits from expiring at the end of December.""If they really wanted to get this done, they would've taken that week in December when the House was gone and the Senate was in and jammed us"" by attaching the benefits and sending the bill back to the House, a House GOP leadership aide said, speaking anonymously in order to discuss the matter candidly. ""We were certainly expecting them to do it, and that was their best chance.""  Instead, the Senate passed the budget deal clean, later addressing the benefits as standalone legislation. Democrats have been beating up Boehner for refusing to allow a vote on the Senate bill, hoping the pressure would change his mind. ""The House could pass the legislation very quickly,"" Reed said Tuesday. ""It is a bipartisan, fully paid-for Senate bill. It's more than ironic they were able to pass a multibillion-dollar tax bill unpaid for, but they can't deal with unemployment insurance for over 2 million Americans.""The strategy hasn't worked. One reason for Boehner's impassiveness is that the national unemployment rate keeps going down. When the Labor Department announced the rate had sunk to 7 percent in November, Boehner seized on the news. “Today’s report includes positive signs that should discourage calls for more emergency government 'stimulus,'"" Boehner said. Since then, the rate has declined to 6.3 percent. Yet the rate of long-term unemployment remains historically high. In April, 35.3 percent of the unemployed had been out of work six months or longer -- down from a peak of 45.3 percent in April of 2010, but still way higher than in any previous recession since World War II. The current percentage is also higher than at any other time that Congress has allowed long-term benefits to expire. After so many battles over reauthorizing unemployment benefits, it's possible some lawmakers are just getting tired of it. ""Though there are many members on both sides of the aisle who would vote yes on an unemployment insurance bill that made it to the floor, the reality is that there is tremendous fatigue on this issue, especially on the right,"" Judy Conti, a lobbyist for the National Employment Law Project who routinely deals with lawmakers, said in an email. ""Between the initial authorization of [long-term benefits] and all the expansions and reauthorizations, this is the 13th time Congress has been called on to deal with the benefits, including five different reauthorizations in 2010 alone,"" Conti said. ""In fact, it's probably the case that members of Congress have dealt with unemployment insurance more than almost any other issue since even before the recession began."" "
10,ENTERTAINMENT,Why We Need More Woman-Girls And Fewer Man-Boys In Film,Lauren Duca,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/woman-girls-man-boys_n_5366761.html,,2014-05-21,"WEST HOLLYWOOD, CA - MARCH 02: Actress Anna Kendrick arrives at the 2014 Vanity Fair Oscar Party Hosted By Graydon Carter on March 2, 2014 in West Hollywood, California. (Photo by C Flanigan/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb45c672400005100560e7d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Anna Kendrick stars in a movie called ""Happy Christmas"" this summer. Maybe you've seen the trailer? It's a film directed by Joe Swanberg, in which she drinks, and is on the floor a lot of times, and does other irresponsible things around the holidays. Happy Christmas, indeed! This sort of lady role -- in all of its flawed, regressive glory -- is the exact kind of thing we need more of. The reality of gender inequality in the film industry is inarguable. There need to be more ladies writing, directing, producing and just playing a bigger part in telling their own stories. There are stats if you need them for proof or whatever, but the reality is that we're still at a point where passing the Bechdel Test deserves acknowledgement. The issue, though, extends beyond the simple dearth of women on the big screen. A large part of disparity lies in the kinds of women we're seeing. The few times films deliver a clear protagonist female, she is defined almost entirely in relation to a man and/or kicking ass in a largely impractical Spandex outfit. There are exceptions, sure. But for the most part, we see beautiful shells of people (who won't be fulfilled until they achieve romantic aspirations) or lady superheroes (who are somehow able to shoot machine guns out of their bras). Even in the case of the genuinely empowered female character, there is often an issue of the role being confined to the single trait of being empowered. While seeing women play strong, leading ladies is great, what's more important is they are fully formed, complex individuals. This one-dimensional female is especially prevalent in comedies. As Kyle Buchanan noted over at Vulture, fewer than 10 female buddy comedies have been produced since the 1980s. And when women are in the film, they are generally present in order to be the butt of the joke. Consider Rose Byrne in ""Neighbors,"" who is practically a revolutionary addition to the cast, because, as The Wrap put it, ""director Nicholas Stoller lets [her] character deliver nearly as many punches and punchlines as the guys."" Enter the female version of a man-boy (woman-girl?). The fact that this archetype embodies a space previously almost filled entirely by men makes Anna Kendrick's role in ""Happy Christmas"" all the more important. To be clear, ""man-boys"" here refers to the kind of individual you see portrayed by Seth Rogen or Paul Rudd in films written and directed by Judd Apatow or what Time magazine referred to as ""these twentysomething Peter Pans."" This character has been so prevalent in current cinema, that it even led The Atlantic to ask whether ""the modern, postindustrial economy is simply more congenial to women than to men."" Of course, it's not. And while the man-boy has been overplayed by men, the role leaves room for depth -- a depth that can be emphasized with greater dexterity in the hands of a woman. Young men caught between childhood in adulthood are often guarded and eschew any kind of emotional expression (a prevalent trend in both bro-comedies  and real life). That limits the role to the silliness of irresponsibility, which is great for comedy, but also robs them of the depth and drama that the woman-girl version allows. There is precedent: Lizzy Caplan in ""Save The Date,"" Charlize Theron in ""Young Adult,"" basically everyone in ""Bridesmaids."" Each of these roles (and especially Theron's) specifically allows for an empathetic focus on the cause for the behavior, rather than purely dwelling in the over-the-top antic effect. Another excellent example is Olivia Wilde in ""Drinking Buddies"" (also directed by Swanberg!), in which her character's immaturity gives way to plenty of goofy irresponsible behavior, but is also colored by an overhanging sense of melancholy due to her lack of direction. So, we have potential here! Both for an A-plus Anna Kendrick role and lady complexity in general. While we'll have to wait for the July 26 release of ""Happy Christmas"" to see if it lives up to said potential, the mere fact of the premise behind the film is still good news for women, girls and woman-girls alike.

Mike Honda (D-Calif.), filed a charge with the Office of Congressional Ethics on Tuesday regarding mass mailings from Honda's office.Khanna's campaign is accusing Honda's congressional office of sending two taxpayer-funded mailers to constituents that ""mirror"" campaign mailers and use ""campaign and political slogans.""The first mailer from Honda's congressional office is designed similarly to a campaign flier and is headlined ""Delivering For Us."" The mailer lists ways in which Honda's office has served his Silicon Valley-based district, and the Khanna campaign believes it was received by Honda's constituents in March.The second mailer is on letterhead from Honda's office and tells constituents that Honda's reaching out to them about his ""work on behalf of our nation's seniors."" ""My support for critical programs like Medicare and Social Security has been unwavering, and I have always taken the lead to protect, improve, and expand our nation's safety net,"" the mailer states in the first paragraph.Khanna's campaign believes that letter, which was sent in April, was received by over 500 constituents in Honda's district.Khanna's campaign takes issue with more than just the content of the two mailers in question. They claim the mailers violated a 90-day cutoff that restricts mass mailings to over 500 constituents from candidates on an election ballot. The primary between Khanna and Honda is set to take place June 3.This charge is only likely to intensify an already heated primary in the heart of America's tech industry. Khanna, who's found allies in Silicon Valley's business community, has received high-profile endorsements from tech titans like Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg and Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer. Honda, on the other hand, has garnered most of his support from members of the California Democratic establishment, like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein. It should be noted that just because a charge is filed with the Office of Congressional Ethics, it doesn't mean the office will automatically investigate the matter. It could very well decide to not do so if it doesn't find merit in the accusation.Vivek Kembaiyan, communications director for the Honda campaign, told the Huffington Post that all taxpayer-funded congressional mailers, sometimes referred to as ""franked mail,"" is ""approved by the bipartisan Commission on Congressional Mailing Standards, including this piece by the Office of Congressman Honda. This complaint by the Ro Khanna campaign about standard mailings is a desperate and unoriginal political ploy to distract from their inability to gain traction with voters two weeks before the primary, despite spending millions of dollars.""UPDATE -- 5:49 p.m.: Khanna's campaign manager Leah Cowan sent the following statement to HuffPost:With Congressman Honda's massive amount of donations from PAC's and lobbyists, it shouldn't be necessary for hardworking families to foot the bill for such blatantly political mailers. This misuse of taxpayer dollars to subsidize his campaign is an abuse of the public trust and he should reimburse the taxpayers immediately.CORRECTION: This article has been updated to reflect California had open primary elections, not a Democratic primary election."
