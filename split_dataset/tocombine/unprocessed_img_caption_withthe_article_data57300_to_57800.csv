0,POLITICS,Welcome To The Surreal Dreamscape Of Trump's Policy Positions,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-taxes-minimum-wage_us_5731f486e4b0bc9cb0480361,Trump's nonsensical position-switching is going to be media catnip.,2016-05-10,"Eric Cheng ran Google's ""Deep Dream A.I."" against Donald Trump's July announcement that he was running for president, and created this nightmare.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573222832200008f032562a9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Believe it or not, the period in which presumptive GOP presidential nominee and doll-handed luftballon Donald Trump merely made fun of women for their menstrual cycles or retweeted ""white genocide” memes to win the affection of his fanbase was the sensible part of his campaign. The good news about this period is that you knew he meant what he was saying. Or was that the bad news? Either way, we've now given way to the part of this campaign where Trump ""clarifies"" his policy preferences. It's already a phantasmagorical universe.Over the past few days, Trump has faced inquiries about his tax plan, and his policy on the minimum wage. He has been -- how do you say? -- inconsistent. Which is perhaps understating the matter. On taxes, Trump actually released a tax plan that was going to massively benefit the wealthy -- cutting their top rate from 39.6 percent to 25 percent and giving them a few choice breaks on top of that. But when asked about it, he went on to aver that the rich would actually be taxed more.Trump's unique answer to the current flip-flop charge is to say that what goes up and what goes down is all relative to ""negotiations"" -- that his expectation is that the final numbers will differ from his current proposal. But he's a presidential candidate -- there's no one to negotiate with at the moment, except himself. And as pointed out by Andrew Kaczynski, who published this 30-year timeline of Trump’s past positions on taxes for BuzzFeed, Trump has been re-negotiating -- and re-proposing -- a tax plan for as long as anyone can remember.Barring some miraculous electoral outcome in November, a President Trump will be negotiating with a GOP-controlled Congress, so why he thinks taxes on the wealthy will ""go up"" at that point is really anyone's guess. Does he mean to veto their bill? Is he, for some reason, finding it necessary to give Republican legislators some sort of credit for being willing to do something they've never seemed inclined to do, as a sop to his angry populist base? Who knows? Next week, he will be saying something altogether different.Trump has similarly selected ""every side"" as his stance on the minimum wage. Previously, Trump was of the opinion that America's wages were definitely ""too high,"" a pronouncement that probably came as a shock to residents of a nation in which wages have been frozen in amber for decades.This past weekend, Trump took two unique positions on two different Sunday morning talk shows -- which, let's face it, is definitely the safest harbor for those who are predisposed toward not making any sense. On ""This Week,"" Trump said that he thought ""people have to get more,"" and that after he was done ""bring[ing] companies back into this country,"" they would be ""mak[ing] a lot more than the $15"" minimum proposed by minimum wage activists.But he also said, ""I'm allowed to change,"" and on ""Meet the Press,"" he did just that, saying that while he'd love for people to make more money, that it was up ""to the states"" to decide that. I thought he said he'd be bringing jobs back, though? With policies crafted from Trumpian willpower and magic? Well, who knows?Faced with the prospect of a candidate who's going to veer wildly from position to position like this, the media should just adopt the simplest stance possible: that Trump is uniquely uninterested in anything outside the central claim of his candidacy -- that his magic Green Lantern powers will simply result in winning -- and so he's content to make up the rest of it as he goes along, taking whatever stance in the moment feels like it's going to be the most popular thing to say. There's no real thought going on; Trump is literally just responding to stimulus on an instantaneous basis. He's not trying for object permanence. Instead, you can expect the press to try to sit down and grapple with this, like it's some sort of puzzle they're obligated to solve. As I've noted before, the political media has basically made it their habit and obligation to do all the thoughtful reckoning of Trump's myriad policy stances, and he's content to sit back and let them take all of his weird equations and solve for X on his behalf.This is something that the media has already taken up in earnest on taxes and the minimum wage. If you wander into the wilderness, you'll see articles that seem to think Trump has done something definitive (""How Trump clarified his position on taxing the wealthy,"" ""Trump changes tune on tax hikes for wealthy Americans”), articles that buy his line on ""negotiations"" (""Donald Trump says he's willing to tax the rich harder”), articles that suggest he's in some sort of natural political pivot (""Trump shows flexibility on taxes, minimum wage in turn toward November”), and articles that insist that Trump has actually already pulled off a con (""Sorry, suckers: Trump didn't actually shift on taxing rich and minimum wage”). What's missing is just a simple story headlined, ""Oh, wow, it turns out that Trump doesn't really have any thoughts on these issues at all, that's kind of weird, can he actually do that?""All of this comes at a time when the media itself has to pivot to the general election and they're looking at the prospect of having to somehow work Trump's fact-free sociopathy into the weave and weft of their storyline. As David Roberts elucidates at length over at Vox, their natural tendency is to abhor a ""lopsided race,"" and so it would be smart to wager on the media doing whatever work is necessary to level the playing field and create the illusion of a race that is actually competitive.And right on time, Roberts' thesis found some tidy confirmation in this Washington Post piece titled ""Clinton's wonky policies of fine-grained complexity contrast with rivals' grandiose ideas."" At first blush, you might think that this is a good thing -- but this article actually goes on to shower favor on big-sounding ideas that cannot be mapped out or explained, and it castigates Clinton for actually getting detailed about her policies.In contrast with Trump, who doesn't know from one minute to the next how he'll tax people, this article makes clear that Clinton has a specific plan to augment Wall Street regulatory reform that you can see for yourself, and a plan to allow ""undocumented residents to walk into local federal offices and ask for help,"" if Congress can't offer any guidance of their own. A specific contrast is drawn between Clinton's account-for-everything wonkiness and Trump's ""make-it-up-as-I-go"" proclivities. A guy from the libertarian Cato Institute, interviewed for some reason for this piece, notes that despite not liking either candidate, it's clear that at least ""one of them is in the real world"" while the other ""has no bearing on reality."" And yet, the general tenor of the piece is to criticize Clinton for making laws longer and seeking to give public sector employees more work to do, as if ""build a wall on the Southern border and make Mexico pay for it"" is some sort of easier, uncomplicated lift that won't trouble bureaucrats or force lengthy legislative sessions. The piece's first sentence is this: ""Hillary Clinton’s official campaign platform is now twice as long as 'Hamlet': seventy-three thousand six hundred forty-five words of policy ideas. One hundred seventy-four pages. And growing.""""Hamlet,"" by the way, is a play that teenagers study. But the larger point is this: the media often pretends to prefer policy substance to extravagant ideas, but when the moment to make a judgment arises, it turns out that they find policy substance boring and complicated. Their preferences naturally equalize to the benefit of zany nonsense. Plumbing the depths of Trump's bizarre, surrealist pastiche is, to the media, a more attractive and fun exercise than simply admitting that Clinton, while not being above critique by any stretch of the imagination, is working within logical, real-world constraints.As Milan Kundera once wrote, ""Nothing requires a greater effort of thought than arguments to justify the rule of non-thought."" And every autocrat in history has benefited from the intelligentsia's willingness to take up that task in earnest.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
1,POLITICS,"In New Anthony Weiner Documentary, It’s Hard Not To See Shades Of Trump",Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anthony-weiner-documentary-donald-trump_us_57322ddae4b096e9f092ebaa,Both candidates embrace politics as performance.,2016-05-10,"Anthony Weiner, left, has a heated argument with Shaul Kessler at Weiss Bakery in the Boro Park neighborhood in Brooklyn on Sept. 4, 2013.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- About 10 minutes into ""Weiner,"" a new documentary chronicling Anthony Weiner’s failed 2013 New York City mayoral bid, a familiar face appears within a chorus of voices chastising the former New York congressman for the sexting scandal that precipitated his downfall.""We don’t want perverts elected in New York City!"" Donald Trump, seated on a plane, says of Weiner. ""No perverts!"" Trump’s video is part of a montage of critical newspaper clippings, late-night television monologues and cable news footage that sets the scene for Weiner’s uphill climb.In the tradition of fly-on-the-wall political documentaries like ""Primary"" and ""The War Room,"" the film, which won Best Documentary at this year’s Sundance Film Festival and hits theaters later this month, traces Weiner’s attempted political comeback by intimately following his campaign. But while watching it, it’s hard not to think of the then-New York real estate mogul, now-presumptive GOP presidential nominee. As Weiner himself noted on HuffPost’s ""Candidate Confessional"" podcast in March, there are parallels between their two candidacies.In the film, Weiner’s loyal supporters -- like Trump’s -- adore him for his brash, defiant style and are undeterred by skeptics. One supporter approaches Weiner on the street and tells him not to worry about “everyone else” who is counting him out of the race. “Bullshit everyone else!” she yells.Both Weiner and Trump are ready-made candidates for the age of social media and viral sound bites because they thrive on provocation.Trump’s frequent mode of attack is Twitter. He mocks rivals, admonishes the press and lauds positive polls to his millions of followers, and the tweets often take on a life of their own. Some people perceived last week’s much-discussed taco bowl tweet as manipulation and trolling rather than a tasteless attempt to reach Hispanic voters.Weiner acknowledges in the film that “politicians are wired in some way that they need attention,” and the documentary is filled with examples of him stoking that attention. But unlike Trump, his penchant for provocation often backfires. In the process, it lays bare the complicated and symbiotic relationship between candidates and the press. In Trump’s wall-to-wall television interviews, hosts have faced criticism for not questioning his extreme and/or inconsistent policy positions and instead focusing on his antics. Weiner, by contrast, hopes for more substantive coverage of his campaign. His perpetual challenge is diverting the media narrative away from his scandal, and throughout the film, he longs for an opportunity to even mention his policy positions. In one scene, he calls a press conference to introduce a tax plan and is visibly frustrated when none of the reporters’ questions are about that topic.His major Achilles' heel is that he seems to crave confrontation and has a bad habit of engaging in it when the cameras are rolling. In a now-famous incident, a routine campaign stop at a kosher bakery just days before the primary turns ugly when Weiner gets combative with an antagonistic customer. Outside the bakery, the filmmakers interview an eyewitness to the fracas, who is dumbfounded at Weiner’s behavior.“Why didn’t he just walk away?” he says, shaking his head. “Why did he need that? It was going nicely!”Afterward, Weiner seems to regret how he escalated the situation. Yet his first reaction upon seeing the video, which has gone viral, is one of vanity: he complains about the “terrible shot” of his bald spot. Trump's and Weiner’s patterns of provocation feeds into the idea that politics can take on aspects of a performance. Though it is a documentary, the film often depicts Weiner as a character in his own tragicomedy -- a fact referenced early in the film, when he reads from an article describing him as “the protagonist of his tale.”Nowhere is that more evident than during an angry interview with MSNBC’s Lawrence O’Donnell. The documentary cuts between Weiner’s end of the interview -- him sitting alone in a New York studio, with O’Donnell’s voice in his earpiece -- and the actual footage of the interview. Without hearing O’Donnell’s end, it looks like Weiner is delivering a monologue, his voice echoing in the empty studio, bringing to mind Shakespeare’s ""Macbeth,"" who laments that he is “a poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more.” Like many moments in the film, it is simultaneously comical, and, as Trump would probably tweet, “sad!”Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
2,POLITICS,GOP Senator Wants To Know If Facebook Is Biased Against Conservatives,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-thune-facebook-conservative-news_us_573217c3e4b096e9f092d46f,The social media behemoth has been accused of suppressing conservative viewpoints.,2016-05-10,"Facebook's ""Trending"" topics have come under fire for alleged bias against conservative news outlets.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/573217f4160000e90031e51f.jpeg?cache=GkDE5xn7iT&ops=crop_30_907_3970_1760%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. John Thune (R-S.D.) penned a letter to Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday requesting information about how the company selects which news stories to feature in its trending news section, following a report alleging workers intentionally suppressed conservative news and viewpoints. On Monday, Gizmodo reported that, according to a former Facebook contractor, the site's news curators regularly prevented topics of particular interest to a conservative audience (such as the 2013 IRS scandal or the annual Conservative Political Action Conference) from appearing in the site's popular ""trending topics"" section. The report also claims that curators were instructed to insert news stories into this feed even if they weren't organically trending according to the site's algorithms. Facebook denied the report, saying there is ""no evidence"" to back up the contractor's claims. ""Facebook is a platform for people and perspectives from across the political spectrum. There are rigorous guidelines in place for the review team to ensure consistency and neutrality,"" wrote Tom Stocky, Facebook's vice president of search. ""These guidelines do not permit the suppression of political perspectives. Nor do they permit the prioritization of one viewpoint over another or one news outlet over another.""Thune, the chairman of the Senate's Commerce Committee, wasn't satisfied with Facebook's reply and sent a letter to Zuckerberg demanding further details on how the platform curates its featured news. ""Facebook must answer these serious allegations and hold those responsible to account if there has been political bias in the dissemination of trending news,"" Thune said in a statement. ""Any attempt by a neutral and inclusive social media platform to censor or manipulate political discussion is an abuse of trust and inconsistent with the values of an open Internet."" The letter contains a series of questions for Zuckerberg regarding how Facebook's trending news is curated. Thune asked who approves what content is posted, whether the site's curators had ""manipulated"" the ""trending topics"" section by excluding conservative-leaning stories and what steps the site will take to investigate the claims of bias. Thune also requested details on the guidelines the site uses for identifying its trending stories and for a list of all stories ""removed from or injected into"" the section.Read the full letter here.A Facebook spokesperson confirmed the company had received Thune's letter and is reviewing the questions posed by the senator. ""We have seen allegations that people did not honor the intent of those guidelines,"" the spokesperson said. ""Although the allegations are anonymous, we take them seriously. We are continuing to investigate whether any violations took place. As we investigate, we will also keep reviewing our operational practices around Trending Topics — and if we find they are inadequate, we will take immediate steps to fix them."" Thune's letter cited the Commerce Committee's jurisdiction over communications and consumer services as the basis for his probe. However, it's unclear how Congress could intervene with Facebook's curation practices should Thune's probe turn up any evidence of bias. Thune hasn't always been on the side of legislating ""balance"" in the media. In 2007, the senator introduced a bill that sought to kill the Federal Communications Commission's Fairness Doctrine.That policy, first established in the mid-20th century, required radio and television stations to ""afford reasonable opportunity for the discussion of conflicting views on issues of public importance."" In 1987, then-President Ronald Reagan vetoed an effort to codify the policy into law. Two decades later, Democratic lawmakers sought to revive that effort in an apparent response to the rise of talk radio stations dominated by conservative personalities such as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity. In a 2007 RealClearPolitics op-ed, Thune said the policy ""created a chilling effect among broadcasters when it came to reporting controversial topics."" ""Giving power to a few to regulate fairness in the media is a recipe for disaster on the scale that George Orwell so aptly envisioned,"" he wrote. The FCC eventually dropped the policy in 2011. Thune's office didn't immediately return a request for comment. Meanwhile, Washington Democrats seemed unconcerned by the Gizmodo report.White House press secretary Josh Earnest said it was good that Facebook clarified its practices, but talked more about people's tendencies to consume news that supports their existing beliefs.""Obviously, we were pleased to see the statement from Facebook making pretty clear this is not something that they engaged in,"" Earnest said in his daily briefing. ""The media environment, the way it's structured now, certainly makes it easy for any individual to surround themselves with voices and perspectives and opinions that they share. The president has given a number of speeches where he's talked about how important it is for citizens across the country to seek out different opinions, to challenge their own assumptions.""The White House spokesman said nothing about a need for Congress to get involved in Facebook's private business matters.Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) was asked on Tuesday whether he thought it was appropriate for the Senate to investigate Facebook.Reid, who asked to have the question repeated twice, said he was unaware of the controversy.""I've never heard anything about this and, at this stage, don't care,"" Reid said.Jennifer Bendery and Matt Fuller contributed reporting.This post has been updated with further comment from Facebook."
3,POLITICS,Opinions On Barack Obama's Economic Legacy Don't Have Much To Do With The Economy,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-economic-legacy_us_57325736e4b016f3789778f7,Views are once again divided along partisan lines.,2016-05-10,"U.S. President Barack Obama leaves after delivering a statement on the economy at the press briefing room at the White House in Washington, U.S. May 6, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57325814160000e90031e5cd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Barack Obama says his economic legacy is a lot better than he gets credit for. “I actually compare our economic performance to how, historically, countries that have wrenching financial crises perform,” he told The New York Times recently. “By that measure, we probably managed this better than any large economy on Earth in modern history.”The public, though, doesn't exactly agree. While the president's approval rating on the economy is, on average, about as high as it's been at any time since late 2009, it remains slightly underwater. Obama is the first president since 1960 who hasn't seen his approval rating rise along with gains in consumer sentiment. In a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, just one-third of Americans said that Obama made things better for the economy after the financial crisis. Another 37 percent said he made things worse, while 18 percent said he didn't have much impact, and 12 percent weren't sure. Americans' views of Obama's effect on their personal financial situation is even more bleak. Just 18 percent thought that Obama has made things better for their own financial situation since he took office, with the rest largely split between believing that he made things worse and that he didn't do much.There's a modest gap in views between the wealthiest households and everyone else. Those in households making $100,000 or more are 8 percentage points more likely than those making less than $50,000 to give Obama credit for improving the economy, and 9 points more likely to say he helped their own financial situations.Assessments of Obama's economic legacy, though, have a lot more to do with partisanship than they do with income. Two-thirds of Democrats, but just 6 percent of Republicans, think Obama made things better after the financial crisis; 39 percent of Democrats, and just 2 percent of Republicans, give him credit for helping them personally.To demonstrate just how much that partisanship plays a role in views of the economy, the HuffPost/YouGov poll split respondents into two groups. Half were asked about the performance of the economy since the year 2008. Half were asked how things had changed since Obama was elected.Republicans in the second group -- the ones responding directly to questions about Obama -- were considerably more likely to say things had gotten worse. They were 19 points more likely to say their personal financial situation had gotten worse, and 20 points more likely to say that the economy as a whole had declined, if they were asked to compare things to ""when President Obama was first elected"" rather than ""the year 2008."" Democrats and independents didn't show similarly significant differences on those questions. But polarization popped up in another way: Democrats in the group who saw Obama's name were far more reluctant to admit that income inequality has risen during his tenure than those in the group who didn't see his name.How the public views Obama's economic record matters for his legacy, but also for this year's election, which will serve partially as a referendum on eight years of Democratic policies. As recent polling shows, while concerns have faded since the crash, the economy remains the top issue on Americans' minds.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted May 3 to May 5 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov’s nationally representative opinion polling.

Congress passed a bill! President Barack Obama on Monday signed the National Bison Legacy Act into law, elevating the American bison -- our new national mammal -- to bald eagle status. The law is ""a validation of the many meaningful ways this animal represents America,"" according to a Wildlife Conservation Society press release. ""As an ecological keystone, cultural bedrock and economic driver, the bison conveys values such as unity, resilience and commitment to healthy landscapes and communities.""But the bison's path to official American icon hasn't been easy. The powerful animal has been roaming Northern America since prehistoric times, but settlers drove the population dangerously close to extinction during westward expansion.As a result of hunting and habitat destruction, Americans whittled down the population from millions to just 325 wild bison by 1884, according to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, effectively destroying an integral part of Native American culture.While many Native American tribes used every part of the bison, settlers often killed them just to harvest their valuable hides and tongues, which were considered a delicacy. The Smithsonian Institute says that from 1872 to 1874, a single railway company's records show it shipped 500,000 bison hides back to the East Coast.Today, after years of legal protection, there is once again a healthy bison population in the U.S. -- about 500,000 individuals living in both commercial and conservation herds. The species is considered America's first conservation success story.With the new law, culminating years of work by the Vote Bison Coalition, bison are finally being recognized as the quintessentially American animals they are.Really, it's a win-win situation for everyone: Americans have a new national mammal, members of Congress get to feel like they've actually done something, and bison get a consolation prize for overcoming near-extinction.

5,BUSINESS,Big Pharma Just Bet $10 Billion On A Cancer Drug Startup. Here's Why.,Ryan Grenoble,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/abbvie-stemcentrx-cancer-drug_us_57237768e4b0b49df6ab1214,"""This deal is going to end up looking either very smart or very stupid.""",2016-05-10,"A screen displays the share price for pharmaceutical maker AbbVie on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange July 18, 2014.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5723b8172200002900255032.jpeg?cache=EddljzWFvv&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Question: What do WhatsApp and a little-known (until recently) cancer research startup named Stemcentrx have in common?Answer: They're the top two largest private venture-backed acquisitions in history, after pharmaceutical giant AbbVie acquired the drug company earlier this month in a deal that values it at as high as $10 billion. (Facebook acquired WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion.)Not bad for a company that has yet to bring a product to market.What Stemcentrx (pronounced ""stem-centrix"") does have, however, is a unique -- and somewhat controversial -- approach to treating several forms of cancer. While most of today's treatments view cancer as a result of unchecked cell growth, wherein any cell is capable of becoming cancerous, Stemcentrx believes that cancer primarily sprouts from only one cell type: cancer stem cells.Cells in our bodies are constantly dying and being birthed anew. This process relies on stem cells, which are basically just cells that can grow into many other different types of cells. Over time, Stemcentrx's Chief Science Officer Dr. Scott Dylla told HuffPost, those stem cells -- like any other cell -- can accumulate genetic mutations. Given enough mutations, says Dylla, they may begin ""to act abnormally and no longer play nice with their neighbors."" In other words, they become cancerous.The stem cell theory of cancer posits that rogue stem cells are responsible for growing and perpetuating cancer, and that, unless the stem cells are themselves killed, simply shrinking or removing tumors won't stop the cancer itself.""An analogy would be a weeding technique that is evaluated based on how low it can chop the weed stalks,"" explains Stanford's Ludwig Center for Cancer Stem Cell Research and Medicine, ""but no matter how low the weeds are cut, if the roots aren’t taken out, the weeds will just grow back.""While treatments like chemotherapy and radiation can be very effective at shrinking tumors, they don't always kill the cancer completely, nor do they specifically target cancer stem cells. In some cases, the cancer returns -- and in a more aggressive form. Stemcentrx believes that's because these methods kill a broader range of cells, leaving the door open for cancer stem cells to grow back with less competition from surrounding cells than before.If Stemcentrx is correct about cancer stem cells -- and there's no clear consensus in the science community they are -- the company predicted in 2013 that their paradigm could do more for cancer treatments “in the next several decades than what has been achieved over the last century.""But not everyone is sold on the theory.“There is a major debate that is still going on [about cancer stem cell theory] and I don’t know if it’s going to be resolved so easily,” Ravi Majeti, a biologist at Stanford who studies leukemia, told MIT Technology Review last September. “It’s a complicated story, and I would say the cancer-stem-cell theory is waning a little bit.""Dylla thinks the rest of the research community will be persuaded as more of the company's anti-cancer therapies enter the pipeline and are tested in the real world.""The continued skepticism likely reflects the limited cases translating the theory into therapies that impact survival in cancer patients,"" he told HuffPost, citing ""compelling preclinical evidence"" that's already changing minds.In particular, Stemcentrx's furthest drug along in human trials, Rova-T (rovalpituzumab tesirine), has shown promise in treating small cell lung cancer, the most aggressive form of lung cancer that accounts for 15 percent of all lung cancer types. There is currently no FDA-approved treatment for small cell lung cancer.In an early-stage test last year, 44 percent of a subset of patients whose particular type of small cell lung cancer exhibited DLL3, a protein associated with cancer stem cells, responded to the drug.Rova-T also shows potential for treating metastatic melanoma, glioblastoma multiforme and some prostate, pancreatic and colorectal cancers. The company expects the drug will be available by 2018.Rova-T is one of more than 800 medicines currently in clinical testing for cancer, according to a report by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and the American Association for Cancer Research. Of those, very few will likely make it to market. In 2014, for example, the FDA approved seven treatments for melanoma, while 96 others failed. Just 10 lung cancer treatments were approved that same year, while 167 failed.For Stemcentrx's new corporate parent, AbbVie, the acquisition is a bid to expand beyond its current cash cow, Humira, an arthritis and psoriasis treatment that is also the world's top-selling drug. Reuters notes AbbVie's main U.S. patent on Humira expires in December.""I think that this deal is going to end up looking either very smart or very stupid,"" pharmaceutical expert Derek Lowe noted in a blog after the purchase late last month. ""I have no idea which way this one breaks.""AbbVie will pay for the deal with $5.8 billion in cash and stock. Investors could reap an additional $4 billion in cash if Stemcentrx reaches various success-based milestones, the company said.Speaking of the Stemcentrx's surprisingly high valuation (which is more than competitors Stemline, Verastem and OncoMed combined), CEO Brian Slingerland defended the company's potential by highlighting what it has achieved so far.“This is not an Internet company that was started 18 months ago with a few software developers,"" he told HuffPost. ""There have been close to 200 people at this company, and we’ve been working for eight years, and we’ve been running extensive experiments to be able to yield [these] results."""
6,TECH,Sean Parker's New Mission: Destroy Cancer,Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/sean-parker-interview-cancer-research_us_572a40a3e4b016f37894799e,We spoke to the former Facebook president about his latest venture.,2016-05-10,"The housing case for the IBM Watson computer, which can help doctors diagnose and treat illnesses.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57321108160000e90031e517.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sean Parker knows a thing or two about sharing.In 1999, he cofounded Napster, the notorious file-sharing service that became a household name as people discovered online music piracy for the first time. Parker later became the first president of Facebook, where, of course, more than a billion people regularly share links, media and status updates.But sharing means something different to the 36-year-old entrepreneur now. He's focused on creating a new way for the top minds fighting cancer to coordinate their efforts.Parker is funding rigorous research into immunotherapy, a type of treatment that helps the body's own immune system combat cancer. An alternative to radiation or chemo, immunotherapy has been shown to be effective on certain cancers, though criticisms have surfaced over the treatment's cost and potential side effects.Parker's new initiative also provides a set of tools to researchers at several different centers to create a standardized exchange of information. In short, the new initiative is about creating data and distributing it, something Parker has always been interested in.Of course, he's changed quite a bit from his Napster days.""There are a lot of people like myself who are frustrated that we've been working in consumer Internet for a long time, and that's of dubious long-term significance to humanity,"" Parker told The Huffington Post in an interview last week. ""Maybe it makes sense to focus on things that are a bit more meaningful rather than doing the easy commercial stuff around building products for teenagers.""On May 2, Parker was awarded the 2016 Pontifical Key Philanthropy Award at the Vatican for his contributions to immunotherapy research. HuffPost followed up with Parker to hear more about his latest initiative.First, congratulations on the award. Would you ever have expected anything like this?I don't think you necessarily expect or even go into any of these things imagining that anyone's going to recognize them -- certainly not the Vatican. It's really incredible. It's more important from the perspective of the scientists, researchers and the field of immunotherapy than it is for me personally. The field of immunotherapy has the potential to cure patients. Not even the potential -- it's already providing curative treatments for patients who otherwise weren't treatable.Anything that can be done to draw attention to the power of this specific approach is incredibly helpful to the field. And it's also helpful for patients who need to be able to make an informed choice. They need to be able to go out there and say they want to receive immunotherapy. Why did you become particularly interested in life sciences?There's a general movement amongst Silicon Valley entrepreneurs toward life sciences. There's this feeling that computations and big data are finally at a point where they're converging with the work that's being done in the life sciences, and that convergence moment is driving a lot of enthusiasm. One would expect to have a lot of interest in life science. We're presumably biological beings. And we're all faced with our own mortality. This is something that we should be really interested in.I think people coming from a computer science or an engineering background in Silicon Valley may not feel that their skills were applicable to the field a decade ago, and maybe that applicability is more obvious now. There are a lot of people like myself who are frustrated that we've been working in consumer Internet for a long time, and that's of dubious long-term significance to humanity. Maybe it makes sense to focus on things that are a bit more meaningful rather than doing the easy commercial stuff around building products for teenagers.So much of your mission seems to be based on connecting scientists and fostering collaboration. It strikes me as a little ironic in this era of 24/7 connectivity and communication.I think it's widely understood within the life sciences world that collaboration doesn't take place between centers, or even between researchers as efficiently as it should. One piece of that is data sharing. It's not as straightforward as getting scientists to talk to one another. They do that. They go to conferences, they email one another, they ask questions.But the problems definitely run deeper than just getting them communicating. If you take the problem of data sharing for instance, data sharing -- in order to share data, you need to first be, let's say, measuring the same thing. You need to be recording the same data in multiple clinical trials, in multiple sites, across patients. You need to have standardized ways of measuring the data.If you're not measuring the same thing, then it's not really shareable. That gets at systemic problems with the life sciences world that an outsider coming from another field would initially have a hard time understanding, as I certainly did when I started working in this industry. It's only logical that researchers working on the same problem across many different institutions would be collaborating and taking part in data sharing. In theory that should take place. But practically it's difficult.When you have a consortium, you make sure people have the same tools available, so they can measure the same things. One of the advantages of having a consortium is that you have six centers effectively operating under the same framework. You're able to collect samples in the same way, then you're able to interrogate those samples or conduct tests at different points of time.There's been so much talk about how machine learning and artificial intelligence could improve health care. IBM Watson, for example, says it can connect doctors to research like never before and help develop innovative treatments. What do you think of that model?It's hard to speak specifically to IBM Watson because it feels a little bit like a marketing effort. In life sciences, we're dealing with systems that ultimately, if we had a perfect description of them that was perfectly defined or characterized, then we could build a system and we could do more of the research in a computer system. But we're not at that point yet. There are so many holes in the model of what's in the immune system. It's just incredible how little is known about things where it seems like we already know so much.I think that's everyone's dream -- if we had systems that were really good models of what's happening in the human body in all of its complexity. It would be a heck of a lot easier to interrogate those systems than to do this work in humans. Talk to biologists, they'll tell you we're a lot farther away from that than the computer scientists will tell you. I think personally I was shocked by the complexity or the number of variables that are currently unknown, or interactions that are unknown. It's always a tradeoff between doing the research that you know will be valuable in humans immediately versus doing the long-term discovery efforts that will speed up the process of learning in the future.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

The University of California system does not ask about criminal justice history in its admissions.King's move comes as President Barack Obama attempts to reform the criminal justice system before he leaves office in January. Despite falling crime rates, more than 2 million Americans are imprisoned, the statement said.The resource guide calls for delaying any request for information about involvement in the criminal justice system until after an applicant is admitted to the school.It also urges informing potential students on how to respond to requests about a criminal history and making questions about it more narrowly focused.The Education Department report includes recommendations on how schools might consider applicants' criminal histories and campus safety without discouraging applications for admission.King said that the schools should join the federal government, 23 states, more than 100 cities and counties and many businesses that have reconsidered how they use criminal justice records during hiring.A 2015 study showed that two-thirds of people with felony convictions who started applications at the State University of New York system never finished the process, partly because of requirements for detailing their convictions.By contrast, the attrition rate for all applicants was 21 percent.Terry Hartle, senior vice president for the American Council on Education, which groups about 2,000 two- and four-year colleges and universities, said schools should pay attention to linking social justice issues, like criminal justice reform, to their own standards, such as in the admissions process.""The department has made a useful contribution to that discussion,"" Hartle said.(Reporting by Ian Simpson; Editing by Dan Grebler; Editing by Alan Crosby)"

As we have written before, Trump made a similar remark in a TV interview on Jan. 6, when he claimed Clinton “wants to take everyone’s gun away.”Trump, May 7: Hillary Clinton wants to abolish the Second Amendment. She wants to abolish it. Hillary Clinton wants to take your guns away and she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. She wants to take the bullets away. She wants to take it.Clinton has a gun violence prevention proposal on her website, which would deny gun owners from buying certain guns and block or delay the ability of some to purchase guns. But it does not call for taking any guns away.Among other things, her plan would:Expand background checks. Her proposal would expand required background checks to include some private sales at gun shows and over the Internet. The current requirement exempts any person “who makes occasional sales, exchanges, or purchases of firearms for the enhancement of a personal collection or for a hobby, or who sells all or part of his personal collection of firearms.”Clinton has said her gun proposals are “consistent with constitutional rights,” acknowledging that gun owners have a constitutional right to own guns.Now, Clinton’s critics point to past comments that she has made as evidence that she wants to take away all guns. But these interpretations distort her position.In October, Clinton was asked at a town hall in Keene, New Hampshire, about whether she would consider a gun buyback program like the one that was instituted in Australia after a mass shooting in Tasmania in 1996. In that case, Australia banned certain semi-automatic, self-loading rifles and shotguns, and purchased 640,000 prohibited firearms in a buyback program. Clinton said some U.S. communities have held gun buyback programs and it “would be worth considering” on a national level.Clinton, Oct. 16, 2015: Now communities have done … gun buyback programs. But I think it would be worth considering doing it on the national level if that could be arranged. Remember I know after the terrible ’08 financial crisis, one of the programs that President Obama was able to get in place was cash for clunkers. Remember that? Getting them off the road. It was partly a way to get people to buy new cars, ’cause we want more economic activity, it was partly a way to get old models, that were polluting too much, sort of off the road. So I think that is worth considering. I do not know enough detail to tell you how we would do it, or how it would work, but certainly the Australian example is worth looking at.The National Rifle Association said her comments in Keene proved that the “real goal of gun control supporters is gun confiscation.”But Clinton’s non-committal answer to a hypothetical question at a single campaign stop hardly amounts to proof that she “wants to take your guns away,” as Trump said. She said only that the Australia buyback program is “worth looking at” and “worth considering.” It is not part of her gun violence prevention plan.Trump went a step further this time, saying that Clinton “wants to abolish the Second Amendment.”The evidence for this appears to be a recording of a speech that Clinton gave in New York last year, although Trump’s campaign did not respond to our request for clarification. In that speech, Clinton said that “the Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment, and I am going to make that case every chance I get.”The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website that obtained an audio of her speech,wrote at the time: “Although Clinton did not identify which Supreme Court case she disagreed with, she appeared to be criticizing the landmark 2008 ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller, which found the handgun ban in Washington, D.C., unconstitutional.”Gun rights advocates point to that quote to claim that Trump was right in claiming that Clinton “wants to abolish the Second Amendment.”Asked about Clinton’s remarks about the Second Amendment, Clinton campaign spokesman Josh Schwerin confirmed that Clinton was referring to the Heller case. He said Clinton “believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe.”“Of course Hillary Clinton does not want to repeal the Second Amendment. Donald Trump is simply peddling falsehoods and conspiracy theories in an attempt to divide the American people and win votes,” Schwerin said in an email to us. “Along with the vast majority of Americans, Clinton believes there are common sense steps we can take at the federal level to keep guns out of the hands of criminals while respecting the 2nd Amendment. She also believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe.”In that response to us, the Clinton campaign is echoing, in part, a separate dissenting opinion in Heller written by Justice Stephen Breyer, who wrote that the District had a compelling public safety interest in banning handguns.Nominated by President Bill Clinton, Breyer agreed with the dissenting opinion written by Justice John Paul Stevens that the individual right to keep and bear arms is limited to militia service. There is “no indication that the Framers of the Amendment intended to enshrine the common-law right of self-defense in the Constitution,” Stevens wrote (page 2). But Breyer also wrote a dissent in which he said that even if the Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms for self-defense, the District’s law did not violate the Second Amendment because it “properly seeks to further the sort of life-preserving and public-safety interests that the Court has called ‘compelling’ ” (page 26-27).Breyer wrote that the law did not “disproportionately burden” gun owners for several reasons, including: The ban was “tailored to the life-threatening problems it attempts to address”; it banned “one class of weapons, handguns, leaving residents free to possess shotguns and rifles, along with ammunition”; and it covered an area that “is totally urban.”Schwerin’s statement that “cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe” is consistent with Breyer’s dissent.Schwerin’s statement that Clinton “does not want to repeal the Second Amendment” is consistent with Clinton’s past statements about protecting “constitutional rights of responsible gun owners.” Here are three of them:Clinton, June 20, 2015: Now, I lived in Arkansas and I represented Upstate New York. I know that gun ownership is part of the fabric of a lot of law-abiding communities. But I also know that we can have common sense gun reforms that keep weapons out of the hands of criminals and the violently unstable, while respecting responsible gun owners. What I hope with all of my heart is that we work together to make this debate less polarized, less inflamed by ideology, more informed by evidence, so we can sit down across the table, across the aisle from one another, and find ways to keep our communities safe while protecting constitutional rights.Trump may choose not to believe what Clinton says, but the fact is there is no evidence that Clinton wants to “take your guns away” or “abolish the Second Amendment.” She hasn’t said that, and her gun proposals would not do that."

The effort is admittedly a long shot, according to aides directly involved in it. But they insist it's not as impossible as some members of the GOP and the press perceive it to be. In particular, these aides have begun exploring the idea of suing states over their deadlines for ballot access so they can be afforded more time to field a candidate and gather signatures. Additionally, they are discussing the possibility of launching an entirely new political party rather than latching onto an existing one, since doing so would provide easier passageways for getting on the ballot.""The ballot deadlines are doable, avoidable or hackable,"" said Rick Wilson, a longtime Republican operative who has turned his Twitter feed into a loathe-fest of Donald Trump. ""This is real. There is an actual pathway here,"" he said. ""I think we will know in the next week to 10 days [if this can work], and I think the probability is higher than most people think.""Talk of a third-party run has been percolating for weeks, if not months -- the volume of it directly correlated to the likelihood of a Trump victory -- with the idea being that such a bid could deny both Trump and Hillary Clinton the 270 electoral college votes needed to win (a real long shot) and/or bring Republican voters disaffected by Trump's candidacy out to the polls (more feasible). But it's always been tempered by real-world restrictions.The deadline to appear on the ballot in Texas passed just this Monday, meaning the Lone Star State’s 38 electoral votes are likely out of the picture, absent a successful lawsuit. In addition, between today and the end of June, at least three other states — Illinois, Indiana and North Carolina -- have deadlines, accounting for an additional 34 electoral votes (North Carolina's deadline being the soonest). After June, a third-party candidate would face more and more deadlines for appearing on the ballot -- a task made more difficult due to the patchwork of complex rules and regulations concerning ballot access across the country. “I don’t know whether someone can get on in all 50 states and D.C. But I think it’s still possible to get on enough states through petitioning, to capture 270 electoral votes. I think it’s more than a theoretical possibility,” said Matt Sawyer, a Dallas-based ballot access specialist who was involved in an effort to draft U.S. Marine Corps Gen. James Mattis into the race.Trump's emergence as the Republican Party's presumptive nominee this past week has added urgency to the effort. Joel Searby, a Republican strategist who is directly involved in coordinating a third-party run, said that offers to help from fellow Republicans have amplified in recent days. ""That would be putting it mildly,"" he said.Donors have pledged money; operatives have said they'd help with door knocking and signature gathering; and, most intriguingly, Republican lawyers have volunteered free legal assistance.""I know for a fact that legal challenges are being discussed and prepared for in both [Texas and North Carolina] by folks who would want to make sure there is a path,"" Searby said.Operatives involved with a prospective third-party run believe there is valuable precedent for contesting ballot access laws. During the 1980 presidential campaign, former Illinois Rep. John B. Anderson had sought the Republican presidential nomination before dropping out and declaring his intention to run as an independent candidate. He had already missed deadlines to file to appear on the ballot in five states -- but he circulated petitions for signatures there anyway. In July and August of 1980, he successfully sued to get on the ballot in all five states.Of course, in order to successfully contest ballot access in court, one must have standing to sue. And without a candidate in the race, anti-Trump forces would be hard-pressed to show a judge how a personal legal interest has been invaded by the defendant.“Each day that passes makes a third-party run harder,” said Rick Hasen, an elections law expert who teaches at the University of California, Irvine. “Collecting signatures in states takes time and considerable effort. And as state deadlines pass, it becomes necessary to try to sue in court to get deadlines extended. It would not be easy."" Indeed, Wilson freely admits that one of the biggest hurdles facing the third-party, #NeverTrump movement right now is actually finding a formal leader. And one of the reasons it's proving so difficult is the intense sociopolitical pressure that such a person would have to confront.""Trump is such an asshole, and the people who surround him and his troll army and all this other stuff, they are aggressively dickish to all other forms of human life. So that's clearly in some people's head spaces,"" Wilson said. ""We are looking at other political figures and business figures now. That is where we are focusing our efforts. But it's a tough hill to climb.""Should an actual candidate emerge, he or she would have to decide which party should serve as their banner. While clear options already exist, one available avenue would be simply to start from scratch with a new party (perhaps even named the #NeverTrump Party). In some states, the requirements for appearing on the ballot are less stringent for a candidate of a new party than they are for independent candidates. In Florida, for example, all a party must do to appear on the ballot is submit to the state elections office a list of names and addresses of 29 party officers, including members of its executive committee, and a copy of its constitution. Independent candidates, by contrast, must submit 119,316 signatures no later than July 15 -- an effort that would take considerable time and resources.That’s exactly what Ralph Nader did during the 2008 presidential campaign, when he failed to get on the ballot as an independent in some states. In New Mexico, for example, Nader got on the ballot under the Independent Party, which was made up of his supporters, by submitting one-sixth of the number of signatures normally required of an independent candidate.“These laws are a mess, they’re completely irrational,” said ballot access expert Richard Winger.Searby was notably coy when asked if a full-on new political party was in the works. ""There is no doubt that there are big questions about the future of party politics in America and those questions will be actively researched and discussed,"" he emailed. But Wilson suggested that the anti-Trump forces would explore different party affiliations in different states, should they need to scramble for ballot access.First, however, they must convince the rest of the party that it's worth the time and commitment and the potential fissure with pro-Trump forces. In a reflection of the dire straits the #NeverTrump movement finds itself in, Sen. Ted Cruz, the party’s second-place vote-getter, appeared unconvinced of a last minute third-party bid to deny Trump the presidency.“I don’t think that’s very likely,” Cruz said Tuesday. “It’s always talked about, I don’t think it’s something that’s likely to happen.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

A House committee is holding a hearing on the daily fantasy sports industry, but neither DraftKings nor FanDuel will be present.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Seven months after an “insider trading” scandal engulfed DraftKings and FanDuel, the two largest companies in the growing daily fantasy sports market, Congress is finally set to examine the industry.The House Energy and Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Manufacturing and Trade will hold its first hearing into daily fantasy sports Wednesday morning. But with the election year, the typical slow-moving nature of Congress and especially the absence of the industry’s major players -- no representatives from DraftKings, FanDuel or any major sports leagues will be in attendance, despite invitations -- and legal experts and industry observers don’t expect much immediate concrete action to come out of the proceedings.“My pessimism of there being any significant movement stems from the absence of key stakeholders,” said Daniel Wallach, a shareholder at Florida’s Becker & Poliakoff who specializes in sports gaming. “For Congress to have a hearing on daily fantasy sports without any of the key stakeholders is going to be a challenge. If you're going to have a hearing on sports gambling, you need the NFL, NBA, baseball, hockey, the NCAA. If you’re going to hold a hearing on daily fantasy sports, you need DraftKings and FanDuel.”Rep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), the committee’s ranking Democrat, began calling for hearings into daily fantasy sports in September, around the time the scandal first broke. The scandal raised questions about consumer protections, fraud and other issues inside the daily fantasy sports industry.But the major impetus behind Pallone’s interest was the “murky” legal landscape around daily fantasy sports and the relationships between the industry, major sports leagues and gambling.Despite similarities to traditional sports wagering, which is banned in most states by federal law, DraftKings, FanDuel and other daily fantasy operators have argued that they are legal under a “carveout” in the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act that protects fantasy sports as “games of skill.”Pallone and others in Congress have sought to explore why MLB, the NBA, the NHL and several NFL teams have invested in or partnered with the companies despite the legal uncertainty around the industry and their opposition to legalized sports wagering in an ongoing federal court case involving Pallone’s home state of New Jersey. (Pallone last year introduced legislation to amend the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, another major federal gambling law.)“Fans are currently allowed to risk money on the performance of an individual player,” Pallone said in September. “How is that different than wagering money on the outcome of a game?”Those questions will likely emerge as a key theme of the hearing even without DraftKings and FanDuel present, said Chris Grove, the editor of LegalSportsReport.com, which follows the industry.“This really seems like an opportunity for Congress ... to point out the apparent hypocrisy in a country that has very limited legal sports betting but yet a daily fantasy sports product that is offered legally,” Grove said. “Those two don't seem to comport.”The chairman of the Fantasy Sports Trade Association, a lobbying group that counts both DraftKings and FanDuel as members, will face those questions in their place, and both companies have said in statements that they are comfortable with the FSTA’s representation.Aside from the gambling issue, the informational hearing could be a starting point for discussions about many of the questions that arose during the scandal, including whether the companies have adequate consumer protections, internal data and security controls, and fraud prevention measures in place. Those questions in particular, Wallach suggested, could lead to future hearings or inquiries.Congress could also explore the potential need for federal regulation of daily fantasy sports.At least 30 states have considered legislation to oversee daily fantasy sports operators in the last year. Four states -- Virginia, Mississippi, Tennessee and Indiana -- have already approved new laws to legalize and regulate the industry. Attorneys general and gaming commissions in other states have either declared that daily fantasy contests are illegal gambling or provided guidelines for making it legal. Another five or six states could pass laws by the end of the year, Grove said.“The subcommittee appears to have concerns about the contradictory nature of the state legislation that has begun to emerge,” Wallach said. “The key question is whether Congress should step in.”Opinions differ among daily fantasy observers about whether there is a need for Congress to regulate the industry. But even those who prefer federal oversight concede that the most immediate action is likely to occur on the state level, at least until Congress gains a better understanding of ""the size of the industry and how the business model works,"" said Daniel Etna, the co-chair of the Sports Law Group at New York's Herrick Feinstein LLP. “I think it’s crying out for federal regulation,” Etna said. “But I’m not willing to bet heavily that they’re going to take up this issue and pass federal regulation.” "

I apologize to them today,"" Bloomberg said at a New York staff meeting attended by politics staffers and high-ranking executives, according to a source present. ""I shouldn't have done it.""Bloomberg's apology came five days after he playfully dubbed the journalists “Haldeman and Ehrlichman,” a reference to disgraced Nixon officials H.R. Haldeman and John Ehrlichman. Though Bloomberg may have intended to be glib, the nickname was understandably interpreted negatively inside the Washington bureau, where it was privately uttered, and as word filtered outside the newsroom walls. In a Tuesday afternoon memo to staff, Bloomberg explained that his comment was intended to be ""light-hearted.""""My jocular comparison of them to the Nixon-era political operatives who had a reputation for being tough, direct and edgy, was thought disparaging by some,"" Bloomberg wrote in the memo, obtained by The Huffington Post. ""It was not meant that way; and in retrospect, perhaps I should have expected someone to take it out of the light-hearted spirit in which it was meant. And I could have been more artful in how I phrased it. As I said in the meeting, I am sorry that I said something that was perceived as disparaging. Now let’s get back to covering this election with one of the best teams in the business.""The Washington Post's Erik Wemple first reported on Bloomberg's apology. In the memo, Bloomberg described Halperin and Heilemann as ""talented, 'take no prisoners,' hard-hitting, honest journalists who call things as they see them"" and said he was a ""devotee"" of their daily TV show, ""With All Due Respect."" (Bloomberg similarly expressed his devotion to the show last fall following a report he'd soured on it). And he praised the reporters, editors and producers involved in election coverage -- from ""With All Due Respect,"" to the Bloomberg Politics site, to its subscription-based terminal -- for ""doing a tremendous job covering the hugely important story of the presidential election.""A Bloomberg spokeswoman declined to comment.Bloomberg also addressed his speculation last week that Halperin and Heilemann, authors of buzzy 2008 and 2012 election books Game Change and Double Down, would likely depart after the election to write another post-election tome. Inside Bloomberg, staffers have assumed Halperin and Heilemann might write another post-election book, though the authors currently have no publishing deal. But speculation coming from Bloomberg himself raised concerns among staff over what political coverage and TV programming will look like after the election -- and whether they'd have jobs after November. ""In a private, internal, off-the-record discussion on the future of political news coverage after the current horse race is over, some apparently took exception to my speculation as to what will have popular appeal,"" he wrote. ""Only the future will tell that story.""He said Bloomberg will assess its political coverage and TV programming after the 2016 election is over, which is common for news organizations to do. ""What the future holds for WADR, Bloomberg Politics, and them, we will determine after the election season,"" Bloomberg said. ""I pointed out that they will have myriad opportunities to tell the story they cover for us across our platforms -- and that does not preclude continuing WADR as is on Bloomberg TV."""

The 62-year-old, who was released from prison in 1972, had been trying to register for the past eight years but had been stymied repeatedly by Virginia’s strict felony disenfranchisement law. Barbee was able to register Thursday because Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe signed an executive order on April 22 restoring voting rights to over 200,000 people with past felony convictions who have completed their supervised probation or parole. Previously, ex-offenders had to individually petition the governor to be re-enfranchised. “I had just gave up on the system, period, for trying to help me get registered,” he told The Huffington Post. After he finished filling out the registration form, he turned to his wife. “I feel like a citizen now,” he told her.Karen Fountain, an organizer with New Virginia Majority, a civic engagement organization, has been registering ex-offenders at a brisk pace since before McAuliffe’s order. She is one of 60 organizers doing voter registration work for the group across the state. On Thursday, she spotted a line of people waiting in the rain for a free lunch outside the Greater Mount Moriah Baptist Church. Fountain followed the crowd into the church’s basement. There, she took over a table and placed a registration form and pen at each seat. She guided a woman through filling out her registration form and then invited the rest of the people in the room to come over and register after they finished eating. The woman who just completed her form did a happy dance in her seat as Fountain told the group that those ex-offenders who were no longer on parole and probation could vote. “It’s wonderful to see them know that they do belong, that they have all their civil rights given back to them,” Fountain said. New Virginia Majority has registered over 550 ex-offenders since the governor signed his order, or a quarter of the roughly 2,100 ex-offenders who have registered statewide. Virginia had one of the most punitive felony disenfranchisement laws in the nation before McAuliffe signed his order. Iowa, Florida and Kentucky are now the only states to permanently disenfranchise people with past felony convictions.Fountain often encounters ex-offenders who are incredulous about McAuliffe’s order, so she keeps a copy of The Washington Post from the day after McAuliffe signed it as proof that it actually happened. While headlines in articles about McAuliffe’s order refer to the people affected by it as “felons,” Fountain emphasizes to those she helps register that there should be an “ex” before the noun used to describe them. Republicans in the state legislature immediately objected to McAuliffe’s move to re-enfranchise ex-offenders and threatened to file a lawsuit against the governor, arguing that his sweeping order violates the state Constitution by restoring citizenship rights all at once to ex-offenders who are no longer on parole and probation. The Virginia GOP leadership suggested that McAuliffe’s restoration of rights was meant to benefit Democrats, since 1 in 5 African-Americans in Virginia are unable to vote and racial minorities, who make up a significant chunk of those who will benefit from McAuliffe’s order, don’t tend to gravitate to Republicans. But disenfranchising ex-offenders was an inherently political move in the first place, more than a century ago. White political leaders -- the Democrats of the time -- viewed black men who were able to vote during Reconstruction as a threat, so came up with ways to disenfranchise as many as possible. Carter Glass, a Virginia state senator, said after the state’s constitution enshrined felon disenfranchisement into law in 1902 that poll taxes, literacy tests and felon disenfranchisement would “eliminate the darkey as a political factor in this State … so that in no single county of the Commonwealth will there be the least concern felt for the complete supremacy of the white race in the affairs of government.” While some voting rights advocates fear that Republicans could get a preliminary injunction to halt the registration of ex-offenders in Virginia, Fountain isn’t worried. “If we have any time pressure, that’s because we’re trying to get as many people as possible registered to vote, not so much because they are going to sue,” she said.“We are moving as fast as we can at this point,” Jon Liss, New Virginia Majority’s co-executive director, told HuffPost.Fountain has recently registered people like Harry Coleman, who spent 10 years in prison for armed robbery in 1986. He was a singer in a soul group called Edge of Daybreak that recorded an album while he and the other members were incarcerated. Disenfranchising ex-offenders has the effect of robbing them of a sense of dignity when they return to their homes after they are released. The American Probation and Parole Association says that restoring voting rights to ex-offenders helps them reintegrate into society and therefore improve public safety by reducing recidivism rates. “You feel less than a citizen, less of a person, when you can’t vote,"" said Coleman, whose state supervision ended in 2003. ""You have no say with what’s going on in your life.""He was feeling particularly joyful when HuffPost visited his home in Richmond. “I can vote for Hillary [Clinton] or vote for Donald [Trump], I can do either one that I choose, although I think it’s time for a female to get in there, I ain’t too hot on Donald with all that stuff he’s talking about,” he said. “I’ve got freedom to do whatever I want to do.” "

Disenfranchising ex-offenders has the effect of robbing them of a sense of dignity when they return to their homes after they are released. The American Probation and Parole Association says that restoring voting rights to ex-offenders helps them reintegrate into society and therefore improve public safety by reducing recidivism rates. “You feel less than a citizen, less of a person, when you can’t vote,"" said Coleman, whose state supervision ended in 2003. ""You have no say with what’s going on in your life.""He was feeling particularly joyful when HuffPost visited his home in Richmond. “I can vote for Hillary [Clinton] or vote for Donald [Trump], I can do either one that I choose, although I think it’s time for a female to get in there, I ain’t too hot on Donald with all that stuff he’s talking about,” he said. “I’ve got freedom to do whatever I want to do.” "

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Dan LevineSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Drivers who worked for ride-hailing service Uber [UBER.UL] in California and Massachusetts over the past seven years would have been entitled to an estimated $730 million in expense reimbursements had they been employees rather than contractors, according to court documents made public on Monday.The figure was calculated by attorneys for drivers in a class action against the company, based on a standard rate for mileage reimbursement set by the U.S. government, and on data provided by Uber. Uber disputes the idea that drivers would ever be entitled to that reimbursement rate.Uber and smaller rival Lyft are attempting to settle legal actions by drivers who contend they should be classified as employees and therefore entitled to reimbursement for expenses, including gasoline and vehicle maintenance. Drivers currently pay those costs themselves.The proposed Uber settlement would pay drivers up to $100 million. A San Francisco federal judge must decide whether that deal is fair, and the total potential damages at play in the lawsuit will likely bear on his analysis.According to attorneys for the drivers, the total value of driver claims in the Uber case is $852 million, which includes a tips claim. Uber calculates the total value of plaintiff claims at $429 million.The $100 million Uber settlement represents about 12 percent of potential $852 million in damages, or about 23 percent of $429 million.Lyft had agreed to settle its class action for $12.25 million, but a separate federal judge rejected the deal because it represented only about 9 percent of the potential value of drivers' claims.While the deal does not elevate drivers to employees, attorneys for drivers have defended it, saying they faced significant risks had the case moved forward. They also say drivers who have worked several months could be entitled to thousands of dollars each under the settlement.Beyond the money, Uber Technologies Inc also agreed to a new policy governing driver termination, including an appeals process for drivers terminated by Uber. The privately held company will also clarify that drivers do not automatically receive gratuities from their fares and will allow them to solicit tips.Additionally, the company agreed to assist with the creation of a drivers' association. Those nonmonetary commitments expire in two years.(Editing by Matthew Lewis)"

Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said Sunday that if Hillary Clinton wins the presidency in November, Republicans should hurry up and confirm President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland.""If we come to a point, I have said all along, where we're going to lose the election or we lose the election in November, then we ought to approve him quickly,"" Flake said on NBC's ""Meet the Press."" ""I’m certain that he'll be more conservative than a Hillary Clinton nomination, come January.""The Arizona Republican's remarks are out of step with his party leaders, who have said unequivocally that they will block Garland's nomination and hold the Supreme Court seat open for the next president.A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) declined to comment.GOP leaders have put themselves in an awkward predicament over the court seat, which has been empty since February. If they keep blocking Garland, a moderate pick with little opposition on his merits, they risk a more liberal pick from Clinton or a total wildcard nominee from Donald Trump. There's also a decent chance Republicans will lose the Senate in November, which would give them a weaker hand in deciding who moves forward at all.Flake isn't the only GOP senator open to voting on Obama's nominee in the lame duck session. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has said he would support voting on Garland, too, if Clinton wins in November. That's in addition to two other Republican senators, Mark Kirk (Ill.) and Susan Collins (Maine), saying Garland should get hearings now.The Huffington Post reached out to 24 Republican senators last week to see if they really prefer holding the Supreme Court seat open for Clinton or Trump, versus voting on Garland. Five responded. They all said yes."
