0,TASTE,4 of Hong Kong's Hippest New Restaurants,"La Carmina, ContributorTravel TV host, fashion blogger at lacarmina.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/4-of-hong-kongs-hippest-new-restaurants_b_5653530.html,"From ""sexy naked rolls"" to ""magic mushroom maki,"" here's what the innovators are serving up.",2014-08-07,2014-08-06-140629hongkongsushibestrestaurants3.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-08-06-140629hongkongsushibestrestaurants3-thumb.jpg,"Much like the city, Hong Kong's food scene is ambitious and fast-paced. Chefs are constantly launching new restaurants with bold concepts that fuse Eastern and Western influences. Last month, I ate my way through four of Hong Kong's newest restaurants. I discovered that chefs are putting creative spins on sushi -- such as toasting rice with butter -- and investing in specialized equipment like Josper ovens. Interior decor is as important as ever, with an emphasis on modern art and soaring views of the harbor. From ""sexy naked rolls"" to ""magic mushroom maki,"" here's what the innovators are serving up. (All photos copyright La Carmina.)Naked Gurume GyarariNaked  calls itself a ""gourmet gallery"" that celebrates both food and design. Chef Justin Chan stunned me with Japanese tapas-style dishes that look like art and surprise the senses. The restaurant's name refers to stripping down ingredients, but his flavor combinations were anything but minimalist. I started with a salad of Okinawan ice leaves with scallops, a wonderful pairing that let me savor the glistening, naturally salty crystals. Many dishes are inspired by Chef Chan's childhood memories, like fried oysters in a traditional dim sum basket. His Sexy Naked Roll, or seared tuna on butter-toasted rice, was a standout.  Sushi TōCelebrated local chef Harlan Goldstein opened Sushi To in Causeway Bay earlier this year. Originally from New York, the chef is a strong and passionate personality. He has lived in Hong Kong since the 1970s, and locals can't get enough of his restaurants.Known for his European fine dining establishments, this is this first foray into Japanese cuisine. Sushi Tō is located on the 29th floor, with ceiling windows that give a magnificent view of Victoria Harbor. Sushi Tō specializes in omakase, and Harlan prepared a tasting menu for me. I loved the melt-in-your-mouth salmon salad with sesame soy dressing, followed by fresh kampachi and salmon sashimi. His selection encompasses more than raw fish: there are unique takes on robatayaki, teppanyaki and more, with creative ingredients such as konbu, burdock pickle, and seasoned ""magic mushrooms.""One stand-out was the Hokkaido scallop, crab meat clams, shrimp, rice and soup in a stone hot pot. Dessert, a white sesame tiramisu, gave a light and sweet finish. PenthouseUpstairs is Harlan's Penthouse, which also opened this year. The chef is as hands-on as it gets: I saw him working right in the kitchen, alongside his staff. Harlan took a break to sit with my table, and we chatted over bourbon cocktails called ""Wall St After 5pm.""He described his vision for a cosmopolitan East meets West establishment, set in what looks like a hip Manhattan studio. His no-fuss menu draws from Italian rustic flavors, like hand-crafted pastas, heirloom tomato tartare with burrata and balsamic jelly, and black ink paella with scallops and crisp baby squid. Penthouse's celebrated Spanish pork ribs, slow-cooked in a Josper oven/grill that heats up to 500 degrees, were juicy and fell right off the bone. Mama SanChef Will Meyrick's original Mama San was a hit in Bali, leading to his first outpost in Hong Kong. Found in one of the busiest areas of Lan Kwai Fong, the interior sets the mood: Indonesian home-style meets young nightlife. The menu's southeast Asian spices stirred my senses: coconut, Thai basil, chilis, kaffir lime. I whet my appetite with cassava chips dipped in tartar, then enjoyed the salt-crusted barramundi fish stuffed with lemongrass pandan and basil. Mama San's enticing cocktail menu consists of classics with a twist. My go-to, the ""Dark & Stormy"", was served with house ginger beer, orange bitters and lime in a paper bag.For more Hong Kong food and travel posts, check out La Carmina blog."
1,COLLEGE,Student Debt May Have A Bigger Impact On Your Life Than You Realize,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/student-debt-well-being_n_5656265.html,,2014-08-07,"People walk at Princeton University in Princeton, N.J., Monday, Dec. 9, 2013. The Ivy League school has begun vaccinating nearly 6,000 students to try to stop an outbreak of type B meningitis in an unusual federal government-endorsed administration of a drug not generally approved for use in the United States. Seven students and one prospective student who was visiting campus have been stricken by potentially life-threatening type B meningococcal disease since March. None of the cases has been fatal. (AP Photo/Mel Evans)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae5059260000cf00812aef.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"College undergrads who take on a lot of student loan debt are less likely to thrive in several key areas after graduation, according to a Gallup analysis released Thursday.That one of those areas is their financial well-being seems obvious, but Gallup's report suggests that major student debt tends to burden the graduates' lives well beyond their wallets.The pollster looked at data from a project with Purdue University and the Lumina Foundation that surveyed Americans who graduated from college between 1990 and 2014. They were asked to evaluate multiple statements about their lives on a five-point scale, ranging from ""strongly disagree"" to ""strongly agree.""Those results were then analyzed to see if the graduates were ""thriving,"" ""struggling"" or ""suffering"" in each of five areas of well-being taken from the ongoing Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index. The index currently examines purpose, defined as ""liking what you do each day and being motivated to achieve your goals""; social, defined as ""having supportive relationships and love in your life""; financial, defined as ""managing your economic life to reduce stress and increase security""; community, defined as ""liking where you live, feeling safe and having pride in your community""; and physical, defined as ""having good health and enough energy to get things done daily.""Graduates who had taken on debt of more than $50,000 were more likely than their less-burdened counterparts to be struggling or suffering in four areas: purpose, financial, community and physical. The only area where they were not dragged down was their social well-being.Gallup noted that even after controlling for socioeconomic status (using the common proxy of the mother's highest level of education), the most indebted graduates still had lower ratings in well-being.""Relatively recent college graduates -- those who earned their degree from 2000 to 2014 -- who have more than $50,000 in student debt are significantly less likely to be thriving financially and physically than their counterparts without loans,"" Gallup said. ""They are also less likely to have a strong sense of purpose and to be thriving in their community well-being. Notably, for 2000-2014 graduates, the most indebted degree holders are less likely to be thriving in social well-being, something that is not true of the larger sample.""Graduates' well-being may suffer in part, Gallup suggested, because student debt often leads people to defer major life events, like getting married and buying a home."

This has always been true and it's true now. The German writer W.G. Sebald wrote of the massive trauma the vanquished German population suffered in the wake of World War II, a subject that may have been passed over due to the lack of sympathy for a population that was deemed to have colluded with the Nazis. Daniel Goldhagen wrote a book entitled Hitler's Willing Executioners: Ordinary Germans and the Holocaust. But there are always people living their lives and then politicians and agitators with agendas to be accomplished, often with little regard for the individual suffering that might be incurred by ordinary people. The Times ran a story about a Gaza psychologist with a history of treating trauma victims who himself became one (""In Fatal Flash, Gaza Psychologist Switches Roles, Turning Into a Trauma Victim,"" NYT, 8/4/14). The Times quotes the psychologist, Dr. Hassan al-Zeyada thusly, ""You try to help the people with their suffering. It's totally different when you have the same experience. You lose six from your family--three brothers, your mom, one of your nephews, your sister-in-law. It's really...unexpected.""""He paused, red-eyed,"" is how the Times piece described the ellipsis at the end of the quote. Victims like Dr. Hassan, on both sides of the battles, constitute the real front lines of any armed struggle. Bertolt Brecht's Mother Courage and Her Children took place during the Thirty Years War, yet it tells the same story. War functions as the macrocosm. ""War is merely the continuation of policy by other means,"" said the Prussian general Carl von Clausewitz. You have the queen bees and then the rest of the hive, the microcosm. The hive are those who suffer during wars, who lose their homes, whose children are killed in battle, whose way of life is destroyed. Wars are usually fought over land and resources, but there are also millenarian objectives. Intellectuals are often pictured as doves, but they also often provide the ideological justifications which stoke the fires of military machines. An intellectual may achieve a promotion, as a result of war. And suddenly find himself a statesman! Meanwhile, MacArthur plan or not, the common man is left to clean up the mess.German Democratic Republic Stamp of Berliner Ensemble Production of Mother Courage{This was originally posted to The Screaming Pope, Francis Levy's blog of rants and reactions to contemporary politics, art and culture}"
3,POLITICS,The Butcher's Bill in Gaza: Far Greater than Casualty Figures,"Carlos F. Torres, ContributorThe views of a citizen of the world",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-butchers-bill-in-gaza_b_5654847.html,"In the widely-praised naval series by Patrick O'Brian, following each engagement, Captain Jack Aubrey would ask ship doctor Stephen Maturin ""What is the butcher's bill""? The fictional hero wanted a casualty count.",2014-08-07,2014-08-06-The_home_of_the_Kware_family_after_it_was_bombed_by_the_military.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-08-06-The_home_of_the_Kware_family_after_it_was_bombed_by_the_military-thumb.jpg," In the widely-praised naval series by Patrick O'Brian, following each engagement, Captain Jack Aubrey would ask ship doctor Stephen Maturin ""What is the butcher's bill""?With broken masts and burned decks still smoldering, the dead still warm, and the wounded being treated on a makeshift operating table, the fictional hero wanted a casualty count.The butcher's bill from the latest Israeli war against Gaza is subject to dispute. The New York Times reports about differing counts and methodologies:By Tuesday, this is what they had come up with: 1,865 ""martyrs"" from ""Israeli aggression"" since July 6: 429 under age 18, 79 over 60, 243 women. The Palestinian Ministry of Health does not categorize victims as civilian or combatant, but others do: The United Nations -- which had a lower death toll, 1,814 -- said that at least 72 percent were civilians, while two Gaza-based groups put the percentage at 82 (Al Mezan Center for Human Rights) and 84 (the Palestinian Center for Human Rights).This time around, and far more than in the two previous wars, the butcher's bill should also include other elements.For example, there should be a quantification of the loss of U.S. credibility. A preliminary assessment is not very positive, given that the administration stood silently for most of the carnage, allowing Secretary of State John Kerry to be skewered by the Israeli media in one of visits and taking with a due dose of docility the ""Don't Second Guess me on Hamas"" scolding by Prime Minister Netanyahu.At the same time it was replenishing the Israeli army with grenades, mortar rounds and ammunition.  It wasn't until after the attack on the UN school -- the fifth such attack-- that the State Department finally voiced opposition.The butcher's bill should also include the political costs of the growing clamor for an investigation of war crimes by the state of Israel.It should also include the rise in anti-semitism in Europe and how that plays in the hands of extremism. In many cases the calls for an ends to the violence against the Palestinians in Gaza morphed into denounciations of judaism, rehashing ages-old racist accusations.This latest war will also produce more -- not less -- hatred.In a piece appropriately called ""Israel is Minting the Next Generation of Hate"", The Daily Beast's Jesse Rosenfeld tells us that there are some 900,000 people under 18 in Gaza. Some children in Gaza havae survived 3 such incursions.And concludes that many of these children will face no other alternative but to fight:It is not Hamas propaganda, the school curriculum or even their parents that make these children see a future where continued resistance is the only option for survival. That was an education taught by the Israeli bombs that flattened their homes and by the bread lines across the street from the school.Will the butcher's bill include further loss of credibility for the mainstream media. Pulitzer winner Glenn Greenwald gives them an F for their coverage. He sees their reporting as biased and racist. Amen!Also deserving consideration to be included in the butcher's bill are the effects on Israel claims of a high moral ground. Comments like ""Genocide"", ""slaughter"", ""brutality"" are increasingly used to describe Israel's army. (A blogger talking about ""permissible genocide""; a general calling for a blockade reminiscent of the nazi siege on Leningrad support those arguments).These words from jewish activist Henry Siegman to Democracy Now's Amy Goodman are as profound as it gets.It's disastrous. ... When one thinks that this is what is necessary for Israel to survive, that the Zionist dream is based on the repeated slaughter of innocents on a scale that we're watching these days on television, that is really a profound crisis-and should be a profound crisis-in the thinking of all of us who were committed to the establishment of the state and to its success.""Another element in the butcher's bill, could be the military moral boost on Hamas, their fighters (not ""militants"" as the media calls them) inflicting 67 casualties (in 2008 there were 10) on the once-invincible IDF. As the New York Times notesWhat Israel was apparently less ready for was Hamas fighters who are willing to engage and are trained to use tunnels, a tool of war whose roots go back to antiquity.Of course, Patrick O'Brian writes action novels based on historic facts of the Napoleonic era. And today's massacre in Gaza is real: The dead, the terror and the horrifying cost.And for those who'd like to lower the butcher's bill, perhaps it is time to consider the grievances of all parties involved. With no exceptions.And that means Hamas.Photo: Wikipedia Commons"
4,ENTERTAINMENT,Truth in Character,"James Campion, ContributorPolitical Analyst, 'The Aquarian Weekly'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/truth-in-character_b_5654143.html,"The title of Sinead O'Connor's new album, I Am Not Bossy, I'm The Boss says it all, well, almost. The record echoes like a clenched fist opening into a blooming flower; a return to fierce introspection; the insolent woman looking for tenderness.",2014-08-07,"NEW YORK, NY - FEBRUARY 23: Musician Sinead O'Connor performs at the Highline Ballroom on February 23, 2012 in New York City. (Photo by Jason Kempin/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d195eb3b0000f622ec4156.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sinead O'Connor's Musical Catharsis: I'm Not Bossy, I'm The BossWhile visiting Dublin in early June, the wife and I came upon a mural painted on the side of the city's Hard Rock Café tucked within a phalanx of ancient pubs in the Temple Bar district. It was a beautiful rendering of a doe-eyed Sinead O'Connor peering from beneath a shawl, appearing as if a stricken Madonna. Above the image, damaged slightly by what looked like a heavy object having been hurled into the cement by her neck, was written; ""Sinead you were right all along, we were wrong. So sorry.""What Sinead O'Connor may have represented or said that at first came off as ""wrong"" but was later seen by the artist or her fellow Irish citizens as ""right"" is left to the imagination. But it matters little. For Sinead O'Connor has never been timid about speaking her mind, in song or in person, embodying the deviant contrarian that many of us at first may bristle -- How dare she!, but later wonder how we missed being stricken by the same passionate outrage. Sinead O'Connor. The mere name conjures controversy. For 30 years her career as punk provocateur, spiritual radical, unflinching feminist and social marauder has set her apart; for good or ill. The siren vocalist of poignant songs that pierce through the treacle of most rock sentiments never sought refuge in art; instead she draped her music about her personal and public life as a second skin. Perhaps it was always the presentation that preceded her -- defiant glare of those enormous green eyes that leap from beneath the shimmering bald scalp extenuated by a menacing scowl that occasionally gives pause for a child-like giggle, as if half the bravado is act and the other id. This is why Sinead O'Connor is a hero of mine, for her life collides with her art; her persona a canvas. Whether emotionally charged performances or combative interviews, hers is the complete package. There is no gimmick. If it were then her enormously zealous heart-over-mind sense of expression would not have needed a painted apology nor would it have at times rendered her a pariah despite an otherwise impressive run of success on the charts and inside pop culture.But it all pales in the wake of her incredible work, the most striking, 1990's I Do Not Want What I Haven't Got (Yeah, the one with ""Nothing Compares To U"", which is Prince's finest song, but only a glimpse of what explodes from that record). There is not one time in a hundred spins of the gut-wrenching, ""Three Babies"" that chills don't shoot through my nervous system as she clutches the high notes for ""The face on you/The smell of you/ Will always be with me"". It may be the most haunting eight seconds ever recorded and only begins to lift the veil on a complicated soul.Over the years, O'Connor has openly discussed and written extensively about the abuse she suffered as a child leading to her expression of disgust with the Catholic Church's refusal to root out pedophiles -- specifically in Ireland, which might explain the mural -- which led to her infamous ripping up a photograph of Pope John Paul II on Saturday Night Live in October of 1992, the first of many very sudden and very public heart-over-mind moments that has overshadowed her music. The title of O'Connor's new album, I Am Not Bossy, I'm The Boss says it all, well, almost. The record echoes like a clenched fist opening into a blooming flower; a return to fierce introspection; the insolent woman looking for tenderness. The first verse from the album's opening song, ""How About I Be Me"" reveals a vulnerability behind being ""the boss"": ""Always gotta be the lioness/Taking care of everybody else/A woman like me needs love/A woman like me needs a man to be/Stronger than herself"". She sings time and again on several tracks about transcendent kisses and ""making love"", as if hidden salvation. I Am Not Bossy strips bare the public persona of the angered rebel, but not entirely. It strategically traverses the tightrope of irreverent brashness and tender yearning on twelve compelling numbers ranging from seductive ballads to confessional angst. The great bowery poet, Charles Bukowski once wrote, ""My days, my years, my life has seen up and downs, lights and darknesses. If I wrote only and continually of the ""light"" and never mentioned the other, then as an artist I would be a liar."" And it is in this search for the duality of truth in art that I sat down for a chat with O'Connor, some ten years in the making.jc: This is something of a Holy Grail for me, speaking with you. For some reason our planned interviews always seemed to get derailed. You're my hero because you never dismiss the human condition in your work or philosophy, even when considering politics, religion or social issues. That is an enviable trait.Sinead: Well, thanks. Let's start with the record. It appears after several listens to be a combination of catharsis and introspection, much like most of your work, but this time it has an exhaling quality to it; a sense of relief -- for instance many of the songs are short and sweet, barely running three minutes. They get right to the point, as if shoved out of your psyche. What was your frame of mind when you wrote and then recorded this material?There are three songs that are personal/autobiographical; ""How About I Be Me"", ""Dense Water Deeper Down"" and ""8 Good Reasons"". The others are not my frame of mind, but the characters'. In the same way the Aretha Franklin album, I Never Loved A Man The Way I Loved You is the story of a relationship, when you listen to it in sequence, I wanted to echo that. And so there are perhaps three or four female characters on the record, but there is one that appears more often than the others. She's the cathartic one. She's on a journey to learn the difference between illusion and reality when it comes to discovering love, and her catharsis comes when she discovers it was herself she was longing for the whole time. The earlier songs where she is longing for this particular man are conversations between her and this guy, but she comes to the conclusion at the end of it all that it is not him she is longing for but her. (laughs) That's a bit of a longwinded explanation, but you hit the nail on the head in terms of it being a catharsis. It's just not mine. It's a character that I've created.  You play around quite a bit with Hindu references on this record, ""The Vishnu Room"" being an obvious one, but I am interested in your use of Maya in ""Harbour"". You sing;""And they said call it Maya/Go ahead call it Maya/But it's not all Maya"" -- Maya being a Hindu word or symbol for illusion or delusion, to overcome the foolishness of posing or hiding and find the ""true self"", which appears to be another central theme to these songs. Yeah, it is the central theme. These characters...if you like, you can say represent every woman or every man, indeed, but there are a set of characters which represent the psyche of the main character, who is the female character that turns up on ""Your Green Jacket"", then ""The Vishnu Room"", 'The Voice of My Doctor"", ""Harbour"" and ends up with ""Streetcars"". And through this song sequence there is this journey of longing for this guy whom she has projected all this stuff on and I suppose he is Maya, as he is always present, the same way the man in the Aretha Franklin record is always present throughout the album. And she has an experience with him, which leads her to understand he is not the man she thought he was, which doesn't mean he's a bad person, but she got a fright because he wasn't what she had deluded herself into thinking he was. But instead of taking this as some dreadful thing, it leads her to discover that in fact it was herself she was longing for. So that description there of Maya...yeah, that's it. That's what the central character is going through. The song also evokes something I know you have used your career to shed light upon and that is child abuse, mostly institutional child abuse, and I couldn't help thinking of that theme when listening to the lines; ""Fumbling to get back what's stolen/Thinking pain could be plastered over"".Yeah, those conversations between characters set off something in my mind, because I'm what you might call a Stanislavski ""method actor"" singer/songwriter. What happened with the last album, some of the songs were written when people had given me movie scripts and I started then to write songs from the point of view of these characters. I enjoyed that, but I didn't give the movie people the songs. So I created a scenario in my mind and based the character on someone I met in Holland, a young girl, and invented this story where the man on the record asks her about the marks she has on her and the song is an explanation of how she has these marks on her. It's supposed to be left to the imagination. It's part of her explaining to him that she is beginning to understand that she has been projecting this longing for things that she didn't get growing up and she had perhaps projected onto men or the idea of a man who will come and rescue her and make everything wonderful. She realizes that's not how things go, which ties up with the whole Maya thing. Speaking of this Stanislavski ""method acting"" style of getting into character to sing; your voice sounds as strong and emotive as ever; it still gives me chills. There is always a moment or two or three in every record where you go to a place deep inside to get to that intense vocal expression. Where does that come from? It's very hard to explain, because if you could describe music you wouldn't need music. It's kind of second nature, so it's hard to describe to someone else. It's like taking a breath. You do what you do. I'm sure every singer would tell you how much they wish they could put words on that, because there's nothing more interesting to talk about than singing. For me, I just go into a world of my own and if you go into the Stanislavski method, as I call it, you get into the character -- the who, what, where, when and why -- and you forget you're on a stage and forget there are people there and you get to who you are in the song, where you are, what is it you're trying to say, who is it you're trying to say it to and how you're trying to say it. (laughs) But the big difference between this and actual method acting is you only stay in that character for three minutes, because you've got to sing another character in three minutes. (laughs)  Speaking of characters, the record's cover photo of you in the shiny black dress and the black wig evokes a visual way to depict a character or maybe it reflects your foolish side or perhaps your true self.Yeah, exactly. I think that's a very important aspect of it. It's a poetic aspect, and what I mean by that is it's a subtext, and I've done about 150 interviews already and you were the only one who managed to pick that up, although one person asked me if I was trying to disguise myself and I said, ""Well, maybe the other has been a disguise."" (laughs)  I have to compliment you on your confronting suicide on ""8 Good Reasons"", which is such an arresting song that within it you actually question the idea of broaching it. You sing; ""Don't know if I should quite sing this song/Don't know if it maybe might be wrong/But then again it maybe might be right/To tell you 'bout the bullet and the red light"". It's a beautifully harsh sentiment.In the case where songs are very personal it becomes subconscious when you write them. You don't really know why you wrote it, you just had to write it. I was working with a guitar player named Graham Kearns and he wrote the music for the song and sent it to me. I don't know...I just felt I had to write it. (chuckles) My favorite way of writing is when someone gives me a piece of music. When I hear the music I see pictures or think of things, whether they're personal or imaginary things, and once I heard what Graham had given me I was immediately inspired by it. Can you reveal the 8 good reasons that are worth sticking around for? They were my children's eyes.Ha! That's fantastic. (laughs) Yeah.  I recently saw a television interview with you where you discussed the dangerous vagaries of the Internet, the meanness of it, the random, anonymous vitriol of it all. I wonder if that kind of bullying is something that hits home with you. Well, Jesus, look what's going on in Israel. It goes on in people's sitting rooms because it goes on outside and vice versa. It's not only on the Internet, is it? People aren't very nice to one another.I saw a mural of you on the street in Temple Bar when I was in Dublin last month. On it was written, I presume by the artist, ""Sinead you were right all along, we were wrong. So sorry."" Can you shed some light on this?I wonder who painted it! (laughs) I'll tell you what, if John Paul II or Ratzinger (Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger aka Pope Benedict XVI) did it I'd be real happy. It's lovely. I've seen it. It's very special to me. I'd really love to know who did it. I have framed and hanging in my office the cover of the NY Daily News the day after you tore a picture of Pope John Paul II and that was, for me, a touchtone moment of speaking truth to power. And later we learned it was your vehement protest against the Church's cover-up of decades of child abuse. I wonder if you believe this is a battle that will ever be won or will it rage on long after we're gone.No, I don't think it will be a battle long after we're gone because I believe in the Christian scriptures and it's all written down exactly what's going to happen. So, to put it briefly and more in a metaphorical form: Rain falls from the sky, stuff comes up from under the ground. As Jesus said; ""Nothing is hidden that won't be revealed and nothing is kept secret that won't be made known."" I think we can all sit back and relax, because I believe in the scriptures and all will eventually be revealed.  Will you be touring the record here in the states?Yeah, we're coming there in October and again in November. You know -- one side of the states the first time and another side the second time. (laughs) Well, it really is a wonderful record and seems to be a creative rebirth for you; new label (Nettwerk) and all. I wonder if you feel that.I really do. Very much so. Brilliant record company. Brilliant record. John Reynolds being the most fantastic producer ever and I think very strong songs and a great songwriting team we have together. It's another beginning for me as a songwriter."

If we were not talking about Beyoncé for the umpteenth time, we were talking about Iggy Azalea. And while there were a few articles that had legitimate concerns about the reigning musical superstar, most were just repetitive banter that went nowhere. By now, we get it, old-school hip-hop connoisseurs: you think Ms. Azalea is an untalented white rapper that doesn't fit your conventional idea of what the genre should be. And to my generation who constantly jump on the bandwagon of trashing her and acting as though race is the only thing giving her the upper advantage of knocking out other female MCs, guess again.I place the blame on the current state of female hip-hop, the forever growing resistance for music taste to evolve and us, the consumers. First, I am not at all saying that Iggy Azalea is a saint. She obviously has committed some grave offenses in some of her lyrics and does indeed deserve to be called out like any other rapper who does such. However, perhaps she is receiving more shade for being the Little Red Riding Hood who stepped into the hip-hop woods of pre-defined blackness. Because, you know... people now feel they have the authority to accuse others of inserting an entire subculture of race dialect into music. People are mad that Iggy Azalea has a #1 Billboard Hot 100 record, something that Nicki Minaj has never had and only been the runner up to twice with such hits as ""Super Bass"" and ""Starships."" It was those mainstream appeals that took Nicki Minaj away from giving us her mixtape rawness in replacement for a more popish sound. Which brings me to my next point: if it was okay for Nicki to leave hip-hop and take a quick visit to pop... why are we so mad that Iggy Azalea has done the same? I hope her being white isn't the only real cause for it.The current state of female hip-hop edge has declined due to the evolution of them crossing over the pop sound bridge... and that was before Azalea stepped in the studio. We would be hypocrites if we are to badger Iggy for not coming hard enough in her lyricism and not put Nicki in check for turning her back on redefining the genre that she so now feels the audacity to make judgment calls for. No, no, no shade, Ms. Minaj, but when we are talking about ""authenticity,"" I think Lil Kim is somewhere having a legitimate reason to raise an eyebrow. Which only heightens the issue when outside of Iggy, the rest of the black female MCs are beefing or taking shots at one another while she is able to focus on solidifying her presence. While Lil Kim continues to go after Nicki Minaj and the former still feels the need to throw jabs as well, are they not recognizing that they are hurting the unity of the very genre they hold so high in regard against Ms. Azalea?Which brings me to my next point: music is an art form that no one truly has the agency to control its evolution. What annoys me about many of the music critics out here criticizing Iggy Azalea's success is that they have yet to talk about the other times in music when artists mixed it up. Let's instead spend more time discussing how R&B has seriously taken a different turn with Chris Brown trying to rap more in songs than sing or how Trey Songz latest album really was more of a soft hip-hop record than a more vocal-filled sound piece. Music changes with the fads and trends of what an artist and society wants. I still stand by the belief that it wouldn't be hot if people weren't buying it.That takes me to my final point: consumers, if we want better music... we have to actually buy it. I'm not making a judgment call on whether or not Iggy Azalea is ""real hip-hop"" or not. I personally enjoy ""Fancy"" and when I jam out to it, I don't necessary place the taste in whether or not she is conventionally rapping like the great MCs of the past or not. I just find the song to be a fun tune to bop to. For those out there who disagree, how about consume more of the artist that you like instead of constantly bashing the young MC. New Rule: for every time you see someone on social media post a link to an Iggy Azalea song, instead of commenting, just promote the artist you think is better and hopefully enlighten those who don't know about them. Because all of this press about her is only going to cement her presence in an industry that you feel she doesn't belong in. And that is why all these articles about Iggy Azalea are pointless. The song is personally catchy and while others will hate me for saying this... it will also not be the downfall as to why hip-hop will decline. It will be in the constant petty beefs and disappointing pop transformations of hip-hop heavyweights. It will be in the resistance not to embrace new sounds and recognize that it does not necessarily speak to the relevance of another. It will be in how consumers choose what is hot and what is not by spending more time bashing one artist while not supporting their personal favorite.It will not be Iggy Azalea, for although I do personally enjoy the fun she brings to music, I know she most likely won't last too long unless she mixes it up. But once she takes that step outside the limelight, it will still not fix the overarching problem. We will need to do more instead of finding another scapegoat as for why hip-hop is in the mess that it is now.It's time for a real intervention.I'm down."

They were the ""single mom"" kayaks I bought on Craigslist because they were light and I could actually lift them up the steps and onto the rack that held them. I could never have predicted they would be the sort of vessels that would have steel poles lashed to them. The waves kept crashing as I did what little I could to hold the 500 pounds of steel in place without having it land on my toes as Jim struggled to strap everything together.Finally, the new contraption, looking like a lopsided letter H was set and I handed him the small outboard motor and the wooden brace that the motor would clamp onto. I handed him a lifejacket that was too small for him to strap around his chest. He pushed off and floated away, but thirty feet away from the ramp, he had to jump off and hold the ""vessel"" so it wouldn't capsize in the wake of a passing ferry. He jumped back on and continued his journey of doom.We both knew this expedition wasn't going to end well. I made some new friends near the boat launch who became his rescuers when the 500 pounds of steel and the outboard sank to the bottom of the sound. Turns out one of the kayaks was missing a drain plug.There was an early morning low-tide rescue of the motor and later, a lower-tide rescue of the steel. This time it was lashed to the underside of the kayak and rowed safely to our beach in calm water.Of course, all this steel and effort was to build a davit (a hoist) on our bulkhead so his homemade kit seaplane could be hauled onto land whenever he taxis into the beach. Did I mention this is a plane that has never flown? Jim has spent the last year rebuilding the engine, creating cockpit instruments by reprogramming a Kindle Fire, restringing wiring, cutting wing bits out of foam, welding a custom trailer to name just a few of the tasks.With each new plane adventure I wonder how much closer the plane is to actually flying. The adventures make the reality of flight seem far away and yet I am aware that the possibility of Jim flying hundreds of feet in the air in a tiny cockpit is very real.It turns out my boyfriend is a real-life McGyver type. Oddly, I used to think of Arron as a McGyver type as well. I seem to fall in love with guys who do things in unconventional ways. I enjoy being part of the engineering team, trying to figure out angles and weights when trying to figure out how to haul 500 pounds. of steel pipe onto an inaccessible beach.But Arron didn't take risks in quite the same way as Jim. Arron didn't like flying much. Or tall buildings. He wouldn't have skied over a cliff or parachuted out of an airplane. And yet despite his adversity to risk, he died doing something that was supposed to be safe. Ah, the irony.Jim is aware of how his lifestyle might affect my state of well-being. After the kayak incident, he explained that he takes risks on things that have consequences that are acceptable (like losing an outboard in the sound that can then be hauled out, cleaned and returned to full working order). In his work, he sees people on a daily basis who take stupid risks with much higher consequences. Drinking and driving, firecrackers set off in an apartment hallways, driving in the fast lane and texting to name a few.Jim always drives in the slow lane. He's seen too many fast lane accidents and isn't willing to drive in a lane where there is no exit strategy (the shoulder). Despite his job being risky, there are so many safety procedures in place, that at times, firefighters can't even make the rescues they are trained for and have to stand by helplessly and watch as someone meets their fate.Recently, Michelle Neff Hernandez of Soaring Spirits wrote about her new marriage and her fears about her new husband's possible death. I was struck by how much this resonated with me. She writes,No, I haven't gotten over the fear that Michael might die. I choose to love him knowing that he will die. Dealing with the fear that this rebuilt life will also end way too soon has been one of the most challenging things about remarrying. I can't un-know what death has taught me. So, when someone says, 'Michael hasn't called, but I am sure he is fine.' My brain says, 'Phil was fine, too, and then he was dead.' And yet a part of it didn't resonate. I am surprised to realize that I don't have the same kind of worry about Jim, which is weird given his lifestyle. I think it's that if Jim were to die, I know I could handle it. I don't want that to happen of course, but I know, deep down that I have the strength to deal with the grief.What I admire most about Jim and his plane and projects and lifestyle is that the man knows so much about living. He never sits still. There is always a project, something new to learn, another problem to figure out. He's almost always exhausted, dirty, covered in cuts and bruises, but these are the effects of living a full life. And yes, living that kind of life involves a certain amount of risk.From Arron, his death and now from Jim, I have learned so much about living life. Doing things that scare you, saying ""yes"" as much as possible, being exhausted in a good way. From Jim, I have learned that some risks are fun and have adventuresome outcomes and some are not worth taking. The trick is knowing the difference.Michelle writes,Phil's death taught me to be a better wife, because I only get one chance to be in this moment, to make amazing memories, to speak kind words, to love people well.Oh what a gift grief is! Learning what it means to be grateful! Us widowed types are probably nauseating to the general public as we run around hugging trees and throwing our arms open to the skies. I know I am a better girlfriend to Jim than I was a wife to Arron because I am just so damned grateful that Jim is in my life. It took so much sadness and grieving and learning how to live again, that so many things that seemed important when I was married no longer do. All the silly things like who's going to clear the dishwasher or who didn't put down the toilet seat or not being home on time for dinner just don't matter anymore. I am happy when Jim's nearby, but don't freak out when he's not. I know he's not far. I know he loves me. From the beginning of our relationship, Jim has assured me he isn't going anywhere and I'm holding him to it.The steel found its way safely to the bulkhead and by sunset was firmly planted into the ground providing the base of what will someday be a davit. It took a lot of effort and some risk to get there, but now that it's there, I know it isn't going anywhere."

Having died approximately 25 deaths -- something the actor said wasn't too bad since it's only a ""25 percent death rate"" -- TNT is promoting Bean's new show, ""Legends,"" with #DontKillSeanBean, because enough is enough.In his Reddit AMA on Tuesday, Aug. 5, Bean revealed that he has indeed watched his fan-made death reel and recently, while on HuffPost Live, he shared that his favorite death was that of Boromir in ""The Lord of the Rings"" (good choice). However, there is another death that particularly stands out for Bean. Asked over the phone about the most memorable shoot for a death scene, Bean immediately cited Ned Stark's beheading in ""Game of Thrones."" ""I guess it wasn't quite as physical as Boromir's death, but it was a ghastly moment, shocking -- just full of sheer betrayal,"" Bean told HuffPost TV. ""This one man who was the moral compass, who was a good man, and his demise was sorely a loss.""While Bean's many characters have met death by impalement with an anchor, being buried alive, freezing to death and being crushed by an antenna (just to name a few), Bean still says Ned's was the most mentally challenging one to shoot. ""Psychologically that was a very dramatic moment for me, when Prince Joffrey reneged on his earlier promises,"" he said. ""I think that's what made it particularly shocking and moving."" Although it's a sad moment, the former Lord of Winterfell went on to say how much he's flattered by his ""Game of Thrones"" fans who still mourn Ned's death. ""It's kind of a compliment, really."" ""Legends"" premieres Aug. 13 at 9 p.m. ET on TNT."

A suicide bombing killed 39 people at a market in Urumqi in May.(Reporting by Michael Martina; Editing by Clarence Fernandez)CORRECTION: The headline has been amended to correct that Chinese city Karamay issued the ban, not China's national government."

Milton Wolf confronts Pat Roberts on July 30Roberts appeared vulnerable earlier this year after questions were raised about his residency in Kansas, similar to what helped defeat veteran Sen. Richard Lugar (R-IN) two years ago. The New York Times reported in February that Roberts was renting space from a supporter in order to maintain his voter registration in Kansas, an address where neighbors hadn't seen him in years. He compounded his problems with a verbal slip last month, when he admitted in a radio interview that he returns to Kansas ""every time I have an opponent."" And Wolf was extreme enough to be a credible Tea Party standard bearer. While parlaying his family ties and far right wing views into frequent guest spots on Fox News and a column for the Washington Times, over the past few years Wolf repeatedly compared Obama and liberal Democrats to Hitler and the Nazis. He insisted ""(Sarah) Palin indeed was right...death panels are all too real,"" about supposed secret provisions in the Affordable Care Act.According to Wolf, the Act's requirement that people who choose not to buy health insurance be modestly fined (since by doing so, they risk burdening society with future emergency health care costs) was reminiscent of ""Stalin's iron-fisted gulags."" And he pledged to replace the ACA with his own ""PatientCare"" initiative, which would effectively destroy Medicaid by block-granting it to the states and changing it to a ""premium-support plan"" that would generously ""afford the needy the ability to purchase their own private insurance.""These nut-job ideas helped him attract the support of Tea Party groups including former S.C. Senator Jim DeMint's Senate Conservatives' Fund (now led by defeated Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli), who spent $580,000 backing Wolf; Fight for Tomorrow; the Madison Action Fund; and the Tea Party Patriots Citizens Fund, who paid for a last-minute ad falsely accusing Roberts of improperly ""taking a special exemption from ObamaCare.""But Roberts hit back hard and early, helped by his far superior campaign war chest. He refused to debate Wolf, which a week before the primary led to a memorable confrontation between the two when Wolf ambushed the Senator on the street prior to a campaign event.Roberts' ads attacked Wolf over revelations that he had posted gunshot victims' X-rays to Facebook in 2010, accompanied by snarky, joking comments that Wolf was eventually forced to admit were ""insensitive."" And highlighted other missteps like Wolf's failure to vote regularly in local or state elections.Except for an ad questioning Wolf's conservative credentials with an out-of-context clip of him saying he wanted to see Barack Obama succeed, Roberts refused to argue over policies, instead making the primary a referendum on Wolf's personal character. It was the same playbook that worked for other incumbent Senators who successfully fended off Tea Party challengers this cycle, like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), who beat back a well-funded campaign by businessman Matt Bevin. And Sen. Thad Cochran (R-MS), whose defeated opponent is still challenging Cochran's 7,667-vote runoff win on June 24 in their ugly primary fight.Wolf was a flawed candidate, but he held Roberts to under 50% of the vote. His failed primary challenge effectively made the case to many Kansas voters that Roberts has been in Washington for too long. Roberts first went to D.C. in the 1960's as a congressional aide, was elected to the House in 1980, and moved up to the Senate in 1996.Recent polls have shown a closer-than-expected race between Roberts and his Democratic opponent in the fall, Chad Taylor, the sitting District Attorney of Shawnee County, the county that includes Topeka, the capitol of Kansas. The telegenic, 40-year old Taylor was first elected in 2008, and re-elected in 2012 after facing no opposition. He won his own primary Tuesday night by a margin of 53-47%, beating a former U.S. Senate candidate with statewide name recognition. Taylor was endorsed by the Kansas City Star, who called his candidacy ""impressive,"" listed his priorities as ""growing jobs and the economy,"" and said he ""promises pragmatic, bipartisan work.""Taylor has won accolades for eliminating his office's backlog of over 4,000 cases that he inherited from his predecessor. He made national headlines in 2011, when to draw attention to budget cuts, his office stopped prosecuting domestic violence cases, calling on the city of Topeka to provide funding. In a surprise response that was widely criticized, Topeka actually repealed its ordinance outlawing domestic abuse, which led Taylor to announce that his office would resume prosecuting such cases. Last month, one SurveyUSA poll showed Taylor within five points of Roberts. This led Steve Kraske, political correspondent for the Kansas City Star, to declare that ""something...dramatic is going on in Kansas politics,"" and said it ""may be the closest a Democrat has been to a sitting Republican senator since Herbert Hoover bade farewell to the White House.""Roberts is facing other headwinds, too. Kansas is experiencing a Brownback backlash, after current Republican Governor Sam Brownback swung the state hard to the right once being elected in 2010. Brownback, a staunch religious conservative and longtime Koch brothers ally, formerly served beside Roberts in the U.S. Senate, and ran for President in 2008, dropping out before the primaries began. While in the Senate, Brownback co-sponsored the Constitution Restoration Act of 2005, which would have forbidden courts from ruling on matters involving church/state issues, and stated that judges who did hear such cases would be subject to impeachment and prosecution.As Governor, Brownback has pushed through drastic cuts to state education spending. He declared that life begins ""at fertizilation,"" and signed five anti-abortion bills, including a May, 2011 law that forbids insurance companies to offer health care coverage for abortions except to save a woman's life, with no exceptions for rape or incest.He also blew a hole in the state's budget by slashing the top income tax rates in Kansas. In response, last April the state's debt rating was downgraded by Moody's Investor Service.All year, polls have shown a tight race between Brownback and his current challenger, Kansas House Minority Leader Paul Davis. Unhappiness with Brownback's term has led nearly 100 Republican current and former officeholders from Kansas to endorse Davis. In his classic 2004 book What's The Matter With Kansas?, Thomas Frank explored the rise of anti-elitist conservatism, and how the radical right had managed to hijack populism in our country's heartland. It detailed how long before the Tea Party came to national prominence, the state's far-right conservatives were waging war with moderates for control of the Republican Party. Ten years later, extreme right-wing craziness and heartless social policies may have finally gone too far even for a bastion of red state America like Kansas.Erik Ose is a veteran of Democratic campaigns in North Carolina and blogs at The Latest Outrage."

(AP Photo/Harry Cabluck)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d22424000031005771ba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In support of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott’s efforts to reinstate the state’s ban on same-sex marriage, more than 60 Texas lawmakers signed an amicus brief Monday arguing that recognition of gay marriage could lead to the legalization of incest, pedophilia and polygamy. Filed with the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, 63 members of the Texas Conservative Coalition, the state legislature’s conservative caucus, advanced the notion that legalizing same-sex marriage could provide legal justification for the recognition of various moral taboos, including incest and pedophilia.“The district court broadened the definition of the ‘existing right to marry’ as one that includes the right of people to ‘select the partners of their choosing’ for marriage, without regard to sex,” the brief contends. “If the right to select ‘partners of their choosing’ is the criterion used to invoke marriage as a fundamental right, then marriage restrictions on age, polygamy, and consanguinity are also ripe for challenge.”As first reported by Lone Star Q, signatories include the GOP nominee for lieutenant governor, state Sen. Dan Patrick, Texas House Speaker Pro Tempore Dennis Bonnen (R) and state Sen. Ken Paxton, the Republican nominee for attorney general. To view the full list of the 63 lawmakers who signed the brief, see here.“Another ground cited by supporters of Texas’s marriage laws and subsequently dismissed by the district court is that recognition of same-sex marriage ‘could lead to the recognition of bigamy, incest, pedophilia, and group marriage,’” the brief continued. “As already discussed in this brief, restrictions on marriage relating to these moral considerations remain valid. Thus, the goal of actively trying to prevent those practices from becoming valid is entirely rational public policy.""While the Republican lawmakers concede that “recognition of pedophilia or other morally reprehensible actions” may not actually be the “logical next step” following marriage equality, they maintain that legislators enacted Texas’ marriage laws ""with the intention of supporting marriage arrangements that they believe support valid goals related to those concerns.”The friend-of-court brief comes one week after Abbott’s office filed an appellants brief urging the appeals court to reverse U.S. District Judge Orlando Garcia’s February decision, which deemed the state's same-sex marriage ban in violation of the 14th Amendment’s due-process and equal-protection clauses. ""Texas’ current marriage laws deny homosexual couples the right to marry, and in doing so, demean their dignity for no legitimate reason,"" Garcia wrote in the DeLeon v. Perry decision, which has been stayed pending Abbot’s appeal. In a 42-page appeal, Abbott argued that the state’s same-sex marriage ban promotes ""stable, lasting relationships"" for child-rearing and insisted that the issue be decided by voters and state lawmakers instead of the courts.“Texas’s marriage laws are rooted in a basic reality of human life: procreation requires a male and a female. Two people of the same sex cannot, by themselves, procreate,” Abbott's brief, which is also backed by the Texas Roman Catholic Bishops and the U.S. Catholic Conference of Bishops, states. “The State’s recognition and encouragement of opposite-sex marriages increases the likelihood that naturally procreative couples will produce children, and that they will do so in the context of stable, lasting relationships.”Echoing the state's reasoning, Monday’s brief from the Texas Conservative Coalition argued that defining marriage exclusively between one man and one woman “gives women and children the surest protection against poverty and abuse,” and “provides for healthy psychological development of children.”“There is a wide range of literature supporting this view, particularly with regard to child development, making it plausible and, thus, rational for legislators to believe,” the brief continues, citing widely debunked research from Mark Regnerus.While 19 states and the District of Columbia have legalized same-sex marriage, Midwest states are facing a litany of lawsuits from same-sex couples seeking marriage rights. Nationwide, more than 75 lawsuits challenging bans on same-sex unions are pending in 32 states. Since December, courts across the country have ruled in favor of marriage equality in 29 cases, all of which are now on appeal. (h/t Lone Star Q)"
