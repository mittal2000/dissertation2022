Writing on his Wordpress blog, Jon, also known as Reddit user ""pkcs11,"" recalls the day he learned his daughter Rya was born with half of a brain. ""After seeing the MRI, I knew that something was horribly wrong. Nearly the entire right hemisphere was missing,"" Jon wrote at the time. ""We are, in short, devastated. I go from being happy to have a beautiful baby girl and being rendered a sobbing jangle of nerves. Not sure where to go from here and we’re all feeling a little lost.""For the next two years, Jon would document the daily struggles, and triumphs, that come from living with a child with cerebral palsy. Through his blog and periodic updates on Reddit, Jon shared with the world Rya's adorable smile and her very first steps.And on Tuesday, on World Cerebral Palsy Day, Jon was proud to post a new milestone: Rya's first day of school. Jon's Reddit post garnered many positive comments, with one user calling the story ""absolutely beautiful,"" and another writing, ""I feel so incredibly proud and I don't even know these people, or that girl. This made my entire day.""According to United Cerebral Palsy, about 764,000 kids and adults in the U.S. have CP, and 8,000 babies and infants are diagnosed with it each year. Worldwide, 15,000,000 people have been diagnosed with the disorder.  While not curable, cerebral palsy is manageable through long-term care and rehabilitation efforts, according to the Mayo Clinic. In 2011, the Daily Mail documented the inspiring first steps of another child with CP, Finley Rosbotham, who like Rya, was diagnosed at 4 months after doctors discovered that a large part of the left side of his brain was missing.Finley slowly learned to crawl by chasing a Thomas The Tank train. The 2-year-old amazed medics, who credited ""extraordinary parenting"" for the boy's progress. Speaking with the outlet, Finley's mother, Kelly Rosbotham, told mothers to stay optimistic. ""If I could say to other mums in my position, never take for granted what the doctors say,"" Robotham said. ""Because anything can change and you will see the benefits of putting all your energy and efforts into it and when the doctors say 'no' you can still find a way. It shows what can be achieved."""
1,PARENTING,Parenting Rules For Those Who Don't Live In The White House,"Lisa Belkin, Contributor
Senior Columnist, The Huffington Post",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michelle-obama-parenting-rules_us_5b9c3e6ce4b03a1dcc7d4ffc,The reason my guys needed cellphones -- in case of emergency once they started wandering out in the world on their own -- is moot when the Secret Service is following you around all the time.,2012-09-06,"LOS ANGELES, CA - MARCH 31: (L-R) Sasha Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and Malia Obama at Nickelodeon's 25th Annual Kids' Choice Awards held at Galen Center on March 31, 2012 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c3e6c2000003000fd7e6a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Jodi Kantor, who seems to know almost as much about what goes on in the Obama household as the Obamas themselves, has written a summary in today's New York Times of the parenting rules in effect at the White House for 11-year-old Sasha and 14-year-old Malia. Kantor writes: Technology is for weekends. Malia can use her cellphone only then, and she and her sister cannot watch television or use a computer for anything but homework during the week.They also will be back at school Friday morning, hours after appearing with their father when he accepts renomination for President on Thursday night. Good rules, probably. And, I confess, though I have experimented with versions of each of these over the years, I never managed the consistency that aides say the Obamas have. Some, of course, would have made no sense -- my boys never went on the kind of trips the Obama girls do, so there would not have been much to write reports about. And others don't apply because I don't live in the White House. The reason my guys needed cellphones -- in case of emergency once they started wandering out in the world on their own -- is moot when the Secret Service is following you around all the time. There is also the interesting question of whether rules like these are all the more important for two girls who will be otherwise be getting the message from the world that the rules don't apply to them. But mostly I lacked backbone. I thought allowing my sons to try one activity after another, dropping them after a reasonable period of ""trying"", was a sign of flexibility, though even then I knew it was also a way to avoid arguments. And insisting that any food be finished, vegetables or otherwise, felt like forced feeding to me, though the result was that a lot of vegetables went uneaten. What rules do you successfully stick with at your house? Which ones have you abandoned? Do you have any regrets?Before you answer, I just want to say, that I would probably make it a rule that my children could skip school the morning after either of their parents accepted a presidential nomination. And also, both my sons DO know how to do their own laundry. More or less."

Prices for health care-related goods and services, higher education and food have all jumped over the last four years, according to the Consumer Price Index.(SCROLL DOWN FOR INFOGRAPHIC)Inflation isn't to blame -- in fact, inflation has been remarkably low since 2008 -- but stagnant wages, high unemployment and dropping net worth are making these costs sting more than ever for American households. ""Overall prices have been pretty modest but [consumer pressure has come from weak] wage growth,"" said Chris Christopher, director of U.S. & Global Consumer Economics for IHS, an information company.He noted that the price volatility of gasoline especially hurt consumers. ""The way people buy gas impacts consumer mood more than any other price other than food prices,"" he said.Four years ago this week, gas was only a smidge cheaper than it is today. But over the last four years it has fluctuated wildly, hitting a low of $1.68 per gallon in December 2008 and rising to nearly $4 in April 2012. It surged again this past Labor Day weekend. Even as some things like milk and vegetables are slightly less expensive when compared to 2008 prices, overall food costs have risen 8.5 percent in the last four years. The cost of meat has jumped significantly since Bush was in the White House: Both bacon and beef prices are up more than 20 percent compared to 2008, according to the Consumer Price Index. This week, food aid groups issued warnings that shortages could be on the horizon as food prices surge following this summer's drought, which has damaged corn and grain crops.But not everything is more expensive than it was four years ago: The natural gas boom has kept electricity bills down, while the eurozone crisis and China's weakening economy have also led to lower prices for consumer electronics, according to Christopher.Still, drowning one's economic sorrows with a glass of whiskey is more expensive today; whiskey prices are up more than 5 percent from 2008. We have growing affluence around the globe to thank for that. ""In places where the economy is doing well like Russia, they start drinking fancy stuff,"" Christopher said. ""There is only so much Scotch whiskey you can produce.""Check out how consumer prices have changed from 2008 to 2012:"

With New York Fashion Week kicking off today, every stylish guy and gal in the city seemed to be toasting, speechifying, air-kissing and posing for pictures at a slew of fashion fetes last night to inaugurate the big week ahead.Du Jour, the latest glossy magazine to hit newsstands, feted its debut issue with a party hosted by cover star Christy Turlington and photographer Bruce Weber. Held at Capitale, the party drew the likes of Russell Simmons, Amar'e Stoudemire, Hoda Kotb and model Hilary Rhoda. New York's revamped The Cut, which officially debuted August 13, also threw itself a launch party on the rooftop of the NoMad Hotel, attended by Nigel Barker, Coco Rocha, Lindsay Ellingson and Yigal Azrouel. Farther uptown, shoe designer Brian Atwood -- recently reprimanded for his overly sexy shoe ads -- threw a party celebrating the opening of his new Madison Avenue store, attended by pals Rachel Zoe, Michelle Trachtenberg, Heidi Klum, Ryan Lochte and Candice Swanepoel (star of the aforementioned ads). There were also ceremonies honoring some of fashion's greatest: the Fashion Institute of Technology presented Oscar de la Renta with the 2012 Couture Council Award for Artistry at a luncheon earlier in the day (Sarah Jessica Parker and Anna Wintour were by his side) and the 9th Annual Style Awards crowned Carolina Herrera the Designer Of The Year that evening at Lincoln Center (Katie Holmes did the honors). And that doesn't even include SPIN and Refinery29's party across the river in Brooklyn, the launch of the latest fashion tome, “Antonio Lopez: Fashion, Art, Sex and Disco” (Lopez was a friend of Karl Largerfeld) and the splashy red carpet premiere of ""Boardwalk Empire"" which drew the Hollywood crowd.It was hard to be in multiple places at once, but the most seasoned partygoers managed to hit several events each: Iman and Rachel Roy, for example, showed their faces at both the Style Awards and Brian Atwood's fete and Kim Kardashian wowed in a dramatic cutout dress at both the Brian Atwood store and Du Jour's launch.

With its legions of self-styled experts, YouTube has lowered the barrier",2012-09-06,"BEVERLY HILLS, CA - NOVEMBER 14: Michael Kors Collection hangs during the Michael Kors in-store appearance and fashion show at Nieman Marcus on November 14 in Beverly Hills, California. (Photo by Marsaili McGrath/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c3ceb1f000051002124bf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SmartMoney:For the chronically fashion-phobic, style consultants can seem like saviors. But prepare to tap into your savings. Here are the 10 things personal shoppers won't say.1. ""We're glorified clerks."" Years ago, Cherie Pines visited a personal shopper at Lord & Taylor in New York City. She needed help putting together polished outfits for her job in medical sales, yet she says the personal shopper suggested a series of bland outfits that screamed ""suburban teacher"" instead of ""Madison Avenue professional."" ""She didn't get it,"" Pines says. (Lord & Taylor did not respond to requests for comment.)Of course, ""getting it"" (or at least a piece of it) is what personal shoppers are all about: Households with incomes of $100,000 and above spend an average of $8,000 a year on clothing, according to market research firm Nielsen. There are even two types of professional who specialize in relieving fashion-challenged consumers of their annual shopping budgets: the in-store ""personal shopper"" and the independent ""style consultant.""RELATED: 10 Things Your Marriage Counselor Won't Tell YouBoth kinds of shopping professional aim to save clients time, by pulling clothes for their consideration prior to each scheduled appointment, for instance. Yet with less-skilled practitioners, the service doesn't go much beyond that, critics say -- either because the consultant doesn't have an eye for style, or because the customer really just wants a gofer. In one study earlier this year, America's Research Group found that customers at Macy's in particular seemed to use personal shoppers only to pull merchandise they'd already researched online. ""They're not using the personal shopper to make decisions,"" says ARG chairman Britt Beemer.""People use personal shoppers for a whole range of reasons,"" says Macy's spokesman Jim Sluzewski. Some customers may use one just to find specific merchandise, he says, but ""the personal shopper can curate options in the store for dressing for an event, or help a customer find the right fit.""RELATED: 10 Things Amazon Won't Tell You2. ""We'll shop 'til you drop your wallet."" Department stores typically do not charge shoppers for in-store personal-shopping services. Yet because most personal shoppers work on commission, ""You will definitely feel pressured to buy something,"" says Michelle Madhok, CEO of SheFinds.com, who worked as a personal shopper for Nordstrom early in her career.Nordstrom spokesman John Bailey says the service is designed to create a stress-free shopping environment: ""We never want our customers to feel pressured to buy something,"" he says.RELATED: 10 Things the Post Office Won't Tell YouThat said, the personal shopper has every incentive to persuade a client to buy -- and keep -- what she suggests: Merchandise bought through a personal shopper is tagged at check out, and the seller's commission typically gets cut if the item is returned.Independent image consultants, in contrast, can break the bank in their own way: They generally charge a flat or hourly fee for their services. A session with some independent consultants in New York City will set you back more than a visit to an accountant or a therapist. Style for Hire, a new network of personal stylists picked by Stacy London, one of the hosts of the TV show ""What Not to Wear"" charges from $40 an hour for a session with an apprentice stylist to more than $300 for the top consultants, says Cindy McLaughlin, CEO and co-founder. She says that despite this outlay, a good stylist ultimately saves clients money by making sure they put their existing wardrobes to good use and only buy necessary pieces: ""When they shop, they fill in the blanks,"" McLaughlin says.3. ""My only credential? A passion for fashion."" With its legions of self-styled experts, YouTube has lowered the barrier to entry for many professions -- including personal shopping. In fact, style consultants require very little overhead to hang up a shingle. While the Association of Image Consultants International and other professional organizations offer certification programs, there's no universally recognized credential for stylists. ""This is a bit of a Wild West industry,"" says Bridgette Raes, a style expert and president of Bridgette Raes Style Group in New York City. Raes studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology and says her formal training helped her understand cuts and fabrics that flatter every figure.Others dismiss the need for a fashion degree. Amy Salinger, who majored in communications in college, has built a successful business as an independent style consultant in New York City without any formal fashion education. A lifelong clothes horse, Salinger says she faced a steeper learning curve with the nuts and bolts of running her own firm: ""Forget about fashion, I wish I took a business course.""4. ""We've mastered the soft sell."" Since personal shoppers thrive off of referrals and repeat customers, it's in their best interest to keep customers happy while making sales. Each summer, Patty Edwards looks forward to the call from Nordstrom inviting her to an exclusive preview of the Seattle-based department store's annual Anniversary Sale. It's one of the perks that Edwards, chief investment officer at Trutina Financial in Bellevue, Wash., enjoys as a regular customer of Nordstrom's personal shopping services. The salespeople know what brands the busy executive favors, and they call her when new merchandise comes in, she says. Edwards doesn't find their sales tactics at all pushy: ""I've had more people at Nordstrom say, 'that doesn't work for you.'"" But they know her weaknesses and will often show her a purse that will complete an outfit. Most of the time, Edwards says, she's happy to succumb.5. ""Sometimes we play nice with one another, and sometimes we don't."" Salinger, the independent New York stylist, loves taking clients to the personal shoppers at Bergdorf Goodman, the high-end department store in New York City. She calls ahead of time and makes sure a dressing room is available; she then goes and pulls clothes for her clients, who are served Champagne or cappuccino as they sample the wares. ""They're quite lovely,"" Salinger says of the Bergdorf's personal shoppers, who get their cut of Salinger's clients' purchases, while she takes an hourly fee for her services.But not every relationship between in-store and independent shoppers is this cozy, experts say. Department stores maintain black lists of independent stylists who buy thousands of dollars' worth of merchandise for their clients to consider, only to return most of it later on, says Paco Underhill, the author of What Women Want: The Science of Female Shopping. ""Everybody is doing this, but they won't tell you about it,"" Underhill says.To continue reading click here."

Not because they are morbid or have a product to sell you to avoid death; rather, they are sincerely, vibrantly alive, in part because they have begun to include the inevitability of death into their overall approach to life.I heard Roshi Joan Halifax say that ""death is a mirror in which our whole orientation to life is reflected."" Is life existence? What is the meaning of life? What is meaningful in YOUR life? What is important to you? What are you doing about those elements of life that are important, that are meaningful?Yes, death is scary. Absolutely. So much so that its become almost taboo in our culture to bring the subject of death up. And there is often suffering related to death. But there is also suffering related to life. We get sick, we get hurt, we get fired, we get broken up with, we get left behind by children who go forth, etc. Suffering is a truth that we are all familiar with.But there is also a truth, the ""good news,"" which far fewer of us have experienced, which is that there is an end to suffering. Not an escape, but an end. And it doesn't come at death; it comes when we face our suffering, face our fears, and address them head on, with support, and move through them.So when was the last time ""death"" came up in a conversation you were having? We read about it in the news, especially on days of tragedy. We see an awful lot of it on TV and at the movies too, but when do you seriously (or not so seriously) talk about death with anyone? Often the answer is ""never,"" until death actually strikes down or is looming over someone very dear to you (which might include yourself). And in those moments of extreme emotion its very hard to speak and think rationally and comfortingly about anything.There is a small and growing counter-trend of people who are smiling and feasting in the face of this by attending ""Death and Dying Dinner Parties."" I am personally connected with one D&DDinner group based in Santa Monica, Calif. (You can find them on Facebook.)Once a month they hold a very elegant potluck dinner with fine china and volunteers to help serve and clean. Most who come together do not know each other at the start of the evening but are strongly bonded by the end. The event is hosted by a beautiful soul named Laurel, who brings an open heart, a patient ear, and the skills to facilitate a lively discussion.Everyone enjoys the food and the conversation, which can be quite wide-ranging -- sometimes somber but often humorous -- as long as it stays within the general field of death: your thoughts, questions and fears about it, your experience with it, the differences between animal/pet deaths and those of humans, art and philosophy that help us cope with it, perspectives on what lies beyond death, personal tales or questions about communicating with those who have died, how prepared you are for it financially, emotionally, physically, aspects of society that support or inhibit ""dying well,"" if that is even possible, and much much more.I strongly encourage you to check this particular group out or use Google and find something similar in your area. Maybe you have had some reaction to a death and want a safe and supportive environment to talk about it. Or maybe you get a sense that there is some wisdom in exploring this inevitability that brings up fear.Because death is scary, but moving through that fear is liberating. It brings deeper meaning into your life, leads you to prepare for your death in a way that will minimize suffering for those around you, and it helps you to focus on your priorities now so that you can live the time you have left from your deepest source into your highest potential.And you don't have to face it alone. There are friends and companions waiting to be made who want to explore this territory with you. All you have to do to start is to make a dinner date with them.See you around the table.peace,-- dbFor more by Doug Binzak, click here.For more on death and dying, click here. "

Yes, I know the show is a bit extreme, voyeuristic, and, well, often a little silly, but when my husband and I were staring into the marital abyss, I learned a valuable lesson from ""Divorce Court"" that helped me out at home. I learned this particular lesson from couples who couldn't figure out how they had gotten to ""Divorce Court"" in the first place. They had marriages that went awry in such small increments they didn't know what had happened. But before me they were forced to compress years' worth of trouble into a short presentation. Each telling me a different story the other was usually surprised to hear, they often found that they were coming apart not because one or both were wrong, but because of unexamined needs. Seeing that scenario play out before me over and over again helped me figure out what was going wrong in my own home. By year 19, my husband, Big E, and I were off the road and deep in the weeds. Barely speaking, when one of us walked in a room the other would walk out. He was angry and unhappy and he saw me as the source of both. I, on the other hand, saw him as a jerk, a man who cared nothing for my needs. Of course, as I eventually learned at work, we were both wrong. It was, instead, that unexamined need thing that had taken us off the road.Having become a father at 19, my husband married his first wife and had four children by the time he was 26. As a result, he never got to do as he pleased because he did so much for others. When he looked at me he saw new and unencumbered. He saw me as the first installment in a lot of choices he was owed. I, on the other hand, was raised in a house that rocked and rolled on the rhythm of whatever was wrong with Dad. Daddy was a brilliant, principled man who loved his family. He was also bipolar. Stuff was jumping off at my house all of the time and you never knew when or why. When I looked at Big E, I saw stable, safe, and secure. Once we married, however, every time E didn't get his way it was another drop in a bucket of sacrifices that was already full. By being willing to give me the children I sought -- which, when you think about it, is huge -- he took everything else off the table. Any desire I had that didn't match his got me a little static. That would all have been well and good had I responded correctly. Though E was just ordinary, everyday annoyed about things, I didn't see it that way. Even the mildest objection he raised prompted that voice in the back of my head to say, ""Shut it down; it could go bad."" So instead of engaging in any meaningful exchange, I capitulated, repeatedly. If you keep surrendering like that, eventually the other person buys. Over time I taught my husband that by merely furrowing his brow he could get me to back off my position. I was saying ""I'm sorry"" for even wanting to do something he didn't like. And once you start that nonsense, the person whose pardon you are continuously begging begins to believe that you are, in fact, a perpetual problem. By the time we were 19 years into our marriage he was all day, every day angry and I had lost all confidence in my home. I had paid for the peace I sought with my sense of self. And he was getting to pick the restaurant at the cost of liking his wife. Of course, the hardest thing in the world for anyone to see is oneself. I didn't know all this was what we were doing until I stepped back from where we were and looked at it as if I were on the bench. That's when I saw all of the small stupid things that landed us where we were. Since this is real life, my ""aha moment"" on the job didn't instantly lead to new and better. In fact, I went home and started an argument that lasted for 18 months. But once I got past the anger I started to address my own fears and learned how to communicate effectively. He followed suit because he saw that I had changed in a way that was in his best interests. It didn't feel like it at first, but eventually he got there. We then decided to fight the problem instead of fighting one another. Of course, this does not guarantee we'll get to happily ever after. Marriage is quite the journey and things change all the time. But our marriage is better now because it is a mindful one. We keep an eye on our competing needs. We no longer act on that right-now feeling without considering long-term consequences. We have made a conscious decision to be consciously married. We also have our fingers crossed.Below, a photo of the couple.

Its booming cultural, higher education, technology and medicine-related sectors attract families, empty nesters and college grads alike to our many neighborhoods. Yet -- like many American cities -- a significant subset of our population remains in poverty, lacking the skills needed to fill many of the jobs the city has to offer. As mayor, it's my job to figure out how to both address our city's challenges and boost our assets and, whenever possible, find solutions that meet those two needs at the same time.  The city's hospitality industry offers Philadelphia that solution. Hospitality brings visitors to our city -- whether they are families looking to spend the weekend, business travelers in town for a meeting or major convention, international visitors exploring America's birthplace or art lovers, music fans and foodies in town for a night. In 2011, 38 million people traveled to the Philadelphia region, 10 million more than a decade ago, generating $26 million in economic impact every day. These visitors need places to stay, restaurants to eat in, folks to show them around the city. And so while tourism attracts new people to our city, it is a major source of jobs for the Philadelphians who live here. Construction jobs each time a new hotel or museum is built; executives, managers, customer service staff and maintenance employees operating each new hotel; skilled tradesmen and women setting up and taking down every convention stage and showroom; concierges, tour guides and marketing professionals hired as new attractions come online; chefs, servers and bartenders hired when restaurants open their doors to new customers.Some 56,000 Philadelphians are employed in the hospitality industry, and so a major priority of our city is to keep that machine running smoothly.As Mayor, I'm fortunate to have the Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corporation, Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau, Pennsylvania Convention Center Authority, Independence Visitor Center, Greater Philadelphia Hotel Association and our region's Chamber of Commerce at my side. Together, we've made clear progress despite the economic downturn as we continue to effectively market and promote Philadelphia. In the last two years, we doubled the size of our Convention Center; celebrated the Barnes Foundation's move to Philadelphia's Ben Franklin Parkway, putting the world's greatest individual art collection on display on the world's greatest cultural corridor; built the President's House commemorative site, standing as a marker of our country's first White House and an important reminder of our nation's complex racial history; and just next door, we welcomed the new National Museum of American Jewish History to the nation's most historic square mile.We have opened five new hotels in the last four years, with two more set to open this fall. These investments are working. A recent report by the U.S. Travel Association shows that overnight visitation to Greater Philadelphia has grown six times faster than the national average since 1997.These are not just new places to visit and stay. They're also new construction jobs and permanent hospitality jobs for city residents. However, as we create more and more opportunities for Philadelphians to work in the hospitality industry, we must also make sure that they have the tools and skills to succeed in these new jobs. Workforce development organizations have already developed innovative ways to establish training pipelines into the hospitality industry. Our Community College of Philadelphia runs a hospitality certification program as a pipeline into the industry or toward a four-year degree. Another building block is a unique program called Philly Welcomes U, an online training and certification course developed by our Convention and Visitors Bureau specifically designed to develop the skills of those looking for entry into hospitality and customer service jobs. Cities like Philadelphia are places where people are choosing to live, work and visit. There's a buzz in Philadelphia that is palpable. But, as Mayor, I know that cities are not immune to the current challenges of too high unemployment, too low educational attainment and a mismatch between skills and jobs. Our hospitality sector focuses on making sure visitors have a great time in our city -- but behind the scenes, it is employing thousands of city residents.With the right focus on supporting our hospitality industry and building our workforce pipeline, our goal is to ensure not only that visitors enjoy themselves when they come to town, but that Philadelphia's tale of two cities becomes the story of our enduring success.This post is part of the HuffPost Shadow Conventions 2012, a series spotlighting three issues that are not being discussed at the national GOP and Democratic conventions: The Drug War, Poverty in America and Money in Politics.
