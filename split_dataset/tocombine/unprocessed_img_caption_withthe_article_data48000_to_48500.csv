0,POLITICS,Voters Don’t Trust Donald Trump On Any Of These Major Issues,Samantha Neal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/voters-dont-trust-trump_us_57bb5784e4b00d9c3a19451f,He’s the most distrusted Republican candidate in recent history when it comes to policy.,2016-08-23,Trump's devastating poll results on these important voting issues are unprecedented in the 21st century.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bb5c32180000ad02bcc5d8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"More voters trust Hillary Clinton than Donald Trump on nearly every key issue ― a feat not achieved by any candidate in recent elections, according to polling data aggregated by The Huffington Post.Trump trails Clinton in voter trust on each of the issues that typically rank highest in people’s minds when evaluating a presidential candidate ― the economy, immigration, terrorism, national security, foreign policy, social issues and criminal justice, according to a HuffPost aggregation of polling data. Clinton even leads on the topics that Republicans have historically been perceived as better-equipped to handle.HuffPost looked at “trust” questions from all publicly available polls between July and August that met the criteria for HuffPost Pollster. The numbers reported are the averages of these polls. Trump’s deficiencies are unprecedented in the 21st century, according to polling data collected by the same method over the course of the past four general elections.During the 2008 contest between then-Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain, the last election cycle this century in which an incumbent was not a contender in the race (thereby eliminating incumbency advantage), McCain earned the majority of voters’ trust on half of major voting issues.The last Republican president, George W. Bush, won three of these six issues when he first ran for president in 2000. When he successfully ran again as an incumbent in 2004, he won three of the five voting issues.This portends anything but good news for Trump. He not only fails to amass a majority of voters’ trust on issues that previous Republican candidates have won, but also performs poorly on issues that his campaign has made central to its message.Improving national security and tackling terrorism are central tenets of Trump’s campaign, and are issues that both Bush and McCain won by decisive margins during their electoral bids. In this election, however, Clinton leads Trump on the issue by an average of 2.1 percentage points.A Democratic lead on terrorism and national security issues is not entirely unprecedented, however. In 2012, presidential incumbent Obama trounced GOP nominee Mitt Romney in this realm, toppling Romney by an average of 10.1 percentage points.Trust on the economy is a mixed bag: Democrats clinched a narrow victory in 2004, and a slightly larger one in 2008. Republicans pulled ahead in 2000 and 2012; the latter of which was an election year in which the GOP nominee was Romney, a candidate whose reputation was in large part predicated on his success in business.Trump has also campaigned on his reputation as a businessman, but that strategy doesn’t seem to be working as well as it did for Romney. Clinton leads narrowly on the issue by 0.6 percent on average.There’s varied data on international relations and foreign policy trust over the years ― Democrats had a slight edge in 2000 and a greater one in 2012; Republicans pulled ahead in 2004 and 2008. In 2016, however, we see the most decisive victory for any presidential candidate on the issue in recent history: Clinton leads Trump by a formidable 16.7 percentage points. This significant lead is presumably attributable in part to Clinton’s four years conducting foreign policy as secretary of state. Pollsters only sampled voters’ trust on immigration in the 2008 and 2012 election cycles. Obama generated more confidence in 2012 against former Gov. Romney, while in 2008 McCain topped Obama on the issue. Despite Trump’s hardline immigration policy, the chief component of which is to build a wall separating the United States and Mexico, trust in Clinton far surpasses trust in Trump by a margin of 13.5 percent.The Democratic lean on every major voting issue poses a clearer problem for Trump when contextualized by his performance on some of these polling questions in the past. In April, Trump was leading Clinton on the economy question by a 5-point margin, according to a CNN/ORC poll. The same poll now shows Clinton leading on this issue by 2 percentage points in July, the poll’s most recent release.These results are also devastating for Trump given that his relatively extreme stances on immigration, terrorism and national security are crucial benchmarks of his primary campaign ― stances that catalyzed a sentiment propelling him past his fellow GOP primary contenders.The general election, however, is a new animal entirely ― one that is looking increasingly impossible for Trump to wrangle to his advantage.Polling results included all nationwide polls that would be included in our HuffPost Pollster charts conducted between July through September over the past four election cycles. The data from all polling sources was averaged per voting issue. Approved pollsters included in the aggregation include Pew Research Center, ABC News/Washington Post, Bloomberg, McClatchy/Marist, NBC/WSJ, CNN/ORC, CBS/NYT, Newsweek, FOX, USA Today/Gallup, AP-GfK Roper Public Affairs, LA Times/Bloomberg, Time and Quinnipiac."

Independents are split about evenly between the two candidates. During the primary election, Democratic voters generally perceived Clinton as having won her debates, while GOP primary voters had more mixed views of Trump’s performances.Americans are divided on how much company they want Clinton and Trump to have onstage. According to debate rules announced last week, candidates will only be included if they’re polling above 15 percent in an average of five national surveys ― a criterion that seems likely to exclude Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson, who’s currently averaging closer to 8 percent, and Green Party nominee Jill Stein, whose numbers are even lower.Twenty-one percent of Americans agree with the current ground rules, saying they’d like to see third-party candidates who meet the polling threshold included, while 31 percent want to see third-party candidates included regardless of how well they’re doing in the polls.Another 33 percent only want Clinton and Trump to be included.A plurality of both Democrats and Republicans ― 40 percent and 47 percent, respectively ― want to see a showdown between just Clinton and Trump. But 42 percent of independents and members of third parties say that all candidates should be invited, regardless of their poll numbers.Fifty-nine percent of Americans say they’re at least somewhat looking forward to this year’s debates, with 31 percent saying they’re looking forward to them a lot. Twenty-six percent say they’re not looking forward to them very much, and 15 percent say that they’re not anticipating them at all.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Aug. 17-18 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov’s opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

He’s the type who whips out his phone at a glitzy movie premiere to show off photos of his new baby daughter. On Tuesday, the actor overwhelmed cast members Charlie Day and Mary Elizabeth Winstead with a first look at the newest addition to the Blunt/Krasinski brood at the Los Angeles premiere of his second directorial effort, “The Hollars,” which he also produced and stars in, The Daily Mail reports. Krasinski and wife Emily Blunt, who are already parents to 2-year-old Hazel, recently welcomed their second child, Violet, in June. The couple has yet to release a photo of Violet to the public, so we’ll just have to trust Krasinski’s co-stars’ reactions (and that gene pool) and guess that she is just adorable. According to “The Office” actor, baby Violet is equally popular on the home front. In a recent interview with Entertainment Tonight, Krasinski opened up about his new family dynamics and explained how his eldest daughter has embraced her new sister.  “She really loves the baby, and I think there is this idea of, ‘Oh my God, she is adorable,’” he said. “I mean when a 2-and-a-half-year-old hugs a newborn baby it’s one of the cutest things you will ever see.”Um, that is cute, but we’re almost positive the photo above is cuter.

3,POLITICS,Aide Explains How Donald Trump Will Carry Out His Deportation Plans,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-deportation-plan_us_57bc714ce4b03d51368adba4,Unless he changes his mind.,2016-08-23,"Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has said undocumented immigrants ""have to go,"" but not as much about how he would make that happen.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bcccd31700001108c75022.jpeg?cache=OllVFi3yhM&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For all that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has talked about immigration, the specifics of his deportation policies can be difficult to parse. The biggest question: Trump has said he wants to “round up” and deport all undocumented immigrants, but how, exactly, would he do it, if at all? Trump will lay out more details of his immigration policies soon, according to campaign officials. But in response to The Huffington Post’s questions, a campaign aide offered one of the most detailed explanations to date about what a Trump administration immigration enforcement regime might look like.The aide argued that Trump has never actually advocated for the type of large-scale raids that come to mind when people hear the words “mass deportation” or remarks about “rounding up” undocumented immigrants. “He’s said many times that he’s not talking about mass deportation,” said the aide, who asked not to be identified to speak about the issue in depth. “What he’s talking about is enforcing the law of the land. If you come into contact with a federal immigration officer in the course of the lawful exercise of their duties, that immigration officer is legally and duty-bound to carry out a legal proceeding and issue a notice to appear.“It’s never been the case that to effectuate a sound, lawful immigration system that you would need to rely exclusively on immigration raids, or whatever it may be,” the aide said. Trump’s first priority, the aide said, would instead be deporting criminals, gang members and security threats. Trump has often referenced them as “the bad ones.” On Monday, he promised to deport this group “so fast your head will spin.” As for the rest, Trump has said, “we’re going to go through the process like they are now, perhaps with a lot more energy, and we’re going to do it only through the system of laws.”A position that emphasizes deporting the bad apples of the undocumented population while figuring out a way to sift through those remaining, is both broad and, generally speaking, what the Obama administration already does. The administration says it focuses removal efforts on criminals, recent border-crossers and national security threats. So are Trump and Obama now in the same place? Not quite. The differences are visible in what priorities are applied to the sifting and the level of resources brought to bear. Trump seems to acknowledge the need for prioritization by saying he would focus swift deportation efforts on a specific subset of undocumented immigrants. As for resources, his campaign aide said he would push for more immigration judges and enforcement agents, but it’s unlikely that Congress would fund the number needed for immediate deportation of all undocumented immigrants. Where Obama and Trump also differ is that Trump would eliminate the Obama policies that create what the campaign aide said is an “immunity blanket for ... 99 percent of the illegal immigrant population.” That includes the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, that allows undocumented young people who came to the U.S. to stay on a temporary basis, but also lesser-known policy memos that discourage officers from pursuing deportation against some individuals who they encounter and deem low priority. Trump’s aide indicated that he would have a broader definition of high priority than either Obama or Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, noting that some people who have been released because they committed low-priority offenses have gone on to commit serious crimes. The idea would be to allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and border patrol agents to do their jobs “free from political interference and bureaucratic interference,” the aide said. Undocumented immigrants would be detained during deportation proceedings if they were considered dangerous, a flight risk, or had been recently apprehended at the border, the aide said. This is not all that different from current policy, although Trump has proposed tougher treatment of the women and children apprehended at the southern border, most of them claiming fear of deportation to their native countries. He has said they would face mandatory detention and expedited deportation. The undocumented immigrants who do not fit that category would not be detained, Trump said on Monday. “You don’t have to put them in a detention center,” he told Fox News host Bill O’Reilly when asked if he would take people from their homes and put them in facilities. Comments like these have led to accusations that Trump is softening the hard-line stance that won him the Republican primary. For example, Trump had proposed “rounding ‘em up” ― which certainly suggests some form of holding center prior to deportation proceedings ― and even tweeted what seemed to be approval of the concept of mass deportations (just not the phrasing).Trump’s campaign aide said that O’Reilly’s question about putting all undocumented immigrants in detention centers was a hypothetical based on something Trump has never proposed. The aide argued that whether Trump’s policies amount to “mass deportation” or “rounding up” undocumented immigrants is a matter of opinion. “You and others, and people in the advocacy community, may use the term ‘round up’ or ‘mass deportation’ to describe removing any large number of people under any circumstance,” the aide said. In the end, this has always been the difficulty with interpreting Trump’s immigration comments ― they sound different to different people because they’re vague. Anti-amnesty supporters applauded him for saying undocumented immigrants “have to go,” but Trump has also carved out wiggle room by suggesting he won’t deport everyone immediately. He did as much on Tuesday, telling Fox News’ Sean Hannity that “there certainly can be a softening” in his position while, moments later, stressing, “We are going to follow the laws of this country.”And, of course, everything could change the next time Trump speaks on the topic. He has a penchant for improvising policy. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

She alleges the company neglected to pay her insurance premium before terminating its relationship with the star, TMZ reported on Tuesday. According to documents obtained by the celebrity news site, both sides settled the lawsuit late last week. The amount Doherty received is undisclosed. TMZ states that, before the settlement, the ex-manager’s lawyers attempted to bring Doherty in for a second deposition to question the severity of her illness.The Huffington Post has reached out to Doherty’s legal representation for more information and will update this post accordingly. The actress initially sued the company, Tanner Mainstain Glynn & Johnson, last year because she said it was their responsibility “to ensure timely payment of the medical insurance premiums she had through the Screen Actors Guild,” according to The Hollywood Reporter. The official complaint obtained by TMZ stated: “In November 2013, SAG sent the premium invoice to Tanner Mainstain for Plaintiff’s medical insurance coverage for the year 2014. However, Defendants ignored it, failed to pay it (without informing Plaintiff) and then promptly terminated their relationship with [Doherty] effective February 7, 2014.”Doherty became uninsured as soon as she was dropped from the management firm, though she was unaware of that fact. In her complaint, she claimed that, had she been insured and able to visit her doctor, her breast cancer could have been detected earlier or possibly avoided altogether. Instead, she reportedly had to wait until 2015 to re-enroll with SAG insurance, which is when she received her diagnosis. Since then, Doherty has been very open about her battle with cancer, sharing touching posts on social media and even documenting the process of shaving her head. Earlier in August, she revealed that her cancer has spread during an interview with Entertainment Tonight. "
6,POLITICS,Why The Clinton Campaign Isn't Attacking Trump As A Flip-Flopper,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-flip-flopper_us_57bc4127e4b0b51733a5a32f,Is he too all over the place for the charge to stick?,2016-08-23,Hillary Clinton has chosen to attack Trump for reasons other than being a flip-flopper.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There is nothing steady about Donald Trump’s policy platform. To the extent that he takes positions on critical issues, the Republican nominee is prone to revising and obfuscating them. Most recently, he reportedly had softened his stance on what to do about the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in America. Suddenly, it seemed, he was open to figuring out some kind of legal status for these people after having spent the campaign talking about a deportation force.A few nights later, Trump insisted that nothing had changed. But the businessman has been inconsistent in so many areas that it’s hard to know, not just what he believes now, but what he’s ever believed. He’s called for both raising and lowering the minimum wage. He’s talked about valuing women’s health decisions while also saying he’d punish women seeking abortions. He’s repeatedly claimed that he was against the invasions of Iraq and Libya, even though he said at the time that he supported both. He blamed the pullout of troops from Iraq for causing the spread of ISIS, without mentioning that he supported that drawdown. He’s called for tax hikes for the wealthy and promoted a tax plan that would do the opposite. He’s claimed he wouldn’t mind if Japan got nuclear weapons and then denied he said any such thing. He’s spoken favorably of H-1B visas and criticized them as well. He’s continued to say he’s self-funding even as he’s brought in millions of dollars from donors. He’s claimed not to know David Duke despite being on video disavowing the KKK official years prior. He’s even said he’s both thin-skinned and thick-skinned, temperamentally speaking.A list like this would seem to provide a tidy political opportunity for Hillary Clinton’s campaign. But by and large, the former secretary of state and her staff have refrained from going after Trump for his routine inconsistencies. Responding to the latest immigration policy news, for instance, her campaign chairman John Podesta treated the apparent shift as if it hadn’t happened at all. “We believe the RNC official in the room, the campaign’s statement after the meeting and the candidate himself that Donald Trump’s immigration plan remains the same as it’s always been: tear apart families and deport 16 million people from the United States,” Podesta’s statement read. The decision to largely avoid going after Trump as a serial flip-flopper is one that top officials at Clinton’s campaign say was made without hesitation. Though there is recent history to suggest it could work (the man who succeeded Clinton at Foggy Bottom, John Kerry, can attest to that), they concluded that the charge was too complicated to land effectively.Part of the reason is the erratic nature of Trump’s policy pronouncements. As one top Clinton aide explained to The Huffington Post, it’s difficult to attack the GOP nominee for flip-flopping if, ultimately, he ends up at the very same position where he started.“He’s actively pushing back that he changed this morning,” the aide noted of the latest immigration policy reversal.But the main reason the Clinton camp has kept the “flip-flopper” charge on the shelf is because their research shows that voters respond better to the idea that Trump’s motives are subconscious, rather than political. It was, the aide said, the difference between being opportunistic and being “unstable” ― a word used by other Clinton officials in recent interviews to describe the GOP nominee.“The effectiveness is showing people who he is,” explained Joel Benenson, Clinton’s chief strategist. “When you make bigoted and racist comments, attack war heroes, it shows your lack of character to the American people. And our job is to not let voters forget who this man is and how he has vilified so many different groups of people through this campaign. It is part of what makes him unfit and it is what are explaining in very simple terms.” The result has been a campaign strategy that has, somewhat remarkably, largely bypassed Trump’s ideological vacillations, even as the topic fascinates much of the press corps. To date, the ads run by the Clinton team and allied groups have spent little time spotlighting Trump’s inconsistencies, instead focusing almost entirely on his more outlandish moments. “Regardless of what side of an issue Trump stumbles on at any given time, the fundamental argument against him remains the same,” said Guy Cecil, head of the Clinton-backing super PAC Priorities USA, in an email. “He does not have the judgement, character, or temperament to be President. He is a danger to our national security and our economy. It’s much more important to be focused on that core argument, than getting sidetracked by other things.”Of course, it might be that Clinton is reluctant to attack Trump as a flip-flopper because she fears it could boomerang back on her. Whereas George W. Bush was able to attack Kerry as a waffler because he’d made his own unshakeable convictions a selling point of his candidacy, Clinton would likely have difficulty pulling that off.“I think she carries her own trust issues that it wouldn’t be helpful to argue that on,” said Matthew Dowd, a senior adviser to Bush’s 2004 campaign. “Best to argue your strength vs. their weakness. Trust is weak territory for her.” But it’s also possible that voters simply don’t care much anymore if a candidate hops between one side and the other on major policy matters. In 2012, the Obama re-election campaign faced a similar target in Mitt Romney, who had drifted rightward as he moved from governor of liberal-leaning Massachusetts to a conservative firebrand. They, too, largely bypassed on using the flip-flopper label.“Our concern was that if you called him a flip-flopper, it implied that the moderate views he displayed as a governor were a truer reflection of how he would govern,” explained David Axelrod, longtime aide to President Barack Obama.As Axelrod sees it, it’s wise for Clinton’s team to make the same play, if only because labeling Trump a flip-flopper would provide “swing voters a permission structure to conclude he won’t really do the disturbing things he’s vowed to do over the past year.” Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

(For the record, he is not attached to the upcoming film and did not confirm the actress’ casting.) In a Facebook post on Friday, Gunn spoke out against the racists that responded to his tweet and asked for the “thoughtful majority” out there to give Zendaya’s casting a chance. “For me, if a character’s primary attribute — the thing that makes them iconic — is the color of their skin, or their hair color, frankly, that character is shallow and sucks,” Gunn said. “For me, what makes MJ MJ is her alpha female playfulness, and if the actress captures that, then she’ll work. And, for the record, I think Zendaya even matches what I think of as MJ’s primary physical characteristics — she’s a tall, thin model — much more so than actresses have in the past.” Well, that last sentence isn’t perfect, but it’s clear that he’s trying. Gunn continued his post by urging his followers to realize we live in a “diverse present world” nowadays, no matter what all-white comic book stories might suggest. “Perhaps we can be open to the idea that, although someone may not initially match how we personally conceive a character, we can be — and often are — happily surprised.” Read the rest of Gunn’s post below:And for all you haters still out there, this is for you: "

Clinton garners 43 percent support to Trump’s 44 percent among likely Missouri voters in a Monmouth University poll that has a margin of error of 4.9 percent. While the survey is strikingly bad news for Trump ― Missouri went for the Republican in each of the past four presidential contests ― it’s just one survey. Others show Trump ahead, and HuffPost Pollster tracking shows the conspiracy theorist-in-chief maintaining his advantage in the state.Still, since midsummer Trump’s terrible poll numbers have made the presidential contest competitive in several states Republicans usually win. In the Monmouth poll, Clinton leads Trump among black, Hispanic and Asian voters, 78 percent to 13 percent. Trump gets support from 50 percent of white voters, compared to Clinton’s 37 percent. Fifty-three percent of all Missouri voters say Clinton would be better for race relations, compared to 34 percent who preferred Trump. Civil unrest in the wake of the 2014 police killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, helped spark the Black Lives Matter movement, which Trump has condemned. Republican nominee Mitt Romney comfortably defeated President Barack Obama in Missouri in 2012, but John McCain barely defeated Obama there in 2008. “The race was a squeaker the last time there was a vacancy in the Oval Office,” Monmouth polling director Patrick Murray said in a press release. “In that respect, this year looks more like 2008 than 2012 when Romney won the state by ten points.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Volunteers for nonprofit Happy Period hand out feminine hygiene products to homeless women in shelters and on the street. About once a month, people gather at the nonprofit’s nine chapters in the U.S. and Canada to collect donated menstrual products. They assemble them into individual kits, and then give them to local shelters or to women living on the streets.Each kit has four tampons, five pads, two wipes, five pantyliners, one soap and one pair of underwear. Homeless women often can’t afford menstrual hygiene products and shelters rarely get donations of pads and tampons even though they’re in high demand. “A lot of us don’t think about the fact that homeless people get their periods,” founder Chelsea VonChaz told The Huffington Post. “We all have periods ― but for some reason we don’t think about it in terms of those less fortunate. This is a real issue of women’s rights.”VonChaz recognized the problem last year, when she was driving to work in Los Angeles and noticed a woman, who appeared to be homeless, with blood-stained bottoms. She called a local shelter to ask if it provided menstrual products to residents. The staff member said the shelter offered them, but only when available.“They said they were more likely to get donations of food, clothes, money ― even toothbrushes or razor blades ― than pads and tampons,” VonChaz said. That’s how the seed was planted.” She started gathering friends on weekends to hand out menstrual products to homeless women on L.A.’s Skid Row, an area known for its overwhelming homeless population. By June 2015, she registered Happy Period as a nonprofit, and expanded the project to nine cities across the U.S. and Canada.From Miami and Atlanta, to Toronto and New York, around 15 to 60 volunteers gather anywhere from once a month to once every three months. Since the project launched last year, the organization has donated an estimated 6,000 kits to homeless women. For VonChaz, giving out menstrual products in the streets is key to reaching homeless women who may choose not to stay in shelters, as well as transgender individuals who can sometimes have a hard time finding shelter matching their gender identity.“I’ve heard stories of transgender men not being allowed in women’s shelters ― so they don’t have access to the places that might give menstrual products out,” VonChaz said. “If you are a trans man and you still have your period, it’s a struggle.”VonChaz’s goal is to keep growing the Happy Period volunteer network, and eventually become a “middle woman” between menstrual product companies and those in need of their items.“I could do this forever,” VonChaz said. “I want this to be a movement.”Visit DoSomething.org to find out how you can make a difference."

Last year, two South Korean soldiers were wounded by what the South said were mines laid by the North. The North expressed regret for the incident, without directly admitting to planting them.South Korea’s defense ministry declined to comment on the Yonhap report of new mines saying the area was under the control of the U.N. Command.The U.N. Command, headed by the U.S. military, which jointly supervises security in Panmunjom with the North, expressed concern about activities by the North’s military but did not confirm the report about mines.“The presence of any device or munition on or near the bridge seriously jeopardizes the safety” of people near the border, the U.N. Command said in a statement.It declined to speculate on the reason for recent unspecified activity by the North’s military.Yonhap cited the government source as saying the mines may have been laid to prevent North Korean soldiers from defecting to the South.On Monday, the North’s military said it was prepared to launch a retaliatory strike against the South and the United States in response to the annual drills called Ulchi Freedom Guardian, in which about 25,000 U.S. troops are participating.Tension has been inflamed in recent days by the defection of a senior North Korean diplomat to the South in an embarrassing blow to the North.(Reporting by Jack Kim; Editing by Robert Birsel)"

All you need is the perfect miniseries to immerse yourself in, something with topical themes, gripping narratives, and top-of-the-line acting.Fortunately, the streaming service Hulu will have just the thing: A spanking-new, 10-episode adaptation of Margaret Atwood’s seminal dystopian novel The Handmaid’s Tale. Today, Hulu announced that the upcoming show will feature Joseph Fiennes (you may remember him as freaking William Shakespeare) as Commander Fred Waterford. Fiennes will be a baddy foil to the luminous Elisabeth Moss (Peggy from “Mad Men”), who, it was reported in April, will portray the novel’s heroine, Offred. Samira Wiley, known for her role as Poussey on “Orange Is the New Black,” has signed on to play Moira, Offred’s friend and fellow handmaiden.For those who somehow skipped Atwood’s feminist classic in high school English class, as well as in any college survey courses covering contemporary fiction, dystopian fiction, science fiction, feminist literature and/or novels by women, here’s a little rundown of what to expect:The Handmaid’s Tale takes place in a future society set in North America. A theocratic Christian group has staged a takeover and formed a dictatorship, called the Republic of Gilead, where the United States once existed. The government systematically and gradually strips away the rights of women, ultimately seeking to return the society to an Old-Testament-based social order in which women are entirely subjugated to men. Some women serve as domestic drudges, others as prostitutes, and others as wives ― the highest status available, but still a very limiting one.Offred, the protagonist, is separated from her husband and placed with a high-ranking member of the Gilead leadership, the Commander, as a handmaid. This class of women are offered to men whose wives are unable to bear them children; while the Commander’s wife is still very much present in the household, Offred is forced to act as a sexual and reproductive surrogate for her so that the Commander can produce heirs. But Offred’s spunk and her memory of the joy found in a freely chosen, loving partnership urge her to keep resisting, and to keep seeking true connection and freedom.No spoilers here, but the book is a wild ride, and the series promises to be as well.We can’t wait to see how “The Handmaid’s Tale” adaptation turns out, especially since Atwood herself is a consulting producer. Plus, who wants to see these two butt heads? We do.Something tells us Peggy Offred isn’t going down without a fight. "

The creditor told Antonio Weiss, who would become the point person on the island’s fiscal crisis, that the Puerto Rico government should simply eliminate some waste and cut a certain number of jobs to pay back its debt. Don’t bet on Congress helping, the creditor said. A year ago, the idea of lawmakers lifting a finger to help the beleaguered commonwealth was indeed a pipe dream. But Weiss knew better. He told the creditor that history indicated otherwise. When Americans’ livelihoods are threatened, he said, Congress moves in. Puerto Rico is home to 3.5 million Americans.Earlier this summer, after a year of haggling and revising, Congress passed legislation allowing the commonwealth to restructure its $70 billion in debt under the supervision of an oversight board. The bill didn’t satisfy everyone, but it is nevertheless the only piece of major economic policy to pass Congress this year ― a sign of Treasury’s persistence in the face of incredible gridlock.At the center of those negotiations, and in countless meetings with lawmakers, labor unions, Puerto Rican officials and creditors, sat Weiss ― soft-spoken and stoic.  “From the beginning, we believed that the only solution was a comprehensive one through Congress ― a restructuring authority for all the debt,” Weiss recently told The Huffington Post. “We also believed that, with the safety and well-being of so many Americans at risk, Congress would ultimately act.‎”But it took months to get Congress to focus on the task, and Treasury needed to convince skeptics that Puerto Rico would otherwise face devastating cuts to essential services like health care, education, transportation and law enforcement. When Treasury first went to Congress in September, Weiss and others were met with incredulity. Democrats and Republicans alike asked why they didn’t just undertake some extraordinary palliative measure themselves. For starters: Treasury doesn’t have the unilateral authority to approve restructuring powers for the island. In October, Treasury returned with a detailed plan, taking time to dive into the arcane elements of Puerto Rico’s multifaceted debt and the inevitable defaults to come. From there, it took nine months to get a bill to the floor of the House, and another month on top of that to get it through the Senate.For Weiss, that meant 35 meetings on Capitol Hill, 20 meetings with Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla, five trips to the island and three congressional hearings. According to a source within the Garcia Padilla administration, it was Weiss who first articulated the need to craft a legal framework for restructuring and take it to Congress. He was the “architect,” the source said, clearing key hurdles in Congress that would have been impossible to manage without him.The first obstacle, and possibly the greatest, was apathy.“For whatever reason, Puerto Rico has very little credibility in Congress,” the Garcia Padilla administration source said. “The narrative being pushed by hedge funds, that this was just a reckless Latin American government that couldn’t get its tabs in order, was appealing to many members.” “To talk to them about doing something for Puerto Rico, doing something for Puerto Ricans, was like talking to them in a foreign language,” the source added.To help craft and move legislation to the floor, Treasury staffed up. Not only did it engage and meet with members, it built up a team to regularly talk to all stakeholders ― a wide array of creditors, labor interests and Puerto Rican businesses and lawmakers. Weiss met with the Progressive Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus and every sub-caucus that would listen to him. And when Secretary Lew trekked up to Capitol Hill, Weiss was nearby, joining in on meetings with House and Senate leaders of both parties.In the months of back-and-forth over minute details ― Treasury wanted all the debt covered, no exceptions ― Weiss remained in close contact with the House Republicans writing the bill, and with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). As it became clear Congress intended to introduce a legislative option to help Puerto Rico, the hedge funds moved in. Advertisements lambasting Congress, and Antonio Weiss specifically, blared across TVs and popped up in major newspapers and online. Full-page ads denounced Weiss for trying to bankrupt states, and others claimed the bill would be a huge cost to taxpayers. Ryan took that last one personally. When the Center for Individual Freedom started running TV ads painting the bill as a bailout at taxpayer expense, Ryan went to the mat, telling reporters it was offensive that groups were mischaracterizing the legislation. CFIF’s donors are anonymous, but it is suspected of being a front group for hedge funds that own Puerto Rico debt. The amount of opposition to helping Puerto Rico restructure its debt was massive. The conservative seniors’ group 60 Plus, helped by the financial backing of a few wealthy anonymous donors, formed the “Main Street Bondholders” group to run opposition. Hedge funds started suing the commonwealth before Congress even sent the final bill to the president’s desk. (As soon as the president signed the bill, an immediate stay on all litigation against the island took effect.)Democrats, meanwhile, had their own issues with the bill. Pelosi was able to deliver a strong vote in the House, but only after many decried the increased power afforded to the oversight board, and the provisions keeping minimum wage on the island below the national standard. “This was a difficult issue from the start and good people on both sides had passionate differences of opinion,” Rep. Nadia Velasquez (D-N.Y.) told HuffPost in an email. “The Department of Treasury and Antonio Weiss specifically were instrumental to bridging this gap and ensuring that Congress passed legislation ― even if imperfect ― to help stem the crisis in Puerto Rico.”After the long battle in the House, the Senate took up consideration of the bill with only a month to go before its summer break. The short time frame didn’t make it an easy sell for Treasury. In the days leading up to the vote, Weiss went back and forth with senators, especially Democrats who weren’t particularly happy with the compromises that came out of the House. On top of the minimum wage provision, Democrats were upset over the island’s exemption from new overtime rules, and wanted more pension protections for workers on the island. Weiss again helped navigate talks with senators, offering a “degree of credibility to the compromise,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).For Blumenthal, Weiss’ expertise and knowledge of financial issues from his time as a former Lazard investment banker ― amounting to roughly two decades on Wall Street ― were key in assuaging Democratic concerns. “What he added, in a sense, was a view as to what the extraordinary damage and dangers would be in the event of default and the consequences of postponing action,” Blumenthal said. Weiss laid out what would be likely to happen in the event of cascading catastrophes. Without preventative action, he said, the island would become isolated economically; unemployment would rise and essential services would be lost.Still, the bill isn’t perfect, and the oversight board is a concern not only for Blumenthal, but for a number of progressives and labor unions. “The [Puerto Rico] bill was simply one step with many inadequacies and downsides necessary for a compromise that would prevent chaos and catastrophe, but [it’s] not the end-all,” Blumenthal said. “The American people are very rightly frustrated about the partisan paralysis in Congress, and [the] bill reflects it, because it could have been a much more positive measure.”The commonwealth won’t rebound with restructuring alone. Blumenthal is hopeful Congress will work on legislation before the end of the year to boost the island’s health care programs, tax provisions and other economic programs. Without incentives provided by Congress, it remains to be seen if businesses will stay in Puerto Rico. A source within the labor movement (which never threw its support behind the bill) praised the Treasury Department and Weiss for being open throughout the entire process, but said it’s simply too soon to tell what the final outcome will be for the island and its people.The Garcia Padilla administration is cautiously optimistic as well. The source within the administration who spoke to HuffPost said the talk on the island from local media and residents is focused on the control board established under the bill. Many are worried that the board takes too much power away from the Puerto Rican government, and that the majority of seats given to Republicans could jeopardize a restructuring vote. Much of Weiss’ attention in the coming months will be on the oversight board, which is supposed to be formed by mid-September. Treasury hopes it happens sooner. While the restructuring bill can be notched as a win for Treasury, it’s just one piece in a larger process. The next step is setting up the oversight board. Seeing how well the board functions will play a crucial role in determining the administration’s success. “The strength of the restructuring tool can’t be understated. Is it perfect? No, you could probably find a technical improvement here or there,” Weiss said. “But does it work? Yes. And a year ago people were saying there’s no chance of such a tool getting adopted.‎”"

The creditor told Antonio Weiss, who would become the point person on the island’s fiscal crisis, that the Puerto Rico government should simply eliminate some waste and cut a certain number of jobs to pay back its debt. Don’t bet on Congress helping, the creditor said. A year ago, the idea of lawmakers lifting a finger to help the beleaguered commonwealth was indeed a pipe dream. But Weiss knew better. He told the creditor that history indicated otherwise. When Americans’ livelihoods are threatened, he said, Congress moves in. Puerto Rico is home to 3.5 million Americans.Earlier this summer, after a year of haggling and revising, Congress passed legislation allowing the commonwealth to restructure its $70 billion in debt under the supervision of an oversight board. The bill didn’t satisfy everyone, but it is nevertheless the only piece of major economic policy to pass Congress this year ― a sign of Treasury’s persistence in the face of incredible gridlock.At the center of those negotiations, and in countless meetings with lawmakers, labor unions, Puerto Rican officials and creditors, sat Weiss ― soft-spoken and stoic.  “From the beginning, we believed that the only solution was a comprehensive one through Congress ― a restructuring authority for all the debt,” Weiss recently told The Huffington Post. “We also believed that, with the safety and well-being of so many Americans at risk, Congress would ultimately act.‎”But it took months to get Congress to focus on the task, and Treasury needed to convince skeptics that Puerto Rico would otherwise face devastating cuts to essential services like health care, education, transportation and law enforcement. When Treasury first went to Congress in September, Weiss and others were met with incredulity. Democrats and Republicans alike asked why they didn’t just undertake some extraordinary palliative measure themselves. For starters: Treasury doesn’t have the unilateral authority to approve restructuring powers for the island. In October, Treasury returned with a detailed plan, taking time to dive into the arcane elements of Puerto Rico’s multifaceted debt and the inevitable defaults to come. From there, it took nine months to get a bill to the floor of the House, and another month on top of that to get it through the Senate.For Weiss, that meant 35 meetings on Capitol Hill, 20 meetings with Puerto Rico Gov. Alejandro Garcia Padilla, five trips to the island and three congressional hearings. According to a source within the Garcia Padilla administration, it was Weiss who first articulated the need to craft a legal framework for restructuring and take it to Congress. He was the “architect,” the source said, clearing key hurdles in Congress that would have been impossible to manage without him.The first obstacle, and possibly the greatest, was apathy.“For whatever reason, Puerto Rico has very little credibility in Congress,” the Garcia Padilla administration source said. “The narrative being pushed by hedge funds, that this was just a reckless Latin American government that couldn’t get its tabs in order, was appealing to many members.” “To talk to them about doing something for Puerto Rico, doing something for Puerto Ricans, was like talking to them in a foreign language,” the source added.To help craft and move legislation to the floor, Treasury staffed up. Not only did it engage and meet with members, it built up a team to regularly talk to all stakeholders ― a wide array of creditors, labor interests and Puerto Rican businesses and lawmakers. Weiss met with the Progressive Caucus, the Hispanic Caucus and every sub-caucus that would listen to him. And when Secretary Lew trekked up to Capitol Hill, Weiss was nearby, joining in on meetings with House and Senate leaders of both parties.In the months of back-and-forth over minute details ― Treasury wanted all the debt covered, no exceptions ― Weiss remained in close contact with the House Republicans writing the bill, and with House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). As it became clear Congress intended to introduce a legislative option to help Puerto Rico, the hedge funds moved in. Advertisements lambasting Congress, and Antonio Weiss specifically, blared across TVs and popped up in major newspapers and online. Full-page ads denounced Weiss for trying to bankrupt states, and others claimed the bill would be a huge cost to taxpayers. Ryan took that last one personally. When the Center for Individual Freedom started running TV ads painting the bill as a bailout at taxpayer expense, Ryan went to the mat, telling reporters it was offensive that groups were mischaracterizing the legislation. CFIF’s donors are anonymous, but it is suspected of being a front group for hedge funds that own Puerto Rico debt. The amount of opposition to helping Puerto Rico restructure its debt was massive. The conservative seniors’ group 60 Plus, helped by the financial backing of a few wealthy anonymous donors, formed the “Main Street Bondholders” group to run opposition. Hedge funds started suing the commonwealth before Congress even sent the final bill to the president’s desk. (As soon as the president signed the bill, an immediate stay on all litigation against the island took effect.)Democrats, meanwhile, had their own issues with the bill. Pelosi was able to deliver a strong vote in the House, but only after many decried the increased power afforded to the oversight board, and the provisions keeping minimum wage on the island below the national standard. “This was a difficult issue from the start and good people on both sides had passionate differences of opinion,” Rep. Nadia Velasquez (D-N.Y.) told HuffPost in an email. “The Department of Treasury and Antonio Weiss specifically were instrumental to bridging this gap and ensuring that Congress passed legislation ― even if imperfect ― to help stem the crisis in Puerto Rico.”After the long battle in the House, the Senate took up consideration of the bill with only a month to go before its summer break. The short time frame didn’t make it an easy sell for Treasury. In the days leading up to the vote, Weiss went back and forth with senators, especially Democrats who weren’t particularly happy with the compromises that came out of the House. On top of the minimum wage provision, Democrats were upset over the island’s exemption from new overtime rules, and wanted more pension protections for workers on the island. Weiss again helped navigate talks with senators, offering a “degree of credibility to the compromise,” said Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.).For Blumenthal, Weiss’ expertise and knowledge of financial issues from his time as a former Lazard investment banker ― amounting to roughly two decades on Wall Street ― were key in assuaging Democratic concerns. “What he added, in a sense, was a view as to what the extraordinary damage and dangers would be in the event of default and the consequences of postponing action,” Blumenthal said. Weiss laid out what would be likely to happen in the event of cascading catastrophes. Without preventative action, he said, the island would become isolated economically; unemployment would rise and essential services would be lost.Still, the bill isn’t perfect, and the oversight board is a concern not only for Blumenthal, but for a number of progressives and labor unions. “The [Puerto Rico] bill was simply one step with many inadequacies and downsides necessary for a compromise that would prevent chaos and catastrophe, but [it’s] not the end-all,” Blumenthal said. “The American people are very rightly frustrated about the partisan paralysis in Congress, and [the] bill reflects it, because it could have been a much more positive measure.”The commonwealth won’t rebound with restructuring alone. Blumenthal is hopeful Congress will work on legislation before the end of the year to boost the island’s health care programs, tax provisions and other economic programs. Without incentives provided by Congress, it remains to be seen if businesses will stay in Puerto Rico. A source within the labor movement (which never threw its support behind the bill) praised the Treasury Department and Weiss for being open throughout the entire process, but said it’s simply too soon to tell what the final outcome will be for the island and its people.The Garcia Padilla administration is cautiously optimistic as well. The source within the administration who spoke to HuffPost said the talk on the island from local media and residents is focused on the control board established under the bill. Many are worried that the board takes too much power away from the Puerto Rican government, and that the majority of seats given to Republicans could jeopardize a restructuring vote. Much of Weiss’ attention in the coming months will be on the oversight board, which is supposed to be formed by mid-September. Treasury hopes it happens sooner. While the restructuring bill can be notched as a win for Treasury, it’s just one piece in a larger process. The next step is setting up the oversight board. Seeing how well the board functions will play a crucial role in determining the administration’s success. “The strength of the restructuring tool can’t be understated. Is it perfect? No, you could probably find a technical improvement here or there,” Weiss said. “But does it work? Yes. And a year ago people were saying there’s no chance of such a tool getting adopted.‎”"

The video, which has not been verified, purports to show Pokemon Go trainers, as players are called, snarling traffic trying to chase down the Snorlax in nearby Beitou Park. Pokemon Go’s popularity may be dwindling in the U.S. since its release in early July, but the game has only been available in Taiwan since August 6, according to the tech website Polygon. The game’s dedicated ― and distracted ― fans have frequently wandered into trouble in their pursuit of the pocket monsters.At least 350 Taiwanese motorists have been fined for playing the game while on motorbikes since the game’s release, according to Agence France-Presse. “Catch the rare creatures, but don’t let accidents catch up with you!” Taiwan’s Premier Lin Chuan said via Facebook shortly after the game was released. In the U.S., two California men fell off a cliff trying to catch Pokemon. In mid-July, New Yorkers caused a stampede in Central Park while ― much like their Taiwanese counterparts ― chasing an ultra-rare Pokemon. This is how the world ends: not with a nuclear disaster or a meteor crashing into the earth, but with a stampede of Pokemon Go trainers. "
21,POLITICS,Donald Trump Jacked Up His Campaign’s Trump Tower Rent Once Somebody Else Was Paying It,S.V. Date,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-campaign-rent_us_57bba424e4b03d51368a82b9,Office rent soared in July after Trump's campaign began accepting donor contributions.,2016-08-23,"Some of the unfinished office space in Trump Tower that the Trump campaign had been paying $35,000 a month for until May. The campaign paid nearly $170,000 for its Trump Tower space in July.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bba7051800002100bcc6cb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― After bragging for a year about how cheaply he was running his campaign, Donald Trump is spending more freely now that other people are contributing ― particularly when the beneficiary is himself.Trump nearly quintupled the monthly rent his presidential campaign pays for its headquarters at Trump Tower to $169,758 in July, when he was raising funds from donors, compared with March, when he was self-funding his campaign, according to a Huffington Post review of Federal Election Commission filings. The rent jumped even though he was paying fewer staff in July than he did in March. The Trump campaign paid Trump Tower Commercial LLC $35,458 in March ― the same amount it had been paying since last summer ― and had 197 paid employees and consultants. In July, it paid 172 employees and consultants.“If I was a donor, I’d want answers,” said a prominent Republican National Committee member who supports Trump, asking for anonymity to speak freely. “If they don’t have any more staff, and they’re paying five times more? That’s the kind of stuff I’d read and try to make an (attack) ad out of it.”In addition to the rent for Trump Tower space in Manhattan, Trump has paid his eponymous golf courses and restaurants more than $260,000 since his campaign and the RNC struck a joint fundraising deal in mid-May, after he essentially locked up the GOP nomination. On May 18, the day the fundraising deal was announced, Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach was paid $29,715; Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida, was paid $35,845; and Trump Restaurants LLC was paid $125,080, according to FEC records. Such large payments were much rarer when Trump was self-funding.It’s unclear from the campaign filings the purpose of the golf course and restaurant payments, although both of the Florida golf courses hosted Trump campaign news conferences in March.The Trump campaign on Tuesday responded that it had expanded into larger quarters. “Also, Mr. Trump makes a personal contribution of $2 million per month to the campaign, obviously a much higher amount than rent,” the statement said.Steven Cheung, a campaign spokesman, said the increased office space was needed to accommodate an anticipated increase in employees. “We’re constantly adding new staff and in the subsequent weeks after convention, we’ve done that,” he said.While campaign officials have been promising a larger general election staff for months, though, that has yet to happen.The FEC filings show that Trump began increasing the rent at Trump Tower starting with the May 31 payment of $72,800. The Trump campaign paid $110,684 in rent on June 9, and $169,758 on July 10.The campaign’s number of paid employees and consultants went from 166 in May, to 139 in June, to 172 in July. How many of those actually worked in Trump Tower cannot be determined from the FEC filings, although typically only a small fraction of a presidential campaign’s staff works in the headquarters building. Last autumn, only about a dozen of the campaign’s several dozen paid employees worked in Manhattan.Trump continues to fly to campaign events on his personal Boeing 757 airliner, even though the aging jet burns some $10,000 in fuel every hour. That has made air travel one of the biggest expense categories for his campaign. In July alone, $495,000 went to Trump’s company that owns the plane.Prior to May, three-quarters of the $59 million spent by Trump’s campaign had come out of his own pocket ― meaning that whatever Trump charged his campaign for rent was largely coming from Trump himself.That situation is now entirely reversed. Trump’s money makes up a tiny percentage of his campaign’s spending. The bulk now comes from outside donors, both small-dollar givers and those writing maximum-limit checks of $2,700.“Nobody cares when you’re spending your own money, but when you’re spending the donor’s $27, that could cause problems,” the RNC member said, adding that small donors especially may not be sympathetic to Trump’s extravagance. “Most campaigns run on a much tighter budget.”For many months, Trump’s campaign prided itself on its low-rent operation. It invited reporters in to tour its headquarters on the fifth floor of Trump Tower that had once been used as production offices for “The Apprentice” TV show, which starred Trump. Photos and video from those tours show work space with unfinished ceilings, makeshift drywall partitions, and only a few campaign workers.Commercial real estate is available in the midtown Manhattan neighborhood in the range of $70 per square foot annually, although Trump has charged more than that. Trump Tower rented 9,000 feet of office space in December at $120 per square foot, but has been unable to rent a 15,000 square-foot office that includes six terraces overlooking Fifth Avenue, even at a discounted rent of $90 per square foot.Democrat Hillary Clinton has been leasing two entire floors in a Brooklyn office building totaling 80,000 square feet since the start of her campaign. The rent for that space has been about $212,000 per month. Her campaign staff is also several times the size of Trump’s, numbering more than 700 for the better part of a year.This post has been updated with comments from Trump’s campaign.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S.Sign up for the HuffPost Must Reads newsletter.

22,THE WORLDPOST,Lessons From The Syrian Opposition's Aleppo Offensive,"Mohammed Alaa Ghanem , ContributorSyrian academic, writer, pro-democracy campaigner, and human r...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lessons-from-the-syrian-oppositions-aleppo-offensive_us_57bc8d46e4b07d22cc39c4eb,"Only one month ago, Syria’s largest city of Aleppo seemed on the cusp of humanitarian catastrophe. Some 350,000 civilians",2016-08-23,"A man walks past destroyed buildings in a neighborhood of Aleppo, Syria, that was recently targeted by regime airstrikes. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bc91f01600002d00bfde65.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Only one month ago, Syria’s largest city of Aleppo seemed on the cusp of humanitarian catastrophe. Some 350,000 civilians in eastern Aleppo had been placed under siege by Assad regime forces, and humanitarian supplies were running out. The head of key regime ally Hezbollah boasted of having defeated “regional imperial ambitions” in Aleppo. Assad’s main backer Russia triumphantly announced “humanitarian corridors” for civilians to evacuate, as humanitarian organizations expressed concern for those left behind and warned of a repeat of Russia’s vicious assault on Grozny in 2000.President Obama had practically ruled out U.S. action to save the 350,000 civilians under siege, instead reiterating his longstanding position that no more could be done. Obama vowed to “test” if another “cessation of hostilities” might yield fruit even though a Russian blitzkrieg during the previous cessation had made the siege of Aleppo possible. It looked like Aleppo was doomed to a humanitarian disaster that would churn out tens of thousands more refugees.Less than 48 hours later, the siege on Aleppo was broken, with peripheral U.S. involvement. Instead, the hardline rebel coalition Jaish al-Fatah led a massive offensive incorporating rebels from across northern Syria. Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, which only recently broke ties with Al-Qaeda, was integral to the offensive and came away with more legitimacy than ever before. If the U.S. truly wishes to combat extremism or broker peace in Syria, it must learn the right lessons from the rebels’ Aleppo offensive.The first lesson is that dictator Bashar al-Assad’s position is fundamentally weak. After five years of exploiting the minority Alawite sect, then importing Shiite foreign fighters to quell a popular uprising, Assad forces have begun recruiting prisoners and teachers to relieve a growing manpower shortage. Reports from the rebel offensive showed regime recruits refusing to fight or fleeing en masse from their positions.Following the offensive, thousands of Iraqi and Lebanese Shiite reinforcements arrived in Aleppo to fight for the regime; Russian bombers initiated intensive air raids, and Iran allowed these bombers to take off from its territory in a decision unprecedented since World War Two; and the pro-regime side still failed to advance. The recent offensive made clear that Syria will never again be stable with Assad in power.The second lesson, one related to the first, is that Syrians must be accounted for in America’s Syria policy. They can not be dismissed as, in President Obama’s words, “former doctors, farmers, [and] pharmacists.” Participants in the “Great Battle of Aleppo” were close to 100 percent Syrian. Nearly all territory gained in the offensive was attacked, conquered, and held by Syrians. These are the farmers and pharmacists that the president spoke of, and they are a formidable force with staying power.If the anti-Assad rebels are in fact here to stay, then American relations with the opposition must be properly managed. Herein lies the third lesson, one that 51 diplomats tried in vain to convey to the Obama Administration in a June 2016 dissent memo: “Failure to stem Assad’s flagrant abuses will only bolster the ideological appeal of groups such as [ISIS].”During the most recent diplomatic talks in February, the administration heavily pressured the opposition to soften demands for Assad’s departure. It offered no military leverage to the rebels, even when Russia provided plenty to the regime side, and even though Russia made a mockery of a joint U.S.-Russian ceasefire violations monitoring room by denying that regime violations had occurred.By the end of the talks in April, chief opposition negotiator Riad Hijab was so frustrated by lack of U.S. support that he declared: “We will fight even with stones... We demand that the United States shoulder its responsibility.” Bashar al-Assad, for his part, later credited the talks with facilitating massive military gains for his forces. But the administration responded mainly by initiating discussions with Russia for joint military cooperation in Syria.The result was just as the 51 diplomats predicted: extremist groups such as Jabhat Fatah al-Sham gained unprecedented credence, by freeing 350,000 civilians from siege two days after the American president insisted that no more could be done.This leads us to a fourth and final lesson, one that points directly to policy solutions: American military action to protect civilians and promote a diplomatic solution in Syria is eminently feasible. Skeptics of U.S. action against Assad like to issue dark predictions of “boots on the ground” or “dogfights with Russian jets.” But rebel fighters, in only one week, reversed six months of Russian-Iranian-regime efforts to besiege Aleppo without either of these events occurring. At most, rebels received an infusion of ground-to-ground artillery from foreign backers in advance of their offensive.Rather than attempting to extort the opposition regarding the departure of Assad, the U.S. should empower moderate rebels so that they emerge as the main defenders of Syrian civilians, starting with the U.S.-backed rebels that joined the Great Battle of Aleppo. The CIA-backed Sham Legion is a Jaish al-Fatah member and played a leading role on the southern end of the offensive. The broad Fatah Halab coalition, which includes many CIA-backed groups, scored notable gains by attacking the regime from within Aleppo. Even civilians played a role by burning tires to impede regime air raids ― and hardline and moderate rebels agreed that civilians, including minorities, must not be targeted or besieged.While the Aleppo offensive brought new legitimacy to hardline groups such as Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, it also underscored that U.S.-backed rebels and Syrian civil society remain integral to opposition efforts. The U.S. can best promote a political settlement by providing robust support to moderate rebels so that they, too, can spearhead major offensives against the Assad regime. This would pressure the Assad to negotiate, while ensuring that moderate rebels are his main interlocutors when he comes to the table.Mohammed Alaa Ghanem is the director of government relations and a senior political adviser at the Syrian American Council and a Millennium Leadership Fellow at the Atlantic Council "
23,POLITICS,Health Risks Don't Make For A Bad President,"Gillian Branstetter, ContributorGillian Branstetter is a writer living in Central Pennsylvania",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/health-risks-dont-make-for-a-bad-president_us_57bcbbf0e4b029a9a467cede,Rumors about Clinton's health highlight Trump's growing desperation.,2016-08-23,"U.S. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton speaks at Futuramic Tool & Engineering in Warren, Michigan August 11, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bcbd171800009a0fbcca0d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Like so many rotted fish, the absurd rumors about Hillary Clinton’s health have risen from the murky depths of fringe alt-right forums and have flopped to the frothy top of the GOP. Fox News pundit and Trump adviser Sean Hannity devoted a full hour of his show to investigating the rumors. Trump advocate Rudy Giuliani offered doctored Youtube videos as evidence of Clinton’s ailing state. Trump himself — who appears to treat the Drudge Report and his Twitter mentions as official briefings — told a rally,“[Clinton} also lacks the mental and physical stamina to take on ISIS, and all the many adversaries we face.”Putting aside the notion that presidents don’t fight terrorists in hand-to-hand combat, it’s important to consider what these theories hope to accomplish. They reveal the desperation of Trump and his supporters to disqualify Clinton from the office of the presidency and continue a political trend of believing your ideological opponent is not merely less qualified but is, in fact, illegitimate or inherently disqualified.And the health of a presidential candidate is an oft-considered issue within an election, hence the tradition of campaigns to release doctors’ notes and records to assure the American public of their candidate’s physical state. John McCain faced many questions concerning his health in 2008 and liberals roundly criticized the 72-year-old for not releasing them. A group of nearly 3,000 doctors even signed a petition urging McCain to release his records.The question remains, however, whether this is a useful practice or not. Is a president’s performance impacted by their physical health or age?One of the most famous answers to this question should be the presidency of Ronald Reagan. The oldest president on record had four surgeries during his presidency, and that’s if you don’t count the medical response to being thrown from a horse or being shot in the stomach in an assassination attempt. In 1983, the Gipper announced he wore a hearing aid, but instead of spurring rumors about his health, it was a sales boost for the hearing aid he used.None of those started the kinds of investigations from afar, however, quite like his post-presidency announcement that he had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s. Speculation ran rampant that a supposed habit of forgetting names or dozing off in Cabinet meetings meant Reagan had been hiding his deteriorating mental health long before his presidency had ended.Professionals doubt this. Writes Lawrence Altman — the legendary medical reporter who worked for the New York Times for 40 years — in 1998:Just when the Alzheimer’s began can never be known. But while the line between mere forgetfulness and the beginning of Alzheimer’s can be fuzzy, a matter of gradation, Mr. Reagan’s four main White House doctors say they saw no evidence that he had crossed it as President. They saw and spoke with him daily in the White House, they said, and beyond the natural failings of age never found his memory, reasoning or judgment to be significantly impaired.Still, Reagan’s son seems to believe his father showed symptoms of the disease as early as 1986 and a 2015 analysis of the president’s speech patterns suggests the disease might have been evident long before his 1994 diagnosis.Considering the debilitating effect Alzheimer’s can have on the mental state of those with it, one might consider the questions worthwhile. But whether you agree with Reagan’s policies or not, its nearly impossible to suggest the government or the nation was effected by the state of his physical or mental health.Consider, in fact, the health of John F. Kennedy, the youngest person ever elected to be president. While partially popular for his youth and apparent virility, Kennedy actively worked to keep his decades of health problems a secret. He was famously read the Last Rites three times as a child and took scores of medications while president. From biographer Robert Dallek:In particular, steroid treatments that he may have received as a young man for his intestinal ailments could have compounded — and perhaps even caused — both the Addison’s disease and the degenerative back trouble that plagued him later in life. Travell’s prescription records also confirm that during his presidency — and in particular during times of stress, such as the Bay of Pigs fiasco, in April of 1961, and the Cuban missile crisis, in October of 1962 — Kennedy was taking an extraordinary variety of medications: steroids for his Addison’s disease; painkillers for his back; anti-spasmodics for his colitis; antibiotics for urinary-tract infections; antihistamines for allergies; and, on at least one occasion, an anti-psychotic (though only for two days) for a severe mood change that Jackie Kennedy believed had been brought on by the antihistamines.Though brought down by an assassin’s bullet three years into his presidency, there is little evidence any of his various ailments or medications had any effect on his presidency. Similar to Franklin Roosevelt’s battle with polio, they were a backdrop to his time in office though never a driving force.Considering these two stories of presidential health — one from our oldest president and another from one of our youngest — it makes the Clinton health rumors all the more insane. Hannity, Giuliani and the many conservative forums dedicated to this very question are accusing her of suffering from seizures, hiding brain injuries, or otherwise showing erratic symptoms of various neurological illnesses.Maybe she suffers from cluster headaches, like Thomas Jefferson. Maybe she’ll have a stroke, like Eisenhower. Maybe she has any one of the long list of health issues that have effected presidents of the past. And while these rumors are completely untrue and cooked out of the minds of desperate people attempting to delegitimize a women’s ability to serve, it’s important to consider Colin Powell’s response to the rumors about Barack Obama’s faith — would it be a bad thing if they were true?"

I never knew just how inaccurate until a good friend (and good man) had his character slandered by the North Carolina Republican Party.Democrat Andrew Barnhill is running a tight race against incumbent Republican Senator Michael Lee for Senate District 9 in Eastern North Carolina. Although the race for N.C. Senate is among the least competitive in the country (thanks largely to Republican gerrymandering), Andrew has been running a tight campaign, both because Senate District 9 has more Democrats than most and because Andrew is a beloved member of the local community who’s lived there since his childhood. It’s little wonder N.C. Republicans are anxious.That anxiety doesn’t excuse defamation.Earlier this month, North Carolina Republicans launched a website slandering Andrew as “Party Boy Barnhill” based off the disputed allegations of a man who met Barnhill for less than a few hours during a charity trip Andrew took to Africa while at Furman University. The website was based off a news article that reads more like an op-ed than an investigative piece and that has already been challenged for its inclusion of numerous inaccuracies.Unfortunately, that didn’t stop the N.C. GOP from going further than its website launch, sending out flyers to voting members of Andrew’s community calling him “immature,” “unethical,” and “scandalous,” and labeling him―bizarrely, for anyone who actually knows Andrew―an “extreme manipulator.”The original source for the allegations spoke to Andrew for a few hours over a span of five days. I’ve spoken with Andrew―often seeking spiritual, political, and life advice―for countless hours over a span of five years. The “Andrew Barnhill” that the N.C. Republican Party is attempting to manufacture out of thin air bears no resemblance to the inspiring man I got to know during my time at Duke University.I’m incredibly disappointed in the state of our national political discourse, but I’m even more disappointed to see such vitriolic discourse infect the politics of my home state in an attempt to mislead voters about the character of one of the kindest, most empathetic, and most intelligent humans I’ve ever known.Although Andrew is no “extreme manipulator,” by launching these defamatory ads, the N.C. GOP has ironically acted as an “extreme manipulator.” It’s trying to mislead North Carolinians about Andrew Barnhill’s character in order to distract from its shameful record on everything from workers’ rights to gay rights to African-American rights.The “Party Boy Barnhill” slander is “immature,” “unethical” and “scandalous.” Andrew Barnhill, however, is not.Shame on the N.C. GOP."

Ralph Lauren said that its endorsement deal with Lochte was specifically for the 2016 Games and that it would not be renewing his contract, according to CNN. The company said in a statement that it “continues to proudly sponsor the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Team and the values that its athletes embody.”Before that announcement, Ralph Lauren had removed Lochte’s image from the “Meet Our Athletes” page on its website, Complex reported Sunday.Another of Lochte’s sponsors, Syneron-Candela, which manufactures laser-based hair-removal devices, among other things, also announced Monday it would cease its partnership with the swimmer.“We hold our employees to high standards,” the company said in a release, “and we expect the same of our business partners.”Last week, the CEO of Airweave, a Japanese mattress manufacturer, told Bloomberg the company didn’t intend to drop Lochte as a sponsor “so long as he is a respectable athlete.”The company’s perception of his respectability seems to have changed over the weekend, as Airweave announced Monday it, too, had no interest in a continued sponsorship.Lochte admitted Saturday that he exaggerated a story about being robbed at gunpoint in Rio de Janeiro with three other American swimmers, while authorities debunked the whole account as an outright lie. Brazilian sources told ABC News on Thursday that surveillance video from that night actually showed one of the swimmers fighting with a gas station security guard and causing damage to a restroom. Lochte and the other swimmers appear drunk and disorderly in the surveillance footage. This article has been updated with statements from Ralph Lauren, Syneron-Candela and Airweave."

This is remarkable even coming from a dedicated pot-stirrer like Stone, because McCaughey is widely considered a fraud by liberal and conservative public health experts.“I travel in the Trump campaign circles, Betsy, and your name does keep popping up as a potential secretary for health and human services. From my mouth to God’s ears,” Stone said on his radio show Saturday.“I would be so honored to serve in a Trump administration,” McCaughey replied. “And I would be so thrilled to fix this broken system and really give people choices again, and much more affordable health insurance. The idea of passing a law that everybody has to buy this one-size-fits-all government-designed plan ― it’s like passing a law where the only car you’re allowed to buy is a four-door sedan. The assumption is you’re too stupid to put the top up if you pick a convertible or close the hatchback if you choose one of those.”McCaughey was recently named to Trump’s team of economic advisers for, well, who knows. Although she served one term as lieutenant governor of New York, McCaughey is best known for a series of wildly untrue claims about the Affordable Care Act.Critiquing her preposterous assertions again is a fool’s errand, but here goes anyway.No, Obamacare is not the health insurance equivalent of requiring everyone to buy a four-door sedan. It’s more like requiring every make and model of car to have seat belts and functional brakes.There are all kinds of different insurance plans available under Obamacare, as people who have actually shopped on the heath care exchanges can attest. Policies are divided into bronze, silver, gold and platinum plans, and private-sector insurers offer variations within each category. The system has, in fact, been criticized for allowing too many different options, resulting in a confusing process for consumers.For McCaughey, the sedan analogy was a relatively tame exaggeration. She has never served in a federal administration at any point during her 68 years on earth for the simple reason that even hardline conservatives do not believe she is a credible expert. HuffPost wrote up everything you need to know about her last week:In 1994, she claimed that Hillary Clinton’s health care reform plan would bar people from purchasing care outside the new Clinton system, which would cruelly ration treatments to curb costs. It wasn’t true. The magazine that published the article would later disavow it.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims ― 1.6 billion members of an entire religion ― from entering the U.S."

Peyton Manning is gone, yet we hardly flinched. The always polarizing Cam Newton is ready to build on his first MVP season, Russell Wilson comes off the greatest stretch in league history, Drew Brees is timeless at 37 and Aaron Rodgers has his full supporting cast healthy. And we know Andrew Luck is armed and ready, as are young guns Jameis Winston and Derek Carr.But quarterbacks are just one part of the equation in 2016. The rooks are always entertaining ― just take last year for example ― and who can forget about the league’s never-ending coaching carousel?With that in mind, here are five bold predictions as we get set to kick another NFL season off.Rex Ryan Won’t Last 16 Games We could go with San Diego’s head man Mike McCoy here, or perhaps the Rams’ Jeff Fisher, but Ryan ― who enters his second year in Buffalo ― faces tremendous scrutiny after failing to compile a quality defense in 2015. Remember, the Bills put together elite numbers in 2014 on that side of the ball, only to falter when their defensive-minded head coach came on board. The Bills ranked a measly 19th in total defense and just 15th in points allowed per game. Ryan, as we know, tends to wear his teams down, and last year seemed to be no different.Quarterback Tyrod Taylor flashed moments of stardom, but failed to eclipse the 200-yard mark in Buffalo’s final two games. Star running back LeSean McCoy can’t stay out of trouble, and the super talented second-year man Karlos Williams ― who was slapped with a four-game suspension after violating the league’s substance abuse policy ― was just released. Surely it’s not fair to put that on Ryan, but the general lack of discipline of his teams has always been an issue. The outspoken head coach signed a five-year contract, but don’t expect the front office to be that patient: The Bills haven’t been to the playoffs in 17 years, the longest streak in professional sports.Ben Roethlisberger Breaks Single Season Yardage RecordThe 34-year-old Roethlisberger nearly amassed the 4K mark last season, and yet he played just 12 games. Even with deep ball magnet Martavis Bryant suspended for the whole year, Big Ben will be chucking it like never before. Antonio Brown is an unstoppable force of nature who destroys everyone and does it lining up all over the field. Le’Veon Bell ― suspended three games ― caught 83 balls in 2014, and presents as dangerous a play-action threat as there is.The bottom line is that Mike Tomlin loves to throw and he loves to take shots down the field; Roethlisberger is a deep ball master. He will also lean on speed demon Markus Wheaton, who caught 28 passes for 476 yards and four touchdowns during Pittsburgh’s final six games. And watch out for talented second-year man Sammie Coates and promising 23-year-old slot man Eli Rogers, a former undrafted free agent out of Louisville. Simply put, Peyton Manning’s record of 5,477 yards ― set in 2013 ― is in serious jeopardy.Cowboys Win NFC EastWe always seem to talk about worst to first in the NFL. Dallas, which won just four games in 2015 ― mostly because of Tony Romo’s clavicle injury ― is primed for a possible playoff run.Romo ― who will be kept upright all year ― is healthy, and so too is Dez Bryant, a perennial All-Pro who hasn’t been able to stay on the field. The offensive impetus for Dallas may become rookie running back Ezekiel Elliott, whom Dallas took with the fourth overall pick in the draft. Elliott, while inexperienced, is just the type of physical, patient runner built to succeed behind the league’s premier offensive line. Like DeMarco Murray, Elliott should excel.Defensively, the Cowboys will be tasked with defending two potentially explosive offenses in the NFC East: Washington and New York. The defensive line is very young, but the return of DeMarcus Lawrence and Randy Gregory ― all of whom were suspended last year ― could prove lethal. With a soft schedule for Romo and Bryant to feast on, it’s not unreasonable to assume Dallas flips the script in 2016.RG3 Wins Comeback Player Of The YearKansas City’s Jamaal Charles is the sexy choice here, and there are a whole host of others (think Jimmy Graham, Eddie Lacy, Thomas Rawls, Arian Foster or Andrew Luck), but Griffin has a real chance in Cleveland. I’ve been bullish on him all summer, and his recent preseason play ― check this dime to Gary Barnidge ― shows he may just be ready.In fact, no franchise in the NFL has gone through more quarterbacks than the Browns ― over 20 in fact since they returned to Cleveland in 1999 ― but Griffin may just be the guy to end that woeful stretch. Healthy and armed with a quality offensive line and defense, RG3 will rely heavily on former All-Pro wideout Josh Gordon and rookie speedster Corey Coleman, a first rounder out of Baylor who can fly. Griffin didn’t play a single snap of football last year, and perhaps that’s a good thing. Reports have been positive in camp ― All-Pro left tackle Joe Thomas tells The Huffington Post he is improving ― and he has the added benefit of Barnidge at tight end and an emerging tailback in Duke Johnson. Undoubtedly, there are a lot of what ifs, but Griffin and the Browns offense should be noticeably improved this season under newly minted head coach Hue Jackson.Sterling Shepard Wins Offensive Rookie Of The YearThis is a stretch, especially considering the assortment of uber-talented rookies (e.g. Coleman, Elliott, Laquon Treadwell, Josh Doctson, C.J. Procise and Tyler Boyd) ― and the fact that the average rookie season for second -ound receivers comes out to 28 catches for 359 yards and two touchdowns, according to Pro-Football-Reference. But Shepard, drafted 40th overall out of Oklahoma, is a difference maker who will benefit greatly from lining up next to and opposite Odell Beckham Jr.Blessed with tremendous hands and quickness, his versatility will keep him on the field for a Giants offense that has gotten little production aside from OBJ over the past two years. The oft-injured Victor Cruz remains a huge question mark, and Eli Manning ― along with offensive coordinator Bob McAdoo ― would love nothing more than for the dynamic and shifty Shepard to burst onto the scene.Shepard ― whose father won a Super Bowl with the Redskins ― absolutely dominated the Big 12 as a senior, amassing nearly 1,300 yards and 11 touchdowns. The comparison can be made to fellow Big 12 product Tyler Lockett, another 5-foot-10 wide receiver. Lockett, drafted in the third round, enjoyed a fabulous rookie campaign in Seattle last year, totaling almost 700 yards receiving and eight total touchdowns, while earning Pro Bowl honors as a return specialist. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said Le’Veon Bell was suspended for four games. His suspension, initially four games, was reduced to three games upon appeal. Also, an earlier version stated the Bills have not reached the playoffs in 16 years, the second longest drought in the league. The correct number is 17 years, which is the longest drought in the league. In addition, Rolando McClain was suspended in June, and has since been omitted from the portion on the Cowboys.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related on Twitter at @Schultz_Report, and follow me on Instagram at @Schultz_Report.

Jefferson County is one of the most densely populated counties in Colorado, a battleground state where GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump was recently trailing Democrat Hillary Clinton, by 14 percentage points. The Trump campaign announced a new office there this month. Laurel Imer identifies as the West Denver Field Coordinator for Trump on Facebook. She told KDVR News she is delegating responsibility to her 12-year-old son, Weston. He is reportedly coordinating volunteers for Trump and hopes to lead the office until he starts school in September.Weston appears to defer to his mother, and isn’t running the office alone. In an interview with a radio show, “Rush to Reason,” published on July 7, he said he was “co-chair for the Jefferson County Trump campaign, underneath her.” The host was surprised by Weston’s age when he called in. “Hi mom!” he said. “Sorry! I thought this was a sir!” a host said, adding, “You’re just young ... OK, I get it now.” Weston told him, “It’s OK, I get it a lot.” He went on to explain he is also in charge of Colorado Kids for Trump, a group for children, particularly those who are “bullied at school because ... they like Trump.” He noted that he has been “bullied a lot” for that reason.Imer told the host that she and her son saw Sarah Palin and Trump speak at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver in July. As of July 31, she had not received money from the Trump campaign, according to Federal Election Commission filings.The Guardian reported last month that an alternate delegate candidate received a voicemail from a 12-year-old who claimed to speak on behalf of the Trump campaign and the Colorado Republican Party, and argued the party did not support efforts to derail Trump’s nomination. The 12-year-old Trump supporter reportedly called another person to warn of a plot to give the nomination to Jeb Bush. It’s unclear if this 12-year-old was Weston. Weston met Republican vice presidential nominee and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence backstage at a town hall this month, and asked him a question about Common Core education standards, according to KMGH-TV. He told the news outlet, “I gave him my information and he said him and Mr. Trump would be in contact with me as soon as possible.” He added, “I’ve got to take my phone off of silent.”Attempts to reach Imer and her son were not successful.Robert Blaha, Trump’s Colorado co-chair, acknowledged that Weston helps out, but denied the boy actually runs the operation. “There’s not the possibility a 12-year-old can run an office,” he told The Associated Press. Patrick Davis, the director of Trump’s campaign in Colorado, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But in an article about the new office last week, he told CBS 4, “We think the race is getting closer, not that the gap is getting wider, here in Colorado.” Trump is nonetheless running a lean, unorthodox campaign that has some Republicans worried it’s too late to build an infrastructure that can compete with Clinton’s. This article has been updated with comments from Blaha and reports from The Guardian and KMGH-TV.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

We're through the looking glass, folks!",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you were to take a wholly objective, clear-eyed view of recent current events, there seems to be no doubt about one thing that is going on in America: Donald Trump is running for president.Right?Going strictly by the look of things, it really does appear that Donald Trump, aside from being modern life’s most hateful engine of ruthless mischief, is indeed some sort of candidate for president. He has participated in the GOP primaries, won a requisite amount of delegates and became his party’s nominee. They had a big convention and everything to confirm this before our eyes. And now, he is out on the “campaign trail” ostensibly trying to “win votes.”So it would seem that this is just a fact: Donald Trump is running a completely real and legitimate presidential campaign. Counterpoint: Or is he? We bring this up because from time to time, ever since “Donald Trump is running for president” became a thing in our lives, there have been substantial inquiries into whether this is actually happening. Rumors have been whispered. Outlandish conspiracies have been suggested. And everywhere ― even among rational observers ― doubts are being expressed about whether what we are seeing happen before our eyes is really what is happening. What if the Trump campaign is some sort of elaborate con or a cunning plan that went sideways? Now, this campaign is apparently attempting to “pivot.” By merely saying this, it induces the political press to perform the ancient ritual of acknowledging the pivot. But from what is the campaign pivoting, and where is it heading next? This is an intriguing question, if for no other reason than we never seemed to come to an agreement on whether this presidential bid ever had a fixed point in the first place.By my count, there are five popular theories on what the Trump presidential candidacy actually is/has been all this while:So let us consider each of these theories in order, shall we?Theory #1: Donald Trump actually wants to win the presidential race.Normally, when someone announces that he or she intends to run for president, we process this information at face value and accept it as truth. Sometimes, of course, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson runs for president and it’s clear that he just wants to sell a lot of books. But this is the exception that proves the rule, let’s say. Anyway! Maybe Donald Trump is actually running for president, and even wants to win.This is not as crazy a notion as it sounds! In fact, it’s very possible that what we all observe as “crazy” in the context of a Trump candidacy is simply the means by which he hopes to win the election, not the end in itself.Moreover, the way we have come to view Trump’s bid as abnormal may have more to do with our own bias toward what we have come to accept as the governing fundamentals of our elections. Things like “the party decides,” and “the candidate must make a centrist pivot,” and “it seems weird that this campaign isn’t spending any money or hiring any people.”But Trump has always presented his candidacy as a sui generis event in American politics, one that’s skeptical of elite institutions and disdainful of hoary convention. He has a unique theory about how he is going to win this thing, to which he has stayed more or less constant. He believes that his celebrity and his reality-show skill set will help him earn free media. He contends that his place outside “the system” will allow him to “disrupt” the stupid old Beltway way of doing things. And he is pretty sure that these factors, combined, will help him turn out hundreds of thousands of voters who have previously stayed at home on Election Day ― which means that all those polls everyone cites, mostly to his detriment ― could potentially be wrong.To many, these notions seem cracked. But Trump would respond that we just don’t get it, man, and we’re all headed for a rude awakening. Donald Trump is running for president his way ― and his way is going to work.Theory #2: Donald Trump never wanted this whole presidential campaign thing to get this far, and he is desperate to lose. Then again, does Trump actually want to win the election? This has, for a while now, been a matter of discussion among those who have observed Trump’s campaign. And it’s not for nothing they’ve been talking. Trump has been hesitant to do many of the basic things that a traditional campaign does, like spend money on advertising, hire staff, build out a ground game, build out a data team, build out a rapid-response media operation or, really, build anything at all or put campaign funds to productive use. (It looks like this is finally turning around for the campaign, but it’s coming at an awfully late hour ― and only after a torrent of criticism.)Along the way, Trump has crisscrossed the electoral map, mixing up battleground state appearances with rallies in places like Connecticut, which he is going to lose. And he just can’t seem to stop re-settling the same old scores. He renewed his “Ted Cruz’s dad helped kill Kennedy” conspiracy-mongering the day after the GOP convention ended. He kept his conflict with grieving father Khizr Khan brewing for two unnecessary weeks, rather than simply move past the moment with some polite words. And every time his wranglers seem to get him to stick to a daily message and the tranquilizing effects of the teleprompter, he goes rogue again.Now, as The Huffington Post’s Sam Stein reports, GOP insiders aren’t sure that Trump isn’t actively trying to tank this thing. They may be a little late to the realization. A few weeks ago, former Obama adviser David Axelrod pointed out on CNN, “If Donald Trump were trying to lose this election — and I’m not saying he is — but if he were, I’m not sure he’d behave any differently than he has in the last few days.” Back in June, Real Clear Politics’ Carl Cannon took the measure of Trump’s effort and concluded that he was “looking for a way out.” As early as March, Stephanie Cegielski, the former communications director of the Trump-supporting Make America Great Again super PAC, wrote an essay for XOJane in which she warned Trump’s followers, “I don’t think even Trump thought he would get this far. And I don’t even know that he wanted to, which is perhaps the scariest prospect of all.”And, you know, maybe he fears the possibility as well. For the longest time, Trump’s political act has been to play the potshot-firing gadfly, happily enumerating all the dumb losers in Washington. Becoming president might be his worse nightmare, because then the roles would be reversed ― only he’d have an army of critics waiting gleefully with knives out. It’s tough to go from being the guy who always pointed out everyone else’s failings to being the man with the target on his back ― and while he would never publicly cop to them, Trump is fully aware of his own limitations.It’s a basic question: Does Trump want to win or lose? But before you get too hung up on figuring out that answer, let’s consider some more specific ― and, perhaps, crazier ― theories.Theory #3: Donald Trump’s “presidential campaign” is just an elaborate setup to an exciting second act in his life as the mogul at the center of a media empire.In a recent interview with the Portland Press Herald, Trump was asked, “What was the best deal you ever made?” ― to which he responded, “Maybe the West Side Railroad Yards on the west side of Manhattan.” Strictly speaking, that deal was an utter disaster, on which Trump lost scads of money and, ultimately, the right to develop the site.But Trump’s unrealized ambitions for that parcel still speak volumes about his self-conception. What he had wanted to do was build a new home for NBC to replace its Rockefeller Center haunts. Depending on what version of his proposal you’re reading about, his name for this dream development was either “Television City” or, perhaps more properly, “Trump City.”Trump has, deep down, always been a creature of the media. His ascent into Manhattan’s high society was paced by his constant feeding of the media beast ― which he did with zesty deftness. Becoming a reality-television showman ― for NBC, natch ― was a logical stage in his evolution. It got him jacked to the thrilling rush of ratings success, and it taught him a valuable new set of media tropes to deploy. So it is perhaps no surprise at all that, as the GOP primaries were winding down, Trump’s rumored focus was not on the White House, but on the klieg lights and the camera lens. As Vanity Fair’s Sarah Ellison reported in June:According to several people briefed on the discussions, the presumptive Republican nominee is examining the opportunity presented by the “audience” currently supporting him. He has also discussed the possibility of launching a “mini-media conglomerate” outside of his existing TV-production business, Trump Productions LLC. He has, according to one of these people, enlisted the consultation of his daughter Ivanka Trump and son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who owns The New York Observer. Trump’s rationale, according to this person, is that, “win or lose, we are onto something here. We’ve triggered a base of the population that hasn’t had a voice in a long time.” Flash-forward to today, and Trump is replacing Paul Manafort, a professionally focused campaign manager, with Breitbart News boss Steve Bannon, whose own journey from the world of business to the media stage saw Bannon catching the same bug and learning to love the same dizzy thrills. Bannon’s ascension to the top of Trump’s campaign suggests, to some, that Trump has already accepted he’s not winning the election, and the time is ripe to put together the next act.Subsequent reporting by The New York Times pointed in one particular direction:As comfortable as Mr. Trump may feel with Mr. Bannon’s style of politics, their unconventional alliance, and the possibility that the coming weeks could resemble a conservative publicity tour more than a conventional White House run, fueled speculation that Mr. Trump was already looking past November.So that’s what this may all be about. Of course, there are crazier theories still!Theory #4: Donald Trump’s presidential bid was cleverly engineered as a Clinton master plan to destroy her conventional GOP opponents and win her the White House.As we have previously noted, a lot of people are of the mind that Donald Trump is now actively trying to lose the election. The popular version of this theory holds that he’s doing so simply because he never meant to get as far down the road to the White House as he has, and he’s desperate for some sort of off-ramp.But there’s another version of the “Trump is trying to lose the election” theory, and that’s the “Trump is trying to throw the election to Hillary Clinton, because that was the plan that he and the Clintons dreamed up in the first place” theory.The Hill’s Brent Budowsky summarized the elements of that suspicion: The Trumps and the Clintons have a long history of mutual support ― including a past in which Trump praised both Clintons, funded their campaigns and gave some boodle to the Clinton Foundation. It has been put out that Donald and Bill had a lengthy and cordial discussion back in 2005 ― after which Trump suddenly jumped into the GOP primary field to presumably execute what Gawker’s J.K. Trotter called a “false flag” campaign, replete with positions on issues that Trump had never previously expressed.Surely this notion is nuts, right? As Peter Weber wrote in The Week:There has been mostly-in-jest murmuring since Trump took his escalator ride down to political stardom last year that he is a plant for Hillary Clinton, perhaps persuaded to run by Bill Clinton to torpedo the Republican Party. It’s a preposterous conspiracy theory, especially ridiculous because either the Republican electorate would have to be in on the prank or oblivious to Trump’s repeated attempts to disqualify himself.“And yet,” Weber wrote, “here we are.” Could it be? Suspicious conservatives have rather famously retweeted one man’s take on the matter into a popular refrain: But what if Hillary Clinton is not Trump’s co-conspirator?Theory #5: Donald Trump is the unwitting agent of a Russian plot to deform American political norms and destabilize our democratic institutions.Finally, we come to the most incendiary ― and let’s face it cockamamie ― theory of them all: Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin are, on some level, authoritarian cuddle-buddies. Perhaps Putin simply recognizes the way Trump has destroyed America’s political norms, and he wants to exacerbate this dynamic. But maybe, more darkly, the two man are in cahoots in an effort to actively assist Putin’s regional ambitions! What’s that in the mirror? Or the corner of your eye? What’s that footstep following, but never passing by?The public fascination with Trump’s potential connections to Putin has found a home in respectable circles. As New York Magazine’s Jonathan Chait wrote back in July:Donald Trump is not a Russian agent in the sense that Philip and Elizabeth from The Americans are Russian agents. There’s no hidden radio in his laundry room where he transmits secrets to the Kremlin. But his relationship with Russia is disturbing and lends itself to frightening interpretations.What gives this theory its lift is the same thing that now may presage its decline ― the influence of dictator-curious Paul Manafort on the Trump campaign. Manafort, as of this week, is presumably much less influential, having resigned his campaign post.There’s no denying that while Putin’s Ukraine-fixer was atop the Trump operation, things got fixed in ways favorable to Putin. During Manafort’s tenure, Trump made NATO skepticism a recurring theme in his campaign speeches. He frequently spoke about how great it would be to be on friendly terms with Putin’s regime. At one point, he even importuned Russia’s state-sponsored cyber spies to intercede on his behalf. And during the convention, the GOP platform’s language on Ukraine ― which had called for aggressively supporting the anti-Putin forces in that country ― was watered down considerably.That Manafort departed the Trump campaign the same week that he became embroiled in a Ukraine-related lobbying scandal is a combination of events that fuels these suspicions while also suggesting this theory’s time in the sun may be coming to an end. But who knows? Those who have watched the Trump campaign’s odd flirtations might still point out that Manafort’s deputy, Carter Page, remains with the campaign and as curiously connected to Putin as ever. Furthermore, it’s worth noting that the Clinton campaign continues to aggressively push this conspiracy as a convenient, self-serving distraction from their candidate’s own ties to foreign powers.So maybe the notion that Trump and Putin are all twined with one another will persist in the background of this election. Perhaps it will fade from view, replaced by some newer, crazier theory. It’s also possible that we all have to revise our standards for what constitutes a “crazy theory” in the first place.One day, maybe we will learn what intentions and ambitions drove Donald Trump to run for president in the first place. Perhaps whatever this coming “pivot” is will helpfully reveal that truth.But if I had to wager, I’d say that in all likelihood we’re just going to end up sucker-punched by some weird twist we never saw coming.

35,POLITICS,Trump Ally Roger Stone Says GOP Nominee Should Release Tax Returns 'Immediately',Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/roger-stone-trump-tax-returns_us_57bb4ccee4b0b51733a50396,Trump and his campaign have offered myriad excuses for not making the records available to the public.,2016-08-22,Trump's supporters are joining the calls for him to release his tax returns. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57bb54a71700001108c74bd5.jpeg?cache=XqPXYK7HHL&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Roger Stone, a longtime Republican political operative and current ally of Donald Trump, on Monday said the GOP nominee should release his tax returns right away.“Yes, I think he should release his tax returns immediately,” Stone said in a radio interview with the “Fernand Amandi Show,” according to BuzzFeed News, when asked if Trump was making a mistake by not doing so.Trump and his campaign have offered myriad excuses for not making the records available to the public ― a tradition followed by major party nominees for decades.The businessman has repeatedly cited an ongoing audit by the Internal Revenue Service as a reason as to why he couldn’t release the returns. The IRS, however, has said individuals are not prohibited from sharing tax information while being audited. President Richard Nixon released his tax returns during an audit. Moreover, there is nothing stopping Trump from releasing previous returns for years not currently under audit.Over the weekend, newly minted Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Trump would not release his tax returns until the IRS audit is complete, despite previously calling on him to make the information available while working for a super PAC supporting Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R).Back in May, former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski also claimed there was “nothing to learn” from the tax returns. The opposition to the release of the records was maintained by his successor, Paul Manafort, who was pushed out of the campaign last week amid revelations he secretly lobbied on behalf of Ukraine’s pro-Russian government in 2014. Stone isn’t the first Trump supporter to call on the GOP nominee to release his tax returns. Earlier this month, Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) wrote a Sunday New York Times op-ed titled “I Support You, Donald Trump. Now Release Your Tax Returns.” The congressman noted his continued ability to support Trump will “in part be driven by whether Mr. Trump keeps his word that he will release his tax records.”But the break in messaging is somewhat surprising for Stone, a longtime friend of Trump who quit his campaign last summer. The hard-nosed GOP operative regularly peddles conspiracy theories about Hillary and Bill Clinton. He previously “confirmed” that Cruz’s father was involved in the Kennedy assassination, and called for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (I) to be shot for treason.Clinton’s campaign began airing a new ad last week attacking Trump for not releasing his tax returns despite saying in 2014 he “absolutely” would do so. She and her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, also released their returns in an effort to pressure their Republican opponent to do the same.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
36,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: Democrats Have A Solid Chance Of Retaking The Senate,Natalie Jackson and Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/democrats-retaking-the-senate_us_57bae67ee4b0b51733a45376,HuffPost’s poll-based model indicates Senate Republicans could be in trouble.,2016-08-22,Just 11% of Trump backers are very confident in accurate vote count in U.S.,http://www.pewresearch.org/files/2016/08/Politics_FT.png,"Current Senate polls indicate Republicans are likely to lose control of the chamber. Donald Trump’s ceiling of support may be getting lower. And only about half of voters are very confident that their votes will be counted correctly. This is HuffPollster for Monday, August 22, 2016.THINGS AREN’T LOOKING GREAT FOR REPUBLICANS IN THE SENATE - HuffPollster: “The biggest electoral question of the year is undoubtedly who becomes the next president. But just after that follows the issue of whether the Senate majority will flip again. Republicans took the chamber with a 54-46 seat majority in the 2014 midterm elections. Keeping that lead in 2016, however, will prove a more difficult task. According to The Huffington Post’s Senate model, which relies on the polls aggregated in HuffPost Pollster charts, there’s a 55 percent chance that the Senate will swing completely over ― and a 23 percent chance that it’s tied at 50 seats for each party. That means there’s a 78 percent chance that the Democratic Party could get 50 or more seats.” [HuffPost]Some caveats - More from HuffPollster: “First, this model does not project out to Election Day. These figures are based on what polling and Cook Political Report ratings say about the races now.... There’s one big reason for focusing the model on what we know now: Events that would substantially shake up the races are generally unpredictable. Poll numbers will wax and wane, and this model accounts for that. What it can’t account for (and no model can) is a big change in circumstances that would alter the election such as occurred in 2008 when the economy crashed in mid-September. All the model really does is say what is most likely given the current trajectory.” [HuffPost]We’ll provide updates for the model in this newsletter. HALF OF VOTERS SAY THEY WOULDN’T EVER VOTE FOR TRUMP - Cameron Easley and Eli Yokley: “A new Morning Consult survey testing the ceiling of support for the presidential candidates suggests it’s an uphill climb for the GOP nominee: Trump has crossed the 50 percent threshold, but in the wrong direction. In a new poll this week, half of all voters said they would definitely not consider voting for Trump, while 45 percent of respondents said they definitely wouldn’t consider voting for Clinton….But, the GOP nominee can take solace in some of the other numbers on candidates’ ceilings: Clinton seems more likely to lose votes to the other candidates in the race. While 28 percent of Clinton and Trump supporters say they would consider voting for Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson, a former Republican governor of New Mexico, more than a quarter (27 percent) of those currently planning on voting for Clinton said they’d consider backing Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Only 14 percent of Trump supporters say they would consider voting for Stein.” [Morning Consult]MANY REPUBLICANS THINK TRUMP’S CAMPAIGN IS BADLY RUN - William Jordan: “Even before the week’s campaign shake-up, 66% of Americans said his campaign was ‘poorly managed’. Only 22% say the campaign is ‘well run’. Even many Republicans are having doubts. Meanwhile 55% say Clinton is running her campaign well. There are obvious disadvantages to running a campaign badly, including difficulties getting a message out before election day and getting the vote out on election day. But substandard campaign management can also reflect poorly on the campaign itself, creating a vicious cycle. In fact 39% of registered voters say a presidential candidate’s ability to manage his or her campaign affects how they view that candidate ‘a great deal’, while another 41% say it affects their view at least a ‘moderate amount’.” [YouGov]VOTERS EXPRESS SKEPTICISM ABOUT THE ELECTORAL PROCESS - Hannah Fingerhut: “In a campaign marked by skepticism toward the political process, only about half of all registered voters (49%) are ‘very confident’ that their vote will be accurately counted in the upcoming election....Pew Research Center’s new national political survey finds that just 38% of registered voters who support Trump are very confident their vote will be accurately counted. Another 31% say they are somewhat confident, while 30% have little or no confidence their vote will be counted accurately. Among Clinton supporters, 67% have a high degree of confidence that their vote will be counted accurately and 25% are somewhat confident. Just 7% have little or no confidence.” [Pew Research]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!
