Mathew Knowles Says Beyonce, Jay Z Divorce Talk Is 'Jedi Mind Trick'",Cavan Sieczkowski,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mathew-knowles-beyonce-jay-z-divorce_n_5728904.html,,2014-08-28,"INGLEWOOD, CA - AUGUST 24: (L-R) Blue Ivy Carter, recording artists Jay Z and Beyonce speak onstage during the 2014 MTV Video Music Awards at The Forum on August 24, 2014 in Inglewood, California.

The latter is apparently the case when it comes to the Beyonce and Jay Z divorce talk, according to Beyonce's father Mathew Knowles. Knowles made the whole Beyonce and Jay Z saga a lot more puzzling during an interview on ""The Roula & Ryan Show"" on Houston's 104.1 KREB. A discussion arose about fame and dealing with scrutiny in the public eye. Host Roula Christie asked how to deal with issues like the elevator incident between Jay Z and Solange or the current divorce talk surrounding the power couple. ""You know, I know -- because we've done this, from experience -- there's a tour going on,"" Knowles said, seemingly referencing Jay and Bey's On the Run tour. ""So you have to sometimes ignite that tour. It's called a Jedi mind trick. And the Jedi mind trick fools you a lot of times. So things you see sometimes are [poof] ... All I know is the Jedi mind trick. Everybody's talking about it. Ticket sales went up. Solange's album sales went up 200 percent.""Umm ... Okay? We must admit that while some in the entertainment business need to use rumors to drum up publicity, it seems as if Beyonce and Jay Z's combined super-stardom doesn't necessitate such a tactic for success. But, hey, anything's possible in showbiz! Mathew Knowles' comments come on the heels of Beyonce's MTV Video Music Awards performance. After Beyonce crushed her 17-minute set, Jay Z and Blue Ivy joined her on stage to present her with the coveted Vanguard Award. The rapper called her the ""greatest living entertainer."" The ""XO"" singer, in turn, called him ""my beloved"" during her thank-you speech. Listen to Mathew Knowles' full interview on ""The Roula & Ryan Show"":"
1,WOMEN,This Is What An Athlete Looks Like,"Louise Green, ContributorFounder, Body Exchange",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fit-and-fat-what-an-athlete-looks-like_b_5678917.html,"I don't blame the young man for taking the visual cue of my body and neatly categorizing me with the 5k'ers (which is also a very respectable distance, by the way). Why would he believe that my plus-size body is capable of 21 long kilometres when there aren't any visual cues presented in society to tell us this is possible?",2014-08-28,2014-08-14-7dd8f18006be11e482c15f33b2a0424e_princebodyissue.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-08-14-7dd8f18006be11e482c15f33b2a0424e_princebodyissue-thumb.jpg,"It's race day and after flying from Vancouver to San Francisco to run my first half marathon, I am already tired from the anticipation. I get up at 6:00 a.m., brush my teeth and, with insane nervousness, lace up my shoes. I hail a cab to Golden Gate Park where they are hosting the 30th anniversary 5K and Half Marathon Race. When I arrive, I feel the excitement immediately; there is a buzz of race anticipation coming from the crowd; loud talking and laughter as thousands of people move towards the big archway that marks the start and gateway to what will be one the most physically challenging days of my life. A calm comes over me and the little voice inside my head says on repeat: ""You can do this, you can do this."" I start buying it.I inch closer, towards the long rows of tables bustling with volunteers and runners. I find a young man behind the table who's handing out race packages. It's this moment that may seem subtle but speaks volumes about where our societal compass sits when it comes to the perception of larger bodies and fitness.I give him my name and he repeats it under his breath. He looks up at me, and instantly reaches for the 5km race packages, making the assumption, without asking, that I am participating in the shorter distance. The representation of my body size communicates to him an unspoken message that I am not physically capable of running the event's longer distance. If this were an isolated incident this article wouldn't exist; however, it happens at every event I am apart of, and that others like me participate in. It might be an out of line comment, a surprised reaction or the articulation of an assumption about what my body is capable of. More commonly comes the perplexed look of confusion when I tell people I am a personal trainer and I own a fitness business. The well intentioned ""good for you"" calls echoing from the sidelines in a tone championing a toddler in potty training, further stand to signify that people consider my participation an anomaly.I correct this young man immediately. ""I am here to run the half marathon,"" I say sharply. With surprise and embarrassment he says, ""Oh"" and quickly fumbles for my race package in the other box. I take my number and the event branded race shirt that is three sizes too small, and walk over to my husband and stand off to the side. My excitement and the little voice cheering me on have dissipated. We stand silently waiting for the race to begin. I can't help feeling defeated in that moment -- like an impostor or someone who didn't just train for months and for hundreds of miles. I try to remain positive, as I know this is an integral part of a successful race. Truthfully, I don't blame the young man for taking the visual cue of my body and neatly categorizing me with the 5k'ers (which is also a very respectable distance, by the way). Why would he believe that my plus-size body is capable of 21 long kilometres when there aren't any visual cues presented in society to tell us this is possible?There are no plus size athletes adorning the glossy pages of magazines, very few fitness books speak on this subject, and in movies fat people are commonly portrayed as dorky and comedic, not strong and capable. Seldom in advertising do we see products and services aligning themselves with body diversity. In fact, the only visual cues we receive that include plus-size representation in workout gear are generally the ""before"" pictures in weight loss or gym advertising. Despite study upon study demonstrating that fit can also be fat, most of society can't see past the media cues that are put in front of us by advertisers. As a result, athletes who fall outside of the athletic ""norm"" take the brunt of society's assumptions when attending races and working out in gyms. In spite of this, we continue to participate and pioneer a change in public perception. Triathlete Wendy Welsher has felt the judgment too. ""It's always intimidating walking into mainstream gyms as a plus-size girl. Everything changed for me after I found my personal trainer, Rossanna. She has pushed me to be an athlete and has only looked at me for my potential, not my size. She has then encouraged me to become a personal trainer so I can now help girls like me."" It was when Wendy finally found the appropriate support that her athleticism excelled.  Cyclist and Runner, Natalie Dzepina, also recalls people pointing at her and laughing during races: ""I was called ""Fatso"" a few times. I think seeing a fat chick running makes people uncomfortable. Like her place should be on a sofa with a bag of chips. It's never bothered me as long as I'm out running.""While these experiences of judgment and discrimination are disappointing, the moral of this story isn't to be a victim, but to raise awareness around size diversity in athleticism. You see, judgment is rampant and this creates insurmountable barriers for the plus-size population who live in a diet culture of ""move more, eat less"" advice every time they see their physician, turn on the TV or read a magazine. Many of these individuals want to be active, but can't face the vulnerability of putting themselves out there to be judged. When we talk about a health crisis in North America, this is it. It is not ""obesity"" but how we respond to it.  Krista Henderson is a seasoned triathlete and writer of the popular blog dedicated to plus size athleticism, ""Born to Reign.""  (Photo Credit: Mike Cheliak)She writes, ""Healthy and unhealthy bodies comes in all shapes and sizes. It's unfortunate the media has created such an unrealistic image of what health looks like, with sculpted bodies and 6-pack abs. The fitness industry is so heavily influenced by the beauty culture.""While many people assume that fat automatically equals unfit there's a growing number of highly respected researchers and agencies that say otherwise.Steven Blair is a renowned exercise researcher at the Arnold School of Public Health at the University of South Carolina. His research shows that excess weight is not ""the enemy."" Not getting enough exercise and being cardiovascular unfit are much greater contributors to poor health than any extra poundage can be. Blair stands firmly by his research that fit, fat people outlive thin, unfit people.In 2012, The National Cancer Institute also backed this by reporting that physical activity is ""associated with greater longevity among persons in all BMI groups: those normal weight, overweight, and obese.""Another study, published in the European Heart Journal, showed that when obese people are metabolically healthy -- with healthy blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar -- they are at no greater risk of dying from heart disease or cancer than those who are of normal weight.Despite the research and increasing numbers of plus-size athletes lacing up we still see judgment and discrimination even for athletes at an elite level.In the media, emerging stories on plus-size professional athleticism spark a body image controversy. Eighteen-year-old tennis player Taylor Townsend caused a media wave when she beat 21st ranked Alize Cornet and advanced to the third round in the French Open. She is the youngest U.S. female to advance to that level. Yet, three years earlier, in spite of her rising success, the U.S. Tennis Association tried to keep her out of competition at the U.S. Open. It was reported that until she lost weight, they would not support her.She is not alone.Recently, Yahoo Shine published an article about Major League Baseball pro Prince Fielder and the cover he did for ESPN, featuring his naked, powerful, body.  If you are not familiar with Fielder he has played baseball in the Major Leagues since 2002. He is a five-time All-Star, positioning himself as an elitist among the elite. Yet, to my disappointment the article's headline read: ""This Male Athlete Is Getting Fat-Shamed.""This negative exposure is disheartening. As I, and other plus-sized athletes like me, continue to suit up and show up at races and in the gyms, we must look around and ask why others don't? If elite athletes are the subjects of public-scrutiny despite highly ranking athletic achievement, then what message does that give to the novice who sits on the sidelines hoping to be active one day? People are fearful of fitness and rightly so.We can't harp on people to move their bodies when we live in a society that shames and judges us for our attempts.That day in Golden Gate Park I ran my heart out. I ran for 2 hours and 51 minutes. I pushed myself towards the finish line elated in tears that I was going to make it. I wanted to quit but I knew my husband, my biggest supporter, was waiting for me at the finish line. I often think to myself, what if everyone had this kind of support from loved ones or just as importantly from strangers? I've gone on to run and cycle many more long distance races and I never care what people think, anymore. I want to be in the game and inspire others to live their athletic dreams.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly.We are athletes daring greatly to change the landscape of the athleticism for everyone, if society will step back, ponder this article, and give us a chance.ALSO ON HUFFPOST:"

Colby Dolly and Charles Mayo talk while waiting out a thunderstorm during a protest of the shooting of Michael Brown Wednesday, Aug. 20, 2014, in Ferguson, Mo. Brown's shooting in the middle of a street Aug 9, by a Ferguson policeman has sparked more than week of protests, riots and looting in the St. Louis suburb. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badfec1240000310054cf55.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Any person who does not understand the fury and pain present within the African American community related to injustices enacted by some police need only to look to Forney, Texas, a small town located 20 miles east of Dallas. One late August evening, Kametra Barbour, along with her two children and two godchildren -- all under the age of 10 -- were driving through town. Suddenly, their nightmare began!Ms. Barbour was pulled over by Forney police officers who exited their vehicles with guns drawn. Each passenger was ordered to place their hands out the windows. Ms. Barbour was then ordered to exit her vehicle and to walk backwards, her hands lifted above her head. As she was being handcuffed, she cried aloud, and in distress, ""What is going on? Oh my God, you will terrify my kids!""An officer responded, ""We got a complaint of a vehicle matching your description and your license plate, waving a gun out the window."" Only they had not.Several moments before, a call was placed to 911. The operator was informed that four black men in a beige or tan-colored Toyota were speeding down the highway, the driver with a gun in his hand. Soon after, another call informed that the car was exiting the freeway. As she drove, Ms. Barbour happened upon that same exit. Instead of stopping a vehicle matching the description from the 911 call, officers took creative license in their interpretation of the details. The beige or tan-colored Toyota creatively became a burgundy red Nissan Maxima. A male driver was creatively exchanged for a female driver. Four passengers creatively became five, and many of those passengers creatively transformed into children from adults. The small matter of the license plate number not matching became part of their creative ingenuity. A dashboard camera in the police cruiser captured this unfortunate incident in its entirety. Had it not, it might be easily dismissed by those who refuse to recognize that such atrocities occur with regularity, negatively impacting the trust of the African American community.Unbelievably, an even greater offense has been committed against the Barbour family. The Forney police department has rejected any admission of error in stopping Ms. Barbour, and they have not fully acknowledged the terror their actions caused this young family.Or was it an error? Could it be that any Negro would do? Could it be that, in a nation that has legalized racial profiling through such policies as ""stop-and-frisk,"" the persecution of pigmentation makes African Americans indistinguishable from each other in the eyes of the law -- so much so that all are feared as imminent threats? How else can one explain how officers could be so  incredibly wrong about such a clear description? Could it be that they saw a black driver on a dark highway, and that was enough?Three years ago, while driving under the speed limit in Dallas with my uncle, one of my best friends from college, and my then-4-year-old son, officers pulled up alongside me, then quickly, behind me, lights flashing. I pulled over. As police approached on both sides, flashlights beamed into our vehicle. When an officer approached my window, he asked me a peculiar question: ""What do you do?"" The inquiry caught me off guard. I responded, ""I'm a pastor."" Suddenly, it all became clear. I was driving my wife's vehicle. A practicing attorney, the back of her vehicle still donned a law school decal. The officers saw three black men in a vehicle bearing a law school decal and knew that the car must have been stolen. Each adult male in that vehicle that evening had earned a graduate degree or had completed graduate hours. One was in the process of completing a dissertation. However, no level of success or achievement has ever insulated the African American community from such disturbing encounters. Not that success or achievement should matter, as all people deserve to be treated with dignity and with equality under the law. Unfortunately, on any given day, any Negro will do!Our saving grace that evening was that two attorneys, my wife and another college friend, were trailing us. I shudder to think of what could have happened to us had those women not been present. I shudder to think what could have happened if the car Forney police pulled over had been occupied by one black man, or three black men, or even five black men as passengers. What could have been their fate?It is a historic and tragic remembrance that many innocent black men and boys were lynched by lynch mobs after an accusation of rape made by a white woman. Whether or not the rape actually occurred was inconsequential. Lynch mobs were known to apprehend, brutalize, and then hang the very first black man that they encountered. Any Negro blood would satisfy their blood-thirstiness. In some cases, the lynch mob would grow to become a rioting mob leaving dozens of blacks killed and whole neighborhoods destroyed.During the Forney stop, Ms. Barbour's young son exited the vehicle with his hands raised above his head and inquired, ""Are we going to jail?"" I weep knowing that even as a young African American child, with hands raised, that child could have been fatally engaged by police as a threat.Four decades ago, the late, great Marvin Gaye inquired through lyric, as Ms. Barbour did that August night, ""What's going on?""The answer that we have awaited for so many years may have long been under our noses. When it comes to explaining certain brutalities, any Negro will do."

I look forward to a great evening and I'm thankful to U.S. Soccer for making this happen.""News of Donovan's national team swan song comes less than a month after he announced his plan to retire from soccer at the end of the current MLS season. That announcement has been followed by an excellent run of form for the 32-year-old legend, who recently earned MVP honors in the 2014 MLS All-Star Game after scoring the winning goal to beat Bayern Munich.Donovan was controversially left off the U.S. World Cup team in May, with head coach Jurgen Klinsmann passing on bringing the three-time World Cup veteran and scorer of five World Cup goals. Donovan was critical of Klinsmann's decision to leave him off the World Cup team and also criticized Klinsmann's handling of the U.S. team in Brazil.The midfielder's farewell will come in first match on home soil for the U.S. team since the World Cup, which saw the Stars and Stripes advance out of a very difficult group before losing to Belgium in the round of 16.Donovan's finale will come almost 14 years after making his national team debut on Oct. 25, 2000, in a 2-0 win against Mexico.“For 15 years, Landon has thrilled us with his amazing abilities on the field and impressed us with his gracious approach off the field,” said U.S. Soccer President Sunil Gulati. “We are looking forward to celebrating his legacy during our next home National Team match and allowing fans the opportunity to thank him for all the memories he’s provided over the years.”"

Many now understand poverty to be a structural sin and a social evil. Through your public statements you have sparked the interest of Catholics and non-Catholics, believers and atheists. The world looks to you as a shepherd, a man filled with the joy of the Gospel.Yet, while you have focused on physical and material poverty, members of my community -- lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and transgender and queer/questioning men, women and youth -- have been neglected. They remain on the frontiers, the margins, living spiritually poor lives. Some need the voice of cardinals like Walter Kasper to tell them that God loves them. Others know that God loves them, but church leadership rejects them as disordered and disoriented. Your prophetic question ""Who am I to judge?"" encourages people everywhere to have a nonjudgmental attitude toward members of the LGBTQ community, but being nonjudgmental is not enough, especially when Jesus tells us to be like the Good Samaritan and ""go, do likewise.""But who am I to write you?As an openly gay man, I've spent the past 10 years pursuing the priesthood in the Society of Jesus (the Jesuits). I am full of gratitude for this time. I loved being a Jesuit, a son of St. Ignatius of Loyola. This July I left the Jesuits in good standing.Today I can no longer justly or freely pursue ordination to the priesthood as a gay man in a church where gay men and lesbian women are being fired from their jobs. The last straw for me was when a married lesbian social-justice minister was fired from a Jesuit parish in Kansas City. Such marginalization is contrary to what many have called the ""Francis effect."" These firings negate your emphasis on eradicating poverty because the firings bring men and women closer to physical and material poverty. Firing people because of their sexuality or their right to marry is discriminatory. It is unjust, especially since many Catholic institutions have employment-nondiscrimination disclaimers that state that they are equal-opportunity employers that comply with all federal, state, and local laws that prohibit discrimination in employment based on race, color, national origin, age, gender, religion, disability, marital status, sexual orientation, veteran status, and arrest record.In my decision letter to my provincial, I noted my awareness of how LGBTQ injustice contradicts the Gospel. Furthermore, I pointed out how anti-gay legislation in countries like Uganda and Russia, and the subsequent lack of action by the church, led me to start questioning my membership in the church. As I pray about why I left the Society of Jesus, because of LGBTQ injustice in the church, I continue to pray St. Ignatius' Suscipe Prayer:Take, Lord, and receive all my liberty, my memory, my understanding, and my entire will, all I have and call my own. You have given all to me. To you, Lord, I return it. Everything is yours; do with it what you will. Give me only your love and your grace; that is enough for me.Pope Francis.Pope Francis.I pray that God continues to give me the grace to fulfill my vows, to respond to the needs of our world, an Incarnated reality that needs an ecumenical church -- one that responds to the needs of the physically and spiritually poor together, as evidenced by Matthew 25. I long to not be a safe outsider or a fringe character. Yet I, an openly gay man, was told by my superiors to focus on other pastoral concerns. Why?As an openly gay man, I sought ordination because of God's calling me to the priesthood. From the age of 15, I prayed to understand that question. I prayed not to run but to be found. Time and again vocation directors, spiritual directors, and superiors tested my deepest desires, my holiest longing; these men saw me as oriented, not disordered, available to the priesthood for good and holy reasons.As I entered the Jesuit novitiate, God helped me know myself and see myself as a fully self-loving and integrated gay man. Over time I saw that I had gifts to offer as a sensitive, empathic, joyful, loving, prayerful, articulate, multidimensional, well-educated minister. I understand myself to be priestly despite my humanness and frailty.Pope Francis, with my vocation evolving, I remain priestly. I write you to help save my vocation, whatever that might be in the future. I ask you to instruct the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops to tell Catholic institutions not to fire any more LGBTQ Catholics. I ask you to speak out against laws that criminalize and oppress LGBTQ people around the globe. These actions would bring true life to your statement ""Whom am I to judge?""As I continue my transition as a member of the laity, I am reminded that, like every Jesuit, I am ""a sinner yet called to be a companion of Jesus as our founder Saint Ignatius of Loyola was."" And like many of my Jesuit brothers worldwide, gay or straight, I still reflect on the three principal questions of Jesuit and Ignatian prayer: What have I done for Jesus? What am I doing for Jesus? And what will I do for Jesus? For this I am full of gratitude.As a former Jesuit, I know that at the core of Saint Ignatius' Spiritual Exercises is a meeting of God, others, and self. This meeting takes place in a dynamic way that draws on our human and godly desires for relationship and love. In short, it is a pilgrimage that places Jesus at the center of one's life. This pilgrimage is open to gay and straight believers. Jesus instructed us all to be good Samaritans, to ""go, do likewise.""With love and affection, Ben BrenkertThis post originally appeared on Bondings 2.0, the blog of New Ways Ministry.See also: ""Priestly, but no longer a candidate for priesthood"""

That's why I was over the moon recently when I had the great fortune to stay at a hotel that was the inspiration for the 1932 film ""Grand Hotel."" The movie won Best Picture that year, and the lavish sets designed by the great Cedric Gibbons perfectly depicted a Five Star hotel in all its grandeur.   The place that inspired MGM and Gibbons is the Hotel Adlon Kempinski in Berlin. In fact, many scenes including the one where Greta Garbo utters her famous phrase, ""I want to be alone,"" were filmed on the property. I couldn't wait to arrive, and when the time came to depart, I found it difficult to leave. It was lavish yet unpretentious and refined yet comfortable. In short, it was heaven. Entering the lobby at the Hotel Adlon Kempinski  Fresh flowers in the room and other touches made this hotel feel very special I'm always amazed by people who say they don't care about their accommodations when they plan a vacation. For me, a home away from home is what good travel is all about, and a wonderful place to hang my hat is the baseline of my happy trip somewhere. Given that criteria, the Adlon experience left me positively gleeful. Of course, being a designer and antiques dealer, I am always interested in the marriage of comfort and luxury. I'm also impressed with good design and the historical importance of a location. The Adlon offers all of these things and more.  Outside of The Hotel Adlon KempinskiA Palace Fit For a King Built in 1907, the Adlon is credited as the first hotel to see beyond standard accommodations to fostering a fashionable meeting place environment. Its first guest was Emperor Wilhelm II, and other luminaries soon followed, from Albert Einstein to Charlie Chaplin to Teddy Roosevelt. Like most buildings in Berlin, the Adlon was largely destroyed in WWII. In 1997, however, it was re-built and its original grandeur was restored. Painstaking efforts were taken to re-capture all of the detail, and it shows. The rooms are generous and beautifully appointed, the dining areas are warm and lush, and the lobby is right out of a 1930s movie. The concierge service is perfection and little details like complimentary shoe shines are ways the Adlon makes guests feel pampered. Just leave your shoes outside the room at night, and by morning they are back, perfectly shined.  View of The Brandenberg Gate from The Hotel Adlon Kempinski  Location, Location, LocationOne of the Adlon's many virtues is its location adjacent to the Brandenberg Gate, which many regard as the most famous structure in Berlin. There's an idyllic view from many rooms, including the second-floor dining salon. The former city gate, this impressive neoclassical arch is an important piece of Berlin's history. Completed in 1791, the gate was badly damaged in WWII and then isolated next to the Berlin Wall. A decade after the wall came down, the Brandenberg Gate was restored to its original beauty. As I walked through it everyday I thought about all of the war and strife the gate has seen, and there it stands, now considered a symbol of European unity.Speaking of unity, just steps away from the gate is the Riechstag Building, which is where Germany's reunification ceremony was held in 1990. Like all of the other buildings I've mentioned, it also has a complicated past and interesting present. It was largely destroyed in WWII and fell into greater disrepair until the reunification. After that, it underwent about a decade of reconstruction. A view of the Berlin Radio Tower from atop the Riechstag Building Inside the glass dome of the Reichstag BuildingNow one of the top attractions in Germany, the restored classical building has a very modern glass dome in its center. Tourists line up to ride the elevator to the top, where the views of Berlin are pretty breathtaking. War RememberedIt's impossible to visit Berlin and not be reminded of war. It seems this is not only unavoidable, but also very intentional. Also in the direct vicinity of the hotel is the monument to the Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. Completed in 2004, the brutalist structure takes up an entire city block and serves as an architectural metaphor for the horrors that befell Jewish people during WWII. Inside the somber building are hundreds and hundreds of photos and letters revealing the atrocities of the concentration camps. Also in the vicinity are many remnants of The Berlin Wall, and tourists line up to take photos with one foot on either side of where the wall once stood. Also in this area are many buildings half-destroyed by WWII, now restored with new architectural elements like steel and Plexiglas. While I'm usually an architectural purist, I felt these restored buildings symbolized a city that did not want to forget, and at the same time, had emerged stronger, more transparent, and ready to move ahead.  A restaurant, largely destroyed in WWII, now preserved behind PlexiglasStrolling throughout Berlin, bullet holes pepper every pre-WWII building and statue. Some have been restored and some have not, but all bear the mark of war. The museums, too, are reminder of Germany's tumultuous history. My favorite was the German Historical Museum, which included many artifacts from The Third Reich, and paints a very grim portrait of Hitler.  Sheet music for the popular wartime song, Lili Marlene, displayed at the German Historical MuseumAnother favorite stop of mine was the iconic Checkpoint Charlie outpost I recall from spy movies. Also known as ""Checkpoint C,"" this Cold War remnant marks the crossing point between East Berlin and West Berlin. While the wall is long gone, this is, in some ways, like a Civil War reenactment in the U.S. The signage remains, and military personnel 'stand guard,' but it is really a 3-D historical marker. The soldiers also really seem to enjoy posing for pictures with tourists.  Sign at Checkpoint Charlie outpost Outside Checkpoint Charlie gateThe Flea Market Capital of Europe Perusing the Tiergarten Flea MarketYou don't need to know much about me to understand that when I discovered Berlin had over 40 flea markets, I was sold on a trip there. No matter where I go, a flea market is always on the itinerary. My ideal souvenirs are ones that are at least 70 years old, and have had a few other lives before winding up in my hands. Because time was limited and I wanted to hit the best flea markets possible, I talked with the concierge at the hotel who helped me find a few that were large, authentic and the most visited by locals. I always say if you want to understand a place and its people, go to a flea market. My favorite was the Tiergarten Market in Central Berlin, also known as the ""Original Berlin Flea Market."" It was bustling with vendors and shoppers and had lots of items that were calling my name. While I've been known to shop European markets with reckless abandon, I didn't want to ship items home on this trip, so I passed on some larger items like lighting and furniture. Believe, me, it took a lot of willpower. There's one lamp that is still haunting me.... A vintage candy tin I brought home as a souvenirOnce I'd made the decision to buy small, I chose a few tins and some ephemeral finds. I often pick these things up at a flea market abroad because they are easy to pack and I can always find a place for them when I get home. One tin is a candy container from the 1920s and the other is a tobacco case from the 1950s. Each has fantastic color and design. I can store odd and ends in them, and they look great sitting just about anywhere. In addition to enjoying the merchandise, I was quickly charmed by the people. No matter where I go, I find flea market folks have a universal language. We love 'stuff' and we tend to bond over it. Even though I don't speak German, I was able to haggle, and get very nice prices---as well as making a few new friends. Enjoying a Beautiful Day in Tiergarten Park Tiergarten Park, which is lovely and lush, runs along the center of Berlin, and after the market, we walked inside for a while and enjoyed a stroll, which led us to a traditional German Beer Garden. The crowd was enjoying good music and good weather, and it was fun to be among them. We also had a hearty and delicious brunch after working up an appetite traversing the flea market. From the hotel to the tourist attractions to the time spent with locals, Berlin was one of the best trips I've had to date. The city is fascinating (and immaculately clean!); the people are friendly; the food is delicious, and the whole place is easily navigable by foot, which is a huge plus for this New Yorker.

(Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafcc531f0000df00231a9c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A worried mother living in rural North Georgia recently called my office seeking legal advice. She divorced a few years back and got custody of her kids. Now, after learning that she is a lesbian and living with another woman, her ex-husband has filed a lawsuit seeking to take custody away from her. Sadly, I regularly receive calls like these at my Atlanta law practice. When making child custody determinations, some Georgia judges do not look fondly on a parent's cohabitating with a romantic interest outside wedlock. Add to that the parent's being gay or lesbian, and, as a lawyer, I have my work cut out for me. Moreover, in 2004, Georgia voters approved a state constitutional amendment prohibiting same-sex marriage. As I spoke to her, this mother was weeping as she explained her distress at Georgia's contradictory refusal to allow her to marry her partner while at the same time possibly taking her children away because she is not married.Despite the extraordinary gains made in recent years to stamp out the stigma attached to being LGBT, life for many gay Southerners (especially those living in rural areas) can still be very difficult. Our history has proven -- time and again -- that the most effective antidote to anti-gay bigotry is LGBT people coming out and putting a face on and giving a voice to our lives. But we can't do it alone; in order for life in Georgia and throughout the South to truly improve, we need our straight friends and political allies to similarly ""come out"" in their support of our equality.That is why I get ticked when politicians and political candidates purporting to support LGBT equality do things that actually harm us. Take, for example, the U.S. Senate candidacy of Georgia Democrat Michelle Nunn. Ms. Nunn is running in a competitive race for an open seat against Republican David Perdue. There is little doubt where Mr. Purdue stands on LGBT issues (strongly opposed), but there is a lot of doubt about where Ms. Nunn stands. And what to do about that is an issue Georgia's LGBT community is wrestling with today.There are some who say we should not press Ms. Nunn on our issues, especially marriage equality, because doing so will hurt her campaign, and we know that she will, at the very least, be better than the Republican.I strongly disagree. Ms. Nunn has actively reached out to the LGBT community for campaign cash and votes. In private, Ms. Nunn reportedly says that she supports LGBT issues and may even ""personally"" support marriage equality. Her campaign, however, has thus far been stone-cold silent on gay issues. There is no reference on either Ms. Nunn's campaign's website or Facebook page to any issue close to the gay community's heart (like ENDA), nor even a mention of Georgia's LGBT community. Ms. Nunn has repeatedly refused interview requests with gay media outlets. In fact, her only public LGBT issue position is that she believes same-sex marriage should be ""left to the states."" This aligns her with those supporting our state's marriage ban -- a despicable position for her to have because it gives credibility to the intolerance currently enshrined in Georgia's constitution. Ms. Nunn's silence and deference ""to the states"" stands in stark contrast with two other Georgia Democrats running for statewide office, Jason Carter (governor) and Greg Hecht (attorney general). Both Carter and Hecht have publicly said they support marriage equality without caveat. Ms. Nunn's campaign is viable because of Georgia's rapidly changing demographics, coupled with her family name. More than 1.5 million people have moved into Georgia since 2004, the state's population is now 45-percent minority, and many political pundits believe Georgia is trending toward purple. Ms. Nunn's father, Sam Nunn, served as a U.S. senator from Georgia from 1972 until 1997, and her campaign is aggressively invoking her father and his likeness. Their hope is that voters will see, in the daughter, ""enough of the father to take a chance,"" as one 62-year-old Army veteran told Time after revealing his plan to vote for a Democrat, Ms. Nunn, for the first time since he supported her father.For LGBT Georgians, however, the legacy of the elder Nunn is nothing to ""take a chance"" on. Sam Nunn was notoriously anti-LGBT. In the 1980s he fired two of his Senate staffers upon learning they were gay. He also infamously led the 1993 fight against allowing gays to serve in the military. The resulting ""don't ask, don't tell"" (DADT) law was intended to keep gay military personnel invisible and silent. If Ms. Nunn wants to run on her father's legacy, she has to embrace that entire legacy or explain how she is different -- something she has failed to do when it comes to LGBT issues. Instead, like her father before her, she is embracing a ""don't ask, don't tell"" approach to our community. This only perpetuates anti-gay stigma because it's easy to dislike those you do not know and cannot see.Thankfully, attitudes on LGBT issues are improving. For example, an Atlanta Journal Constitution poll taken last fall found that more Georgians now support same-sex marriage than oppose it.We are in a new era where supporting LGBT issues does not have the electoral implications it once did. The equality movement repealed DADT by telling stories of the service and sacrifice of our LGBT troops. In the several election cycles since that bipartisan vote, no one -- neither Republican nor Democrat -- has suffered at the polls as a result of supporting repeal. Can someone name one U.S. Senate or House race today where a candidate's position on LGBT issues is having an impact? I can't.If Ms. Nunn is running to lead the Georgia of the future and the state's evolving electorate, then leading on LGBT issues will help her make that case and become that candidate.The gay-marriage bans passed by Georgia and some other states have the same intent as DADT: to keep gays on the margins of society. Gay Southerners must stop allowing politicians who claim to be our friends to promulgate the silence and invisibility of LGBT people. We must ask, and we must insist, that they tell. As with the repeal of DADT, the resulting positive conversation will destroy stereotypes and stigma; it will promote and educate people about the truth of LGBT lives and families.Only then can I hope that my law office's phone will stop ringing with calls from frightened LGBT moms and dads living in constant fear of the prejudice that is allowed to fester by the silence of our political ""friends."""
9,POLITICS,Lawmakers Hear Voter Anger Over Undocumented Migrants In Town Halls,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/immigration-town-halls_n_5728134.html,,2014-08-28,"UNITED STATES - JULY 24: Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, speaks to the press after a Republican Conference meeting. The GOP members focused on measures they will take in the next few weeks to 'ease burdens on small businesses.' (Photo By Chris Maddaloni/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d3e72500008b013a53a3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Gabriel DebenedettiDALLAS, Aug 28 (Reuters) - When Republican Rep. Jeb Hensarling sat down with colleagues and constituents at a recent Chamber of Commerce lunch in Dallas, the first question he faced was whether Congress planned to address immigration policy and a burgeoning border crisis.""I'm supposed to do this in 30 seconds?"" he joked, noting the issue's complexity. While he was optimistic about long-term prospects for dealing with border security and immigration, he said, ""between now and the end of this Congress, I'm a little less sanguine about it.""It has been a question heard repeatedly by lawmakers this month in ""town hall"" district meetings punctuated - and sometimes dominated - by concerns and angry outbursts over immigration policy and the crisis caused by a flood of child migrants at the southwestern border in recent months.Those summer town halls have provided lawmakers a first-hand glimpse of growing discontent among Americans over U.S. immigration policy. Seventy percent of Americans - including 86 percent of Republicans - believe undocumented immigrants threaten traditional U.S. beliefs and customs, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted in mid-July. Those fears have been exacerbated by the recent wave of illegal child migrants from Central America. An issue that had been simmering is now hotting up as voters prepare to go to the polls in congressional elections due in November.The anger and frustration expressed in the town halls suggests there will be a fierce debate when U.S. lawmakers return to Washington on Sept. 8 and take up proposals to address a flood of child migrants crossing the southwestern U.S. border.While conservative anger has not approached the levels seen during the healthcare debate in August 2009, when town halls across the country were frequently disrupted, members of both parties have been confronted on the issue.From border states like Texas to less likely hot spots like Oregon, Colorado, and New York, Democratic and Republican lawmakers have heard a steady stream of questions and complaints from voters - most pushing for a crackdown on illegal immigration and some worried about what they see as Washington's inaction. ""ANGER IS PALPABLE""""I hear it everywhere I go,"" said Oregon Republican Greg Walden, who travels the country in his role as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee.""The anger is palpable,"" Hensarling, a six-term conservative congressman who is often identified by colleagues as a possible next Speaker of the House, told Reuters.Local media reported police were called to a meeting in Hollister, California hosted by Democratic Rep. Sam Farr after an audience member shouted at Farr and the crowd about the dangers posed by the child migrants.A town hall hosted by Democrat Jared Polis of Colorado featured constituents shouting at Polis and each other, and applauding those who contradicted him, on a range of issues, most prominently immigration, a local newspaper said""We've had seven town halls, and immigration is the number one issue that comes up,"" Polis told Reuters.A series of executive actions on immigration that President Barack Obama plans to unveil next month could further intensify the debate. The policy changes are likely to fuel Republican accusations that Obama is overstepping his authority. ""THERE'S A LOT OF FEAR""Conservative concerns over immigration have been merging with Republican worries about Obama's healthcare, economic and foreign policies, Oregon lawmaker Walden said.""It's morphed into something bigger than a debate over fixing our broken immigration system - it's a piece of the overall sense that things are on the wrong track in this country,"" he said.Hensarling said ""there's a lot of fear about that, about a president who has a pen and a phone, but doesn't seem to have a copy of the Constitution.""But Polis said even left-leaning voters are growing frustrated by the lack of progress in Congress on a long-term policy fix. A bipartisan June 2013 immigration reform bill that passed the Senate has been stalled in the House.Opinion polls show concerns about immigration extend to every region of the country, although they are most acutely felt in the southwestern states near the Mexican border.Despite voter concerns, political strategists from both parties say immigration is unlikely to be the deciding factor in any battleground midterm congressional race. Republicans must pick up six seats to reclaim control of the Senate in November, and are heavily favored to pad their comfortable majority in the House of Representatives.Only three Republican Senate contenders - New Hampshire's Scott Brown, Michigan's Terri Lynn Land, and Arkansas' Tom Cotton - have run advertisements about immigration. Vulnerable incumbents have largely avoided potentially controversial town halls that could force them to answer tough questions on the topic.National Democrats believe roughly two dozen House districts could see immigration play a role in November's result, and pundits frequently point to Colorado's competitive Senate race as the likeliest immigration battleground.But the candidates in that contest have sparred over other issues, and Republican Cory Gardner earlier this month voted with a mostly Democratic bloc not to repeal Obama's 2012 measure providing a stay of deportations to young undocumented migrants.

The interview was about the United States beginning to fly surveillance missions over Syria, as a prelude to bombing ISIS positions. The problem with Mike Baker was that he looked like he'd come out of central casting. He had a chiseled face and the spiky gelled hair of a seasoned actor in the kind of movies where Navy Seals successfully emerge with grateful hostages. If only the footage from Iraq and Syria had been outtakes from some film where everything worked out happily ever after. Mike Baker was as unreal as the footage was real. But the question is how someone like Baker was ever a covert operative. His appearance which was about as covert as the name of the company he was identified as running -- Diligence. If I were ISIS and I saw him on the street, he'd be a goner. He looked and talked with such poise and confidence that you wondered if he actually had done a stint in Hollywood before joining the CIA or created his role at the Actor's Studio. Everything was rational including his point that something more would be required than bombing to root ISIS out of Syria. And what would that something be perchance? Troops on the ground? Another private contractor named Blackwater had run into their fair share of problems for murdering civilians in Iraq (""Blackwater Shootings, 'Murder,' Iraq says,"" NYT, 10/8/07) but maybe Diligence LLC could provide that extra something in a more constrained and humane way.

Burger King Worldwide Inc. agreed to acquire Tim Hortons Inc. for about C$12.5 billion ($11.4 billion) in a deal that creates the third-largest fast-food company and moves its headquarters to Canada. Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb312642500009400389f62.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Burger King’s plan to merge with doughnut chain Tim Hortons in Canada may be a bad sign for Southeast Asia’s rainforests.Both companies have come under fire from environmental groups for their heavy use of questionably sourced palm oil. Skyrocketing demand for the oil, produced from red palm trees, has pushed plantation owners in Malaysia and Indonesia to cut down large swaths of rainforest. Now, advocates fear that Burger King's plan to build the fastest-growing fast food empire in the world will lead to a marked uptick in the destruction.“Few recognize the threat this merger poses to the world’s tropical rainforests,” Lael Goodman, an analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists, said in a statement. “Both companies have appalling track records on palm oil.”Palm oil is a vegetable oil used in everything from cosmetics to flavoring. Its popularity has soared since 2003, when the U.S. Food and Drug Administration began requiring manufacturers to list trans fats on nutrition labels and people started to eschew the unhealthy additive. More companies began turning to palm oil, which was believed to be better for heart health. Recent studies have suggested that the saturated fats in palm oil carry the same risk of heart disease as trans fats, but they haven't dampened palm oil's popularity.Burger King mixes it into its fry oil, and Tim Hortons uses it in its doughnut shortening mix and in specialty flavorings.Palm oil is pressed from red palm fruits. Though native to west Africa, 90 percent of the trees that produce the oil are now grown on huge plantations in Indonesia and Malaysia, according to the Rainforest Action Network. Palm oil sales jumped 485 percent in the U.S. alone in the last decade, and the boom has accelerated the destruction of rainforests in these two nations. The Indonesian government plans to convert 44 million acres of rainforest -- a land area the size of Missouri -- into palm oil plantations by 2020, according to a report by the Rainforest Action Network. By 2022, the U.N. Environment Program estimates that 98 percent of forests in the country could be destroyed. The industry's growth has destroyed the habitats of endangered orangutans, rare Sumatran rhinos and Sumatran elephants. (Fewer than 2,800 of the elephants still exist.) Indigenous peoples have also been forced, sometimes violently, off their lands. Numerous food and cosmetic companies, including Burger King, have sought certification from the nonprofit Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil. The designation means the company uses oil from plantations that limit deforestation and abide by human rights laws, but Laurel Sutherlin of the Rainforest Action Network said the effort falls short. Pristine rainforest cleared in Indonesia's Borneo region for palm oil production “A company can say, ‘Hey, we’re sustainably certified.’ And it sounds good, but it’s not,” Sutherlin told The Huffington Post. “The RSPO has a really spotty track record.”An investigation by Greenpeace last year charged that rules set by the RSPO failed to prevent the rapid destruction of rainforest lands by fires. And the Union of Concerned Scientists has alleged that some GreenPalm certificates, granted by the RSPO to label eco-friendly palm oil, are auctioned off to companies that may not actually meet the standards. Environmental groups have repeatedly urged corporations to pledge to take extra steps to make sure they're using sustainable palm oil.Burger King told HuffPost the palm oil it uses meets RSPO standards. According to a disclaimer on RSPO's site, the organization has not independently verified Burger King's adherence to its criteria. Stefano Savi, a spokesman for the RSPO, did not respond to a request for comment.Tim Hortons did not reply to requests for comment either, but a June report by two wildlife nonprofits said the company hoped to unveil a traceable, sustainable supply line for palm oil by April 2015. “The fast food industry as a whole is pretty far behind other industries,” Goodman told HuffPost. Many packaged food and cosmetic companies have gone beyond RSPO guidelines to give extra assurance that their palm oil is sustainable, Goodman said, but many fast food companies have not.The timing of Burger King’s latest news may put increased pressure on already-stressed palm oil producers, Goodman said.

(AP Photo/Heri Juanda)“Palm oil is heading into its peak production season,” Ivy Ng, an analyst at the Malaysia-based market research firm CIMB, said in a statement.Palm oil is increasingly being used for biofuel throughout Asia, pushing the price even higher. And fears that El Niño, a periodic warming in the Pacific region, will affect crops this summer have put added pressure on Indonesian producers in recent months.As producers blaze ahead, clearing more rainforest to meet rising demand, Sutherlin said companies urgently need to adopt additional policies for using sustainable palm oil.“Some of these companies have put out these guidelines for 2020. That’s just not helpful -- this is an urgent problem that needs an urgent response,” Sutherlin said. “Palm oil is right now the leading cause of what’s threatening orangutans -- and you can say goodbye to Sumatran tigers, Sumatran elephants, Sumatran rhinos, too.” "

The morning jog of a Nauruan resident could consist of crossing the island back and forth.   Over time Nauru could prompt a new world record of sorts: the smallest nation on earth to face up to the climate change Goliath which is currently threatening the very existence of around 50 Small Island Developing States (SIDS), with its ravaging cocktail of warmer, wilder weather and rising oceans, among other maladies. The first step towards lasting change can happen as soon as next week. A milestone will unfold in Samoa from September 1-4 when the Third International Conference on the SIDS brings together dozens of heads of state and global leaders to address the many challenges these vulnerable states face. SIDS are increasingly confronting issues linked to climate change and rising sea levels. These include: natural resource depletion, soil degradation, land and coastal pollution and, to top it all, stronger and more frequent storms capable of setting back the development clock by many years. In 2009, the Carteret Islanders of Papua New Guinea became the first community to be entirely displaced by climate change due to rising sea levels.Drawing on lessons learned from a history of geographical, cultural and economic fragmentation, coupled with a complex colonial experience, island nations are rapidly getting better at working together. As a result, ""partnerships"" has become the conference's buzzword. Hundreds of registered participants are ready to describe how south-south, north-south and SIDS-SIDS collaboration are helping to set a positive course for island nations.SIDS were first recognized in the context of the 1992 Earth Summit, the birthplace of the first international environmental convention for which my organization, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), has been serving as a financial mechanism ever since.Vital SeasOceans will be prominent in Samoa, as renewed global attention to marine issues is also helping to place the SIDS under sharper focus. Many want to be recognized as Ocean States so they can better focus their development strategies on the richness of their marine ecosystems. The average land area of a SIDS country is about 9,300 mi2 but their average EEZ is close to 270,000 mi2. So, for most island nations, wealth and natural capital are concentrated in their oceanic Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs). Under the United Nations Law of the Sea, SIDS have both the acquired right and the opportunity to manage this huge area to benefit their people, and by doing so, contribute to the health of the global environment. In order to realize this potential, SIDS must be empowered both politically and practically to manage this tremendous wealth in a sustainable manner. Nowhere is this relationship more evident than in management of fisheries and other marine resources. SIDS are quickly being equipped to prevent a large expanse of ocean -- some 20 percent of the global EEZs -- becoming like the dystopian Waterworld where finite resources are reaped by whoever holds most economic and technological power in a no-man's oceanscape. Unhappy with the predatory harvesting of one of their greatest assets, tuna, Pacific Island nations have orchestrated a common plan to deal with rampant unsustainable practices. By setting common allowable catch limits at more sustainable levels and by better enforcing access rights to their EEZs, total annual revenues have quadrupled to $240 million/year since 1997. Energy is another major priority. SIDS contribute very little to the build-up of greenhouse gases, however energy is a major expense that could be used more effectively for other development priorities. For Aruba, 16 percent of GDP is taken up to import 6,500 barrels of diesel a day to generate electricity. And yet, SIDS are blessed by abundant renewable energy potential. Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind, are ideally suited to larger islands as well as to the smallest and most remote corners of archipelago nations that would never economically justify being connected to an electrical grid. For a large number of SIDS, the first four days of September could become the launch pad for new sustainable development paths. With the proper support from donors and technical assistance agencies, the Samoa conference may very well be all that is needed to unleash the true potential of these global gems of the ocean world."

Photo: Jason Holland, InternationalLiving.comWhile living in the San Francisco Bay Area my husband and I both worked long days, and too many weekends. We rarely bumped into our neighbors, had little free time for socializing, and even less energy.We hoped that would change when we moved to Ambergris Caye, Belize--though we worried that by basing ourselves on a small island we might be in for a limited social circle. And what if it didn't suit us? It was a big unknown.Well, we've been surprised by how much our social horizons have actually expanded since our overseas move. This is an unexpected benefit of the expat life. And from what I hear from other expats based outside Belize, it holds true across the board.First of all, we now have the time and energy for an active social life. And our openness to it has been rewarded by the broad array of diverse and interesting people we've met living here. Many have become close friends. The tropical climate and genuine beauty of Ambergris Caye draws people from all over and we've met acquaintances from far flung corners of the globe.Meeting people is often as simple as taking a trip into town. Ambergris Caye is an active community. People get involved, and they enjoy the outdoors. Any day of the week you'll run into people walking or running on the beach, riding their bikes into town--to run errands, work in their businesses, donate time at the Saga Humane Society, or meet friends at a favorite hotspot for lunch... Photo: Jason Holland, InternationalLiving.comAnd a nice benefit is that--unlike in the States where our friends tended to be ""like us"" in age and income bracket...here we interact with all kinds of people--from all over the world. Some live here full-time and own homes here, some simply vacation here regularly.Most of us spend our lives with people who are pretty much like ourselves. It's not easy to break out of that mold in North America--especially when you are busy. But once you embrace the expat life you'll automatically interact with people who are a world away from your friends back home. You'll learn about their countries and cultures...their favorite ethnic dishes...it's a mind-opening experience.Our new friends span a spectrum of ages, cultures, races, and careers as well as religious and political backgrounds. At times we socialize with frugal folks on a budget, at the other end of the spectrum, we find ourselves hobnobbing with multimillionaires.And I'm amazed at the unexpected places I've made a new acquaintance. Some of the most interesting conversations have occurred while working out on a treadmill... or participating on a volunteer project.At times my husband and I strike up a conversation with visitors at the next table. Another favorite spot to meet new friends is while walking our dogs on the beach. We met one British couple at a yoga class. They are now close friends and have invited us to visit them at their other homes, in London and the French Alps. They split their time between Ambergris Caye and their other two homes.If you're friendly, the possibilities are endless. Every overseas town has at least a few favorite hot spots where visitors, locals and expats gather. Just find a place that's comfortable for you--then frequent it.Every Friday we head to Wine de Vine for their wine and cheese tasting to mingle with friends. We regularly invite friends over to help taste test our latest culinary experiment... Sundays are beach BBQ days. So we often go out for BBQ and to meet friends and listen to live music. On other Sunday afternoons we join friends at the end of a favorite dock, south of town. We chit chat over an icy cold beverage while enjoying the stunning Caribbean seascape and refreshing breeze... Other new visitors come and go...You don't need to be a social butterfly to meet new friends overseas. Start by attending community events, volunteering, or helping out a neighbor... If you are a regular church attendee, you'll find plenty of churches where you can meet people. And when you attend local events, you'll find it's quite natural to chat with the people around you...The people you meet as an expat may come from the far corners of the world, but you will have a common bond. After all, expats are adventurers. They're willing to step out of their comfort zone...to take a risk by moving overseas... You'll tell one another stories and share your craziest expat experiences...laugh about those experiences...and learn from one another. Once you become an expat and expand your social horizons, your life will be enriched in unexpected and marvelous ways.Related Articles: I Found My Ideal Water View in Belize Life on a Caribbean Island: Just $1,300 a Month Travel in Belize: Top 10 Things to Do"
