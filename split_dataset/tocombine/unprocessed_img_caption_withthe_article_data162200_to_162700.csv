According to the National Parks Service, the one mile-deep chasm is now visited by five million people each year. Most drink in the view from the overlooks dotting the South Rim as its the most accessible part of the Park and is open all year. More intrepid travelers see the sights from the North Rim, which is 10 miles across the Canyon from the South Rim, and is much tougher to access. For those who find that just one day of awe and beauty isn't enough, spend the night at the historic El Tovar Hotel or the Bright Angel Lodge & Cabins. There's also the Phantom Ranch, which is the only lodging available below the Canyon rim. Just make sure to bring your own water bottle. Until you can get there yourself, here's a little bit of the Grand Canyon for you to enjoy. "
1,PARENTING,5 Ways to Feel Like a Hot Mama Again!,"Erin Cox, Contributor
Hay House Author, inspirational speaker, and mom of three who ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/self-confidence_us_5b9cdba2e4b03a1dcc82797b,"Raising kids, running a household, maintaining relationships, working, etc. can make us absolutely exhausted and worn out...",2013-02-26,Confident woman with arms crossed against a blue background,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cdba226000036007fa5b8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sexiness is definitely not only about the way you look; it's all about how you present yourself to the world. It is about having a sense of humor and being passionate, on fire, purposeful and self-confident. Sexy women are not always the most physically beautiful, but they dress and carry themselves in a way that is inspiring and infectious. They exude self-love and positive energy, and tend to attract everyone around them!  Every woman has a hot mama within. You read that right. Each of you has a unique sexiness and special aura. Sometimes, this special gift gets buried under anxiety, poor self-esteem or a lack of self-love and can prevent us from bringing our very best to the world.Once you start re-igniting your passion for life and loving yourself enough to care for your mind, body, spirit, and appearance... you will know you've reclaimed your mojo and brought sexy back. People will want to be around you. You'll feel sexier, and your partner and men in general will notice you. YOU are worth it!  1) Get Your Mojo Workout On! Sometimes, the best thing to revive your mojo is to lose yourself in a fun and invigorating workout. The key is to do something that makes you smile while you sweat and treat your body well! A few sexy mojo-inducing exercise ideas include Zumba, hip-hop dancing, pole dancing, martial arts, rock climbing or just going for a brisk walk or jog while listening to your favorite jamming music.   2) Take Time for Yourself Raising kids, running a household, maintaining relationships, working, etc. can make us absolutely exhausted and worn out... which is completely normal, but not sexy. Take time for solitude to rejuvenate yourself and practice self-care so you have the energy to love and care for yourself, your family and live your life with joy! Some ideas? Wake up early for silence, prayer and meditation. Go out and have a cup of coffee or glass of wine by yourself. It's empowering and sexy to have the confidence to sit somewhere by yourself and enjoy a drink. Take a hot bath with lavender bath salt or bubble bath. Read a book or just close your eyes and smile.3) Feel Beautiful Feeling beautiful is a key component of reviving your sexiness! The way we take care of our ""outside"" reflects how we feel about ourselves on the inside. Take care of your grooming in a way that reflects how much you love yourself. Try a few of these easy ideas to feel prettier now: smile, wear lipstick, paint your nails, get a haircut, have your makeup applied professionally at a department store (for free!), get a sassy new pair of shoes, take the time to slowly apply lotion to your body after a shower and get rid of clothes that make you feel frumpy.4) Stoke your Creative and Intellectual Fires Creative and intellectual stimulation are crucial for anyone to live a well-balanced life, but especially for moms. Smart and imaginative women are sexy! Engaging in deep, intelligent and meaningful conversations can bring any relationship to a deeper level. Creative expression is one of the easiest things to let go by the wayside as a mother. But taking the time to nurture your intellect and your creative spirit is one of the key ingredients to not losing yourself to motherhood. Taking time to nourish this side of yourself will make you a happier and sexier woman, and a more balanced person. 5) Claim Your Sexiness Motherhood might equal frumpy and sexless to some. But in my mind, it equals confidence and sensuality in an entirely new, beautiful, maternal-goddess kind of way. Use the motherhood experience as a catalyst to give you the confidence to go after what you really want, both sexually and in the rest of your life. Now is the time to spice things back up and ask for what you really want in bed. Trust me, men find assertive women to be quite a turn-on. This confident seductress in the bedroom will pleasantly surprise your partner.It's important to get into a sexy frame of mind to have a hotter love life. Getting enough sleep and getting yourself ""in the mood"" before joining your partner in bed can really help this process. You have been working hard on your body and on becoming more confident, so use this to your advantage in the bedroom. You are beautiful and attractive, and I promise that you can get your mama mojo back in the bedroom, too. I would love to hear about what makes you feel like a hot mama -- please share in the comments below!"

People did not have personal cars or the option to take taxis or buses. In order to buy basic items such as food, clothes and housing supplies, most people walked. Children often had to walk for miles each way to attend school. Health clubs and gyms, or what we now consider formal exercise, were uncommon as people were active by necessity. Today, very little movement is needed to accomplish our daily errands. Technology has made our lives easier and more sedentary. Most items can be purchased by a few clicks on the computer, picking up the phone, or driving to the store. Scientific studies have demonstrated repeatedly the tremendous health benefits of daily exercise including: cardio protection, reduction in weight and body fat, reduction in stress, improvement in bone density and better sleep. Activity used to be naturally incorporated into our daily routines. The challenge of our current generation is to find purposeful ways to move and exercise. To many, the thought of exercise involves going to a gym and engaging in an intense activity, which can be inaccessible, expensive, and overwhelming. If we look back to prior generations, when people were more naturally active, we can incorporate their daily habits into today's world. Several examples include: 1) Walking or biking to work as opposed to driving; 2) climbing stairs instead of taking an elevator; and 3) taking a short walk around the block as a break during the day. In addition to cardiovascular benefits, these activities provide stress relief, which can also improve work productivity and sleep.As I mentioned in my previous blog, the workplace is also an opportunity for people to be more active. If there was an exercise culture at work, where it was encouraged to take a little time throughout the day to move, it would transition people into more activity. Taking a brief walk after lunch, instead of sitting in the lunch room, would allow co-workers to exercise in addition to socializing. Making stairwells brighter and more enticing would encourage people to climb stairs as opposed to using the elevator. In larger companies, gyms are built on site, allowing people easy access to exercise facilities. Additionally, standing desks that move at a very slow pace keep people in constant motion all day, burning calories and creating more strength. These are just a few examples of how the workplace can truly help influence the way in which we use our body during our long days at work.I recently treated a patient who exemplified the concept that a small change in activity level can make a big difference in health outcome. My patient was a very sedentary overweight individual who decided it was time for him to work on developing a healthier lifestyle. He started by walking one block each day. That block turned into two blocks. Then he added four flights of stairs. He also cut down his portions slightly. By the time I saw him six months later, he was walking 10 blocks and climbing eight flights of stairs a day, and he had lost 40 lbs. He was not going to the gym or running marathons, but just adding a small amount of activity to his daily life resulted in a tremendous outcome. Additionally, he felt he could sustain the changes he made and proud of his accomplishment. A small change can make a big difference. What small change can you make in your life today?For more by Monica O. Weinberg, MD., click here. For more on fitness and exercise, click here."

She is beautiful. And she is a child.,2013-02-26,"HOLLYWOOD, CA - FEBRUARY 24: Actress Quvenzhane Wallis arrives at the Oscars at Hollywood & Highland Center on February 24, 2013 in Hollywood, California. (Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cdbf73c0000320009ed7e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Written by Sabrina James for ParentingSunday night I sat down to watch the Oscar red carpet with my 6-year-old daughter Kaia. She played dress-up with her American Girl doll while I followed the commentary on Twitter. ""Look, Mommy! Julie's all ready for the red carpet,"" she exclaimed, showing off the updo she created for her doll. She watched with mild interest until the moment we'd been waiting for arrived: 9-year-old Quvenzhané Wallis appeared in a frenzy of flashing camera lights with her mom and sister in tow. ""Look, Mommy, there she is! Look at her purse! It's a puppy!"" Kaia jumped up and down. ""I want one of those!"" What a moment! I wanted my daughter to see a little girl, just like her, walking the red carpet among the most talented women in Hollywood. Quvenzhané did not disappoint. She was sassy and confident while talking to reporters. And she was dressed in a perfectly age-appropriate Armani gown that she chose because ""it's sparkly!"" Her mom looked on, proud as can be. I had a tear in my eye. ""Do you know that she's going to play Annie in the new movie?"" I asked. Kaia's smile was so big. ""Wow, Mommy! She's the luckiest girl in the world!"" I have been a huge fan of Quvenzhané from the moment I saw the trailer for ""Beasts of the Southern Wild."" She made the movie when she was only six years old and earned herself a Best Actress Oscar nomination for her performance. She deserves a standing ovation from us. Instead, on her special night, she was subjected to the most distasteful showing of adult ""humor"" I have ever seen. It started with a ""joke"" by Oscar host Seth MacFarlane about how it will be ""sixteen years before she's too old"" for George Clooney, but sadly it didn't stop there. The popular satire site The Onion tweeted the following to its more than 4 million followers during the show: ""Everyone else seems afraid to say it, but that Quvenzhané Wallis is kind of a ____, right?""(If you want to see the actual tweet, it's here.)As if it wasn't bad enough that she was sexualized in front of her peers during what was undoubtedly the most exciting night of her life, but to be further humiliated on a social networking site and called one of the most degrading terms that can be used toward women is reprehensible. The Onion is a site known for its sarcasm and although I'm sure they didn't mean it, does that make it better? Am I supposed to laugh at the absurdity of the statement? Am I supposed to look at my daughter and think, wow, it would be really really funny and smart if someone jokingly called her the c word? How ironic.Plus: How to Raise a Media-Savvy KidMany online have tried to make this a race issue. Saying she was singled out because she's a young black girl. I hope that's not the case. To me, this has less to do with race and everything to do with the fact that we have stopped respecting the innocence of our children. We've become so desensitized by the Toddlers and Tiaras culture that we take hurtful aim at those who epitomize childhood as much as the fluffy puppy purses they carry on the red carpet. Imagine what went through Quvenzhané's mother's mind when someone pulled her aside Sunday night to tell her what happened. Did her stomach bottom out like mine did? Did she look at her daughter with a tear in her eye and think why? Why tonight? What is wrong with this world? I want my little girl to know she can do anything she sets her mind to. She can be herself, silly purse and all, and star in whatever version of life she desires. Kaia went to sleep Sunday night clutching her American Girl doll tight, updo still in place, as I imagine Q did with her puppy purse. Both, I am sure, completely unaware of the storm brewing online in defense of little girls like them. In defense of their innocence. When our children take their turn in the spotlight, they have the right to leave it unscathed. It's our job as adults to protect them. Plus: How to Talk to Your Kids About RaceI wish the headlines today were different. I wish we lived in a world where Quvenzhané could wake up the morning after the Oscars and search the Internet with her mama to find herself on our best-dressed lists. To see celebrities like Oprah and Beyoncé, her biggest fans, rave about her. Instead her family must hide the horrible truth from her-- the truth that our media took a cheap shot at someone too small to stand up for herself or to even know what the word she was called means. The way we treat our kids is no laughing matter. Quvenzhané Wallis is a lot of things. She is smart. She is sassy. She is talented. She is beautiful. And she is a child. She is not the c word. But thanks to the insensitive staffer at The Onion who decided to tweet and then recant the vulgar comment, this incident too is one of the ways she'll be remembered.As chief executive Steve Hannah of The Onion wrote in his apology Monday morning, ""Miss Wallis, you are young and talented and deserve better. All of us at The Onion are deeply sorry."" We all are, little girl.

The World Economic Forum (WEF) is taking place from January 23 to 27.

""To become the absolute best place to work, communication and collaboration will be important, so we need to be working side-by-side ... That is why it is critical that we are all present in our offices,"" read the memo written by head of HR Jackie Reses and obtained by AllThingsD. “Speed and quality are often sacrificed when we work from home.” Employees and the general public alike were dismayed by the news -- particularly as many companies move toward more flexible work hours, influenced by reports that a looser work schedule is healthy for workers -- and for the bottom line. Even the White House has compiled a comprehensive report, extolling the attributes to wellbeing of flexible work policies. It should come as no surprise that Mayer, known for her hard-charging work ethic and two-week maternity leave, would prefer an all in-house staff. But are flex hours merely a luxurious refuge for the underperforming or, in the current work culture, a necessity for many in the workforce?Research on employees who use flexible hours and work from home points toward the latter. Studies regularly show that employees who are given some choice as to their schedule and location of work report better self-care behaviors like increased exercise and regular doctors' visits, better sleep habits, less stress, less depression and less work-life conflict. A 2010 Cochrane research review looked at the results of 10 studies evaluating more than 16,000 people. They found that self-scheduling work time improved a variety of health metrics, including reduced exhaustion, improved sleep (both duration and quality), lowered blood pressure, improved mental health and better self-rated health status. The distinction of self-scheduled, meaning the choice belongs to the employee, is important to note: As the authors wrote in their report, ""In contrast, interventions that were motivated or dictated by organizational interests, such as fixed-term contract and involuntary part-time employment, found equivocal or negative health effects.""""Flexible working seems to be more beneficial for health and wellbeing where the individuals control their own work patterns, rather than where employers are in control,"" review author Clare Bambra, of the Wolfson Research Institute at Durham Univerisy in the UK, said in a statement. ""Given the limited evidence base, we wouldn't want to make any hard and fast recommendations, but these findings certainly give employers and employees something to think about.""One well-known study looked deeper into the health impact of flexible work environment by following 608 white-collar workers at the headquarters of Best Buy before and after a flexible “Results Only Work Environment” policy was implemented. The researchers found that, on average, employees got one additional hour of sleep per work night after flex-hours were implemented and were more likely to exercise. They were more apt to go to the doctor when they needed to and were less likely to go into the office when contagious. From a mental health standpoint, the subjects reported that they felt ""greater mastery"" of their time, had fewer work-life conflicts and, as a result, felt increased energy, less stress and a self-reported sense of well-being. ""Flex time is a way to get control over work. We can't reduce the overload of tasks, but flexible schedules make it a bit more manageable,"" co-author of the Best Buy study, Phyllis Moen, Ph.D., McKnight Presidential Endowed Chair of Sociology at the University of Minnesota tells HuffPost. ""We're expected to work smarter, do more with less and with fewer people. And what has enabled workers to continue to work with this level of intensity is often that they now arrange when they work.""""And yet I can't imagine [Mayer] will tamp down on the intensity of work,"" Moen adds. ""What she's asking for isn't just a relocation shift -- she's ratching up time pressures when you want to be more flexible. Time pressure has a negative effect on people who are going to be expected to work long hours."" Further, many of the employees affected by Mayer's new policy are already accustomed to working on their own schedule and in their own environment. What will happen to the health of workers who have grown accustomed to flexible work hours and must now return to their office desks full time? ""We have no studies looking at what happens when you take it away, but the assumption would be that it would have negative effects,"" says Moen. ""It will mean a lack of control -- and feeling a lack of control over one's life is associated with greater psychological stress."""

(Photo by John Shearer/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cdb961f00005000216425.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Costume designer Jacqueline Durran just won an Oscar for her work on the film Anna Karenina. Recently, I had the privilege of interviewing Ms. Durran about her work on Anna Karenina and her collaboration with the film's director, Joe Wright. For this version of Anna Karenina, the decision was made to reinterpret the period costumes and not to faithfully reproduce them from Tolstoy's novel. Following is my interview with Ms. Durran about her work on the film. The interview sheds light on the carefully crafted work that goes into setting the tone for a film via costume design.Is there an overriding arc to the costumes? Are there crucial points in the film represented by the costumes?The undergarments that she wears in the beginning and the end were very similar, but they are different colors. And the black ballgown she wears when she first meets Vronsky is mirrored in the white ball gown she wears at the end when she is humiliated at the opera. So there are reflections of the costumes, but there isn't an overriding arc from start to finish.Was the fur in the movie vintage and was it real?  It was all real fur, unfortunately, because we couldn't find substitutes that looked in any way as good as the fur we needed for the collars. And we tried to use vintage fur as much as possible. The costume houses have quite a lot of vintage fur that they have accumulated over the years. In the few cases we couldn't find something, we would have to buy from a furrier.Tell us about the jewelry used in the film? Way back in the beginning in a discussion with Joe (Wright) and Keira, we thought it would be good for all the jewelry that Anna wore to be real. Because she lived in this rarefied world of late 19th century Russia where there was a lot of wealth, and it seemed to play into the kind of vanity of Anna as a character to have a wide range of jewelry as a character. Once we decided that Anna would be wearing diamonds and pearls a lot, we approached Chanel and they were more than willing to help us. We went to Paris and they gave us free reign. So from the contemporary collection, I used all of the pieces which I thought were period. So the Comedia necklace is very modern, and very feminine. And the earrings with the filigree of diamond with pearls were borrowed from Chanel and I thought they fit very well. I loved watching the jewels on screen to me, they really add something. I don't know anything that glitters like diamonds.Tolstoy described Anna as fastidious in her dress and appearance. She had a dressmaker and she was described as wearing Venetian lace & black velvet. Did you look at that?No, I looked at the book, but in the end you have to go with the vision of the director and the screenwriter. Because Joe had a vision of his film not being an actual 1870s show, but one in which he wanted to pare down all of the details. That brought the costumes down to a kind of silhouette. Give all that it didn't make sense to follow a description of a dress in the book.When she went to the ball, she wore a black dress as she did in the novel. For that scene we went with the book because that was a picture of Anna, but we didn't make the dress as described. The reason we decided to go with it is because it is one of the most famous costumes in literature, but also because it works in the kind of visual structure we were building for the movie. So that fact that the crowd costumes, there were 25 shades of pastel, that really sets her (Anna) off in black. The costume design in the film was reinterpreted,we didn't refer back to the novel for any costume details. We didn't take a direct interpretation from Tolstoy.  Tell us about the veils that Anna wore.In the beginning, Joe and I thought the movie was an opportunity to use veiled faces because there's something some magical and gorgeous about veiled faces. We don't see them much in modern life. We meet with a milliner and discussed weights an fabrics. And we had hats with veils made. We knew the one with the very light embroidery would be the one she wore on the train. I didn't know when I was making the costumes exactly how they would be used by Joe (Wright, the director.) For example the scene with her son, when she is crying, I had no idea the scene would be played with the veil down.Sean Barrett was the milliner from the UK that we used. When she (Anna) goes to Princess Betsy's party wearing the feather headdress the feathers go into a diamond. Those kinds of things have long since disappeared.Did you watch any of the other Anna films?No, I purposefully didn't watch any of them. I felt that with such iconic women previously playing Anna (Vivien Leigh, Greta Garbo) I might be bound to be influenced by them.Was there anything that inspired you?I looked at a lot of paintings. I tried to get as much visual reference as I could. We went to Russia for a few days and looked at museums in Moscow. In the end, it was true that Russian high society was very influenced by fashions from Paris. For Russian regional fashion, we tried to explore that with Levin's character. All of the peasant costumes we made for the film. Those were authentic as they were happening outside the theater So we weren't so concerned with reinterpreting. Everyone who worked within the theater wore a uniform. The men wore Russian grey uniforms. The women wore a generic Victorian grey dress with apron to signify their function, in the story."

Someone was totally wrong because it has stirred up an ""s-word"" storm for The Onion, which led to today's very unusual apology:Feb. 25, 2013Dear Readers,On behalf of The Onion, I offer my personal apology to Quvenzhané Wallis and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences for the tweet that was circulated last night during the Oscars. It was crude and offensive -- not to mention inconsistent with The Onion's commitment to parody and satire, however biting. No person should be subjected to such a senseless, humorless comment masquerading as satire. Miss Wallis, you are young and talented and deserve better...Sincerely,The OnionThousands of people have already weighed in to The Onion. Many felt the word was offensive and slammed The Onion. Others shrugged it off and felt the publication was just doing what it does... satire. And no doubt the swirl of controversy itself is much bigger than the tweet ever was. It has shed light on something we all struggle with as parents. Where is the line in the sand? When should it be crossed... and what happens if we do? In my opinion, there are some words which should just be eradicated from the vocabulary altogether and they go far behind George Carlin's seven dirty words. The ""c"" word is one of those. The ""n"" word is one of those. I'm sure there are others. And while you might agree with me, you might not. The bottom line for me is that my line in the sand may be different than yours or other parents'. And that's OK. The good news is, as the parent to my kids, I get to teach them how I want them taught. In my case, I'm taking a blowtorch to those certain words and getting rid of them. And other parents get to make the same choice regarding their kids. It's lessons like this that make it clear each parent must stick to his or her own convictions and at least draw a line in the sand... wherever that line may be."

Ed's mother died when he was only five days old. How does a child grow up without the fear of losing loved ones? Deb had an abusive father. How does she trust men to not be abusive?It's not unusual to live with a deep fear that a worst-case scenario, such as becoming homeless, could happen to us. Many people find themselves living on the street through no fault of their own. Yet how many of us acknowledge street people as fellow human beings with needs no different from ours, simply without the means to fulfill them? Recently, Ed was talking with a street person who turned out to be the son of an old friend. But instead, how often do we avert our eyes when we go by, pretending they don't exist? In an attempt to find out what it would take to see homeless people as being no different from himself, Rev. James Morton, the dean of St. John the Divine Cathedral in New York, began an experiment. As Zen teacher Grover Gauntt told us: He designed what he called the plunge: an act of diving into unknown waters and getting completely whacked and disorientated so you can orientate yourself in a new way. And he applied this to the street by sending his ministers out without any money, no place to live, no identification, just like the people they were serving.From here developed the idea of street retreats: purposefully living on the street for a few days to bring participants into the very midst of society's neediest, and by doing so to seek a sense of inclusivity. Bernie Glassman, founding teacher of the Zen Peacemaker Order, talked to us for our award winning book, BE THE CHANGE, How Meditation Can Transform You and the World. He told us:Street retreats are where we live and practice meditation on the streets, begging and sleeping rough just as any homeless person would. I included meditation, as I wanted to show that meditation is not just sitting on a cushion but reaches every aspect of life. It's a way of bringing us into a state of inclusivity and of not-knowing, and when that happens the experience of oneness arises. But at the same time we have the experience of not existing. When you're homeless and begging, people walk past you, you're completely ignored, you simply don't exist. When you've been so ignored, it becomes impossible to do the same to another person, you can no longer look away from anybody or anything.We all dread stepping out of our comfort zone, of what is familiar and known. But when we do, we can discover enormous reserves of strength within ourselves, as Oscar-winning actress Ellen Burstyn told us she did.I did the street retreat because I was so afraid of it. I could physically feel how much fear I had about being away from my comfort zone, my bed, and especially not having any identity, "" said Ellen in our book. ""The whole idea of begging was terrifying. The first time I did it, I had to a cross a street to a restaurant with tables outside. Two women were eating there and as I walked toward them I felt like I was crossing over a line that I had consciously never known was there. I was purposefully stepping through my ego to experience what was on the other side. I approached the women and simply asked, 'Excuse me, but I need a dollar for the subway. Could either of you spare a dollar?' The woman closest to me reached into her pocket and handed me a dollar without taking her eyes off her companion's face. I said 'Thank you' and walked away. I felt a strange pride that I had really accomplished something, but then enormous sadness as I realized that neither of the women had looked at me. I'd got what I needed, but I'd been disregarded and unseen.This invisibility is one of the biggest difficulties for the homeless. As Grover Gauntt, who is a street retreat leader, says:Homeless people get categorized as being alcoholics, drug addicts, there to rip you off, or just plain crazy. But every homeless person has a story and a history, just like we do. Before I first took the plunge I was fearful of confrontation, but I learned that confrontation is just disguised fear. I rarely pass a homeless person now without saying a few words and acknowledging him or her as a human being.Doing anything outside of our experience is a plunge, especially stepping into places that we resist or are fearful of. The added ingredient of meditation enables us to step beyond our boundaries and deepens the experience of inclusivity, that we are all a part of our shared humanity. HuffPost blogger Kiri Westby, a contributor to our Be The Change Meditate e-Conference, experienced this when she ran a shelter in Nepal for trafficked girls. I needed to meditate before I could even leave my room in the morning. It gave me the strength to recognize that suffering is the human experience that we all have in one form or another, and not to feel overwhelmed by it, not to lose my balance. Without that meditation, without that space each morning, I would have been too filled with the suffering; I would have been paralyzed by it.Do you have a story of when you were able to step into the unknown?

Milk prices could spike to $6 to $8 a gallon in January if lawmakers fail to reach a 'fiscal cliff' deal and renew a Farm Bill that's been in place since 2008 and sets the price at which the government buys milk. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cdb192000004e00fdbdeb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Food activist Nancy Huehnergarth tweeted this troubling Dairy Reporter item last Friday, which indicates that International Dairy Foods Association (IDFA) and the National Milk Producers Federation (NMPF) are asking the Food & Drug Administration for permission to add aspartame and other artificial sweeteners to the flavored milk sold in U.S. schools without certain front-label disclosures. The trade groups cite the current childhood obesity crisis and the popularity of flavored milk among kids as justifications for their request.Now, keep in mind that the milk industry always had the ability to add artificial sweeteners to dairy products, including flavored milks sold in schools. So what's going on here?Under current FDA regulations, dairy products containing artificial sweeteners (with a recent exception carved out for ice cream) must not only disclose those sweeteners in their ingredient listings, but also bear prominent front label notices -- such as ""reduced calorie"" or ""reduced sugar"" -- as part of the products' so-called statements of identity. Yet now the dairy industry is getting a hearing on its 2009 citizen's petition (PDF linked here) asking FDA for permission to abandon those front label disclosures for artificially dairy sweetened products -- and not just on flavored milk, but also on seventeen other dairy products having nothing to do with schools, including whipping cream, sour cream, nonfat dry mik and more.It may well be that American school children really are the motivation for the dairy industry petition. The school dairy market is a lucrative one (nearly 430 million gallons of milk were reportedly distributed in schools during the 2005-2006 school year) and IDFA has been remarkably candid in admitting that the labeling change, if successful, might stem the current decline in student milk consumption. And in support of its citizen's petition, the industry's main arguments, offered without a shred of supporting evidence, do focus on children. It argued that: ""use of the phrase ""reduced calorie"" is not attractive to children,"" and also put forward this (silly and rather circular) contention:Children and adolescents are the largest consumer of flavored milk, but as consumers, they are not inclined to recognize that the milk they drink contains added sugar. Milk flavored with non-nutritive sweetener, which has less sugar than other flavored milk, provides the same nutritional benefits as other flavored labeled ""milk,"" but with fewer calories. Thus, milk flavored with non-nutritive sweeteners should be labeled as ""milk"" without further qualification so that consumers can more easily identify its overall nutritional value.But given that the dairy industry is also asking for changes with respect to seventeen other products, one wonders if it's not using the appealing image of ""school children drinking wholesome, lower calorie milk"" as a Trojan horse to quietly overhaul the labeling of the entire dairy aisle.Whatever the motivation for the petition, it's hard for me to express how bad I think this idea is.First of all, the front label ""reduced calorie"" or ""reduced sugar"" disclosures have always been prominent and useful tip-offs to purchasers that a product may contain artificial sweeteners or other artificial ingredients that many find questionable. To remove those designations from the labels of milk and seventeen other dairy products will leave many American consumers in the dark about what they're actually buying. (Even I, an avid label-reader, have occasionally put into my shopping cart products like flavored water thinking they were entirely unsweetened, only to find later that they contained stevia, aspartame or one of the other non-nutritive additives I choose to avoid.)Moreover, I've long objected to the notion that artificial sweeteners are some sort of a panacea with respect to childhood obesity. Putting aside concerns about the safety of these additives (and some experts are concerned), artificial sweeteners do nothing to wean children off the sugary food and beverage habit -- and may even heighten a desire for sweet tastes given that artificial sweeteners are actually sweeter than sugar. Even more troubling, new Yale University research indicates that the regular consumption of artificial sweeteners may interfere with brain chemistry and the hormones regulating appetite and satiety, and may also pose in increased risk of Type 2 diabetes and obesity.Do we really want these additives appearing more frequently in the milk offered in school cafeterias around the country, without adequate labeling?I answer that question with a resounding NO. If you care to comment on the proposed rules, as I certainly intend to, you may do so here."

The vaccination programme against swine flu started on October 26, 2009 in Germany primarily for at-risk groups like employees of the health and security sector. In the following week pregnant women as well as chronically ill people will be immunised, said a spokesperson of the Thuringian Health Ministry. AFP PHOTO DDP / THOMAS LOHNES GERMANY OUT (Photo credit should read THOMAS LOHNES/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cdcee2000003000fdbed0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Kate KellandLONDON, Feb 27 (Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline's Pandemrix swine flu vaccine has been linked to cases of the rare sleep disorder narcolepsy in children in a scientific study in England that confirms similar findings elsewhere in Europe.The vaccine, more than 30 million doses of which were given during the H1N1 flu pandemic in 2009-2010, contains a booster, or adjuvant, and may have triggered an adverse immune reaction in some children at higher genetic risk of narcolepsy, scientists said in new research published on Wednesday.Researchers at Britain's Health Protection Agency (HPA) who published the study in the British Medical Journal said the at least 14-fold increased risk they found had ""implications for the future licensing and use of adjuvanted pandemic vaccines"".Narcolepsy is a life-long disorder and thought to be an autoimmune disease in which patient's immune system attacks the body's own cells. Its symptoms include frequent bouts of daytime sleepiness and in its severe forms it also causes night terrors, hallucinations and cataplexies - when strong emotions trigger a sudden loss of muscle strength.Studies in Finland, Sweden and Ireland have also found a Pandemrix link to narcolepsy, and GSK says more than 800 cases linked to the shot have been reported in Europe.A spokesman for the British drugmaker told Reuters on Wednesday: ""We really want to get to the bottom of this and understand more about the potential role of Pandemrix in the development of narcolepsy.""He added, however, that GSK believes ""the available data are insufficient to assess the likelihood of a causal association between Pandemrix and narcolepsy.""As Reuters reported earlier this month, scientists investigating the link further are homing in on the vaccine's adjuvant, a booster called AS03, and analysing whether its super-charging effect may have played a role.According to the UK results, vaccination with Pandemrix at any time was associated with a 14-fold increased risk of narcolepsy, whereas vaccination within six months before onset of the disease was associated with a 16-fold increased risk.""The increased risk of narcolepsy indicates a causal association,"" said the research team led by Liz Miller, a consultant epidemiologist with the HPA. They added, however, that because of variable delay in diagnosis, the risk may be overestimated because vaccinated children may have been referred to specialist sleep clinics more rapidly.Scientists said the risk translated into around one in 50,000, lower than studies have found in other countries such as Finland and Sweden where Pandemrix was used more widely and the risk was around one in 16,000 to 17,000 children vaccinated.In total, more than 30 million doses of the GSK shot were given in 47 mainly European countries during the H1N1 flu pandemic. It was not used in the United States.The UK study looked at 75 children aged between four and 18 who were diagnosed with narcolepsy from January 2008 and who attended sleep centres across England. Eleven of the children had been vaccinated with Pandemrix before their symptoms began.Finn stressed that Pandemrix is the only vaccine linked to this problem: ""There is nothing to suggest that it occurs after other flu vaccines or vaccines against other diseases.""Narcolepsy is thought to be due to loss of function in cells called hypocretin cells in one of the brain's sleep centres.John Shneerson, a consultant physician from the Respiratory Support and Sleep Centre at Papworth Hospital in Cambridge who co-led the UK study, said Pandemrix may have triggered an immune reaction against those cells, causing narcolepsy in some children who were genetically vulnerable.Experts say around 25 percent of Europeans have a genetic profile making them more susceptible. Narcolepsy has no known cure, but specialist doctors say symptoms can be treated with drug combinations aimed at re-regulating the sleep-wake cycle."
