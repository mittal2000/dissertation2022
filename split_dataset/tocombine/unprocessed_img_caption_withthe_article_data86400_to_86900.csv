Obama met with the House Democratic caucus to discuss his trade agenda. (Photo by Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb9002a1f00003d0225808a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pro-democracy forces won a big victory Friday when they stalled the top-secret Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement backed by the White House and the Republican leadership in Congress. But it's only Round One. The unholy trio of Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (who has vowed to keep any of Obama's nominees from being confirmed), Speaker of the House John Boehner (who has thwarted just about every Democratic legislative proposal of the past several years), and President Obama (a Democrat, in case you are having trouble remembering) are as one in a desperate effort to rescue their Frankenstein-like creation. Their only hope is to bribe, browbeat, or brainwash enough House members to change their minds. It could happen. The journalist John R. MacArthur, writing late last week in the Providence Journal, tells how New York Democrat Kathleen Rice flip-flopped. Not long ago, she opposed fast-tracking the Trans-Pacific Partnership because she worried it would not ""protect her district's working families."" As well she might; this agreement is everything the giant corporations want; it decidedly wasn't written with working people in mind. But last week, Rep. Rice suddenly stopped worrying about those workers and went over to the other side, voting in favor of fast-tracking one of the most massive giveaways to multinational companies ever -- including corporations that have been shipping jobs overseas and pocketing their swollen off-shore profits to avoid taxes.  How in the world could Rice betray her working-class constituents, the people who trusted her to look after their interests? What changed her mind? For one thing, the president assured turncoats like Rice that he would ""have their back"" if he had their votes. We can't know what that means, writes John MacArthur, ""because the political deals that grease the way for unpopular legislation aren't ordinarily announced in press releases or high-minded op-eds. The nasty facts tend to come out later, after the damage has been done.""   For now, we can only rub our eyes at the spectacle. Look at this headline in The Washington Post after Democrats defeated the Obama-McConnell-Boehner-Republican cabal on Friday: ""New questions arise about House Democratic caucus's loyalty to Obama.""Say what? Shouldn't that headline read: ""New questions arise about president's loyalty to House Democratic caucus?"" Obama often has treated Democrats in Congress as if they've been quarantined for Ebola; they're more likely to get into the White House if they dress up on Halloween as Republicans and go trick-or-treating at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.But now the President demands they play on his side, with McConnell and Boehner as co-captains. The evening before the big vote he showed up at the congressional baseball game, hoping his presence would inspire some last-inning runs during Friday's showdown. Republicans at the game reportedly cheered when the president arrived, while Democrats looked on in surprise at the unexpected appearance of their often furtive ""leader."" So now the President and his sworn enemies are allied in a bizarre mutual embrace of voodoo economics, assuring us that what's good for multinational giants is good for struggling Americans trying to pay their bills while waiting below for the benefits of ""free trade"" to trickle down.As The New York Times reported, corporate America has been nearly unanimous in its support of the trade agreement. No surprise: their lobbyists and lawyers practically wrote it. And on Friday their CEOs were loud and clear in voicing their displeasure over the impudence of the House in defying them. The National Association of Manufacturers, among others, declared that manufacturers ""will not back down in this fight for expanded trade, for the future of our industry and our country."" Ah, yes, that's the argument: What's good for global giants is good for workers. Yet we're left to wonder at Rep. Rice's motive for her turnaround when it betrays the working folk that only a bit earlier she was defending.The promise of these trade agreements is at best an illusion, at worst, a lie -- as we learned after the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) more than 20 years ago. The treaty and the devastation of jobs that followed would not have happened without House Democratic Majority Leader Richard Gephardt. For 28 years, he represented a working-class district in St. Louis. Then he flipped. He supported fast-track for NAFTA and helped clear the way for passage of fast-track by negotiating with the first President Bush, John R. MacArthur writes, ""to insert labor and environmental standards into future negotiations with Mexico and Canada."" But nothing enforceable for workers or the environment ever emerged from those negotiations. It was a hollow promise. Gephardt, wound up voting against the final treaty, but the damage was done and he left Congress to become one of the top corporate lobbyists in Washington; among his clients has been that great friend of the working class, Goldman Sachs. How many votes cast for the trade deal last Friday came from politicians aware of the prospective job opportunities waiting on the other side of that infamous revolving door? Or are we just getting too cynical? The issue before us is not ""free trade,"" which, like any policy, has its pluses and minuses. The issue is that a multilateral trade agreement should not be negotiated in secret, but in the open by our State and Commerce departments, with input from all organizations concerned, including those representing workers and environmentalists.Then there should come a draft document for all to see, to be laid before the people's representatives in Congress assembled. If and when a majority of them ratifies the agreement, it can go to the president for signature. This is how democracy should work.Yet it's the precise opposite of how this agreement has come to be. We are being asked to believe that the administration can argue with a straight face for a deal conceived in secrecy, drafted largely by corporate mercenaries, kept from public and Congressional view except with burdensome restrictions, then presented to Congress for a vote up or down, neither debate nor amendment allowed. It's an absolute parody of the process described in the Constitution.And where, oh where, are the ""strict constructionists"" on the Republican side? What happened to their proclaimed reverence for every syllable of the Constitution, their insistence that each must be interpreted precisely as understood in 1789? Instead we are told that we must put aside principle and common sense on the pretended grounds that in the changing world of global economics, it is a necessary procedure. That's bull -- the same nonsense used to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act during the Clinton administration: the word went forth that in a modern economy, controls and regulations were obsolete remnants of a different era, standing in the way of universal prosperity.As we learned, that fallacious and duplicitous argument led to a windfall for Wall Street bankers who subsequently had to be bailed out by taxpayers, only to survive and return to their predatory habits in this ""modern economy."" This whole affair is outrageous. After 226 years of constitutional government, is this where we've finally arrived? So what can we do against so monstrous a lie? First, call this deal out for what it is -- an abomination. Then let the tsunami of popular outrage roll. Tell Congress and the White House what you think. But hurry! Time's running out, and Obama, McConnell, Boehner and the lobbyists are working overtime to get the locomotive back on the fast-track."
1,MEDIA,Clinton Campaign Denies Access To Daily Mail Pool Reporter In Latest Dispute With Press,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-daily-mail_n_7585302.html,,2015-06-15,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Rodham Clinton speaks to supporters during a rally, Sunday, June 14, 2015, in Des Moines, Iowa. Clinton's campaign has signaled Iowa will be the centerpiece of its ground game. (AP Photo/Charlie Neibergall)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5c8721f0000df00248165.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign prohibited a Daily Mail journalist from covering its Monday event in Manchester, New Hampshire, as the designated print pool reporter, marking the latest spat with the press over access. McClatchy's Anita Kumar tweeted that Clinton's press vans left for the event without Daily Mail U.S. Political Editor David Martosko, who was scheduled to cover it and provide a pool report to journalists unable to attend because of space limitations. The Clinton traveling press corps, like the White House Correspondents' Association, has established a pool rotation for campaign events that can't accommodate large numbers of journalists. Traditionally, journalists, rather than the campaign or administration being covered, decide who serves as pool reporter for the group. So journalists unsurprisingly took issue with the campaign's decision. ""Memo to the Clinton campaign: pools control themselves,"" tweeted Time's Zeke Miller.The Daily Mail, in its own story on the incident, suggested that Clinton spokesman Nick Merrill gave multiple reasons for Martosko's exclusion, contradicting himself in the effort to provide the campaign's rationale. First, the story said, Merrill suggested the U.K.-based outlet couldn't participate because it was a foreign news organization. But the Daily Mail is part of the 14-member traveling press pool covering Clinton, along with The Guardian and Agence France-Presse, both foreign outlets. Merrill later argued that the Daily Mail was barred because it wasn't part of the regular White House press pool, according to the article. But Martosko informed Merrill that the Daily Mail's White House correspondent has a hard pass to cover the White House and that it was only because of a timing issue that the outlet hasn't yet been added to the regular rotation.""We have been working to create an equitable system, and have had some concerns expressed by foreign outlets about not being a part of the rotation,"" Merrill said in a statement to The Huffington Post. ""The journalists who coordinate the pool are in touch with them as are we, and we simply asked that until we can work all of that out that we send an outlet in keeping with previous precedents.""In a separate email, Merrill said the campaign ""want[s] a happy press corps as much as the press corps does"" and works ""very hard to achieve that in tandem with them.""""It's a long campaign,"" he continued, ""and we are going to do our best to find equilibrium and best accommodate interest from as many news outlets as possible, given the space limitations of our events.”Merill's response echoes the one he gave to HuffPost earlier this month after a group of journalists  met privately to discuss grievances over access to the campaign. Merrill said at the time that the campaign wants ""a happy press corps as much as the press corps does"" and also noted that ""it's a long campaign."" Last week, two top Clinton campaign officials met with representatives from the press corps to try and hash out their differences. The recent issues over access and pooling events have played out amid frustration about Clinton not giving any interviews for the first two months of her campaign. However, she spoke this past weekend to a couple of Iowa journalists, ending the interview drought. UPDATE: 9:15 p.m. -- The Clinton traveling press pool issued a statement Monday night responding to the campaign denying access to the designated pool reporter:""We would like to see all campaign events open to the public and the full press corps, but when that is not possible we have agreed to pool coverage. We haven't yet had a clear explanation about why the pool reporter for today's events was denied access. But any attempt by the campaign to dictate who is in the pool is unacceptable. The pool is open to any print organization willing to take part."" The pool is comprised of AFP. Boston Globe, BuzzFeed, Daily Mail, Financial Times, Guardian, McClatchy, New York Daily News, New York Times, Politico, Time, Tribune Publishing, Wall Street Journal, and Washington Post. "

Instead he blamed creditors for Sunday's breakdown of the cash-for-reform talks, the biggest setback in long-running negotiations to unlock aid. He said his government had a responsibility to defend Greece's dignity and would resist demands for further pension cuts.""It is not a matter of ideological stubbornness. It has to do with democracy,"" said the 40-year-old leftist, who was elected on a pledge to end austerity.Athens now has just two weeks to find a way out of the impasse before it faces a 1.6 billion euro repayment due to the International Monetary Fund, potentially leaving it out of cash, unable to borrow and dangling on the edge of the currency area.Germany and other creditor nations demanded that Athens come to its senses and offer new proposals.""It won't work that Greece sets the terms and says 'everyone has to dance to our tune'. Greece needs to get back to reality,"" Volker Kauder, parliamentary floor leader of Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives, told ARD television.Belgian Finance Minister Johan Van Overtveldt said the euro zone's credibility would be damaged and radical forces in other countries emboldened if past accords with Greece were changed.The European Commission said it would only resume mediation efforts if Greece put forward new proposals, while the Greek government spokesman said Athens was sticking to its rejection of wage and pension cuts and higher taxes on basic goods.""We have largely exhausted our limits,"" spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis said. Tsipras' office said Greece was ready to restart talks at any time and was waiting for a signal from lenders which could loosen the deadlock.""If they call us with something new, we may also provide something new,"" one official said.A Greek government official denied a German newspaper report that said there were plans for Greece to impose capital controls this weekend if the talks fail. A German government spokesman could not confirm the report.Despite the deepening crisis, Tsipras is going ahead with a planned visit to Russia from Thursday, the day euro zone finance ministers hold a crucial meeting to review the standoff with Greece. He is due to stay till Saturday, attend an economic forum in Saint Petersburg and meet President Vladimir Putin.EU officials said that without improved Greek proposals by Thursday, the Eurogroup session would be very tough and was likely to present Greece with an ultimatum.""No more new proposals; take it or leave it time is upon us, I think. Or very close."" one euro zone official said.While there was little outward sign of panic in Athens as Greeks held out hope for a last-minute solution - a familiar theme in five years of crisis - the latest impasse triggered a selloff in European and Asian shares and weighed on the euro.Greek banks suffered deposit outflows of about 400 million euros ($449 million) on Monday as the pace of daily withdrawals picked up from last week, bankers said.European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said the ECB would keep approving emergency lending to Greek banks as long as they remained solvent but would monitor closely whether they had sufficient collateral.Draghi stressed in testimony to the European Parliament it was up to elected politicians, not to central bankers, to decide on Greece's fate and the ECB could not allow its liquidity to be used illegally to finance the Greek government.""While all actors will now need to go the extra mile, the ball lies squarely in the camp of the Greek government to take the necessary steps,"" Draghi said. FIRST CONTAGIONGlobal financial markets suffered the first bout of serious contagion from the Greek crisis this year. The premium investors demand to hold Spanish, Italian and Portuguese government bonds over low-risk German Bunds hit a 2015 high.Greek stocks fell 5.3 percent, while banking stocks tumbled more than 10 percent. Two-year government bond yields surged more than 3 percentage points to 29.02 percent.A Reuters poll of euro money market traders put the chances of Greece leaving the euro zone this year at nearly one-in-three, higher than predicted just a month ago.""We should work out an emergency plan because Greece would fall into a state of emergency,"" German EU commissioner Guenther Oettinger said. ""Energy supplies, pay for police officials, medical supplies, and pharmaceutical products and much more"" needed to be ensured.Tsipras will brief Syriza lawmakers on the negotiations at 1 p.m. (1000 GMT) on Tuesday after meeting Stavros Theodorakis, leader of the center-left To Potami party and the newly appointed head of Pasok, Fofi Gennimata.Gennimata, an ex-minister and daughter of a former senior official in the Socialist party which once dominated Greek politics, was elected as president by the party on Sunday.Tsipras blamed ""political expediency"" on the part of lenders for the impasse and their insistence on new cuts in pensions ""after five years of looting under the bailouts.""Exasperated by what it sees as Greek distortion of the creditors' proposals, the European Commission made public for the first time comprehensive details of the plan, denying that the lenders were demanding specific pension or wage cuts.Spokeswoman Annika Breidthardt said Greece and the three institutions - the IMF, Commission and ECB - had agreed on budget surplus targets before debt service for the coming years, but not on what Greece needed to do to achieve those goals.The lenders called for annual savings of 1 percentage point of gross domestic product on pension spending, equivalent to 2 billion euros a year, while Athens only offered 71 million, or 0.04 percent, she said.""The targets have already been lowered .. It's not a one-way street,"" Breidthardt said.Greece says years of austerity have only made its situation worse by shrinking the economy, making it harder to pay off debt. Tsipras insists that debt relief must be part of any deal.The creditors argue Greece must reform its pensions system to put state finances on a sustainable footing. Greek workers retire younger on average than in other European countries and collect pensions close to German levels that require unaffordable government subsidies, they contend.""Why insist on pensions? Pensions and wages account for about 75 percent of primary spending; the other 25 percent have already been cut to the bone,"" IMF chief economist Olivier Blanchard wrote in a blog post.""Just as there is a limit to what Greece can do, there is a limit to how much financing and debt relief official creditors are willing and realistically able to provide given that they have their own taxpayers to consider.""The prospect of elections or a referendum to give Tsipras a face-saving way out of the crisis made a comeback in the Greek debate as the premier faced calls from the opposition to secure a deal to avert an economic collapse.Although some economists still believe that, as in past crises, a last-minute fix will be found to avoid default, European politicians sound more determined than before to resist compromising with demands they consider unreasonable.Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis retorted in an interview with Germany's Bild newspaper that a deal could be reached quickly if Merkel took part in the talks.""I rule out a 'Grexit' as a sensible solution,"" Varoufakis said. ""But no one can rule out everything. I can't even rule out a comet hitting Earth.""

3,FIFTY,Why Cincinnati's Library Once Collected Snails,"Steven Rosen, ContributorArts/culture writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-cincinnatis-library-once-collected-snails_b_7585606.html,"The idea for this story started, innocently enough, with a short article in the current issue of LibraryLinks, the newsletter of The Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County.",2015-06-15,2015-06-15-1434377149-1617542-GENJimMainger001a.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-15-1434377149-1617542-GENJimMainger001a-thumb.jpg,"The idea for this story started, innocently enough, with a short article in the current issue of LibraryLinks, the newsletter of The Public Library of Cincinnati and Hamilton County.Rather innocuously headlined ""Library donations from the early 1900s,"" it noted that the library back then received ""several donations that might seem a little unexpected by today's standards.""How unexpected? The library's annual Administrative Reports from 1901-1905 listed: one snail, one tadpole, a ticket to the Opera House, one Egyptian figurine, more snails, an aquarium and three goldfish, the Declaration of Independence, an exhibit of cocoa, shells, cotton specimens, beetles, butterflies, moths, slate, pampas grass, an oriole's nest, four Indian arrowheads and -- strangest of all -- rat skins.Alas, the article didn't explain why anyone would want to donate, say, a snail or a rat skin to a library, so it left an unanswered question: A hundred years ago, was the concept of a public library different than it is today? Was it also a kind of natural history museum or zoo where the task of collecting included far more than just books?I'd written before about some of the other ephemera collected by Cincinnati's library, like restaurant menus and sheet music. But those were printed material. Somewhere in the stacks, were there also collections of beetles and butterflies?So I made an inquiry. I was not expecting the seriousness and thoroughness with which reference librarian James Mainger, 58, of the Main Library's Genealogy & Local History Department, took on the assignment.His findings, backed up with excerpts from period reports to the (head) librarian from that time, proved very illuminating. They show that the concept of progressivism -- trying new things -- in library outreach goes back at least a century here.Librarians were innovative in ways to lure children into reading, especially children who maybe weren't exposed to books at home.That explains the strange donations, Mainger believes. In his email, which I have edited for space and other considerations, he explained his reasoning:""The only mention of displays or exhibits of natural objects in these [Administrative] Reports comes from the Children's Department. The donations of snails, goldfish with aquaria, rat skins, etc. suggest that they were for children's programs. The Children's Department had only just opened in 1900, and the librarians thought that real objects would help in keeping the children interested while they were oriented toward books and reading.""The library annual reports prior to 1900 show no similar donations of natural objects, [so] I'm not seeing evidence in these reports that the library sought to offer a miniature natural history museum. The librarians appear to be solidly into literacy and book reading.""Looking at the donation lists in the annual reports one discovers that the 'odd' non-book donations given to the Library for those years were scattered among hundreds of book donations and make up just a very small fraction.""Indeed, Mainger pointed out that the 16 donations listed in the current LibraryLinks represented the entirety of such unusual non-book items for the years 1901-1905.Further illuminating were the excerpts Mainger provided from Children's Department reports during those years. They offer a compelling glimpse into life for Cincinnati children, especially the impoverished or working-class ones, at the turn of the 20th century.For instance, Emma Butler, a Children's Room employee, told about activities of said room in 1903, when exhibits on quartz and fur were offered to attract more children: ""At the noon hour, the room has been crowded with boys who work in the surrounding factories and business houses,"" she wrote in the reports.She also addressed home libraries -- a radical example of outreach. ""The main object of the home libraries is to put books in the hands of children who are either too young to come to the central library or do not know of its existence,"" the report explained.""First a visitor must be secured, then a clean and suitable room in which the meetings may be held, and finally ten children must be gathered from the house if the place of meeting be in a tenement, or from the immediate neighborhood.""This article started off like it would be funny, or at least offbeat. But, ultimately, it's poignant to realize the efforts made to reach and engage young readers who needed it.(A slightly different version of this story ran in Cincinnati CityBeat on 63-15) Photo of James Mainger provided by Public Library of Cincinnati & Hamilton County, Ohio.)"

He's not the wiser brother.Didn't Jeb get better grades in school? If only grades mattered. It reminded me of what Henry Kissinger allegedly once said of Zbigniew Brzezinski, Jimmy Carter's National Security Adviser: ""He is smart but not wise.""Most of us became aware of Jeb's shortcomings when he ran for Florida governor. It was the biggest GOP year ever. Yet Jeb Bush managed to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory, dropping a close one to incumbent Governor Lawton Chiles.Jeb tried to show off his so-called political smarts in a debate, rattling off an answer on trade policy in Spanish, and then condescendingly offered to translate it into English. Chiles quickly quipped, ""I'm going to reply to that in 'Cracker.'"" He added, ""Do you understand 'Cracker'?""Bush lost the election. Some say it's because Florida is a more moderate state, but in that election, other Republicans fared well in the Sunshine State, including freshman Senator Connie Mack III, who blew out Hillary Clinton's brother, Hugh Rodham. Others claim that Jeb Bush didn't have a Karl Rove. But I doubt even Rove could help the overconfident and often indecisive Jeb Bush.Meanwhile, George W. Bush seemed more comfortable in political settings, keeping things short and simple. Sure, he made all kinds of errors in decisions, but he stayed confident, which gave you the sense that you knew what he was doing. Jeb, on the other hand, waffled so quickly and frequently that you became convinced he didn't know what to do or say.Take the immigration debate, for example. Before 2013, Jeb was always a supporter of immigration reform, to the point of criticizing Mitt Romney for not adopting his moderate tone. Then he published a book adopting Romney's self-deportation plan. When critics decried Jeb's flip-flop, he amazingly changed course again. He's also criticizing opponents for changing their views on immigration policy.It's the same with the Iraq War and single-motherhood issues. Jeb was the only GOP presidential candidate who defended George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq, and then, once he was criticized by everyone else, he changed his tune to claim that the war was a mistake. When someone unearthed a book Jeb had written in 1995 calling for shaming single mothers, he defended his comments. Then, after the predictable outcry, he changed his story and said he no longer supports those views and has evolved his thinking on the subject. I have no idea what his policy on either subject is.It was a similar roller-coaster ride for eight years when Jeb Bush was in office. He won two races, but his opponents were a bland lieutenant governor and a political neophyte. Neither win was a blowout. After he left office in January 2007, he went to work as a consultant for Lehman Brothers. Ouch. Jeb Bush went from a lead in the 2016 Republican primary to being mired near the middle. And that's a wise decision that the GOP primary voters are making in backing away from the so-called ""smart"" Bush. There's time for Jeb to recover, but he'll need the wisdom of Solomon to do so.John A. Tures is a professor of political science at LaGrange College in LaGrange, Georgia.

But when the Houthi rebels made a daring military move in February 2015 and managed to take over the capital Sanaa, forcing President Abd Rabbuh Mansur Hadi to flee, the Saudi government decided to intervene to restore Hadi to power.On March 26, 2015, the Saudis, under the umbrella of the Gulf Cooperation Council, launched a vicious airstrike campaign against the Houthis. Instead of unseating the Houthis, Saudi interference only escalated the conflict, killing over 2,000 Yemenis and creating a humanitarian crisis that have left 80% of the population in dire need of aid. The heavy military intervention has destroyed homes, businesses, schools, hospitals, and entire villages. Civilians lack basic supplies such as food, water, medicine, and adequate shelter. Doctors Without Borders reports that many people living in frontline areas are unable to travel to clinics or hospitals for medical care both because of the fighting and the lack of fuel. Even those who are able to make it to health facilities often find that they are not functioning.Officially known as Ansar Allah (Partisans of God), the Houthi movement began in the 1990s, initially advocating for sectarian tolerance and peace. But motivated by unemployment, poverty and opposition to what they perceived as a corrupt and inept government, they took up armed rebellion.President Hadi, who requested help from the Saudis to crush the Houthis, had come to power in February 2012 after an ""Arab Spring"" uprising against 35-year ruler Ali Abdullah Saleh. Hadi got his position through an election where he was the only candidate, and it was only supposed to be a two-year term ending in February 2014, when new elections were to be held. Hadi actually resigned from his post in January 2015. So for many Yemenis, Hadi is no longer a legitimate president and he had no legal right to ask the Saudis to intervene.Even Yemenis who supported the Saudi intervention, thinking it would quickly bring an end to the fighting, changed their minds when they witnessed the civilian deaths, the destruction of the nation's infrastructure, the blocking of the airports and seaports, and the general chaos that has ensued. Part of that chaos is that to fight the Saudis, the Houthis made an alliance of convenience with the former president Ali Abdullah Saleh (the very man who used to bomb them) and fighters loyal to him, while other parts of the military and local militias have joined the side of Hadi.Most devastating has been the relentless Saudi bombing. When a temporary ceasefire agreement was reached in early May, the Saudis deliberately inflicted as much violence as possible before the ceasefire began and once the ceasefire ended, they promptly reengaged in their strikes.According to two recent Human Rights Watch investigations, among the weapons being used by the Saudis are cluster bombs, which were banned by the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions because they kill civilians long after the fighting has stopped. Of the three types of cluster munitions identified recently in Yemen, two were manufactured in the United States and supplied by the U.S. government. ""The Saudi-led coalition and other warring parties in Yemen need to recognize that using banned cluster munitions is harming civilians,"" said Human Rights Watch researcher Ole Solvang. ""These weapons can't distinguish military targets from civilians, and their unexploded submunitions threaten civilians, especially children, even long after the fighting.""The fighting in Yemen is not just destroying the fabric of that nation; it has broader implications for the region. While Iran denies direct involvement, it gives military aid to the Houthis, supports them politically and strongly condemns the Saudi intervention in Yemen.The United States and the European Union have weighed in on the side of the Saudis, helping with intelligence sharing, targeted assistance, and advisory and logistical support. This may have a negative influence on the Iran nuclear talks, with hardliners in Iran using Yemen as an example of why it's impossible to have a rapprochement with the West.Another negative side effect of the conflict is that it has strengthened the radical Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). AQAP considers the Houthis, who are Shias, heretics, and the Houthis have been fighting AQAP for years. The present situation gives AQAP more breathing space, and effectively -- in this battle -- puts the Saudis and the U.S. on the same side as AQAP, the very force that has been the target of U.S. drone strikes. To make matters even worse, the present constellation of forces has opened the doors for new radical players to emerge -- ISIS. In fact, ISIS made its bloody debut in Yemen on March 20, when it attacked a Shia mosque in a pro-Houthi area, killing about 130 people.The June UN-brokered peace talks are a long shot, but a critical effort to quell the violence. Initially, the Houthis had called for a ceasefire as a precondition to the talks, while Hadi's precondition was the withdrawal of the Houthis from the areas they seized. UN negotiators convinced both sides to come to the table without preconditions. They hope the talks will result in a ceasefire, increased delivery of humanitarian aid and a withdrawal plan for the Houthis. But it's certainly not clear that the Saudis, who will not be at the talks, will agree to stop their intervention.Meanwhile, for ordinary Yemenis, they can only hope that a miracle happens in Geneva so they can start to rebuild their shattered lives.Nalini Ramachandran is a student at Northeastern University studying International Affairs and Middle East Studies.

Now, however, a Maryland disc jockey service may have to face the music, after the company co-owner says he refused to provide entertainment for a gay man's birthday party because it would go against his faith. The Washington Post reports that Dani Tsakounis and her brother, Tom, attempted to hire Ultrasound Deejays for a birthday party they are hosting for their 60-year-old roommate, who is openly gay. Michael Lampiris, who is the co-owner of Ultrasound Deejays and also a disc jockey, told Tsakounis that he would not provide the music because her brother is married to another man and their roommate is also gay. “I just said, ‘We won’t be able to do it, we’re a Christian organization and it would go against our faith, I’m sorry,’” Lampiris told the publication. The ""family friendly"" company, which Lampiris founded in the 1980s, reportedly has a written company policy which states, ""we will not be involved in any event involving homosexual celebration or activity. We follow biblical morality.""On its website, the company notes, ""We will not play music that is vulgar or profane or engage in any lewd displays of 'entertaining.'"" Per the company policy posted to their website, Ultrasound Deejays will not be involved with parties that celebrate Halloween, feature ""provocative dancing"" or include ""fortune tellers, psychics, or magicians."" Since 2001, Maryland has banned discrimination based on sexual orientation in public accommodation, which applies to businesses “offering goods, services, entertainment."" But Lampiris told The Washington Post he had never heard of a law forbidding that type of discrimination. He added that he's turned down similar requests, including a wedding with a bridal party that included several lesbians, because of his beliefs. ""To me, it would be like a synagogue having to cater to a neo-Nazi party or black DJ having to do a KKK dance,"" he said, noting that it's ultimately ""a conscience thing.""Tom Tsakounis, meanwhile, has registered a complaint with the Montgomery County Human Rights Commission. The incident, he said, ""made me feel like I got hit in the stomach. You feel like: 'C'mon, in my neighborhood?' But: Wow, yes -- in my neighborhood."""

Cucumbers are probably my number one ""go-to"" vegetable. Sometimes when I am not in the mood to make a whole salad, I will slice up some cucumbers (my favorite actually are the little Persian ones), watermelon radish (if you haven't tried these, seek them out - they are delicious!) and peeled kohlrabi and sprinkle them with some Ume (Plum) Vinegar with a couple of drops of toasted sesame oil. This recipe is mainly raw; You can make it fully raw by leaving out the toasted sesame oil and switching to apple cider vinegar. You can substitute the sunflower seed oil with any other oil that you prefer, but I'd recommend staying away from a heavier oil, like EVOO as that might take over the flavors. I used coconut sugar as my sweetener, but feel free to experiment with others such as honey, stevia, xylitol or coconut nectar. The coconut sugar gives it a nice bright finish but it also makes the noodles darker in color.For the noodles, source out English cucumbers. These are the longer, thinner ones that are usually hot-house grown. I tried using the more conventional type, but they have a lot more seeds and make the noodles quite soupy. Another option is to half a conventional cucumber and scoop out the seeds before spiralizing. You can even use some of the seeds in the dressing. If you don't have a spiralizer, you can use a peeler or mandoline and make flat noodles that way.  Sweet and Sour Cucumber NoodlesServes 2-3Ingredients: 2 English cucumbers 1 lime 3-4 TB. Coconut sugar 3 TB. sunflower oil 1.5 TB. white vinegar 3 TB. rice vinegar 1/4 tsp. toasted sesame oil (optional) 1 small garlic clove (or 1/4 tsp. powdered) 1 small piece of shallot 1 small piece of ginger (or 1/8 tsp.) 1/4 tsp. sea salt (or more, to taste) 2-3 tsp. sesame seeds (raw or toasted) 1/4 cup chopped cilantro 1 tsp. crushed red pepper flakes Optional: 1 tsp. chopped dill or a sprig to garnishDirections: Peel the cucumbers loosely (leaving some green for contrast) and slice off the ends. Cut into 1-2 inch pieces and spiralize. You can also create flat noodles with a peeler or mandoline. Place noodles in colander to drain as they will be quite watery. You can also blot them with a paper towel and squeeze out the moisture.Using a microplane grate the ginger and shallot over a mixing bowl. You can chop them finely or use powdered but I like the texture of them this way. Add the rest of the ingredients to the bowl, up to the sesame seeds. I actually put these in my Nutri-Bullet to blend everything together as the coconut sugar is somewhat grainy, but you can just whisk it all vigorously. Taste and adjust seasonings. Place the cucumber noodles in a bowl and toss with the dressing adding the sesame seeds and cilantro. Cover bowl and refrigerate for several hours. Before serving garnishing with the crushed red pepper flakes, dill or other favorites.Make these earlier in the day and allow the flavors to marry and intensify by covering and refrigerating for several hours. You can spice up the mixture by adding chopped dill or jalapeno peppers, or add a teaspoon of sriracha to the dressing. I'm going to try that next.LindaJoy Rose, Ph.D. aka Dr. L J is the founder of the Natural Wellness Academy and the pioneer of the Raw Fusion movement, blending the incredible health benefits of raw foods with the comfort and convenience of mainstream meals.

But for most of us, growing forgetfulness is little more than a natural reaction to information overload.Our brains are simply not wired to process the vast amount of information and choices we are exposed to these days--and the impossible effort to do so can lead to indecisiveness, bad decisions and stress, according to Lucy Jo Palladino, Ph.D., a psychologist and author of Find Your Focus Zone.Information overload can also tempt us to tune out or simply slide across the surface of life -- like a water strider on a pond, robbed of the pleasure of a place to land. So what genuinely helps people navigate this Information Age (which, perhaps not coincidentally, has also been called the Age of Anxiety?)There are lots of suggestions out there in publications such as, Fast Company, Forbes and Aeon. Many discuss the dangers of email and multitasking and the value of daydreaming, taking breaks, going for walks, writing things down, and doing the most important things first. Daniel Goleman also recently wrote about the topic in Focus: The Hidden Driver of Excellence, in which he explores the benefits of mindfulness meditation, focused preparation and recovery, positive emotions and connections, and mental ""prosthetics.""As someone who has an insatiable desire to know and do everything, I've also come to find three insights particularly helpful. Rather than concrete actions, they serve more as mindsets or perspectives to take on all that is available to us now -- and stay centered on what truly matters to us as individuals.What's new is not (necessarily) important. In a recent interview on Krista Tippett's podcast, On Being, Maria Popova, the creator of Brain Pickings, observed that the way information comes to us today via the Internet constantly reinforces the idea that what is new is what is important and valuable. But this, of course, is not true. Much of what is delivered up as new is neither important nor valuable. To the contrary, it can be a great distraction from what is meaningful -- which is often old, timeless, contained in books, in music, in art, and in the hearts and souls of human beings who need only the expanse of quiet, leisure, stillness, and each other to bring their wisdom to life. Put another way: It helps to remember that trying to keep up with what is new is not necessarily what's most likely to make you happy, healthy, or successful.Sensitivity to other people's expectations can spin you in circles. Being overly influenced by other people's expectations can make us vulnerable to being reactive instead of deliberate; and those of us who are sensitive to other people's expectations need to figure out how to manage that. When I was growing up, for example, my father on more than one occasion became furious at me for reading a book rather than volunteering to help around the house. While he clearly did not remember what it was like to be a kid or enjoy himself, his reaction had an impact on me. And to this day, I need to remind myself to be conscious of my motivations before I act so I do not unconsciously relinquish the reins of my life to the helter-skelter whims of others.Focusing on what makes you feel like you is the best guide there is. Like most writers, I have spent a lot of time living a dual existence: ""professional"" by day, and ""writer"" by any early or late hour I have to myself. I am fortunate that I am adept at my professional work, I enjoy it, and I find it meaningful. But when I think it is me, instead of what I do, I tend to lose my focus--and, often, lots of things start to go wrong. But when I am know that I am a writer first--because that is where I feel most fully me--I make smarter decisions, my energy flows more smoothly, and things tend to go better in my working life, my writing life, and my personal life. I can look at the information that comes my way and not feel overly reactive and spun about by distractions because I am acting from what I can only describe as the core of my being.In short, it comes down to those familiar words: Know yourself -- and then trust yourself. It is as simple and remarkable as that.(This post appeared in an earlier version at http://lisabennett.org/blog/ Photo credit: AlmaArte Photography.)"

Eisenhower waves to confetti-tossing crowds lining the parade route to Detroit's City Hall, June 14, 1952, where he made a non-political Flag Day address. A mammoth flag, said to be the largest American flag in the world, covers the front of a large department store in the background. Man in the front of the car is unidentified. (AP Photo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e69186b230000781839f7cf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Today is Flag Day. On June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress passed a resolution ""that the flag of the thirteen United States shall be thirteen stripes of alternate red and white, with a union of thirteen stars of white on a blue field, representing the new constellation"". In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson issued a proclamation establishing a nationwide observance of Flag Day on June 14. But it didn't become an official celebration until 1949 -- at the start of the Cold War -- when Congress passed legislation and President Harry Truman signed it into law. It is not federal holiday when banks and public offices shut down. It is meant, instead, to encourage Americans to display Old Glory outside of their homes and businesses as a way to express their patriotism. But the ways we do so are as diverse as our nation. To some, patriotism means ""my country -- right or wrong."" To others, it means loyalty to a set of principles, and thus requires dissent and criticism when those in power violate those standards. As Martin Luther King said in a speech during the Montgomery bus boycott in 1955, ""the great glory of American democracy is the right to protest for right.""Former President George W. Bush expressed the first version, questioning the patriotism of anyone who challenged his war on terrorism. In his 2001 State of the Union address, for example, Bush claimed, ""You're either with us, or with the terrorists."" He introduced the Patriot Act to codify this view, giving the government new powers to suppress dissent. (The anti-war movement countered with bumper stickers illustrated with an American flag that proclaimed ""Peace is Patriotic."")In contrast, President Barack Obama has said: I have no doubt that, in the face of impossible odds, people who love their country can change it."" He observed that, ""Loving your country shouldn't just mean watching fireworks on the Fourth of July. Loving your country must mean accepting your responsibility to do your part to change it. If you do, your life will be richer, our country will be stronger.The flag, as a symbol of the nation, is not owned by the administration in power, but by the people. We battle over what it means, but all Americans -- across the political spectrum -- have an equal right to claim the flag as their own.Progressives understand that people can disagree with their government and still love their country and its ideals.Indeed, throughout U.S. history, many American radicals and progressive reformers have proudly asserted their patriotism. To them, America stood for basic democratic values -- economic and social equality, mass participation in politics, free speech and civil liberties, elimination of the second-class citizenship of women and racial minorities, a welcome mat for the world's oppressed people. The reality of corporate power, right-wing xenophobia, and social injustice only fueled progressives' allegiance to these principles and the struggle to achieve them.Most Americans are unaware that much of our patriotic culture -- including many of the leading symbols and songs -- was created by people with decidedly progressive sympathies.For example, the Pledge of Allegiance was authored and promoted by Francis Bellamy, a leading Christian socialist. Bellamy penned the Pledge of Allegiance in 1892 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of Christopher Columbus' discovery of America by promoting use of the flag in public schools.It was the Gilded Age, an era of major political and social conflict. Reformers were outraged by the widening gap between rich and poor, and the behavior of corporate robber barons who were exploiting workers, gouging consumers, and corrupting politics with their money. Workers were organizing unions. Farmers joined forces in the Populist movement to leash the power of banks, railroads, and utility companies. Progressive reformers fought for child labor laws, against slum housing, and in favor of women's suffrage. Radicals were gaining new converts.In foreign affairs, Americans were battling over the nation's role in the world. America was beginning to act like an imperial power, justifying its expansion with a combination of white supremacy, manifest destiny, and spreading democracy. At the time, nativist groups in the North and Midwest as well as the South were pushing for restrictions on immigrants -- Catholics, Jews, and Asians -- deemed to be polluting Protestant America. In the South, the outcome of the Civil War still inflamed regional passions. Many Southerners, including Civil War veterans, swore allegiance to the Confederate flag.Bellamy (cousin of best-selling radical writer Edward Bellamy) believed that unbridled capitalism, materialism, and individualism betrayed America's promise. He hoped the Pledge of Allegiance would promote a different moral vision to counter the rampant greed he thought was undermining the nation. Bellamy initially intended to use the phrase ""liberty, fraternity and equality,"" but concluded that the radical rhetoric of the French Revolution wouldn't sit well with many Americans. So he coined the phrase, ""one nation indivisible with liberty and justice for all,"" intending it to express a more egalitarian vision of America, a secular patriotism to help unite a divided nation.By 1924, the National Flag Conference, led by the American Legion and the Daughters of the American Revolution, changed the Pledge's words, ""my Flag,"" to ""the Flag of the United States of America,"" despite Francis Bellamy's opposition. In 1954, as the Cold War against the Soviet Union (and its atheistic Communism) intensified, the Knights of Columbus led a campaign to add the phrase ""under God"" to the Pledge. Congress agreed and on Flag Day that year, President Dwight Eisenhower signed the law to include those two words. Consider the lines inscribed on the Statue of Liberty, written by Emma Lazarus: ""Give me your tired, your poor/Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free."" Laxarus was a poet of considerable reputation in her day, who was a strong supporter of Henry George and his ""socialistic"" single-tax program, and a friend of William Morris, a leading British socialist. Her welcome to the ""wretched refuse"" of the earth, written in 1883, was an effort to project an inclusive and egalitarian definition of the American Dream.And there was Katharine Lee Bates, a professor of English at Wellesley College. Bates was an accomplished and published poet, whose book America the Beautiful and Other Poems includes a sequence of poems expressing outrage at U.S. imperialism in the Philippines. A member of progressive-reform circles in the Boston area, concerned about labor rights, urban slums and women's suffrage, an ardent feminist, for decades she lived with and loved her Wellesley colleague Katharine Coman, an economist and social activist.""America the Beautiful,"" written in 1893, not only speaks to the beauty of the American continent but also reflects her view that U.S. imperialism undermines the nation's core values of freedom and liberty. The poem's final words -- ""and crown thy good with brotherhood, from sea to shining sea"" -- are an appeal for social justice rather than the pursuit of wealth.In the Depression years and during World War II, the fusion of populist, egalitarian and anti-racist values with patriotic expression reached full flower.Langston Hughes' poem, ""Let America Be America Again,"" written in 1936, contrasted the nation's promise with its mistreatment of his fellow African-Americans, the poor, Native Americans, workers, farmers and immigrants:O, let my land be a land where Liberty Is crowned with no false patriotic wreath But opportunity is real, and life is free Equality is in the air we breathe. In 1939, composer Earl Robinson teamed with lyricist John La Touche to write ""Ballad for Americans,"" which was performed on the CBS radio network by Paul Robeson, accompanied by chorus and orchestra. This 11-minute cantata provided a musical review of American history, depicted as a struggle between the ""nobody who's everybody"" and an elite that fails to understand the real, democratic essence of America.Robeson, at the time one of the best-known performers on the world stage, became, through this work, a voice of America. Broadcasts and recordings of ""Ballad for Americans"" (by Bing Crosby as well as Robeson) were immensely popular. In the summer of 1940, it was performed at the national conventions of both the Republican and Communist parties. The work soon became a staple in school choral performances, but it was literally ripped out of many public school songbooks after Robinson and Robeson were identified with the radical left and blacklisted during the McCarthy period. Since then, however, ""Ballad for Americans"" has been periodically revived, notably during the bicentennial celebration in 1976, when a number of pop and country singers performed it in concerts and on TV.Aaron Copland's ""Fanfare for the Common Man"" and ""A Lincoln Portrait,"" both written in 1942, are now patriotic musical standards, regularly performed at major civic events. Few Americans know that Copland was a member of a radical composers' group.Many Americans consider Woody Guthrie's song ""This Land Is Your Land,"" penned in 1940, to be our unofficial national anthem. Guthrie, a radical, was inspired to write the song as an answer to Irving Berlin's popular ""God Bless America,"" which he thought failed to recognize that it was the ""people"" to whom America belonged.The words to ""This Land Is Your Land"" reflect Guthrie's assumption that patriotism and support for the underdog were interconnected. In this song, Guthrie celebrated America's natural beauty and bounty, but criticized the country for its failure to share its riches. This is reflected in the song's last and least-known verse, which Pete Seeger and Bruce Springsteen included when they performed the song in January 2009 at a pre-inaugural concert in front of the Lincoln Memorial, with President-elect Obama in the audience:One bright sunny morning; In the shadow of the steeple; By the relief office; I saw my people. As they stood hungry; I stood there wondering; If this land was made for you and me. During the 1960s, American progressives continued to seek ways to fuse their love of country with their opposition to the government's policies. The March on Washington in 1963 gathered at the Lincoln Memorial, where Martin Luther King Jr. famously quoted the words to ""My Country 'Tis of Thee,"" repeating the phrase ""Let freedom ring"" 11 times.Phil Ochs, then part of a new generation of politically conscious singer-songwriters who emerged during the 1960s, wrote an anthem in the Guthrie vein, ""The Power and the Glory,"" that coupled love of country with a strong plea for justice and equality. The words to the chorus echo the sentiments of the anti-Vietnam War movement:Here is a land full of power and glory; Beauty that words cannot recall; Oh her power shall rest on the strength of her freedom; Her glory shall rest on us all. One of its stanzas updated Guthrie's combination of outrage and patriotism:Yet she's only as rich as the poorest of her poor; Only as free as the padlocked prison door; Only as strong as our love for this land; Only as tall as we stand. This song later became part of the repertoire of the U.S. Army band.And in 1968, in a famous anti-war speech, Norman Thomas, the aging leader of the Socialist Party, proclaimed, ""I come to cleanse the American flag, not burn it.""In recent decades, Bruce Springsteen has most closely followed in the Guthrie tradition. From ""Born in the USA,"" to his songs about Tom Joad (the militant protagonist in John Steinbeck's The Grapes of Wrath), to his anthem about the 9/11 tragedy (""Empty Sky""), to his album Wrecking Ball (including its opening song, ""We Take Care of Our Own""), Springsteen has championed the downtrodden while challenging America to live up to its ideals.Steve (""Little Stevie"") Van Zandt is best known as the guitarist with Springsteen's E Street Band and for his role as Silvio Dante, Tony Soprano's sidekick on the TV show, The Sopranos. But his most enduring legacy should be his love song about America, ""I Am a Patriot,"" including these lyrics:I am a patriot, and I love my country; Because my country is all I know. Wanna be with my family; People who understand me; I got no place else to go. And I ain't no communist, And I ain't no socialist, And I ain't no capitalist, And I ain't no imperialist, And I ain't no Democrat, Sure ain't no Republican either, I only know one party, And that is freedom.Since the American Revolution, each generation of progressives has expressed an American patriotism rooted in democratic values that challenged jingoism and ""my country -- right or wrong"" thinking. They rejected blind nationalism, militaristic drum beating, and sheep-like conformism. Throughout the United States' history, they have viewed their movements -- abolition of slavery, farmers' populism, women's suffrage, workers' rights, civil rights, environmentalism, gay rights, and others -- as profoundly patriotic. They believed that America's core claims -- fairness, equality, freedom, justice -- were their own.America now confronts a new version of the Gilded Age, brought upon by Wall Street greed and corporate malfeasance. In the midst of a recession, the gap between rich and poor is still widening. Although the economy has improved in recent years, Americans are feeling more economically insecure than at any time since the Depression. They are upset by the unbridled selfishness and political influence-peddling demonstrated by banks, oil companies, drug companies, insurance companies, and other large corporations. They are angry at the growing power of American-based global firms who show no loyalty to their country, outsource jobs to low-wage countries, avoid paying taxes, and pollute the environment. Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart, America's largest corporation, promoted the motto ""Buy American."" But today the retail giant, now owned by his heirs, imports most of its merchandise from Asia, much of it made under sweatshop conditions. (About $4 million worth of American flags -- which accounts for 6 percent of all American flags -- are made overseas, mostly in China.)We are, once again, battling over immigration and who belongs in America. Some right-wing groups and talk-show pundits, calling themselves patriots, have even challenged the citizenship of our president. These trends have triggered a growing grassroots movement -- reflected by Occupy Wall Street but involving a diverse coalition of community groups, immigrant rights organizations, unions, consumer advocates, and human rights activists -- demanding stronger regulations to protect consumers, workers, and the environment from abusive corporations, living wages, fairer trade, and higher taxes on the very rich to pay for better schools, safer roads, and student loans.This movement, which embodies the idea of ""liberty and justice for all,"" reflects America's tradition of progressive patriotism. It recognizes that conservatives have never had a monopoly on Old Glory.Happy Flag Day! Peter Dreier teaches politics at Occidental College.

But killing a trade deal when it offers at least the hope of a better future for the American economy is not the way to fix those pressing problems.,2015-06-14,2015-06-14-1434322014-5493355-tppgraphic_large_verge_medium_landscape.jpeg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-14-1434322014-5493355-tppgraphic_large_verge_medium_landscape-thumb.jpeg," America is at a crossroads in the global economy. The debate over the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) highlights the sharp divisions in Congress over trade, as well as the important stakes for America's economic future. Few would argue that the United States needs to compete aggressively in the global economy. While we are still the world's largest economy (with China nipping at our heels), we no longer dominate as we did over the last half century. The challenge is how to compete effectively and still maintain our standard of living, environmental controls and, ultimately, our values as a society. Although everyone would like to see the return of decent-paying jobs, the fact is that many of those jobs are gone forever, thanks to globalization and advancing technology. For the past twenty years, middle-class incomes have stagnated. There is little hope for restoring the middle class, or even halting its decline, except by growing the economy. Even a heavy dose of government stimulus will have to be paid for with economic growth or taxes, and taxing billionaires or even large corporations will not be enough to restore the health of the middle class without economic growth. And, however you slice it, economic growth will require vibrant global trade. There are objections to the TPP from both sides of the political fence. Progressives decry the weak labor protections and environmental controls. Conservatives see loopholes for more liberal immigration policies. And both sides believe that the proposed agreement favors big banks and corporations over average folks. Much of their criticism is valid, and there is a lot that the White House can do to strengthen the accord. However, there are also serious limitations to our negotiating position, and we should lower our expectations about what the TPP can actually accomplish. What the TPP cannot do is resolve income inequality, improve the environment or stop illegal immigration. While these trade deals often come with rules of behavior for the signatory nations, getting the rules enforced is another matter. Sure, we will have some leverage over what Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and Chile do in the area of human rights, labor relations, environmental regulation and immigration control, but most of their policies will be determined by their own national interests and domestic politics. So the reality is that no trade deal is going to deliver everything, or even most, of what the critics want. Furthermore, American manufacturing workers - who stand to be the big loser in this trade deal - are likely to get the short end of any trade deal. There is simply no way to protect American workers in the long run from foreign competition, deal or no deal. What the administration can do is provide the help and support that workers need to either transition to other sectors of the economy or provide them a safety net. But protecting jobs from global competition is a virtually impossible task, whether or not there is a trade deal. While there may be somewhat more hope on the environmental front, that is still a steep climb, as are tighter controls to prevent illegal immigration. Clearly, as Hillary Clinton has said, the President should ""listen to and work with his allies in Congress, starting with Nancy Pelosi, who have expressed their concerns about the impact that a weak agreement would have on our workers to make sure we get the best, strongest deal possible. And if we don't get it,"" said Clinton, ""there should be no deal."" Clinton has offered wise advice, which those on both sides of the political aisle should consider. Note that she said Obama should ""listen and work"" with his allies to get the strongest deal possible. But that doesn't mean they should kill the fast track legislation. Killing fast track would effectively kill the deal, for several reasons. First, our negotiating partners will realize that they are negotiating with an unwieldy and dysfunctional Congress, a dubious partner at best, rather than with the President. Secondly, even if our negotiating partners continued the talks and Obama gets an acceptable deal, it would likely get bogged down in the Congress over partisan wrangling - not enough labor protection, too many loopholes on immigration. It's unlikely that anything would pass, and then only after a lengthy and bitter fight. An up or down vote on an eventual trade pact would not guarantee that we get a good deal, but it would at least hold out the possibility of any deal at all. Even with fast track, Congress will have a big fight over the ultimate pact, but the chances of passing it would be increased somewhat. There is absolutely no doubt that this country faces serious issues of income inequality, the loss of middle-class jobs, the corruption of government with big money, the degradation of government and a broken immigration system. But killing a trade deal when it offers at least the hope of a better future for the American economy is not the way to fix those pressing problems."

This is pretty remarkable, and it's a scary example of a radically libertarian philosophy that could cause our financial system to melt down in a big way.  It is always fascinating (not the only word that comes to mind) when people who don't believe in government are charged with running it, especially when it comes to our country's financial stability. The three biggest financial meltdowns of the last 100 years -- the stock market crash of 1929, the Savings and Loan crisis of the 1980s, and the financial collapse of 2008 -- happened on the watch of our three most conservative administrations in terms of economic policy of those 100 years, and that is no coincidence (I'm counting Coolidge and Hoover as one administration since the '29 crash happened so early in Hoover's term). Presidents and regulators who let financial titans run wild and free pay a heavy price -- or at least the countries they run do.  Piwowar fills one of the two SEC commissioner seats allotted to Republicans. Although he was appointed by President Obama last year, he is exactly the kind of commissioner a Republican president would pick -- a regulator who disdains regulation. Since late May, Piwowar is or has been a featured speaker at events for three of the most right-wing, libertarian groups in the country: the Cato Institute, the Federalist Society, and the Mercatus Center. At the Cato event, Commissioner Piwowar was asked whether he knew of any time in history when the SEC had saved investors any money, an odd question given the SEC's role in forcing more financial disclosure for investors and stopping fraud in financial services. In fact, from the time the SEC was created in the early 1930s until financial deregulation accelerated in the 1980s, there were none of the major financial crashes that had been wrecking the American economy about once every 20 years from the 1830s to the 1930s. The SEC's role in preventing fraud was a major factor in that change, along with Glass-Steagall, which broke up the investor banks from the commercial banks.But Piwowar's answer to that ridiculous question is chilling: ""I can answer that in three words: I don't know."" Here's an SEC commissioner so radically libertarian he doesn't know if the agency he is a part of has ever, in any way, done any good at all.  Worse still is Piwowar's belief that the SEC should not promote investor confidence, but investor skepticism. He apparently wants investors to have no faith in our financial institutions because it is better if they assume everyone in the marketplace is trying to cheat them. Protections for investors make them soft and careless, and are another example of the nanny state. According to this worldview, you deserve to lose everything, even if you are scammed, because you have failed to do your homework.   This is such a bad idea on so many levels. Markets don't function effectively or fairly without rules that make it difficult to swindle people, and investment is far more likely to happen if people don't assume they are about to be cheated.  Here's the video. Prepare to be astonished that someone who believes these things actually works for our government:"

The Democratic hopeful addressed supporters at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Park on Roosevelt Island. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb900092500008e013a5fb0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton's decision to hold the first major public rally of her campaign at Four Freedoms Park in New York City reminds us not only of the many challenges the United States has faced in the past, but also the many challenges we face today as we seek to build a better future for ourselves and for our children.It was on January 6, 1941, in one of the darkest moments of the Second World War, after Hitler had announced his decision to establish a ""new order"" in occupied Europe, that Franklin Roosevelt took to the world's airways to propose a different idea -- a ""moral order,"" based not on ""the tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb,"" but on four fundamental human freedoms: freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. Inspired by this simple yet eloquent vision, the United States and its allies would not only go on to defeat the forces of tyranny that sought to dominate the world in the early 1940s, but also construct the institutions required to ensure that humanity's advance toward the goal of the four freedoms would continue. Four Freedoms Park, where Secretary Clinton will speak, stands in the shadow of the most visible of these institutions -- the United Nations, which for all its imperfections has done more to advance the cause of peace and the four freedoms since its founding in 1945 than any other international body.The successful establishment of the United Nations, and Eleanor Roosevelt's role in the adoption of the all-important Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the General Assembly in 1948, would no doubt have pleased FDR enormously. But the international push to advance the four freedoms was not the only issue that FDR was focused on as the United States and the world made the transition from war to peace. He was also deeply concerned about the state of the four freedoms here at home -- especially freedom from want and fear.Having witnessed the rise of Nazism in the wake of economic crisis of the early 1930s, FDR observed two simple truths about the liberty of a democratic people: The first was that ""the liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic state itself."" The second was that ""the liberty of a democracy is not safe if its business system does not provide employment and produce and distribute goods in such a way as to sustain an acceptable standard of living."" In other words, inequality and the concentration of wealth in the hands of all but a few is not only immoral but also dangerous and inimical to the maintenance of a healthy democracy.The programs and policies that FDR launched in the New Deal -- from the Social Security Act to the minimum wage provisions in the Fair Labor Standards Act -- were designed to help reduce the level of inequality in America. But as a recent report released by Roosevelt Institute Chief Economist Joseph Stiglitz shows, we once again find ourselves living in an America with levels of inequality not seen since the Great Depression. Since the late 1970s, for example, while the average hourly wage for the American worker has increased by a mere 0.1 percent per year, the average annual compensation for America's top 500 CEOs has skyrocketed from $1 million to $33 million. As a result, the ratio of average annual income of CEOs to workers now stands at 295:1, up from the average of 20:1 in 1965. Further evidence for the rise in inequality can be seen in the tax rates paid by the wealthy versus the rest of us, in the growth of the increasingly deregulated financial sector of the U.S. economy, and in the lack of upward mobility among the poor, especially among disadvantaged people of color.As Stiglitz argues, these levels of inequality are no accident, but the result of a series of incremental changes made to the rules governing our economy over the past 30 years, rules designed to funnel more and more of the nation's wealth to the top, which have essentially destroyed the balance of economic power that was set in motion by the New Deal and achieved in the three decades after WWII.Historians looking back 50 years from now will no doubt see the rise of income inequality as one of the defining moments of our time. They will also no doubt recognize that in spite the progress we have made and the election of the nation's first black president, a country where 30 percent of African American children, 28 percent of Native American children, and 23 percent of Latino children live in poverty -- as opposed to just 4 percent of white children -- is not a country free of racial discrimination. Nor is a nation where one in six black men has been incarcerated since 2001, and where the average young African-American male lives in terror of the police, a nation that can say it has rid itself of freedom from fear. Eleanor Roosevelt once said -- echoing her husband's first inaugural -- that ""democracy is not about words, but action."" The generation that lived through World War II and built the great American middle class certainly understood this. One hopes that Secretary Clinton, moving forward from her speech today on Roosevelt Island, will inspire a new generation to take up the challenge of achieving the four freedoms with the same determination as our parents and grandparents. Doing so would bring FDR's remarkable vision of what he called ""the kind of world achievable in our own time and generation"" one step closer to reality."

""We celebrate all the Jewish holidays but the students also learn about Ramadan and children will bring in candies and foods during Eid al-Fitr and Christmas,"" she added.""The children have to deal with challenges every day, from seemingly insurmountable learning troubles to mobility issues. When they meet each other, there is mutual understanding of what the other is going through,"" explains Shehav. ""That creates a special bond between the students that crosses all lines.""The ONN School, which is open six days a week, offers a holistic approach and aims to provide academic, social and life skills for the students, who range from 6 to 21 years of age. Classes are made up of no more than 8 students who in addition to acquiring an education, are also prepared for life after school. The administration works to find them suitable frameworks once they graduate high school.While there are other schools in Israel similar to the ONN School, the state school is the largest one in the country according to Berman.""I'm very proud of our school and especially of our students,"" Berman told Tazpit. ""The kids don't feel sorry for themselves. They work to win their battles every day. We are there to help them overcome their challenges and you can feel that there is a happy atmosphere here.""""More people need to hear about us,"" added Berman.Indeed, on Tuesday, June 9, 10 special needs students from the Onn School were hosted by First Lady Nechama Rivlin during a special Masa-Journey Israel project for students who require special assistance as well as use of wheelchairs. The 10 students took part in a special three-day program for those completing their high school education and took part in activities that addressed issues related to personal, national and social identity.Among the students who participated in the visit were Walid Abu Habish from Jaffa, Omer Lahat from Shoam and Nastia Molodovsky. Molodovsky told the First Lady that she was completing national service at a medical center and Lahat, 19, explained that he would soon be enlisting to the IDF to serve in the Home Front Command.""I have been struggling for a year to be able join the IDF, and I was waiting with bated breath,"" Omer Lahat told Rivlin. The First Lady congratulated Lahat, who will be enlisting next week, and presented him with a small Book of Psalms as a gift. ""I want to congratulate you for volunteering to serve in the IDF, may you be a wonderful example to many students, and all those who will serve with you,"" she said.The First Lady told the special needs students that she was very pleased to host them at the President's Residence.

The school is special in that most of the children who attend, have cerebral palsy and other degenerative diseases while others have secondary disabilities that include speech, sight and hearing difficulties.Occupational and speech therapists, physiotherapists, social workers, psychologists, and of course teachers, make up the school's staff.Cerebral palsy is a non-progressive brain disorder that damages brain tissue that controls movement, impairing muscle coordination.Established 50 years ago, the ONN School is open 11 months during the year and six days a week, for students who come from 60 different communities across Israel. The diverse student population includes Muslim, Christian, and Jewish children.""We have Arab students, alongside Haredi and religious Jewish students, as well as children of foreign workers, and sabra Israelis, rich and poor -- they are all educated in an open and accepting environment,"" said ONN's Vice Principal, Shenhav Berman in an interview with Tazpit News Agency.""There is a special atmosphere here. When a religious Jewish student blesses his food, his Arab friend will answer amen,"" Berman told Tazpit. ""We celebrate all the Jewish holidays but the students also learn about Ramadan and children will bring in candies and foods during Eid al-Fitr and Christmas,"" she added.""The children have to deal with challenges every day, from seemingly insurmountable learning troubles to mobility issues. When they meet each other, there is mutual understanding of what the other is going through,"" explains Shehav. ""That creates a special bond between the students that crosses all lines.""The ONN School, which is open six days a week, offers a holistic approach and aims to provide academic, social and life skills for the students, who range from 6 to 21 years of age. Classes are made up of no more than 8 students who in addition to acquiring an education, are also prepared for life after school. The administration works to find them suitable frameworks once they graduate high school.While there are other schools in Israel similar to the ONN School, the state school is the largest one in the country according to Berman.""I'm very proud of our school and especially of our students,"" Berman told Tazpit. ""The kids don't feel sorry for themselves. They work to win their battles every day. We are there to help them overcome their challenges and you can feel that there is a happy atmosphere here.""""More people need to hear about us,"" added Berman.Indeed, on Tuesday, June 9, 10 special needs students from the Onn School were hosted by First Lady Nechama Rivlin during a special Masa-Journey Israel project for students who require special assistance as well as use of wheelchairs. The 10 students took part in a special three-day program for those completing their high school education and took part in activities that addressed issues related to personal, national and social identity.Among the students who participated in the visit were Walid Abu Habish from Jaffa, Omer Lahat from Shoam and Nastia Molodovsky. Molodovsky told the First Lady that she was completing national service at a medical center and Lahat, 19, explained that he would soon be enlisting to the IDF to serve in the Home Front Command.""I have been struggling for a year to be able join the IDF, and I was waiting with bated breath,"" Omer Lahat told Rivlin. The First Lady congratulated Lahat, who will be enlisting next week, and presented him with a small Book of Psalms as a gift. ""I want to congratulate you for volunteering to serve in the IDF, may you be a wonderful example to many students, and all those who will serve with you,"" she said.The First Lady told the special needs students that she was very pleased to host them at the President's Residence. ""Out of all the honored guests from Israel and around the world that come to sit in this room, I am deeply honored to meet with you,"" she said.Photos: President's Spokesperson / Israel's President Reuven Rivlin and his wife, Nechama, with a delegation of ONN School students visiting the President's Residence in Jerusalem last week.

26,BUSINESS,Why Our Trade Deal Disasters March On,"Greg Autry, ContributorAssistant Prof. of Clinical Entrepreneurship at USC, Economist...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-the-trade-deal-disast_b_7580524.html,"America at a trade meeting is like some backwoods buyer walking onto a used car lot full of smarmy salesmen with his checkbook out while loudly shouting, ""I'm not leaving here without a car!""",2015-06-14,2015-06-14-1434304279-8000240-320pxUS_Trade_Balance_1980_2012.svg.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-14-1434304279-8000240-320pxUS_Trade_Balance_1980_2012.svg-thumb.png,"While trade is indeed a great and wonderful force for improving the human condition, the fundamental problem with any agreement approaching the scope of the Trans Pacific Partnership is that the complex weave of needs and demands from many nations will invariably cause it to deviate very significantly from David Ricardo's extremely simple theoretical model of free trade. In doing so, those theoretical Ricardian gains are reduced and the distribution of any remaining gains is very uneven. This unevenness creates opportunities for mercantilist exploitation by countries that approach trade pragmatically and aggressively. Their victims are those who naively pursue ""free trade"" as an ideological ideal, are desperate to make a deal under an all too obvious deadline and whose top officials are easily and openly corrupted; namely, the United States of America.America at a trade meeting is like some backwoods buyer walking onto a used car lot full of smarmy salesmen with his checkbook out while loudly shouting, ""I'm not leaving here without a car!"" This explains why the promised manufacturing job gains from deals like the recent Korea Free Trade agreement never materialize. In fact, it's just the opposite as KORUS demonstrated. In the three years following that deal Korean exports boomed and U.S. exports declined and our trade deficit with that country nearly doubled. Decades of this sort of naivety explain why the chart of American trade losses since NAFTA look like a mirror of the hockey stick curve from an overly ambitious student business pitch. Sadly, the only ""upticks"" in this chart are recessionary years when American's couldn't afford to buy much of anything. We are currently shipping away about 2% of our GDP annually, which makes all the difference between realistic economic growth and the endless slow-growth morass we've been stuck in. So why do administrations, particularly supposedly pro-labor ones, continue to pursue these deals? There are two sad reasons. The first is that the American President, notably this one, always yearns to establish a major foreign policy legacy before leaving office. This creates that dangerous sense of urgency that America always brings to a negotiating table filled with smarter, less desperate dealmakers. After all our future TPP ""partners"" like the Sultan of Brunei and the communist dictators of Vietnam aren't about to be forced out of office in a democratic power transition. The second reason the bad trade deal parade marches on is that the President's advisors and the top staff of the congressional leadership always recommend it. Partially, this is because many of these folks are currently feathering their nest for lucrative consulting and lobbying deals abroad when they leave governmental service. Even former Presidents and Secretaries of State play the game. In their defense, their advocacy for trade deals is always backed with the recommendations of top economists from leading DC think tanks. Why is that? In any discipline other than macroeconomics the scientific method would demand rejection of a theory, no matter how beloved, when it failed multiple real world tests. As the empirical evidence against ideological free trade piles higher, it requires ever more brilliant minds, building ever more intimidating mathematical models to justify our continuing down this road to hell. That takes lots of money and somebody has to be paying for it. Who is that?Powerful U.S. manufacturers now offshore most of their production to exploit labor and the environment abroad and they benefit even more from the uneven playing field America negotiates in these deals. Big retailers love the low prices it enables them to offer the underemployed, debt-burdened American consumer. The looser here are most American workers and those small business owners and entrepreneurs who struggle daily to create real American jobs in a noncompetitive regulatory climate. However, those folks and their little business don't matter because they don't fund DC think tanks or the PACs and Super PACs that elect our Presidents and keep the Congressional leadership firmly in place.Greg Autry is an Assistant Professor of Clinical Entrepreneurship at the Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California.

Her speech was populist in tone as she promised that if elected president she would close the income gap between rich and poor.Several thousand enthusiastic supporters gathered on a picture perfect day to hear the Democratic frontrunner speak on New York City's Roosevelt Island, located between Manhattan and Queens in the East River. But this speech would have better timed had it been scheduled two months ago when she officially announced she was a candidate for president.Instead, she went on a closely guarded listening tour of voters and dodged press questions about controversies swirling around her campaign. In that time she was subject to Republican attacks related to her private email server, her role in the Clinton Foundation and potential conflicts of interest while serving as secretary of state. As a consequence, polling around her likability and trustworthiness has gone negative.While Republicans have been attacking Clinton, populist Democratic candidates have been critical of her campaign as well. Senator Bernie Sanders, a distant second to Clinton in the polls, has been particularly aggressive. ""I don't have a super PAC. I'm not going to be getting huge sums of money from millionaires and billionaires,"" Sanders told MSNBC last week when asked to explain how he is different than Clinton. ""So, working families all over this country are saying, Bernie, we want to stand with you, take on this billionaire class who are dominating our economics and our politics,"" he concluded.In her speech Sunday, Clinton reached out to the party base by quoting Democratic President Franklin Roosevelt. ""He said there's no mystery about what it takes to build a strong and prosperous America: 'Equality of opportunity... Jobs for those who can work... Security for those who need it... The ending of special privilege for the few... The preservation of civil liberties for all...a wider and constantly rising standard of living.'"" She then added, with a smile, ""That sounds good to me.""Clinton did offer policies she would pursue as president, including universal prekindergarten, paid family leave, equal pay for women, college affordability and incentives for companies that provide profit sharing to employees. She also said she would change the tax code ""so it rewards hard work at home"" rather than corporations ""stashing profits overseas."" To achieve her goals she said, ""Our next President must work with Congress and every other willing partner across our entire country. And I will do just that to turn the tide so these currents start working for us more than against us.""In a response to charges that she is out of touch with Middle America, she cited her humble upbringing and promised, ""I've spent my life fighting for children, families, and our country. And I'm not stopping now."" For those who have expressed concern about her age, she said, ""I may not be the youngest candidate in this race, but I will be the youngest woman president in the history of the United States.""Clinton has been a polarizing figure throughout her career, and she will continue to be the target of political attacks from all sides throughout the campaign. In her speech, she portrayed herself as a fighter -- ""I've been called many things by many people, quitter is not one of them.'' But, ultimately, Clinton will have to be more publicly accountable for some of the legitimate questions that have been raised around her candidacy because they are not going away."

At least 10 people have been killed in the disaster, including three zoo workers.An escaped hippo was cornered in one of the city's main squares and subdued with a tranquilizer gun, the zoo said. Some other animals also have been seized, but it remained unclear how many are on the loose. Bears and wolves are also among the animals who fled from their enclosures amid the flooding from heavy rains and high winds.There were no immediate reports that any of the fatalities were due to animal attacks. The zoo said one of the dead was Guliko Chitadze, a zookeeper who lost an arm in an attack by a tiger last month.Heavy rains and wind hit Tbilisi during the night, turning a normally small stream that runs through the hilly city into a surging river. The flooding also damaged dozens of houses. City mayor David Narmania told journalists that 10 people were known to have died; 10 others were reported missing.Helicopters are circling the city and residents have been told to stay indoors except in an emergency. About 1.1 million people live in the former Soviet republic's capital.The head of the Georgian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Ilia II, was quoted by the Interfax news agency as telling a Sunday Mass that Georgia's former Communist rulers could be seen as involved in the disaster.""When Communists came to us in this country, they ordered that all crosses and bells of the churches be melted down and the money used to build the zoo,"" he said.

Bush faced ridicule from critics who noted the list did not include powerful allies like France and Germany. Few of the 48 countries on the list contributed troops to the invasion force.In a presidential debate while seeking re-election in the 2004 vote, Bush defended the coalition with a line that would become embraced by satirists, ""You forgot Poland.""It was not the first time a likely 2016 Republican candidate had trouble hitting the right note on Iraq. Bush's brother, former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, stumbled repeatedly after being asked if he would have supported the 2003 invasion knowing that there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.Christie, who did not confirm if he would announce a candidacy, told ABC the United States does not need to send more troops to Iraq at this time and should concentrate on bringing its allies into the fight.The Obama administration coalition partners in the fight against Islamic State in Syria and Iraq include regional Sunni Muslim allies Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Jordan.South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham, another Republican presidential candidate, is pressing for 10,000 United States troops to fight Islamic State.

That's the question prompted by two recent political scandals that have touched the tourism world. But the answer -- or the lack of an answer -- may be far more troubling than the alleged misconduct.,2015-06-14,2015-06-14-1434305387-5907060-shutterstock_238711048.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-14-1434305387-5907060-shutterstock_238711048-thumb.jpg,"What has Washington done for airline passengers lately?That's the question prompted by two recent political scandals that have touched the tourism world. But the answer -- or the lack of an answer -- may be far more troubling than the alleged misconduct.First was news that Rep. Bill Shuster (R-Pa.), who chairs the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, is dating Shelley Rubino, an airline lobbyist. Consumer advocates claim the relationship has influenced Shuster's committee, including the adoption of a bill called the Transparent Airfares Act.The other dust-up involves a report that the U.S. attorney's office in New Jersey is looking into allegations that United Airlines employees made improper attempts to influence an official of the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey by adding a revenue-losing flight from Newark to Columbia, S.C., to its schedule.These incidents, and the fallout from them, are unlikely to affect your next flight, let alone your summer vacation. But they made me wonder whether air travelers were paying attention to what happens in Washington.Does anyone care? I asked numerous travelers whether they could name one recent piece of legislation that helped them. The answer? Crickets.So I turned to Airlines for America (A4A), an airline trade group. A spokeswoman offered responses that are unlikely to resonate with the average traveler. They include significant, but relatively obscure congressional achievements such as ending sequestration-related delays in 2013, restoration of the round-trip passenger security tax cap and the passage of the last budget, which included more than 800 customs officers for aviation.I sent a note to Jim Billimoria, a spokesman for Shuster's committee, and asked for a list of its legislative accomplishments, besides the ones reported in the news recently. His answer was a link to a news release that touted the committee's recent measures to ensure that cellphones can't be used to make calls in cabins and efforts to save taxpayers money through the more efficient use of federal building space.""When it comes to cellphones on planes,"" Shuster said in the news release, ""tap, don't talk.""Perhaps that's why travelers seem underwhelmed. When arguably the most powerful travel committee in Washington answers a question about its achievements with ""tap, don't talk,"" can consumers be forgiven for feeling as though Washington doesn't care? Instead of dealing with issues that really matter to travelers, legislators are nibbling around the edges, passing bills that make no noticeable difference to the average air traveler.Sally Greenberg, the executive director of the National Consumers League, sees it as a massive, systemwide failure.""There's no regulation or oversight of the airline industry,"" she says. ""The Department of Transportation is a paper tiger. There have been no congressional hearings or oversight for the past five years.""Greenberg says Washington's biggest achievement was the 2011 adoption of a regulation that allows most air travelers to cancel their flights within a day of making a reservation, the so-called 24-hour rule, technically a regulation for which the Transportation Department is responsible. Another popular regulation, which requires airlines to disclose all mandatory fees at the time of the ticket purchase, would be undone if Shuster's Transparent Airfares Act becomes law.""Passenger rights legislation can't get a hearing,"" agrees Paul Hudson, president of Flyersrights.org, a consumer advocacy organization. ""Airline passenger representatives have been effectively barred from testifying on the airline and airport proposals to privatize air traffic control, abolish the TSA and return to private pre-9/11 security, wholesale FAA delegation of safety regulation to the industry and repeal the few DOT consumer protection regulations.""Hudson's group has a long list of legislative priorities. They include ending airline exemption from all state and local consumer protection laws, restoring regulations that minimized travel delays, and funding a passenger complaint hotline. But none of these ideas are likely to be seriously considered because, as Greenberg noted, Congress is ""in bed"" with the industry.It's no wonder that Congress can't do anything for the average traveler, says Kevin Mitchell, president of the Business Travel Coalition, which advocates for business fliers. Members of Congress aren't rewarded just for supporting pro-airline agendas, like the recent industry push to block Persian Gulf carriers from competing with domestic carriers. Airlines return the love by making generous campaign contributions and coddling lawmakers and their staff with preferential treatment, waiving many ticket rules for them. Maybe, he adds, it's better off that air travelers are in the dark.""The American people would be saddened and sickened to learn that members of Congress not only put their personal interests before their constituents, but also can go much further and inflict financial harm on all of the traveling public,"" he says.The timing of these scandals could translate into bad news for the airline industry, says Charles Leocha, president of Travelers United, an advocacy group that I co-founded. The most obvious opportunity to affect airline policy, the upcoming Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill, is on this summer's agenda, and widespread unhappiness with the airline industry's undue influence on Congress could weaken its negotiating position.The only way to ensure Washington does something? Apart from electing a new legislature, you can bypass Congress entirely.""Complain, complain, complain,"" Leocha says. ""Complain in writing to the Department of Transportation about packed planes, tight seating, hidden fees and cancellation and change fees. When DOT gets a series of complaints, they do spring into action.""After you've left a comment here, let's continue the discussion on my consumer advocacy site or on Twitter, Facebook and Google. I also have a newsletter and you'll definitely want to order my new, amazingly helpful and subversive book called How to Be the World's Smartest Traveler (and Save Time, Money, and Hassle).

The treaty was borne out of a need to promote a rights agenda that was relevant to Africa. The Charter revisited most ideals articulated in the United Nation's Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), though went a step further and boldly committed to protecting children from harmful cultural and social practices. Article 21 explicitly refers to protecting Africa's children against child marriages, betrothal and urging countries to push the minimum age of marriage to 18 years. Today, as Africa simultaneously commemorates the Day of the African Child and the 25 anniversary of the Charter, we have a rare opportunity to reflect on both progress and challenges in responding to child marriages in Africa. We have seen, firsthand, transformations rooted in the Charter. It has laid down the foundation for numerous child rights achievements. We have witnessed a continent that is honest with itself and one that is ready to have critical conversations on social norms, on cultural practices and their impact on children's rights. We see a continent that has made huge strides in protecting its children. Specifically, the African Union's recent campaign on child marriage has been essential for refocusing regional attention on the issue. Africa's voice on child marriages has been escalated, and there is a mounting global movement of more than 400 civil society organizations working against early marriage, while a recent resolution on ending child marriage adopted by the United Nations General Assembly and the Human Rights Council shows growing global momentum around the topic.Yet, despite the success of the African Charter in providing a regional rubric and a platform for dialogue on child marriages, the practice remains rampant. Africa has the second highest rate of child marriage in the world after South Asia. Reports show that 39 percent of girls in sub-Saharan Africa are married before their 18 birthdays. That's more than one in three girls. Globally, every year, 15 million girls are married before they turn 18, and it is estimated that between 2011 and 2020 more than 140 million girls will become child brides. These staggering figures are evidence that the challenge remains enormous. And each number wears the face of a child. Child marriage is a complex and multifaceted challenge, often urged on by economic, social and cultural factors. Combating it requires accelerating successful practices and innovative approaches. We would suggest five attainable actions:First, a crucial entry point to responding to child marriage is being alive to the cultural nuances that drive it. For instance, we know that in most communities child marriages are a culmination of well-orchestrated social actions, backed by established marriage customs. These customs are intrinsic and cherished by communities, often presided by family patriarchs, respectable community matrons, traditional and religious leaders who are driven by noble intentions. Communities often view child marriage as prevention to HIV, a way to safeguard young boys and girls in a fast-evolving modern world. Hence, any engagement should consider these perspectives. As such, more support needs to be given to community leaders across the continent who are proactively coming up with alternative ways of ushering boys and girls into adulthood than early marriage. In these communities, far from the dictates of international, regional and even national laws -- where customary practices dictate maturity and readiness to marry -- such community-driven solutions would be more sustainable.Second, closely linked to community-based efforts will be addressing the structural causes of child marriage. This includes challenging gender stereotypes, promoting gender equality and equal opportunities for girls and boys. Actions across all layers should be steeped in effective social mobilization and meaningful and sustainable partnerships between government, research institutions, civic organizations, development partners and communities.Third, at national level, it is vital that proven efforts are strengthened. This means supporting governments in budgeting and implementation of policies, laws and strategies that prevent and counter child marriages. Robust child protection systems that track, account and safeguard children from early marriage should be strengthened. Across the continent, governments should continue investing in proven efforts such as enhancing girls' access to education and skills development.Fourth, decisive leadership and increased political will at community, national and regional levels are paramount. The messaging on girls and boys has to change. Girls and boys should be seen as of equal value across society. It is vitally important that leaders see the link between empowered girls and stronger societies. This also means leaders should move beyond rhetoric to actual social and economic investment on curtailing child marriages. Leaders will have to engage with the powerful constituencies, such as religious and traditional leaders, in seeking change. And finally, a continued honest and frank peer review system at the African Union level will be paramount. This will foster the adoption of policies, standards and practices on child marriages by member states through experience sharing and reinforcement of successful and best practices, and importantly, introduce collective accountability among regional leaders.To successfully effect positive change, collective responsibility and action are essential. The nexus between governments, communities and civil society is imperative. We posit that lasting change requires leaders, development partners and communities to build consensus and agree that child marriage is detrimental to the child, family and nation. Indeed, from the matrona in a remote village to the policy maker at the African Union, a new honesty and fervency is urgently needed to address a practice that is harmful and stifling to this continent's children... and to the continent itself.

I tell her that usually the story starts out with hope. In fact, sometimes it starts off like a fairy tale and the person can't believe his luck. The trafficker may tell the person that she knows of a job where the person can make lots of money and help his family. Many times the person's family is having a hard time. Maybe the person's mom died or is sick and the person wants to help, needs to help, somehow. This job solves the problem and finally, the person thinks, it will all be okay. Sometimes, the person gets to go on a plane to a brand new city or country. This seems exciting -- but once he gets there, what seems like a dream quickly turns into a nightmare.My daughter asks me why the person couldn't tell that the trafficker was mean. I tell her that while traffickers are bad people that control, lie to, hurt and scare other people and force them to work without getting paid, they don't usually look like bad people. A lot of the time they look kind and act really nice, at first. This is hard for her to understand because in her mind if a person is mean on the inside they should look mean too, but that just isn't the case. My daughter says, ""Oh, so they can look nice and be mean just like the lady in Annie (she means Miss Hannigan in the remake of Annie, played by Cameron Diaz)."" I tell her, yes, they don't have to look mean to be mean. My daughter responds by saying, ""And just because a person acts nice, that doesn't mean that they aren't tricking you to do something bad to you."" ""Exactly,"" I say.She asks me what traffickers do, exactly. When she thinks of traffic she thinks of cars, bikes and traffic signs, not people hurting people. I tell her that traffickers are people that make men, women and children work day and night, without pay. This makes them tired and sick.They are forced to do all kinds of work, like make the clothing that we wear everyday, pick fruit, make bricks and ask for money. The traffickers make people live in places that aren't clean or safe, and they don't give them much food, sometimes just mashed vegetables or moldy bread, so they are often hungry. They also don't take them to the doctor if they get sick. My daughter responds by asking why the people who have been trafficked don't leave. ""If they can find a window and open it, can't they run away?"" she asks. I tell her the traffickers threaten to hurt the people if they try, and often the traffickers do hurt them -- not just for trying to escape but just because the traffickers want to and can. This makes the people scared -- they are scared the traffickers will hurt them again and scared they will hurt them, or worse, if they try to run away.My daughter asks where traffickers go to find people to traffic. It seems unreal to her and must be happening far away, she can't imagine it happening anywhere near where we live. I tell her the way trafficking happens is really similar no matter where it takes place, regardless if that is where we live or across the world.We want to believe that trafficking can't happen where we live, but it can and it does because it happens everywhere. Traffickers go to the same places we do, I tell her. They go where there are a lot of people like malls, schools, buses and train stations, and they use Facebook and other Internet sites to try to meet the people they will hurt. They can use classmates at school to recruit and find people to traffic. My daughter is little and this seems unreal, but it happens and we need to talk about it. She asks me what to look out for and what to tell her friends. I tell her to beware of strangers. Stranger danger isn't new to her, but it's a new way to look at it. I tell her to know the clues and to tell an adult she trusts, a teacher or me, if she notices them. ""What are the clues?"" she asks. Kids who are trafficked may miss a lot of school days and they may have bruises or be scared. They may be hungry, tired, have tantrums or outbursts, or their clothes may not make sense. Meaning, they may wear summer clothes when it's cold. There may be an older person that hangs around the child but isn't a family member and seems to tell her/him what to do. Sometimes, one clue alone doesn't tell us much. I tell her that she doesn't have to know for sure. ""If you thinks something is wrong, even if it isn't trafficking, it's good to tell your teacher,"" I say. My daughter asks, but what if she is wrong? What if nothing is going on? ""I don't want to be a tattletale,"" she says. I tell her that telling her teacher that she is worried about a friend or classmate is kind, it isn't tattling. It gets confusing, I know, but I tell her to veer on the safe side and tell the teacher she is worried. She can always tell me too. Parents and teachers are busy and sometimes we don't see what you see, I tell her. Trust your instincts and share. It could save someone's life. If you suspect human trafficking, call the National Human Trafficking Resource Center toll-free at 1-888-373-7888.The other day my daughter asked me some questions about human trafficking, which has been the focal point of my career over the past decade. I want to share her questions, thoughts and my replies because they quickly get at the root of people's common misunderstandings about human trafficking.

If Netanyahu can lead his Likud Party to victory and secure a fourth term in office, he will be well on his way to overtaking the nationâs iconic founding father, David Ben-Gurion, as the longest-ever serving premier and cementing a status as the dominant Israeli politician of the past two decades. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14ff4240000500024fe20.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Do you remember the Monty Python skit, ""News for Parrots""?No parrots were involved in an accident on the M-1 today when a lorry carrying high-octane fuel was in collision with a bollard... A spokesman for parrots said he was glad no parrots were involved.So, here's the trade policy news for peace advocates. On Friday, the pro-war lobbying organization AIPAC was defeated on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives by a vote of 126 to 302. Among Democrats, 40 supported the pro-AIPAC position and 144 opposed it. Among Republicans, 86 supported the pro-AIPAC position and 158 opposed it. The pro-AIPAC position in the House vote was to support the Senate's language on Trade Adjustment Assistance. Under the voting procedures passed by the House Republican leadership, a yes vote in the House on the Senate's TAA language was necessary in order for the House to pass the Senate's version of fast track trade negotiating authority to pre-approve the Trans-Pacific Partnership. When TAA was defeated in the House, fast track was defeated in the House. The Senate's version of fast track trade negotiating authority contained an AIPAC-sponsored provision making it U.S. policy to oppose European restrictions on trade with illegal Israeli settlements in the Palestinian West Bank. So when fast track was defeated in the House, AIPAC was defeated in the House. Of course, AIPAC and its principal champion, Maryland Senator Ben Cardin, lied about their motivations for sponsoring this provision, pretending that the provision was about opposition to ""boycotting Israel,"" dodging any discussion of that fact that the AIPAC legislation defined ""Israeli-controlled territories"" in the Palestinian West Bank as equivalent to ""Israel.""The AIPAC provision was intended to make it U.S. policy that illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank are an intrinsic part of ""Israel."" Of course, if illegal Israeli settlements in the West Bank were an intrinsic part of Israel, then the creation of an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza, and East Jerusalem would be impossible. And of course, that is AIPAC's goal: preventing the emergence of an independent Palestinian state by any means necessary. AIPAC's support of the illegal settlements is a means to a goal; AIPAC's goal is preventing Palestinian independence. When Oxfam severed its ties with the actress Scarlett Johansson after she contracted to be a spokesperson for an Israeli company that operated in an illegal Israeli settlement in the West Bank, here's what Oxfam wrote:Ms. Johansson's role promoting the company SodaStream is incompatible with her role as an Oxfam Global Ambassador.Less than a year later, SodaStream announced that it was ending its operations in the West Bank. Now Ahava Cosmetics, under similar pressure to SodaStream, is reportedly considering pulling out of the West Bank. This is the successful activism that AIPAC was trying use its power in Congress to shut down. This was the motivation behind the AIPAC provision that was defeated in the House on Friday. I am frequently asked: How powerful is AIPAC in Washington really? My answer: Not so powerful that it cannot be beaten -- if we choose our battles correctly."
