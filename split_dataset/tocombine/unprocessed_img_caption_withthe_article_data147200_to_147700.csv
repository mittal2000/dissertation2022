0,TECH,A Marketplace for Stronger Connections Between Neurons,"John Pavley, Contributor
CTO @ The Huffington Post, Blogger",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/a-marketplace-for-stronge_us_5bb368a9e4b0fa920b97f9dd,NextLesson is a web app where teachers and parents can get access to pre-designed lesson plans or create their own. It wasn't created by a 20-year-old to jump on the next big trend. It was created by a couple of dads using the ideas and techniques of high tech to solve a real problem in education.,2013-08-04,2013-08-04-NextLesson___Rational_Number_Projects_and_Lesson_Plans_in_All.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-08-04-NextLesson___Rational_Number_Projects_and_Lesson_Plans_in_All-thumb.png,"5 minute readA few months ago I was looking for advice about building a big data team. I contacted Parshu, one of the best search guys I've worked with. I was thinking in the back of my mind, if Parshu wasn't doing anything interesting, unlikely as that might be, perhaps I could talk him into working with HuffPost. After all we have tons of data, big and small! Parshu surprised me by explaining that he wasn't doing ""big data"" at all. He was working on a startup, designing a new product, coding a web application, and talking to parents and teachers. For a guy with hardcore Yahoo! and eBay search gigs on his resume this was the equivalent of a major league player coaching little league. Parshu Kulkarni and his co-founder Dion Lim, had discovered a more important game to play in and a much more important problem to solve than ranking keywords for search engines: Enabling teachers to grow stronger connections between the neurons in their young student's minds. Parshu and Dion had discovered project-based learning.Kids are doing more projects than ever these days -- at least in schools like the Synapse School and High Tech High. At these two California schools students focus on learning by doing and evaluation of what was done. This project-based focused is the result of decades of research on the effectiveness of doing projects versus memorizing facts and taking tests. As a former 6th grader I can tell you the test taking approach did not work for me. It was not until I got into art school, which is all about projects, that I learned how to learn for real. As a parent I've seen my kids deal with the same issues through the years. Memorizing hard facts, state capitals, times tables, and the elements of the periodic table helps you get good grades on a test but not deal with the complex, subtle, and squishy problems that you encounter throughout life. I've mostly forgotten everything I had to memorize in sixth grade. But I can't forget what I've learned in art school and what I've learned as a practicing programmer and CTO. I can talk your ear off about the minutia of the mobile software development or how to manage a team. Research shows that it's not that I'm rusty with my facts or that Google has made me lazy but rather that what students learn through doing a project creates a much larger footprint on their brains with stronger connections between neurons. But with more project-based learning comes a new problem: Managing all those projects! Parshu and Dion are both dads with school-aged children. Dion's kids had a tough time keeping track of their homework assignments. He devised a simple project management system on a whiteboard with magnets representing the progress his kids were making on each assignment. In the software development world we have many of these simplified project tracking tools using principles from agile, scrum, and kanban. But in education Parshu and Dion realized that both teachers and students were struggling without an easy to use and formalized tool to track lessons. Every teacher and student seemed to have their own ad-hoc approach to keeping up with their projects.Parshu and Dion created NextLesson to solve the project tracking problem and a couple more problems along the way. NextLesson is a web app where teachers and parents can get access to pre-designed lesson plans or create their own. Each lesson plan can have the following elements: A driving question, a description, a set of resources (images, documents, videos) that only the teacher can see, milestones, notes, and resources that the students can utilize. NextLesson makes it simple to keep a lesson plan organized and easily tracked as each milestone is accomplished.That's not all that NextLesson provides. It's also a place where teachers can sell lesson plans to each other (and to parents) or just give them away for free. Parshu and Dion talked to hundreds of teachers and designed the features of NextLesson to solve a broad range of issues around project-based learning: How are projects shared and discovered? How are projects paid for? How are projects licensed? How are projects used and reused?For me a big problem with our educational system is how poorly K-12 teachers are paid and how much they pay out of their own pockets for school supplies. It's estimated that teachers spend $1.3 billion out of their own pockets to teach our children. That number makes teachers heroes and shines a light on the terrible job we're doing as parents and taxpayers in making sure the money spent on education is enough and going to the right places.This is why NextLesson is a market place. Like an independent developer on Apple's App Store, an enterprising teacher can post a digital lesson plan for free or charge a fee. If the teacher decides to charge for her lesson plan she gets 70% of the fee. The pricing is up to the teacher. All of the lessons created in-house by NextLesson are free and teachers get a $5 credit for signing up. Hopefully, when buying lessons teachers will resist using their own money and ask the school to provide the funds. The fee for a lesson plan is usually between $5 to $10 and it's a lifetime purchase -- once a teacher purchases a lesson plan they can reuse it forever. That's the current strategy for NextLesson. It's not about getting rich on the backs of hard working teachers and parents but rather providing access to great content and rewarding teachers for their creativity.This strategy puts NextLesson right at the center of Internet education, crowd funding, and a marketplace for digital goods. It's not a Zynga-get-rich-by-addicting-users-to-trivial-content strategy. There are no ads on NextLesson. There are no gamification features. There is no fee for creating an account or for storing data. NextLesson was not created by a 20-year-old to jump on the next big trend. It was created by a couple of dads using the ideas and techniques of high tech to solve a real problem in education.I hope that NextLesson is part of a new wave in Internet education, like EdX and Skillshare, that offers unprecedented access to first class content without inflated brand-driven prices. And I can't wait until those kids with the strongly connected neurons start solving the real world problems that seem to be engulfing us."

Naturally, she had nothing to fear. In a rollicking set spanning much of her discography, Beyonce lived up to her royal nickname, playing Queen B to an eager audience that was more than happy to indulge her in celebrating herself. The show was chopped up by pre-filmed scenes and mini-movies, convenient yet intricate mood and tempo shifts that also allowed for the singer to cycle through her many outfits. The always regal clips most often saw the singer in the powder-faced look that accompanied the tour's announcement (a get up that's heavily influenced by Estonian singer Kerli), though the MIA-esque visuals for as of the still unreleased ""Grown Woman"" were a very welcome reprieve from the palace porn. Among the few surprises were a rework of ""If I Were a Boy"" that featured the instantly recognizable strings of The Verve's ""Bittersweet Symphony,"" Beyonce winking and jiggling her underarms when she mentioned her ""flaws"" and glimpses of dance-trap courtesy of Diplo's ""Express Yourself"" and Baauer's ""Harlem Shake."" At one point, she sang over the instrumental to ""Clique,"" a Kanye West, Jay Z and Big Sean song that Jay himself performed eight times during his arena-opening residency.Before launching into 2004's ""Naughty Girl,"" a sultry Beyonce voiceover accompanied footage of Beyonce dancing in a chair. The topic was sensuality: ""This gift can give you power,"" Beyonce teased. ""What will you do with this power? Would you let go? Would you surrender? I can make you surrender.""Indeed. The singer claimed her ""seduction"" was ""exclusive"" and that she ""chose"" the audience as her intended targets on Saturday, a promise that she made good on not so much by offering any over-sexualized, dancing come-ons, but by relentlessly returning to her own ""power,"" as a woman, a vocalist and a standing-in-the-ever-present-wind performer. Many singers, like Adam Levine and Rihanna, enthrall their fans by making the folks in the crowd believe, if only for a second, that they're the ones being sung about, seduced and desired. Beyonce, on the other hand, impresses by making it abundantly clear -- even while she's writhing around in apparent ecstasy while screaming, ""Make love to me!"" -- that she is definitely and absolutely not thinking about you.The power comes, in other words, from the emotional honesty of the moment -- she doesn't need to sing for you, because watching her sing for herself, her husband or her daughter is overwhelming enough. At certain points during Saturday's show (""Run the World,"" ""1+1,"" ""Irreplaceable,"" ""Survivor""), Beyonce convincingly lost herself in the moment, re-energizing a crowd that, while certainly excited at the prospect of seeing Destiny's one true child, still needed to be amped up. Her playful banter with Les Twins, her willingness to take flight from one side of the arena to another and her habit of sticking her microphone in the faces of people least capable of singing transformed what could have been a very impersonal if well-produced Instagram opportunity into a full-fledged experience. Late in the program, another mini-movie offered a greatest hits version of the singer's life, featuring clips of her kissing both daughter Blue Ivy and Barack Obama, performing at the Super Bowl, laughing with Destiny's Child bandmates Kelly Rowland and Michelle Williams and more. It's a bit odd for a performer to so often remind her fans of all her accomplishments, because these are people who paid a pretty penny to come see her -- they're down with the movement. But that's also sort of the whole point: A Beyonce concert is a powerful place where everyone believes a singer is a queen because the singer herself believes it more than anyone else. It's a beautiful thing."

It acquired the rights to the Troll toy franchise and in June, signed a deal to produce a TV series for streaming video service Netflix Inc. It also plans to build a $3 billion entertainment complex with partners in China.And Dreamworks isn't finished.""There will definitely be more deals,"" Chief Executive Jeffrey Katzenberg said in an interview. ""I have never seen more opportunities to build our brand in our 19 years in business.""Katzenberg will not say what else is on his list, or whether he prefers to buy or partner with other companies.One thing still percolating, he says, is a Dreamworks cable channel, ""but there's nothing out there right now for us.""A few years back, Dreamworks considered selling itself to a larger media company in hopes of converting its cable channel to one featuring Dreamworks movies or TV shows, according to news reports at the time.Dreamworks' acquisition spree comes at a time when the animated film market has become so saturated with studio-backed fare that the studio's most recent entry, ""Turbo,"" debuted with two other animated films already in the market.""Turbo"" ended up with lackluster ticket sales of $21 million in the United States and Canada during its first weekend. Earlier this year, Dreamworks took an $87 million write down for its holiday-themed ""Rise of the Guardians,"" and another $54 million charge to rework ""Me & My Shadow.""Dreamworks hopes acquisitions can help expand its popular franchises, such as ""Shrek"" and ""Kung Fu Panda,"" beyond the big screen to television, toys and even theme parks. It is a formula that helped turn Walt Disney Co into the largest media conglomerate, with a market value of $118 billion. Dreamworks is tiny in comparison, with a market value of about $2.3 billion.Investors have welcomed Katzenberg's diversification strategy, sending Dreamworks shares up 50 percent in the past year.As a result of dealmaking, analyst Tony Wible of Janney Montgomery Scott predicts about 45 percent of Dreamworks' revenue this year will come from non-movie making, including TV shows produced by Classic Media, which Dreamworks bought last summer for $157.6 million.Classic Media owns the rights to animated characters Richie Rich, Dick Tracy, and George of the Jungle, among others.A year ago, Wible said, Dreamworks was getting only about 15 percent of revenue from areas other than newly released films, with most of that coming from DVD sales of older movies.This year, Dreamworks expects to bring in $100 million in revenue from its television ventures. The estimate does not include revenue from AwesomenessTV, the teen-oriented YouTube network Dreamworks acquired in May.Over the next five years, Dreamworks says it will produce 1,200 hours of programs for companies such as Netflix and German kids channel Super RTL, including those inspired from ""Turbo"" and ""How to Train Your Dragon.""Dreamworks also will market merchandise from the Troll toy franchise after buying the rights to the line in April.In July, a Dreamworks attraction with a Disney-style character-parade and other entertainment opened at the Sands Cotai Central casino, owned by Sands China Ltd, in Macau.Dreamworks also is expanding in China, and is working with partners through a joint venture called Oriental Dreamworks to build a $3.1 billion entertainment district that will open in Shanghai in 2016. In addition, the venture will produce live-action movies and animated films for Chinese audiences.But Katzenberg, who headed Disney's movie studio for a decade until 1994, denies the flurry of deals is a bid to recreate a modern day version of the media giant's far flung entertainment empire.""Times have changed, this is totally different,"" he said. ""The thing we had in common were a great brand, some great content and a lot of opportunities to expand."""

(Photo by Araya Diaz/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2fb0424000050009737f5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Authorities’ strategy for holding bankers and Wall Street firms accountable for their role in the financial crisis is a bit misguided, according to Michael Lewis. The famed author, known for his chronicles of the financial industry in books like Liar’s Poker and the Big Short, called authorities’ response to the financial crisis “bizarre,” in a Friday Q&A with Vanity Fair. “The judicial response to the financial crisis, especially the criminal and legal response, has been bizarre,” Lewis told the magazine. “Insider trading, theft of property from a corporation, these are easier for them to take on and wrap their minds around than what was actually the center of the financial crisis.” The interview comes days after Vanity Fair published a piece by Lewis profiling Sergey Aleynikov, an ex-Goldman Sachs computer programmer sentenced to eight years in prison for stealing a piece of computer code from the bank. In the interview with the magazine, Lewis makes the argument -- articulated by other Wall Street critics -- that instead of focusing on the high-level executives and big banks at the heart of the crisis, authorities have focused on “peripheral” characters like Aleynikov in an aim to make it seem like they’re going after the financial industry without having to actually confront major players.There’s other news in recent days that adds credibility to Lewis’ argument. Ex-Goldman trader, Fabrice Tourre, aka “Fabulous fab,” was found liable of misleading investors on a toxic mortgage deal created by Goldman in the lead up to the financial crisis. The case, which was probably the highest-profile effort by the Securities and Exchange Commission to hold a banker accountable for their role in the meltdown, targeted someone who was just a mid-level employee of the firm.

10,ENVIRONMENT,Shark Cull Announced By France Follows Second Fatal Attack Off Réunion Island This Year,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/shark-cull-france-reunion-island-attack_us_5bb13fc3e4b09bbe9a5d2fab,"In one particularly dramatic attack last year, a shark grabbed a well-known champion surfer by the legs and stood him up",2013-08-03,A bull shark in Shark Reef off the Fijian island of Beqa.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb13fc33c000066000bc244.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"From TakePart's Richard Conniff: Authorities on the Indian Ocean island of Réunion have announced a plan to kill 90 sharks along its coastline, in addition to 24 already killed over the past year, in response to five human deaths from shark attacks there since 2011.George Burgess, director of shark research at Florida Natural History Museum and an expert on shark attacks, immediately denounced the killing program to GrindTV.com and later, in an interview with TakePart, as “an archaic, knee-jerk reaction that seems more borne of vengeance than of science.”Burgess warned that such revenge killings would do more to hurt the tourism trade on Réunion than the sharks themselves: “This likely will blow up in their faces because most visitors to Réunion have a more sophisticated conservation ethic than the authorities are apparently giving them credit for.”At the same time, the authorities also announced a seasonal ban on surfing across much of the island, according to Surfer magazine, which broke the story. This measure has caused further outrage among surfers, many of whom had lobbied in the past for a shark culling program, These controversial decisions came in the immediate aftermath of the latest killing. When 15-year-old Sarah Roperth decided to go snorkeling with a friend on a Monday afternoon two weeks ago, she chose a beach where she has been swimming all her life. According to the friend, who witnessed the attack, they were about 15 feet from the shore when the shark hit, instantly biting Roperth in half and carrying away part of her body. Fishermen sent out to hunt in the area immediately after the attack killed a tiger shark and two bull sharks, about eight to ten feet in length. Their stomachs contained no evidence of human remains.Roperth was the second person in Réunion killed by a shark this year, following the death in May of a 36-year-old surfer on his honeymoon. Worldwide, shark attacks have remained stable in recent years, though steadily rising as human populations and ocean recreation both increase. The global population of sharks has meanwhile sharply declined, because of the commercial killing of about 40 million sharks annually.The International Shark Attack File confirmed 80 unprovoked shark attacks on humans last year, seven of them fatal. Fifty-three occurred in the United States, a distant second is Australia with 14, and then South Africa with four. But Réunion, a much smaller place roughly the size and population (800,000) of Jacksonville, Florida, has seen three attacks in 2012, a disproportionately high number, thus causing the intense local reaction.In one particularly dramatic attack last year, a shark grabbed a well-known champion surfer by the legs and stood him up out of the water. Then a second shark broke the surface and bit into the victim’s torso. His body was never recovered.  The response to Roperth’s death has been remarkably inept. “We are deeply sorrowful about this terrible tragedy,” the island’s head of tourism announced, even before Roperth had been buried, “yet look forward to welcoming visitors to our beautiful island with a reminder to observe our local safety guidelines.” In other words, Come to Réunion, follow the rules (unlike these unfortunate victims) and you won’t get killed by a shark.Then last week, the island’s prefect, Jean-Luc Marx, announced an update to the planned shark kill. The program got started last year, ostensibly for scientific purposes. The original plan was to kill 20, and then 24, to check them for the presence of dinoflagellates, which can lead to ciguatera, a gastrointestinal and sometimes neurological illness caused by consuming certain contaminated fish. The disease can sometimes be fatal. In one outbreak on the nearby island of Madagascar, 98 people died after consuming a contaminated shark. But that shark was a small inshore species not known for human attacks, and the incident happened more than a decade ago. In any case, sale of sharks for food is already illegal on Réunion.George Burgess points out that the new killing program targets only the two dangerous shark species, tiger and bull sharks, and will take place only in the area where attacks on humans have occurred. “It’s pretty clear that they are having a focused kill under the guise of scientific research. It’s the equivalent of the mammal research that the Japanese and Norwegians use to justify killing whales.”A smarter solution, he adds, would be to bring in scientific expertise to figure out what changes in the environment, the shark population, or human behavior may be causing the concentration of shark attacks on Réunion. In other countries, that approach has led to practical solutions that simultaneously protect the sharks and also “the primary interest in tourism, and making money off the beach.”He says that in almost 40 years of shark research, he has never seen such a program of “wholesale killing sanctioned by a national government.” It’s more remarkable, he says, because the island operates under French law. “This is the biological equivalent of a lynch mob in the Old West, but in this case it’s being done by an arm of the French government. It’s quite embarrassing that an enlightened country like France would sanction something like this.”"

The painter, who is known for her rough-edged nude figures and distorted depictions of the life cycle, is turning 59 years old today.Dumas stands out as one of the most successful contemporary female artists to date, and her reach has expanded across the globe. She now sells pieces at auction for record-breaking prices. This summer, her is being shown as part of ""This Will Have Been: Art, Love & Politics in the 1980s,"" an exhibit on display at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. But it wasn't always so easy for the South African artist. ""Black Drawings,"" 1991-92In 1953, Dumas was born in Cape Town during the apartheid era. As a result, the Afrikaan-speaking Dumas, who demonstrated an early interest in photographs and cartoons, grew up in an environment that lacked an open, unregulated art culture. She only began to formally study painting at the city's university during the 1970s, drawn to various methods of representing the human form. It wasn't until 1976 that Dumas was able to fully experience the global art world. That year, the artist won a two-year scholarship to a small art school in Amsterdam that favored conceptual art. Her early work there consisted of abstract paintings and collage, veering far from oil painting, a medium heavily associated with the great Dutch masters. But her fascination with photographic forms, particularly the work of Diane Arbus, never left Dumas, and in 1984 she turned away from conceptual studies and instead toward the traditional style of figure painting. It was at this point that Dumas truly began her prolific career, producing her famous oil and watercolor portraits and nudes. While she made a decision to embrace the conventional methods of figure painting, the content of her work revolves around unconventional themes of sexual exploration and social identity. She depicts an array of subjects including terrorists, family members, and victims of physical violence, some equipped with the faces of menacing babies -- others with the bodies of zombie brides. Weighed down by layers of neutral paint and contained by harshly drawn lines, the artist creates visions of death and life that carry a surreal uneasiness.Dumas' focus on photography has persisted throughout her career, as she still draws inspiration from her personal catalogue of snapshots and Polaroids. Treating the canvas like a camera frame, she crops her images and adjusts their color palettes, creating new interpretations of the original source. Healthy subjects are transformed into figures on the verge of death as the artist emphasizes the psychological aspects that transcend the physical realities of her nudes and portraits. So in honor of Marlene Dumas' birthday, raise your glass to the painter as she turns 59 today. If you can't make it to Minneapolis to see her work, check out the slideshow of Dumas' work below. "
