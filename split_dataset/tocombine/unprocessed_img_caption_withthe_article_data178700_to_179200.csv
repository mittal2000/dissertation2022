2,IMPACT,Imagination as the Measure of Success,"Ken Wong, Contributor

How they feel about their lives. How they see their future. Rather than school scores, number of people tested, or increases in income, perhaps charity should use people's ability to imagine as the measure of success.If people can imagine their future, isn't that a good start? From Here to Where?  In 2009, our Face-to-Face AIDS Project gave the Malawi community of Chadika a very small grant to repair their office building. When we returned to Chadika in 2010, we asked that they show us their accounting -- even though no one in Chadika knew bookkeeping, no one had a calculator, and only a handful knew how to read and write. We studied each receipt in front of villagers, including the Group Village Headman (the GVH. Everyone was nervous.When we announced that they had spent $14 less than their grant amount (photo at right) -- and completing a nice renovation -- everyone broke out in huge smiles and applause. The grant had been used honestly and responsibly.I remarked that because Chadika had shown that they can carry out their grant obligations, they could become a role model community. Other villages would seek their advice, I predicted. People would think something exciting was going on in Chadika.My comments were received with puzzled looks. Surely something was being lost in  translation. After all, Chadika was so poor that people were dying of starvation and disease. There was no electricity, no running water, no economy to speak of. How could Chadika be a role model community? (Photo at right, Chadika asking for help in 2009)People hoped they'd receive maize seed and fertilizer, and help for those struggling with AIDS. Chadika, like most poor communities, were used to just asking and waiting for help. Projects that Help EveryoneOur next grant to Chadika included support for community maize gardens, targeted for those affected by old age or HIV and other diseases. Village headmen also participated in the gardens, as did those who volunteered with the local community group. Basic healthcare training for 40 participants was also part of the grant, so there would be some level of health knowledge in the community.Face-to-Face wanted to touch as many villagers' lives as possible through our grant. Even if the benefit was tiny, we wanted to be seen as inclusive -- we didn't want people to think that just a select few were receiving support. We also wanted everyone to know the exact amount of the grant, and how that money was being used. After all, money going to a place where there is no money can lead to mistrust, jealousy, and, of course, petty corruption. We didn't want to tempt that.Over the next two years, our small annual grant to Chadika expanded to include the creation of a youth group, increased farm activities in both the wet and dry seasons, bicycles, and ambulance bicycles. Something was happening in Chadika. Manure for the MindIn February 2012, we had our annual round of meetings at Chadika with community leaders, village headmen, and beneficiaries (photo, right). We called this week of meetings, ""All Eyes on Chadika,"" and we spent one day reviewing the projects, another day going over invoices and bookkeeping, two days to discuss new projects they wanted to do (and for us to respond with suggestions and budget limitations), and a final day reviewing everything. Here's a list of the projects they decided to do:  1. One-week leadership training for village headmen and community leaders 2. Bakery business and accounting training 3. Continuation of community garden, with training from organic agricultural facilitators 4. Farming and HIV facilitators for the youth group 5. Cassava planting during the dry season 6. Training in composting and making manure 7. Training in establishing a tree nursery 8. 2 bicycles to be shared among leaders 9. Basic census to determine population, disease prevalence, and general attitudesLooking over this range of projects, all of which amounted to less than $8,000, I commented that the focus was on learning, and not on specific items, such as seed and fertilizers. I lightheartedly summarized their grant as ""manure for the mind."" And to my surprise, everyone in the room laughed and went on to talk about the importance of learning.   Learning meant that a chief could know how to not use chemical fertilizers. That a committee can bake bread to feed the village orphans. That a woman can teach her neighbors how to dig a compost pile. So Chadika can delegate its youth with real responsibility and purpose. Just two years ago, Chadika leaders told me that composting would be met with skepticism, and that using human waste as fertilizer was something that Malawians would never do. Chadika now has 21 compost pits, and are looking for facilitators who can teach them about human waste manure. That's a project for 2013, for sure. Individual ImaginationIn August 2012, we had a one-day meeting at Chadika in which people stood up and talked about whatever they wanted. A grandmother observed that at first only women tended the compost pits, but now the men were enthusiastically digging new pits. A youth talked about the challenges of creating a group, and how they were going to restart after knowing which youth were most dedicated.  A village headman talked about how he learned in his leadership training that he must not charge a chicken when women come to him to resolve a petty dispute -- a headman's responsibility is to help his people get along and making one side pay when the matter wasn't so important could lead to ill will. A committee member declared they were going to use the profits from the bakery to self-fund another community garden.Last of all, the Group Village Headman (GVH, pictured with family at right) gave an impassioned speech. Chadika was already a role model community, he declared, because 40 new village chiefs had come to him to ask to join Chadika. Regardless if the next year brought drought, floods, inflation, or disease to the country, surely their Chadika would be better able to face these challenges. God willing these don't happen, he added, because that would allow his villagers a better chance to imagine how they could make Chadika a good place to live for everyone. May this continue so that his grandchildren -- of which there are a great many -- enjoy the good life in Chadika.  He, as the GVH, could see this happening.Collective ImaginationThe energy in our Chadika continues to be positive and hopeful. Everyone is respectful, with nary a trace of sarcasm or bad-mouthing. Everyone tries to think of new ideas on improving all aspects of village life, including food security, health, education, and human rights. Everyone tries to envision being self-reliant, without depending on things that are out of their control -- roads, electricity, a national economy. Can this imagination spread to residents who aren't in the room? (I think this is already happening.)Can they nurture a collective imagination among villagers that envisions a place where all are happy to live their lives?Can we Westerners imagine how Chadika residents -- free from capitalistic values and Western lifestyle perceptions -- might be closer to achieving a happier, healthier, more responsible community?I can imagine so.* * * * * * * * * * Ken Wong is the director of the Face-to-Face AIDS Project, a Brooklyn-based nonprofit helping impoverished communities in Malawi and Cambodia.

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2d1a6240000320055abbe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When President Barack Obama takes the stage this week at the Democratic National Convention, inside Charlotte's aptly chosen Bank of America Arena, he owes us an explanation for why the economy has been working so much better for financial behemoths than it has for ordinary people.He needs to enhance our understanding of why, nearly four years after he moved into the White House, millions of Americans are still threatened with the loss of their own homes. He needs to bring us up to speed on why tens of millions of working-age people are scrambling to find adequately paying jobs.He may well have a decent explanation to give us. He didn't create this bleak economy. He inherited it from a long line of irresponsible stewards: Ronald Reagan, who introduced the ruinous idea that prosperity comes via tax cuts; Bill Clinton, who allowed Wall Street to turn itself into Las Vegas-on-the-Hudson; George W. Bush, who made these problems immeasurably worse, while tacking on a couple of calamitous wars, financed with debt.Obama stepped in just as this disaster reached its worst proportions. He confronted the immediate catastrophe of the Great Recession, plus the financial crisis -- all layered atop a quarter-century of stagnant wage growth. That's a lot of problems to fix. One can reasonably argue that Obama managed it as well as anyone might have, and particularly in the face of obstructionist Republicans in Congress, who sabotaged recovery in pursuit of electoral gain.The roughly $800 billion package of stimulus spending measures that Obama unleashed made the job market better than it would have been without this infusion. That may not make for good campaign fodder -- ""Less Awful Than Otherwise!"" -- but it's still true.And as Michael Grunwald's terrific new book, ""The New New Deal,"" lays out convincingly, we are likely to reap the benefits of that stimulus package for many years via substantial public investments in renewable energy, education and infrastructure.Obama never promised a quick fix to a crisis that was at least a quarter-century in the making. ""The challenges we face are real, they are serious and they are many,"" Obama said in his inaugural address. ""They will not be met easily or in a short span of time."" The month in which he delivered those words, January 2009, saw the economy shed more than 800,000 net jobs, according to the Labor Department, bringing total job losses during the recession to more than 4.4 million. The losses would continue before bottoming out in February 2010. In the 29 months since, the economy has added more than 4 million jobs, or an average of 138,000 per month.That's not enough. It's not even enough to absorb new entrants to the labor force. It leaves millions of formerly middle class people staring at poverty. It leaves continued economic anxiety in virtually every community. But the relative improvement cannot be denied.And yet, anyone who has been paying attention has the right to ask whether recent years could have been much better, especially in light of the Obama administration's appalling failure to address the housing crisis, the single largest impediment to a vigorous recovery. Many experts understood before Obama took office that millions of borrowers owed the bank more than their homes were worth, and this put them in danger of sinking into foreclosure while depressing their spending, which in turn made employers reluctant to hire. This required a muscular program to write down loan balances. But the president listened to his Treasury Secretary, Timothy Geithner, who had just helped the Bush administration craft a $700 billion taxpayer-financed bailout of major financial institutions. Forcing those banks to absorb fresh losses by relieving homeowners was a no-go.This is how the Obama administration came to embrace a doctrine that has proven terrible both politically and economically: Bailouts for 'too big to fail' financial institutions, and token assistance for homeowners.What has President Obama -- who lacks neither intelligence nor analytical skills -- learned from his years in the White House, in terms of guiding the world's largest economy? We have little idea, and we ought to have more. He owes us a full accounting, along with a clear sense of what we can expect from a second term.Will he dispatch Ed DeMarco, the ideologue who oversees the government-controlled mortgage financiers, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and who has refused to allow them to write down loan balances for distressed homeowners?Will he give us a Treasury secretary who serves the taxpayer and working people, rather than the interests of Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase?What can we hope for on the job-creation front? Or should we simply accept that what we have in the way of policy is all that we are going to get? If this is because of the impossibility of dealing with Congress, what lessons has Obama divined from tangling with Republicans on Capitol Hill, and how would he apply them going forward?On all of these subjects, your guess is as good as mine.The president has talked little about such things because he has been busy reveling in the feast of political roadkill that is the Romney campaign -- a ceaseless run of inane statements served up by the candidate, making him look like an out-of-touch and insensitive rich guy, all reinforced by his refusal to offer up his tax returns.This has provided great theater if you're a Democrat. It has surely aided Obama's reelection prospects, reinforcing the central idea of his campaign, that this election is a choice between an America run by and for plutocrats, and one governed in the interest of people worried about paychecks and retirement savings. But it has also deprived us of enlightenment on the internal lessons of Obama's first term and how he would proceed if given a second. It is said with legitimacy that Romney's only hope for victory rests on the campaign being dominated by talk of the economy. He wins if and only if he can make the election a referendum on Obama's economic record. But forget Romney and his personal prospects. The nation as a whole needs a serious discussion about the chronically weak economy, for the simple reason that this is the defining issue of these times.Maybe Obama delivered the best lift he could, given the toxic politics of Washington. Maybe he erred and can do better. In any event, we are due an accounting of how the president sees his own record, in order to assess his plans for another go. And given the suffering that much of the country has endured while watching the wealthiest and most powerful prosper, we are owed such an accounting."

""But they were the only way for us to do what we were on the way to doing, which is coming out of bankruptcy with a city that is now functional.""The city never missed a payment on its $19 million of currently outstanding general obligation bonds, but that is of little comfort to those who are bearing the cost of the rescue.""We've been pilfered and beaten down,"" said Bruce Ogni, president of the Central Falls police retirees organization. ""We didn't have the power, the money, to fight it.""The cuts drove home the message to public sector pensioners in other Rhode Island cities that if they didn't agree to renegotiate their retirement benefits, they could be facing even steeper cuts if their city goes bankrupt. In Providence, the state capital, retirees agreed this June to major changes to help the city avert bankruptcy. BORROWING ABILITY PRESERVEDCentral Falls is a city of about 19,400 people, 60 percent of them Latino, crammed into 1.2 square miles. Over time, as elsewhere in Rhode Island, it lost its textile mills and factories. A quarter of its residents live below the poverty line - twice as many as the state average - and the median household income is just under $34,400.In some places, grass pushes through cracks in sidewalks in front of boarded up triple-decker, multi-family homes. Elsewhere, stately churches and tidy bungalows anchor neat streets.In the spring of 2010, Central Falls was facing insolvency due to steep cuts in state aid, revenue shortfalls - and an unfunded liability of about $80 million for pension and retiree health benefits. The city had revenue collections of about $16 million but expenses topped $21 million.That May, the city asked to be put into judicial receivership, and the municipal bond market and credit rating agencies bristled.In response, state lawmakers quickly passed two different laws that preserved Central Falls' ability to continue borrowing, as well as the state's reputation in credit markets.One law protected bondholders, giving them a lien on property tax revenue. The other established a three-tier system - a fiscal overseer, a budget commission and a receivership - for the state to intervene in financially distressed cities.""Access to the credit markets ... is extremely important, and given the size of Rhode Island, we did not want Central Falls to have some kind of contagion impact on our other communities,"" said Rosemary Booth Gallogly, director of the Rhode Island Department of Revenue, who orchestrates the state's oversight of distressed municipalities.The way Rhode Island stepped in ""reflects positively"" on the state and its municipalities' creditworthiness, said Alan Schankel, who runs municipal bond research for Philadelphia-based Janney Montgomery Scott.Janney holds some Rhode Island bonds and has provided financing for both stable and struggling local municipalities there, Schankel said.In California, it took three years and about $10 million in legal fees to get the city of Vallejo out of bankruptcy in August 2011. This summer saw two other major municipal bankruptcies there, Stockton and San Bernardino, where bondholders could take haircuts.Both California and Rhode Island have among the widest yield spreads on 10-year, top-rated municipal bonds, according to Municipal Market Data, a unit of Thomson Reuters. But California, one of the largest borrowers on the U.S. municipal bond market, has a yearly average of around 87 basis points, well above the 54 basis point of Rhode Island.SMALLER WORKFORCE, PENSIONS SLASHEDMayor Charles Moreau started cutting the city's workforce after asking for a judicial receiver in May 2010. City employees now total 116, down from 174.The city's only community center was shut, cutting 32 positions. The library was also closed, reopening later under nonprofit management.While positions were cut, base salaries rose. On average, city employees made $41,650 annually before the bankruptcy. Today, Central Falls employees earn an average base salary of $47,500. And they'll get annual 2.5 percent raises for at least the next five years, said Gayle Corrigan, the receiver's chief of staff.The city's 133 retirees had their pensions cut by up to 55 percent, with pensioners now getting an average of $16,626 a year. The state allocated $2.6 million to soften the blow for the next five years. SOME STILL STUNGCentral Falls' bankruptcy left its elected officials powerless. Even in January when state officials think they can hand the reins back to city council members and the mayor, the bankruptcy case will continue in court and the state will retain oversight, allowing it to step back in if local elected officials veer from the five-year budget plan.""I don't know how much they're going to let us do,"" said city council president William Benson Jr. ""We just have no authority and no power.""The city council is still embroiled in a legal battle against the state for taking over. The mayor did not return a call seeking comment, and no one answered the door at his home last week.Local taxpayers will foot the bill for the fees and costs for the receivership and bankruptcy, which will top $3 million. Included in that figure is $97,000 associated with the cost of drafting the state legislation, and the cost of the receivership.NOT OUT OF THE WOODSSeveral Central Falls' residents said they haven't noticed much difference because of the bankruptcy.Rafael Brandon, 41, said firefighters responded immediately when his family's home caught fire in July. ""They're pretty good. When you call them, they show up quickly,"" he said, adding that police are equally responsive.But Benson, from the city council, said that Central Falls is not really out of the woods.The city's total gross assessed property value dropped to about $524 million from nearly $804 million between fiscal years 2010 and 2011. Even so, with the annual 4 percent property tax hikes through 2017, Central Falls expects its revenue collections to grow from $16.6 million in fiscal 2013 to $19.8 million in 2017.Thomas E. Cawley Jr., 85, and his wife Bernadette will be paying those increased property taxes on the home in which they've lived for 55 years.Cawley was a Central Falls police officer for 26 years, retiring as a sergeant in 1986, the same year Rolling Stone magazine labeled the city the biggest cocaine hub in the Northeast.At his dining room table, Cawley gazes through thick glasses at a pile of letters. One, from September 2011, informed him that after making payments for a $20,000 life insurance policy for 24 years, his policy had been canceled as part of the city's austerity plan.Cawley's annual pension payment was slashed to $18,274 from $27,073 and his health insurance was moved to Medicare from Blue Cross at a cost to him of $100 a month.He, like other Central Falls employees, gets no Social Security benefits from his city job, though he receives about $6,000 a year in Social Security payments from old part-time jobs.He and his wife are angry, but the retirees didn't have the money or power to fight it, they said. ""We have to live on what we're getting,"" he said. ""What else can you do?"""

[See: IDnL2E8K12JU]Among firms subpoenaed, in addition to Bain, were KKR & Co LP, TPG Capital LP, Apollo Global Management LLC and Silver Lake Partners LP, a source told Reuters.Schneiderman is investigating ""management fee waivers,"" in which private equity managers convert portions of their pay into investment income, reducing the tax rate on that pay to 15 percent. That is the same rate they pay for ""carried interest,"" a related form of investment gain that the managers get from the business of buying, managing and selling companies.The tax status of carried interest has drawn fire for years from Democrats in the U.S. Congress who argue the gains should be taxed as ordinary income. T he private equity industry and their allies have blocked such a change, arguing that carried interest carries risks and deserves investment tax treatment.A spokesman for the U.S. Internal Revenue Service said on M onday the agency had no immediate comment on the issue.The private equity industry's role in the economy and its tax status have become political issues in the 2012 presidential campaign because Bain Capital was co-founded and once led by Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate hoping to unseat President Barack Obama in the Nov. 6 election.Romney's campaign said he did not take part in the fee-waiver program. Bain declined to comment.The IRS said in November 2007 it was studying tax techniques used by alternative investment firms, including private equity.""The service never said anything after that,"" said Francois Hechinger, a partner in the private equity tax practice at accounting firm BDO in California. ""This is becoming a controversial issue.""It is unknown if the IRS audited private equity funds to investigate management compensation. It is also unclear why the IRS took no public action.A tax lawyer who was at the IRS in 2007 said the firms' pay structures are complex, posing a challenge for IRS auditors. TWO AND TWENTYThe tax issue centers on the disparate treatment given under U.S. law to income from wages, taxed at a top rate of 35 percent, and that applied to investments, taxed at 15 percent.Private equity managers typically get a ""2-and-20"" compensation package. This consists of a 2 percent management fee, taxed as ordinary income, and a 20 percent share of fund profits, taxed as capital gains at 15 percent.The 2 percent fee is guaranteed income that defrays some of the risk associated with investing. But managers may waive the fee and convert it to income that benefits from the lower tax rate.Experts such as Hechinger defend the fee-waiver strategy because of the increased risk to which the income is subject. ""You're taking a risk - there is no certainty you're going to have income in the life of the fund,"" Hechinger said.Others say it is not so clear. Critics argue that fee waiver is a tax loophole.""The IRS hasn't issued any notice (about the 2007 inquiry) and it is kind of a puzzle to me why they haven't,"" said Victor Fleischer, a law professor at the University of Colorado, among those who first highlighted the tax technique. ""It has been this open secret in the private equity world."" DEMOCRATS TRIED PREVIOUSLYThe timing of the probe and Schneiderman's credentials as a Democrat could raise eyebrows in political circles.Romney has not said how he would handle the issue, but Ryan voted several times against the Democrats' bid to change the tax treatment in the House.Fleischer, a critic of the tax strategy, said a 2006 Romney financial disclosure shows more than $1 million in income from a Bain fund that has received converted management fees.On the broader issue of carried interest, Democrats have been trying for years to close what they see as a tax break. They came closest in 2010 when they controlled the House of Representatives, the Senate and the White House.Still, they failed, in large part because some Senate Democrats tried to carve out exceptions for certain industries.After the upcoming elections, wide-ranging tax code reform is seen by some on Capitol Hill as a possibility in 2013.The private equity industry appears likely to feature in the debate.

But it stopped paying most of its debts six months later as the economy collapsed.A local court has been investigating the swap for more than 10 years to see if Argentine officials committed any crime when they hired banks to carry out the swap. Former Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo and former Finance Secretary Daniel Marx have been charged in the case, which has yet to go to trial.Mulford was first called to testify in the probe in 2002 but he has never done so, according to court documents cited by the Telam news agency.Argentine officials have ""made numerous attempts by all possible legal means to achieve David Mulford's compliance, in this country's territory as well as through U.S. authorities, and all of these have invariably failed,"" the documents stated.Cavallo said in the past that Mulford was one of the main engineers of the swap.Mulford worked at the U.S. Treasury from 1984 to 1992 and was at the center of international economic negotiations under former U.S. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush.He later served as the U.S. ambassador to India."
