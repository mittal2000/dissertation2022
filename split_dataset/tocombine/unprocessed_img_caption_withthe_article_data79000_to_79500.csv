It's supposed to celebrate the workers who built America and fought for their rights, etc. For instance, we can no longer hire nine-year-olds to work 60 hour work weeks.Nine-year-olds were really bad at building bridges, for instance.And I'm glad that workers made railroads, buildings, bridges, etc. For the life of me, I can't figure out how that's done. It's like making fire. Who was the first to figure out how to make a bridge?It's a rhetorical question because I don't care.I drive over them. I listen to music and I don't care who made guitars. I read books and I don't know, for instance, who made paper.Somebody worked.Maybe they got a medal or a trophy. Or made a lot of money.And then laws were made and them someone said we should have a holiday.A day off.Be honest: Labor Day only means one thing right now. And no matter how old you are, you still feel it deep in your gut:School is about to start and then your life is over.I haven't been to a ""school"" since I was thrown out of graduate school 23 years ago.And yet even the thought of Labor Day gives me this post-traumatic, sick-in-the-stomach, bored-of-hyphens feeling that I'm about to be put in prison again.The beatings will begin. Homework will begin. Teachers will discipline me. Parents will yell at me over letters in a quarterly assessment of my value as a human being. The wet boots that I can't take off.I still have dreams that I didn't do homework and it's too late to back out. F. EFFFF!!!And then it gets worse. MUCH worse.They take the word ""homework"" and they remove the phrase ""home"" from it. There's no more fooling around. We're not home anymore! We were fooled!Once Labor Day happens, summer is over and real WORK begins.Oh my god, I hate work so much.I hate when my hair is wet from rain outside and I'm feeling dirty and tired and I have to walk to my cubicle and say hi to people I run into because there's absolutely no path I can take to avoid people.Then there's that first meeting of the day. Everyone sitting around a conference room table, everyone thinking how they can look good.I passed the time thinking how many women around the conference room table were having sex just a few hours earlier. Was she? Did she?When I was four years old and on my way to my first day of nursery school my dad even warned me: first it's this, then kindergarten, then school for 12 years, then college, then graduate school, then you work for 40 years, then you can retire.I started crying and he was never able to console me. Then 30 years later he died at work.Here's a story that is the CENTRAL CORE of my work life right now and I think can be the central core for anyone who wants it, who visualizes it, who moves towards it.Story: there's a fisherman who fishes all day, cooks the fish, eats with his family, plays the guitar with his friends, goes to sleep.A Harvard MBA comes up to him and says, ""you have a great business here. We can expand and sell fish into all the different markets, then franchise and manage a big business.""The fisherman says, ""Why would I want to do that?""The Harvard MBA says, ""well then in 20 years you can have an IPO.""The fisherman says, ""Why would I want to do that?""The Harvard MBA says, ""well then you would have millions of dollars. Imagine what you could do with that money!""So the fisherman did imagine: he would wake up early, he would fish all day, he would cook the fish for his family, and then he'd go out and play the guitar with his friends.End of story. ---My new book, THE RICH EMPLOYEE, is out.

(ATI) specialty mills.These 2,200 Steelworkers are not on strike. They never even took a strike vote to threaten a walkout.ATI locked them out of their jobs.ATI threw them out of the mills on Aug. 15 even though the Steelworkers clearly told the corporation that they were willing to work – that they wanted to work – while negotiating a new labor agreement.A lockout like this is a weapon increasingly deployed by corporations to injure workers, families and communities. And corporations are doing it even as workers engage in significantly fewer strikes. The growing use of lockouts to force workers to accept corporate demands demonstrates that the already powerful – corporations – have secured even more might in their relationship with workers. Corporations’ lopsided hold on power in the United States has suppressed labor unions and contributed significantly to wage stagnation and income inequality.USW District Director David McCall holds Marlee Grinage, daughter of Steelworker Jaimee Grinage, aloft at Steelworker rallyA century ago, the power imbalance between corporations and workers looked like Jabba the Hutt commanding one end of a seesaw and Yoda clinging to the other. By the 1930s, workers fumed about this inequity and labor unrest was rampant. In 1935, Congress passed the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) encouraging collective bargaining and giving a little weight to the workers’ end of that seesaw.For several decades, workers organized and secured gains in pay and benefits. By the 1960s, a third of the U.S. workforce was unionized. Because organized workers had the power to win labor agreements calling for better wages, income inequality declined significantly from its peak in 1929. Thirty years after the NLRA passed, CEOs earned about 20 times the pay of average workers. Since the day the NLRA took effect, though, corporations lobbied to recover the small measure of power Congress gave workers. Congress, courts and too many state legislatures complied with corporate demands, handing them more muscle in their dealings with workers.As a result, now only 11 percent of U.S. workers are represented by labor unions, about the same portion as before the NLRA passed. The number of strikes in a given year is down to a sixth of what it was just two decades ago. Income inequality is back to 1929 levels. CEOs now pull down nearly 300 times what workers get.ATI is an example. It locked out workers to force them to accept massive benefit cuts. Just one year ago, however, it handed its top management team raises of up to 70 percent, so that the top five executives pulled down more than $19 million.Between 1978 and 2013, corporations increased compensation for their CEOs by 937 percent, while raising worker pay a paltry 10.2 percent.The situation worsened for workers recently. A study by the National Employment Law Project released last week found that considering inflation, median worker wages actually fell by 4 percent between 2009 and 2014.This occurred even while worker productivity increased. Another report released last week, this one by the Economic Policy Institute, shows that the benefits of better productivity have nearly all gone to corporations, shareholders and top executives. Workers produced more and got less. Instead of investing in workers, research and development, corporations are increasingly spending virtually all profits on stock buybacks, a practice that increases CEO compensation. Corporations are using lockouts to try to take even more from workers. That’s what the Minnesota company American Crystal Sugar did. It was earning record profits, yet demanded concessions from workers. When the 1,300 members of the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Union said they wanted a fair share of the wealth that their labor had created, the company locked them out on Aug. 1, 2011.American Crystal Sugar contracted Strom Engineering to find replacement workers. That’s the same company ATI hired in an attempt replace its hardworking, highly-skilled Steelworkers. American Crystal Sugar paid the inexperienced replacement workers more than it did its veteran workers – just as ATI is doing.They’re willing to do that because their goal is eventually to kill the union, just as robber baron Andrew Carnegie and his henchman Henry Clay Frick did in 1892 when they locked workers out of the Homestead Steel Works.That lockout cost the lives of six steelworkers and at least four Frick-hired Pinkerton guards. But Frick and Carnegie didn’t care about that. In the end, with the help of troops sent by the state, they got what they wanted – the ability to impose wage cuts and hazardous working conditions with no threat of pushback from organized workers.In Minnesota, after 22 months locked out, a slim majority of Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Union members voted to accept the concessions American Crystal Sugar demanded. That seemed to give the company what it wanted – the ability to more easily stuff into the fists of executives all the sweet profits produced by the hands of labor. But the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers Union is fighting back to protect its members.Labor is not down for the count. Far from it. Check out the thousands of Steelworkers who rallied in Pittsburgh, Chicago and Burns Harbor last week, demanding fair contracts from ATI, U.S. Steel and ArcelorMittal. Check out the success of the Fight for Fifteen movement, strongly supported by the Service Employees International Union and other labor groups. Check out the polls showing surging support for labor unions.Larry Curry, 61, drove from Maple Heights, Ohio, to Pittsburgh to join the Steelworkers’ rally last week. The retiree from ArcelorMittal said he was making a stand. He explained, “The corporations are getting greedier and greedier. They want to give us peanuts. If we continue like this, with them cutting everything, we can’t take care of our families.”Carl LeDonne, 48, a Teamster, joined the Steelworker rally because he felt he had to defend unions against the current corporate assault on labor. “We can’t give away what my dad’s generation fought and died for,” he said as he marched on Grant Street. “They are coming after all of us. Today it is the Steelworkers under attack, tomorrow it is my union. They want to destroy all unions and force people to work for $2 an hour, 80 hours a week, like a Third World country.”Eric Martin, 45, of Fombell, a member of the International Union of Operating Engineers, marched in the rally because he believes the ATI lockout specifically, and lockouts in general, are attacks on workers. “Corporations are trying to break anyone who they think is standing in their way. I am standing with my brothers in this struggle,” he said.As the rally began at the United Steelworkers (USW) International Headquarters on the Boulevard of the Allies in Pittsburgh, David McCall, who is Director of USW District 1, held aloft 7-year-old Marlee Grinage, daughter of Steelworker Jaimee Grinage. “This is what this fight is all about,” McCall said. “It is about a decent future for our children!”On this Labor Day, with the public at its back, organized labor demands an end to lockouts and to this new age of robber barons who impose them.

Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn joined to blame the supposed uptick on ""self-styled activist"" voices and a ""relentless propaganda war"" against police from ""our network television stations."" A series of high-profile shootings of unarmed black men by police officers over the past year have highlighted racial tensions and disparities in policing. But there is no recent upward trend in the killing of police officers, according to data collected by the Officer Down Memorial Page, which tracks police deaths. In 2011, the number of police deaths in line of duty caused by gunfire or stabbing totaled 70. That number dropped to 53 in 2012 and 33 in 2013, before rising to 47 in 2014. Thus far in 2015, 24 officers have been killed by gunfire or stabbing, on pace for a lower number than in 2014.Overall homicide rates have, however, increased this year in a host of major cities, according to The New York Times. Flynn blamed that rise in killings on lax gun laws, saying that too many convicted criminals have access to firearms.""A number of us have suffered from recently weakened gun laws that have made it much easier for our criminals to gain access to firearms,"" Flynn said. ""When the major cities met a few weeks ago, all of us noticed the phenomenon -- a lot more rounds are being fired at each shooting and overwhelmingly being driven by people with criminal records shooting people with criminal records. That's driving our homicide rates."" "

But a new protest movement in the country's Shiite-dominated south is a key sign that Tehran's power is waning, as Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani and Maliki's U.S.-backed successor, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, make forceful moves to reclaim Iraqi independence. Much of Iraq is no longer under the control of the central government in Baghdad. The Islamic State militant group rules large swathes of the Sunni region to the west, and Kurds control their own autonomous region in the northeast. In the Shiite-majority sections of Iraq, however, including Baghdad and the areas to its south and east, a political confrontation with Iran is underway just as the Islamic Republic is engaging the international community like never before through a historic nuclear agreement.Iraq watchers believe that a popular protest movement calling on Abadi to better handle public services and government corruption is a subtle indication that Iraqis want to beat back Iranian influence in their country.Sistani's position is a key indicator to follow, those watchers told The Huffington Post. U.S. officials have, in secret documents released in 2011 by Wikileaks, spoken of Sistani as the ""greatest political roadblock"" for Iranian operatives in Iraq. The Iranian-born ayatollah has unquestioned authority in Iraq and a very different approach to politics from his Iranian counterparts, disavowing their view of a theocratic government or ""Wilayat al-Faqih,"" the rule of the Islamic jurist.Sistani is based in Najaf, the spiritual capital of the Shiite branch of Islam. After the Iranian revolution of 1979, influence over the global Shiite community shifted from Najaf to Iran's chief religious center of Qom -- in large part because Iraq was ruled by a Sunni minority regime led by Saddam Hussein. But following the U.S. invasion in 2003, power -- and what's thought to be millions in funds from religious tourism and Shiite devotees around the world -- began to flow back to Najaf, historically the more significant site. Sistani and Iran have had a fragile alliance in the years since, one that's been threatened recently because the Iraqi ayatollah has implied that he blames the Iranian client Maliki for losing ground to the Islamic State.An American source who has worked for years with the Iraqi government said that frustration with Iran helps to explain Sistani's groundbreaking decision last year to call up Shiite ""volunteers"" to join militias battling Islamic State forces. ""One of the reasons Sistani called up the militias was to keep the Iranians out,"" the source told HuffPost. ""He's also trying to push Iranians out of the governance structures.""Iran's clout manifests itself in many ways. They include Tehran's control of a number of the Shiite militias in Iraq, the role of top Iranian General Qassem Suleimani in providing arms for those militias and for the Iraqi army, and Iranian support for a number of top Shiite political figures.For Sistani and other players in Iraq who would like to see that influence diminished, the protest movement has created an opening, according to an Iraqi government official who spoke to HuffPost on condition of anonymity.""It's clear that Najaf is very determined to maintain its independence from Iran. Najaf felt it was an opportunity to ride off the back"" of the protest movement, the official said.Sistani called on Abadi last month to respond to the protest movement's demands in a message delivered in an important Friday sermon.""The government listens to every word of what Najaf says very, very carefully. Every Friday, everyone is listening very closely"" to Sistani's prayer message, the Iraqi official told HuffPost.And Abadi has responded, eliminating a number of government positions -- including that of vice president, costing Maliki the job he gained after U.S. pressure and opposition at home led to his resignation last year. In the Iraqi parliament, there have been calls for Maliki to face trial over his loss of the city of Mosul to Islamic State forces.Iran's powerful proxies in Iraq are pushing back. The leaders of two of the most powerful and brutal Shiite militias, the Iraqi Hezbollah and the Badr Organization, visited the chief judicial authority recently, reports Kimberly Kagan of the Institute for the Study of War. ""The Iranian-backed militias, including Kata’ib Hezbollah, the Badr Organization, and Asa’ib Ahl al-Haq, all have a vested interest in thwarting PM Abadi’s reforms, especially the attempt to eliminate the vice presidential positions and thereby expel VP Nouri al-Maliki, who has been aligning himself with the militias for months,"" Kagan wrote in a Sept. 3 post.Kagan, a former adviser to U.S. generals in Iraq and Afghanistan, suggested that the Iranian-backed militia leaders hoped to pressure Iraq's judiciary and its president into stalling the reforms.But it looks like Sistani, Abadi and other Iran skeptics are gathering a loose coalition of their own to resist these efforts.Not all of Iraq's Shiite militias support Iran, noted Phillip Smyth, an expert on Shiite militias at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and author of the Hizbollah Cavalcade blog on Jihadology.net. Many agree with Sistani in opposing the Iranian ideology of theocratic rule.That presents an opportunity for the American military planners who are closely watching Iraq as they to identify which partners to work with against the Islamic State -- and who have for months been worried, U.S. officials told HuffPost, that their personnel in Iraq would be vulnerable not only to Islamic State forces but to Iran-backed militants.""It wouldn't surprise me if those in the Department of Defense are looking to liaise if not offer some support for [militias] which are both truly Iraqi nationalist and are not proxies of Tehran,"" Smyth told HuffPost in an email.The Iraqi population itself may now be galvanized by the latest protest movement to start thinking about the interests of their state rather than those of the various sects, said Iraqi-American activist Zainab Al-Suwaij.As the executive director of the American Islamic Congress, Al-Suwaij runs conflict resolution centers in Iraq and is in touch with political actors on the ground.""After the demonstrations in Baghdad and elsewhere throughout the country, the sectarian issue between the Sunnis and the Shiites has become less than before,"" Al-Suwaij told HuffPost. ""It's not about feeling that the Shiites are in control -- the Shiites are also complaining about corruption.""Major political parties have been forced to bow to street pressure and rush to enact reforms, she noted. And she predicted that this time, unlike in the past, Iran will not be able to protect them from popular dissent.""Iran is no longer as strong as they used to be,"" Al-Suwaij said.  CORRECTION:    An earlier version of this story incorrectly identified Phillip Smyth as the founder of Jihadology.net. In fact, Smyth is a contributor to the site and the author of its Hizballah Cavalcade blog."

Yes, that's right. No more ""I'm tired"" grumbles at 3 p.m. at the office. No more yelling at cars that cut me off on 440. No more snapping at people for not listening. The highlight of the two week period? I validated that I'm not a terrible, negative person, AND optimistic people tend to live longer according to some studies. And I'm optimistic enough to believe these studies are the correct studies. So here you go: The top five things that occurred when I stopped complaining, both the good and the bad.1. I realized that I don't sleep enough. The biggest complaint that I had to bite my tongue on?""I'm tired."" Or a variation of ""I'm exhausted."" American culture leaves us seeking to thrive off of no sleep and Starbucks. And is it really worth it to feel that negativity quite literally every day? I found myself almost getting annoyed with myself for being so tired. On the same note, I annoyed myself when I felt like uttering the complaint, ""I'm starving."" No, Alexii. You don't actually know what it really means to be hungry (so maybe you aren't THAT tired either). 2. I argued less: I'm not exactly one to pick a fight, but I noticed how many stupid arguments I can have in a week. If my fiancé Alex said something I disagreed with, I couldn't immediately react. This helped me not snap -- and more importantly it made me think before anything came out of my mouth. I'm pretty sure we've been told since kindergarten, ""Think before you speak"" but I noted how often I neglect this simplest piece of advice. 3. Angst builds up. Here's the deal: this experience was overall a positive experience for me. It truly made me reflect on my reactions to situations. That being said, sometimes people just need to vent. There was one day that I came home completely exhausted and slightly emotionally distraught. Instead of engaging in conversation with my friend that was at my house or my fiancé, I straight up shut down. It's almost as if I didn't know how to be positive in that moment. It was strange. And I went to bed early that night. But on a lighter note...4. Negativity is a state of mind: When you stop yourself from uttering negative speech, you begin to notice how negative your thought process tends to be. Sure I didn't verbally complain when I was tired or annoyed -- but I still continued thinking them. And as much as negative speech can wear you down, negative thoughts are just as dangerous.  5. I prayed more. If I was forced to turn the negative into the positive, I turned to God. Perhaps its from prior experience--but for whatever reason, it happened. And my spirit felt nourished. And at the end of the day? Shit happens. After my fast from complaining, I had what may have been one of the worst days I had experienced. Imagine tough conversations that were draining but necessary (and even worse after the conversation, nothing was resolved) compiled with other people's negativity. Then add a few ""first world"" problems as I like to call them -- a poor night's sleep, a shattered phone, and a stalling car. What did I do? I complained. Where did it get me? Not too far. I noted a day later that things really aren't that bad. People have good days and people have bad days -- but the truth is? It's all about your outlook."

But there are far better reasons for this so called lagging that those claims declare.Surely our fast-paced rhythm has changed through the years, because we realize that careless choices have consequences we no longer wish to bear. Our slowing steps are made with intention, so that we may embrace the moment more fully.We have realized that time is something of value, so we are more liberal with our No's and selective with our Yes's. We are aware of our needs, and we're not afraid to meet them.We've learned that life is to be cherished, as we have felt the tragic sting of loss.Our timeline has taught us that busy doesn't deem us worthy, it only satisfies a perpetual desire we no longer have.Maybe we have learned that some battles aren't worth our energy or emotional expense. At this stage of the game, we live with resolve in who we are and where we've been- and we've learned that caring for oneself is mandatory. There's no need for pushing so hard it hurts, and no desire to defend the very definition of who we are. But we are strong enough to stand up for what we believe in, with the magnificent combination of integrity and humility -- both of which come with age.We have already paced that path of acceptance, landing safely in our place. There is peace in knowing who you are, and when that ground has been established, there simply is no need to tire ourselves in defending it. We have the ability to step back and take in the big picture, so we no longer pick apart the gritty details of another life -- but rather take in the view and contemplate a new perspective.No, we haven't slowed down because of our weariness or exhaustion from the years.It's simply quite the opposite.We have been made aware of moments that we may have missed, and now we are more deliberate in our decisions. We pause to reflect more on those gifts we once recklessly threw to the wind. We discover more depth in our view, and understand more fully the meaning of our purpose. There is no need for sprinting, as we have finally figured out that life is a marathon and slow and steady truly does win the race. There is more to fulfillment than speed, we say.There's the richness in taking it slow, and delicately handling every morsel of time as though it were hard earned and must be savored.We are inspired by thoughts that render action. We know where passion thrives and how to nourish it. Through the years, we have discovered that giving is more gratifying than getting. So we invest in others and support their cause. It may be that we ourselves have become leaders in our own mission, with a fierce fire that drives our plan. We have learned to navigate, delegate, and operate under difficult circumstances. We are masters of our domain, and we function more efficiently because we have learned what works and what doesn't.With these years, comes wisdom and with wisdom comes insight. Oh, the beauty in seeing beyond facades and focusing our eyes on what matters most. And although we can still run with the best of them, we stop to inhale the sweet life and all its fragrant surroundings.You see, this is when the years become more about living than counting...We still have the physical aptitude to experience everything we desire, and we've reached a point in our lives where we truly cherish it. We don't live recklessly, running toward the goal -- whatever that may be. We live miraculously; stretching toward the greatness of a life well lived.There are dreams we have chased and perhaps caught. There are others we have let go. But we have slowly discovered that grace is more powerful than glory. And empowerment comes from within. So we dare to take risks as we carefully plan our course, and know deep down that the steps we take are to be celebrated, not hurried.Failure and mistakes have become stepping stones rather than a harbor for self-hate. We have finally concluded that growth happens in the hardest places, so for that -- we are grateful.There are hidden truths we uncover that come with time. And when we find them, we can appreciate our strength and stamina and speed in completely different ways.Actually, come to think of it...It's these years we are in the best shape of our lives.This post was originally published at TheMomCafe.com  where you can find more inspirational words written by Christine Carter.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"

Author of Doorways...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dear-america-dont-get-sic_b_8095440.html,"I'm sitting here at the very bottom of the medical food chain wondering why it's not illegal for pharmaceutical companies to price gauge the products that save our lives. If the price of my daughter's medication wasn't so high, would we have the drugs in hand quicker?",2015-09-06,2015-09-06-1441544485-5401692-20150903_1422131.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-09-06-1441544485-5401692-20150903_1422131-thumb.jpg,"Last week, after two weeks of appealing insurance company denials, I got a call from Fidelis that my daughter's latest oncology drug was approved. I was so effusively grateful to the Fidelis rep, that I'm pretty sure I freaked her out.But she doesn't know the back story. She doesn't know that this is the third oral chemotherapy drug that my daughter will be taking since last June, or that each time we switch to a new drug, we go through the agonizing process of waiting and worrying about getting insurance approval. She doesn't know that with each subsequent scan that shows cancer progression, we are running out of options to treat my daughter's cancer in a minimally invasive way. The targeted drugs that have extended my daughter's life cause few side effects, can be taken orally, and are more effective than the harsher chemotherapy she received a few years ago which didn't work at all. She needs them, obviously. So why is it so hard to get them approved?A 60 Minute piece titled The Cost of Cancer Drugs sheds some light on that question. In this piece, Dr. Leonard Saltz, Chief of Gastroinestinal Oncology at Memorial Sloan Kettering, estimates that the cost of cancer drugs is roughly $100,000 a year. In fact, he made the decision not to include a new drug, Zaltrap, as a treatment option for his patients because it was more than double the price of Avastin, a drug which was equally effective and already on the market. This decision was revealed in an article in The New York Times and, shortly after, Sanofi dropped the price of the new drug by half.Sanofi dropped the price of Zaltrap less than a month after the original NY Times piece was published. Does that imply that the prices for these much needed drugs are essentially arbitrary? I think it does.I'm sitting here at the very bottom of the medical food chain wondering why it's not illegal for pharmaceutical companies to price gauge the products that save our lives. If the price of my daughter's medication wasn't so high, would we have the drugs in hand quicker? There's no one for me to ask because even though I'm technically the healthcare consumer in this scenario, I have no power. The phrase ""high healthcare costs"" can seem like a talking point, particularly when people are referred to as ""healthcare consumers"" which is somewhat dehumanizing. Add to this the argument (mostly by pharmaceutical executives) that we (as consumers) aren't directly impacted by the high cost of drugs because insurance companies get the brunt of it, and we're basically expected to just live with it - live with intractable drug prices, live with insurance companies, drug companies and hospitals calling all the shots on pricing. We have to live with it because what's the alternative? Don't get sick.When my daughter's cancer was progressing last June, her oncologist attempted to get her first targeted oral chemotherapy drug approved from our insurance company. That first drug offered a lot of hope. It was really ground breaking. The technology involved in identifying how this drug could specifically help my daughter was brand new. It literally did not exist two years ago and neither did the drug. But from the time the oncologist decided to try this miracle drug to the moment it arrived at our door, two months passed.Two months that the tumors had time to grow and spread.Two months of constant phone calls, faxing paperwork, and staying up late at night wondering if it would be approved, if it would ever arrive.Ultimately it was approved and it even worked -- until it didn't anymore, which is the sad story of many cancer drugs. My daughter was switched to another oral chemotherapy drug around December. It took about three weeks to get the drug (three more weeks of waiting, worrying and wondering if the cancer was growing). The pharmacy refused to ship more than 15 pills which apparently was standard practice because they are that expensive and they don't want any to go to waste (the oncologist was still trying to figure out the dose). The new drug kept her somewhat stable for about six months, but now her cancer is progressing again, so she's in the midst of being switched to a different targeted drug which is manufactured by Pfizer. We started the process of requesting the drug 14 days before we actually received it.Once again I'm left wondering why this is so hard. Is there an executive sitting in a big office at Pfizer who has any idea what it means to have a child with cancer? What kind of insurance does he have? Can he think further than his bottom line? When they set these prices on their miracle drugs, do they consider that if the price is too high, people will die? If I can't afford a therapy, treatment or procedure, it essentially doesn't exist. Not for me. Not for my daughter.And what about the approval process itself? My daughter's drug was denied twice by Fidelis. Each denial costs us more in time. Why do they have the luxury of mulling this over when each day without treatment is a day that could make my daughter sicker? I am glad we got the drug. I truly am. I am glad it exists. But I have never felt smaller or more helpless. That's what ""high healthcare costs"" mean to me. They are real. They are insurmountable, and you know what? I'm tired of being a talking point."

Instead, members see, hear and feel God in nature -- in the soft whispering of the wind in the trees and in the rush of the water under their canoes and kayaks.River Church holds waterside worship services at a pub-turned-chapel on the Nantahala River every Sunday during the summer. A ministry of the nearby Bryson City United Methodist Church, River Church began in 2007 as a way to cater to the needs of the region's outdoor guides and weekend boaters. The open-air setting makes the space more accessible to river rafters who may need to come late or leave early to make it to work on time.""We wanted to have something that felt natural to them,"" said the Rev. Wayne Dickert, the church's pastor and a former Olympic paddler. Sundays during the summer can be a busy time for outdoor enthusiasts in western North Carolina. The region is home to the Nantahala Outdoor Center, which attracts over 1 million visitors every year for whitewater rafting, mountain biking, and paddleboarding. It is also close to the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and the Appalachian Trail.After sermons, Dickert tells attendees to paddle into the river to reflect on that day's message. It's a rare moment of quiet for his members in the middle of a busy summer season. ""They really feel more connected to God outside in creation, in the living, breathing environment that God created,"" Dickert said. ""So when we're worshipping, we can look up and hear the sounds of the rivers, see the green of the trees and hear the birds singing.""""It's just really special to be there,"" he added.
