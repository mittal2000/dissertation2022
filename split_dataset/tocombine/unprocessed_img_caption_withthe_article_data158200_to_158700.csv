Novartis was asking to block a generic form of their cancer drug Gleevec from being created and sold by India. I understand both sides of the battle. I'm a writer, so I identify with not wanting someone else to steal my ideas and profit from them. However, I'm also a person living with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Gleevec is the $7,861-a-month chemotherapy medication I am taking.One argument from the drug company, was that their profits would be gauged if another company offered a generic form. They noted that they have an assistance program for those who cannot afford the drug, and that research and development for other drugs would have to be cut if they lost their patent in India. I struggle with this logic for many reasons: 1) If people cannot afford a medication then the drug will not be bought;2) Assistance programs are not absolute;3) If the record profits this company is showing doesn't allow for further research and development, there is a problem within the structure. Gleevec was approved by the FDA in 2001. In 2007, when I started taking the drug the cost was approximately $3,000.00 a month. By 2012 the cost had risen to $7,861 a month. Every new year I fight with my insurance to cover that cost. After a huge medication only deductible is met in January (this year over $4,000), then I am able to receive my drug for a percentage co-pay (approximately $250) each month. I read that the average wage in India is about $16 a day, with most people of the country living on only $1 or $2 a day. People earning those small wages simply cannot afford thousands of dollars for a medication that will save their lives. Therefore, the drug company will not be losing business from these people.The generic form can be created for a fraction of what is being charged here in the United States. One article stated the generic would cost $2,500 a year. This would allow charity groups to do much more to help those in other countries who cannot afford this medication. You might be wondering why American's cannot then also buy the generic from India. Due to our FDA laws, it is illegal for Americans to bring in medications from pharmacies located outside of the U.S.My second concern is regarding medication assistance programs. It's great that these companies have these programs available, but there's a problem. There is no law that says drug companies have to offer drug assistance programs, or maintain drug assistance programs. Gleevec is a medication that currently is meant to be taken every day for the remainder of a person's life. What happens if the drug company discontinues the program? What happens if there are restrictions of income or location that do not allow a person access to the program? What happens if the drug assistance is only for one year? There are too many questions to stake your life on. I have absolutely benefited from drug assistance programs and what I've found is that they are a bridge, not a safety-net. Many of these programs have a limit they are able to use for those who need help, once that limit is reached, there are no more openings to the program. There is usually a set time limit (a few months or a year) for assistance. Often there are income requirements that are very stringent so if a person makes a few dollars more than the maximum, but not enough to afford the medication, they are stuck in a gap. Assistance programs are helpful to some, but not to all. My final point is regarding research and development of new drugs. I understand the process to creating new medications is costly, and those costs need to be recouped with a profit to make the research financially worthwhile. However, it doesn't appear the makers of Gleevec have lost money from this drug. On the contrary, Novartis is financially doing very well. They have to. Like most pharmaceutical companies they are publicly traded on the stock market. Any company beholden to stockholders who expect record profits every year, are stuck in a cycle where enough will never be enough. Research and development of new drugs should not be the focus of cuts based on this ruling. Perhaps the money spent on lobbyists, or seven year legal battles in India, or excessive advertising, could be looked at first. While I am grateful for Novartis in its distribution of the drug saving my life, I do not appreciate the scare tactic of I didn't get my way, so therefore I'm going to take away future hope from others.This company must have long ago paid off research for this drug. They are making record profits from people who are dependent on their product to live, and their United States patent doesn't run out until 2015. As a writer, I would not want my ideas stolen, but I would hope if I was being greedy with my ideas and potentially harming others because of that greed, someone would make me stop and look at what I was doing. My recommendation to Novartis after this loss in India is to not cut research and development of future life saving drugs, but rather invest in them so perhaps their company can have another cash cow like Gleevec in the future."
1,WELLNESS,Air Pollution From Traffic Linked With Childhood Cancer,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/air-pollution-traffic-childhood-cancer_us_5b9d05c7e4b03a1dcc83d06f,"""It would be interesting to determine if there are specific pollutants like benzene or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that",2013-04-09,"LOS ANGELES, CA - FEBRUARY 05: Traffic on the northbound and southbound lanes of the 110 Harbor Freeway starts to stack up during rush hour traffic on February 5, 2013 in Los Angeles, United States. According to a report, traffic congestion was the second-worst in the country in the greater Los Angeles area. An average commuter spent 61 hours delayed in traffic during 2011. The cost of the wasted time and gas is about $1,300 per commuter according to a report. (Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d05c7240000300094e9bd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There is a link between exposure to traffic pollution during pregnancy and risk of childhood cancer, according to a new study presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research. Researchers from the University of California, Los Angeles, found that women who were exposed to high levels of traffic pollution (emissions from cars and trucks) while they were pregnant also had higher risks of their children going on to develop pediatric cancers, including acute lymphoblastic leukemia and retinoblastoma. Because the risk was increased with higher traffic pollution exposure regardless of the mother's pregnancy trimester -- and even going into the child's first year of life -- researchers were not able to tease out if there is a particular trimester where air pollution has the worst effect on cancer risk. ""Much less is known about exposure to pollution and childhood cancer than adult cancers,"" study researcher Julia Heck, assistant researcher in the department of epidemiology at UCLA, said in a statement. ""Our innovation in this study was looking at other more rare types of childhood cancer, such as retinoblastoma, and their possible connection to traffic-related air pollution.""The study included 3,950 children born between 1998 and 2007 who were part of the California Cancer Registry. All children could be linked with a birth certificate for California, and all were diagnosed with cancer for the first time before reaching age 5. Researchers estimated how much traffic pollution the children's mothers were exposed to during their pregnancy and while the child was an infant (the first year of life), judging on traffic volume, emission rates and other factors. They found that the more the traffic pollution exposure increased, the higher the child's risk was of having acute lymphoblastic leukemia, retinoblastoma (with more cases affecting both eyes instead of just one), and germ cell tumors. ""It would be interesting to determine if there are specific pollutants like benzene or polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons that are driving these associations,"" Heck said in a statement. Because the cancers in the study are rare, the researchers said more work is needed to confirm the findings. Also, it's important to note that the study has yet to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, and thus the results should be considered preliminary. But still, this is hardly the first time air pollution has been linked with cancer risk. A 2011 study in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine showed that living in a highly air-polluted area raises your death risk from lung cancer by 20 percent, compared with living in a less-polluted area. And in 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency released data showing that people who live in certain neighborhoods may have a higher risk of cancer because of higher concentrations of toxic chemicals in the air.

Think again! These days, vending machines worldwide are challenging our preconceived notions of what can or cannot be dispensed at the drop of a coin. In Japan, which has the highest number of vending machines per capita in the world, everything from rice to eggs is sold from automatic machines. Sometimes a machine dispenses cultural essentials, like baguettes in France or sausage in Germany. Other times, vending machines are created to meet a specific need, like the machines that distribute baby food or kosher meals in the U.S (Photo Credit: © flickr/Jack Tanner / flickr/ThommyBrowne).Click here to see the Full List of the World's Oddest Vending MachinesSo whatever happened to the straightforward offering of bagged chips and coke? According to the Wall Street Journal, strange vending concepts are developed because the vending machine as a cultural icon has faded in relevance, so selling out-there items like live bait and prescription drugs helps to boost revenue for the industry. That may be true, and a machine that needs to be physically tackled before dispensing beer certainly could be interpreted as a publicity stunt, but more often than not unusual vending machine items have to be understood from a cultural standpoint. A raw milk machine is scarcely considered odd in Europe, where attitudes about milk pasteurization are different from ours in the U.S. The live crab machines in China might be interpreted as animal cruelty to some, but then again, there have been vending machines selling live lobsters in Maine!Click here to see America's Best BrunchesIf one thing is for certain, it's that vending machines will continue to evolve. Just as the automat in the first half of the 20th century responded to a new urban demand for a fast and cheap lunch, today vending machines are adapting to meet 21st-century needs. For example, as we become conscious of the childhood obesity epidemic, there is a push to make vending machines healthier in schools. Maybe then the vending machine that grows its own lettuce isn't such a wild concept, but rather an innovative step toward making fresh, local food more accessible. Vending machine technology is even developing to the point that we can order a hot meal at the push of a button. There's no telling what the future of vending machine fare will look like, but we wouldn't be surprised if today's popular snacks are soon considered to be old-fashioned.To compile our rankings, we decided that while the most important feature of a vending machine was what's actually dispensed, the method of delivery was also pretty important. The top vending machines, however, all have one thing in common: the product they dispense is alive.- Michelle Kiefer, The Daily MealMore from The Daily Meal: Biggest Food Show Flops Priciest Vintage Lunch Boxes Ben & Jerry's Flavor Graveyard 11 Disappearing Menu Items"

4,WELLNESS,China's Public Still Skeptical Of Government's Handling Of Health Outbreaks,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/china-health-outbreaks-handling-public-bird-flu-h7n9_us_5b9d066be4b03a1dcc83d698,"In a sign of the intense public concern surrounding H7N9, people in China are making a record number of online searches for",2013-04-09,"People wear masks to protect themselves from bird flu in the Metro underground system in Shanghai on April 9, 2013. The World Health Organisation said on April 8 there is no evidence China's new H7N9 strain of bird flu is spreading between humans, as the death toll rises and airline and tourism shares slumped. AFP PHOTO/Peter PARKS (Photo credit should read PETER PARKS/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d066b2100005100c55acd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Michael Martina and Kate KellandBEIJING/LONDON, April 9 (Reuters) - China has earned praise from international scientists for its handling of an outbreak of a deadly new bird flu in humans, but a history of public health cover-ups means the Chinese public is harder to win over.Even as global authorities have said the new H7N9 bird flu strain that has killed eight and infected 28 is no cause for panic, memories of past health scandals continue to undermine the government's credibility at home in dealing with outbreaks.Those suspicions have driven anxiety about the human cases in eastern China, and put the government's response under the microscope as much as the bird flu virus itself.""People aren't fundamentally worried about the bird flu, but about cover-ups and the lack of transparency. The mistrust of the government is far more frightening than H7N9,"" wrote one user on China's Twitter-like microblogging site Weibo.Such fears stem from a long list of attempted cover-ups, including that of an epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which emerged in China in 2002 and killed about one in 10 of the 8,000 people it infected worldwide.Suspicions are also tied to an HIV/AIDS scandal in the 1990s, when officials tried to suppress information of thousands of villagers who were infected through blood donation stations.But both of those scandals came before the advent of popular local microblog sites; these now have millions of Internet-savvy users who, despite heavy online censorship, have managed to whip up public awareness over galling health and food-safety issues.The difficulty of keeping a lid on information is one reason China has increased transparency about H7N9, said Jia Xijin, an expert on civil society at Tsinghua University in Beijing.""Concealing the information is impossible,"" Jia said. ""If they keep the information it will only increase criticism.""Still, Chinese Internet users and newspapers question why it took weeks for the government to announce cases of the bird flu strain, especially as two of the victims fell ill in February.Health officials said it took time to identify the virus, which was previously unknown in humans. Senior officials are acutely aware of the mistrust, and on Monday Vice Premier Liu Yandong called for greater transparency surrounding the virus. SEARCHING FOR ANSWERSIn a sign of the intense public concern surrounding H7N9, people in China are making a record number of online searches for ""bird flu"", according to a Google tracking tool. Search volumes are higher now than at any time in the past nine years.The results, calculated on a comparable adjusted basis, take into account growing Internet use in the country. More Chinese people use the Chinese-language search engine Baidu, but the spike in Google searches is still significant.With the Internet at their fingertips, many Chinese are not holding back. Jia, the Tsinghua professor, said the government's tight grip on information made transparency seem unattainable, leading to constant criticism and occasional wild rumours - among them talk of the flu being the result of a U.S. attack.Listening to the public, Chinese authorities have been quick to counter speculation that the H7N9 outbreak is related to more than 16,000 pig carcasses found dumped in rivers around Shanghai. The World Health Organization (WHO) has said some dead pigs from the rivers tested negative for influenza infection.State media reported some Chinese consumers are making their own decisions, leading to a rush on pharmacy sales of isatis, a herb used in traditional Chinese medicine to cure fever. GLOBAL PRAISEWhile sceptics in China have taken to social media to speak their minds, flu scientists and global public health experts are heaping praise on Beijing for its efforts so far.Chinese doctors and officials, they say, appear to have learned in the past decade that seeking to cover up a public health threat is more likely than not to backfire and create more panic and worry than publicising what is known.""Things have improved tremendously,"" said Ab Osterhaus, a flu expert at the Erasmus Medical Centre in the Netherlands.""What's important is that communication with the WHO and the international scientific community is happening.""Michael O'Leary, the WHO's representative in China, confirmed his team was getting at least daily updates from China's National Health and Family Planning Commission and from the country's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention.Within a day or two of the first cases of the new strain being identified and reported in humans, scientists had posted gene sequence data from virus samples on the website of GISAID, the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data, which makes such data available to flu researchers worldwide.That swift publication has allowed flu experts in laboratories across the world to start picking through the DNA sequence data to try to assess H7N9'S potential for developing into a human pandemic.China's official Xinhua news agency said on Tuesday that the H7N9 virus had not triggered an epidemic among poultry. With no evidence of transmission between humans, experts say the H7N9 flu outbreak merits close watching, but so far does not present an immediate pandemic risk.Jeremy Farrar, a leading expert on infectious diseases and director of Oxford University's research unit in Vietnam, told Reuters that China had done ""a fantastic job"" so far: ""In a way, the West could perhaps learn from the way they have truly integrated the public health and clinical response to this.""
