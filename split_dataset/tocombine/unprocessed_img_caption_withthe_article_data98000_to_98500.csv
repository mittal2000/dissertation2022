It is proposed Kiir would remain president while Machar would become vice president.The warring sides also agreed to abide by a ceasefire deal signed in January 2014 but frequently violated.The rebels, however, said many more details need to be ironed out before the deal can be labeled a ""power-sharing"" agreement.After signing the latest agreement, Machar said the two sides would hold more discussions on the functions of the provisional government.Few other details were revealed after frantic late-night talks. Regional diplomats had warned the warring sides that failure to come up with a new deal could see sanctions imposed on them.The conflict in Africa's newest nation and one of its poorest erupted in December 2013 and has rumbled on since then despite several commitments by Kiir and Machar to halt the violence.More than 10,000 people have been killed, about 1.5 million people have been driven from their homes and many in the oil-producing nation of about 11 million people are struggling to find enough food to eat.Seyoum Mesfin, chief mediator of the East African IGAD bloc, said the two leaders had agreed to resume talks on Feb. 20.""(Those talks) would be final and that would lead them into concluding a comprehensive agreement to end the crisis in South Sudan,"" Mesfin told reporters minutes before Kiir and Machar signed the latest peace deal.Several previous peace deals and ceasefires that accompanied the agreements were swiftly broken.The two sides need a transitional government in place by July, when Kiir's presidential term runs out.Rights groups have said both factions have been responsible for ethnic killings and other abuses, driving the nation to the brink of famine. The fighting has largely pitted Kiir's Dinka ethnic group against Machar's Nuer group. (Reporting by Aaron Maasho; Writing by Drazen Jorgic; Editing by Dominic Evans and Eric Walsh)"
6,POLITICS,"Huckabee, Gay People, Finger Food and Logic","Steve Sanders, ContributorConstitutional law professor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/huckabee-gays-finger-food_b_6591142.html,"Twenty-one states have chosen to democratically enact laws forbidding discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, but no state has enacted laws forcing Jewish delis to serve bacon-wrapped shrimp.  Is there is a reason?",2015-02-01,"Mike Huckabee, former governor of Arkansas, speaks during the Iowa Freedom Summit in Des Moines, Iowa, U.S., on Saturday, Jan. 24, 2015. The talent show that is a presidential campaign began in earnest Saturday as more than 1,200 Republican activists, who probably will vote in Iowa's caucuses, packed into a historic Des Moines theater to see and hear from a parade of their party's prospective entries. Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e6b33c000066000dfe13.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Logic and clear thinking are kryptonite to political balderdash. That’s perhaps the main reason why the world of law sometimes seems so far apart from the world of politics.Law and the courts -- a realm where marriage equality has largely prevailed -- at least attempt to take the logical reasoning process seriously, and to demand fact-based, coherent justifications for someone’s position, rather than just made-up fluff.Contrast this with the Sunday network talk shows or CNN, where prominent people are so often allowed to babble nonsense without being challenged, as long as it fits some version of conventional wisdom or just sounds folksy. Take Mike Huckabee’s weekend “some-of-my-best-friends-are-gay” appearance on CNN discussing gay people and marriage equality. Specifically, consider his comment that expecting conservative Christians like him to accept marriage equality “is like asking someone who’s Jewish to start serving bacon-wrapped shrimp in their deli.”Notwithstanding Huckabee’s authority on the subject of unhealthy finger food … no, it’s actually not like that. Here’s where logic comes in.From the context of the interview, it’s not clear 1) whether Huckabee was referring to forcing someone like him as a person to accept gay marriage, or 2) whether he was objecting to laws in some cities and states that prohibit business owners from refusing to serve customers based on their sexual orientation.Let’s start with number one. Obviously no one is forcing Huckabee to “evolve” (his word) against his will. There is civil marriage and religious marriage, and this is all about civil marriage. No one can or will force his church to celebrate gay weddings. (Wouldn’t it be nice if Huckabee returned the favor and stopped trying to get our law to impose his sectarian creeds on everyone else?) As a citizen, preacher, talk show host, or vanity candidate for president, he has a First Amendment right to believe or say whatever he wants about gay marriage, no matter how silly or illogical.Number two requires a bit more unpacking. Now that they have all but lost on marriage equality, the issue of the moment for Republican lawmakers and conservative religious groups is the demand for “religious exemptions” for florists, cake bakers, innkeepers, and anyone else who claims it would burden their religious beliefs to have to sell their services on equal terms to same-sex couples celebrating their weddings. Laws forbidding discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation exist in fewer than half the states, and the list hasn’t been added to since 2009. But as absurd as Huckabee’s comparison is between gay marriage and appetizers, let’s think it through logically.Twenty-one states have chosen to democratically enact laws forbidding discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, but no state has enacted laws forcing Jewish delis to serve bacon-wrapped shrimp. Is there is a reason?Yes. These 21 states recognized that bigotry, hate, and discrimination against gay people were deeply rooted social problems that ought to be addressed. On the other hand, a lack of Jewish delis serving bacon-wrapped shrimp pales in comparison as a social or historical pathology.Let’s dig a little deeper. Why did these states decide that anti-gay prejudice should be addressed through law?Because discrimination based on characteristics that have nothing to do with a person’s character or abilities (other traits widely protected in law are race, ethnicity, gender, and religion) are corrosive to civic equality and democratic citizenship. Again, this is a different problem from Huckabee’s non-sequitur example. No clear-thinking person believes that the menus of Jewish delis have any significant implications for the health of our social fabric. When we tolerate business owners who set themselves up in the public marketplace and then selectively refuse service to certain people (blacks, Jews, gay people, etc.) for no reason other than political, cultural or religious dislike, it makes all of us complicit in a form of social devaluation toward such persons, as law professor Andrew Koppelman has persuasively argued.By the way, maybe one reason gay people have been historically singled out for discrimination in this way is that certain unevolved people went around comparing them to drinkers and people who use profanity.Prejudice that is unjustified by a person’s character or abilities is antithetical to the values of human rights, equality and liberty that suffuse American legal traditions. And so, just as government can legislate against crime or water pollution, it can legislate against acts of injustice and the social pollution of one faction of citizens attempting to denigrate another. Anti-discrimination laws target acts of discrimination in the public marketplace, not the underlying private religious or political beliefs.To be sure, there are respectable libertarian arguments that government should not regulate such market-sector prejudices at all, for any group, as long as government itself does not denigrate its citizens through discrimination (like refusing to give them marriage licenses). But that is not the argument Huckabee seems to be making. I doubt he is willing to renounce laws that forbid discrimination in the marketplace against Christians or Jews. Most likely, Huckabee simply believes that religious people deserve such laws, but gay people don’t.  "

With every passing week, the political world is a blizzard of brash predictions, bold pronouncements, and bad advice. This year, your Speculatroners shall attempt to decode and defang this world with a regular dispatch that we're calling ""This Week In Coulda Shoulda Maybe."" We hope this helps, but as always, we make no guarantees!Hillary Clinton: Any Minute Now ... Or ThenIt's a mystery of the age: When is Hillary Clinton going to announce her candidacy for president? And the answer is: Hillary Clinton exists in a perpetual meta-state between ""always running"" and ""never not running."" Hillary Clinton is the astronaut in the ""Interstellar"" fourth-dimensional book room, forever warning herself about the dangers of embarking on the journey to the White House. But if she never embarks, how will she end up in the Place Between Time And Space, to warn herself? This is an unresolvable conundrum, until it isn't. But here's what we don't not know about her intentions.Jan. 26: It's all happening, according to a deeply reported Politico piece from Mike Allen, who writes, ""Not only is she running, but we have a very good idea of what her campaign will look like"":Hillary Clinton is in the final stages of planning a presidential campaign that will most likely be launched in early April and has made decisions on most top posts, according to numerous Democrats in close contact with the Clintons and their aides.Perhaps the most significant detail in the whole report, however, was this: ""Most of the top slots have been decided, with one notable exception, communications director."" This would prove to be a little prophetic days later, when, in another deeply reported piece from Mike Allen, communications seem to have broken down:Hillary Clinton, expecting no major challenge for the Democratic nomination, is strongly considering delaying the formal launch of her presidential campaign until July, three months later than originally planned, top Democrats tell Politico.That report contained this instant classic of campaign messaging, from ""one adviser"": ""She's better off as a non-candidate. Why not wait?""But later in the same piece, we learn that the real question might be, ""Why not not wait, why not?""One option being considered would be to announce an exploratory committee earlier -- perhaps in April, at the beginning of a new fundraising quarter, in the time frame when insiders originally expected her to launch her campaign.Time, flat circle, et cetera.So what is the 2016 election about this week?The economy! The Los Angeles Daily News: Not yet in the presidential race, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mitt Romney already are previewing the likely focus of the 2016 campaign, a competition over who’s better able to boost paychecks for working Americans.The great wage slowdown! Greg Sargent, The Washington Post: ""Democratic strategists believe the party got shellacked in the last elections in part because Dems failed to persuade voters they had a comprehensive agenda to address stagnating wages and move the country towards broadly shared prosperity. They think addressing this problem is particularly urgent, because the 2016 elections may turn on which party more convincingly offers answers to the deep, long-term structural problems plaguing the economy.""Marriage equality! Ginger Gibson, The International Business Times: ""The Supreme Court could hand Republicans a ruling that takes gay marriage out of the political debate for 2016 and eliminates an issue that has hurt them in general elections. The court announced Friday that it will hear a challenge to bans on same-sex marriage in April and will likely make a ruling in June, months before the 2016 campaigns really get rolling.""What it will actually be about.

That was the question I was asked when, on the anniversary of Roe v. Wade, I posted remarks, via social media, on the importance of honoring this anniversary and all the women who labored and even lost their lives so that future generations of women would be able to make their own decisions about their bodies. On the same day, I posted an article related to an organizing effort centered on Black Lives Matter, and on that same day I received that message.  I direct a Reproductive Justice organization and we do work to ensure that abortions remain legal and safe and that women have the human right to access an abortion when needed regardless of a woman's locality, economic or immigration status. But Reproductive Justice is not just about abortions any more than equal rights for women are not just about the right to vote.  Reproductive Justice is the term created by black women in 1994 to bridge the gap between reproductive rights and other social justice movements. Reproductive Justice, the human right to not have children, to have children, to parent the children one has in healthy environments and the human right to bodily autonomy and to express one's sexuality freely, insists that we see abortion and reproductive health in the larger context of the overall health and wellness of women, our families and our communities.   For example, demanding that that our health insurance pay for birth control pills and abortions means that we must also address the reality that many people still can't afford insurance or don't have access to get to a doctor.  Although this notion of a more integrated approach to our movement work sounds great in theory, there seems to be this belief that the more attention we put on gender, sexuality, reproduction and violence against women, the more distracted we become from the bigger issues that Black people face that seem to focus around safety, protection and equality for our Black men and boys.  I found myself re-reading the question from my inbox over and over again. ""I thought you worked on abortions so how can you also believe Black Lives Matter?""   The truth of the matter is all of life intersects and we do not live single-issue lives. We can feel the pressure and discrimination. We see the violence inflicted upon us on a news loop 24 hours a day. But do we also know that Black women are dying at a rate four times higher than their white counterparts in childbirth? Do we know that Black women still make less than their male counterparts? Do we know that Mississippi is down to one last abortion clinic for the entire state? Do we know that pregnant women in Tennessee are being criminalized for substance abuse issues as opposed to being rehabilitated? Do we know that federal funds cannot be used to assist women in getting an abortion due to the Hyde Amendment?   Black women have always been at the forefront of our movements. It was the organizing efforts of Black women that started the Reproductive Justice movement twenty years ago and Black queer women that started the Black Lives matter movement, yet we still have to constantly reaffirm that black women and girls' lives are equally as important to the lives of Black men and boys.  Black women have always marched on the front lines for justice and we did so sometimes with menstruation pains, we did so having to remember to take our birth control, we did so pregnant or caring for children, we did so dealing with non-consensual touch or harassment and we did so sometimes with the picture of our slain child, or husband or father or brother or sister on our shirt as a memory.  As I look to the future, I envision a world where our reproductive rights aren't seen as a separate issue that fall squarely on our shoulders alone. To separate reproductive health and rights from the fight for Black liberation would only further our opponents ability to use wedge issues as a strategy to divide us and diminish our collective force that we have yet to fully exercise.  I never responded to the person who sent me the message, but hopefully they will read this article and understand that I have to advocate for abortion access and support efforts like Black Lives Matter because my Blackness and my womanhood are inextricably linked, and I choose all of me. I believe our future depends on all of us bringing our full selves to the fight for freedom, and I believe that Reproductive Justice is the framework that will carry us there.This post is part of the ""Black Future Month"" series produced by The Huffington Post and Black Lives Matter for Black History Month. Each day in February, this series will look at one of 28 different cultural and political issues affecting Black lives, from education to criminal-justice reform.

There's a ""foreign tax exemption"" which makes it legal for you to pay zero state tax and very little federal tax (alternatively, consider starting a business in a state with no income taxes). You will, of course, be ""doubly taxed"" for both Medicare and Social Security taxes--just like you would in the US--since you're both the employer and the employee. There's no getting around Medicare and Social Security taxes as an entrepreneur, but why pay more in taxes than necessary?Each year, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has the ability to change the cap on foreign tax exemption, but for the most part it stays pretty steady. In 2014, the cap was $94,500. That's a pretty big chunk to go almost totally federal tax-free. You can of course go above that cap, but at that point you'll start being taxed. The only rule is that you have to be physically in your ""adopted country"" and outside the U.S. 330 days of the year--so basically you'll be moving abroad.Travel Abroad? Try Living Abroad.There are some instances where entrepreneurs can't swing this. Maybe you have family commitments, such as taking care of an aging parent, and are committed to doing it yourself or seeing them regularly. Maybe your partner has a lucrative, fulfilling career that's location-based. However, if you're one of the lucky few who can move overseas, pack that bathing suit and start perusing beach houses. As a bonus, cost of living in many foreign countries is much cheaper than the U.S., and there are increasingly more areas that are ex-pat friendly.   However, it's not all glitter and unicorns when moving (and starting a business) overseas. Banking can be difficult, especially when your clients are back in the U.S., making payments in dollars (and to American financial institutions), or if you otherwise need to keep an American bank account--like to pay for something like student loans. Not all institutions are created equally, but there are a few U.S. accounts that greatly complement ex-pats and businesses overseas. The benefits? Think no foreign transaction fees and earning great flyer miles with certain credit cards.Here are a few to consider:1. Capital One Venture Card Everyone wants something different with credit card perks, but for ex-pats it just makes sense to choose a travel-focused program. This company's ""Venture"" card gives you double miles for travel, including airfare, hotels and rental cars. You can also use the points to get a paper check, ""erase"" travel-related expenses from your card, and their online travel booking site is intuitive and user-friendly.  2. Schwab Investor Checking This is one of the more widely-praised checking accounts. There's no minimum balance, no foreign transaction fees, and you also earn interest. It's one of the best checking accounts for ex-pats, and of course you can set up direct deposit or PayPal from certain clients.  3. Bank Americard Travel Rewards Credit Card Also featuring no annual fee, zero foreign transaction fees, and even coming EMV-enabled, this is another killer credit card for travelers. You get 1.5 points for every dollar, which is less than the Venture Card--but you can use them for cruises, baggage fees, rental cars and luxury vacation packages.4. Venmo Okay, this isn't a credit card or bank account, but it's a fantastic way to send and receive money for free without those pesky PayPal fees. However, it's just for American accounts, but it's still relevant for ex-pats. There's a good chance your clients will be US-based (higher wages) and you want to be able to receive money without being dinged for it.  Moving abroad is a great way to start a business while enjoying no state taxes, minimal federal taxes, and a lower cost of living. Just make sure you abide by tax rules in your adopted country, which vary greatly but are often very generous to ex-pats."
12,BUSINESS,What Top Financial Consultants Think Every Entrepreneur Should Know about Overseas Living,"Andre Bourque, ContributorEditor Emeritus, Technorati & Tech Evangelist Covering High Gr...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-top-financial-consul_b_6590754.html,"There's a ""secret"" just for entrepreneurs that top financial consultants are eager to share: Moving overseas can, in somecases, save you a bundle on your small business.",2015-02-01,2015-02-01-VentureMilesRewardsCreditCardCapitalOne.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-02-01-VentureMilesRewardsCreditCardCapitalOne-thumb.png,"There's a ""secret"" just for entrepreneurs that top financial consultants are eager to share: Moving overseas can, in somecases, save you a bundle on your small business.I wrote about it before, for some entrepreneurs and small business taking advantage of offshore opportunities is a sensible way to diversify investment channels. There's a ""foreign tax exemption"" which makes it legal for you to pay zero state tax and very little federal tax (alternatively, consider starting a business in a state with no income taxes). You will, of course, be ""doubly taxed"" for both Medicare and Social Security taxes--just like you would in the US--since you're both the employer and the employee. There's no getting around Medicare and Social Security taxes as an entrepreneur, but why pay more in taxes than necessary?Each year, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has the ability to change the cap on foreign tax exemption, but for the most part it stays pretty steady. In 2014, the cap was $94,500. That's a pretty big chunk to go almost totally federal tax-free. You can of course go above that cap, but at that point you'll start being taxed. The only rule is that you have to be physically in your ""adopted country"" and outside the U.S. 330 days of the year--so basically you'll be moving abroad.Travel Abroad? Try Living Abroad.There are some instances where entrepreneurs can't swing this. Maybe you have family commitments, such as taking care of an aging parent, and are committed to doing it yourself or seeing them regularly. Maybe your partner has a lucrative, fulfilling career that's location-based. However, if you're one of the lucky few who can move overseas, pack that bathing suit and start perusing beach houses. As a bonus, cost of living in many foreign countries is much cheaper than the U.S., and there are increasingly more areas that are ex-pat friendly.   However, it's not all glitter and unicorns when moving (and starting a business) overseas. Banking can be difficult, especially when your clients are back in the U.S., making payments in dollars (and to American financial institutions), or if you otherwise need to keep an American bank account--like to pay for something like student loans.

Japan said it was 'outraged' after the Islamic State group released a video purportedly showing the beheading of Japanese hostage Kenji Goto. AFP PHOTO / KAZUHIRO NOGI (Photo credit should read KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc144a32400004f0024facd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"She carries the spirit of her son, a soft power presence in peaceful principles and humanistic values that Japan needs now. The mother of Kenji Goto, who painfully appeared before the press a week ago pleading for her son's life, was met with a throng of cameras on Sunday in Tokyo to make a statement about his death. The sea of cameras surrounding Junko Ishido is most often the reserve of either paparazzi staking out Haneda or Narita airport to catch the comings and goings of Lady Gaga and Johnny Depp or the gaggle of stenographers to power who follow around Prime Minister Abe. Weeping mothers are not usually embroiled in international crisis, nor are they typical foreign policy advisers. But now is the time for the Shinzo Abe government to listen to Mrs. Ishido. Less political outrage, more national contemplation. Last week, when her son was still alive, she offered her life for his:I can only pray as a mother for his release. If I could offer my life I would plead that my son be released. It would be a small sacrifice on my part.She expressed surprise that Goto would leave his newborn daughter to try to help rescue the captive Japanese hostage, Haruna Yukawa, who was killed last week. Goto's sense of responsibility for Yukawa ""was just the kind of person he is,"" said his 76-year-old mother. Today she is left with just the memory of her son. Facing Kenji's death, I cannot find a word. I am now only crying in sorrow. However, I believe that the sadness turning to 'hatred of chain' should not happen. I do hope that we are able to keep Kenji's hopes of creating a society without war and preventing children's lives from war and poverty.This is the woman who heard her young boy tell her that all he wanted to do was to help children in the world. Goto did not see himself as a war correspondent. He wanted to lift the most vulnerable people in the world out of poverty and war, to awaken the consciousness of his home country to care about what was happening in far distant lands and how it connected to here at home. His freelance journalism was a tool for global concern and commitment beyond force. Against the backdrop of this weeping mother, Prime Minister Abe vows to avenge the deaths of Yakura and Goto by increasing Japan's support to countries fighting ISIS. I'm inclined at this time to listen more to the mother of Kenji Goto than to the prime minister of Japan. I awoke in Tokyo at dawn, just as news of Goto's hideous murder video went public. Japan, so long in global minds as a place of peace and tranquility, may never be the same. We've all aged a bit more today. We need to take a long, deep, collective breath and pause to reflect on the last two weeks. Mrs. Ishido, accidental foreign policy informant that you are, your instruction for us to take a pause and prevent a chain reaction of hate, is prophetic and healing. You are not alone in your sorrow. Your courageous appearance before the international press is a testament to the efforts your son made to tell the stories of everyday people. Kenji Goto, your son, did not die in vain. He has your voice."

In Egypt, a Turkish-German force crossed the Sinai Peninsula and attempted to seize control of the Suez Canal. The attack would result in the buildup of British forces in Egypt and led to the decision to begin arming Bedouin tribes in the Arabian Peninsula that were revolting against the Ottoman Empire. In addition, the continued stalemate on the western front and Russian requests for Anglo-French assistance to relieve pressure on its troops in the eastern front and the Caucasus had led Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, to propose a plan to seize control of the Dardanelles and attack Constantinople, forcing the Ottoman Empire out of the war. These two decisions would play a pivotal role in the postwar organization of the Middle East and leave a legacy that reverberates to this day.The Campaign in Sinai and PalestineIt was Britain, supported by Empire troops, which took on the Ottoman and German Empires in the Sinai and Palestine campaigns. These campaigns lasted from January 1915 until shortly before the end of the War. Originally part of the Ottoman Empire, Egypt had been occupied by the British since the 1880s. Through Egypt ran the Suez Canal, which was Great Britain's vital lifeline between her Asian Empire and the home country. British Empire forces defended Egypt, and the Royal Navy protected the canal itself.Arab Rebellion in the Arabian Desert 1915In January 1915, attacking out of a sandstorm, a German-Ottoman force of 25,000 Turkish troops invaded Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and attacked the strategically important Suez Canal. They were fought off by entrenched infantry, supported by the heavy guns of the Royal Navy's warships, and had withdrawn eastward. This would be the first of what would be repeated Ottoman attempts to take control of the Sinai. The objective was to seize control of the Suez Canal and deny its use to Great Britain and the Allies while at the same time forcing Great Britain to commit large numbers of troops to the Middle East. Troops deployed in the Middle East would not be available for duty on the Western Front.GallipoliThe campaign in Gallipoli was one of the most infamous operations of World War I. Although the campaign is well known, its genesis and evolution is far less familiar. It resulted in an Ottoman victory, perhaps their most significant of the war. Combined with Ottoman successes in the Mesopotamian campaign during 1915, it underscored the fact that the Ottoman Empire could conduct an effective protracted defense and that, notwithstanding its lack of modern weapons and training, the Ottoman Army still remained a formidable force. Anglo-French Fleet in the Dardanelles, February 1915After Gallipoli, the notion that Turkey could be quickly knocked out of the war was abandoned. The failure was an embarrassing defeat for the Allies. It cut short, temporarily, the career of Winston Churchill, First Lord of the Admiralty, the man who was most closely associated with the plan, while at the same time launched the meteoritic rise of an obscure Turkish commander named Mustafa Kemal. Early in 1915, in response to the ongoing stalemate on the Western Front, Churchill had proposed a military operation to seize the Turkish Straits, the complex of waterways, consisting of the Dardanelles, the Sea of Marmara and the Bosporus, which connected the Mediterranean Sea, via the Aegean, with the Black Sea. The original plan called for combined land and naval forces to launch an attack in order to secure the Ottoman forts guarding the straits and force the passage to Constantinople. Safely anchored in the Golden Horn, Constantinople's historic anchorage, the big guns of the Royal Navy would intimidate the Ottoman government into submission.Control of the straits would open up a southern route to ship supplies to the Russian forces on the Eastern Front. In addition, the Black Sea was Russia's principal export outlet for its annual wheat crop. With the Baltic and the Black Sea now closed off to Russian shipping, the only other available ports were the Arctic ports of Murmansk and Archangel and the Pacific port of Vladivostok at the other end of the 3,000-mile Trans-Siberian railroad. The Arctic ports were not well developed and could not handle any significant amount of shipping. Neither could the single track rail line from Vladivostok.Success at Gallipoli, it was believed, would also result in the defeat of the Ottoman Empire and knock them out of the war. If Germany came to the aid of the Ottomans it would have to reduce its forces on either the Eastern or Western Fronts. If it didn't, and Constantinople was forced to make a separate peace, then the way was open for Allied forces to land in the Eastern Mediterranean and wage war along an enlarged Eastern Front. Sir John Fisher, First Sea Lord, tentatively supported Churchill. Together, they convinced the Minister of War, Lord Kitchener, who reluctantly agreed to the plan, but only if it was limited to just the Royal Navy and did not require the commitment of ground forces. What would become the first phase of the protracted Gallipoli campaign was scheduled for February 1915. It would prove to be the first of a long series of Allied disasters."

In a recent interview with Vulture, Franco opened up about his very different experience shooting the sex scene with Michael Shannon in 2011 film ""The Broken Tower.""It was very different. Michael Shannon is an awesome actor, one of the best actors of our generation, and a good friend of mine who prides himself on being the guy who will do anything, but he was uncomfortable in that scene. I had to take him to dinner before we shot it because he was so uncomfortable ... he was like, 'We've gotta talk about this.' So I went in to New York, and as soon as we sat down, he was like, 'Aw, now I feel stupid that I'm such a wimp. All right, I'll do it, I'll do it.' Once we got to set, we set up the lights and everybody else cleared the room. It was my DP and focus-puller, and that was it. We did one take, and if you look closely at the scene, you'll see that I am pulling his face close to me because he [refused to get close], and we're supposed to be passionately making out. And he's a strong dude! But in the end, it worked … half-assed love scenes are the worst. Straight or gay! So I was just doing my job on ['I Am Michael'].Speaking to HuffPost Live in a recent interview, Franco's ""I Am Michael"" co-star Carver opened up about shooting the aforementioned scene with Franco and Quinto. ""I think a scene like that you have to have a sense of humor, you just go for it,"" he said. ""There are plenty of things that are more awkward to shoot than a love scene or a sex scene.""""I Am Michael"" follows the story of Michael Glatze, a gay rights activist who turned to Christianity and later renounced his homosexuality.

Robert Morris, R-Fort Wayne, said it was created to give Indiana's Amish population — which is the third largest in the country behind Ohio and Pennsylvania — more access to outside businesses like banks and pharmacies that require a state-issued ID.Other states have passed similar legislation, including Pennsylvania, Arkansas, Missouri and Illinois, although many laws indicate that the department of motor vehicles has discretion on whether or not to issue the IDs.Supporters of the bill said the current photo requirement conflicts with the Biblical prohibition against the making of ""graven images."" The bill would allow those with religious objections to instead have a digital image using facial recognition technology kept on file at the BMV.Some Roads and Transportation Committee members expressed concerns it would increase the use of false or fake IDs and businesses would have no way of determining the ID's authenticity.Committee chairman Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso, said businesses would still have the same discretion they have now when deciding whether to accept an ID. Soliday also said he doubts the exemption will attract other applicants besides those with strict religious beliefs because it's so restrictive.The photo-less ID would list the same details as a real ID, including height, weight, gender, birth date, address and a unique number. However, those with this kind of ID cannot fly commercially, enter a federal building, legally drive or vote.""If you choose this over a driver's license, you are choosing a very restrictive lifestyle,"" Soliday said.The bill will now go to the House floor."

John Conyers (D-Mich.) has pledged to introduce legislation on police accountability following the dismissal of charges against a Detroit police officer who fatally shot a 7-year-old girl. On Friday, the case was dropped against Officer Joseph Weekley in the 2010 death of Aiyana Stanley-Jones, who was killed during a botched police raid while she was sleeping in the couch. Conyers released a statement Saturday saying the decision was unlikely to end the controversy over the incident.“However, our community must not lose sight of the greatest tragedy of all in this situation -- the loss of a 7-year-old innocent child, Aiyana Stanley-Jones,” the congressman said. “I extend my deepest condolences to the family of Aiyana Stanley-Jones during this very difficult time.”Conyers went on to add that the tragedy should lead toward “cultivating community-focused, smart policing,"" starting with basic reforms like police retraining and minimizing use of deadly force.“The troubling circumstances of this case further exemplify the urgency of enacting legislative reforms to address the legal hurdles often faced in creating a system for better police accountability and illustrate the need for major reform in our criminal justice system,” he said. “I plan to take two steps. First, I plan to review the matter very closely. Second, I plan to continue my work on police accountability and follow through by introducing legislation.”  Weekley was first through the door shortly after midnight during the 2010 raid in search of a murder suspect, and shot Aiyana shortly after a flash-bang grenade was thrown. A television crew was filming the incident for a reality show about murder investigations, raising questions about police procedure for the raid. The circumstances of the shooting were disputed at two trials -- Weekley maintained Aiyana’s grandmother had touched his gun, which she denied -- that both ended in a mistrial. At the second trial in October, the judge granted a motion to dismiss the involuntary manslaughter charge, leaving just the charge of careless discharge of a firearm causing death or injury, a misdemeanor that carries a 2-year maximum sentence. Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy said Wednesday they would not seek a third trial for Weekley and called the judge’s decision to drop the manslaughter charge “unfortunate.”In December, Conyers and two other congressmen sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder inquiring about the role the Department of Justice plays in the monitoring and training of SWAT teams and local police forces’ use of military-style equipment.

This is warranted. There is a real problem on college and university campuses, and it is a problem that must be taken seriously. Rape and other forms of sexual violence and sexual assault are intolerable whenever and wherever they occur. Some people say that, because such actions are crimes, colleges and universities should not attempt to adjudicate the issues, but should simply turn these cases over to the criminal justice system. I do not agree. Colleges and universities have an independent responsibility to keep their students safe and to ensure that they can live and learn in an environment free from sexual violence.But the concern with campus sexual assault has begun to take on the characteristics of a panic in which government officials and school administrators have increasingly lost sight of other fundamental values that must shape the culture of institutions of higher learning.In this post, I will address two issues that have caused me particular concern and about which I want to sound a bit of an alarm. The first concerns issues of substance, the second concerns issues of process.The federal Department of Education has put serious pressure on colleges and universities to take aggressive action to deal more effectively with the issue of campus sexual assault. In principle, this is a sound and important step in the right direction. But the Department of Education has declined to define precisely what it means by sexual assault. Clearly, it includes the crime of rape. But the meaning of sexual assault, at least as used in this context, can be extremely, and dangerously vague.Fundamentally, it is bound up with such concepts as ""consent"" and ""unwanted"" sex. The problem is in defining how those concepts apply in this context. In many instances, especially where alcohol is involved, as it often is, extremely difficult questions arise about the meaning of ""consent"" and ""unwanted."" Is it measured by the subjective state of mind of the ""complainant"" or by the reasonable understanding of the ""accused""? How are the participants, and the institutions, to know whether in any given interaction the accused crossed the line?At the moment, academic institutions are at sea on this question. Some institutions now declare that in any sexual encounter there is a presumption of lack of consent, and thus coercion, unless the complainant affirmatively expressed consent at every step in the interaction. Others hold that sexual assault exists only if the accused disregarded a clearly expressed lack of consent. These definitions, and the many other variations that different institutions now employ, are inconsistent with one another, difficult to apply in practice, and confused still further when both individuals were under the influence of alcohol at the time of the incident.The Department of Education has not clarified what it thinks the appropriate standard should be. It has sent strong signals, however, that colleges and universities must be tough on those who commit ""sexual assault,"" however defined. The result is that academic institutions feel compelled to adopt very broad definitions of sexual assault for fear that if they get it ""wrong"" the Department will find them in violation of federal law and strip them of federal funds -- a penalty that strikes at the very heart of many colleges and universities.To eliminate such overreaction on the part of academic institutions, the Department should set a clear -- and sensible -- standard for what counts as sexual assault. This standard should focus on the reasonable understanding of the accused rather than on the subjective understanding of the complainant. To impose serious discipline on students for committing sexual assault when they could not reasonably have understood in the circumstances that the sexual interaction was unwanted sets a standard of culpability that is both unfair to the accused and demeaning to the complainant. The latter point is worth some elaboration. In these situations, the complainant is almost always (though not always) a woman. In the absence of either a reasonable fear of danger or serious incapacitation from drugs or alcohol, the woman in this situation who does not want the sexual encounter should reasonably be expected to make her feelings known at the time. Women students need to be protected from coercion, but they should not be treated as if they are inherently incapable of expressing their feelings, their wants, and their desires. Women students fought long and hard to be treated by colleges and universities as individuals capable of making responsible decisions for themselves. The days of parietal hours are happily behind us. For the federal government -- or for colleges and universities -- to suggest that women students are incapable of making appropriate decisions or of expressing their minds clearly denies them equal dignity and reinforces all the wrong messages about the integrity, independence, and maturity of women. Colleges and universities should not treat their women students as if they are frail, helpless, and weak. The second issue concerns process. Assume that a female student accuses a male student of sexual assault. She alleges that they had some drinks at a party, they went to his room, they made out naked for a while, he took a condom out of his wallet, she said ""no,"" and he nonetheless entered her. He says that she never said ""no"" or that, if she did, he didn't hear it, and that she acted as if she desired sex. He says that he thought it was consensual. If the male student is found to have engaged in sexual assault, he may be suspended or expelled. If female student in fact said ""no"" and he clearly disregarded her lack of consent, expulsion would surely be appropriate. The critical question, though, is what actually happened at that moment, and in sorting that out the burden of proof is central. By what standard should the fact finder have to decide whether her story or his story is true, before expelling him?According the Department of Education, in all such proceedings ""the evidentiary standard that must be used"" is ""preponderance of the evidence,"" that is, whether it is ""more likely than not"" that he committed a sexual assault. In my judgment, that is the wrong standard. Indeed, many if not most colleges and universities have traditionally applied the ""clear and convincing evidence"" standard in such circumstances. The difference between these two standards is roughly the difference between being 51 percent confident that the student committed the sexual assault before expelling him and being 75 percent confident that the student committed the sexual assault before expelling him.To justify its insistence on the preponderance of the evidence standard, the Department of Education draws an analogy to civil actions in court. In the typical civil law suit for damages, whether the issue is a car accident, a breach of contract, or an assault, the standard is preponderance of the evidence. But this is a bad analogy.For a college or university to expel a student for sexual assault is a matter of grave consequence both for the institution and for the student. Such an expulsion will haunt the students for the rest of his days, especially in the world of the Internet. Indeed, it may well destroy his chosen career prospects. This is especially likely, for example, for law students. Moreover, the procedures used in these disciplinary hearings do not come close to those employed in civil actions, which involve judges, juries, rules of evidence, lawyers, discovery, and a host of other procedural protections designed to enhance the reliability of the proceedings. Even at their best, college and university disciplinary proceedings are a far cry from civil actions in terms of fairness to the accused.Thus, although the Department of Education may well be right that ""proof beyond a reasonable doubt"" is unnecessary in these circumstances because there is no risk of imprisonment or a formal criminal record, it is completely unfair, in my judgment, for a college or university to suspend or expel a student on the ground that he committed a sexual assault if the institution is only 51 percent confident that he did so. The Department of Education should either mandate the ""clear and convincing evidence"" standard in these situations, or it should at least leave the institutions free to choose which of those standards best fits their own sense of due process and justice.One might, of course, object that it is just as bad to ""acquit"" a guilty student as to ""convict"" an innocent one. Indeed, we cannot underestimate the emotional and psychological harm to the complainant if her charges are not acted upon. But this is true even in criminal prosecutions. Our core sense of fairness and justice always errs on the side of not erroneously punishing an innocent person. We do not sacrifice that principle even when the accusation is terrorism, murder, rape, or child molestation. We should not sacrifice that principle here.Of course, colleges and universities can and must take many other steps both to reduce the incidence of sexual assault on campus and to protect and care for those individuals who have been victimized by such behavior. But suspending or expelling innocent students is not an acceptable ""solution."""

We lost contact and now the workers might be taken hostage,"" an engineer from the North Oil Co told Reuters, using a derogatory acronym for Islamic State.Kurdish military sources said Major General Hussein Mansour, who had mobilized a unit from Khanaqin to reinforce the Kurdish forces outside Kirkuk, was killed by a sniper in the fighting. The mayor of Khanaqin confirmed the report.IS seized at least four small oilfields when it overran large areas of northern Iraq last summer, and began selling crude oil and gasoline to finance their operations.Khabbaz is a small oilfield 20 km (12 miles) southwest of Kirkuk with a maximum production capacity of 15,000 barrels per day. It was producing around 10,000 bpd before the attack.Islamic State insurgents attacked regional Kurdish forces southwest of Kirkuk on Friday, seizing some areas including parts of the Khabbaz oilfields.Further south near Baghdad, two bombs in a central neighborhood and a farming district south of the capital killed at least seven civilians on Saturday, medics and police said.Two soldiers were also killed when a bomb exploded close to an army patrol near Taji, a predominantly Sunni Muslim rural district north of Baghdad.At least 24 others were wounded in the explosions.In Falluja in the western province of Anbar, hospital sources said five people, including two children, were killed during Iraqi army shelling of Islamic State positions. They said at least 44 others were wounded, including 25 IS fighters.It is difficult to confirm reports from hospitals in the area, which is mostly controlled by Islamic State.The radical jihadist group has declared a medieval-style caliphate in parts of Iraq and Syria and poses the biggest challenge to the stability of OPEC member Iraq since the fall of Saddam Hussein in 2003.
