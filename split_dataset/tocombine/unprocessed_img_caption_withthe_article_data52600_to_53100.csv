We all have to grapple with our place on that spectrum, answer our own consciences, and decide how we want to live our own values.But whether we choose a faith, whatever one we choose, and however we choose to live it, murder and rape and violence and hatred are never a more radical form of faith.

This headline caused worldwide attention to focus on the town of Roswell, New Mexico, beginning nearly 70 years of speculation as to what exactly crashed there.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5773f92e1500002a006c8c9f.jpeg?ops=crop_3_3_797_549%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"In early July 1947 -- the exact date is unknown -- something fell out of the sky, hitting the ground on a ranch 70 miles from Roswell, New Mexico.Was it an extraterrestrial craft? A weather balloon? A top-secret, high-altitude military device used to detect Soviet atomic tests? Nearly 70 years later, those questions persist, with decades of speculation and conjecture fueling the now-legendary case of what's commonly called the Roswell UFO crash. Roswell marks the event each year on the first weekend in July, attracting a variety of speakers and presentations that aim to shed light on what really happened all those years ago.Speakers at this year's two-day Roswell Incident include this reporter, a longtime writer on the UFO beat, with a presentation called, ""Close Encounters of the Military Kind."" The 125-year-old Roswell Daily Record launched the UFO crash legend on July 8, 1947, when it published a startling headline announcing a ""flying saucer"" had been captured, as seen above. The next day, the paper printed a contradictory article, quoting the military as claiming the crashed object was merely a weather balloon.""We have a lot of tie-in with this whole Roswell incident and we wanted to help make it a more serious exploration of the UFO event as kind of a springboard for that topic,"" said the newspaper's publisher, Barbara Beck, whose family has owned the Roswell Daily Record since 1935.""There’s only so much you can talk about the Roswell incident, because most of the people who were associated with it are dead and we really don’t know what happened,"" Beck, pictured below with this reporter, told The Huffington Post.Here's how it unfolded in 1947, as told to this reporter four decades ago, by military participants in the original events:""Col. [William] Blanchard called me and said, 'We've found something northwest of Roswell. We don't know what it is, but you ought to put out a release on it so that we don't get caught with our pants down,'"" said Lt. Walter Haut, who was public information officer of the 509th Bomb Group based at Roswell Army Air Field. (It was the 509th that delivered the atomic bombs on Japan, ending World War II.)Haut said he was never an overly inquisitive person, and didn't talk much about any of this to anyone.""I do not ask a bunch of questions, unless I need the information for a specific thing,"" Haut said. ""I'm not going to go beyond the scope of what I'm working on. I think that the public would appreciate knowing if it's a true fact, that there are intelligent beings outside of our own Earth, and I don't think it would create any panic."" This brings us to Maj. Jesse Marcel, who at the time was in charge of intelligence and security for the base. He was assigned the initial task of going out to the debris field to collect some of the wreckage -- it was scattered over an area about three-quarters of a mile long, and several hundred feet wide.""We went out to the scene of where the crash was and started picking up the debris,"" Marcel recalled. ""It's almost indescribable. It's not the kind of material I'd ever seen in my life, nor have I seen it since.""There were little pieces that looked like they were made of wood, but it wasn't wood, and it had some kind of writing or hieroglyphics that I couldn't decipher and nobody else could. It was flexible, but you couldn't break it and you couldn't burn it.""Also, I found a piece of metal, which was about the thickness of the foil in a pack of cigarettes. But the amazing part about it was you could put it on the ground, hit it with a sledge hammer and you couldn't even put a dent in it! That astounded me, and I knew it was nothing from here. I was convinced it was not from anywhere on Earth, and I'm still convinced of that.""The video below shows Marcel 30 years after the 1947 events of Roswell, sticking to his story.Marcel said that, after gathering the wreckage, he was told by Gen. Roger Ramey at Carswell Air Force Base in Forth Worth, Texas, ""'Don't open your mouth to the press. Put some stuff on the floor and let them take a picture of it.' But I was careful not to put out anything with detail on it. So, they took pictures, and one picture appeared in the papers.""Here is that photo:""Gen. Ramey told news reporters this was nothing but a crashed weather balloon, but I do know this: Later on, I went back to Roswell to resume my duties, but what they did at Carswell was to make a mock display with a battered weather balloon, and they let the press take pictures of that. The whole thing was a cover-up to begin with, and that was the last I heard of it.""There are many more aspects to the original Roswell UFO story, including eyewitnesses to related events. All are overshadowed by the military claim that the crash had nothing to do with an alien ship."

Care partners may think that would be the most tragic situation possible. They consider it the disastrous end of their relationship. When a loved one doesn't recognize his or her caregiver, the caregiver can experience unending, searing pain. Ultimately, however, the situation hurts the caregiver, but may not bother the person living with Alzheimer's. That should be what matters most.Someone with Alzheimer's can still feel a bond with his caregiver even if he doesn't know precisely who that person is. But some caregivers are so upset when their loved ones don't recognize them, they don't see any reason to keep visiting. They figure it doesn't matter. However, there are several reasons why continuing to visit does matter:1. The person may recognize the caregiver but may not be able to express it It's always possible that the person with Alzheimer's does recognize the caregiver but cannot show it in ways that are easy to recognize. I had a personal experience that demonstrates this. Doris was one of the ladies I was assigned to visit at the memory care facility where I volunteer. Doris was so frail and her condition so advanced that the most I could do was hold Doris's hand and speak to her softly. Doris never responded. Then one day as I was holding her hand, Doris put her other hand on my arm and began caressing it. I had the distinct feeling that Doris remembered me. 2. The person may remember how often he is visited even if he no longer remembers his relationship with the caregiver  I was speaking at an Alzheimer's family support group recently. A man there said that he visited his wife, who had advanced-stage Alzheimer's, nearly every day, even though she didn't recognize him. He learned early on, however, that she knew when he'd missed a day. She'd always say, ""You didn't come yesterday."" 3. The person may enjoy being visited, even if he or she doesn't recognize the individual who's visiting I had another personal experience that led me to this conclusion. Ed, my soulmate of 30 years, had many visitors he didn't recognize. When these people were there he'd often hold hands with them--female or male--the whole time. And he'd have long, pleasant talks with them. It was perfectly obvious he was enjoying himself. One should pay attention and see if one's loved one is enjoying the visit. Again, that's what matters.Daniel Potts, MD, FAAN, my co-author for the book Finding Joy in Alzheimer's, is the course director for a college class that pairs students in an art therapy experience with persons who have Alzheimer's disease. The students develop relationships with and empathy for those with the condition. It can be difficult for the students at first, because some of their partners do not remember them from week to week. However, once the students realize that the value of the experience lies in the joy they can offer people in the present moment and the improved quality of life that can result, the experience becomes meaningful to them.4. The caregiver may feel gratified that he's given his loved one pleasureAlthough the main focus of interactions should be the person with Alzheimer's, a caregiver might find there's an unexpected benefit for him or her, too. The person may initially feel hurt or frustrated that his loved one doesn't recognize him, but if that hurdle is surpassed and it's clear that the person with Alzheimer's enjoys the visit, the care partner will probably feel gratified that he is giving his loved one pleasure. Research has found that caregivers might remain in a good mood for some time after the visit. It is difficult for people to accept the fact that their loved ones don't recognize them, and it may take a long time to reach such acceptance. Furthermore, some simply won't be able to achieve this, as hard as they may try, but if they can come to terms with the situation, their lives will most likely improve significantly.5. The person may remain in a good mood long after the visit is overPeople with advanced Alzheimer's may continue to experience the emotional effects of happy or sad experiences for hours after an event has passed. This, in turn, might promote a positive or negative emotional tone, depending on the tone of the visit. For instance, if a person living with Alzheimer's is visited by someone who is cheerful and smiling, who sings familiar songs to them, and who is completely present with them in a compassionate interaction, the positive emotional tone of this visit may last for several hours. Conversely, if the person encounters a caregiver who is gruff, demanding (""Go and get your bath!""), or demeaning (""I'll have to get you a bib because you are spilling your food!"") then the experience may cause a negative emotional reaction. Challenging behaviors may result and make the person more difficult to care for.

Photo: Elena Cué American artist Jeff Koons (York, Pennsylvania, 1955) can be considered one of the most influential artists of his generation. As a representative of the Post-Pop artistic trend, his work also feeds off movements such as Surrealism and Dadaism, as well as classical and Baroque elements as part of an interconnection of time with art history as a whole. He burst into the public arena back in the 1980s in New York, with his own interpretation of Duchamp's ready-mades in the style of Andy Warhol. He then evolved towards an art which blends the objective and more cerebral with the subjective and more sentimental. The work of Koons, full of sensuality and seduction, accurately depicts our post-modern capitalist era, which has made him successfully appealing to the masses. Koons tells us that we cannot comprehend his art if we do not previously let ourselves feel what his work awakens in us: the means to achieve, within the plane of ideas, the rational sense of his art. An optimistic message about overcoming and transcending that which is beyond the sensitive, inviting the spectator to converse with, and hence complete, his work.I step into Jeff Koons' study in Chelsea and am greeted with his brilliant smile, his pleasant tone of voice and a matt white space in stark contrast with his satin sculptures. You grew up in the United States while it was undergoing a cultural transformation at a time when the dream of the American way of life was conceived. How is that reflected in your work?  I was born in 1955 and I was brought up in a middle class family, but a family where we always felt a sense of mobility and a sense of opportunity. I think a lot of it had to do with the history of my grandparents, my parents, my aunts and uncles. A lot of them were merchants. My grandfather was the city treasurer in New York. My father had an interior design business and he had a decorating business, so we were always interacting with people and there was a sense of joy and fulfillment at being involved with a larger community. We felt that we could transform our lives. Our lives continued to get more interesting and there was always a sense that through hard work, you were able to better your life... through education and through experience. Through having strong experiences, you'd be able to continue to, in a way, achieve a transcendence. You became well known in the 1980s, and while your generation was turning mainly to painting as a reaction to earlier conceptual art and minimalism, you instead turned to recycling objects: the readymade vacuum cleaners and balls suspended in water. In comparison to that eruption of expressionist sentiment, your work is like a blast of cold air. Were you trying to distinguish yourself from your generation?I always enjoyed Dada and Surrealism. I went to the Maryland Institute College of Art in Baltimore, and then I transferred to the School of the Art Institute in Chicago. Chicago was very based in personal iconography. So the work made you have sensations, it made you have feelings. Feelings are at the basis of all ideas. First you have feelings, and then through those sensations it develops into ideas. And so I learned a personal iconography, I learned how to affect the way I felt. Then I learned how to affect the way other people felt, and I moved to New York. But I wanted to be involved with more objective art, and not deal so much with my internal life coming out of this tradition of Dada and Surrealism. And so I was drawn to the external world, and I believe that I learned how to trust in myself. Once you trust in yourself, you automatically want to go outside of yourself. I think I ended up working with objects as metaphor for people. And it's not about finding relevance or perfection or imperfection in objects, but it's that you can accept yourself, and then go out and accept others. That's really the highest objective state. And everything is metaphor for that state. Walking out of Plato's cave is this process of self-acceptance, to be able to accept other people. Through that, you are able to remove anxiety and hopefully reach the highest conscious state.  Balloon Dog (Magenta), 1994-2000 mirror-polished stainless steel with transparent color coating 121 x 143 x 45 inches 307.3 x 363.2 x 114.3 cm © Jeff KoonsDoes your art express a nostalgia of childhood, as a kind of paradise without limits or repression?I think back fondly to my childhood. I had the country farm that was my grandfather's. I have really fond memories of being there. I have fond memories of being an artist and coming into the consciousness and enjoying art around four or five years of age. All this time was kind of an exciting period, full of acceptance... being open to the world and enjoying everything. Not shutting down, not rejecting things. There is an openness and an accepting of everything being perfect in its own being and I love that openness. You don't really understand the mechanisms, but there is a certain point when you start to become more deeply involved, when you start to become aware that there are actually disempowering forces at work. There are actually people who want to create rules and certain frameworks to it that are actually empowering them and disempowering others.My art it's a way to get to people, to start to have a dialogue about culture and an embrace of culture, to try and pull them through or around that obstacle. Do you think that highly developed societies are more repressed?One of the things we look to the ancient societies for - we look to ancient Greece, we look to ancient Rome - is actually the openness and not having a repression taking place. We have the eternal in two forms; we have the eternal through life, leapfrogging through biology. So we have the biological realm of the eternal to keep life going forward, and then we have the realm of ideas - of abstraction and Platonism - just ideas, the eternal quality of ideas. And so in great works of art, you have both of these forms of dialogue taking place because they are both wonderful and have their place to enjoy the senses, to be able to reach the highest level of transcendence through the use of the senses. Senses become ideas. Leonardo da Vinci would say that the highest form of art is erotic art, because it affects all of the desires for transcendence, for preservation of the self, for procreation, for being and participating in a sense of oneness... and also the essence of the universe, all at once. When you look at the canon of art history, you look at all the great masters in art history, and they all embraced sensuality. They all embraced the joy of being alive through both body and mind. What does your idea of freedom encompass?To reach one's potential of consciousness. Over the last ten years, Picasso has really been an amazing figure for me. I always enjoyed Picasso's work, but I never felt freedom in his work. I would find freedom in Duchamp and the ideas of what I thought was objective art and then, at a certain point, I started to really look at Picasso and I started to live with Picasso's work and I realized that the objective and the subjective goes full circle. And Picasso's work is layer upon layer upon layer of intuitive thought. It just goes completely full circle into the realm of the universal vocabulary and into archetype, but it is completely objective. For me, Duchamp - well not Duchamp himself, but the type of thought that's been laid on top - became so distant. I felt a complete loss of freedom. And I realized this decades ago, but objects aren't what we're interested in; we're interested in people and that it's all metaphor. So Picasso was dealing much more on a personal level and dealing with the layering. I found a lot of freedom there. So it's the act of becoming better and better. And great artists get better. When I just mentioned that canon of art history, nobody got worse. As an artist, how have you exerted more and more freedom?I mentioned Plato's cave, and I want to reach the highest level of consciousness. I really believe that everything is paralleling us in life right now, and if we could only open ourselves up to the freedom that we have of gesture, we could see that what we really want to do is so accessible to us... it's mind-blowing, the vastness of gesture that we have. But we're kind of here with the blinders on, and I think that anxiety is one of the things that keeps people from doing that. So I would really like to reach a higher state of consciousness to be able to exercise that freedom. I mean I always envision that on your deathbed, all of a sudden, right when you come to your last breath, you may have a consciousness. And I don't want to experience that at death, I want to experience it now.Seated Ballerina, 2010-2015 mirror-polished stainless steel with transparent color coating 83 x 44 3/4 x 77 7/8 inches 210.8 x 113.5 x 197.7 cm © Jeff Koons / Photo: Courtesy Consultatio Real EstateBy displaying the most basic instinct - sex - alongside the most elevated emotion - love - do you turn it into the banal or the sublime?In my Banality series in 1988 that what I was trying to communicate to people is that they are perfect. That everything about their cultural history, everything about their own personal history is perfect. So when I did my Made in Heaven, it had to do with that same dialogue... but it was dealing with self-acceptance in the body. A lot of times, people reject themselves because they can't deal with their own body, they can't deal with their sexuality, they can't deal with themselves. So how to communicate that? I ended up getting involved in extending that dialogue there with the body. I saw Masaccio's expulsion and that type of guilt and shame on Adam and Eve's face, so that's what I was trying to communicate there. And do you stand by that message to this day?What I continue to communicate to this day, or what I try to share, is that throughout history, culture is paralleling our biological body. If you look at our genes it's all inter-connectivity. But outside our body, our cultural life is doing the exact same thing. We do this and we make these connections. I love Manet's work, and Manet loved Goya, and Goya loved Velázquez, and Velázquez loved the sculpture of Ariadne that he brought back by Praxiteles. This type of interconnectivity is paralleling our biological and it changes who we are. Ideas morph our genes. Now, it hasn't been proven by science to show that you can pass that on, but I don't need science to prove that. I myself personally know that I am a different human being from seeing Manet. It's about giving it up to things, it's about finding things outside the self that have relevance and that's connectivity... that's consciousness. And that's one of the key things about my work. Working with objects, these externalized things, are all metaphor for keeping it up. We don't care about objects. We're inanimate. But they help create this dialogue.

Why is there tension between the beauty of classical art and a mundane object?I like gazing balls, and for me they are a symbol of generosity. Growing up and to this day, many people would put them in their garden or put them in their front yard. And it's really an act of generosity for their neighbor... that they will go by and look and have this visual intensity. They were originally created in Venice back in the 1500s, then they fell out of fashion and were repopularized by King Ludwig II of Bavaria. So he repopularized them and in Pennsylvania we have a lot of people of German ancestry, so that's maybe one of the reasons. Then you would go into these larger and larger dialogues about transcendence and then you would have a Farnese Hercules. So I was really having a Nietzschen and Platoism type of dialogue about the two kinds of parallel realms of the eternal. It was about affirmation.

What made this exhibition a step above the rest?  I think that all the exhibitions were absolutely fantastic, but what I enjoyed very much about Bilbao was that there was a complete generosity to the architecture. I think another aspect that made the retrospective in Bilbao so special and so unique from the other ones, was that the public were able to come into the exhibition after passing Puppy. And Puppy had already started a philosophical dialogue about the work. It already gave it a spiritual realm because it's organic; it's these live growing plants... life and death. You have the mortality of the plants, the life cycle versus architecture, because of the organic and inorganic all being mixed together. So philosophically, that already takes the viewer in with a certain state of mind. Each plant is an element of control, a decision, but at the same time, it's about giving up control and walking away and then it's in nature's hands. Certain plants are going to want to move and dominate in one direction, others in a different direction. That's the beauty of it. It's a good metaphor for life...Yes, there are certain areas in life where you need control. You have to. If you don't, you're not able to make your life as productive as possible. But then there are other areas in life, such as relationships with people, where you have to give up control... there's no place for it. What work would you say most represents who you are?There truly isn't one. It's a compilation of all these different experiences. The first time I ever worked with an inflatable rabbit, I put it on two mirrors with an inflatable flower, with another two mirrors on the floor. And it was so intense for me, the visual experience. Hegel would say that the only way something inorganic can procreate is through reflection and I was looking at this. I mean I totally got it, because it was so charged and I had to leave. I had to go and have a beer, because it was just such a strong visual intoxicating experience. It was hard to come down from that intensity of the power of art and of the realization that certain colors and different textures and different kinds of metaphors could be communicated so perfectly. Inflatable Flower and Bunny (Tall White, Pink Bunny), 1979 vinyl, mirrors 32 x 25 x 19 inches 81.3 x 63.5 x 48.3 cm © Jeff KoonsAs a collector, you prefer Classical art. What are your criteria when it comes to buying art?When I was younger, I would make trades sometimes with artists and I've acquired some contemporary art. When you're collecting art, you're able to really absorb and time-travel and feel what it was like to feel the sensations of that person. So I like that type of perception of the metaphysical quality. And art is something that occurs within the viewer, within the individual. A great Giorgione painting is what you feel. The art is a perception of your own possibilities, your own sense of what you can accomplish, how you can expand your parameters in life. That's what is of value. The only thing with value is how your life can be better. I feel in contact with that through dealing with things that aren't contemporary, because there is a timeless quality and I'm curious about archetypes and things that are dealing in the universal. You don't seem to suffer the solitude of the artist; yours seems more like a ""communal"" art.  My work is generated from myself and it comes from a process of following my intuition and through letting things resonate over a period of time. I've had people around me who - because of making paintings or sculptures - I've been able to use to help me realize some of these different works. But at the end of the day, I'm responsible for everything. So the creative process is not communal. I'm in front of it, because it's the gesture. For me, it's that freedom of gesture. So the blank canvas is in front of me at every moment. Every day that I wake up, it's right there. To make the things that I really want to make and to do the things that I really want to do in life, I have to do it. I really think it's totally the same as a painter - whether somebody is thinking about that with a frame in front of them, or how they're exercising their medium of consciousness and medium and practice - but it's still about that gesture. With your symbols of the banal, are you showing us our world, as if to say, this is what we are, this is how things are... deal with it? I believe in communication. That's how I think about the viewer. It's not to get any response from them, other than what I put into it... the excitement, the energy. You know, I make something because I'm in awe and wonder of what that idea is and what that will be like. I'm excited by it. I just want them to feel that. The viewer always finishes it; they bring their own history, they bring other things to it, but I want them to feel a sense of potential and to feel vaster than prior to the experiencing of that work. You went further than other American artists such as Tom Wesselmann or Mel Ramos, who transformed sex into Pop, by making your own exhibitionism into Pop art...One of the things that I've always enjoyed about Pop art is that it is an art style that has quite a cerebral dialogue taking place. And it helps communicate that information. Not in such a dry, cerebral way, but it takes information and it helps continue to reinforce that ideas come through feelings, so that people can feel a little aroused, they can feel excited and communication can come to you through the genitalia or other parts of the body. Because if you present people with dry, cerebral ideas you can lose them. They don't understand how abundant everything is around them. So it's to communicate really the vastness of ideas. The last thing I would want to do is to have a dialogue about the readymade and a discourse of dry, cerebral quality, because that's not life. Life is everything and this is what the Pop artists did, like you mentioned. I really think that the strength of Warhol was that he was able to have a dialogue about life and death taking place, and he'd use the metaphor for the abstraction of what happens in the printing process of silkscreen - how clear something could be and how precise to a definitive, figurative representation - and representing life through something that's pulled more abstractly and doesn't completely come through more deathly. Again, this was a very central approach, of course, for Lichtenstein and all of the Pop artists.  Jeff Koons. Photo: Elena Cué   Spanish version: Entrevista a Jeff Koons "

I had the country farm that was my grandfather's. I have really fond memories of being there. I have fond memories of being an artist and coming into the consciousness and enjoying art around four or five years of age. All this time was kind of an exciting period, full of acceptance... being open to the world and enjoying everything. Not shutting down, not rejecting things. There is an openness and an accepting of everything being perfect in its own being and I love that openness. You don't really understand the mechanisms, but there is a certain point when you start to become more deeply involved, when you start to become aware that there are actually disempowering forces at work. There are actually people who want to create rules and certain frameworks to it that are actually empowering them and disempowering others.My art it's a way to get to people, to start to have a dialogue about culture and an embrace of culture, to try and pull them through or around that obstacle. Do you think that highly developed societies are more repressed?One of the things we look to the ancient societies for - we look to ancient Greece, we look to ancient Rome - is actually the openness and not having a repression taking place. We have the eternal in two forms; we have the eternal through life, leapfrogging through biology. So we have the biological realm of the eternal to keep life going forward, and then we have the realm of ideas - of abstraction and Platonism - just ideas, the eternal quality of ideas. And so in great works of art, you have both of these forms of dialogue taking place because they are both wonderful and have their place to enjoy the senses, to be able to reach the highest level of transcendence through the use of the senses. Senses become ideas. Leonardo da Vinci would say that the highest form of art is erotic art, because it affects all of the desires for transcendence, for preservation of the self, for procreation, for being and participating in a sense of oneness... and also the essence of the universe, all at once. When you look at the canon of art history, you look at all the great masters in art history, and they all embraced sensuality. They all embraced the joy of being alive through both body and mind. What does your idea of freedom encompass?To reach one's potential of consciousness. Over the last ten years, Picasso has really been an amazing figure for me. I always enjoyed Picasso's work, but I never felt freedom in his work. I would find freedom in Duchamp and the ideas of what I thought was objective art and then, at a certain point, I started to really look at Picasso and I started to live with Picasso's work and I realized that the objective and the subjective goes full circle. And Picasso's work is layer upon layer upon layer of intuitive thought. It just goes completely full circle into the realm of the universal vocabulary and into archetype, but it is completely objective. For me, Duchamp - well not Duchamp himself, but the type of thought that's been laid on top - became so distant. I felt a complete loss of freedom. And I realized this decades ago, but objects aren't what we're interested in; we're interested in people and that it's all metaphor. So Picasso was dealing much more on a personal level and dealing with the layering. I found a lot of freedom there. So it's the act of becoming better and better. And great artists get better. When I just mentioned that canon of art history, nobody got worse. As an artist, how have you exerted more and more freedom?I mentioned Plato's cave, and I want to reach the highest level of consciousness. I really believe that everything is paralleling us in life right now, and if we could only open ourselves up to the freedom that we have of gesture, we could see that what we really want to do is so accessible to us... it's mind-blowing, the vastness of gesture that we have. But we're kind of here with the blinders on, and I think that anxiety is one of the things that keeps people from doing that. So I would really like to reach a higher state of consciousness to be able to exercise that freedom. I mean I always envision that on your deathbed, all of a sudden, right when you come to your last breath, you may have a consciousness. And I don't want to experience that at death, I want to experience it now.Seated Ballerina, 2010-2015 mirror-polished stainless steel with transparent color coating 83 x 44 3/4 x 77 7/8 inches 210.8 x 113.5 x 197.7 cm © Jeff Koons / Photo: Courtesy Consultatio Real EstateBy displaying the most basic instinct - sex - alongside the most elevated emotion - love - do you turn it into the banal or the sublime?In my Banality series in 1988 that what I was trying to communicate to people is that they are perfect. That everything about their cultural history, everything about their own personal history is perfect. So when I did my Made in Heaven, it had to do with that same dialogue... but it was dealing with self-acceptance in the body. A lot of times, people reject themselves because they can't deal with their own body, they can't deal with their sexuality, they can't deal with themselves. So how to communicate that? I ended up getting involved in extending that dialogue there with the body. I saw Masaccio's expulsion and that type of guilt and shame on Adam and Eve's face, so that's what I was trying to communicate there. And do you stand by that message to this day?What I continue to communicate to this day, or what I try to share, is that throughout history, culture is paralleling our biological body. If you look at our genes it's all inter-connectivity. But outside our body, our cultural life is doing the exact same thing. We do this and we make these connections. I love Manet's work, and Manet loved Goya, and Goya loved Velázquez, and Velázquez loved the sculpture of Ariadne that he brought back by Praxiteles. This type of interconnectivity is paralleling our biological and it changes who we are. Ideas morph our genes. Now, it hasn't been proven by science to show that you can pass that on, but I don't need science to prove that. I myself personally know that I am a different human being from seeing Manet. It's about giving it up to things, it's about finding things outside the self that have relevance and that's connectivity... that's consciousness. And that's one of the key things about my work. Working with objects, these externalized things, are all metaphor for keeping it up. We don't care about objects. We're inanimate. But they help create this dialogue.

Why is there tension between the beauty of classical art and a mundane object?I like gazing balls, and for me they are a symbol of generosity. Growing up and to this day, many people would put them in their garden or put them in their front yard. And it's really an act of generosity for their neighbor... that they will go by and look and have this visual intensity. They were originally created in Venice back in the 1500s, then they fell out of fashion and were repopularized by King Ludwig II of Bavaria. So he repopularized them and in Pennsylvania we have a lot of people of German ancestry, so that's maybe one of the reasons. Then you would go into these larger and larger dialogues about transcendence and then you would have a Farnese Hercules. So I was really having a Nietzschen and Platoism type of dialogue about the two kinds of parallel realms of the eternal. It was about affirmation.

What made this exhibition a step above the rest?  I think that all the exhibitions were absolutely fantastic, but what I enjoyed very much about Bilbao was that there was a complete generosity to the architecture. I think another aspect that made the retrospective in Bilbao so special and so unique from the other ones, was that the public were able to come into the exhibition after passing Puppy. And Puppy had already started a philosophical dialogue about the work. It already gave it a spiritual realm because it's organic; it's these live growing plants... life and death. You have the mortality of the plants, the life cycle versus architecture, because of the organic and inorganic all being mixed together. So philosophically, that already takes the viewer in with a certain state of mind. Each plant is an element of control, a decision, but at the same time, it's about giving up control and walking away and then it's in nature's hands. Certain plants are going to want to move and dominate in one direction, others in a different direction. That's the beauty of it. It's a good metaphor for life...Yes, there are certain areas in life where you need control. You have to. If you don't, you're not able to make your life as productive as possible. But then there are other areas in life, such as relationships with people, where you have to give up control... there's no place for it. What work would you say most represents who you are?There truly isn't one. It's a compilation of all these different experiences. The first time I ever worked with an inflatable rabbit, I put it on two mirrors with an inflatable flower, with another two mirrors on the floor. And it was so intense for me, the visual experience. Hegel would say that the only way something inorganic can procreate is through reflection and I was looking at this. I mean I totally got it, because it was so charged and I had to leave. I had to go and have a beer, because it was just such a strong visual intoxicating experience. It was hard to come down from that intensity of the power of art and of the realization that certain colors and different textures and different kinds of metaphors could be communicated so perfectly. Inflatable Flower and Bunny (Tall White, Pink Bunny), 1979 vinyl, mirrors 32 x 25 x 19 inches 81.3 x 63.5 x 48.3 cm © Jeff KoonsAs a collector, you prefer Classical art. What are your criteria when it comes to buying art?When I was younger, I would make trades sometimes with artists and I've acquired some contemporary art. When you're collecting art, you're able to really absorb and time-travel and feel what it was like to feel the sensations of that person. So I like that type of perception of the metaphysical quality. And art is something that occurs within the viewer, within the individual. A great Giorgione painting is what you feel. The art is a perception of your own possibilities, your own sense of what you can accomplish, how you can expand your parameters in life. That's what is of value. The only thing with value is how your life can be better. I feel in contact with that through dealing with things that aren't contemporary, because there is a timeless quality and I'm curious about archetypes and things that are dealing in the universal. You don't seem to suffer the solitude of the artist; yours seems more like a ""communal"" art.  My work is generated from myself and it comes from a process of following my intuition and through letting things resonate over a period of time. I've had people around me who - because of making paintings or sculptures - I've been able to use to help me realize some of these different works. But at the end of the day, I'm responsible for everything. So the creative process is not communal. I'm in front of it, because it's the gesture. For me, it's that freedom of gesture. So the blank canvas is in front of me at every moment. Every day that I wake up, it's right there. To make the things that I really want to make and to do the things that I really want to do in life, I have to do it. I really think it's totally the same as a painter - whether somebody is thinking about that with a frame in front of them, or how they're exercising their medium of consciousness and medium and practice - but it's still about that gesture. With your symbols of the banal, are you showing us our world, as if to say, this is what we are, this is how things are... deal with it? I believe in communication. That's how I think about the viewer. It's not to get any response from them, other than what I put into it... the excitement, the energy. You know, I make something because I'm in awe and wonder of what that idea is and what that will be like. I'm excited by it. I just want them to feel that. The viewer always finishes it; they bring their own history, they bring other things to it, but I want them to feel a sense of potential and to feel vaster than prior to the experiencing of that work. You went further than other American artists such as Tom Wesselmann or Mel Ramos, who transformed sex into Pop, by making your own exhibitionism into Pop art...One of the things that I've always enjoyed about Pop art is that it is an art style that has quite a cerebral dialogue taking place. And it helps communicate that information. Not in such a dry, cerebral way, but it takes information and it helps continue to reinforce that ideas come through feelings, so that people can feel a little aroused, they can feel excited and communication can come to you through the genitalia or other parts of the body. Because if you present people with dry, cerebral ideas you can lose them. They don't understand how abundant everything is around them. So it's to communicate really the vastness of ideas. The last thing I would want to do is to have a dialogue about the readymade and a discourse of dry, cerebral quality, because that's not life. Life is everything and this is what the Pop artists did, like you mentioned. I really think that the strength of Warhol was that he was able to have a dialogue about life and death taking place, and he'd use the metaphor for the abstraction of what happens in the printing process of silkscreen - how clear something could be and how precise to a definitive, figurative representation - and representing life through something that's pulled more abstractly and doesn't completely come through more deathly. Again, this was a very central approach, of course, for Lichtenstein and all of the Pop artists.  Jeff Koons. Photo: Elena Cué   Spanish version: Entrevista a Jeff Koons "

Troops from Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand and South Africa had arrived to join the struggle. More than one million Empire and Dominion men had been deployed, and many were now enroute to the Western Front. Another major offensive was about to be launched.The assault that led to the Battle of the Somme had been planned as far back as late 1915. Originally it had been intended as a joint French-British operation. French General Joseph Joffre had wanted the battle to drain the German army of reserves while simultaneously making territorial gains, much as German General Erich von Falkenhayn had viewed the Battle of Verdun. In the end, it was Verdun that led to the Somme offensive being brought forward a month to July 1, 1916.That date is inscribed in the annals of warfare as the bloodiest day in the history of human conflict. The first day of the offensive, launched on an 18-mile front north of the Somme River, between Arras and Albert, accounted for casualties of 58,000 British troops, a third of them killed. Map of the Somme battlefieldThe assault had been preceded, as was the norm, by an artillery bombardment of the German lines that began on June 24, and continued for eight days. Three thousand guns - half British, half French - dealt the heavy blows that were supposed to obliterate the forward German defenses. In theory, this bombardment would enable British troops to saunter across no-man's land meeting little resistance. The infantry attack was to be supported by a creeping barrage of artillery fire, aimed just ahead of the advancing troops and moving forward as the men advanced. Field Marshal Haig ordered General Sir Henry Rawlinson, whose Fourth Army would spearhead the assault, to consolidate after a limited advance, while to the north other forces would attempt a complete breakthrough of the German defenses.Haig, a cavalry man, was convinced that horse-borne forces would be able to deliver the coup de grâce once the German lines had been breached, and open the way to the towns of Cambrai and Douai. The numerical odds were stacked in favor of the attacking British; they had 27 divisions consisting of 750,000 men, while the German defenders had 16 divisions of the 2nd Army on hand.What Haig's planning failed to take into account was that the artillery's shells - more than 12,000 tons of explosives - would prove unequal to the task of destroying the enemy's front line barbed wire or robustly built concrete bunkers. Many shells failed to explode. The German troops, safely dug into the chalk hills, simply took shelter in their bunkers until the bombardment stopped and then emerged unscathed to man their machine guns.The assault on July 1, was announced with the detonation of a 40,000-pound mine. It had been laid, after seven months of tunneling by Royal Engineers, beneath German front lines on Hawthorn Ridge Redoubt. That massive explosion was followed ten minutes later, at 0730 hours, by the detonation of 16 further mines and the first wave of troops going over the top with bayonets fixed. Not surprisingly, given the amount of warning the Germans had been given by the bombardment and the failure of the artillery to break the defenses, those troops met with little success. Canadian artillery battalion during the Battle of the SommeThey met, instead, deadly machine gun and rifle fire that killed them, wounded them or forced them back into their trenches. Many of the soldiers, weighed down by heavy supplies and expecting an easy passage to the German lines, took no more than a few steps before being struck down by the defenders. Further south French forces, whose offensive had been preceded by a much smaller bombardment, were more successful, but even they could do little more than consolidate their small gains rather than exploit them.Nevertheless, despite appalling losses, Haig persisted with his approach, believing as the battle raged on, that the Germans would eventually succumb to exhaustion and that victory was imminent.

The original number of 50 lumbering ""land-ships"" - ""tank"" was purely a cover name that has stuck - had been reduced to 24 by mechanical and other failures. While the tanks had the desired shock effect on German troops, they proved unreliable and difficult to control. Some infantry troops even took friendly fire from the tanks.

It was essential, he reasoned, that the British should continue to occupy the Germans while French forces continued to push back German forces at Verdun. So it went on until, on November 13, Britain launched what would turn out to be its final effort of the Battle of the Somme: the Battle of Ancre. The battle resulted in the capture of the field fortress of Beaumont Hamel.On November 18, hampered by snow, the Somme offensive ground to a halt. It had gained the British and French allies roughly seven miles of ground and cost around 420,000 British and 200,000 French casualties. On the German side, losses were estimated at half a million.If there was one positive aspect of the Somme, it was the British re-evaluation of the usefulness of smaller tactical units of infantry troops.

We think we read it in a comment to a Washington Post article, but we're not certain. In any case, as the stream of Republicans fleeing the Donald Trump candidacy becomes a flood, it does seem the appropriate metaphor to use -- the ships are leaving the sinking rat this time, not the other way 'round. We'll get to all of these amusing developments in the talking points this week, because we're devoting the entire section to the ""Dump Trump"" theme this week.But first, we've got to get through the weekly news wrap-up and our awards. Let's start with our sitting president, whose job approval poll numbers are now solidly above 50 percent for the first time since his second inauguration. Barack Obama went to Canada this week, and while he was there he gave a speech to their legislature. He was wildly cheered as he spoke, in one case even prompting a chant of ""Four more years!"" from the Canuck politicians (who admittedly may be a little fuzzy on the whole Twenty-Second Amendment thing...). Canadian overenthusiasm aside, though, it is now indisputable that America's standing with the world has improved dramatically ever since Barack Obama took office.June is Supreme Court decision month, and there was quite a bit of action, even from an incomplete bench. This is going to be a strong argument to motivate Democrats this fall, because if the Senate keeps stonewalling Obama's pick, the next president's going to get a SCOTUS nomination on her first day in office.Split 4-4 decisions aside (since they'll doubtlessly return to the court once it is full again), there was a lot of good news for women's rights last week. Texas got smacked down for passing laws they swore up and down were ""out of concern for women's health"" but which were really designed to close every abortion clinic possible. The justices saw through all the pious pseudo-concern for women's health and by a 5-3 vote tossed the laws out. This could (if Obama or Clinton get their pick through, eventually) become a 6-3 majority for the pro-choice faction, it's worth noting.While the abortion ruling garnered more headlines, the Supreme Court also quietly scored a victory against the abuse of the concept of ""freedom of religion"" when they refused to take up a case from Washington state. Cases need at least four votes to even be heard by the high court, which means Kennedy sided with the liberals to reject it. Washington passed a law that mandated all licensed pharmacies in the state stock and provide emergency contraceptives (the ""morning-after pill""). Individual pharmacists could still refuse to serve a customer if they had religious objections, but (importantly) every pharmacy always had to have at least one pharmacist present who was willing to dispense the medication. In other words, when religious objection can be dealt with without any added burden to the customer then that's fine; but no customer can be turned away or referred to another pharmacy instead, because that does add a substantial burden to the customer. If you want to be a licensed pharmacy in the public marketplace, then you've got to serve all the public's needs, no matter what you personally believe. One pharmacist sued, and lost at the appellate level. The Supreme Court's refusal to hear the case means the Washington law stands -- another important victory for women's rights.Pharmacies are licensed and regulated by the state, but some of these ""religious freedom"" attempts are a lot broader. So it was also heartening to hear that a federal court has thrown out Mississippi's ""turn away the gays"" law, passed to give legal protection to anyone refusing a marriage license or any other services for ""religious reasons."" The judge tossed the laws out for being in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. Look for this case (or one like it) to eventually make it to the Supreme Court in the next few years, but for now it's good to see judges even in the Deep South doing the right thing.Let's see, what else? The Pentagon is now going to let transgendered troops serve openly and even allow their insurance to cover all their medical needs. Perhaps not as gigantic a step forward as the end of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell,"" but a milestone nonetheless.Hillary Clinton surprised some people last weekend, when she joined the New York City gay pride parade, near our country's newest National Monument, the Stonewall Inn. She walked with the marchers for four blocks, reportedly. Hillary had a pretty good week all around, starting with what one reporter called ""the most excited crowd I've yet seen at a Clinton rally,"" when she appeared onstage with Senator Elizabeth Warren (in matching blue jackets, even!). Warren is now openly campaigning to be Hillary's veep choice, it seems obvious. So far, she's been doing a pretty impressive job, especially seeing how easily she manages to get under Donald Trump's skin. Also on some people's possible list for Hillary's veep is none other than Senator Al Franken, but we already wrote about this earlier this week, for anyone interested. In other veep-related news, Al Gore's daughter Karenna was arrested at a protest over an oil pipeline in Boston. Gore's reaction was (naturally) that he was very proud of his daughter.The other big positive news for Clinton was when Trey Gowdy had to sheepishly admit that while he had compiled an 800-page report after wasting $7 million on his investigation, that all he had to offer up on Benghazi was a big fat nothingburger. After the ninth full investigation, there was simply no new facts to uncover. No smoking guns, no scandals, no conspiracy theories confirmed. Nada. Zip. The big goose egg. Shinola.Of course, that was before Clinton's husband hopped on Loretta Lynch's plane (which we'll get to in a moment), but in a week that will end in literal fireworks the last (one hopes) Benghazi investigation of all time turned out to be nothing but a dud. Republican conspiracy theorists weren't happy at this fizzle, but then they never seem to be happy about much of anything, so that's not really news.Bernie Sanders is actually making a goodly amount of progress in getting his planks into the Democratic Party platform document. This is good news for all concerned, since his planks are important ones to progressives, and since he's making good on his pledge to fight for his issues. Maybe the Democrats can achieve unity by the time their convention starts, who knows?News from the Trump campaign this week included the teaser that Chris Christie is being vetted as a possible veep candidate. Maybe all that standing-around-like-a-zombie-hostage stuff is going to pay off for Christie! Hey, maybe he'll even swing New Jersey, as Garden State voters flock to an opportunity to get him out of their governor's office....Trump gave another one of those ""Hey everyone, look at me, I'm using the TelePrompTer and staying on script!"" speeches this week, where he outlined his views on trade. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce immediately reacted in horror to the direction Trump is leading the GOP in, because Trump's anti-NAFTA, anti-T.P.P., anti-free-trade positions truly frighten them. We'll have much more on the subject of conservatives and Republicans fleeing the Trump trainwreck later in the program, however.One cheerful sign from the Senate campaign trail is that Republicans might just have already given up on two of their incumbent senators. In one of those noticeable-in-its-absence stories, it seems very little money has been earmarked for advertising in Wisconsin (for Ron Johnson) and zero money in Illinois (for Senator Mark Kirk), by both the party and by a super PAC formed to focus on Republican Senate races. Or ""winnable Republican Senate races,"" to be more accurate. If the GOP money bails on Illinois and Wisconsin, that is two out of the four seats Democrats will need to regain control of the Senate again, so this could be good news. It is early, though, and more ads could be purchased later (just to keep things in perspective).Recreational marijuana legalization ballot initiatives in California and Arizona are moving forward. California's qualified for the ballot and the signatures were turned in for Arizona's, which means citizens in up to eight states may get the chance to vote this November on permanently ending the War On Weed.And finally, just for fun, Washington (District of Columbia) is considering a name change, should their decades-long push for statehood ever become reality. The new moniker they chose was ""New Columbia,"" but it didn't exactly go over all that well. So the Washington Post is helping out by providing a forum for other suggestions. Part of the problem is that many like the label ""DC"" and they're already puzzled over how their postal addresses would look in the future, since North Carolina already has a lock on ""NC."" This led to suggestions like ""District Commonwealth,"" but that seems to be counterintuitive for a new state. Of course, being the internet, there were some highly amusing entries as well, such as ""Doris (I like the name Doris)"" submitted by (you guessed it), ""Doris."" One canny entry was ""Reagan (it might win over one or two Republicans),"" but our favorite was either ""Waist (It's inside the Beltway)"" or (down in the comments) ""Area 51."" Heh. If you've got a better idea what D.C. should call itself if it ever achieves statehood, head on over and share your suggestion!Republicans in the Senate tried to sneak through a bill that would have let the F.B.I. search everyone's browser history without having to get a warrant before doing so. If you didn't hear about this, you're not alone, because it wasn't exactly a big news story or anything. The frightening part is how close it came to pass -- it essentially failed by one vote to gain the 60-vote threshold to move forward.One Democratic senator bravely fought against it and stood up for the Bill of Rights. Which is why this week's Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week award goes to Senator Ron Wyden from Oregon.The provision was introduced by John McCain and Richard Burr, and apparently snuck under the radar of many senators. As Wyden explains:A conservative came up to me and said, ""Do you think people know that under this [bill], without any court approval the government can get people's browsing history?"" I said, ""I don't think most of the Senate knows that.""Interesting that ""a conservative"" was the one to bring it to Wyden's attention. Perhaps Rand Paul had a word in his ear or something? One can only speculate....Some Democrats voted for this measure who had voted against allowing the N.S.A. to collect bulk metadata from phone records last year. They may not have even been aware exactly what it was they were voting for, which is why Wyden is now pressuring them to rethink their stance, since the issue will likely be brought up again for future votes.For remaining vigilant (with the help of an unnamed conservative, to be fair) against those who would wish to water down the Bill of Rights even further, we have to say that the choice of Senator Ron Wyden for Most Impressive Democrat Of The Week was an easy one to make.[Congratulate Senator Ron Wyden on his Senate contact page, to let him know you appreciate his efforts.]We've got two very obvious winners of this week's Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week award. Bill Clinton and Attorney General Loretta Lynch showed an astounding amount of bad judgment this week, on an airport tarmac.Bill apparently was bored hanging around the airport, and noticed another security detail nearby. When he found out Lynch was also waiting in a plane, he decided he'd do the neighborly thing and drop by for a casual chat. Lynch let him onto her plane and they chatted for 20 or 30 minutes. Then Bill went back to his own plane, and they both took off for their respective destinations.Now, this wouldn't normally be all that big a deal. An ex-president meets with the current A.G., who is from his own party. Nothing but simple courtesy among like-minded politicians.That would be true, of course, if several other things weren't true as well. Bill's wife, of course, is under investigation by the F.B.I. Whenever they get around to finishing their work, they will report to the Justice Department. Lynch runs the Justice Department, and has the final say-so on what happens after the F.B.I. hands in their recommendation. And, to top it all off, Hillary is running for president.These dots aren't all that hard to connect, in fact. The picture they draw is a giant ""STOP"" sign -- as in, ""this is a very bad idea, politically."" The optics are terrible. Even Lynch admitted the next day: ""I certainly wouldn't do it again."" Former president meets with A.G. weeks before she'll have to decide whether or not to indict his wife? In the midst of a presidential campaign? It's a no-brainer, really -- that meeting should not have happened. At the most, Lynch should have appeared at the door of her plane, shaken his hand in full view of everyone, then immediately directed him back down the stairs and turned around to go back inside her plane. Bill Clinton never should have knocked on her plane's door in the first place -- he bears more blame for this idiocy than she does, in fact.Now, we do take Lynch at her word that all they did was chat about their grandkids and other personal trivia. And to her credit, the next day Lynch swore she wasn't even going to be an active part of the process -- she had long intended to just follow whatever recommendation was in the report. This is all to the good, and restores a great deal of her credibility.Even so, she never should have agreed to meet Clinton, and he really should have known better than to even instigate the impromptu meeting. He's a better politician than this, to put it bluntly.For even raising the appearance of impropriety and raising the question of bias over what is already going to be a pivotal moment for Hillary Clinton's campaign, both Bill Clinton and Loretta Lynch have more than earned this week's awards for Most Disappointing Democrat Of The Week. Seems like the Big Dog needs to be on an even-shorter leash out on the campaign trail. Team Hillary should take note.[Contact Attorney General Loretta Lynch on her official contact page, to let her know what you think of her actions. President Bill Clinton is a private citizen, and our policy is not to provide contact information for such.]Volume 398 (7/1/16)Before we begin with our ""Dump Trump"" theme, we have to draw attention to a leaked memo from the Republicans. It's an opposition-research memo on the six top vice-presidential picks Hillary Clinton could make, in essence. It lists possible tactics for attacking each, and suggests talking points to use if they are chosen. It's a preview of what all Republicans will be saying about these choices, should any of them become Clinton's running mate.It's a narrowly-focused professional version (from the other side) of what we attempt to do here each week, which is why we thought it was interesting enough to point out. It also shows that professional talking points are crafted to contradict themselves, in order to appeal to everyone with at least one message they may agree with. When talking about Tim Kaine, for instance, the document makes the argument that he's been ineffective at all his political jobs, and then goes on to suggest:Politically, there will be dual narratives to push: firstly, that Kaine's selection will upset the Sanders wing of the party for not being liberal enough (see above); secondly, that Kaine's selection makes the ticket more liberal than the electorate. Given his career trajectory from ACLU lawyer, Kaine is also a hyperactive partisan, once going so far to as to [sic] call Republicans ""mosquitos.""Got all of that? Kaine has never gotten anything done, but at the same time he's a super-duper-hyper partisan who calls Republicans nasty names and should be feared. Also, he's either not liberal enough or perhaps too liberal -- take your choice. The whole document [PDF] is a fascinating one for anyone with a strong enough stomach to study the mechanics of talking point creation.This week, for us, was a fairly easy one in the talking point creation department. Trump just keeps right on being Trump, and more and more Republicans are realizing that he's never going to change even if they can force him to give the occasional speech from a TelePrompTer. So, once again, it's ""shooting fish in a barrel"" season (a season which might last right up to November, we hasten to add). Enjoy. #SleazyDonaldYou just can't make this stuff up, folks!""I see Donald Trump hired a new communications guy this week. I guess after he fired his campaign manager, he decided it was time to staff up. I've heard he's been having problems getting people to work on his campaign, since some Republican political operatives fear for their own future careers. Even the ones Trump has managed to hire seem to despise him. His new communications guy had to quickly delete a whole bunch of tweets he had written during the primary season with the prominent use of the hashtag '#SleazyDonald.' So I guess Trump's not being too picky about who he'll hire, because at this point he probably can't afford to be."" Half the GOP baseA rather stunning statistic, and one that needs pointing out.""Did you see the new poll that shows that half of Republican voters -- not the general electorate, but just Republicans, mind you -- wish they had a different nominee than Donald Trump? That's pretty jaw-dropping, at this stage of the campaign. We're only weeks away from the Republican National Convention, and over half of their voters would really like to see a different guy on the ballot. Trump also got very low marks on intelligence, honesty, and whether or not he's 'obnoxious.' Once again -- this is how majorities of Republican voters feel about their party's presidential nominee."" Former RNC leader praying for a miracleThis one's a direct quote, because it pretty much speaks for itself. This is from an extraordinary article from Marc Racicot, a former head of the Republican National Committee, explaining why he cannot endorse Donald Trump:[Donald] Trump has demonstrated neither the aforementioned qualities of principled leadership, nor offered any substantive or serious conservative policy proposals consistent with historical Republican Party platform positions. Both, in my humble view, are indispensable preconditions to his selection as the Republican candidate for the office of president of the United States. As a result, I cannot endorse or support Trump for president. And I offer my prayer for a second miracle in Cleveland. The list grows longer every weekWe've spent previous weeks listing prominent GOP stalwarts who have dumped Trump, but now there's a handy reference!""The Washington Post has begun a list -- which they swear they'll be updating regularly -- of all the prominent Republicans who have not only said they won't support Donald Trump as their party's nominee, but have publicly thrown their support to Hillary Clinton instead. This is an astounding development, as I can't recall another time when such respected party stalwarts have not just refused to endorse their own candidate for president, but actually crossed the aisle to support the other party's candidate. This sort of thing just doesn't normally happen, folks. And it's not just one or two -- the Post will be keeping track of the entire list of Republican Party bigwigs (and little-wigs) who are now supporting Clinton over their own party's candidate."" Or you can just leave the party entirely...This wasn't exactly that surprising if you've read anything he's written over the past year on Donald Trump, but still....""Conservative columnist George Will has now not only said he won't support Donald Trump's candidacy, he's actually so disgusted by the prospect that he has publicly left the Republican Party altogether. That's right -- George Will is no longer a registered Republican. Will has always been an establishment Republican, well-ensconced in what passes for the inside-the-Beltway conservative intelligentsia. So his defection is all the more notable, although how influential it might be remains to be seen. Somehow I can't see a whole lot of Trump followers making it through many George Will columns. But you can at least hope that other conservatives with a strong sense of conscience will follow Will as he exits the Republican Party. Trump now leads the GOP, and Trumpism is now Republicanism. If you can't deal with that, then maybe it's time to follow George Will's lead, instead."" The Mexican Air Force?We couldn't resist this one, the best ""Trumpism"" of the week, hands down.""Donald Trump, while campaigning in New Hampshire, was in the midst of his usual anti-Mexico rant when he spotted a plane overhead. His reaction? I quote: 'That could be a Mexican plane up there -- they're getting ready to attack!' Seriously, that's what he said. His paranoia seems to have reached new heights if he thinks the Mexican Air Force had somehow infiltrated not just across the border we share, but deep into New England -- just to personally attack him. And this is the person the Republican Party wants to have his finger on the nuclear button? Really?"" Tramps Against TrumpWe, as usual, saved the best one for last. The only really shocking thing about this is that it was originally a Canadian idea (it was originally ""Sluts Against Harper"") -- we knew they were friendly up there, but this friendly?""A group calling itself 'Tramps Against Trump' is offering up an unusual incentive to vote against Donald Trump. While they aren't specifically for any candidate, if you send their site a selfie with proof that you just voted -- and swear you voted against Donald Trump -- then they'll send you a naked photo. Their spokesperson, who goes by the name Jessica Rabbit, explained: 'In the past we had Rock the Vote and other ways to get the vote out, but what do young people like now? They like naked people on the internet. So, we're using naked people on the internet to make a change and get people excited about something.' Hey, whatever works! She's right about one thing -- naked people on the internet are indeed quite popular, from what I hear (ahem). I'm not sure it's entirely legal, but it certainly is a creative new use of social media in the realm of American politics, that's for sure.""Chris Weigant blogs at:Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigantFull archives of FTP columns: FridayTalkingPoints.comAll-time award winners leaderboard, by rank"

Something to celebrate over this long Fourth of July weekend.",2016-07-02,"President and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights Nancy Northup (R) and President and CEO of Whole Women's Health Amy Hagstrom Miller speak to reporters on the steps of the U.S. Supreme Court after the court took up a major abortion case focusing on whether a Texas law that imposes strict regulations on abortion doctors and clinic buildings interferes with the constitutional right of a woman to end her pregnancy in Washington March 2, 2016. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb81c682100002501c9265c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It is altogether fitting that the Supreme Court's term-end affirmation of women's constitutional right to abortion access in Whole Women's Health v. Hellerstadt came with a very brief but valuable separate concurring opinion by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.In less than two pages, the diminutive but fierce justice, a.k.a. The Notorious RBG, skewered as ""beyond rational belief"" the bogus health justification Texas proffered for the pair of clinic-closing abortion restrictions the Court rejected 5-3, and warned that similar TRAP laws (for Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers) ""that do little or nothing for health, but rather strew impediments to abortion"" cannot pass judicial muster going forward. Beyond providing a useful citation for future cases, and a possible deterrence to red-state politicians contemplating needless new abortion restrictions, Justice Ginsburg's concurrence also had symbolic resonance -- recalling, even without any explicit reference, her own visionary litigation at the ACLU's Women's Rights Project in the 1970s, before joining the bench. In successfully leading the charge to rescue abortion rights in Texas, and even more broadly, from extreme assaults nationwide, the savvy all-out effort helmed by Nancy Northup, head of the Center for Reproductive Rights, was a continuation, too rarely recognized, of Justice Ginsburg's early legacy of fighting for equality. By now, much has been written about the disingenuous and hurtful provisions at issue in Whole Women's Health, and the majority opinion's constructive bolstering of the ""undue burden"" test for assessing the constitutionality of abortion restrictions, insisting that obstacles to abortion access have an actual, overriding health purpose that is rigorously scrutinized by courts for pretext. My limited purpose here is to salute the lawyers whose collective efforts helped bring about this victory.That legal team, for the record, was led by Stephanie Toti, who ably argued the case in March before the justices, standing up impressively to intense questioning from members of the Court -- much of it unfriendly. She had key support from the Center's David Brown and J. Alexander Lawrence of Morrison & Foerster LLP, a private law firm, as well as from junior attorneys and veteran Center advocates like Janet Crepps, who has been engaged in the legal struggle for women's reproductive freedom for more than 30 years. For her pre-Supreme Court work (which did not involve abortion), Justice Ginsburg has been justly celebrated and is thought of by many as the Thurgood Marshall of women's rights. The intrepid Ms. Northup, the strategic architect of the larger campaign around the Whole Women's Health case, and her cadre of dedicated and talented lawyers who handled the litigation day-by-day, should be recognized as part of that same civil rights and constitutional law tradition.Despite sweeping vindication of abortion rights in the dry yet powerful majority opinion written by Justice Stephen Breyer, the favorable outcome was no slam-dunk. The abortion limits at issue had already spread to other states and there were sensitive decisions along the way about which terrible restrictions to challenge and at what stage. The positive trial court findings secured by the Center's lawyers had been rejected by a lower federal appeals court, which castigated the trial judge for daring to hold a four-day trial to independently assess the evidence. There were signals going both ways about where the Court's swing justice, Anthony Kennedy, might land when push-came-to-shove. Without his support, the case could not have been won.Ultimately, Justice Kennedy did the right thing, persuaded to buck his conservative colleagues, it seems, by the overwhelming legal, medical, scientific and other evidence the Center for Reproductive Rights meticulously gathered and put before the Court and the public, unmasking the ""health"" restrictions for the fraud they were, and the physical and dignitary harm to women had they been allowed to take effect.In all, the case is a triumph for honest judging and a freer and more just America. Something to celebrate over this long Fourth of July weekend."

Instead of buying Bonilla out of his $5.9 million contract in 2000, the Mets came up with the brilliant idea to pay him an interest-accruing plan over the span of 25 years. Essentially, the team decided to dish out almost $30 million over an extended period of time instead of paying Bonilla $5.9 million upfront. The craziest part about this deal is that, even though Bonilla has not played a single game since October 2001, he is still the 15th highest paid player on the club's roster. Bonilla is banking more than double what pitching ace Noah Syndergaard is making. Because that makes sense. "

Many Americans argued that it wasn’t right to allow men as young as 18 to be drafted, yet deny them the right to vote. Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1970 and President Richard Nixon signed it, but the law was quickly brought before the Supreme Court. The court ruled that the law applied only to federal elections, not state and local ones. A constitutional amendment would be required to guarantee voting rights across the board for people as young as 18.So Congress passed the 26th Amendment. In accordance with the Constitution, three-fourths of the states, or 38, needed to approve the amendment for it to be ratified. Alabama, Ohio and North Carolina all voted to approve ratification on June 30. When North Carolina's approval process was completed on July 1, 1971, it became the 38th state to approve the amendment, which then officially went into effect, said Christine Blackerby, co-curator of the ""Amending America"" exhibit at the National Archives Museum.Administrator of General Services Robert L. Kunzig certified the official notice of the amendment's ratification on July 5, Blackerby said. Although the president’s signature is not required for a constitutional amendment, some presidents have chosen to sign a document related to an amendment.

Indeed, former Knicks point guard Jeremy Lin, the man whose meteoric rise in 2012 brought a two-month well of joy to NBA fans, has reportedly agreed to re-sign to play within the five boroughs of New York City. (NBA players can't officially sign new contracts until July 7.) He won't play in Manhattan next season, though. No, no, Lin has taken his under-appreciated talents (it's weird how a player can go from overrated to underrated so quickly) to the Brooklyn Nets, reported The Vertical's Adrian Wojnarowski on Friday. Considering he'll be the Nets' second-best player, Brooklyn is now his! We cannot wait to see which Williamsburg apartment he manages to get priced out of. Or what type of facial hair he may try to grow. Or what hobby he'll take up -- the home-brewing, composting and DIY concert scenes would gladly show Lin the ropes of How To Be Cool. And for both sides, it's a really good deal! After a one-year resurgence with the Charlotte Hornets, Lin is coming off his best complete NBA season of his career, and has proven enough to play dependably 25 to 30 minutes a game. Yet he's not the same player who the Knicks, Houston Rockets or Los Angeles Lakers half-heartedly trotted out at times. He's confident and ready to take on a role that let's him ""see how good I can become,"" per ESPN.More glaringly: The Nets don't have a single point guard on their roster right now, so he also fills an obvious need -- one that'll probably help this somehow-worse-than-the-Knicks Nets team win games. The signing is indeed a bitter pill to swallow for some Knicks fans. In such short amount of time, Lin unleashed enough pride and happiness (a foreign feeling in Knicks circles) for a few top Knicks writers to publish a sigh-inducing book titled We'll Always Have Linsanity. Lin's Nets signing, which brings him within a short Uber ride of Madison Square Garden: a reminder of the best time some Knicks fans have ever had rooting for the team; a reminder of a previous Lin-centric Knicks embarrassment; a reminder that the flashier option won't always be the best choice. And for me, an Asian-American Knicks fan who can definitively say that ""Linsanity"" was the best period of my life, an internal conflict brews. He's in New York again, which was totally possible this offseason, but now playing for the wrong team. I say ""wrong team"" from the mouth of a Knicks fan. Yet as one of the few Asian-American role models American culture has pushed into the mainstream consciousness, I see Lin through a unique lens, one that's connected to where my family is from.In simple terms, he looks like me, my brother and my cousins. Lin's ethnicity gives me hope that I'll come across him shopping for wildly cheap produce on Mott Street, or hit-up Mitsuwa across the river in New Jersey. He's back in town, and there are many, many Asian American Lin fans in the tri-state area who will reignite and show up at Nets games for him. Maybe Eddie Huang will show up courtside at the Barclays Center. There's a communal aspect to his draw, and with that, a whole lot people eagerly waiting for him to embrace and explore his culture around the city. There are also selfies to be had.Person to person, we may hold differing values, morals and upbringings, but because of his name, face and family history, I share an ethnic and racial identity with Lin. That can never be erased -- no matter where Lin's NBA career takes him.This time, it's Brooklyn. I can't wait to watch Lin's trip to the Brooklyn Museum on his Snapchat. I can't wait to see his name seen and heard in the streets. I can't wait to see him play 41 times in New York City. It feels good to know the locals again. "

That he won the most Republican primary votes ever. That he beat 16 contenders. But Trump's favorite argument against the campaign to stop him appears to be that it’s “totally illegal.”Sadly for Trump, he’s almost certainly wrong.Because while making that assertion is certainly to his advantage as the “Dump Trump” movement gains traction, a pair of decades-old U.S. Supreme Court cases make clear that a national political party is a private organization with wide latitude as to how it conducts its business.“The delegates can do whatever they want,” laughed a Republican National Committee member who is deeply familiar with the convention rules, but spoke on condition of anonymity to be candid about the party’s internal matters. “This isn’t going to be a legal issue. This is going to be a political issue.”Trump’s campaign did not respond to questions from The Huffington Post, but the candidate himself has made his view on the matter plain. On June 17, Trump said in a statement: “Any such move would not only be totally illegal but also a rebuke of the millions of people who feel so strongly about what I am saying.” On June 19, he told NBC News: “They can’t do it legally.”But the celebrity businessman appears to be relying on state party rules and, in some cases, state laws that require delegates to support the candidate who won their state or congressional district during the primary season. Trump surrogate Scottie Nell Hughes, for example, sent out a tweet last week pointing to a Tennessee statute.But the RNC member said the Supreme Court cases -- one from 1975, the other from 1981 -- dealt precisely with that issue. Delegates may face political retribution from local or state party officials, but given the case law, lawsuits or prosecution are highly unlikely to succeed, he said.And while RNC rules do require convention delegates to vote according to the results of primaries and caucus results in their states, the preamble to the party’s rules states that they are only valid “until the next national convention.”In other words, the rules governing the Cleveland convention haven’t yet been adopted, and they won’t be until the Convention Rules Committee drafts them and the full convention approves them.If the anti-Trump “Free the Delegates” group can muster a majority of the 2,472 delegates, they can clearly get rid of Trump through a rules change, the RNC member said.That nearly all states today even have “bound” delegates is the result of the 2012 primary season. In many of those contests, supporters of former Rep. Ron Paul (R-Texas) swarmed local and state party conventions to win delegate slots to the Tampa convention -- effectively undoing the results of some earlier primaries and caucuses that GOP nominee Mitt Romney won.The RNC responded with new rules, requiring states holding elections open to voters to tie those results to actual bound delegates. Some states responded by avoiding primaries and caucuses altogether, allocating all their delegates through conventions open to party activists, but not necessarily to voters. Colorado was one such state, and is home to the two delegates leading the “Free the Delegates” movement.“Anytime he doesn’t win, that's his response: This is illegal, you've stolen it,” said one of the two, Regina Thomson. “The fact that he calls it illegal just makes me laugh.""Yet as she speaks to other delegates, Thomson said, it's clear that Trump’s statements and litigious history are causing some to worry that crossing him will lead to long, expensive court battles they cannot afford.Anti-Trumpers hope to allay that fear of legal consequences. Steve Lonegan, with the formerly pro-Ted Cruz, now anti-Trump Courageous Conservatives PAC, told delegates on recent conference calls that the group is raising money to pay legal costs for those sued or prosecuted for not voting for Trump.Similarly, anti-Trumpers point to a new federal class-action lawsuit challenging a Virginia state law that, under the threat of criminal penalties, requires both parties to give all their delegates to the winners of their respective primaries. Not even the state parties paid any attention to it: Both Republicans and Democrats allocated their Virginia delegates in proportion to the votes each candidate received.The judge in the case has scheduled a hearing for next week. If the judge finds the Virginia law unconstitutional, anti-Trumpers hope, it will show delegates all over the country that not even state laws, let alone state party rules, can overrule the will of a national party.“With this fresh precedent, delegates will note and understand that Mr. Trump’s protests of illegality are without merit,” said Beau Correll, the Virginia delegate who filed the class-action suit.Yet even if anti-Trumpers persuade delegates that they won’t risk jail time or a lawsuit for changing the rules, they still face the challenge of lining up 57 votes in the Convention Rules Committee and 1,237 among the full delegation.The RNC member said it's possible they could do so -- if Trump’s campaign continues to falter. “I think you’ve got to have a combination of bad poll numbers and bad conduct. Meaning something that shakes up the fundamentals at the convention,” he said.But short of that, he added, the rules that “bind” delegates are probably safe. “The question is: Are there enough votes to do that? I don’t think so. It so goes against the fundamental idea of fairness to change the rules after the fact.”And Sharon Day, co-chair of the RNC, said Trump has nothing to fear. “Donald Trump is our presumptive nominee, and we'll go to the convention and make him our candidate,” she said. “People have voted in primaries and caucuses across the country, and he overwhelmingly won.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Bush, was not mentioned by name in the court's landmark decision in Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, but he laid the groundwork for the high court to ultimately rule that the Texas law was unconstitutional.And if Justice Antonin Scalia were still alive, tradition might have compelled him to give Yeakel a special gift for ruling the way he did, even if the late justice didn't personally agree with the outcome.The Texas law -- which required abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and imposed onerous structural requirements on clinics -- ""creates a brutally effective system of abortion regulation that reduces access to abortion clinics,"" Yeakel wrote in 2014, ""thereby creating a statewide burden for substantial numbers of Texas women."" The Supreme Court, in a 5-3 opinion by Justice Stephen Breyer, gave great weight to this and other findings by Yeakel -- methodically concluding that the law ""provides few, if any, health benefits for women, poses a substantial obstacle to women seeking abortions, and constitutes an undue burden on their constitutional right to do so.""This was a huge vindication for Yeakel, who last year hadn't been so lucky when the conservative U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit largely reversed his earlier decision, which had blocked the contested provisions from going into effect and saved a handful of clinics from having to close their doors. In so many words, the appeals court said that Yeakel got it wrong -- that he ""erred"" in some of his legal conclusions and application of settled law. That meant, in the court's view, that the Texas law could be implemented because it couldn't be shown that it imposed ""an undue burden on a large fraction of women for whom it is relevant."" But that opinion is no more. The Supreme Court earlier this week reversed it.Which brings us back to Scalia and Yeakel. As the justice assigned to oversee the workings of the 5th Circuit -- the judicial region that also includes Louisiana and Mississippi -- Scalia had a tradition for district judges there. It went something like this: If you rule a certain way but then the appeals court reverses you, and later the Supreme Court vindicates your work, you get an award from me at our annual judges' conference.The gift very much reflected Justice Scalia:That would be U.S. District Judge Frank Montalvo, another Bush appointee who sits in the same district as Yeakel. A few years ago he had the good fortune of having the Supreme Court reinstate a decision that the 5th Circuit had shot down.Like Montalvo and another lucky judge a year later, that kind of vindication might have earned Yeakel a duck call whistle from Scalia, an avid hunter who knew a thing or two about duck hunting. He once even wrote a controversial opinion about it.Through a court assistant, Yeakel declined to comment for this article. But it is interesting to imagine him possibly receiving this special memento from Scalia -- who during his nearly 30 years on the bench had staunchly opposed abortion and the jurisprudence the Supreme Court had built to protect it.""Does the deck seem stacked? You bet,"" Scalia complained in a dissent in an abortion-related case. ""The decision in the present case is not an isolated distortion of our traditional constitutional principles, but is merely the latest of many aggressively pro-abortion novelties announced by the court in recent years.""Scalia's absence likely didn't make a difference in the outcome of the Whole Woman's Health decision -- the ruling was 5-3 after all -- but his voice might have resonated had he been around to cast a vote in the case.This post has been updated to note that Yeakel declined to comment for this article."

""That's not a freedom, as actors of color, we feel the right to take because there is so much pressure on every single role that does represent people of color or women that we put a burden on those roles to say something or to represent us or to stand for us.”The star's groundbreaking lead role as Betty Suarez, a Mexican-American journalist, in ABC's ""Ugly Betty"" earned her a Golden Globe in 2007, when she became the first Latina actress to do so. And Ferrera successfully returned to primetime television as the smart and coolheaded big box store floor manager, Amy, in NBC's ""Superstore"" in January. But it was her role as a well-meaning Spanish woman with a stereotypically heavy accent, Brigida, in Netflix's original film ""Special Correspondents"" that prompted ET Online to ask the actress about her thought process when choosing the role. In response, Ferrera said she approached the role of Brigida as a way to dive deep into ""ridiculous stereotypes"" and use the character as a tool to comment on them. But she added that while she understands audiences need to see actors of color and women portraying non-stereotypical roles, as an artist she'd like more creative freedom to choose any character she'd like. “As an audience member, I find myself wanting roles that are female or roles that are women of color to represent a certain thing,"" Ferrera told ET. ""But as an actor, an unequal burden falls upon actors of color to have every role say something and represent something.”For years, Ferrera has been outspoken on the need for more diversity in the entertainment industry. In May, she wrote a guest op-ed on Deadline.com on the topic and also touched upon the pressure she feels when deciding what roles to take on.“Diversity is on everyone’s agenda today, but it’s something I’ve had to think about my entire career, because, in a way, it’s like the tax you pay for being a person of color in this industry,” she wrote in her blog. “You don’t get to avoid these questions. It’d be great to go and audition for roles that don’t have to be representative of every Latino person on the planet, but we aren’t always given that freedom. I can’t just play a housekeeper or a drug dealer, no matter how interesting the character might be, because I always have to think about whether I want to play a role that’s perpetuating the same old stereotypes.”"

Among other things, he argued that an ""M-16 is the quintessential militia-styled arm for the modern day."" In a unanimous ruling issued Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit rejected Hollis’ arguments, categorically noting that ""machine guns are not protected arms under the Second Amendment.""The court explained that the leading Supreme Court precedent on the right to keep and bear arms, 2008’s District of Columbia v. Heller, only protected individual handgun possession for “defense of hearth and home.”""Today ... ordinary military weaponry is far more advanced than the weapons typically found at home and used for (self)-defense,"" the court said, adding that machine guns are ""dangerous and unusual,"" and nothing like what militias might have used at the founding of the republic.""Heller rejected a functionalist interpretation of the Second Amendment premised on the effectiveness of militia service,"" the court of appeals said.Aided by a number of gun rights groups, Hollis had pressed a number of other arguments -- that anything that is ""ordinary military equipment"" is protected, that the Second Amendment really exists to allow a rebellion against the government, and that machine guns aren't really ""dangerous and unusual."" The 5th Circuit was largely unimpressed, calling the last argument ""tantamount to asking us to overrule the Supreme Court."" Interestingly, the court did survey the confused state of gun rights in the wake of the Heller decision, pointing to recent action and inaction by the Supreme Court and lower courts -- on stun guns, so-called ""assault weapons"" and the legal framework for weighing firearm bans -- to suggest that it can only do so much to bring clarity to the law.""We leave changes in Supreme Court caselaw to the Supreme Court,"" the 5th Circuit said.But if the high court's recent moves are any indication, those changes may not come any time soon.Just last week, the Supreme Court declined to review yet another Second Amendment challenge to strict gun control measures enacted in the wake of the elementary school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut -- more evidence that it may not be the right time to determine how far the Second Amendment extends.CLARIFICATION: Language has been updated to indicate that machine guns manufactured prior to 1986 may still be lawfully obtained under federal law."

He has bragged about having good relationships with labor unions. When the AFL-CIO recently endorsed his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, Trump claimed it was he who deserved the labor federation's coveted backing.""I believe [union] members will be voting for me in much larger numbers than for her,"" Trump declared last month.Before entering the voting booth, those union members might want to know how much money one of Trump's businesses has spent in an effort to persuade low-wage workers not to unionize.The Culinary Workers Union recently organized housekeepers and other service workers at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. The union won the election in December -- but not without a fight from hotel owners Trump Ruffin Commercial LLC. That's a joint venture between the likely GOP nominee and casino magnate Phil Ruffin, himself a major financial backer of Trump's presidential run.According to Labor Department disclosure forms reviewed by The Huffington Post, Trump Ruffin shelled out more than half a million dollars last year to a consulting firm that combats union organizing efforts. The money was paid from Trump Ruffin to Cruz & Associates in a series of seven payments between July and December, totaling $560,631.Nearly $285,000 of that money was paid over the course of two weeks in December, shortly after the hotel held its union election.Despite the heavy investment from Trump Ruffin, the union prevailed by a vote of 238 to 209. Trump Ruffin argued in a filing with the National Labor Relations Board that the union illegally swayed the vote, but a regional director for the NLRB rejected those claims. The hotel has asked that the board members in Washington review that decision. According to an NLRB spokeswoman, the board has not yet determined whether it will grant that review.A lawyer for Trump and a campaign spokeswoman did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the payments. Lupe Cruz, the owner of Cruz & Associates, did not respond to a voicemail left at his office on Friday.Cruz, himself a former union organizer, is known for his consulting work on behalf of employers battling unions. Trump Ruffin's disclosure forms listed the payments to Cruz as being for ""consultation services and employee educational meetings.""Companies often enlist the services of anti-union consultants to deal with an organizing campaign. The consultants' goal is to convince enough workers that forming a union would be against their best interests so that the union eventually loses the election. Unions derisively call these consultants ""union busters."" Their tactics can be subtle or not so subtle. When companies retain such firms, they are required to disclose their payments in filings to the Labor Department. While there's nothing out of the ordinary about the Trump hotel's use of labor consultants, the more than half a million dollars spent by the hotel is significant. (For perspective, another Trump enterprise -- his presidential campaign -- began the month of June with only $1.3 million on hand.) The large sum indicates just how badly hotel management wanted to keep workers from unionizing, despite Trump's public claims that he is an ally of rank-and-file workers.The billionaire has spent much of the last week trying to align himself with the downtrodden working class, particularly by speaking out against U.S. trade pacts with other countries. Trump and much of organized labor share the perspective that these have been raw deals for the average American worker.At different points in his campaign, Trump has also boasted that as a business owner, he's gotten along well with unions. ""I've worked with unions over the years -- I've done very well with unions,"" he said at a town hall meeting in February. ""And I have tremendous support within unions.""But the Culinary Workers Union accused management at Trump's hotel of violating labor law numerous times by allegedly retaliating against pro-union employees during the organizing campaign. The NLRB's general counsel, who acts as a kind of prosecutor, found merit in many of those charges, accusing the hotel of illegally firing one worker and intimidating others. The labor board has not yet ruled on the matter.The bargaining unit at Trump International in Las Vegas includes more than 500 housekeepers, restaurant employees and guest services workers, many of them Latino and Filipino. The union has urged the hotel to accept the election results and start bargaining over a first contract. “We asked the company to sit down and bargain with us back in December, and they should have,” Bethany Khan, a union spokeswoman, previously told The Huffington Post. “They’re running out of time and options to delay this.”The union claims that housekeepers at Trump's hotel earn about $3 less per hour than housekeepers at other unionized hotels on the Vegas Strip.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

""There is an overwhelming public interest in the information we requested,"" ACLU SoCal staff attorney Brendan Hamme writes in the letter. ""It is, therefore, deeply troubling that your office refuses to make public the policies and practices that were in place and failed to prevent these constitutional violations from occurring, documents bearing on the scope of the violations, and the policies and practices that your office has pledged to adopt to prevent future violations.""In early March, the ACLU made a records request under the California Public Records Act for information stretching back 30 years, including about policies and procedures related to allegations of prosecutorial misconduct, disclosure of evidence, procurement of interviews with defendants who already had an attorney and use of informants, and policies and practices the DA's office says it has put in place in response to the allegations of misconduct. By the end of the month, Deputy DA Denise Hernandez and Assistant DA Ebrahim Baytieh responded to the ACLU letter. The office provided the ACLU with about 300 pages of materials, some already public, but largely rejected the civil rights organization's substantive requests for records linked to the informant scandal. They argued the request is ""overbroad"" as is, but also said that for some requests, either no records exist at all, they could violate copyright if released, or that they don't exist in a searchable or producible format. The ACLU, in today's letter, is demanding that the office turn over the records it has requested and has offered to engage in a dialogue with the OCDA regarding the request to help sort out any issues with the breadth of the request. But the organization says it will be ""forced to litigate and a court will sort out properly exempted documents from those you are required by law to produce,"" if the OCDA simply further rejects the request.The OCDA says it fully cooperated with the request and provided any and all records in its possession and subject to the state public records act to the ACLU.The OCDA's office has been under fire for almost three years for its involvement in mishandling evidence produced from a secret jailhouse informant program that has allegedly violated the rights of countless defendants. Assistant Public Defender Scott Sanders, who first unearthed the informant network, has been arguing since 2013 that a tainted snitch network in county jails has existed in secret for decades. Sanders argues that county prosecutors and police have violated multiple defendants’ rights by illegally obtaining, and sometimes withholding, evidence gleaned from jail informants.For years the OCDA's office has denied that an informant program existed in the county, but earlier this month they finally acknowledged that an informant program does indeed exist in the county, and sheriff's deputies actively ""cultivated,"" ""recruited"" and ""utilized"" informants and rewarded them in exchange for their information. Additionally, a new trove of secret notes kept by sheriff's deputies about jail inmates and informants surfaced in recent months, shining new light on the informant program.Across the country, law enforcement authorities deploy informants to help bolster a case — a tactic that’s perfectly legal, even when the snitch receives something in exchange. But Sanders alleges that in some Orange County cases, the sheriff’s jailhouse informants held recorded and unrecorded conversations with inmates who were already represented by lawyers — which is a violation of an inmate’s right to counsel. Prosecutors allegedly took damning evidence gathered by the informants and presented it in court, while withholding evidence that could have been beneficial to the defense — which is a violation of a defendant’s right to due process.""Public trust in Orange County’s criminal justice system has been eviscerated by revelations of thirty years of systemic constitutional violations,"" Hamme told The Huffington Post. ""The time has come and gone for the Orange County District Attorney’s Office to adopt transparency and accountability as its guiding principles, but their abysmal and evasive response to our Public Records Act request only raises further questions of exactly what they are hiding from the public."""

Okeyo said that's why she created ""Sisters of Comedy,"" a special stand up showcase that first kicked off in 2014 and features acts from talented black women comedians. The show, which is presented at popular comedy clubs in New York City like Gotham and Carolines on Broadway, is the only all-black women comedy show at any of the top clubs in NYC, Okeyo said. On July 7th, Okeyo will host a special installment of the showcase that will be co-sponsored by Black Lives Matter. The show will be hosted by comedian and writer Chloe Hilliard and will feature comedians Aminah Imani, Sydnee Washington, Janelle James, Sunda Croonquist, and include special guest Judah Friedlander. ""American culture in my view is thirsty for truth and comedy is an excellent vehicle for authentic truths because it's nothing but a voice, ideas and a mic,"" Okeyo said. ""The fact that this particular show is co-sponsored by Black Lives Matter... is a perfect illustration of why I do this work: to celebrate black women, black culture, black self-determination, welcome allies and above all spread laughter with love."" Okeyo said partial proceeds from the show will go to Black Lives Matter on behalf of BLM activist Jasmine Abdullah Richards. Richards, a 28-year-old founder of the Black Lives Matter chapter in Pasadena, California, was convicted of a ""felony lynching"" charge in June. Last September, Pasadena police arrested Richards after they say she interfered with their attempt to arrest a fellow activist at a local peace march. Many activists have spoken out against the charges. Richards was released from jail in July, but Okeyo said the proceeds will help with her existing and future expenses in dealing with this conviction. ""It's critical to raise funds in support of Jasmine Abdullah because she's unfortunately the first black woman ever convicted of lynching in America. That's an astounding charge,"" she said. ""Since the 1980s [California's 'felony lynching' law] has been used as an effective loophole for police to undermine and arrest protesting activists often while they attempt to protect their colleagues from arrest or excessive force."" ""We cannot allow a dubious precedent to legitimize police brutality at this time of social change,"" she added. Through her upcoming showcase, Okeyo said she hopes to amplify the work of the Black Lives Matter movement and the many activists, like Richards, who risk their lives and safety to help defend others. ""I hope this showcase will provide greater awareness about the work of BLM Network, the courage and leadership of Jasmine Abdullah, the power of the Sisters of Comedy showcase (my labor of love) and why our lives so deeply matter,"" she said. ""Most of all, I want people to laugh and celebrate because for me life is a precious gift that must be shared."""

Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) speaks to reporters after waging an almost 15-hour filibuster on the Senate floor to force a vote on gun control on June 15.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57756d011900002400218cfa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- After last month's massacre in Orlando, Democrats in Congress pushed legislation aimed at stopping suspected terrorists from buying guns. Mass shootings by terrorists make up a small percentage of gun deaths in the U.S., however. The majority of gun deaths are actually suicide, which probably comes up less often in the gun debate because people don't fear it. ""The focus largely is on gun murders and mass shootings because those are things you can't control,"" Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) told ""So That Happened,"" the HuffPost Politics podcast. ""It's probably a real false sense of security that people have that they wouldn't be a victim of suicide,"" Murphy continued. ""Most people are talking about the mass shootings, about the gun violence that happens in our cities, because they think that's much more of a threat to them than being involved in a suicide.""According to the most recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 33,636 Americans died from firearm injuries in 2013, and 63 percent of those were suicides.Research suggests that gun availability can be a risk factor for suicide, which is the 10th leading cause of death in the United States. Need help? Call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.Murphy led Senate Democrats in an effort to force votes on gun control in the U.S. Senate last month. The following week, Democrats in the House staged a ""sit-in"" to protest the lack of action in Congress on guns. Neither chamber seems likely to approve gun restrictions anytime soon. Murphy said the Senate is at a ""stuck moment"" on gun control but that June 2016 will be looked back on as a watershed moment. If you — or someone you know — need help, please call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. If you are outside of the U.S., please visit the International Association for Suicide Prevention for a database of international resources.“So, That Happened” is hosted by Jason Linkins, Zach Carter and Arthur Delaney. Joining them this week: Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), historian William Hogeland, and Democratic congressional candidate Zephyr Teachout."

The 26-year-old, who was the Comedy Central show's youngest and first black female correspondent, called out Bernie supporters who say they'll back Trump come election time. Over a video montage of Sanders backers declaring why they can't vote for Clinton, Williams directed her attention to a poll showing that 1/5 of Bernie supporters would vote for Donald Trump over Hillary. Williams interviewed some of these die-hard Sanders voters to attempt to understand why they would vote for someone like the presumptive GOP nominee. ""He is a bigot and a racist, however, Hillary has been a scam artist all her life,"" said one interviewee. ""And I hope the FBI comes and indicts her."" Of course, all of that didn't sit well with Williams. ""I don't get it. How do you go from a left-wing progressive like Bernie to a man who worships money only slightly less than he worships himself?"" she asked. Couldn't have said it better ourselves. Look for Williams when she begins her new, half-hour scripted series on Comedy Central soon. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

Maggie Hassan (D) signed an executive order Thursday that bans discrimination in state government against transgender people.""Throughout our history, it has been clear time and again that we always grow stronger when we work to ensure the full inclusion of all citizens in our democracy, our economy and our communities,"" Hassan said in a statement. ""By making clear that gender identity and gender expression are protected in the State’s anti-discrimination policies, this Executive Order helps ensure that New Hampshire state government welcomes and incorporates the talents and contributions of all of our citizens.""The executive order also requires the state's Justice Department and Department of Administrative Service to review their contracts with the private sector to ensure they include protections against discrimination based on gender identity. The state's Division of Personnel has until Sept. 15 to give guidance to agencies on how to roll out the new policy.State Rep. Ed Butler (D), who is openly gay, hailed Hassan's move.There is currently no federal law that prevents people from being fired or harassed on the job for being lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. A number of states have passed laws barring discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity, and at least 200 cities have passed similar ordinances. But in many states, it's still legal to discriminate against LGBT people, not only in the workplace, but also in terms of access to credit, education, housing, federal financial assistance, jury service and public accommodations.New Hampshire already has a law barring discrimination against lesbian and gay people, but it didn't extend protections to transgender people. Hassan's executive order now covers them.In related news, the Pentagon announced Thursday that it's lifting its ban on transgender people serving in the military. As HuffPost's Amanda Terkel points out, that means transgender service members can now fight and die in wars for their country, but can still get fired from their civilian jobs back home.Hassan is running for U.S. Senate against incumbent Kelly Ayotte (R). HuffPollster shows Ayotte narrowly leading in the polls."

The others were unconscious and he couldn't see out of the window, he added.In reality, he was having hallucinations at home after taking the sedative.""He was very calm during the call, but sounded scared,"" 911 dispatcher Becky McCracken told KOMO News. ""It sounds real. And I've listened to it a couple of times. I would never know it wasn't real.""Authorities dispatched several fire engines to the ""crash"" scene. But the retiree called back to say the realistic-sounding account had not happened and that he'd imagined the whole incident after taking half an Ambien. It's unclear whether the man had mixed the Ambien with any other drugs after his surgery. But a sleep expert said his hallucinations could have been a side effect of regular use.""It must have seemed like he was right in the middle of it, so it must have been almost like a real hallucination for him, and that does speak to some of the potency of Ambien,"" Dr. Gandis Mazeika, from the Sound Sleep Health clinic in Seattle, told ABC News.Ambien ""can cause people to have this kind of disorientation if given inappropriately to a patient or if the dosage is too high,"" Mazeikz said. But if someone wasn't having symptoms taking it, then ""this should not be a warning to stop taking it,"" he added. The Food and Drug Administration lists Ambien, which pharmaceutical company Sanofi produces,  as inducing multiple possible side effects, including abnormal thoughts and behavior, sleep walking, memory loss and anxiety. The Huffington Post has reached out for comment from the manufacturer."
