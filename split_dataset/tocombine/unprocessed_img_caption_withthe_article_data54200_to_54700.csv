A search team on board along with investigators will now draw a map of the wreckage's distribution spots, the committee said in a statement.It was not immediately known which parts of the plane had been found, nor whether the two flight recorders were nearby. The recorders, one for voice and another for data, were contained in the tail of the Airbus A320.Previously collected debris will also be handed over to the investigation committee after ""standard procedures"" are completed by prosecutors who are currently holding it for forensic evidence, the statement added.To recover the black boxes some 3,000 meters (10,000 feet) below the sea surface, investigators will need to pinpoint the signals to within a few meters and establish whether the pingers are still connected to the recorders."

On Wednesday it will say its latest review found ""no conclusive evidence for a carcinogenic effect.""At the same time, however, it will say other scientific evidence suggests that drinking anything very hot -- around 65 degrees Celsius (149 Fahrenheit) or above -- including water, coffee, tea and other beverages, probably does cause cancer of the esophagus.Lyon-based IARC, which last year prompted headlines worldwide by saying processed meat can cause cancer, reached its conclusions after reviewing more than 1,000 scientific studies in humans and animals. There was inadequate evidence for coffee to be classified as either carcinogenic or not carcinogenic.It had previously put coffee as a ""possible carcinogen"" in its 2B category alongside chloroform, lead and many other substances.The U.S. National Coffee Association welcomed the change in IARC's classification as ""great news for coffee drinkers."""

8,THE WORLDPOST,"New Process Seeks To Speed Up Relocation, Family Unification For Refugees Stranded In Greece",Danae Leivada and Sara Elkamel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/greece-refugees-asylum-seekers-relocation_us_5761abcfe4b05e4be8609d90,"Up to 57,000 asylum-seekers are living in limbo.",2016-06-15,"Nearly 57,000 migrants and refugees have been stranded in makeshift camps throughout Greece since Balkan countries closed their borders in March. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5761b41915000030001b99dc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ATHENS, Greece -- The country launched a new pre-registration process for asylum-seekers on June 8th. The beleaguered Mediterranean country has high hopes for the new process, which aims to expedite family reunification requests and relocation efforts for those seeking to settle elsewhere in the EU. As many as 57,000 migrants and refugees from Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan and other conflict-ridden areas who had been attempting to reach western Europe have been stuck in Greece since Balkan countries closed their borders in early March. That decision left many refugees and migrants stranded for months in makeshift camps with little hope and in increasingly harsh living conditions — most notably evidenced by the recently evacuated Idomeni camp.The new pre-registration process, funded by the European Commission and run by the Greek Asylum Service, the UN refugee agency and the European Asylum Support Office, hopes to meet the demand for access to international protection from the tens of thousands of people currently residing in temporary accommodation sites in Greece. In the first three days following the launch of the new registration process, 1,200 people were pre-registered at camps in Athens and the coastal town of Thessaloniki. Speaking to the press at the Elliniko refugee camp in Athens -- where the registration in the capital takes place -- on June 13, director of Greece’s Asylum Service Maria Stavropoulou explained that the goal is to register 1,400 asylum seekers each day, in two sites, over two months. “Each asylum claim is examined on an individual basis,” Katerina Kitidi, of UNHCR Greece, said. “If someone is in need of protection, they can be granted asylum, even if they don’t come from a war-torn country,” she explained.Under the recent EU-Turkey deal, which aims to stem the flow of refugees entering Europe, people currently stranded in Greece are required to apply for asylum to be relocated to other countries in the EU or reunited with their families. They also have the option of requesting asylum in Greece, which may or may not be approved, depending on individual circumstances. The number of claims filed by stranded refugees and migrants have overwhelmed Greek authorities, slowing down the process.The pre-registration operation that Greece just launched is intended to accelerate matters by identifying the nationalities of asylum seekers and discerning the most vulnerable cases before them -- such as unaccompanied minors, people with urgent medical conditions or single-parent families.As soon as asylum seekers complete their pre-registration for asylum, they will receive an asylum seeker’s card that allows them to stay in Greece legally, as well as access basic services, until the country has made a decision on the asylum request, according to UNHCR.Before the new process was instituted, asylum seekers had no legal status while they waited for their asylum applications to be examined.“It's important to give everyone the right to enter the asylum process here, even if some people will not eventually get it,” Kitidi pointed out.While the project kicked off in cities including Athens and Thessaloniki, its implementation has been delayed on the Greek island Chios until June 17, causing anger among the more than 2,000 refugees in the camps there, Al Jazeera reported.In the capital, the process is conducted at the Elliniko camp, located just a few meters away from the buildings which shelter almost 3,500 people.Elliniko, the site of Athens’ former airport and later served as a venue for the 2004 Olympic Games, is a dilapidated complex decried for its squalid conditions by many human rights organizations. Overcrowding in the camp has worsened conditions, leading to mounting tension and breakouts of violence among its inhabitants. The migration minister has said that the evacuation of Elliniko is among the government's top priorities. Stavropoulou thinks the new procedures will help reduce levels of frustration and hopefully ease tensions. “People will get a sense that something is coming in the future, so they will feel like they have options,” she said. The Greek Asylum Service has promised to send a text message by the end of July to people who have pre-registered, informing them of the date and location of their next appointment.

9,TECH,One Thing Snapchat Desperately Needs To Copy From Facebook And Twitter,Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/snapchat-suicide-prevention_us_57601f1de4b053d4330653d9,That little ghost isn't keeping pace.,2016-06-15,Facebook unveiled expanded suicide prevention tools Tuesday -- and Snapchat has some catching up to do.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/576046c92200002e00f80e77.jpeg?cache=C1tVHuZoBL&ops=crop_111_66_1351_935%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Snapchat, despite its popularity with young people, is lagging behind rivals when it comes to suicide prevention tools.Facebook on Tuesday debuted expanded self-harm reporting tools on every version of its service. Anyone who sees a post that signals a friend may be having trouble can now go through a series of steps to report that content as ""suicidal."" The social network will suggest you reach out to the person. And the individual who posted that content will then receive resources from the Facebook team to help them get help. Twitter has similar features.Facebook's move is laudable, given its status as the single largest social network in the world. But recent reports indicate that Facebook has ceded some ground to Snapchat, where users apparently share more ""personal"" stories. But those personal stories come with no clear self-harm reporting tools.If you were to come across an alarming ""Snap"" on that platform, your means of recourse would be pretty limited. The Snapchat app only gives you the options to ""remove friend"" or ""block"" a user outright -- and it's not particularly easy to find these commands in the first place.A representative for the service confirmed to The Huffington Post that there's nothing ""specific"" allowing you to report self-harm.Snapchat does have an online form through which you can ""report a safety or abuse issue."" It's not exactly a breeze: You have to select the type of problem you're reporting, input your email address, username, age, username of the person you want to report, that person's age, the specific type of content you're reporting (""Snap,"" ""Snap Story,"" ""Snapcode Selfie"" and ""Story Explorer"" are your options), when the content was sent and any other relevant information. It also has a dedicated ""Safety Center"" with helpful resources.Given the social network's appeal to young people, there's an argument to be made for a more immediate reporting tool.So why hasn't Snapchat created better reporting tools? One argument: As opposed to Facebook or Twitter, where you're probably connected to hundreds of people you don't often speak to, Snapchat is more intimate -- you use it with your friends, and if you see something that concerns you, you likely know how to reach out to that person directly. Its users only interact with the people they want to interact with, in other words, which has no doubt contributed to the service's meteoric rise.Put another way, you wouldn't expect the telephone company to take responsibility if you had a disturbing phone call with someone. Besides, Snapchat says it doesn't even save ""Snap"" data, and a major appeal of the platform is that its messages disappear after a short amount of time. Don't forget that Snapchat has a somewhat more ""permanent"" element called ""Stories,"" though. Here, users can post photo or video messages that last for an entire day. Many people use the feature as a sort of public diary, and the stories are viewable by any of a user's friends, if not everyone who follows that user. And that's where you might see something from an individual you don't know but still think is worth reporting -- a bit of content that wasn't meant for you necessarily that's nonetheless worrisome.Snapchat could learn a thing or two from Facebook's updated self-harm features, especially since the app has played a role in young suicides before.While Facebook originally rolled out tools to help American users in February 2015, Tuesday's update brings those features to the entire world and presents clearer options to users.Originally, someone who posted content that was reported by a friend would see a screen inviting them to ""Talk to someone"" or ""Get tips and support."" Now, they can ""talk with a friend"" (emphasis ours), ""contact a helpline"" or tap through for tips and support. Those options will take over a user's screen when they next use Facebook, a representative told HuffPost.""Given that Facebook is the place you’re connected to friends and family, it seemed like a natural fit,"" Dr. Jennifer Guadagno, head of Facebook's suicide prevention team, told The New York Times. If you — or someone you know — need help, please call 1-800-273-8255 for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. If you are outside of the U.S., please visit the International Association for Suicide Prevention for a database of international resources."

He believed it was important to bring up his own struggles in life in order to connect with the campers and make sure that his message resonated with them.Equating sexual violence with a minor ""shoplifting citation"" is slap in the face to the heinousness of sexual violence. And later in the profile, Kennedy devotes an entire paragraph to an anecdote about Winston shooting squirrels with a BB gun. More space is dedicated to the life of a squirrel than the life of the woman who says Winston raped her. In December 2012, Winston was accused of raping then-FSU student Erica Kinsman. Kinsman reported the alleged assault to local Tallahassee law enforcement, who sat on the accusations for 10 months and, according to Kinsman and the prosecutor, seriously mismanaged the case. Kinsman sued FSU, accusing the university of protecting a star athlete instead of investigating the alleged rape, as university officials are obligated to do under Title IX. Because of this lawsuit, the university also faced a federal investigation. Earlier this year, FSU announced that it would make a $950,000 settlement in Kinsman's case. Kinsman and Winston have also sued each other, and those cases are ongoing.Amidst the tangled web of lawsuits and counter-lawsuits (during which an alleged rapist received a multi-million dollar paycheck from the NFL), The New York Times found in their report of Winston's investigation that ultimately ""there was virtually no investigation at all, either by the police or the university.""The New York Times' Walt Bogdanich wrote in 2014: The police did not follow the obvious leads that would have quickly identified the suspect as well as witnesses, one of whom videotaped part of the sexual encounter. After the accuser identified Mr. Winston as her assailant, the police did not even attempt to interview him for nearly two weeks and never obtained his DNA.None of this was mentioned in The Undefeated's 1,100-word profile of Winston.As Deadspin's Tom Ley pointed out, refusing to engage with the parts of Winston's story that aren't so feel-good meant that the profile became nothing more than ""a glorified press release"":It was never meant to offer any critical analysis or frank discussion, but to gently remove words like ""rape” and “cover-up” from conversations about Jameis Winston, and to replace them with ""football IQ"" and ""potential.""Other journalists have been vocal in their criticism of The Undefeated profile: Of course, The Undefeated is not the first major publication to emphasize an alleged sexual abuser's athletic career at the cost of overlooking his violent assault on a woman. It happened with the coverage of Brock Turner.And Daniel Holtzclaw.And Owen Labrie.And Jack Montague.The trope of the promising athlete who valiantly overcomes adversity in the form of a rape allegation is so common that it became an Onion video half a decade ago. But when satire feels so close to real life, it's hard to laugh."

The letter was obtained and printed in full by Palo Alto Weekly.“After the guilty verdict I expected that this case would serve as a very strong deterrent to on-campus assaults, but with the ridiculously lenient sentence that Brock Turner received, I am afraid that it makes a mockery of the whole trial and the ability of the justice system to protect victims of assault and rape,” the letter read. “It seems to me that you really did not accept the jury's findings. We were unanimous in our finding of the defendant's guilt and our verdicts were marginalized based on your own personal opinion.” Turner was arrested on Jan. 18, 2015 after two Stanford graduate students who were cycling by an on-campus frat party spotted him “thrusting his hips atop an unconscious woman lying on the ground.” One of the grad students allegedly shouted at Turner, prompting him to jump off the victim (referred to in the letter as Emily Doe). The student then pursued Turner, who ran from the scene.Turner was convicted of three felony sex abuse charges in March. He was subsequently sentenced to six months in county jail, but will likely only serve three.In justifying the light sentence, Persky said Turner’s age and lack of criminal history factored into his decision.“A prison sentence would have a severe impact on him,” said the judge. “I think he will not be a danger to others.”Persky has faced mounting criticism since the sentencing. Over 1.2 million people signed a petition calling for the judge’s removal from the bench and reports have emerged of prospective jurors boycotting his cases.In the letter to Persky, the unnamed juror in the Turner case slammed the judge for perpetuating a culture that fails to protect survivors of sexual assault.“Justice has not been served in this case,” the juror wrote. “The jury's verdict of guilt on all three felony counts of sexual assault was completely disregarded in an effort to spare the perpetrator a 'hardship.' What message does this send to Emily Doe, and indeed all victims of sexual assault and rape, especially those on college campuses? Your concern was for the impact on the assailant. I vehemently disagree, our concern should be for the victim.”"

Their questioning of Officer William Porter aimed at showing Goodson ignored department procedures and failed to seek medical help.Gray's death triggered rioting and protests and stoked a U.S. debate on police treatment of minorities. Gray was arrested for fleeing officers unprovoked and was bundled into a police van while shackled and not seatbelted, a violation of procedure.Goodson is among six officers charged in Gray's death. He is accused of second-degree depraved heart murder and other charges, and his attorneys have argued that Gray caused his own injuries.During two hours of testimony in Baltimore City Circuit Court, Porter said Goodson was not around after he drove Gray to the Western District station. Gray was unresponsive in the back of the van, he said.""I don't recall where he was,"" Porter testified under questioning by defense attorney Matthew Fraling.He added that Goodson might have been dealing with a second detainee.Porter was present at some of the stops that Goodson made. Prosecutor Michael Schatzow underscored in his questioning of Porter that leaving a prisoner unattended was a violation of police procedure.Schatzow read from a statement from Porter in which he said he had told Goodson during Gray's transport that he should be taken to a hospital.Asked if Goodson had agreed, Porter said, ""Sure.""Porter said that he responded to a call to assist Goodson at the fourth of six stops the van made. He found Gray lying on the van's floor, and helped him onto a bench.A medical examiner's report found that Gray was fatally injured between the second and fourth stops. Judge Barry Williams is deciding the case in a bench trial.Porter's testimony in a case in which he also faces trial was the result of a legal battle that reached Maryland's highest court.Porter's trial on a manslaughter charge ended in a hung jury, and he faces retrial in September. Williams acquitted one officer, Edward Nero, in a second trial.(Writing by Ian Simpson in Washington; Editing by Dan Grebler and Matthew Lewis)"

House Democrats used a routine procedural motion on Tuesday to send a message on the issue, calling for a vote on a bill written by Republican Rep. Peter King of New York that would prohibit people on the terrorist watch lists from buying firearms. And while Republicans had no problem voting against the party-line motion, there are clear signs that Democrats see an opportunity on gun legislation -- and Republicans see a thorny election-year issue.The ""No Fly, No Buy"" legislation, as Democrats have dubbed it, is itself a controversial bill. Critics say it would deny due process rights to people placed on terrorist watch lists, which are famously loose as far as who is included. One terrorist watch list in 2013 included 1.1 million people (though many of those names were spelling variations, and the government has said that only about 25,000 people on that list are U.S. citizens or legal permanent residents). Rep. Charlie Dent (R-Pa.), for one, noted that local law enforcement officials in his district have ended up on the list, as has his chief of staff's mom. In her case, her name was similar to Cat Stevens, the British folk singer who converted to Islam and changed his name to Yusuf Islam. The musician erroneously ended up on a no-fly list, too, and was taken off a plane because his name was similar to someone else being monitored.Regardless, Democrats were quick to issue a round of press releases and tweets Tuesday --marked with #NoFlyNoBuy -- over a pretty standard procedural vote. “It is appalling that days after our nation has suffered such a terrible attack, Republicans would vote to protect suspected terrorists’ ability to arm themselves to the teeth at American gun stores,"" House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in her release.“Republicans’ decision to block the bipartisan ‘No Fly, No Buy’ bill is dangerous and indefensible,"" she said. ""If you’re too dangerous to fly, you’re too dangerous to buy a gun."" Democratic candidates also got in on the act Tuesday, calling on their incumbent Republican opponents to allow a vote on the bill. But what may be more surprising than the outrage Democrats are exhibiting is the openness some Republicans are showing to the legislation.""That sounds like a reasonable proposition,"" conservative Rep. Dave Brat (R-Va.) told reporters on Tuesday, when asked about the King bill. ""I'm not going to commit yes or no on it, but that sounds like a reasonable proposition.""Agriculture Chairman Mike Conaway (R-Texas) also told reporters on Tuesday that it sounded like something he could support, and Rep. Lee Zeldin (R-N.Y.) was spirited Monday night about his desire to see new restrictions on suspected terrorists.On the Senate side, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Tuesday that he suspected the Democratic push for the bill was politically motivated. ""But we're open,"" McConnell said. ""Nobody wants terrorists to have firearms. And we're open to serious suggestions from the experts as to what we might be able to do to be helpful.""Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-Texas) accused Democrats of political posturing too, though he also suggested there was a legitimate problem with certain dangerous people getting their hands on guns.""We have to decide whether we actually want to solve a problem or not, or whether people just want their political talking points,"" Cornyn said Tuesday. ""Right now our Democratic friends seem to be more interested in opportunistically using this tragedy to advance their agenda, rather than working with us to solve problems.""Democrats clearly do see a political angle on the gun issue. But for many, it's also a deeply personal concern.On Tuesday, New York Democrat Nydia Velázquez took to the House floor and, with tears welling in her eyes, read the names of the Orlando shooting victims.Some Democrats have also indicated that they are serious about working through the judicial concerns members have regarding a bill to prevent suspected terrorists from buying guns. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), one of Congress' most outspoken gun control proponents, is offering an amendment to an upcoming appropriations bill that would prevent people on watch lists from buying guns. And Feinstein said Tuesday that the next step for her would be to talk to Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), and then to McConnell.""Which I will do on this,"" Feinstein said, ""because I care a great deal about it.”Laura Barron-Lopez and Jennifer Bendery contributed to this report."

21,BUSINESS,Wall Street Journal Ads Call Out The Paper’s Bias On Climate Change,Ryan Grenoble,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/wall-street-journal-climate-change-ads_us_57602f98e4b071ec19ef45d8,"Well, this is awkward.",2016-06-14,"Rupert Murdoch, Chairman of the News Corporation, which owns the Wall Street Journal.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5760522d1500002a0073a7c7.jpeg?ops=crop_0_122_3500_2396%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Beginning Tuesday and running until the end of the Republican National Convention in July, the most widely circulated print newspaper in the United States will run a series of ads calling out its own bias against climate change.The ads are being paid for by a group calling itself the ""Partnership for Responsible Growth"" and will run twice a week on The Wall Street Journal's Op-Ed page, a place long inhospitable to any sort of science-based climate pieces.(The Journal's climate change denial isn't just limited to the opinion pages, either: A 2015 study conducted by researchers at Rutgers, the University of Michigan and the University of Oslo found WSJ rarely mentions the threats posed by climate change, and, when it does, tends to downplay them.)The Journal did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The first advertisement, published Tuesday, recalls comments made by Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson in 2012 in which he acknowledged ""that increasing CO2 emissions in the atmosphere is going to have ... a warming impact,"" and as a result we would see shifting weather patterns impact crop production and rising sea levels.""If the CEO of the world’s largest oil company accepts the basic physics that humans are heating the climate with excess CO2, why won’t the editorial board of this newspaper?"" The ad asks, rhetorically. ""Isn’t it about time?"" Other topics in the series include a basic primer on the physics of CO2 and how it affects the atmosphere, how rising sea levels might impact the world's major cities, statements from military leaders who see climate change as a ""threat multiplier,"" and more.“The Wall Street Journal is the nation’s largest and most influential newspaper,” former Rep. Walt Minnick (D-Idaho), a co-founder of the Partnership, explained in a release. “What business and Republican leaders are unlikely to have read on its opinion pages is neither the latest science, nor that there is a bipartisan, business-friendly way to combat climate change. If The Journal won’t cover it, we will.”Last December, in response to the historic climate change agreement in Paris, the WSJ's editorial board sneered, ""if climate change really does imperil the Earth, and we doubt it does, nothing coming out of a gaggle of governments and the United Nations will save it.""In sharp contrast to The Journal, last month the editorial board of the Financial Times, a competing publication, predicted the oil industry is facing ""a future of slow and steady decline.""""Instead of railing against climate policies, or paying them lip-service while quietly defying them with investment decisions,"" the FT's editorial board wrote, ""the oil companies will serve their investors and society better if they accept the limits they face, and embrace a future of long-term decline.""CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story said the Partnership for Responsible Growth's ads target the Journal's reporting. If fact, they are meant to call out the paper's editorial board. "

The watchdog group Center for Media and Democracy published a breakdown of creditors that details their affiliations.One such creditor is Roy Spencer, who teaches at the University of Alabama, Huntsville. Spencer, a vocal denier of climate change science who writes a popular blog, has a Ph.D. in meteorology from University of Wisconsin-Madison and was once employed by NASA, according to his website. The Senate often asks him to testify about climate science.Spencer's website claims he ""has never been asked by any oil company to perform any kind of service. Not even Exxon-Mobil.""Yet, Peabody Energy's bankruptcy documents show that Spencer is a creditor. As part of a Greenpeace undercover investigation published in late 2015, Spencer reportedly told Greenpeace representatives that he had received $4,000 from Peabody Energy in exchange for testifying at a hearing about climate science in Minnesota.The documents that were released this week do not say how much money Peabody Energy's creditors were owed, so it's unclear whether the company has ever paid Spencer more than the $4,000 he told Greenpeace about.""The entities listed in Peabody's creditor matrix makes up a very large proportion of the climate denial movement,"" said Nick Surgey, the Center for Media and Democracy's research director. Normally, these payments would be untraceable, Surgey said. It's only because Peabody Energy and its rivals, Arch Coal and Alpha Natural Resources, filed for bankruptcy in the last 12 months that these payments are coming to light.""Just the sheer volume of individuals, scientists, nonprofits and political organizations espousing climate change denial and opposition to efforts to tackle climate change is astonishing,"" said Surgey.The question of whether companies should be allowed to provide funding for researchers has been a sticky one in the scientific community since at least the 1980s, according to David Resnik, a bioethicist for the National Institutes of Health and the chair of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences institutional review board.It's a conflict of interest for companies to fund research that could be good for their business. It might not always lead to bias on the part of the researcher, but it certainly doesn't help avoid the impression of bias, Resnik told The Huffington Post.Different institutions have various rules about what kind of funding needs to be disclosed, he added. For example, government-backed agencies like the NIH have very strict rules about financial conflicts of interest. Universities and peer-reviewed journals usually have some rules, but each institution sets and polices its own rules. ""The point [of disclosure rules] is to try to deal with potential bias and to assure the public’s trust,"" Resnik said.Peabody Energy declined to comment to HuffPost about ""alliances with particular organizations,"" but said that it ""has a track record of advancing responsible energy and environmental policies, and we support organizations that advocate sustainable mining, energy access and clean coal solutions, in line with our company’s leadership in these areas.""Spencer did not return a request for comment.

An extra $30 worth of monthly Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits would also result in beneficiaries eating fewer fast food meals and spending more time cooking at home, according to the statistical analysis of federal survey data by researchers working for the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""Most notably, consumption of tomatoes and yellow vegetables would increase by almost 3 percent and green vegetables by just over 2 percent, while consumption of fast food would fall by over 2.5 percent,"" Patricia Anderson of Dartmouth College and Kristin Butcher of Wellesley College wrote in their report. The study found that about two-thirds of a $30 monthly benefit increase would be used for food, since beneficiaries typically use some of their own money on groceries. A bigger food budget would allow them to use more of their own cash on things like rent and utilities.The improvements would be small, but so are the dietary differences between the 45 million Americans who receive SNAP benefits and everyone else. Though stories abound of SNAP recipients using their benefits for junk food and soda, federal data show food stamp recipients have only marginally worse diets than people who don't get benefits. ""The whole conversation around healthy eating is about nudging people in a better direction,"" Stacy Dean, a nutrition expert with the Center on Budget, said in an interview. Most of the political conversation around food stamps, however, is about nudging people off the program. States are in the process of cutting roughly 1 million Americans from SNAP thanks to the return of a federal time limit on benefits for able-bodied adults without dependents. And House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) endorsed further tightening eligibility restrictions on able-bodied recipients of SNAP benefits when he unveiled his poverty agenda last week. The average monthly benefit is roughly $126 per person. Two-thirds of beneficiaries are either children, elderly or disabled. HuffPost readers: Are you an able-bodied adult getting cut off from SNAP?

It happened in the United States.Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump announced Monday afternoon on Facebook that his campaign was revoking The Washington Post’s press credentials after the paper, briefly, published a headline online that he considered unfair. The Committee to Protect Journalists, better known for tracking press freedom abuses overseas, said that such an action “provides a ready made excuse for authoritarian leaders to crackdown further on independent journalists.”Though Trump has benefited from excessive media attention this campaign cycle, he's simultaneously vilified journalists throughout and his campaign's waged a sustained assault on the the press. The ""phony and dishonest"" Post joined a media blacklist Monday that has already included Politico, Univision, Fusion, The Daily Beast, BuzzFeed, Mother Jones, National Review, The Des Moines Register, and The Huffington Post. Even news organizations receiving credentials for rallies must agree to severe restrictions on their reporting. Trump's demonstrated an authoritarian streak throughout the campaign, from describing pro-Democracy activists massacred by the Chinese government in Tiananmen Square as rioters to praising the strength of Russian president Vladimir Putin, whose country ranks 148 out of 180 on Reporters Without Borders' press freedom index.In December, Trump initially defended Putin when MSNBC host Joe Scarborough claimed the Russian leader had killed journalists. (Dozens of journalists have been killed in Russia in recent years, though their cases often go unresolved.) And in May, Trump suggested Amazon chief and Post owner Jeff Bezos would face an anti-trust investigation if he's a elected president, a threat some viewed as right out of Putin's playbook. On Monday night, Fox News contributor Julie Roginsky also compared Trump to the Russian leader and said such infringements on the press should not happen in the U.S.Trump's rhetoric and actions have also invited comparisons to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who has aggressively clamped down on the press and whose country ranks 151 on the press freedom index. Some journalists have also likened Trump to former Italian Prime Minister and media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, given the former reality star's savvy use of television to fuel his political rise and tendency to bully journalists asking tough questions. In a Tuesday open letter to Trump, journalists from Univision News called his action against the Post ""unprecedented and dangerous.""""There are all too many places on earth where political figures use whatever is at their disposal to punish and silence unfavorable news coverage,"" they wrote. ""The U.S. is not one of those places.""Several journalists and foreign policy experts on Twitter also compared Trump's broadside against the Post to the behavior of authoritarian governments. Trump's demagoguery and strongman rhetoric have raised questions throughout the campaign about what can, or cannot, happen in the United States. Brookings Institution fellow Robert Kagan has argued Trumpism may be a harbinger of fascism and some legal experts, alarmed by the GOP presumptive nominee's attacks on the press and judiciary, see ""contempt for the First Amendment, the separation of powers and the rule of law."" Joel Simon, executive director for the Committee to Protect Journalists, told HuffPost that Trump's tone and rhetoric, and actions of some of his supporters, ""have gotten on our radar"" this election cycle.CPJ has investigated U.S.-based press freedom concerns in the past, but Simon emphasized in a recent interview that the organization's priority is to advocate for ""journalists who are facing threats to their lives or threats to their freedom who are really in situations of imminent peril"" -- grave concerns that currently rise above not providing credentials for events. Journalists from blacklisted news outlets had been able to attend Trump events in the past by lining up with the public, though Trump's security recently kicked out a Politico reporter who entered a rally with a general admission ticket. ""You don’t want to make too direct a comparison because it trivializes the challenges that journalists face in those countries,"" Simon said. ""On the other hand, I do get nervous when politicians campaign so aggressively against the press because it sets the stage for, sort of softens up public opinion if you will, for policies that can be detrimental.""One key difference, Simon stressed, is that the U.S. has a legacy of institutions protecting speech, starting with the First Amendment. It's easier, he said, to turn such heated rhetoric into policy ""where there are no institutions or limited institutions that could restrain it.”Journalist Masha Gessen, who has written critically on Putin and left Russia in 2013 following the passing of anti-gay laws, has similarly expressed hope that U.S. institutions would serve as a bulwark against Trump's worst impulses. In a recent Slate interview, Gessen agreed that Trump's threat against Bezos was a Putin tactic, but noted that the U.S. has much stronger institutions supporting democracy. ""That’s the really huge difference between Trump and Putin,"" Gessen said. ""The worst case scenario -- Trump comes to power -- I think we have to really ask the question, 'How much damage could he do to institutions in four years?'""Charlotte Klein provided research assistance. Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
