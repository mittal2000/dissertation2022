3,HEALTHY LIVING,Researchers Discover New Source Of Airborne Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria,Erin Schumaker,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-scientists-find-ant_n_6972362.html,,2015-04-01,"Cattle lounge in pens at a feedlot near Lubbock, Texas, on Dec. 16, 2013. Some Texas cattle producers are beginning a lengthy climb after a brutal and dispiriting stretch of years of drought. Hundreds of thousands of head in the nation's leading cattle producing state were liquidated since 2011, the stateâs most intense one-year drought on record. (AP Photo/Betsy Blaney)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5c9a906624000086064f5078.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Antibiotic-resistant bacteria from cattle feed yards can become airborne, according to a study to be published in Environmental Health Perspectives this month.Researchers from Texas Tech University collected particle matter samples downwind and upwind of 10 large-scale cattle feed yards within a 200-mile radius of Lubbock, Texas, over six months. The researchers found bacteria containing antibiotic-resistant genes were 4,000 percent more prevalent in the samples collected downwind from the feedlots than in the samples collected upwind. The Texas Tribune described the study area, in the Texas Panhandle, as ""one of the most windswept stretches of the country"" and ""home to a high concentration of industrial cattle feedlots.""""Finding out where these particles are traveling and how far is an important question,"" study co-author Phil Smith said. ""Specifically these gene sequences: What happens when they land? These are tremendously important questions and ones that we are interested in answering.""This is not the first time antibiotic-resistant 'superbugs' have become airborne. A 2012 study found that sneezing, coughing and shaking bedclothes in hospitals can propel superbugs into the air, allowing them to travel on air currents and potentially infect other hospital patients. The Texas study, however, is the first to examine airborne transport of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from feed yards. While it's difficult to say if this specific strain of bacteria will affect the nearby community, it certainly wouldn't be impossible: The notorious MRSA outbreak, which killed more than 18,000 people in the United States in 2005, is one example of a pathogen that first became antibiotic resistant in livestock, but affected human health. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria limit doctors’ ability to treat life-threatening bacterial infections and account for at least 2 million illnesses and 23,000 deaths each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In January, the White House announced that it was increasing funding to fight antibiotic resistance, including measures like educating health care providers to stop prescribing unnecessary antibiotics to patients. Still, the fact remains that 80 percent of the antibiotics sold in the U.S. aren't directly used by humans -- they are used on livestock.Antibiotics prescribed to cattle are not only used to treat disease, but also as a growth promoter. Cows can’t easily absorb the antibiotics, so they are passed back into the environment (along with 'super bacteria' not killed by the antibiotics) when the cows expel waste, and are released into the air when the fecal material from the cow pen floor dries out. Researchers have long known that antibiotic-resistant bacteria from livestock fecal matter could be transmitted to humans through manure used on agricultural farms and contaminated runoff water, but this is the first study to indicate that the antibiotic-resistant particles could become airborne and ingested by humans who come in contact with them. The researchers estimate that the antibiotic-resistant bacteria could remain active for days or weeks after being deposited on skin, soil or water and could spread far past the borders of the feed yards by blowing dust, a common weather pattern in the Southern high plains, and one that could become even more common with global warming. Still, co-author Greg Mayer cautioned that the study isn't meant to be alarmist. ""If you think about it, every time you take a trip to the hospital you have a great risk of breathing in, touching or ingesting antibiotic-resistant bacteria -- but the steps from there that lead to an infection are multifold. Our own immune systems take care of most of that on a daily basis or we'd be sick all the time,"" Mayer said. ""We just want to make sure we don't deplete our first line of defense against bacterial diseases."""
4,ENTERTAINMENT,Faith: 20 Years Strong,"Kelsey Minor, ContributorJournalist and Author, Unfinished Business",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/faith-20-years-strong_b_6977612.html,"When you look up the word 'Incomparable' it means ""unable to be compared.'

It's also the name of the newest album from Faith Evans. The R&B singer from New Jersey has a music career spanning 20 years. Faith was the first female artist to be signed to Bad Boy Entertainment in 1994 and her first studio album 'Faith' was released in 1995. Faith took to the stage to perform some of her greatest hits and songs from her new album 'Incomparable' that was released in November. On a Sunday night in March in New York City she was the headliner during the monthly showcase of R&B Spotlight that's held at Sounds of Brazil or what is also know as SOBs. Before Faith took the stage, super fans of hers got to hear unsigned talented artist as well J. Drew of the famous Clark Sisters & Sheard family. If you've never been to a Faith Evans show it mirrors every aspect of her life. The singer has been through a great deal of heartache, pain, and exciting time. That's why I feel it's very fitting to say that her performances are much of the same. Faith takes the listener on an emotional, rocky, yet fun journey. Without a doubt she brought the house with her energy and her legion of fans known as #Faithfuls. Personally, I was excited to be at the show but I was even more excited that I would be getting the opportunity to spend about five minutes with Faith to interview an amazing singer whose songs I have heard playing on the radio since I was 12 years old. I can recall hearing ""Soon As I Get Home"" blasting from some of my other sister's rooms as I run through the house. So the opportunity to interview her was five minutes well spent. Tunnel Vision Marketing & Consulting is the reason I was able to knock out one of my interview goals. I met Faith for our brief five-minute chat inside of her dressing room after the show. I wanted to know how she has remained such a force in the music industry for so long, how she's maintained herself over the years and what people can expect from her new music. KM: Faith, thank you so much for this opportunity. You definitely brought the house down tonight? How did it feel being up there in front of all those ride-or-die Faith fans? Faith: Oh I had so much fun, I wish that I could have done a longer set but the band that I performed with I haven't worked with them before but I threw in two extra songs and they were able to pick it up. It was just so much fun, it's always good to come back home because the home city is always there to support. KM: Let's talk about the album 'Incomparable' for a moment. What's different about this one than say some of your previous albums? Faith: Well, first this is a concept album and details a lot of things that I was going through whether it be with my family or conversationally you know post divorce and getting back into dating. The album really captures a two year period of my life It was so great to bring it all together and make a story out of it. Also to me it's my best album so far. Now I have others coming but it's a really good album to me. All I really wanted was for people to say it's a good album and I have been getting that. KM: What makes Faith Evans strong? Faith: First and foremost my family makes me strong. My mother and my grandmother made me strong. My children make me strong and the fact that I wake up at four in the morning to go work out makes me strong. But most of all God keeps me, makes me, made me, fulfills me, you know he is why I am strong. KM: And you look amazing, let's just go ahead and say that too! Faith: Thank you, thank you so much. It's true Faith Evans has transformed her body but her soul remains true to form. Which brings me back to the new album 'Incomparable' and why it is appropriately titled during this time in her life. In her life she has seen her fair share of triumphant times and pain but the journey has been hers and no one could compare to handling it the way that she has. Faith pours her soul into her music and once she hits the stage the #Faithfuls feel it too. 'Incomparable' is available now everywhere music is sold. Give it a listen and let Faith take you on a musical journey."

When I was younger while visiting my Cherokee uncle, Goat Carson, in New Orleans he always talked about how music was a form of prayer, a powerful kind of medicine. It shaped my understanding to recognize that there is something ancestral and powerful about music that is transformative. When I meet musicians who are aware of the responsibility to raise peoples spirits, celebrate life, and engage community, I almost always enjoy their music no matter what genre.

I think that's the most important thing you can do with music."" -Nahko BearJust as the polyrhythms of New Orleans music tells the story of Indians and Slaves coming together in unity, Nahko and Medicine for the People bring the ancestral wisdom of the Hawaiian Islands, through song. The islands are exploding with vibrant, colourful life adorned with flowers, tropical fruits, lush beaches, waterfalls, and canyons. This feeling and the Aloha way of life radiates through their music.Aloha is derived from Polynesian roots and is associated with sharing the essence of life, breath, affection, peace, compassion and love. A culture this rich needs to be shared with the world as we are all yearning for stories that bring mutual respect, healing and peace. Though there are many phenomenal traditional Hawaiian musicians, few travel beyond the islands openly sharing this inherent wisdom. I could be in any location listening to NMFTP, and if I close my eyes I will feel as if I'm letting a waterfall pour over me somewhere in paradise. Indeed every single part of our planet is paradise if we treat it that way.Kuleana is a Hawaiian word that means ""responsibility"" and is often associated with honouring the land or the ancestors and living in a sacred way. Project Kuleana was created by three Native Hawaiian men who share the perspective that kuleana is what makes music Hawaiian. A kuleana to the 'āina (land) and our strong ancestral connection to it. From a cross-cultural perspective true musicians understand this everywhere but may have different terms to describe it.I am always impressed with musicians who are outspoken about issues of justice, or who speak openly in regards to their love for the land. Bonnie Raitt has spoken out against fracking that is polluting our waters. Neil Young is a true hero with his support of native issues, honoring treaties, and his stance against GMO's. Tab Benoit and Voice of the Wetlands with Cyril Neville have also brought much needed awareness to the importance of coastal wetlands. There are many others, and each of them deserves a tip of the hat for giving us great music and holding a strong public stance about issues that matter to us all.One of the most critical environmental issues of our time is banning Fracking everywhere because it destroys our Water, our communities and our planet"" - Bonnie RaittMedicine for the People includes Dustin Thomas who is an exceptional song-writer, beat-boxer, guitarist and vocalist whose hair is almost as big as his heart. Keeping a healthy feminine balance to the band is Hope Medford on djembe. Justin Chittams, with a background in marine biology, plays drums. Chase Makai, originally from Australia, brings the free-spirited vibes of surfing and skate boarding to the band through his dynamic 12-string guitar. Nahko, a down-to-earth, sweet and humble person is quick to laugh and embrace new friends. His past has taught him the power of forgiveness and he embodies a true spirit of kindness, making him a perfect emissary for the Aloha spirit. His song-writing, guitar, and piano skills blend all of these energies into a beautifully warm and inspiring expression. When he's not playing music, you are likely to find him in the garden or helping Jason Fox at Vetiver Solutions in Hilo. Take a look at this great documentary about him here.If you are needing to lighten the load and refresh your spirit with a passion for life, I highly recommend checking out Nahko and Medicine for the People. Though I have seen them live many times, I was first introduced to them in the video above. The footage is as inspiring as the music, and this YouTube masterpiece has been seen by over 3 million people. Let this inspiration carry around the world as people begin to awaken their hearts through the power and medicine of music.***Post originally appeared at UPLIFT***"

I think that's the most important thing you can do with music."" -Nahko BearJust as the polyrhythms of New Orleans music tells the story of Indians and Slaves coming together in unity, Nahko and Medicine for the People bring the ancestral wisdom of the Hawaiian Islands, through song. The islands are exploding with vibrant, colourful life adorned with flowers, tropical fruits, lush beaches, waterfalls, and canyons. This feeling and the Aloha way of life radiates through their music.Aloha is derived from Polynesian roots and is associated with sharing the essence of life, breath, affection, peace, compassion and love. A culture this rich needs to be shared with the world as we are all yearning for stories that bring mutual respect, healing and peace. Though there are many phenomenal traditional Hawaiian musicians, few travel beyond the islands openly sharing this inherent wisdom. I could be in any location listening to NMFTP, and if I close my eyes I will feel as if I'm letting a waterfall pour over me somewhere in paradise. Indeed every single part of our planet is paradise if we treat it that way.Kuleana is a Hawaiian word that means ""responsibility"" and is often associated with honouring the land or the ancestors and living in a sacred way. Project Kuleana was created by three Native Hawaiian men who share the perspective that kuleana is what makes music Hawaiian. A kuleana to the 'āina (land) and our strong ancestral connection to it. From a cross-cultural perspective true musicians understand this everywhere but may have different terms to describe it.I am always impressed with musicians who are outspoken about issues of justice, or who speak openly in regards to their love for the land. Bonnie Raitt has spoken out against fracking that is polluting our waters. Neil Young is a true hero with his support of native issues, honoring treaties, and his stance against GMO's. Tab Benoit and Voice of the Wetlands with Cyril Neville have also brought much needed awareness to the importance of coastal wetlands. There are many others, and each of them deserves a tip of the hat for giving us great music and holding a strong public stance about issues that matter to us all.One of the most critical environmental issues of our time is banning Fracking everywhere because it destroys our Water, our communities and our planet"" - Bonnie RaittMedicine for the People includes Dustin Thomas who is an exceptional song-writer, beat-boxer, guitarist and vocalist whose hair is almost as big as his heart. Keeping a healthy feminine balance to the band is Hope Medford on djembe. Justin Chittams, with a background in marine biology, plays drums. Chase Makai, originally from Australia, brings the free-spirited vibes of surfing and skate boarding to the band through his dynamic 12-string guitar. Nahko, a down-to-earth, sweet and humble person is quick to laugh and embrace new friends. His past has taught him the power of forgiveness and he embodies a true spirit of kindness, making him a perfect emissary for the Aloha spirit. His song-writing, guitar, and piano skills blend all of these energies into a beautifully warm and inspiring expression. When he's not playing music, you are likely to find him in the garden or helping Jason Fox at Vetiver Solutions in Hilo. Take a look at this great documentary about him here.If you are needing to lighten the load and refresh your spirit with a passion for life, I highly recommend checking out Nahko and Medicine for the People. Though I have seen them live many times, I was first introduced to them in the video above. The footage is as inspiring as the music, and this YouTube masterpiece has been seen by over 3 million people. Let this inspiration carry around the world as people begin to awaken their hearts through the power and medicine of music.***Post originally appeared at UPLIFT***"

This year, two fantastic women senators will mark the ends of their historic Senate careers. Senators Barbara Boxer and Barbara Mikulski have served a collective 70 years in Congress. In those decades, they've established themselves as strong environmental champions.Barbara MikulskiSenator Mikulski has represented Maryland in Congress since she was first elected to the House in 1976. She is now the longest-serving female member of Congress in history.Mikulski has demonstrated a consistent commitment to environmental protection and clean energy throughout her decades in Congress. She has earned a lifetime score of 84 percent from the League of Conservation Voters. She's consistently voted to act on climate change, to support clean energy and to improve and uphold bedrock environmental laws like the Clean Air Act.Mikulski's environmental passion has been saving the Chesapeake Bay. According to her own website, ""Mikulski fights to improve the Bay's health and looks out for the people who depend on it for their livelihoods."" A report from E&E News described Mikulski as someone who saw ""the estuary as not just an ecological gem, but a driver of the region's blue-collar economy, providing jobs for watermen and shellfish for restaurants, and drawing tourists to the state."" Mikulski has consistently worked to improve the bay's water quality, habitats and fisheries. In a statement on her retirement, Will Baker, president of the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, said, ""It is hard to imagine how the Chesapeake Bay will survive without Sen. Mikulski. Just as her beloved oyster is a keystone species in the Bay's ecology, Sen. Mikulski has been a political cornerstone of support for saving the Bay.""Barbara BoxerFirst elected to the House of Representatives in 1982 using the slogan ""Barbara Boxer Gives a Damn,"" the junior senator from California has lived up to her promise. Boxer has given a damn time and again when it comes to environmental protection. Boxer has not only earned a lifetime score of 90 percent from the League of Conservation Voters, but she has been a leader on many of the most important issues in recent decades.As the chairperson and now the ranking member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Boxer has led the charge to fight off attacks on lifesaving Clean Air Act protections. In 2010, Boxer helped defeat a resolution that would have overturned the EPA's scientific finding that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare. In 2011, Boxer led the opposition to a resolution that would have overturned the EPA's regulation to control air pollution that crosses state lines. In 2012, Boxer again helped lead the opposition in stopping a resolution that sought to block the EPA's first-ever standards to control mercury and other hazardous air pollution from power plants.In recent years Boxer has been a critical leader in stopping the Keystone XL Pipeline and working to forge solutions to comprehensively address the dangerous carbon pollution that causes climate change.In addition, Boxer has been a champion for safe drinking water, leading efforts to reduce arsenic and lead in drinking water and to improve community right-to-know protections regarding drinking water contaminants. She has also worked tirelessly to preserve California's precious public lands. Boxer has protected more than 1 million acres of federal public land in California as wilderness, including along Northern California's Coast in Big Sur and the Los Padres Forest. Boxer also championed legislation that converted Pinnacles National Monument and San Francisco's Presidio into national parks, and legislation that expanded Sequoia National Park.Looking AheadI know we'll miss these two green champions when they leave the Senate at the end of the year. However, the Senate women have come a long way, thanks in large part to the leadership and example of Mikulski and Boxer. We now have a tremendous bench of women senators who will carry the torch -- like recent Running Clean leaders Jeanne Shaheen and Mazie Hirono.We'll be looking forward to the new generation for leadership in climate action and creating a clean energy future, but we'll be sure to look back at Mikulski and Boxer for inspiration."
8,POLITICS,Mike Pence's Religious Freedom Law Condemned As Discriminatory By Evan Bayh,Sam Stein,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/religious-freedom-law-mike-pence_n_6980088.html,,2015-03-31,"UNITED STATES - FEBRUARY 4: Gov. Mike Pence, R-Ind., testifies during the House Education and the Workforce Committee hearing on 'State of American Schools and Workplaces: Expanding Opportunity in America's Schools and Workplaces' on Wednesday, Feb. 4, 2015. (Photo By Bill Clark/CQ Roll Call)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f0ba3c000020010e00ea.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Retired Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.) sharply criticized his home state governor on Tuesday for signing a controversial ""religious freedom"" law that he said would unambiguously invite discrimination against gays and lesbians. In an interview with The Huffington Post, Bayh called on Indiana Gov. Mike Pence to either repeal the state's Religious Freedom Restoration Act or push a bill that would make lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in Indiana a protected class. Bayh said that efforts by Pence to argue that the bill won't invite anti-gay discrimination by Indiana businesses lack any sober-minded legal understanding of the statute.""I think the governor needs a good lawyer,"" he said. ""I’m not really joking. Because I take him at his word that he doesn’t favor discrimination. And there are some parts, some effects that the law might have that may be benign. ... But there are other effects that are not benign. And by its very language -- and it’s the difference between the federal law and other state laws, combined with the fact that we don’t have an anti-discrimination statute in our state -- on its face, it would allow individuals and for-profit businesses to deny service to their fellow citizens on religious grounds. So it would allow discrimination.""Bayh's condemnation of the new law, which has yet to take effect, is the latest from a growing line of Democrats. But owing to his stature in the state, and the fact that he could end up running for the open Senate seat there in 2016, his words ratchet up the political pressure being placed on Pence. A number of businesses have already either cancelled expansions in Indiana or expressed deep concern with the law. Several cities and states, meanwhile, have restricted non-essential travel for public officials to the state.""Every day this is left to fester out there, our state is held up to further damage and attack, so clearly something needs to be done,"" said Bayh. ""And the sooner the better.""Pence held a news conference on Tuesday to say that he would push for a clarifying measure to the law without elaborating much on what language he hoped to see. He simultaneously argued that the debate was being maliciously misconstrued by the national media, noting that many other states have also passed RFRA laws and that a federal one is currently on the books. But critics have called his pushback unconvincing. The Indiana law, they note, has important technical differences. It would, for instance, allow individuals to cite religious beliefs when denying services in transactions that don't involve a government entity (as opposed to dealing only with those transactions that do). Bayh added that the context of the law's passage was important. Those pushing the bill, he argued, envisioned RFRA as a sword used by businesses to refuse services to gay couples, as opposed to a shield to protect religious minorities from government interference. ""I’m sure people who are for this legislation are telling him, 'Look, this is all it does. It deals with these benign instances.' And he needs someone who really knows the law to sit down with him and say, 'Well governor, that’s true but that’s not the whole truth because it would allow these other things that you don’t favor.' And he needs to focus on that,"" said Bayh. Bayh, who retired from the Senate in 2010, has been semi-regularly engaged in politics since his departure, most notably on issues like debt and deficit reduction. His decision to jump in so deeply on a hot cultural matter underscores the growing comfort that even centrist Democrats now have in defending LGBT causes. It also suggests that he may be envisioning a return to office. Bayh has nearly $10 million left in his bank account. Asked if he was contemplating running for the seat of retiring Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), he didn't say no, but also didn't seem particularly eager. ""I’m flattered by the speculation,"" he said. ""I guess it would be bad if you get to the point where nobody ever asks you, right? But I think that’s very unlikely, simply because -- well for a variety of factors, that’s very unlikely.""Additional reporting by Maxwell Tani."

The largest-ever U.S. municipal junk bond sale remains in limbo after Indiana learned that a Pakistani company backing a fertilizer plant financed by the biggest borrowing in state history is linked to explosives causing the most U.S. casualties in Afghanistan. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f0c11f00002501257cb5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over the last 20 years, 19 states have passed laws modeled on the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which was enacted in 1993 with broad bipartisan support. But just this year, almost the same number, 15, have seen such bills introduced, generating enormous controversy across the country, particularly in Indiana, where Gov. Mike Pence signed the new state RFRA into law.Why the huge uptick now? As one of those involved in the original drafting and passage of RFRA in 1993, I think it's a combination of the perceived dangers to the far right from the move towards LGBT marriage equality and the perceived opportunity created just last year by the Supreme Court's 5-4 rewriting of RFRA in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby.Even before the Supreme Court agreed to decide the marriage-equality issue, the far right has highlighted the supposed dangers to small businesses like bakers and florists who do not want to serve LGBT couples because of religious objections. Under RFRA as passed in 1993, and under the protection from the First Amendment's ""free exercise"" doctrine that it was meant to restore, RFRA wouldn't have offered much help. First, neither had been applied to non-religious corporations, which had never been thought to have religious-freedom rights. Second, it would have been very hard to argue that a neutral law banning discrimination against LGBT people would have created a ""substantial burden"" on actual religious exercise, which is required to qualify for a RFRA-type exemption. For example, in one case the Supreme Court rejected the claim that requiring federal welfare recipients to submit Social Security numbers was such a burden even when it conflicted with an applicant's religious beliefs. And even if such a burden were created by obeying an anti-discrimination or other general law, pre-Hobby Lobby law would not have helped a religious claimant: As the Supreme Court ruled in rejecting a religious exemption to a requirement that a religious farmer withhold Social Security taxes, such an exemption would improperly ""operate to impose the employer's religious faith on the employees"" and others. But then came Hobby Lobby.In that case, writing for a bare majority of the Court, Justice Samuel Alito ruled that religious objections by a corporation's owners exempted them under RFRA from providing contraceptive coverage through insurance to employees under the Affordable Care Act. As Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg explained in dissent, rather than interpreting RFRA to restore prior case law, the majority interpreted it as going beyond prior Court decisions to maximize benefits to religious claimants. In particular, she explained, the Court effectively rewrote RFRA so that it could be invoked by for-profit corporations, and so that the original law protecting individuals against a ""substantial burden"" on the exercise of religion was transformed to allow claims by a business owner that complying with a neutral law offended their religious beliefs in some way. Under the majority's view, Justice Ginsburg suggested, RFRA could be interpreted to ""require exemptions"" in cases where religious beliefs were used to justify actions that discriminated on the basis of race, gender, and sexual orientation. Pointedly, Justice Alito responded only that ""prohibitions on racial discrimination"" would be safe from a RFRA exemption claim, but said nothing about gender or LGBT status.So for far-right activists and legislators concerned about marriage equality and other LGBT rights, Hobby Lobby provided the perfect opportunity: Pass state RFRA laws and effectively grant a religious exemption claim from LGBT anti-discrimination laws and local ordinances, based on the Court's rewriting of RFRA's language. Indeed, in communicating with supporters about the Indiana RFRA law, the far-right Family Research Council specifically called it the ""Hobby Lobby bill."" Even better, rhetoric directed at outsiders could be cloaked in general language about protecting religious freedom, not attacking LGBT rights. Supporters could even invoke Democratic supporters of RFRA like President Clinton and claim that neither RFRA nor its state counterparts had been interpreted to allow discrimination, as Indiana Gov. Pence has tried to do. These claims ignore the fact that it wasn't until last year that the Supreme Court effectively rewrote the language in RFRA so that it was transformed from a shield for religious liberty into a sword against anti-discrimination protections. And previous supporters like President Clinton have made clear their opposition to this year's state RFRA proposals.Under pressure, the neutral façade of recent state RFRA proposals has crumbled. When pushed to amend a state RFRA proposal in Georgia to make clear that it could not be used against anti-discrimination ordinances, a Georgia legislator admitted that one of the reasons for the bill was to allow it to be invoked by the small business owner who had religious objections to providing services to an LGBT couple. And when an amendment was added in the Georgia House Judiciary Committee to state that the RFRA bill was not to be used against discrimination laws, the bill was promptly tabled on March 26, with a supporter stating that the amendment would ""gut"" the bill. As of now, the fate of RFRA bills in Georgia and elsewhere is uncertain, and Gov. Pence has asked the legislature for an amendment to ""clarify"" that Indiana's RFRA law cannot be used to deny services to anyone. That would be a welcome step -- one that flies in the face of the clear intent of some of the bill's backers, which was clearly to enshrine such a ""right"" for Indiana businesses. Language has been adopted elsewhere to make clear that state RFRAs cannot be used against anti-discrimination bills; such a provision is currently in Texas' RFRA, although there is a proposal to remove it. Before Hobby Lobby, such language might not have been necessary. After Hobby Lobby, it is crucial."

Such laws hurt LGBTI people and their allies and compromise the ability of the United States to speak out against endemic violence against LGBTI individuals across the globe.   We have seen faith leaders around the world support efforts to discriminate against LGBTI people -- in the Philippines, Uganda, Russia and elsewhere. Just this month, Indonesia's central body of Islamic clerics, Majelis Ulama Indonesia, issued a fatwa, or religious edict, that calls for whipping and even the death penalty for men or women engaged in same-sex relations. Does Indiana really want to be seen in such company?When laws reinforce and legitimize discrimination, when the state treats some people as second class, second rate or worse -- as criminals on the basis of their sexual orientation or gender identity, it invites the broader public to do the same. We know that discriminatory attitudes and laws spark homophobic and transphobic violence. And worse, the deeper the stigma, the more likely it is that anti-LGBTI violence is unreported, undocumented and unpunished.Using religion as a pretext for discrimination only deepens the offense.It is heartening to see the swift condemnation against Indiana's new law from state governments, technology leaders, athletic organizations and community organizations. The pressure should be kept up, even as the governor and lawmakers say they want to ""clarify"" the law's intent.Though these laws must be rolled back and others like them opposed, over the last decades the United States has made great progress toward LGBTI equality. Advances within the United States have raised our credibility and potential to join with other countries to make progress on LGBTI rights. Last month, the State Department appointed Randy Berry as the first-ever Special Envoy for the Human Rights of LGBT Persons. ""Defending and promoting the human rights of LGBT persons is at the core of our commitment to advancing human rights globally -- the heart and conscience of our diplomacy,"" Secretary of State John Kerry said at the time.Yet, if states can get away with passing discriminatory laws, it will not only hurt those in Indiana, Arkansas and other states considering such laws, it will utterly undermine the potential good of the U.S. diplomatic voice in advocating for LGBTI rights globally."

Founded in 1921, the chain was a go-to retailer for electronics before becoming increasingly irrelevant in the digital age.Judge Brendan Shannon, in Delaware bankruptcy court, approved a sale of the stores to the Standard General hedge fund, which plans to keep most of them open under a deal in which Sprint will occupy one-third of each space.The sale could preserve about 7,500 jobs, and allow RadioShack to stay in business, a big challenge for retailers who file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.The deal had been in doubt when RadioShack’s largest lender, Salus Capital Partners, on Friday said it would make a more lucrative bid over the weekend.The bid never came, but Salus still fought the proposed Standard General deal, alleging this week that the auction was a sham in which RadioShack chose Standard General despite Salus' better, $271 million, all-cash offer.RadioShack insisted that Standard General's bid was worth $56 million more than Salus', even though most of it would be paid in the form of debt forgiveness rather than cash.Time was of the essence, with RadioShack saying it needed to finalize a deal by Wednesday to avoid paying April rent.On Tuesday, Shannon sided with RadioShack, calling Standard General's bid ""economically superior"" even before accounting for the ""terribly important benefit of saving more than 7,000 jobs and saving a century-old American retail icon.""RadioShack also faced protest from a separate lender group demanding indemnification from a $129 million lawsuit against it related to RadioShack’s bankruptcy. RadioShack agreed to set aside $12 million in reserve to help the group defend that lawsuit, though Shannon denied other protections sought by the group.Federal bankruptcy rules give companies in Chapter 11 only a few months to decide whether to keep or break leases, making restructuring particularly tough for retailers. Chains like Borders Group, Loehmann’s Inc and Coldwater Creek all went out of business after filing for bankruptcy in recent years. "

Picasso's painting alone is estimated to sell for $12-18 million.And now, we have at last the chance to see the exceptional documentary by Wim Wenders, ""The Salt of the Earth,"" about the famous Brazilian photographer Sebastião Salgado. It was screened for just a few days in December, to become eligible for an Oscar nomination, and is now back in theaters.Be sure not to miss this documentary, which will introduce you to the beautiful and heartbreaking images captured by Salgado over decades of traveling around the world and documenting what he saw, from the gold mines of Brazil to the famine and war in Africa.

Pakistan on March 29 evacuated more than 500 of its citizens from Yemen by jumbo jet and sent a naval frigate to rescue others stranded in the war-torn country, officials said. AFP PHOTO / Banaras KHAN (Photo credit should read BANARAS KHAN/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc148a02300005000d0c7bc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pakistan, which faces the challenge of terrorism at home, seems ready to join the Saudi-led coalition against the Shiite Houthi rebels in Yemen. On Monday, a senior Pakistani government official indicated  that the country would send troops to the Kingdom. Though Pakistan's defense minister denied the claim that a decision about military support had been made, he arrived in Saudi Tuesday to decide the next steps. And late last week, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's office vowed that any threat to Saudi Arabia would ""evoke a strong response"" from Islamabad. But joining the Saudis in their latest war would polarize Pakistan, which is home to several Muslim sects. Pakistan would also incur the ire of its neighbor, Iran, with whom Pakistan's Shiites -- about 20 percent of the population  -- maintain close ties. Although Riyadh and Islamabad have been close allies  for decades, part of Pakistan's problem with Islamist radicals stems from Saudi funding for religious schools that teach a fundamentalist Wahhabi doctrine. Pakistan is still paying the price for its initial involvement in the Afghan proxy war between the United States and the former Soviet Union in which Saudi Arabia played a critical role. Support for the Afghan Mujahedeen during the 1980s encouraged extremism, terrorism and sectarianism in Pakistan, changing Pakistani society significantly. Involvement in a new, distant war in Yemen is unlikely to have a different result on Pakistan's internal cohesion. By the time I moved out of Pakistan in 1997, the country was witnessing a surge of sectarian killings. Extremist Sunnis, inspired by puritan Wahhabi teachings, were targeting educated Shiites, forcing them to emigrate. Extremist groups like Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi targeted Shiite doctors, engineers, lawyers and professors. This was the result of sectarian hatred taught at Saudi-funded madrasas originally set up to recruit and train foot soldiers for the anti-Soviet jihad in Afghanistan. After the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, Pakistan's intelligence service had used the madrasas to recruit fighters to fight in Kashmir against India and to support the Taliban in Afghanistan.  The madrasas were attractive for poor Pakistani families who weren't able to send their children to schools or even to feed them daily. One-third of Pakistan's nearly 200 million people live below the poverty line, subsisting on less than one dollar a day per family. Madrasas provided children free housing, food and clothing alongside religious education. According to the inspector general of Punjab police, hundreds of religious seminaries in Pakistan, especially in Punjab province, are foreign funded. The curriculum of these madrasas conformed to puritanical Saudi Wahhabi beliefs, disregarding the religious syncretism of the India-Pakistan subcontinent. Many madrasa students imbibed hatred towards sects other than the Wahhabis, which later manifested itself in sectarian attacks. Saudi Arabia's concern after 1979 about Iranian influence also played a part in encouraging extremist attacks on Pakistani Shiites. The Wahhabis consider Shiites as heretics while the Saudis also tend to see them as allies of Iran.The rationale for Pakistan's involvement in the Saudi-funded Afghan war during the 1980s was similar to the reasoning currently being offered for Pakistani involvement in the conflict in Yemen. The Saudi-Pakistan relationship has been close and rests on mutual dependence of the two countries' elites. Pakistani troops were stationed in the Kingdom during the 1980s to protect the royal family. Prime Minister Sharif and his family lived in Saudi Arabia during their years in exile from 2000-2007. Despite being armed with nuclear weapons, Pakistan is perennially cash-strapped. The Saudis have traditionally been generous in supporting Pakistan with hard currency. They have also paid for expensive weapons for the Pakistani military from other countries  (usually the United States). Over a million Pakistani expatriates work in Saudi Arabia and their remittances are critical for Pakistan's economy. Last year, Riyadh gave a $1.5 billion loan to Pakistan to overcome a hard currency shortage. At the Saudis' request, 2,500 Pakistani retired army and police officials joined Bahrain's anti-riot force in cracking down on the Bahraini Shiite uprising. The Pakistan military, as well as civilian leaders like Prime Minister Sharif, see partnership with the Saudis as beneficial in economic and military terms. Saudi backing has also been important for advancing Pakistan's strategic objective of maintaining military preparedness against India, a much larger neighbor, and wresting the disputed territory of Kashmir from it through an insurgency.For their part, the Saudis got a chance to spread their version of Islam through the wars in Afghanistan and Kashmir. Close ties with Pakistan, the world's only Muslim-majority country with nuclear weapons, helps the Saudis stake their claim as leaders of the Islamic world. The Kingdom holds Islam's most sacred sites and sees only Iran as its rival in speaking for the world's Muslims. The spread of Wahhabism in Pakistan has been detrimental to Iran, because it advanced Saudi interests and exacerbated anti-Shiite sentiment in the region. Relations between Pakistan and Iran have suffered several setbacks beginning with the assassination of Iran's consul-general in Lahore, murdered by SSP terrorists and accentuated by killings of Shiite pilgrims headed to Iran near the Pakistan-Iranian border. By siding with Saudi Arabia in Yemen, Pakistan is in danger of being sucked into a conflict driven by sectarian factors. Iranian-backed Shiite rebels in Yemen are deployed on the border close to Riyadh and that has created shockwaves throughout the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. But the instability in Yemen poses no direct threat to Pakistan's security or other critical interests. By getting involved in the Yemen conflict, Pakistan risks sectarian conflict at home in addition to being drawn into a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran in the Middle East. Pakistan has paid a heavy price due to terrorism, losing some 30,000 lives over the last two decades. Pakistan's interests might be better served by working on better diplomatic relations with neighboring countries, especially Afghanistan and India, and focusing on eradicating the growing radicalization within its society. Entering a distant war for Saudi Arabia will do little to help Pakistan's already precarious condition."

After a long, painful night in the emergency room, a CT scan confirmed what we feared: Andrew had a tumor behind his left eye. An MRI was needed to get a clearer and more detailed picture of the horror we were facing. On that first occasion, the MRI tech took him out of my arms and I listened to my son shriek my name over and over again with his arms flailing as he was carried down a very long, very white hallway. ""Maaaama!! Maaaama!!! Mamaaaa!!!"" Hearing his screams left me heartbroken and incredulous. It seemed like unnecessary trauma for a child who had already been through so much. Following his MRI and a biopsy, Andrew was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma, a type of bone cancer. The next time Andrew had a scan, my husband and I requested that we be allowed into the room with him until he fell asleep (from the anesthesia). The anesthesiologist looked at us skeptically, but he let us in. When we walked into the sterile room with the big whirring machine, I think we were all terrified. Andrew was afraid to lie down, and my husband and I were afraid of what the test would find. I was trying to convince Andrew to relax on the table by rubbing his head and telling him he was safe and would be OK. But it wasn't working. And then my husband was inspired: ""The mask is part of your spacesuit!"" he told Andrew. ""You need to breathe different air because you are going to a different atmosphere!"" He told him that the MRI machine was a rocket ship, and he would be traveling to different planets and visiting funny aliens who told jokes. He told Andrew that he if he could be brave, he would get to see amazing things. The tension in the room disappeared. Everyone was smiling. Andrew decided he would wear the mask and be brave. He relaxed on the table, quickly fell asleep, and we left the room. Since that time, Andrew has had at least 15 more MRIs. He currently returns every six months as part of his follow-up care. With each one, my husband tells a new story. ""The mask smells stinky because you are going back in time to see dinosaurs! They fart A LOT! It's OK!"" The MRI has doubled as a time machine, a rocket ship to circle the earth, a UFO to visit alien nations and even a brain transfer machine. Following one of his scans, the anesthesiologist returned to our room to tell us that Andrew had done well, and that it had been the smoothest parent involvement he had ever experienced. Andrew turned 7 this year, and now actually looks forward to his MRIs. (I wish I could say the same.) A month ago, as I was tucking him into bed, he said, ""I can't wait for my rocket ship ride so that I can come back and tell my friends what Jupiter and Venus look like!"" Andrew had his most recent MRI three weeks ago. It marked four years post-treatment. His trip into outer space was a success! My favorite part of the story: His tests were all clear.

AFP PHOTO / DAMIEN MEYER (Photo credit should read DAMIEN MEYER/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb167422100006401c734b8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In August 2014 I wrote an essay called ""Birds and Us: Should Cormorants Be Killed to Save Salmon?"" in response to Felicity Barringer's essay in the New York Times called ""Taking Up Arms Where Birds Feast on Buffet of Salmon."" Ms. Barringer's essay dealt with the situation in Oregon's Columbia River where salmon living in the river were killed off due to hydroelectric dams, and are now increasing in number. Double-crested cormorants, who like to eat salmon, have become aware of this and are a threat to the fish. Many people, including conservation biologists, now say: ""Shoot the birds."" Others, such as the National Audubon Society's Stan Senner, argue that killing some of the birds who make up 25 percent of the birds' western population ""is an extreme measure, totally inappropriate."" Mr. Senner said ""it was possible to shoo them away, noting 'They came from somewhere else. They can go back to somewhere else.'"" He also notes, ""We're not persuaded they have fully explored ways of improving habitats elsewhere, or other means of dispersing"" these birds.I thoroughly agreed with Mr. Stenner that the cormorants shouldn't be shot. The guiding principle of compassionate conservation (see also) is ""first do no harm,"" which means the life of each and every individual animal is valued. So, trading off individuals of one species for the good of individuals of another species, or of the same species, isn't acceptable. I also agree with retired marine biologist Bob Hees, who is quoted as saying, ""I've seen people try to mess with Mother Nature before, and it never works. It goes toward creating more problems."" The cormorant-salmon situation is a good catalyst for open discussions about creating a viable and practical conservation ethic based on compassion.There will be blood: Experimental killing sprees are wrong and likely won't work.Despite experts agreeing that killing the cormorants is wrong and won't work, it turns out that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is planning to kill nearly 11,000 cormorants and destroy more than 26,000 of their nests to try to reduce cormorant numbers by more than half. You can read the details in an essay by Alicia Graef called ""Plans Move Forward to Kill Thousands of Cormorants.""Ms. Graef also notes:Criticism [to the killing spree] was also brought by researchers from Oregon State University who were hired by the Army Corps to study the bird population on the island. They say the Army Corps ignored their findings and isn't using the best available science in its plan to protect young salmon. Killing one species to save another is a rather common occurrence and I also wrote about this heinous practice in an essay called ""Killing Barred Owls to Save Spotted Owls? Let's Stop Bloody Conservation Practices."" In this piece, I wrote about an essay in the magazine Conservation by science writer Warren Cornwall called ""There Will Be Blood,"" and noted that it is a must read for anyone interested in keeping up with current discussions and debates about the supposed need to kill animals of one species to save those of another species. The question at hand in Mr. Cornwall's excellent essay is, ""Should barred owls be killed to save endangered spotted owls?"" Spotted owls are shy birds who favor ancient forests that are disappearing due to logging in the northwestern United States, and they are threatened by larger and more aggressive barred owls who have migrated west from their original homes on the east coast of the United States.Killing one species to save another isn't a ""sad good,"" it's wrong.At the beginning of his piece Mr. Cornwall writes, ""The pressure to reach for a gun to help save one animal from another is stronger than ever. And it has triggered a conservation problem from hell."" He's right. I argued against killing the barred owls and against the position of ethicist, Bill Lynn. Dr. Lynn was hired by the Fish and Wildlife Service, and was initially skeptical about the above killing experiments, however, he changed his mind. He concluded that it was all right to kill the barred owls as an experiment if it was done as humanely as possible, and called it a ""sad good."" For me, a ""sad good"" is a very slippery slope that sets a lamentable precedent for opening the door for the more widespread ""experimental killing"" of barred owls and other species. Dr. Lynn balked on supporting a region-wide war on barred owls, and, experts protested any killing because they were convinced it simply wouldn't work. The killing of the cormorants is really a murderous experiment, and is wrong and likely won't work. Even if it did ""work,"" whatever that means, according to Ms. Graef:The Audubon Society of Portland announced its Board of Directors has voted to sue both the Army Corps and the FWS if permits are granted. Bob Sallinger, the organization's conservation director, said in a statement (link is external): Please do all you can to stop this unnecessary slaughter.This post originally appeared on Psychology Today.

It is poignant for me that I will be spending the last three days of Women's History Month with the modern-day Dorothea Dix, Elyn Saks of the USC Gould School of Law. We will be immersed in collaboration and study at the Saks Institute for Mental Health Law, Policy and Ethics, where Elyn is changing history and shattering expectations with her life and work.These two shining stars carry on a tradition of advocacy that unites them across the centuries. When I stop and think about this incredible legacy, it draws my attention and awareness to how many modern day female leaders have revolutionized the holistic health of women and have had a direct effect on my own life.I get asked all the time, 'With your mental health history, what is your current treatment and diagnosis?"" I have written before about my history with brain health challenges, with diagnoses given to me when I was young that are usually considered chronic. But my history has not become my reality, so I like to turn that question around and ask, ""Do I have a brain that functions 'normally'? No, I say, but does anyone?'Finding my way to that perspective owes so much to modern medicine when I was in my teens and a remarkable litany of teachers, healers, and revolutionary leaders. Their work changed my DNA, my health history, and my whole life trajectory. For Women's History Month, I want to publicly honor them for their radical work in bringing Flawless health to the world:  Debbie Rosas The final leg of my journey in ending my challenges with anorexia came through the intensive Nia White Belt training with Debbie Rosas. I learned how to tune in to sensation in my body at a cellular level, to stop thinking ""no pain no gain."" I accepted that there is truly no gain if there is no self compassion, which set the foundation for my studies a few months later with the revolutionary change maker Regena Thomashauer.Regena Thomashauer Regena contributes to changing the paradigm of health by teaching women how to express all their emotions, shed self-hatred and doubt, and live healthy, happy lives in every area -- work, family, spirituality, physical health, and emotional wellbeing.I have been studying with Regena for about a decade. She has taught me how to create a life-based on authentic expression of emotions and pleasure -- and to understand that there is a direct correlation between the light and the dark in our lives. The tools in her toolkit are powerful antidotes to women's lives today, which are so often a breeding ground for depression, anxiety, eating disorders, and general discontent.Barbara Stanny Barbara specializes in financial education for women. From her body of work, I have learned how to stand for my value, which has completely revolutionized my relationship with money. As a result of clarity about my work and finances, abundance flows to me in all areas of my life.  Christiane Northrup, M.D. In Regena's Mastery course, we had the incredibly lucky experience to study with Dr. Northrup, a pioneer in women's health who specializes in women over 40. Her work has been very informative and healing for me during this time of intense change in my body -- after 45 where I have seen shifts in my anxiety levels, insomnia, and patterns of weight gain. I have been able to rise to these body image and health challenges with the support of Christiane's brilliant work. Off the Mat Into the World  In this yoga leadership training, Hala Khouri, Seane Corn, and Suzanne Sterling use music, ritual, yoga, somatic therapy and thoughtful study to achieve an almost unimaginable release of trauma and grief. I cried in this training to the point where I was almost hyperventilating, but it was so healing -- soul cleansing and very important for changing patterns that no longer serve me. I experienced extreme mental health challenges as a young adult, some of them life-threatening. Even after many hospitalizations and years of treatment, I had some surprising regression in my 30s. Now, at least every day, I stop and feel a moment of gratitude for these women and their work as I celebrate the radical transformation in my life from studying with them. They changed my history and they are changing the world for the rest of us. This is a powerful sisterhood that I hope every women reading this will join to carry on a legacy of hope for all women everywhere as we model holistic health for our daughters, our girls... our future.---------If you're struggling with an eating disorder, call the National Eating Disorder Association hotline at 1-800-931-2237."

He travels often, but this is one of the very few times that he has been very impressed with a new country. In almost every phone call he was saying, ""You should see Singapore."" Our brief conversations made me really curious and I wanted to learn what amazed him about this tiny country. While I was doing a little research, last Monday we woke up to the news of the death of Lee Kuan Yew, a founder of Singapore who transformed a small port city into a wealthy global hub.Singapore -- what Lee Kuan Yew called a ""First World oasis in a Third World region"" -- is one of Asia's wealthiest and least corrupt countries, and obviously it won't be the same without him. The country is just like its late leader: productive, sober, incorrupt, innovative, progressive and pragmatic. Singapore has become an economic force, with one of the world's highest per capita incomes and high-quality schools, health care and public services thanks to Lee's extraordinary work.In a 2007 New York Times interview, Lee said, ""To understand Singapore and why it is what it is, you've got to start off with the fact that it's not supposed to exist and cannot exist."" He took over Singapore -- a fractured mix of Chinese, Malays and Indians with no common culture and language as well as almost no natural resources -- and turned it into an admired international business and financial center in three decades.On the other hand, the governing philosophy of Lee Kuan Yew -- such as a belief that an empowered free market required a strong central government at the expense of personal freedoms -- was criticized. His national self-improvement campaigns urged people to smile, speak good English and flush the toilet, and be spontaneously kind. Also, chewing gum, feeding birds, throwing garbage off balconies and spitting are crimes even today according to Singapore's legal code. For example, anyone caught spitting in public in Singapore can be hit with a hefty fine of up between $1,000 and $5,000.In his memoirs ""From Third World to First: The Singapore Story -- 1965-2000,"" he responded to those criticisms: ""We would have been a grosser, ruder, cruder society had we not made these efforts."" He also explained that making people ""change their habits so that they behaved more like first-world citizens, not like third-world citizens spitting and littering all over the place"" was more challenging than building up infrastructure.I think many of us who know a little bit about Turkey or any Third World country can easily relate to what he says. After I read him, I realized one more time why the ""New Turkey"" plan can't succeed. If you look at the recent picture of Turkey you can easily find many similarities with Singapore. Yes, Turkey has had fascinating infrastructural changes. It has done very well economically and has had a very well-established health care system for the last 10 years. And yes, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan is an autocrat the way Lee was. He has stamped down on many things, including smoking. However, Lee was ideology-free and did whatever was needed to ensure his country's survival for its people's sake, but today we know that Erdoğan has been using the damaged democracy of his country to transform it into an Islamist state.So, while Lee was aiming to build a civilized society, Erdoğan aims to raise ""pious children."" Nevertheless, apparently he doesn't know good ethics should come first before raising pious youths. He can't be a good role model while scolding people on the street and intimidating the women of the country. For example, even while praising motherhood, he vigorously insulted mothers who criticized him, such as Gülsüm Elvan, Berkin Elvan's mother. Also, it is now obvious that he hasn't done well with corruption at all, while Lee was able to create a very incorrupt country.Differently, Lee was sincere about raising the quality of life of every Singaporean. So, even though he was criticized for his iron grip on power, he was loved and respected by his people and people around the world. UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon expressed his ""sadness"" at news of his death. US President Barack Obama described him as ""a true giant of history"" and the Chinese Foreign Ministry called him a ""uniquely influential statesman in Asia.""Moreover, there is a crucial difference between Lee's worldview and Erdoğan's vision. While Lee acknowledged that we are all global beings and our survivals depend upon world conditions, Erdoğan prefers to stick with ""precious loneliness"" to be able to hide unjust treatment and to hide revelations of corruption.Meanwhile, last week, while witnessing an ugly fight and accusations of corruption traded between Deputy Prime Minister Bülent Arınç and Ankara Mayor Melih Gökçek, I thought that if the fight had taken place in a developed and civilized country, those politicians would have resigned promptly. ""If we are not connected to this modern world, we are dead,"" Lee Kuan Yew once said, and it made me think that we are witnessing the inexorable death of the ""New Turkey.""For more Arzu Kaya-Uranli You can follow Arzu Kaya-Uranli in Twitter @akuranli"

Great and familiar cast, excellent script, superb production values and the direction is tight as a drum. Can't say this is the best film of the franchise, because so many of them have been excellent. But it's easily the most daring. Fasten your seat belts and test the airbags. This one accelerates real fast. (Photo courtesy of Universal Pictures) The cars from the action-thriller Fast & Furious 7.Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), a British black ops assassin, has a bug up his ass. Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew killed his brother and he is out for revenge. First stop is the office of CIA agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson), where Shaw and Hobbs get into a fight that leaves the hulky agent broken. Next, Shaw sends his blessings in the guise of a bomb to Dominic, his pal Brian (Paul Walker), his lady Mia (Jordana Brewster) and their kid. Kaboom!Dom seeks answers. A government operative (Kurt Russell) has a plan. If Dom and his ""family"" hunt down a beta device called a God's Eye, which is capable of tracking down anybody through aggregated surveillance cameras and audio feeds, even from cell phones, he'll let them use it to catch Shaw. Says the operative: ""It's like a tracking device on steroids."" Says its inventor, Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel): ""It uses every camera eye and audio device in this hemisphere."" And off they go, into battle. Dom and his crew and their vehicles head to the mountains of Eastern Europe, Japan, the Middle East and L.A. Director James Wan (Saw and The Conjuring) steps up to the camera along side cinematographers Marc Spicer and Stephen F. Windon (Fast & Furious 6) and displays an exceptional dexterity for car chases, fistfights and brawls. He uses a lot of close-ups, and that filmmaking strategy drags you into the characters, their actions and the movie. With the aid of editors Leigh Folsom Boyd, Dylan Highsmith, Kirk M. Morri and Christian Wagner, Wan assembles adrenalin-pumping footage that is near perfectly paced for 140 minutes. The action sequences are spellbinding. Cars jump out of planes, roll down mountains, are pummeled by missiles and skid through buildings. The car crew jumps out of moving trucks onto cars, drives super charged classic cars and evades gunshots. Punches are thrown, tire irons swung and machine guns are wielded around like toys. There is a precision to the proceedings that is astounding, invigorating and over-the top. Screenwriter Chris Morgan, who penned four previous chapters, knows the drill. Personal drama (there are some awkward sentimental moments that linger too long), romance (Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez rekindle the love story between Dom and Letty), intrigue, revenge, evil doings, retribution and the final fight and chase scenes. He doesn't let the characters evolve much, compared to the originally one conjured by Gary Scott Thompson back in 2001. He's more faithful to their personalities, relationships and group dynamics. There are millions of fans waiting for whiney Roman (Tyrese Gibson) to crack jokes and Tej (Ludacris) to have a tech solution for a problem, and Morgan doesn't disappoint. The direction, production elements and writing wouldn't mean a thing if the cast wasn't on their game, and they are. They've aged; fuller faces, softer muscles and maybe they've slowed down a step or two. Diesel is laconic, strong, the alpha. Johnson has his customary bravura. Rodriguez has that perfect blend of strong Latina and vulnerable woman. Statham is a worthy villain. Kurt Russell is a welcome addition. If you didn't know that Paul Walker had passed, you couldn't guess from what's on view that his acting, stand-ins, his brother and movie magic filled out his entire role in the movie. It's easy to see that this film is a homage to his spirit.This spring when you walk into your theater to see Furious 7, you will walk out thinking you just saw the first blockbuster event movie of the summer--only it isn't summer yet.Wanna go for a ride?Visit NNPA Syndication Film Critic Dwight Brown at DwightBrownInk.com."

27,RELIGION,Reflections from Rosebud Reservation,"Aamir Hussain, ContributorMuslim Interfaith Activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/reflections-from-rosebud-reservation_b_6963082.html,"This past week, I joined 11 other medical students from the University of Chicago in volunteering at a Lakota Native American reservation in South Dakota. The experience was a great opportunity to not only learn about health care challenges on reservations, but also to reflect on the intersections between religion, service, and medicine.",2015-03-31,2015-03-29-1427601904-6952559-11084269_10153183540366354_4064437161555290867_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-29-1427601904-6952559-11084269_10153183540366354_4064437161555290867_n-thumb.jpg,"This past week, I joined 11 other medical students from the University of Chicago in volunteering at a Lakota Native American reservation in Rosebud, South Dakota. We spent some of our time volunteering with Habitat for Humanity, and some time shadowing physicians at the local Indian Health Service (IHS) hospital. This experience was a great opportunity to not only learn about health care challenges on reservations, but also to reflect on the intersections between religion, service, and medicine. Aside from astronomically high rates of chronic conditions such as Type II Diabetes, obesity, depression, and alcoholism, patients at the IHS clinic often lack access to cancer screenings because the small facility does not have the resources to provide those services. As a result, it is not uncommon for treatable conditions to cause life-threatening complications. I was shocked to learn that some patients suffered from tuberculosis, a disease that I thought had been mostly eliminated from the United States. Finally, patients routinely resort to using the emergency room often need to be air-evacuated to other hospitals for minor complaints that cannot be addressed on the reservation. However, there were also several positive aspects of the IHS. First, The primary care doctors I shadowed were able to spend lots of time with her patients, talking through diagnoses and medications at length. Second, the reservation community was very close-knit, and physicians (even those who lived outside the reservation) were well-acquainted with Lakota traditions and had a strong desire to be part of the local culture. Finally, although the IHS is woefully under-funded (annual health spending per person for the overall U.S. population is over $9000, in comparison to about $2400 per person in the IHS), it is still a single-payer system that guarantees coverage to all Native Americans with documented membership in a federally-recognized tribe. Although IHS insurance may be less effective outside IHS facilities, this federal program ensures that virtually everyone on the reservation is insured.While learning about Lakota history, I was intrigued by the changing roles of religious groups over time. Until the mid-20th century, many Western churches saw the Native Americans as ""savages,"" and many priests sought to ""educate"" the Lakota in such a way that they would forget their old ways and completely adopt Western customs. Fortunately, there now seems to be more mutual understanding between different spiritual traditions. Christian institutions provide a large number of social services, and serve as community centers for various activities. Churches and religious leaders now run many charities, including the local chapter of Habitat for Humanity. However, many Lakota traditions such as sweat lodges, vision quests, and Sun Dances are also practiced, and some reservation residents observe Christianity alongside the traditional Lakota religion. Indeed, I was struck by the contrast between hopelessness and optimism on the reservation. On one hand, unemployment is well over 70 percent, the life expectancy can be less than 50 years, suicide rates are extremely high, and families are often trapped in cyclical poverty. On the other hand, reservation residents speak fondly of Sinte Gleska, an accredited Lakota university that provides a wide array of degrees, and cheer for their young students who have won full scholarships to major national universities like Stanford and Dartmouth. Others express hope for the in-progress Crazy Horse Memorial, and how it can someday stand as a symbol of the unvanquished Native American spirit for generations to come. Photo from the campus of Sinte Gleska University.Through my conversations with the people of Rosebud, I was constantly reminded of a verse from the Quran that speaks of resilience: ""Verily, with every difficulty there [comes] relief"" (Quran 94:6). Throughout my life as practicing Muslim, I always took this verse for granted; whenever I struggled with something, I found comfort in the fact that relief would eventually come. However, this past week has shown me that for many people, hardship can often be followed by an even greater hardship. Finding any ""relief"" can be very difficult, and it can be tough to persevere when faced with such overwhelming odds. I have been inspired by the various people I have met on this short trip, from the recent high school graduate who strives to learn at least ""one new fact"" every day and someday teach English abroad, to the tireless educator at Sinte Gleska University who motivates her students to follow their dreams, to the hospital worker who speaks fluent Lakota with local elders, keeping an ancient language alive. These friends I made, and many others, illustrate my religion's core tenets of humility, service, resilience, and community engagement. As a result, I have become more motivated to reflect on my own practice of Islam, and will strive to exhibit those virtues throughout my medical career.

We spent some of our time volunteering with Habitat for Humanity, and some time shadowing physicians at the local Indian Health Service (IHS) hospital. This experience was a great opportunity to not only learn about health care challenges on reservations, but also to reflect on the intersections between religion, service, and medicine. Aside from astronomically high rates of chronic conditions such as Type II Diabetes, obesity, depression, and alcoholism, patients at the IHS clinic often lack access to cancer screenings because the small facility does not have the resources to provide those services. As a result, it is not uncommon for treatable conditions to cause life-threatening complications. I was shocked to learn that some patients suffered from tuberculosis, a disease that I thought had been mostly eliminated from the United States. Finally, patients routinely resort to using the emergency room often need to be air-evacuated to other hospitals for minor complaints that cannot be addressed on the reservation. However, there were also several positive aspects of the IHS. First, The primary care doctors I shadowed were able to spend lots of time with her patients, talking through diagnoses and medications at length. Second, the reservation community was very close-knit, and physicians (even those who lived outside the reservation) were well-acquainted with Lakota traditions and had a strong desire to be part of the local culture. Finally, although the IHS is woefully under-funded (annual health spending per person for the overall U.S. population is over $9000, in comparison to about $2400 per person in the IHS), it is still a single-payer system that guarantees coverage to all Native Americans with documented membership in a federally-recognized tribe. Although IHS insurance may be less effective outside IHS facilities, this federal program ensures that virtually everyone on the reservation is insured.While learning about Lakota history, I was intrigued by the changing roles of religious groups over time. Until the mid-20th century, many Western churches saw the Native Americans as ""savages,"" and many priests sought to ""educate"" the Lakota in such a way that they would forget their old ways and completely adopt Western customs. Fortunately, there now seems to be more mutual understanding between different spiritual traditions. Christian institutions provide a large number of social services, and serve as community centers for various activities. Churches and religious leaders now run many charities, including the local chapter of Habitat for Humanity. However, many Lakota traditions such as sweat lodges, vision quests, and Sun Dances are also practiced, and some reservation residents observe Christianity alongside the traditional Lakota religion. Indeed, I was struck by the contrast between hopelessness and optimism on the reservation. On one hand, unemployment is well over 70 percent, the life expectancy can be less than 50 years, suicide rates are extremely high, and families are often trapped in cyclical poverty. On the other hand, reservation residents speak fondly of Sinte Gleska, an accredited Lakota university that provides a wide array of degrees, and cheer for their young students who have won full scholarships to major national universities like Stanford and Dartmouth. Others express hope for the in-progress Crazy Horse Memorial, and how it can someday stand as a symbol of the unvanquished Native American spirit for generations to come. Photo from the campus of Sinte Gleska University.Through my conversations with the people of Rosebud, I was constantly reminded of a verse from the Quran that speaks of resilience: ""Verily, with every difficulty there [comes] relief"" (Quran 94:6). Throughout my life as practicing Muslim, I always took this verse for granted; whenever I struggled with something, I found comfort in the fact that relief would eventually come. However, this past week has shown me that for many people, hardship can often be followed by an even greater hardship. Finding any ""relief"" can be very difficult, and it can be tough to persevere when faced with such overwhelming odds. I have been inspired by the various people I have met on this short trip, from the recent high school graduate who strives to learn at least ""one new fact"" every day and someday teach English abroad, to the tireless educator at Sinte Gleska University who motivates her students to follow their dreams, to the hospital worker who speaks fluent Lakota with local elders, keeping an ancient language alive. These friends I made, and many others, illustrate my religion's core tenets of humility, service, resilience, and community engagement. As a result, I have become more motivated to reflect on my own practice of Islam, and will strive to exhibit those virtues throughout my medical career. Before we left to return to Chicago, our Rosebud host told us, ""It doesn't matter if you never return here. Just promise me this: never forget us, and never forget what you learned here.""

Adiós to the seasoned pros, and hello to a constant slew of fresh faces. Every moment I focus my eyes, unplug my ears and zip my lips, I recognize the flood of anxious faces; I sense their piercing thirst; and I resist the urge to comment on their eagerness to enter the fashion industry expecting to become the next top fiercest ""this person,"" or ""that person's"" biggest, baddest -- yes you've guessed it --- MODEL.The overpopulation of models in our second decade of the 21st century would have been unimaginable to the fashion industry during the '60s, '70s, '80s, and even the '90s of the 20th century. In the earlier years, professional fashion models (especially those of color) were a rarity, and regulation was ruled by a recognizable system of reverence and respect. Now there is an overflow of Naomi Campbells and Kate Mosses with EVERYBODY seemingly motivated by no less than reality TV and ubiquitous smartphone apps for social media. [Photo: PAUL MASSEY / Rex USA / Courtesy Everett Collection (l-r) Linda Evangelista, Cindy Crawford, Naomi Campbell, and Christy Turlington walk for Versace Autumn/ Winter Fashion show Milan, 1991.]With the rise in reality TV shows such as Tyra Banks' America's Next Top Model and social media platforms such as Instagram adding the most fuel to the fire, the fashion industry is barfing bitterness at the excess of anxious, self-taught hopefuls flooding the market. What our beloved model wannabes haven't taught themselves is that there is far more to becoming a reputable model than being the cutest in your school, mauling a photographer to snap you in your favorite #OOTD (outfits of the day) and entangling yourself in an endless surge of social media hype; these aren't even close to the basics. Modeling is known as an art, a craft -- a craft where the model is comparable to pure clay, or even children's Play-Doh. Comparable to clay, a model's inner beauty should be molded, developed and preserved, in order to showcase natural attributes and qualities rather than drowning his/her beloved followers with selfie's, shameless self-promotion, and hashtags as high as heaven. But that's not what our ""20k-follower"" page owners want to hear -- no!Excitingly, there's been an overall boost to the fashion industry with shows like Lifetime's Project Runway inspiring every needle and threading knitter to be the next Ralph Lauren or Alexander McQueen. Thank the Lord! This means an increase in runway jobs, showroom gigs, print ads and advertising campaigns -- Hallelujah! (Turns out not every fashion-related reality TV show is a detriment to the industry, after all.) But, is it enough to sustain and bring a balance to our industry? And you would think, wouldn't our industry want more objects of color, beauty and distinction piercing its dark, bumbling world? Yes, I do, but if there aren't an equivalent amount of ""professional"" outlets for us to succeed, it simply compares to an unemployment rate. Edward Enninful, British fashion stylist and current fashion and style director of W Magazine, recently launched an Instagram modeling contest, promising some lucky winner an official shoot for W Magazine. ""I'm looking to discover a new-face model on Instagram"", Enninful declared using his Instagram page (@edward_enninful), pounding in over 25,000 entries with his special hashtag #EdwinEnninfulScouts. It made me wonder, has the fashion world begun to decline against its own will, forced to embrace the new schemes of these social and digital platforms? Or are they merely outsourcing the casting process to a budding new generation of time-saving technology?Before I could sit here and rant like a modeling industry know-it-all, I asked Devyn Abdullah, a N.Y.C.-based fashion model, and season one winner of Naomi Campbell's The Face, her views:I feel as if the internet, media, and definitely reality TV changed modeling... It was a rare world, and now can't be replaced. There's never ever going to be another Naomi Campbell, there's never ever gonna' be another trinity group. Those women [Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington and Naomi Campbell] can book any job.  [Photo: Fabio Iona / Indigitalimages.com. Model Devyn Abdullah walks for Pamella Roland SS14 during Mercedes-Benz New York Fashion Week]A world of Catch-22s -- there are tons of working, experienced models now entering the reality TV world to boost their careers, such as The Real Housewives of Atlanta's Cynthia Bailey, a former supermodel-turned-reality-star, while others have used their reality TV credentials to launch top-notch modeling careers, such as Keeping Up With The Kardasian's Kylie Jenner, a former reality-TV star and soon-to-be supermodel. But as for Devyn, this reality show winner feels as if press, media and television endeavors are overly publicizing the secrecy that built this fashion industry, thus downgrading ""modeling"" from an actual career option to merely just an amusement. Working with Naomi Campbell on a reality TV show may be a dream for some, but ultimately, the saturation is causing this industry to crash, lose its value, and become a playground for all.The Meredith Vieira ShowLavishing upon quotes, next comes the beloved, supermodel herself, Naomi Campbell when she appeared on NBC's The Meredith Vieira Show. Her statement followed host Meredith Vieira's questioning of the new wave of ""insta-girls"" -- girls who instantly become top models by using Instagram as a platform- in comparison to Naomi's more traditional start over 25 years ago.It's amazing, I mean good luck to them, I just feel my generation of women, like Cindy Crawford, Linda Evangelista, Christy Turlington, Claudia [Schiffer] we had to earn our stripes and take our stepping-stones to get to where we have gotten to accomplish what we have achieved to this date. Naomi then continued,I kind of feel like, 'My God,' it's like we've worked so hard and we are still working at it. Then it just comes like that for them, but I sometimes believe, easy come, easy go. So, I am actually grateful for the way that I had my career. I wouldn't want it any other way, so that's for them, this is [for] me. What if Naomi Campbell would have made her debut in 2006, when shows like America's Next Top Model and websites like ModelMayhem and Myspace began making their impact on the modeling industry, as opposed to 1986, when she graced the covers of Elle and Vogue magazines? Her household name would be unheard of and the beauty and distinction that highlighted her rise to the top, well, would have clearly been over-looked. Is there hope for the art and business of modeling?Perhaps the establishment of a legitimate fashion industry union, equivalent to the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) will be the dawn of a new professional era for modeling -- qualified models would gain professional status only after booking a set number of high-end jobs or gaining representation with a legitimate agency. Yet, by the time a retired Fashion executive has the time to initiate and put into place this genius idea, our pro models could be at a sad booking rate of one job per year. Their money would be used up from auditioning for reality shows and such, the only way it seems a ""working model"" gets press these days.Couldn't this be a marvelous post-white-house initiative for our ever so fabulous first lady? I couldn't imagine the fashionable Michelle Obama allowing our industry to suffer and remain imbalanced after the impact of her White House Fashion Education Workshop. With all of the influence that she's garnered within the fashion industry, can the political world save the modeling world? Can a life-changing new wave of fashion legislation be enough to flush away every grey area plaguing the modeling industry's accreditation system?One thing's for sure, the modeling industry is crashing, and quickly losing its value.This article was originally published on The Triumphant Scoop."
30,IMPACT,The State of Masculinity in America and the One Film Every Man Must See,"Cari E. Guittard, ContributorPrincipal, Global Engagement Partners; Professor of Global Man...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-state-of-masculinity-_b_6959478.html,,2015-03-31,2015-03-28-1427505279-2170429-themaskyoulivein.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-03-28-1427505279-2170429-themaskyoulivein-thumb.jpg,"This week I had the great privilege of attending a screening of Jennifer Siebel Newsom's latest film, The Mask You Live In, which embarks on a powerful exploration of the truth and consequences associated with modern masculinity in America. If you are unaware of this remarkable filmmaker, make note, as she is on course to becoming one of the great filmmakers of our time. This film is the second in a trilogy series that Siebel Newsom and her team have embarked upon. Her first film the groundbreaking Missrepresentation, widely acclaimed at Sundance, sparked a global education and empowerment conversation on the impact of pervasive media stereotypes and distorted messaging that negatively impacts the development of girls and young women. Both films are harrowing documentaries that artfully intertwine expert commentary layered with thoughtful images and deeply personal narratives, in what is becoming Siebel Newsom's signature style. In peeling back the layers of what brings us to the current state of masculinity in America, Mask begins with the pain so many young boys and men experience and carry in isolation starting very early on in life. Legendary coach and author Joe Ehrmann's story and unmistakable voice fill the opening scenes with an all too familiar narrative of his five year old self being told by his father, ""Don't cry, be a man."" One of the most damaging phrases in our culture and yet an all too common socialization tool that is inflicted upon generation after generation of young men. The story then details Joe's journey and numerous others from every race and ethnic background dealing with similar boyhood experiences of shame, fear, isolation and shunted emotions. ""He wears a mask, and his face grows to fit it."" --  George OrwellThe systemic internalization and blocking off of all emotion as the film warns inevitably leads to pent up frustration, anger and oftentimes violence against oneself and others. The stats Mask weaves in throughout are shocking and detail the dramatic rise in the just the past few years in bullying, rape, murder, and in particular mass murder by young men should be warning enough that we as a society aren't doing enough. As a society we are failing our boys and young men.And though there are so many elements of this film that haunt you, there is much hope weaved throughout that Siebel Newsom deftly uncovers and brings home by showcasing the amazing efforts of extraordinary teachers and mentors who work with the kids everyone has given up on. They are some of the most remarkable human beings I have ever witnessed captured on film. They are providing safe spaces, camaraderie and the tools to help adolescent men not only share their emotions but a safe space to connect with one another, a brotherhood of sorts that will shape them in a positive way for the rest of their lives. When I look at the amount of money we in America spend on our prisons compared to programs like this I wonder where the hell are our priorities? We should be embracing, elevating and compensating extraordinary local leaders like these teaches and mentors Siebel Newsom highlights so they not only never stop what they are doing but so that their efforts can be replicated and scaled in every city across America. We need an army of these teachers, mentors and coaches engaged in a massive collective effort if we are ever to right this ship. Where We Take The Conversation From HereWhen I asked men who attended the screening what their main takeaways were and if anything surprised them, they universally said that while they weren't surprised by what they saw the real revelation was in the new awareness they now have that this is something that needs to be surfaced and talked about. Men don't talk about these issues and as a society we've looked the other way. That has to stop. This film is the perfect way to initiate the conversation in your home, community, and workplace. The Mask You Live In is the first comprehensive film study on the state of masculinity in America. It is a film every young man and grown man, everywhere, must see. Especially if they are fathers, coaches, teaches, and mentors. This film, like Missrepresentaion, makes you think for days and weeks thereafter. They are stark warnings that compel the audience to look inward, have a conversation and then be part of the solution in whatever way you can. You are compelled to action. And when I say compel, I mean anyone who watches either of these films cannot walk away unchanged. And for that I am personally grateful and hope Seibel Newsome and the The Representation Project never stop what they are doing. What You Can Do Now Join & Support the Movement -- Learn more at TheRepresentationProject.org; Sign up to receive updates, insights and new learnings. Host a Screening -- in your home, community, and/or workplace and start the conversation Read and Buy Extra Copies of Joe Ehrmann's brilliant book, Inside Out Coaching, and give one to every young man, father, coach, and teacher that matters in your life."

(Photo by Hector Vivas/LatinContent/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc148852400003600382ac9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"MEXICO CITY -- The news went viral on social networks, while the main print and electronic media trumpeted it on front pages and in prime time as a brilliant coup for bolstering Mexico's international image: James Bond, the super-macho, all-terrain star of the spy world, had descended on Mexico City for two weeks in the midst of staged Day of the Dead festivities.The government hailed the filming of the opening sequence of ""Spectre,"" which is primed to be the 26th Bond blockbuster, on locations in and around the Zocalo, the historical center of Aztec Tenochtitlan, in colonial Mexico City and the present-day capital. The set is a quick skip from the Great Temple, where, in pre-Hispanic times, high priests gouged out the hearts of victims stretched over a sacrificial stone and displayed the severed heads of war captives on a massive wooden skull rack that resembled an abacus.The government of Mexico desperately seeks good publicity these days. The lengths it is willing to go for that were revealed by the website Tax Analysts in March, drawing on internal Sony documents hacked and made public by an unidentified organization possibly linked to the North Korean government: Mexican businessmen and officials offered Sony and MGM millions of dollars in in financial incentives and possible tax rebates to portray the country in a favorable light.Among ""elements needed to preserve the Mexican deal"" listed in the leaked memo was the inclusion of a recognizable Mexican actress. Stephanie Sigman, star of ""Miss Bala,"" a 2011 thriller about an aspiring beauty queen kidnapped by drug traffickers who is forced to work as a mule, was cast in a small part.The irony of casting an actress whose image is so tied to the ongoing Mexican tragedy may be lost on international audiences, but not on Mexicans. According to a UN report, 63 percent of women in Mexico have suffered violence at the hands of men. Femicides are on the rise with six women murdered every day, according to the National Citizen Femicide Observatory. Among Latin American nations, Mexico leads in the number of disappeared women forced into sexual slavery. The government's requirement to film at least four minutes of the film in Mexico City was satisfied by the opening scene, with Bond ""taking off into the Mexican skyline"" in a helicopter. The portrayal of Mexican police was to be favorable, according to the hacked documents  -- the opposite of the reality exposed by President Enrique Peña Nieto himself when he called for disbanding police forces possibly infiltrated by organized crime in 1,800 municipalities throughout Mexico, beginning in Guerrero, Jalisco, Michoacán and Tamaulipas, states that lead the country in extreme violence.Why should projecting a distorted and unrealistic image of Mexico in a Bond film matter so much to officials in a country where everyone knows the reality: that this is a country where 43 rural teacher's college students disappeared half a year ago, into a vast archipelago of the dead, where myriad clandestine graves yield remains that are never identified?Since taking office in December 2012, one of President Enrique Peña Nieto's stated aims has been to reposition the image of Mexico abroad, which has been sullied by years of drug war violence that has left more than 100,000 dead and nearly 26,000 missing since 2006. He aims to boost international tourism, a goal that has become more urgent with the fall of oil prices by nearly half since last June, which cut revenue and jeopardized foreign investment in the country's oil industry. The incentive package for the Bond film is believed to be as high as $20 million. This was obviously considered a fair amount for product placement of ""Brand Mexico"" in a movie that may be seen by billions. ""Spectre"" will be released worldwide Nov. 6, days after genuine Day of the Dead ceremonies in Mexico.While bogus Bond violence was being filmed, thousands marched in Mexico City on the six month anniversary of the students' disappearance in Guerrero. Some of the families have been touring the United States to garner support for demands for justice and to emphasize their rejection of the government's official story, which is largely based on an unverifiable match of one tiny bony fragment to one missing student's DNA. Filming the latest James Bond movie ""Spectre"" in downtown Mexico City on March 25, 2015 in Mexico City, Mexico. (Photo by Hector Vivas/LatinContent/Getty Images)Mexico is not a failed state, but several of the country's 31 states are failed. Guerrero, with the highest homicide rate in the country, is the epicenter of institutional collapse where a dangerous mix of drug trafficking and poverty is larded with pervasive official corruption. In the village of Nuevo Balsas, in the rugged Guerrero mountains, marijuana and opium poppies used to be the main source of income. Since the Canadian company Torex opened the Media Luna gold mine a few years ago, there have been jobs but worse trouble. Kidnappings and extortion have increased, and security is in the hands of community police. As a lawyer in the town of 1,500 residents said, ""There's more money and we're a blank check for the mafias. If you don't pay up, they kill you.""Since the media have begun to reflect the rising popular anger over corruption, violence and impunity, they too are at risk and freedom of the press is deteriorating. Among the latest irritants is the firing of Carmen Aristegui, Mexico's most popular broadcast journalist, who last November broke the story of ""The White House,"" a sprawling mansion in the capital's most exclusive neighborhood built for the president's wife, former soap opera star Angelica Rivera, by a company that has received juicy contracts from the government. It is widely believed that she lost her job at the behest of the presidency. While prestigious journalists are usually protected by their high visibility, the human rights organization Article 19 has documented 656 attacks against journalists since Peña Nieto took office, including more than half a dozen unsolved murders in 2014. On Reporters Without Borders' 2014 World Press Freedom Index, Mexico is 152 out of 180 countries, between the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Iraq.The latest blow to ""Brand Mexico"" is a scathing United Nations report accusing police and security forces of practicing widespread torture. ""Police and soldiers have regularly turned to torture to punish or extract false confessions or information from detainees in its so-called War on Drugs,"" the report says. ""Frequently, victims are forced to sign declarations under torture and in many cases are convicted solely on the basis of those statements.""Crew preparing the scenery for filming the latest James Bond movie ""Spectre"" at downtown streets of Mexico City on March 23, 2015 in Mexico City, Mexico. (Photo by Hector Vivas/LatinContent/Getty Images)Two recent presidential appointments are also troubling the public. Mexico's new attorney general, Arely Gomez, is the sister of a top official at Televisa, Latin America's largest media company and a key factor in Peña Nieto's electoral triumph. Gomez replaces Jesus Murillo Karam, whose credibility plummeted after he declared ""Enough, I'm tired,"" abruptly ending the Nov. 7 news conference where he had just given the official version of what happened to the 43 missing students: how they had been handed over by police to members of a drug gang, who incinerated their bodies at a garbage dump, pulverized the remains, packed them in plastic bags and threw them in a nearby river. On Jan. 27, Murillo Karam stated categorically that this is the ""historical truth."" After taking office, Gomez was quick to give her position on the affair of the missing students, calling it an ""isolated case.""In yet another bad sign, Eduardo Medina Mora, the former Mexican ambassador to the United States and previously to the United Kingdom, following his tenure as attorney general under President Felipe Calderon, has now taken office for 15 years as a supreme court justice, despite never having served as a judge. As attorney general he midwifed Calderon's disastrous and tragic ""War on Drugs."" He is widely suspected of having authorized Operation Fast and Furious, a failed program run by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that enabled Mexican drug cartels to get their hands on high-powered weapons, although he denies any involvement. As secretary of public safety under President Vicente Fox, his responsibility for human rights violations during operations by federal police in the repression of residents of Atenco, in the state of Mexico (governed at the time by Peña Nieto) -- whose protest against a new Mexico City airport left two dead and a number of women accusing the police of sexual abuse -- has repeatedly been called into question.The hope these days is that Mexicans fed up with corruption and impunity will not accommodate political business as usual. Midterm elections will be held in Mexico on June 7 for nine governors, all 500 seats in the lower house of the national legislature and other influential positions. Throughout Mexico, but especially in Guerrero, there are calls for boycotting the elections. So while James Bond is cavorting in downtown Mexico City among giant skeleton props, leaping over rooftops and jumping into helicopters in an fictional exercise the government hopes will bolster ""Brand Mexico,"" Mexicans all over the country are clamoring for a new deal and real justice."
