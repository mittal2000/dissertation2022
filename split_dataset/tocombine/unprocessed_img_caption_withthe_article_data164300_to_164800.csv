0,PARENTING,"I Wouldn't Let My Son Play Football, Either","Lisa Belkin, Contributor
Senior Columnist, The Huffington Post",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/football-injuries-kids_us_5b9cc938e4b03a1dcc81d525,"A sport that rattles children's brains is probably not a sport that our children should be playing. At least not with current rules, equipment and win-at-all-cost attitudes.",2013-02-04,"9 Dec 1998: General view of players from Rancho Penasquitos, California looking on during the Pop Warner Pee Wee Football Super Bowl at Disney Wide World of Sports Complex in Orlando, Florida. Mandatory Credit: Scott Halleran /Allsport",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cc9381f00002c00215ca8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Watching the Ravens and 49ers knock helmets yesterday I thought back to an article I wrote two years ago about parents and the dangers of football. A college player had killed himself, and an autopsy found years of post concussive damage that might have led to depression and, in turn, his suicide. Will this lead parents to start pulling their sons off football teams, I wondered? At the time I concluded that not enough was known to make that a logical response. Of course, I conceded, few of our parenting responses are logical. Humans repeatedly show themselves to be spectacularly poor judges of risk, and parents seem even less adept. We refuse to let junior walk to school, even though the odds of him being kidnapped is minuscule, particularly compared to the very real risk of a crash while driving the same route, or that of diabetes and obesity from never walking anywhere at all. So, at the time, I cautioned that pulling our children out of a sport because of what seemed a remote possibility of long-term injury was probably an over-reaction. I don't feel that way anymore. I've changed my mind mostly because we have more data. Like the report last fall from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finding a nearly four-fold increase in Alzheimer's and Lou Gehrig's disease upon autopsy of former NFL players. Like the work being done at Boston University, finding evidence of CTE, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy, on nearly every autopsied football player's brain, including the teenagers in the group. Or the nearly 3,400 lawsuits filed by former players or their surviving relatives, accusing the NFL of knowing of the dangers but not mitigating, or even publicly acknowledging, them. Or the now infamous Pee Wee game in Southbridge, MA, during which five children. some as young as 10, suffered concussions. As a result, parents are starting to rethink the sport. The website VOXXI reported last month that ""more and more moms and dads, or players, are deciding against playing football with recent participation numbers revealing a 15 to 20 percent decrease."" President Barack Obama is apparently among those with second thoughts, telling The New Republic ""I'm a big football fan, but I have to tell you if I had a son, I'd have to think long and hard before I let him play football."" So would I. True, they are too old for Pee Wee ball now (and were never really interested in the sport) so for me the point is theoretical. Still, in the risk/benefit equation that is parenting, this choice is becoming one of the easy ones. A sport that rattles children's brains is probably not a sport that our children should be playing. At least not with current rules, equipment and win-at-all-cost attitudes. The risk of lifelong damage is too high. Where two years ago I wondered if parents were being a tad over-protective in taking their children off the field, today I wonder whether they are being reckless in allowing them to don pads and helmets and head out there in the first place. Much safer to let them walk to school alone. Good exercise, too."

""The positive from all of this is that there are now no known ailments left for me to try,"" Morrissey said in a statement. Barrett's esophagus is a common condition among people who also suffer from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is when acid is regurgitated back into the esophagus from the stomach, the Mayo Clinic reported. Barrett's esophagus occurs when that regurgitated acid damages the esophageal lining, making the esophageal lining look like the stomach's lining, according to the National Institutes of Health. While the risk is small, Barrett's esophagus is known to raise the likelihood of a person developing esophageal cancer. However, the Mayo Clinic emphasized that most people with the condition will not go on to develop esophageal cancer, especially if there is no dysplasia (early signs of cancerous changes in the esophagus) present. Symptoms of Barrett's esophagus include vomiting, extreme heartburn, problems swallowing, and blood in stools or in vomit, according to Wexner Medical Center at Ohio State University. The condition is officially diagnosed with endoscopy (when a tube is inserted into the esophagus to retrieve a tissue sample).There is no cure for Barrett's esophagus, but there are treatments a person can undergo to keep the condition from getting worse, Wexner Medical Center reported. Such treatments include drugs, surgery to remove the damaged part of the esophagus, and dilation (to open up the esophagus). "
2,STYLE & BEAUTY,How Privilege Influences Our Perceptions of Style,"Sally McGraw, Contributor
Freelance writer, blogger and communications professional; Alr...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thin-age-beauty-privilege_us_5b9cc8a0e4b03a1dcc81d0c8,"I cannot deny that thin women seem able to ""get away"" with more than non-thin women, especially when it comes to style choices.",2013-02-04,"NEW YORK, NY - JANUARY 09: Lena Dunham attends the premiere of 'Girls' Season 2 hosted by HBO at NYU Skirball Center on January 9, 2013 in New York City. (Photo by Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cc8a024000032005355a5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A while back, Kasmira posted about a What Not to Wear contestant who was called out for her offbeat, off-kilter dressing style. She generated a great discussion about quirky dressing, body size, grooming and other factors that figure into how women are judged on their appearances. Image courtesy Glamour, Getty Images.And then Lena Dunham wore an extremely short dress with hotpants, and got an earful from the press for her bad fashion sense, to which she responded, ""I don't think a girl with tiny thighs would have received such no-pants attention. I think that it really was... 'Why did you make us look at your thighs?' My response is, get used to it because I am going to live to be 100, and I am going to show my thighs every day till I die.""And it got me thinking about how appearance-related privilege figures into fashion. I thought about it for a long time and am still sorting through my thoughts a bit, but feel like I can at least get the conversational ball rolling.Thin privilege is a touchy subject. In my opinion, it cuts both ways: Thin women are often assumed to be healthy, perceived to be beautiful and afforded the luxury of approval and attention from both sexes. That can be fantastic, it can be oppressive, it can be confusing, and I'm sure it can be countless other things that I cannot even imagine. I have no wish to demonize thin women merely for being thin. Let me be very clear: To do so would be just as prejudiced and unfair as demonizing fat women merely for being fat.Nevertheless, I cannot deny that thin women seem able to ""get away"" with more than non-thin women, especially when it comes to style choices. Look on Pinterest, street-style blogs, even mainstream fashion magazine editorials. You'll see that the vast majority of women photographed and showcased are very tall and very thin. Find an outfit that seems outlandish or very revealing to your eye, and then imagine it on a larger figure. On a thin woman, such choices seem edgy, quirky or sexy. On a non-thin woman, such choices are often deemed garish, ill-advised, even appalling.Beauty privilege and youth privilege often go hand-in-hand with thin privilege, and also influence how some people react to style choices. Pinterest's fashion offerings are rife with examples of beauty and youth privilege, especially when it comes to dressing simply. Loads of young, gorgeous women wearing incredibly simple, barely accessorized outfits comprised of basic pieces get pinned, repinned and repinned ad infinitum. Pretty young celebs are photographed wearing the simplest of ensembles and lauded for their innovative style choices. And they look good! They do! But I feel like folks are potentially seeing youth and beauty instead of innovation, inspiration or creativity. A white tee, jeans and black heels might look marvelous on a gorgeous 22-year-old woman... but is it really such a compelling and inspiring combination that you need to file it away for future reference? If the same combination was shown on a plain-looking 48-year-old woman, would it receive the same outpouring of enthusiasm?And yes, some of this is down to dressing to your figure, regardless of size, age, or socially sanctioned attractiveness. All figures can be flattered, all figures can be adorned in graceful and appealing ways, and there are garments and styles that work better on certain figures and sets of proportions than they do on others. Would I have advised Lena Dunham to wear a loose, short dress, hotpants and flats? No, because the outfit doesn't work well on her specific frame. Do I think she looks inexcusably awful? No, I think she looks like she pulled together an outfit that felt breezy and fun and wasn't fussed about traditional figure flattery that day. Do I think that Alexa Chung would've received the same deluge of hate if she'd worn this exact same outfit? No, I think she would've be re-crowned the Reigning Queen of Stylish Quirk.I feel like sometimes we cannot separate the clothes from the woman. We see a beautiful, young, thin woman and label her as stylish without really considering if she has made unusual or interesting fashion choices. We see a non-beautiful, non-young, non-thin woman and -- because we are conditioned to do so -- feel less inclined to label her as stylish unless she is very clearly making fashion choices that help her seem more beautiful, younger and thinner. Which makes it even more challenging for these women to push their boundaries, make alternate figure-flattering choices, or do anything that feels like a sartorial experiment. The risk of censure is very real.Again, I do not believe that all thin, young, beautiful women should be scorned or punished, and I'm well aware that LOADS of them are incredibly creative and stylish. (Including the aforementioned Alexa Chung, who, in my opinion, expresses truly creative personal style and has said some very astute and valid things about her own experiences being scrutinized for her thinness.) Additionally, I do not believe that all non-beautiful, non-young, non-thin women are inherently stylish. I've just noticed that the deck is stacked. And I'm glad that Lena will be showing her thighs until she's 100 because it will remind people that ALL women can make non-traditional style choices. And have fun with them.What's been your experience with thin, youth and beauty privilege in the realm of style? Do you feel the deck is stacked for or against you because of your age, shape, or beauty? Do you make non-traditional style choices yourself? What feedback do you get, if any? How do you respond?"

Not only to hear the great singing, but also to see what she would be wearing... I feel fortunate to have known ahead of time that it would be, up and coming designer, Rubin Singer. Kudos to Beyoncé for supporting an American brand and more importantly one that is lesser known. Rubin Singer is an emerging New York designer who launched his line just about the time I did. We have both steadily climbed the fashion ladder, circumventing the challenges that come with creating your own line. In 2008, I was privy to collaborate with Rubin on his Spring 2009 collection, by creating bags for his runway show.It was great fun and a super exciting experience. Since then, we have both had some great celebrities sporting our designs. For me, its been the fashionable Sarah Jessica Parker, Kate Bosworth and Kate Beckinsale to name a few and for Rubin it has been music greats including Fergie, Solange Knowles and superstar, Beyoncé. It is exciting to see how far we have both come and comforting to know that in a field where so many struggle to make it, we are both continuing to succeed. We clearly are both ""Crazy in Love"" with what we do and it is clear to see that the world is starting to take notice."

Though Sochi, which is better known in Russia as a warm weather destination for oligarchs than as a ski hub, has long been on the local tourist map, the Olympics will mark the city's international debut. As such, everything must be perfect.Early reports from the city made it sound as though locals would be victimized by the success of their Olympic bid: forced evictions began not long after the Games were announced. Moscow clearly never planned to embrace the town's shabby chic aspect.Now, as Sochi begins to welcome international competitors into its new stadiums -- the FIS Cross Country Skiing World Cup is underway near the ski resort of Rosa Khutor -- a new version of Sochi has emerged. In this iteration, Sochi is less focussed on the beach and more connected with the Caucasus. The mountains are thick with ski runs and gondolas. The views are punctuated not only by scenic villages, but by major construction sites.As with any other Olympic host city, Sochi is hoping that the Games will bring more than an economic boost. Sochi wants to be an international destination for European and Asian elites. Organizers would have the city's name be synonymous with the glamor of Moscow, but disconnected from that inevitable association with repressive politics and organized crime."

I'm involved in every aspect of the show, which can be grueling but I wouldn't have it any other way. I started designing for this collection immediately after I finished my last. My design team and I go to Première Vision in Paris every year to start selecting fabrics. It's a huge fabric trade show with vendors from around the world, and it's incredible to attend. We make a lot of decisions about the direction of the collection during this time when we see all of the new fabrics. At the same time, we start sketching... hundreds of sketches! By the time the collection is complete we will have used about a third of what we sketched, and many of the sketches I do use have evolved several times.By the beginning of winter we have started to make samples. We first make everything in muslin, which is a natural cotton. We see what the pieces will look like once made in their intended fabric; and we play around with fit and the general design of the piece in ways you can't when it's just a sketch. We have dozens, maybe even hundreds of fittings during this stage. The fittings are when we try the clothes on the models. As soon as a piece goes through this process it's time to make it for real! This is my favorite part of the whole process -- seeing my designs come to life. Meanwhile, as it gets close to Fashion Week I'm busy thinking about all the other elements besides the collection that need attention. The purpose of a fashion show is to present your collection to the press and buyers, but there are also many other creative elements during the show that need careful thought to help convey your collections' inspiration, point of view and mood. We decide on the set design for the runway and the music. This is a really fun part, because both the set design and music help to tell the story of the collection. It's another ingredient. My spring 2013 collection had an ethereal feel, so the set reflected a lot of light and the music had a bit of a dreamy mood. This season, for fall 2013, I'm feeling much more moody and dark so the music and set will echo that. Yet, with all that said, it's important to remember the thread that connects every collection I do and the woman I design for. She is strong, independent, bold, feminine and modern; and that will never change. Nothing is too far in one direction. The hair and makeup is another element I spend a lot of time thinking about. I generally prefer very natural makeup and easy hair; I like to think about what the woman who wears my designs would look like. A light pink lip and soft hair worked last season, this season I think my girl will want to turn it up a notch to reflect my darker mood. We hold a hair and makeup test a couple days before the show to try out different looks. Casting the show is another great passion of mine. People have joked with me that in another life I was a casting director -- who knows! But I do love this part. Finding a new face is a great thrill. I've been lucky enough to have worked with some of the top models in the industry. We'll see hundreds of girls before we find the right ones to walk in the show. I always love a fresh face, but we also need to think about the clothes and the mood of the collection and which models will best illustrate that and at the same time represent the Jill Stuart woman. It's been weeks of late nights -- lots of coffee, takeout and succumbing to chocolate cravings. Hopefully you've learned a little bit about what goes into putting a collection together -- I do it all for you!Check out my show on February 9th online! Stay tuned for my next post!"
