0,TRAVEL,"Oxford, England: Two Exhibitions Worth A Day Trip","Edward Schneider, Contributor
Travel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oxford-england-day-trips_us_5b9c96e8e4b03a1dcc801622,"Oxford is a wonderful place for a day trip from London. While the college and university buildings are the obvious draws, there is much more here to entertain intrepid visitors.",2012-12-11,ENGLAND Oxfordshire Oxford The Radcliffe Camera completed in 1757.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c96e81f000051002147f2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Oxford is a wonderful place for a day trip from London. The college and university buildings are the most obvious attractions, even though some of them are off limits to tourists (take a look at this list of colleges and check the individual links to find out about visiting). But too many tourists neglect the university's many museums and exhibition spaces, whose shows are always interesting and can be spectacular, drawing as they often do on uncommonly rich collections of art, books and manuscripts. During an early December trip to London, my wife and I boarded an express bus (see below for travel tips) and spent a few hours in Oxford to meet friends for lunch and to see two of those shows: one at the newly expanded Ashmolean Museum and one at the Bodleian Library. We're in the lucky position of knowing the town reasonably well, so we were able to resist the temptation to turn this into a full day of tourism. Even if you're a stranger to the place, however, you may want to make time to take a look at one or both of these exhibitions.The one that originally drew us to Oxford and was the focus of our day was the Ashmolean's ""Threads of Silk and Gold: Ornamental Textiles From Meiji Japan,"" which runs until January 27. We'd recently been to Japan and thought it might be fun to see this selection of dyed and embroidered decorative works made between the 1860s and the early 20th century -- but intended for the Western market not for Japanese customers. Not surprisingly, little of this exported material is to be found in Japanese museums, and one institution in particular, the Kiyomizu-Sannenzaka Museum in Kyoto, has been making an effort to collect examples and bring them back to the country in which they were made. Most of the works on display come from that museum; they are supplemented with pieces lent by private owners or drawn from the Ashmolean's own collection.For the most part, these then-trendy items were used in Victorian homes as wall hangings, draperies and screens and in other decorative ways. So many artists of the era adored them. A couple of photographs (I wish there'd been more) show such fabrics in densely furnished, high-ceilinged English rooms. Nothing could look more different from the spare, compact domestic arrangements in Japan, and to a modern eye the scale seems all wrong: it is odd to see 10 or 12 feet of space between the top of a folding screen and the ceiling.But then, these are not the sort of fabrics we'd expect to see in a traditional Japanese house: They are themselves busy and crowded, often gaudy in fact. For example, a group of hyper-realistic, highly colored embroideries of animals such as lions look disconcertingly like things you'd see at a sidewalk art show, perhaps painted on velvet. It is as though the makers, with a certain impression of their customers' tastes, were interested less in conforming to Japanese aesthetics than in showing off their technique.And what technique! Once we got over the shock of the busyness of most of these works, we started looking at them more closely and were bowled over by the perfection of the dyeing and the stitching. In one of the works, ""Cranes,"" the glossy whiteness of the silk threads is almost luminescent, and a piece that appears in the show's publicity material, an embroidered peacock screen, could almost be gold-decorated lacquerware (maki-e). Even those wild-animal panels -- frankly hideous to a 21st-century viewer -- are marvels of needlework and worthy of scrutiny. Presumably, Victorian customers thought they were buying authentic Things Japanese; it would have been useful for the exhibition to address this in greater detail.Especially if, like us, you tend to think of Japanese artisans as invariably practicing a Zen-like minimalism, spending an hour viewing these works might be a useful correction -- and it will certainly be entertaining.No less entertaining (and rather more satisfying aesthetically) was a last-minute addition to our itinerary: ""Love and Devotion: From Persia and Beyond,"" a modestly sized but splendid exhibition at the Bodleian Library which will be open until April 28. It features gorgeous 13th- to 18th-century illustrated manuscripts from Persia, Moghul India and Ottoman Turkey, mostly on the theme of human or divine love. Most museum-goers will have seen at least a few leaves of what are broadly called Persian miniatures, combining calligraphy, illustration and decoration. Here, you will get to see many pages from manuscripts of stories, love poems and semi-mythic histories, full of beauty, joy and emotion. I wish we'd spent a little more time there, but shadows were lengthening and the London bus beckoned.* * *From London you can get to Oxford in as little as 58 minutes by train from Paddington Station, and tickets booked well in advance can be amazingly cheap: We've paid less than £5 ($7.50) each way when we've had sufficient foresight to catch the best online deals at www.nationalrail.co.uk. But typical fares are far higher -- a last-minute round trip ticket could cost the better part of £30 -- and a reliably inexpensive travel option is one of the express bus services that run frequently between the two cities: Oxford Tube and the Oxford Bus Company's X90. The fare is £16 round trip, which you pay as you board without having to commit to a specific time for the return journey.The bus routes begin at Victoria Station, with stops near Marble Arch and elsewhere; there are a couple of equally useful stops in Oxford, including on the High Street, and the buses terminate at Gloucester Green, far more central than the railway station. The trip can take 90 minutes or it can take longer if you get stuck in traffic, but it is a pleasant, comfortable ride during which you can revel in the free wifi."

For me, it was a trip to Greece when I was 16. I was a ""boarder"" at St. Catherine's School in Richmond, Virginia, an all girl's school with top academics and no boys. I had arrived there from Salisbury, North Carolina, an idyllic southern town that I still call home, but one where I never envisioned the need or desire to travel abroad. Charlotte, an hour away, was a long trip to me.Part of the academic year was a ""mini-mester,"" and that year I choose a trip to Greece.

Last-minute trips and limited sleep created coffee-filled, fuzzy-head Monday mornings.Then I had kids.And while my weekends now are more about kid's birthday parties and household chores than jetting off to the coolest parties, I still find myself hitting Monday morning with a headache. Duh! It's because, if you look at it, life really hasn't changed all that much. In fact, you can just replace the word ""Vegas"" with ""parenting"" and it's all pretty much the same. Trashed Rooms  Rock stars and celebrities have nothing on my kids. Even after a Saturday morning of cleaning and organizing (I'm that mom with labeled bins for everything), their bedrooms look like the morning after a raging party. All-Nighters  Somehow, going to bed at 6 a.m. after being up with a child who's thrown up his dinner all over your dry-clean-only comforter doesn't feel the same as those long nights dancing and/or gambling. Although I've got to admit, it's much less humiliating doing the walk of shame to the laundry room than it was through a casino. 24/7 Buffet  ""Can we have a snack?"" ""No, I want something else!"" No sooner than one meal is done, my kids become bottomless pits -- already ready for more. But unlike the servers in Vegas, this waitress requires them to actually finish what's on their plate, including their veggies.Room Service  Is it just in my house, or do the rest of you feel like you're regularly catering to the whims of tiny-yet-demanding guests? Would it kill them to throw a tip our way on occasion?Reckless Behavior  Like tiny drunk people, kids are constantly acting as if they've had one too many and you just never really know which personality you'll get. One minute they're clinging to you... the next they're fighting with each other -- and before you know it, you've got a sobbing, overly-emotional human accusing you of loving someone else more. Time Abyss  Walk into a casino and you have no idea whether it's light or dark outside, Saturday night or Wednesday morning. If you've ever had a kid home during school break, that same phenomenon occurs. Showgirls  Take one of those elaborate Vegas stage performances, complete with over-the-top costumes and demanding directors, add a few items of clothing and some awkward, nose-picking kiddos -- poof! It's like being at the latest Cirque du Soleil show, except this time there's a chance the show will be stopped by a stubborn actor crying for his mama (oh, and no cocktails). Hype  While Vegas can provide ample moments of fun and excitement, sometimes it feels a bit overrated. The novelty can wear off pretty quickly, leaving you wondering if you can grab that earlier Southwest flight in time to get home and sleep it off. But, like parenting, just a few minutes after leaving, you start to miss it and look forward to getting back as soon as possible. Agony of Defeat  On the rare occasion you win a round of Blackjack, you're likely to lose your shirt a few minutes later -- just like those tiny parenting victories. Both will leave you feeling defeated and in need of a drink. What Happens at Home, Stays at Home  Finally, like Vegas, things that go down behind our own closed doors oftentimes best left there. No one needs to know that mom lost her cool over a Buzz Lightyear toy on the stairs or that Dad forgot to pay the cable bill. That's why it's important to keep your escapades to yourself. Because if people knew the real behind-closed-door stories, there's no way they'd even dare go to Vegas -- or become a parent."

Running for for the 9 days leading up to the 10th anniversary of the terrorist attacks, the Museum will display more than 50 objects from the World Trade Center, Pentagon and Shanksville, Pennsylvania, in an exhibit titled, 'September 11: Remembrance and Reflection.' AFP PHOTO / Saul LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c9914250000350036214a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the more interesting reactions to last week's post arguing that the TSA as we know it is dead came from a publicist for one of the airline trade associations.In a polite but insistent email, he claimed I'd misunderstood the congressional testimony by one of his executives. The airline industry rep was criticizing government regulations -- not the TSA -- for being expensive, inconsistent and reactive, he said.It made me wonder: Why would airlines not want to be seen as criticizing the TSA? Everyone else is. I mean, how could airlines not have a problem with what critics say is an $8 billion boondoggle? No one has to work closer with these troubled federal screeners than commercial air carriers, so when it comes to the topic of much-needed improvement, you'd expect airlines to offer Congress an earful.It's their TSAWhen you scroll back to the beginning of this 11-year-old agency, it's clear why the airlines don't want to be heard bad-mouthing the TSA. Before 9/11, air carriers had to pay for their own security screening, which was an added expense they didn't want.Today, passengers pay through a combination of taxes and a 9/11 surcharge added to their tickets.Dig deeper, and it's hard not to conclude that, in some respects, the airline industry has a TSA it's always dreamed about. Not only does the agency deal with the pesky back-end security processes, like pre-screening passengers based on their personal data and matching them against the terrorist watchlist, but now airlines also have a convenient place to send all of the passenger complaints about pilfered luggage.That's right, they pass them off to the TSA.Unfortunately for a vast majority of passengers, the TSA is a black hole for complaints, to the point where most air travelers don't even bother filing one when something is stolen from a checked bag during screening. The latest agency figures say only three in 100,000 air travelers file a claim, and its rejection rates are high. I've lost count of the number of air travelers who have simply given up after filing a claim with the TSA and waiting. Special statusBut why would the airline industry support an agency that, in the minds of its passengers, is deeply flawed and in dire need of reform? Sadly, it's probably because the status quo suits it. Pilots and flight attendants get access to special lines and are spared the most invasive screening -- the humiliating full-body scans and pat-downs. Are airline employees less of a security risk than passengers? Not necessarily. Who can forget Clayton Frederick Osbon, the JetBlue pilot who had a ""psychotic breakdown"" on a flight from New York to Las Vegas earlier this year. Or EgyptAir first officer Gameel Al-Batouti, who, investigators concluded, committed suicide when he crashed EgyptAir Flight 990 into the Atlantic just south of Nantucket Island in 1999.What's more, the TSA's authoritarian attitude sets a tone for the entire flight, so post-9/11 passengers tend to be more cooperative when flight attendants ask them to comply with their instructions. Having passengers heel obediently when someone in uniform barks an order seems to fit the airline industry agenda. After all, the interior of an aircraft is no democracy.To be fair, I'm sure there are many airline employees who are horrified by what's become of the TSA and support the reforms suggested by agency critics and Congress. But at least on the record, their employers seem to like things the way they are.Why? For the airline industry, even a bad TSA is better than what they had before. Key security responsibilities and costs have been removed, thanks to this overfunded agency. And its employees have special status, effectively enjoying the same security screening experience as they did before 9/11, for no other reason than that they wear a uniform. What's not to like about that?Who fixes this mess?Should airlines clean up this mess of a federal agency? It is partially responsible for today's TSA, no doubt about it. But there's plenty of blame to go around for America's mismanaged and heavily criticized airport screening bureaucracy. In order to create a dysfunctional TSA, many key stakeholders essentially remained silent for a decade. That includes an apathetic electorate, which failed to see the constitutional, privacy and civil rights problems of the current TSA. But it's especially true of the most powerful airline passengers, the elite-level frequent business travelers and the corporate travel managers controlling their purse-strings. These road warriors, who really should have known better, gave the current TSA their stamp of approval by staying quiet as a group, and their silence has been rewarded with a ""free"" trusted traveler designation that lets them shortcut the worst of the screening experience.But it's safe to say that without the support of airlines, the TSA would have never become America's most-hated federal agency -- and that without its help, we don't stand a chance of reforming the TSA. The airline industry's inaction in the face of gross incompetence, criminality and unconstitutional behavior by the TSA, may have served its interests in the short term. But over the long term, it will hurt everyone."

I'm not. This is what it is really like to celebrate the holidays by selecting that very special tree for your family to decorate. How To Buy A Christmas Tree With a Preschooler and a Kindergartener1. On the first below-30-degree day of the season after two weeks of holiday travel and a husband M.I.A. due to the busiest work period of the year, select today as the day to surprise your kids with Christmas tree shopping when you pick the 3.5-year-old girl and 5.5-year-old boy up from school.2. Tell them you have a BIG SURPRISE for them.3. Bring them home, get them both to pee without totally removing all their clothes*, re-bundle them up and grab snacks and water, all while batting away screeches of delight and nagging inquiries as to what this surprise could possibly be (""Is Santa here? Are we getting a cookie? Are we going to the airport? Is 'Max & Ruby' on? Are we going to the Lego store?"").4. Get them back in the truck, buckled in.5. Try not to go deaf during the drive to charity Christmas Tree sale.6. Park.7. Pull out camera, gloves, measuring tape.8.

Realize it doesn't open for another three hours.11. Get back in the truck.12. Drive weeping children back home.13.

Bribe.18. Beg for mercy and swear on your life they can buy the biggest damn tree in the place if they Just. Stop. Whining.19. Wait three hours.20. Make them pee (again).21.

Explain to 3.5-year-old that you can't buy the wooden sign in the shape of a tree or the tree painted on the side of the trailer.28. Watch 3.5-year-old stomp her foot and pretend to cry over inability to buy trees that aren't actually tress until Old Dude who works there and has experience with ornery grandchildren distracts her.29. Lose the 5.5-year-old amidst the trees.30. Find the 5.5-year-old.31. Ask for the tall trees.32. Lose the 3.5-year-old while walking towards the tall trees.33. Find the 3.5-year-old.34. Quietly threaten both children that if they run off again, they will not get a Christmas tree.35. Silently pray you don't have to actually follow through on this threat.36. Feel a twinge of guilt asking two Old Dudes volunteering there to heave a couple 9+ foot-tall trees up so you can fully inspect the suckers** before choosing one.37. Hear the sobs of your 5.5-year-old who is insisting he ""HATE that tree"" and wants one of the stacked and bound trees not on display.38. Watch 3.5-year-old try to spear herself with a wrought iron tree stand.39. Act all excited about the tree you have chosen in an attempt to round up unruly kids, asking Old Guys to hold it up to take a photo of the kids in front of it.40. Watch the kids both start crying and yelling that they want different trees while running in opposite directions.41. Tell the frightened Old Dudes ""we'll take it"" with a forced smile on your lips.42.

Grab 5.5-year-old.44. Lose sight of 3.5-year-old (again).45. See friends coming.46. Find 3.5-year-old when she dashes from behind a display of Douglas Firs to join her friends.47. Finally see the kids cheer up when all four of them start making fun of you in unison.48. Walk away from annoying kids to pay for tree.49. Try not to pass out at the price of a 10-foot Christmas tree.50. Distract kids with piles of leaves while high schoolers take foooooreeeeeveeer to tie the tree to the roof of the truck. Oooh a fence!
