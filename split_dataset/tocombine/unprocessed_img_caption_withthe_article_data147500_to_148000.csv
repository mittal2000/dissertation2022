Bill has worked for Harley-Davidson for 29 years and has lived in the area his entire life. He is currently the vice president of the Harley-Davidson Museum located a few miles from the company's Milwaukee headquarters.Dear Milwaukee,I want to start by saying thank you for being a longtime friend to my family and supporter of the great brand they created more than 110 years ago. I often wonder if my great grandfather, great uncles and their friend Bill Harley really understood how their motorcycle would inspire a culture and lifestyle that would bring people together from all around the world. More important is the fact that they choose Milwaukee to be the home of their innovation. I believe they did this because of all the wonderful things this city stands for. The people and industry here in Milwaukee represent all the qualities necessary to help build a brand like Harley-Davidson - one focused on family, pride, strong work ethic and camaraderie. Milwaukeeans have an unmatched creative and fun loving spirit, and they possess the skills and passion to produce some of the best products in the world. I imagine these qualities, along with Milwaukee's hometown Midwestern values, are some of the many reasons why Arthur, Walter, my great grandfather, William, and Bill Harley's dream of two-wheeled motorized transportation started here in this amazing city. It's exciting, and almost unbelievable, that we are now celebrating our 110th anniversary. And as Harley-Davidson embarks on new journeys, it's great to know we can count on you to come along for the ride. Thank you for all the great memories we've shared, and the exciting ones we will create in the years to come.Bill Davidson"
1,TRAVEL,Tips for Booking Flights on Europe's Budget Airlines,"EuroCheapo, Contributor
European budget travel guides",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/europe-budget-airlines_us_5b9d628ce4b03a1dcc8759db,"It costs how much to fly from London to Berlin? I just searched for the flight for mid-October and found incredibly (some would say ""suspiciously"") cheap offers. What's the catch?",2013-07-31,"FRANCE - SEPTEMBER 15: Ryan air announces opening of Nantes-Eire and Nantes-England services In Nantes, France On September 15, 2005-Irish low-cost airline Ryanair announced the opening of service between Nantes and Shannon (3 flights/week from Nov. 1). Ryanair Vice-CEO Michael Cawley also announced the opening of Nantes/London daily service from Jan. 11, 2006 and Nantes/Nottingham on March 7, 2006 (3 flights a week). The Nantes expects to see an additional 200,000 passengers in 2006 and the creation of 200 jobs thanks to the new Ryanair services.

I just searched for the flight for mid-October and found incredibly (some would say ""suspiciously"") cheap offers from easyJet (€40 / $52) and Ryanair (€46 / $59).That's super cheapo, and not even unusual for Europe's budget airlines, which have been known to offer tickets for as low as £1... or even free. How is this possible? What's the catch?Pay attention to the airportTo keep ticket prices low, budget airlines often use less-central airports that can take more time (and money) to get to. For example, consider Ryanair's flights from London to Barcelona. Some of these flights arrive into Girona-Costa Brava airport, 57 miles away from Barcelona. Although regular bus service between the airport and Barcelona is timed according to arriving and departing flights, mishaps (and unintended overnights) do happen.Watch those baggage policies...Many budget carriers try to recoup losses on very low ticket prices through sky-high charges for checked and carry-on luggage. Take special note of the baggage policies when booking, and consider your options. And be aware that some carriers charge less if you pre-pay for your checked bags.Ryanair, for example, charges between €15-45 for checking luggage (up to 20 kg) when the bags are paid for in advance. If you forget and pay at the airport, you'll be charged an outrageous €60-140 for the first bag and €105-160 for the second bag! There's nothing sadder than watching last-minute luggage catastrophes at the Ryanair bag-drop....and those hidden feesAs my colleague Hilary Bown recently wrote on our blog, budget carriers famously tack on additional fees, including administrative fees, check-in charges, and credit card surcharges.For example, Ryanair charges a €7 ""administrative fee"" per flight, while easyJet charges €12.50 per order (regardless of number of tickets). And they both add a surcharge for tickets purchases by credit card (Ryanair charges two percent; easyJet 2.5 percent).Don't forget to compare trains as an optionEurope's high-speed trains often offer a compelling alternative to flying, especially for shorter distances. For these routes (such as London to Paris, Paris to Brussels and Amsterdam, Barcelona to Madrid) the train might actually be faster once you add the time that it takes to get to the airports, checked in and through security.And once you consider baggage fees and extra charges, a high-speed train could easily be cheaper, too. (Read my previous post on booking rail tickets in Europe.)Know where to searchFrom the U.S., airfare on carriers such as easyJet, Ryanair, Germanwings and others are not always easy to find, as they're often not included (or at least highlighted) in the search results of some of the largest airfare websites. Expedia, for example, didn't show me Ryanair and easyJet flights on a recent search for London to Berlin, although Kayak did. We also include them on our flights search on EuroCheapo, and we compare them to legacy carriers (such as Lufthansa and Air France), along with high-speed rail options.Book in advance and snag a great dealAll caveats and hidden fees aside, Europe's budget airlines can offer some incredibly good deals. If you book in advance, limit your luggage and follow the rules, very cheap flights are possible.A version of this article was originally published on EuroCheapo."
2,PARENTING,Because Our Children Are Watching,"Carin Kilby Clark, Contributor
The Mommyhood Mentor®",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/because-our-children-are_us_5b9d6479e4b03a1dcc877277,"As I think about my three kids, and what they observe in my life, I know that I have to do my best to be the kind of person that I want my children to be, we all do; because our children are watching.",2013-07-31,2013-07-31-carin-kilby-clark-becauseourchildrenarewatchingpic343x400.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-07-31-carin-kilby-clark-becauseourchildrenarewatchingpic343x400.jpg,"As parents, there are very few aspects of our lives that our children don't witness. They are there when we wake, go to work, socialize with our friends, make dinner, interact with our significant others, and all the other things that we do as we juggle the many demands of life. They watch as we laugh and cry at life's many curve balls, as we grow and excel in our professions, and as we live and work with a passion that naturally occurs when we spend our time doing what matters most to us. What is interesting about their stare upon our lives is that, while they are watching, they are also constructing; taking in all the characteristics of what their lives should be when they are old enough to create their very own. As I think about my three kids, and what they observe in my life, I know that I have to do my best to be the kind of person that I want my children to be, we all do; because our children are watching. Examples of areas where we need to be especially mindful of our behaviors include:CommunicationThey watch how we treat people -- how we communicate -- and how we react to difficult situations. Our children learn how to interact with others by watching what we do when we speak to our friends, family, and associates. The way we communicate, and what they observe, is what shapes their communication styles. Being a good listener, knowing what's appropriate to say in various situations, and how to treat people with respect and kindness are all traits they learn from watching us communicate with those around us. We have a responsibility to show them the right way to talk to people and the proper way to react to those who may be less than kind to us. SticktoitivenessYou know all those projects we tend to start and never finish? Yeah, they notice that too. Our ability to press on, stay focused, and work towards achievement of our goals sets a shining example for our children to do the same. If we constantly start something, do it for a while, then drop it for the next big thing without seeing it through, then there is a high likelihood that they will emulate the same behavior. If we want them to make commitments and see things through to the end, we need to show them how it's done.EmotionsAnger, sadness, happiness, disappointment, despair, joy -- all the emotions we display in front of our children are the emotions they learn to exhibit themselves. The way we react to our lives, i.e. financial difficulties, failures, accomplishments, changes, will show our children how they should react to theirs. If we often get frustrated and act out when things are not going our way or get angry and have outbursts when something upsets us, then they are likely to do the same when their emotions rear up. It is our job to show them the proper way to work through those emotions, by our example.ActionsWe define who we are by our thoughts. Our thoughts define our actions. Our actions are what create our lives and form our habits. If we care about health and fitness, that is what we will think about, and we will then eat certain foods or exercise regularly to maintain our fitness goals. Our children notice these defining habits and they are likely to want to do the same. If we are workaholics that keep 24/7 hours they will notice that too. We owe it to our children to pay attention to our actions and make sure we are defining a life that we want them to strive for. The core values and ethics that we want our children to have are best learned when they watch us acting them out. Imagine yourself as the star in your child's favorite movie; and them watching intently, taking mental notes, and recalling your scenes as they grow into and learn how to be their own person. At some point in their lives, what they have witnessed us doing is likely to become the path they will take. It is critical to choose the life you would want your child to replicate; because our children are watching."

They’re so light and fluffy, and they masterfully absorb butter and syrup. Or at least that’s the case when you make pancakes right. But not all pancakes are made properly. Actually, a lot of people botch their pancakes. It’s time we put a stop to this.The principles behind making the perfect pancakes are simple: Just whip up a quick batter and fry them up. But so much can go wrong along the way, risking dense, flat or burned pancakes. If you’ve experienced these pancake tragedies, you’re probably committing at least one, if not all nine, of the common pancake mistakes. Find out what they are and put an end to your pancake misery."
