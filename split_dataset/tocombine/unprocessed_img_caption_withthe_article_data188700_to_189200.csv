Four times as good when eaten in an outdoor space surrounded by white string lights and with a view of any body of water.,2012-05-17,Shredding Bagged Lettuce Makes It Taste Fresher And Better,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9bb8043c00004c00097f1f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Those of you who have your Ph.D in D.A.L.S. are already aware of the groundbreaking scientific work we've done on our blog establishing various theories about dinner -- the preparing of it, the consumption of it, the enjoyment of it. For instance, this well-worn favorite: 1. When you take three measly minutes in the morning to do something that helps you get the momentum going on dinner prep -- chopping vegetables, marinating meat, placing a pot of water on the stovetop -- you will end up saving up to 15 minutes on the other end of the day when you arrive home from work. I can't pretend to know why this is the case -- as backing up our dinner theories with real data tends to take more time than we actually have. Time we would rather spend coming up with more impossible-to-prove wrong theories. Such as:"

The plaintiffs are seeking recognition for any person who purchased the Garnier serum from Feb. 4, 2008, to the present. According to the lawsuit and Top Class Actions law blog, the Garnier serum’s two main ingredients are cyclopentasiloxane and dimethiconol, chemicals that can ignite at 171 degrees Fahrenheit. (Flat iron temperatures typically range from 300-450 degrees Fahrenheit.)A copy of the original lawsuit, filed in June 2011, can be found here.OMG. We've totally used that stuff before, without any bonfire-type incidents. But of course, flammable products are not exactly something you want coming between your hair and a high-heat styling appliance like a blow dryer or flat iron, which most women use on a regular basis.We've contacted L'Oreal for comment on this lawsuit, and we'll keep you posted on whether the Garnier anti-frizz serum will be yanked from the shelves, but in the meantime, check out some other controversial beauty products below.UPDATE: L'Oreal tells us, ""We cannot comment on the current lawsuit except to say that L’Oréal denies the allegations and will continue to vigorously defend Garnier Fructis Sleek & Shine Anti-Frizz Serum as safe for consumers."""
2,STYLE & BEAUTY,Kim Kardashian eBay Sale Includes Lots Of Black & White Clothing (PHOTOS),,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kim-kardashian-ebay-clothes-charity-sale_us_5b9bba38e4b03a1dcc79e375,"So where has all the leopard print gone? On eBay -- although to be fair, there's plenty of black, white and gray Kimmy clothes",2012-05-17,"Giambattista Valli Tiger Print Knit Dress, $205.00",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9bba262000003000fd4e8f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Fun fact: Kim Kardashian is selling her clothes on eBay. We can't make this stuff up. Kim and Kourtney have teamed with the e-commerce site's Fashion Vault, which hosts weekly flash sales with all sorts of designer goodies. The latest sale is titled ""Kardashians' Closet"" and is filled with Kim and Kourtney's pricey castoffs -- think Christian Louboutin, Fendi, Burberry, Gucci and a surprising amount of Alexander Wang. With an insatiable appetite for designer gear and a schedule full of red carpet appearances, why would Kim want to empty out her closet (and on eBay, no less)? For charity, of course: ""a portion of the proceeds"" from Kim's sale will go to Life Change Community Church, the reality family's house of worship (yes, Kim Kardashian goes to church). Another reason Kim may be jettisoning a portion of her closet, some speculate, is her new BF, Kanye West. We have noticed (and Fashionista even illustrated) that since beginning her ""relationship"" with Kanye, Kim has ditched her colorful outfits, opting instead for black, white and gray numbers. Black leggings and a white jacket for date night, an LBD at the Lakers game, a black and white halter dress for a Chanel dinner -- as one half of KimYe, Kim is all monochrome, all the time. So where has all the leopard print gone? On eBay -- although to be fair, there's plenty of black, white and gray Kimmy clothes being sold online, too. Peruse Kim's online flash sale (we've rounded up most of the pieces below). You may be surprised to find how much you like some of the items, from classy black pumps to slouchy Alexander Wang dresses. Luckily it's all on sale for the next three days, so that Cavalli animal-print jumpsuit can still be yours. Go to fashionvault.ebay.com/kardashian to shop it all.Want more?
