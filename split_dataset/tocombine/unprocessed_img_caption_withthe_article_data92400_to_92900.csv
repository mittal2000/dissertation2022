The coach added that it's not just student-athletes who leave college early for one reason or another and that he supports any student's decision to do so. He also pushed back against claims that players are simply recruited for a year before they turn pro.""All these kids ... my guys are great,"" Krzyzewski said. ""They go to school, they love Duke, they live with the other students, and the rent-a-thing is kind of harsh.""Krzyzewski's comments follow those of Wisconsin coach Bo Ryan, who took a thinly veiled shot in a press conference following last night's game. (Krzyzewski had a court stacked with powerful freshman this season, including Tyus Jones, Justise Winslow and Jahlil Okafor, who is widely expected to be one of the top picks in this year's NBA draft.)""We don't do a rent-a-player. You know what I mean?"" Ryan said, when asked about his departing senior players. ""Try to take a fifth-year guy. That's okay. If other people do that, that's okay. I like trying to build from within. It's just the way I am.""Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill (D) also weighed in in a series of tweets on Monday.For its own part, the NCAA has tried to defend against ""one-and-done"" perceptions in men's basketball. It argued that on average only eight college freshmen have been drafted into the NBA ever year since high school players were made ineligible in 2006. There has been debate regarding the age minimum for entering the NBA draft, which currently stands at 19 and requires anyone entering to be at least one year out of high school. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said he wants to further raise the age limit to 20, but has faced fierce pushback from the National Basketball Players Association.Coach K echoed that criticism, saying he would allow players to be eligible for the draft straight out of high school. However, he added if a player does go to school, ""I would like to see them there for two years, so they’d be halfway towards a degree, probably more than halfway with summer school.""""In today’s world you have to adapt to what’s happening,"" he said. ""If the opportunity arises for a youngster to leave early from school, whether he’s an athlete or she’s an athlete or not, it’s their opportunity to pursue it. So I think we’re living in the dark ages when we say that it should only be done one way."""

And if you aren't part of the fandom, you probably wonder why so many people care so much about a bunch of players they don't even know.",2015-04-07,"Wisconsin's Frank Kaminsky and Josh Gasser (21) react after the NCAA Final Four college basketball tournament championship game against Duke Monday, April 6, 2015, in Indianapolis. Duke won 68-63. (AP Photo/Michael Conroy)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9eaa9c2400003100541462.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's a tale as old as time: You're a sports fan. A sports fan who thinks this could be ""the year"" for your team. You want your team to win so badly it hurts (like, it actually hurts, because you cheered so loudly you no longer have a voice, and you're pretty sure the nail-biting stress of the postseason has given you acid reflux). And then... your team loses. You watch as your favorite players hang their heads, and your own heart similarly breaks.That was me on Monday night as I watched my team -- the Wisconsin Badgers -- fall to the Duke Blue Devils in the 2015 NCAA Championship game. You've probably seen the viral video of the  Villanova band member who valiantly played her piccolo through her tears after her team's loss in the Round of 32. Wisconsin now has our own meme-worthy display of team heartbreak in the sad young man wearing the red Teletubby costume.Unless you belong to the lucky few, a sports fan's journey ends the same way each season: just short of one more W. And if you aren't part of the fandom, you probably wonder why so many people care so much about a bunch of players (in this case, college students as young as 19 years old) they don't even know.Plenty of reasons, actually.As spectators, we will most likely never experience for ourselves (unless you're an elite athlete who also happens to be a fan, like Aaron Rodgers) the overwhelming thrill and flood of emotion that comes with winning a trophy on a national stage. Rooting for the players gives us a chance to ""own"" a minuscule share of the team's success. As psychology professor Ronald F. Levant put it in a 2010 CantonRep.com article, ""Identifying with your sports teams is one of the ways you can vicariously experience success, and in real life, success is hard."" After the Duke loss, when I saw this photo of Frank Kaminsky and Josh Gasser, I swore I could feel the players' pain. A bit dramatic, you think? Maybe not. In a January 2015 piece for the Washington Post, Eric Simons, author of The Secret Lives of Sports Fans, wrote, ""In all kinds of unconscious ways, a fan mirrors the feelings, actions and even hormones of players."" Simons said in an email correspondence with HuffPost that people feel for athletes ""because you know rationally what it means to them, and because you wanted so badly for them to achieve something."" So there's sympathy involved, but there's empathy, too -- something Simons details in his book. In this case, the fan treats the loss ""as not just something affecting [the athlete] but as a personal loss."" And it's possible to feel both at the same time, he adds. ""You can feel like you personally lost something and you can feel bad for players that you like."" The moment the Duke Blue Devils were named the 2015 NCAA Champions, my social media feeds exploded with messages from and to Badger fans -- the majority of them kind words and support for the group of young men who were likely feeling all kinds of awful. However, there was plenty of frustrated commentary as well. Simons said it's normal for fans to experience a range of emotions following a loss.""It's so fascinating, all the things that go into your response to a game ... there's so much individual variation ... And it illustrates a really important point, I think, about how messy our response to life is ... We can hold competing and even contradictory thoughts and emotions in our heads, and the players and the fans are all doing this -- you're proud, and disappointed, and sad, and sympathetic, and maybe frustrated or angry, and all at the same time, of course, and that jumble can be overwhelming ... which is why if you're a Wisconsin fan or player, you may spend today just sort of staring blankly at the walls.""It's not all doom and gloom and staring at walls for fans of defeated teams, however. HuffPost editor Anna Almendrala writes in this piece from January 2015 that sure, your blood pressure might rise during a game, which isn't ideal, and you may experience sadness after a loss, but participating in sports fandom ""is also linked to higher levels of well-being and general happiness with one's social life."" And in a 2014 Seattle Times article, sports columnist Larry Stone referred to studies that suggest ""rabid sports fans have higher self-esteem and are less depressed, less alienated and less lonely."" So while we may be disappointed today, Wisconsin fans, we'd arguably be far worse off without the fandom. Keep your chins up, Badgers."
5,TRAVEL,6 Secrets To Summer Travel Deals,"U.S. News Travel, ContributorU.S. News & World Report Travel",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/6-secrets-for-scoring-sum_b_7019962.html,"With millions of Americans planning to travel this summer and airfare rates steadily climbing, organizing a budget-conscious getaway can seem unattainable. It doesn't have to be.",2015-04-07,2015-04-07-1428436100-487036-mainhuffpo_edited.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-07-1428436100-487036-mainhuffpo_edited-thumb.jpg," Tavis Jacobs / FlickrFor most of us, summer means escaping to embrace a few days of beachside relaxation, exhilarating adventures or off-the-grid exploration. But with millions of Americans planning to travel this summer and airfare rates steadily climbing, organizing a budget-conscious getaway can seem unattainable. It doesn't have to be: With a little legwork and proactivity, clinching a bargain this summer is possible. U.S. News enlisted Jeanenne Tornatore, senior editor at Orbitz.com, and Jeff Klee, CEO of CheapAir.com, to lend their expertise for landing the season's top deals. Here are six pro tricks to help you pull off an affordable summer trip.In Pictures: The Best Summer Vacation Spots for 2015Time it right When it comes to searching for domestic flights, start the research process several months in advance. After conducting a 12-month-long study analyzing domestic fares across 15,000 markets and 1.5 billion ticket purchases, CheapAir found that the best time to buy tickets, on average, is 47 days ahead of your departure date. Purchasing within what Klee coins ""the prime booking window,"" or one to four months before your trip, yields an average savings of $201 per ticket, the study revealed.If you're planning to travel to Europe, you'll need to shift your purchase date to more than 270 days in advance to find the best savings, Klee advised. Tornatore also recommended purchasing your flight and hotel accommodations for popular summer weekends like Memorial Day as soon as possible, with early to mid-April being the best time to sniff out a deal. Also, consider vacationing later in the season. ""Historically looking back at the last few years, the majority of our bookings are in June and July,"" explained Tornatore, noting that if you have the flexibility to travel in August, you'll find more promotions.Consider alternative airports and conduct separate flight searches A tried-and-true industry trick is cross-comparing regional airport hubs to find the best deals. ""A lot of times, if you're flying to Miami, you'll see big differences by flying into Fort Lauderdale,"" explained Tornatore. The same can hold true for travelers flying in or out of Oakland International Airport rather than San Francisco International Airport, or Baltimore-Washington International Airport rather than Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.That said, airfare prices change often, making it difficult to find the perfect booking window for the best rate. And apart from constantly changing prices, there are also fluctuating fare brackets. According to Klee, every carrier has 10 to 15 price brackets per flight, and the amount you pay hinges on how many seats are taken. Once the lowest fare seats are taken, seat prices are bumped up to the next highest price bracket. Conversely, if seats are not selling, airlines will make seats available at a lower cost. Suppose you're searching for four seats on the same flight. If you search for all four seats at the same time, you might eliminate the chance to secure a ticket in the cheapest price category. What's the best approach? Searching for each passenger's flight separately, explained Klee, which will increase your odds of clinching tickets at the lowest price category available. That way, you'll maximize your chances of booking one or two tickets at a lower price, rather than paying a hefty amount for four tickets in a higher price bracket.Plan a mid-week getaway ""It really does make a big difference the day of the week that you fly. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are the least expensive days,"" explained Klee, noting that on average there's about an $80 difference if you travel on a Tuesday versus a Sunday. Planning a midweek journey can also equate to deeply discounted hotel rates, according to Tornatore. And if you're hoping to travel in June or July -- a popular summer travel period -- Tornatore advised consulting a variety of reputable hotel search and deal-focused sites now to get a sense of demand and affordability of your desired vacation destination. ""The hotel price is reflective of the cost of your trip,"" she explained, highlighting that if hotel prices are inflated, airfare and attraction prices will likely be expensive, too.See: Best Cheap Summer VacationsEvaluate the cost-benefit of vacation packages and attraction passes While it's true that bundling your airfare and hotel costs into a package can translate to deep discounts, there are exceptions to the rule. Klee explained that where you're going plays a key role. ""It's good to check both ways,"" he said, noting that many times you can find better choices and better prices by researching hotels and flights separately. Still, some leisure destinations offer compelling, high-value package deals: Klee pointed to Hawaii as an ideal spot for booking a vacation package.Another draw of booking a vacation package through an online travel agency? The ability to secure everything from ski lift tickets to theme park passes. Tornatore suggested booking multiday passes to score the best discounts.Use social media and your smartphone to your advantage In today's tech-savvy age, social media outlets, smartphones and apps serve as trusty resources for scoring travel deals and promotions. ""It would be helpful to follow every airline on Twitter. The smaller airlines tend to be more aggressive in having one-day promo codes that they tweet out,"" explained Klee. Airlines like JetBlue and Virgin America often offer flash sales and promotions on Twitter and Instagram. Hotel loyalty programs, including Starwood and Marriott, are also targeting social media users with free nights, tailored itinerary suggestions and special promotions for following and engaging with their social media accounts.Not an active social media user? You can still score deals -- and rack up loyalty program points -- with a few swipes on your touchscreen. For example, the Orbitz Rewards loyalty program allows travelers to accumulate up to a 5 percent points bonus, or Orbucks, for using Orbitz's mobile app. Other OTA loyalty programs offer equally enticing incentives. Expedia, for example, allows users to triple their points by booking their flights and hotels on the Expedia App. And even if you're not a loyalty program member, you can still reap rewards for choosing to book on your mobile device. Hotels.com, for instance, offers deals that enable travelers to save up to 25 percent by booking on their smartphones. Meanwhile, Travelocity offers mobile-exclusive promotions for downloading its free app.Branch away from the beach or city center If your dream summer getaway includes staking a beach umbrella in the sand, try booking a hotel that's removed from the shoreline, said Tornatore. You may not have a picture-perfect view overlooking the ocean, but you can find much better deals. And if you're traveling with kids in tow, Tornatore suggested searching for condo-style properties or hotels that offer family suites, which are often equipped with budget-effective amenities like kitchens -- an easy way to slash meal costs.Trying to find an affordable big-city adventure? ""If you're looking at really popular city destinations, look outside the perimeter a bit,"" advised Tornatore. ""In New York for example, in the summer on weekends, the Financial District is pretty cheap,"" she said, noting that business travelers flood the area during the weekdays but at the end of the week rooms empty out, making it a great time to find reduced rates.See: Best Family Summer VacationsAbout the author: Liz Weiss is an editor for the Travel section at U.S. News.

He came to win and he's prepared to win.,2015-04-07,"Tiger Woods during a practice round for the Masters golf tournament Tuesday, April 7, 2015, in Augusta, Ga. (AP Photo/Matt Slocum)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb77b77240000500057085e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Who can forget the 1997 Masters Tournament? In record-breaking fashion, 20 year-old Tiger Woods won his first major by 12 strokes. And he won again at Augusta in 2001, 2002 and 2005. This week, the world's top golfers come to the mecca of golf hoping to walk away with the coveted green jacket and enter the history books. And Woods, who took a recent departure from the game because he didn't feel he was ""tournament ready"" after a brief but shabby showing following back surgery last year, is back with his eyes on the green jacket for a fifth time. The big question: is he ready? Woods thinks so. He expects to be wearing the green jacket come Sunday afternoon. ""I worked my ass off,"" he said.""That's the easiest way to kind of describe it. I worked hard. People would never understand how much work I put into it to come back and do this again. It was sun up to sun down. Whenever I had time, free time, the kids were asleep I'd still be doing it. ... It was a lot of work.""Is a Tiger Woods' victory at this year's Masters really a possibility? You bet it is! I predicted a Tiger comeback on The Golf Channel a few years ago and I was correct. And I'm calling it again: Tiger Woods is far from finished.Here are five reasons why I believe Tiger Woods can win the 2015 Masters:Mental toughness: Tiger Woods is the most mentally tough athlete in all of golf, if not professional sports. If anyone is going to be able to outthink this nostalgic setting, and overcome obstacles like Rae's Creek, Amen Corner and the pressure of capturing the green jacket, it's Tiger Woods. Tiger Woods thrives on pressure. To the average performer, pressure is something to be avoided. It brings fear and discomfort. The great ones like Tiger Woods thrive on pressure. Not only is The Masters the most pressure-packed tournament in golf, the pressure couldn't be any greater as Woods makes his return after a leave of absence. Rate of Vibration (ROV): A performer's ROV is made up of energy, enthusiasm, confidence, belief and clarity. The higher the ROV, the more capable the performer can work through the pressure or task in front of him. Think back over the years to how many seemingly impossible situations Tiger Woods has managed to conquer. It's because he knows how to raise his ROV at will. If you were to measure Tiger's ROV this week on a scale of 1 to 1,000, I guarantee you it would be close to tipping the scales. Tiger Woods is a comeback artist: A bet against a champion is always a bad bet. When amateurs quickly become demoralized by setback and defeat, the pros know that large scale success is based on a series of comebacks. Setbacks are setups for comebacks. Tiger Woods has comeback from one setback after another. He knows how to win, and he knows how to win at Augusta.  Tiger Woods is prepared to win: Most people seem to have a strategy of ""Ready, fire, aim!"" They fail to do the necessary preparation and planning it takes to succeed. As we heard him say in his press conference, he has worked his butt off and he's been thinking about winning. Champions like Tiger Woods are always charting and changing their course to be certain everything is on track. Tiger didn't just come to Augusta because it was the popular thing to do. He wouldn't have showed up if he wasn't ready to win. He came to win and he's prepared to win. Woods said, ""I feel like my game is finally ready to compete at the highest level."" The time is now and the setting is perfect. Who will last year's champion Bubba Watson put the green jacket on in historic Butler Cabin on Sunday afternoon? It might very well be Tiger Woods."

Bruce Rauner speaks at a news conference in Chicago. A bipartisan agreement to plug a $1.6 billion budget hole including more than $1.3 billion in fund transfers from a variety of sources to avert shutdowns of Illinois state programs and services was signed into law by Gov. Rauner on Thursday, March 26, 2015. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f1822100002501c96dab.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Illinois Gov. Bruce Rauner (R) has decided the state will no longer help pay for poor people's funerals to reduce a $1.6 billion budget shortfall. The Illinois Funeral & Burial Benefits program cost the state $9.5 million in the 2014 fiscal year. The state won't reimburse indigent residents for funerals and burials after Jan. 15, according to the Illinois Department of Human Services. The program will be discontinued altogether next year as part of a wide range of social services and public health cuts. ""We didn’t arrive at any of these decisions lightly,"" department spokeswoman Veronica Vera said an in interview. ""We needed to make tough choices to balance the budget, so we needed to determine what grants could be suspended to preserve core services.""The Funeral & Burial Benefits program served 8,649 poor in the last fiscal year, Vera said, likely covering just a portion of funeral costs. The program offered up to $1,103 for funerals and $552 for cremations or burials for people who qualified for certain federal and state welfare programs at the time of their deaths. Eligible Illinois residents have a year to submit claims for funeral and burial costs incurred from October through mid-January. The average funeral cost $7,045 in 2012, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. Discontinuing the burial benefit means struggling Illinoisans will have to pay more on their own. ""We as funeral directors are really going to have to put it back on the client’s family,"" Jay Markwell, president of the Illinois chapter of funeral directors, said in an interview. Not everybody will be able to pay. When Rauner's Democratic predecessor as governor, Pat Quinn, temporarily halted the indigent funeral benefits program, Markwell said, ""Morgues that held deceased human remains, they just filled up."" Dan Brady, a funeral director who also is a Republican member of the state legislature, told the Quad-City Times he was surprised by the funeral benefit cut. He had voted in favor of a plan to close the $1.6 billion budget gap, but didn't realize Rauner would trim funeral assistance. ""I was not anticipating having this type of situation,"" he said.Rauner is touring the state promoting a reform agenda he calls ""the Illinois turnaround.""""We have a moral duty to have an efficient government,"" Rauner told the Chicago Tribune on Tuesday. ""The tax money belongs to the taxpayers. It doesn't belong to the bureaucracy. And government is not a welfare system.""Government assistance for indigent burials varies by state, according to the National Funeral Directors Association. In some states, like Illinois, the state oversees funding. In others, like California, counties control the funds. Elsewhere, indigent burial assistance falls to towns and municipalities. In some states, there is no government burial assistance at all. "

Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate in Boston -- named in honor of perhaps history's greatest advocate for federal funding of cancer research -- a day after President Obama and Vice President Biden helped to inaugurate it. The second was the public television premiere of ""The Emperor of All Maladies,"" a new documentary based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning book of the same name that is a ""biography of cancer"", tracing the path of our history with the disease while profiling the scientists, researchers, doctors, and patients who have dedicated their lives to beating it.These two disparate events are representative of a partnership that has saved the lives of millions of people -- a partnership that is currently in danger of fraying and possibly being destroyed. Just as cancer isn't fought with a single weapon and relies instead on effective combinations of treatments -- this drug, and that therapy -- to make progress, our larger societal fight against cancer is no exception. It is the partnership between our political leaders on one hand, and the dedicated medical and scientific professionals on the other, that marshals, supports, and directs our fight against this disease.Thanks to federally funded research grants, we have made astounding progress in understanding the complexities of cancer. We can, for instance, recognize and treat the nuances between different cancers. We can target cancerous cells while leaving healthy cells intact. We can monitor cell growth and manage side effects better than ever. We can even envision a cure. Thanks to this partnership, we are on the verge of genetic therapies and next-generation technologies that may tip the scales in our favor.Yet, inexplicably, this partnership is in danger of being weakened at the moment of our greatest hope for a cure. Adjusted for inflation, the current budget for the National Institutes of Health, which leads America's research against cancer, is 22 percent lower than it was in 2003. Fran Collins, the director of NIH, has said that while the NIH used to fund one in every three research proposals, there is now only enough money to fund one in every six. In 2013, the NIH awarded 640 fewer research grants than the year before. In 2014, NIH research funding for cancer was $56 million less than it was in 2010.This means we now have to fight for increased funding at a time when potentially monumental breakthroughs are in our grasp. In the war against cancer we've had to open up a second front. It is forcing some researchers who trained in the U.S. to take their talents abroad. A survey last year of research scientists found that nearly 20 percent would consider taking their research to another country including China, which is increasing its research spending even while the U.S. cuts back. Hopefully, the tide is turning. President Obama's 2016 budget calls for an additional $1 billion in NIH funding. It would push the agency's budget to its highest level ever, which, when adjusted for inflation, would bring our country back to the level we achieved in real dollars in 2010. While the president's budget still has to go through the gauntlet of a Republican-controlled Senate and House of Representatives -- at a time when House leaders have proposed cutting the discretionary budget from which NIH draws its funding by $44 billion in 2017, $64 billion in 2018 and $72 billion in 2019 -- it's possible the White House will have an unlikely ally in this fight: congressional Republicans.At a recent Stand up to Cancer event, Rep. Matt Salmon, a well-known Republican budget hawk, advocated for a $6 billion increase in NIH funding over the next two years -- proposing that $1 billion of that increase go to the National Cancer Institute. He was topped, moments later, by fellow fiscal conservative Representative Kevin Yoder, who asked why we aren't doubling NIH funding saying, ""I think I can go to my 16-month old daughter and I can say, 'I borrowed money in your name to cure cancer' and she would thank me."" It is a sentiment that Senator Kennedy would have understood well. In 1971, he became the first member of the United States Congress to introduce legislation that became known as the ""War on Cancer,"" which doubled our nation's commitment to fighting the disease. For the senator, this war was personal. All three of his children were stricken by cancer at various points in their lives. While his sons survived, his daughter Kara eventually succumbed to the disease. In 2009, just months after he sponsored a modernization of his landmark 1971 legislation, called the 21st Century Cancer ALERT Act, the senator himself died of brain cancer. Senator Kennedy's passion in the fight against cancer was greatly influenced by his constituents. After all, the Massachusetts state capital is mere miles away from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute -- whose doctors, among many others, are profiled in the ""Emperor of All Maladies."" That an institute dedicated to Senator Kennedy was inaugurated the same day as a film about his most passionate cause premiered is a coincidence, yes, but it couldn't be more fitting.Because at this very moment, the president's budget, and the increase in NIH funding it proposes, are being debated in Congress -- which is to say, the future of cancer research and the strength of the partnership between the political and medical community are being debated as well. As someone who has participated in the fight against cancer for decades -- who worked for nearly two decades in the same hospital and with the same doctors featured in the film -- I know more than most that there are no sure things. One of the most difficult things about treating cancer is that ""cancer"" actually refers to a wide variety of diseases. Every diagnosis and every treatment are maddeningly different.To me, what makes cancer so destructive isn't out of control cell growth, or malignancy, but its ability to eat away at hope. For too many people, when they hear a diagnosis of cancer, they hear an irrevocable death sentence. Cancer is shrouded in fear and mystery, so patients don't go to the doctor. They don't explore new avenues for treatment. They lose hope. But they don't have to. We don't have a cure for cancer -- yet. But we're gaining ground. The chance of surviving cancer -- from even five years ago -- has risen greatly. There is more hope today than ever before. But we can do more, starting with the current Congressional debate. Now is the time for every member of the scientific community to raise our voices and make sure we are using every tool at our disposal. We must educate Members of Congress about the incredible breakthroughs that are within our grasp. We must call on our elected officials to be good partners and finish the job we began. Senator Kennedy never lived to see the publication of ""The Emperor of All Maladies,"" although his spirit is visible in every chapter of the past fifty years. He would no doubt express amazement, as the book and film show, that the first medical description of cancer was written in an Egyptian text in 2,500 B.C. It described ""a bulging tumor in the breast ... like touching a ball of wrappings."" When turning to treatment, the ancient author noted, ""(There) is none."" We have it within our power today to change that answer. In this debate -- at this inflection point between life-saving progress and fatal inertia -- the choice is obvious: the more research we fund, the closer we get to a cure. Forty-five hundred years is long enough. Let's finish this journey once and for all."

13,RELIGION,Contemplating Islamic Reform,"Muqtedar Khan, ContributorProfessor of Islam and Global Affairs, The University of Delaw...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/contemplating-islamic-reform_b_7001202.html,"The Muslim World is unhealthy in body, spirit and mind. We need to revive and reform left, right and center.

(Prophet Muhammad pbuh from Sahih Muslim)The concomitant usage of the two terms Islam and Reform constitutes a major trope in the discourse on Islam today. Every one, from Irshad Manji to Tariq Ramadan, is a self styled reformer, seeking to reform Islam. It is really not clear what anyone really means by Islamic reform anymore. The term often says more about the political postures of those who use it than Islam or reform. Therefore any conversation that seeks to address this issue must begin by defining, and specially so, proscribing the content and scope of the term so that it may once again regain its salience. Revival and reform are Islamic TraditionsThe ideas of tajdid (renewal) and Islah (reform) are neither new nor unusual to Islamic thought . The advent of Islam - the message and mission of Prophet Muhammed pbuh - itself can be seen as a divine endeavor to revive Abrahamic monotheism and reform the then extant society and culture from jahiliyyah to Islam. This philosophy of reform and renewal is a recurrent theme in Islamic intellectual and political history. Al-Ghazzali, Ibn Taymiyyah, Abdul Wahhab, Shah Waliullah, Muhammed Abdu, Maulana Maududi, and now Abdullah Al-Naim, and Tariq Ramadan have all sought to revive and reform.As far as Muslim intellectuals who cared about the condition of Muslim reality were concerned, they sought to revive Islam in order to reform Muslim society. But today we live in an age, when Muslims and non-Muslims are talking about reforming Islam to revive Muslim societies. While the new, reversed juxtapositioning of revival and reform, is gaining dominance the old theme of revival continues to echo in the collective Muslim consciousness. If one were permitted to use a broad brush, one could argue that those who are described as Islamists are still talking about revival, and those who are described as Islamic modernists, are pushing for Islamic reform. Then there is the West, and its incessant demands on Muslims to change, and Islam to reform. Except for a few voices that are politically neutral that call for reform, most of Western demands are political even if the substance of their critique of Islam and Muslim realities is meaningful. Western demands range from the ridiculous (mosques without minarets) to profound (reforming Muslim conceptions of shariah to become in tune with the age of nation states and positivist legal regimes normatively concerned with human rights, equity and equality). Concerned Muslim intellectuals must engage with this critique to understand it, but not use it as the primary motivation to reconstitute our understanding of Islam or reformulate Muslim institutions. Western criticism must be treated as informative but not instructive of Muslim initiatives for reform.Reform and Revival is NecessaryThe only reason why Muslims need to contemplate reform is if there is a normative dissatisfaction with Muslim reality. The purpose of reform therefore will be to restore justice, virtue, and compassion to Muslim conditions. The normative ill health could be a consequence of unhealthy institutional practices (institutions like state, judiciary, university, civil society), thereby necessitating societal reform, or because of an intellectual decline. Intellectual decline that Muslim societies can face is either a decline in its ability to understand and translate the Islamic message from its sources into meaningful and salutary practice, or a decline in the processes of epistemology -- knowledge retention, production and dissemination. This would necessitate a reform in the existing dysfunctional epistemological regimes and revival and rejuvenation of the spirit of Ijtihad.In the light of contemporary Muslim realities, without delving too much into empirical discussion, I submit that neither the normative realities of the Muslim world are healthy nor is the intellectual condition of the Ummah comforting. We live in an age of sickness. The Muslim World is unhealthy in body, spirit and mind. We need to revive and reform left, right and center.What Can We Do?What I mean by reform is simple. I am calling for a critical re-visitation of Islamic sources and Islamic intellectual heritage. I am also calling for a renewed appreciation of the tremendous intellectual diversity in Islamic thought and a recognition that the development and dissemination of Islamic thought has suffered a truncated history as a consequence of global political developments, the most prominent of which have been the decline of Muslim society and the impact of colonial domination. To actually talk of Islamic reform or revival in a global sense is a bit far fetched in this age and time when diversities of culture, nationality and intellectual predilections are so vast. There are over a billion and a half Muslims in literally millions of communities all over and there is no single politburo of Islam, like the Vatican is for the Catholics, where doctrinal reforms can be made, legitimized, codified and even enforced. The difficulty that the Pope is having with his agenda of tolerance is indicative of the difficulty even when such a centralized authority does exist.  What then can we do? We need to adopt split strategic. As Muslim we develop a global consciousness that revival and reform are necessary. Many Islamic movements have already impressed upon the fact that revival is necessary but only modernist Muslims like Sir Syed Ahmad Khan and Muhammad Abduh have called for reforms. The acceptance that reform is necessary will create the space for Muslim thinkers to think critically and reevaluate our heritage. There will be more opportunities for scholars to think and write freely. At the moment many Muslim scholars are afraid literally for their lives. The case of Javed Ghamidi of Pakistan is an illustrative example. He had to flee Pakistan in order to continue his work. But actual reforms can and must take place locally. Local communities must do what is best for their spiritually and socio-political well being and act accordingly. We already see such reforms all across the Muslim world. We need more serious, more rapid and more systemic reforms than the episodic and occasionally ones we are currently experiencing. This article was first published in the Turkey Agenda."

Same-sex marriage which remains banned in over a dozen states and is subject to various limitations in others.Having dodged the issue several times before on procedural grounds, many scholars think the prospect of the high court approving of same sex marriage is very likely. They are mistaken. It is far more likely that the Court will decide after argument that review or certiorari, as it is called in Supreme Court practice, had been improvidently granted, and the case will be dismissed and concluded without opinion.Pope Francis meet Chief Justice John Roberts. Both men have a reputation -- at the last minute -- for rescuing their respective organizations from reaching beyond its practical or prudential capabilities. While as a matter of theology, few (if any) topics are beyond papal insight, and believers hold optimistically and tenaciously to the reminder in scripture that nothing is impossible with Christ, Pope Francis has had a very good run so far not overplaying infallibility. Indeed, it is fair to say that no single papal address or homily has yet to have the popular impact of his casual rhetorical response to a reporter's question seeking his view on homosexual persons. Asked about whether a homosexual person may become a priest, Francis responded:""Who am I to judge a gay person of goodwill who seeks the Lord?"" the pontiff said, speaking in Italian. ""You can't marginalize these people."" The comment is being studied by the Church's Congregation of the doctrine of faith (CDF), and not surprisingly, Francis has opposition there -- after all, in the late 1980s, the CDF under the direction of Pope John Paul II and then-Cardinal Ratzinger (now Pope-emeritus Benedict XVI),  continued to refer to homosexuality as ""disordered,"" and called for opposition even to laws that would protect homosexuals from discrimination. It is well-known that the Catholic Church still stands foursquare against same-sex marriage, even as it tries to express compassion for homosexual persons. Of course, still in the art of Easter, the ultimate statement of compassion is that of Christ himself who on the cross called upon his father, saying, ""Forgive them father for they know not what they do."" Like Francis, Jesus's call to his father at the moment of his death was truly nonjudgmental. If a culture does not ""know what they [viz. ""we""] do,"" one would think there might be a need not to be too quick to write into law a particular view. I explore the importance of avoiding the extremes of imposed sectarianism or coerced secularism in a new book soon available from Oxford Press, but one of its essential points is that for judges to write into the law of the Constitution a view that was either pro-or-anti-gay misconceives the judicial function and provokes resentment from the disfavored side in ways that democratic choice for one side or other does not. Moreover, the same-sex issue is arguably way beyond the judicial pay grade. Yes, Supreme Court justices have an obligation to make sure that government benefits and operations are conducted with equality (e.g., as the Supreme Court rightly decided in the earlier decision U.S. v. Windsor, it is profoundly unjust to exempt traditional couples from the estate tax while heavily taxing same-sex couples. But conducting government business in an even handed way is far different than pronouncing same-sex and traditional couples to be culturally equal. They may be. But the members of the Supreme Court are not trained anthropologists or demographers. Similarly, it is not surprising that Francis prior to his papacy pronounced the same-sex marriage issue is primarily one of anthropology. Thus far, the Court and the Pope have been sensitive to prudential limits. Taking the same sex case might not have at first triggered the alarm alerting the justices to the risk of over extension, but the latest religion freedom wars have now put them on notice.Neither side in the latest scuffle over religious freedom can be characterized as observing the virtue of prudence -- although if people looked, they would have discovered that the Pope had something to say on this topic. In particular, Francis was careful not to say that his church was silent on the matter, but like many Americans, he does think one's sexual practice ought not to be the constant chatter of public discussion. Nor does he seem comfortable with the lobbyist-role being played by some of his American bishops. For example, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops have been advocating same-sex marriage bans in the view that same gender marriages are not procreative and they lack complementarity. The bishops have no particularly insightful answer explaining why under Catholic teaching, marriage is made available to the infertile but not same-sex couples nor do they do much to explain complementarity beyond referring to obscure writing in philosophical journals that basically amounts to a high brow version of an appreciation for the differences in human anatomy.So the American bishops have been anything but silent, and frankly, I cannot understand how all this lobbying relates to their training as bishops or the work they obviously need to do to help me and others like me not lose the eternal life earned for me by our Lord and Savior. As Pope Francis writes: priests and bishops may be asked for their advice, but they do ""not have the right to force anything on anyone's private life. If God, in creation, ran the risk of making us free, who am I to get involved? We condemn spiritual harassment that takes place when a minister imposes directives, conduct, and demands in such a way that it takes away the freedom of the other person. God left the freedom to sin in our hands. One has to speak very clearly about values, limits, commandments, but spiritual and pastoral harassment is not allowed."" You got to love this guy.Of course, the pro-gay side makes claims of anthropological similarity and trots out various studies showing gays to be equally good parents and so forth. Indeed, Indiana at one time - before it got tarred and feathered for passing virtually the same law as every other state touching on the topic of religious freedom when the world's focus was elsewhere - had one of the most judicially honest reasons for why a state might reserve marriage for heterosexuals. The reason: because unlike homosexual couples that spend a fortune trying to have children by artificially assisted means and thereby exhibit a truly positive commitment to child rearing, a good many heterosexuals are irresponsibly spreading their seed across the Hoosier landscape, and everywhere else, but are nowhere around for child rearing and related expenses. Marriage licenses were a rational means to at least get some pertinent address information for when those needs arise. Hey, Walmart and Angie's list, do you really support absentee husbands and irresponsible family planning?If all this cultural doubt wasn't enough, maybe before Justice Kennedy gets out his dictionary of Hallmark rhetoric -- which I for one enjoy -- waxing eloquent about intimacy of any type (and in the right context and place, rhetoric that can be quite inspirational so long as the Court's opinion foregoes putting into its pages those awful music makers found in greeting cards) maybe a little attention ought to be paid to how those with homosexual orientation are said to struggle with their own identity. Admittedly, this struggle could merely be a reaction to the incessant chatter about the topic or their status.Okay, admitting the sociological or anthropological nature of the issue, isn't there some law on the subject? Sure there is. But it's not law that the US Supreme Court is uniquely empowered to apply. Indeed, it is state and local police power that is being interpreted and the whole idea of a Federalist Republic is that the states get to pass and interpret their own laws... So if the justices want to say something after the argument other than ""whoops wrong case,"" they can all shout in unison: ""hooray for federalism"" and go on vacation. And in that happy event, the one salutary by-product of all the huffing and puffing over Governor Pence's loss for words will be his contribution to the reinvigoration of the Tenth Amendment. What is the likely interpretation at the state and local level? Just this, that those who turn their gay and lesbian neighbors away from a wedding cake or a dance hall or any service supplied by a private entity that holds itself open to the public, and thus effaces or denigrates a gay or lesbian human being is most likely running afoul of public accommodation laws going back generations into the common law. The fact that anyone could conceive of discriminating over these humdrum matters as a principled defense of religious freedom sadly reveals the meanness of the present age. That said, there has been recent judicial misdirection here and taking the same sex case in disregard of the limits of the judicial role or the structural protection of federalism is arguably a byproduct of overextended claims of religious freedom that the Catholic Church and other conservative faiths aided and abetted in the Hobby Lobby case (women employees can be denied access to health care involving contraception disapproved by the owners of a private, closely held business.) Those contraception's were disapproved because the plaintiffs sincerely believed them to be abortifacients. Whether they were or not is open to question, but at least the Court could be seen as being sympathetic on the issue of protecting human life which arguably ought to weigh more than defending the churlish right to not bake a cake or take a photo. Why the Court would want to reach out for another opportunity to coerce one set of Americans over another set of Americans is baffling enough without having to explain why the justices would jump at an opportunity to take a position of the bad guy - or at least an extremely hypersensitive merchant at the margins of moral theology. (Catholic theologians have a very elaborate, and ultimately indecipherable and unconvincing, theory of moral cooperation that it cheapens when it extends it to denials of service by public accommodations).  As I see it, coming to the aid of such discrimination only reinforces that Christ was not speaking narrowly when he asked his father to forgive them. And this most definitely is not a one-sided criticism for also joining the ranks of ""them"" in need of forgiveness would be those who would so readily extend newfound protections for those of a minority sexual orientation or who would threaten to blacken the eye of reasonable efforts, be they in Indiana or elsewhere, to accommodate diverse faith traditions. Repeatedly, one hears expressions ranging from joy to sheer puzzlement at how ""we the people"" have gone from a nation of homophobes to a nation of toleration. There's often a genuine question underneath the expression of ""how did that happen?"" There is seldom a good answer given, but the beginning of one is the observation that the gay cause, if I may temporarily and inartfully call it that, advanced not by legislated or economically-threatened force, but by neighbors getting to know neighbors; by all of us seeing and knowing gay families that were acting like families have always acted - that is, caring most and sufficiently for those in their immediate household. This conception of family is an irreplaceable cultural unit, and that irreplaceability goes a good distance to explain why polygamy and other household forms of reduced accountability for the formation of discerning citizens can be differentiated even after legal obstacles to same-sex marriage are removed.The latest ""religious freedom"" war has been an embarrassment to faith. In this country, no faith has an entitlement to legal endorsement. There is no established church - and that means neither pro-gay nor anti-gay theologies or perspectives have a claim to be favored over the other.The Supreme Court was wrong to think it has a role in this matter. Advocates for same-sex marriage before the Court are making all the usual arguments: marriage, it is said, is a fundamental right and it cannot be denied; affirming traditional heterosexual marriage requires affirming its homosexual counterpart; and the comeuppance of them all: it is simply irrational to draw distinctions in the law on the basis of sexual preference. These arguments are best heard in the states where particular limitations, if any, can be separately considered and likely passed upon initially by means of initiative or referendum by the people of the state.Taken separately, each of the arguments can be supported because each has a measure of sense to it. But it is only a partial measure of sense, since each argument is only partially right, and here is why: there is no constitutional basis to prefer religious freedom over freedom from gender-based discrimination or vice versa. This is not the first time two civil liberties contested for preference against the other. Thus, the Supreme Court correctly held thirty years ago that religious freedom could not immunize racial discrimination. Having fought a bloody civil war and thrice amended the Constitution to get the tarnish of slavery out of the document, the Court was not about to give legal sanction to a new ""badge of slavery."" By comparison, it was analytically a closer question whether the Court correctly denied a Mormon religious freedom claim to practice polygamy. No one fought a civil war for the right to have multiple wives, and it was open to debate what the sociological effects of polygamy might be, though there is reason to worry about subordination and associated forms of marital abuse.Matters of religious faith should not be taken up by a secular Supreme Court too easily or prematurely. That is especially true when the contending sides seek the force of law to coerce the belief of the other. The Supreme Court of United States should deny further review and pronounce that its grant of certiorari had been improvidently extended. Failing to do so, I fear, will only produce a result much in need of forgiveness. There will be difficult cases ahead here, especially those related to auxiliary services run by religious organizations who will want to maintain the consistency of their teaching in church as well as school. This will again put in play the extent to which ministers and other religious leaders and teachers are exempted from the general civil rights statutes. This is what Gov. Pence was attempting to defend, and people who are normally on the side of religious freedom knew that very well, and yet it was reminiscent of the 1950s and the red scare, to watch how many people walked by the governor without lending a hand as he was being pummeled by gay advocates seeking to coerce dissenting religions. And again I for one am going to think twice before going back to Walmart because no matter how many greeters they have, Walmart was no friend of freedom in this matter. But I suppose if Jesus can forgive me, Walmart deserves my understanding if for no other reason than volume and price."

Suffice it to say, the new mandate hasn't made anybody happy and has garnered plenty of vocal detractors (and rightly so), from US Lacrosse, the sport's national governing body (which, among other things, called the mandate ""irresponsible"" and premature), to coaches (who don't see the flimsy headband approved by FHSAA -- what one longtime game official told The Times looked ""more like a thick bandana"" -- as serving any purpose and no more than a ""costly distraction to parents and the players""), to game officials (one told The Times that the only effect the headgear was having on the game was to cause delays because the headbands were prone to falling off) to the athletes themselves, who say all it does is get in the way of their goggles. But what I and many others continue to find perhaps most disturbing about the mandate is that it was a policy change made by FHSAA in complete disregard of the unanimous recommendation of its own Operations Committee, US Lacrosse staff, nationally renowned sport medicine doctors and the Florida lacrosse community that it hold off until performance standards for helmets were established.A lot of us in the youth sports safety community are simply scratching our heads, asking ourselves, ""Why the rush?"" As best as I or any of us can tell, it was because, as FHSAA's Executive Director, Dr. Roger Dearing, told The Times, ""The board felt it had to do something."" In other words, it was a policy decision which a slim majority of the board decided to take not in recognition of but despite the science. (A familiar occurrence these days in national politics, as well)As a former college lacrosse and high school field hockey player, and a member of ASTM International's subcommittee on standards for headgear and helmets, which is working with US Lacrosse on developing a new standard for headgear in women's lacrosse, I have reservations about whether requiring female lacrosse players to wear helmets will make the sports safer, or, as a result of the phenomenon called risk compensation (also called the ""gladiator effect""), will actually result in more, rather than fewer, head injuries.There is some evidence to suggest that such fears may be unfounded. A study on the use of protective goggles, albeit in girl's field hockey and involving different protective equipment, for instance, found that their use did not increase concussion rates, despite fears that they would lead to more aggressive play and hence more concussions. But the only way we will know is to, one, make sure that whatever helmets female lacrosse players wear meet standards that are based on science, and have been developed after a deliberative and collaborative process by an independent organization, like ASTM, which is not funded by helmet manufacturers and which does not just invite, but requires input from equipment manufacturers, product testing laboratories, researchers and governing bodies, in this case US Lacrosse; and, second, to hold off on mandating helmets in the girl's game until there is actual data to show that they help reduce concussions on which to base a policy decision. The only way to do that is by conducting pilot programs comparing injury rates for teams in which girls wear helmets meeting the new, soon-to-be-approved ASTM standard, to rates where they don't. As The Korey Stringer Institute and University of Connecticut's Doug Casa argued during his presentation at MomsTEAM Institute of Youth Sports Safety's Smart Teams Play Safe summit last year, youth sports safety policies should be developed and implemented by sports medicine professionals. The appropriate process for developing sports safety policy was summed up nicely in an email I got this week from Ann Carpenetti, vice president of lacrosse operations at US Lacrosse and co-chair of the women's lacrosse headgear task group at ASTM: US Lacrosse is committed to making evidence based decisions, and we rely heavily on expertise provided by researchers, sports medicine practitioners, educators, athletic trainers, administrators, coaches, officials, parents, [and] players to help us establish a holistic and best practices approach to keeping the sport fun and safe for all.The girl's lacrosse helmet fiasco in Florida amply demonstrates just how horribly things can and will go off track when that process isn't followed and when politics trumps science."

Waladkewics This past Veterans Day, I posted a challenge to my fellow service members and veterans. I told them it's on us. It is our responsibility to be as prepared as possible when we make that jump from the military to the civilian world. And in challenging them, I also challenged myself. I set a goal for me and my team to reach as many service members as possible with this message: take control of your transition.Through my work with Toyota and Hiring Our Heroes, I have seen a lot of veterans find jobs, start businesses, and go back to school after the military. Unfortunately, I have also seen veterans who were unprepared for the transition and faced uncertainty about their futures. I realized that all of the resources we were sharing with these veterans needed to be shared with current members of the military who would soon be in their shoes. The sooner we reached them, the easier their transitions would be. I sat down with both teams, and together we developed a tactical transition workshop geared towards service members 12 to 18 months from getting out. Having faced my own post-military frustrations, I have worked for years since then with veterans facing the same issues. What are the things I wish I had known when I got out? That question drove the creation of the Hiring Our Heroes Education Tour, a nationwide effort to get our service members thinking early and seriously about their next steps. I am pleased to report that we launched the 2015 HOH Education Tour earlier this month to more than 470 Marines at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune and Marine Corps Air Stations New River and Cherry Point. After the first opening question, I knew we were onto something: ""What scares you most when I say the phrase -- life after the military? Take a minute and write down the first few things that come to mind."" It took more than a minute, but those pens started scribbling down the same fears and uncertainties I knew well. By the end of each class, these service members may not have had all of the answers to their questions, but we gave them the tools they needed to figure it out.Working with my co-trainer, TSgt. Virginia Brewer, we focused on helping each Marine better understand the value of his or her military experience and build that into a strong personal brand. We made sure they understood the different paths open to them in the civilian world: employment, education, entrepreneurship. Still, the call to own their transition and take responsibility for their lives was clear. These were opportunities they had earned, but they had to be ready to seize them. In my mind, we were briefing them for the next fight -- and it is a fight. Although the employment situation for veterans has improved since I left the military, the most recent report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics tells me we still have work to do. The unemployment rate for post-9/11 veterans remains above the national average and more than doubles for veterans under the age of 25. Every man and woman who has honorably worn the uniform of this country has the ability to make our nation stronger. I know because they already have. Last week, I shared my message with 60 more Marines at Quantico and soon the tour will head west to reach service members stationed at Miramar and Twentynine Palms in California. There, and at every stop after, our goal is simple: to give these men and women as much runway as possible, so they can not only have a smooth transition into the civilian workforce, but use their training and their skills to take our country to the next level."

Mike Pence provided official sanction for such acts of oppression when he signed a gay-bashing version of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It enabled individuals and businesses to legally claim their faith required hateful acts of intolerance. Pence got all huffy when human rights groups accused him of seeking to change the state’s slogan from Hoosier Hospitality to Hoosier Hostility.Marriage-equality-hating Indiana Republicans were joined by counterparts in Arkansas, North Carolina and Georgia in advancing government-sanctioned discrimination. This is not the way Americans treat each other. Well, not in 2015 anyway. America traveled down the path of intolerance for too many centuries. Now, Americans look back at all-white lunch counters with shame. Despite anxiety about ISIS, they disapprove of blaming terrorism on all Muslims. Americans aren’t perfect inclusive egalitarians. But they’re trying. On a deeply spiritual level, they hate institutionalization of minority hate.  Indiana Gov. Mike Pence by DonkeyHotey on FlickrAnd that’s what was going on in Indiana, Arkansas, North Carolina and Georgia. Bans on marriage equality have failed. So these states tried to crash those ceremonies by denying the couples wedding flowers and cakes, then cloaking that vicious discrimination in a sheepskin of religiosity.The federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, passed in 1993, was intended to protect religious practices from unnecessary government intrusion. For example, it prevented a Louisiana school district from requiring that a Rastafari student cut his hair because a tenet of his religion is that men should grow long dreadlocks. The new-fangled versions of this law pushed and passed by Republicans this year, however, added clauses to provide individuals and businesses that unlawfully discriminate with protection from lawsuits alleging unlawful discrimination. These laws would, for example, enable a pizza shop owner to assert that his religion requires him to deny service to long-haired Rastafarians or to same-sex couples holding hands while waiting in line.Gay rights activists, human rights advocates and righteous Americans protested. They didn’t want to face government-sanctioned discrimination. They didn’t want their friends or family or even strangers to face government-sanctioned discrimination.Gov. Pence and the Republicans in the Arkansas, North Carolina and Georgia legislatures ignored these protests. And virtually every Republican seeking the party’s presidential nomination – Jeb Bush, Ted Cruz, Bobby Jindal, Ben Carson and Rick Santorum – voiced support for the governors and their license to discriminate laws.The Republican governors backpedaled only when they heard the giant sucking sound of business and convention dollars draining from their states. Similarly, former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer, also a Republican, rejected a license to discriminate law last year only after the National Football League and corporations threatened negative consequences she’d not anticipated.Companies including Apple, Angie’s List, NASCAR, Gap Inc., Levi Strauss & Co., Eli Lilly, Marriott, Subaru and Salesforce condemned Indiana’s anti-gay law or threatened to cancel expansion planned for Indiana. The NCAA, headquartered in Indianapolis, expressed concern about government-sanctioned Hoosier Hostility to players, coaches and fans. In the countdown to the Final Four games in Indianapolis, basketball coaches, professional athletes and former Olympians censured Indiana, threatened to boycott the state and demanded repeal of the law. Cities and states from Connecticut to Washington that protect the rights of LGBT Americans forbid taxpayer-funded to travel to Indiana. Celebrities, bands and comedians canceled visits and concerts.In Arkansas, Walmart, based in Bentonville, told Gov. Asa Hutchinson the anti-gay bill “does not reflect the values we uphold.” After the state’s largest employers urged a veto, Hutchinson reversed his earlier promise to sign and sought removal of the discriminatory language. Pence, who’d arranged for three anti-gay activists – Micah Clark, Eric Miller, and Curt Smith – to stand behind him as he signed Indiana’s bill, supported amendments to prevent the likes of Memories Pizza from demanding certification of heterosexuality before service.This sudden change of heart – and the revisions to the Indiana and Arkansas legislation – created some awkward moments for the Republican presidential candidates who’d already supported the anti-gay laws. Bush flip-flopped just like the governors did. One day he was for discrimination, the next he wasn’t.Apparently recognition of LGBT rights by the majority of Americans – and American businesses – occurred much too quickly for Republicans.Admittedly, the labor movement hasn’t always honored equal rights as quickly as it should have. But AFSCME was among those that pulled a convention out of Indiana in protest of the anti-gay law, and the labor movement has made a concerted effort in recent years to establish true solidarity among all its diverse members.My own union has failed at times to meet standards to which it aspires. But last summer, at the USW convention, the membership voted to make it an offense under the union constitution to harass a member on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity. The USW will not tolerate any form of discrimination against anyone in its ranks for any reason. It has no place in our union.Like the USW, the United States is a union. It is a collection of diverse states and diverse people. Standing together, they are stronger.Republicans who supported codifying intolerance need to experience a conversion. Such hostility has no place in the land of Hoosiers. It should find no home in the land of the free. "

I'm always gonna wanna make it move. Always gonna be an uphill battle. Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose. Ain't about how fast I get there. Ain't about what's waitin' on the other side. It's the climb.Note to presidential candidates: Come up with a more appropriate metaphor for the next federal educational initiative. The current one is ridiculous at best. Just what were the planners and handlers thinking when they came up with the name for the largest national education initiative in history? Race to the Top? C'mon. The phenomena of racing and reaching the top couldn't possibly have been the goals set for children's education. Anyone who knows anything about the fragile, unpredictable, erratic, self-conscious development of a youngster couldn't possibly have come up with such a name. But, let's pause to reconsider the possibilities. Maybe critics of the feds should take a minute to do a close read of the name and give the planners a break. Maybe they had something else in mind. Let's try a thought experiment.What if the federal education bureaucrats were dog whistling to the rich folks to get them on board with the initiative? Maybe it's Chase to the Top for the bankers and billionaires who are in thrall with destroying public schools and privatizing education. The unrelenting attacks on teacher unions, the proliferation of charter schools, the imposition of frustrating and impossibly difficult tests (then selling products to help with testing) may seem entirely appropriate to those who reap the rewards from the market approach to schooling. Teachers bashed, children anxious, parents confused. Sounds like a plan. Maybe it's White Race to the Top. Sounds plausible since the RTTT mandates and the NCLB policies have done little to change the intractable achievement gaps, and even less to address segregated school systems, perhaps the greatest obstacle to school success. At a recent New York State legislative meeting, a meeting to coronate Governor Cuomo as the king of the New York State educational system, a courageous legislator got it right: ""High need/low wealth districts get shafted every time."" (1) This includes impoverished white communities as well.Poor people please understand. There's just so much room at the top; privileged white communities occupy the space, and there's no sign they will sub-divide. The notion that the federal and state education plans' foremost objective is to help the inner city schools and the disenfranchised is a convenient lie. Politicians are fond of citing miraculous stories of schools in poor communities improving. But these are outliers, examples of schools with unique circumstances and/or infusions of grant money. These are outliers. The politicians are just plain liars. Oh for the good ol' days when No Child Left Behind was the lead catch phrase. I pine for the compassionate conservative approach. And, remember, not only does No Child Left Behind have a sweet sound, it promises proficiency for all by 2014. I must have missed the celebration. Sounds more like No Guile Left Behind, but that's for another day. For NASCAR enthusiasts, maybe it's Race to the Pit Stop. This version borrows a page from racing's pit crews, experts at refueling, changing tires and making mechanical adjustments with lightning speed so their team car can get back on the track. Sounds eerily like the schoolhouse intervention crews who are called in to remediate the troubled and disabled kids who may not be able to successfully finish the assessment race. With the fear of failure looming over all -- students and teachers alike -- the sidelined kids are oiled, gassed up, adjusted and made ready for the hunger games.And for the merchants who sell us our goods, an apt term might be Race to the Shop. Take black Friday for example. Customers wait on line all night, rush into the store when it opens, and get 20 percent off on a toaster. Seems like a good comparison to school assessments. Students prepare for tests all year, arrive early to school to be ready, and receive a number for their efforts. They don't even get to take home an appliance.Parenthetically, the heavy-handed approach to improve achievement through standardized tests -- mainly to compete with countries like Finland -- is breathtaking in its stupidity. A recent article (2) about Finnish schools reports that the Finns are adopting more collaboration, more play, more essential real world questions in their Helsinki schools, readying the approach for all Finnish schools. Not a multiple choice question in sight.A question to consider using the United States method: Hearing of the Finnish initiative, the U.S. Secretary of Education is --  a) Wondering what an essential question is?  b) Asking his speech writers to stay late at the office? c) Calling Pearson to speed up his transition to the corporate world? d) All of the above.I've got it: Race to the Tap. There's no way that Americans can stay sober when they see their children crying and anxious. At the end of open school night, the bars are packed with red-eyed, stupefied PTA members who try to make sense of it all. Then they get tired, forget why they were upset, and the next day it starts all over again.For those who have begun calling it Just Plain Crap, they obviously have no poetic sense, and they must have listened to the remarks of David Coleman (the architect of the Common Core and now the President of the College Board) at a New York State Department of Education meeting (3). Here, verbatim, is a portion of the exchange he had with educational leaders from around the state: (And I'm not kidding).Do people know the two most popular forms of writing in the American high school today?... It is personal writing. It is either the exposition of a personal opinion or it is the presentation of a personal narrative. The only problem, forgive me for saying this so bluntly, as you grow up in this world you realize people really don't give a shit about what you feel or what you think.So now we have the metaphor that best captures the essence of the initiative:Race to the Bottom. So, Mr. or Mrs. future President, please listen carefully. If we believe that our children should get the message that other people don't care what they feel or think as they grow up, then we have turned into bottom feeders. To all those who believe that children should race as they struggle to the top, let's remember: It's not how fast we get there, It's the climb. And, forgive me for saying this so bluntly, we don't give a shit what David Coleman feels or thinks.References 1. Tedisco Challenges Gov.

Fortunately for him, Aaron's lawyer knows that the judge is a big fan of a meditation instructor named Rachel played by Kristen Kerr from ""Strictly Sexual."" Egotistical and skeptical Aaron must learn mindfulness meditation from Rachel in order to impress the judge and get his sentence reduced. In their sessions together, Rachel tries to teach Aaron basic Buddhism and both characters end up learning valuable lessons.Surprisingly, Harry Hamlin turns in a stellar performance as the womanizing Aaron and has quite good chemistry with Ms. Kerr, whose Rachel is very typical of many of my fellow meditation teachers. John Wellwood famously said, ""There is no spiritual bypass;"" although Rachel is a gifted teacher she has not done her psychological homework so she does not walk the talk. Part love story, part meditation guide book, ""The Fourth Noble Truth"" is an intelligent, thought-provoking film about how mindfulness can change your life - similar to the way ""The Razor's Edge"" opened new doors for me thirty years ago.

The eighth season of ""The Big Bang Theory"" comes to a close on May 7. Two days before that, Parsons will step onto the Broadway stage to play the Almighty in ""An Act of God,"" which runs for 13 weeks. If you're feeling extra ambitious, make that a triple-header with ""Home."" Currently in theaters, DreamWorks' animated movie, in which a teenager (voiced by Rihanna) helps Parsons' lonely extraterrestrial, named Oh, adjust to life on Earth, debuted at No. 1 after opening on March 27. That doesn't leave the 42-year-old actor with much blank space on his calendar, but somewhere in there he'll need to squeeze in an Emmy campaign, in hopes of collecting his fifth statue for portraying Sheldon Cooper. HuffPost Entertainment caught up with Parsons in between the avalanche to ask how he balances it all.Memorizing all the science jargon Sheldon says on ""The Big Bang Theory"" can't be easy, and now you have all this biblical talk to learn, too. Does it become overwhelming?  It’s a funny thing. I have a couple more episodes to shoot and then in the past month two months I’ve been doing all this press for the animated movie “Home.” Every moment I have a chance to drink coffee in the morning or a moment to read, I’m like, “You should probably run some lines. You should run, you know, the ninth commandment or whatever.” So these weird quotes and these weird phrasings just run through my head -- “thou art” and “thou shalt” and things like that. It’s a weird place where one might need therapy afterwards. It can be tough to deal with the Sheldon stuff, some more than others. I will say the blessing of the television show is that you only have to know it once and you can take a few takes to do it. The frightening part, and the invigorating part, but frightening-before-you-do-it part, of theater is that it’s one night and one night only as far as that crowd witnessing the story that night. But certainly a television show and doing 24 episodes in nine months, you have five days with each one and you’re just never, ever gong to know it at that level that you can know something you’re doing at the theater.You can probably get by without fully understanding everything Sheldon is saying, but is reading the Bible part of your God preparations? Well, with the Sheldon stuff -- the science stuff -- the strongest part of my research would be just learning to pronounce things, and secondarily I do always make a passing effort at trying to figure out what the hell this might represent. But there are times that it is literally gibberish to me and I just hope I’m putting my inflection in a place that makes it sound sort of like I know what I’m talking about. The God stuff is actually a lot easier to understand. You may not want to always, but it really seems to be easier. Party because I took a lot more God, if you will, than I took science in my lifetime because I was raised going to church every Sunday. So we don’t touch on anything in this play that is unfamiliar to me. In fact, I think it’s been more about touching on things where I go, “My, I haven’t thought about that in a long time.” Old stories from the Bible come up. So in that way, no. The biggest thing I’ve done so far is make sure I have really strict in my head the precise definitions of “omnipotent,” “omniscient” and “omnipresent” because they come up several times and every once in a while, when I’m running through all these lines, I’m like, “Wait wait wait, which one of the O’s is this?” And it helps to remember exactly what each of those is. I mean, I know what they are, but every once in a while you’re like, “Shit, is it 'omnipresent' or 'omniscient' right now? Hmm.” Context is everything. On top of that, there are a couple of minor characters, but this is pretty much a one-man show. Yeah, these angels, frankly, should be talking a lot more than they are. So there. Do you have a favorite fictional God? The heavyweight God for me is Morgan Freeman, having a lot to do with that voice. That being said, emotionally the first one I always think of is George Burns. Those movies were playing on TV and on HBO when I was young, so he was really my first God to encounter from Hollywood. And he was such a dear old man, or at least I felt that way when I was watching as a child. I thought, “Thank you, what a lovely God.” Had you and Rihanna met before working on ""Home""? God, no. We never would have had that chance. I guess I could have gone to a concert, but I don’t know. I don’t know if I even could have worked my way backstage, but no. That didn’t happen, so we didn’t meet until we did the movie.Jennifer Lopez has a role in ""Home,"" too, so you were essentially living in pop-star land. Were all three of you in the studio at the same time? No, it would have exploded. We really weren’t though. Most of the time we had to record alone. I think it’s a lot easier for them to get our recordings alone. I also think, scheduling-wise, they do it that way. But no, we never worked together. Being your first animated movie, did you find yourself still concocting mannerisms and facial expressions for the character? And do they factor into the actual movie? They do factor in, but they really were concocted accidentally. It was a very interesting experience to be robbed of certain storytelling abilities like your body and your face. There was a certain point where the animation got more and more precise and particular, and at that point sometimes the character would make eye movements or even when his mouth would open sometimes, I’ve seen myself enough on camera to know, “That’s really, completely me,” and it would be. And I have to tell you, too, that part didn’t freak me out. In fact, I found it very joyful because the hard part was when I was watching preliminary sketches and drawings with my voice. Even actors who hear themselves a lot of the time, I think even for us there’s still the little seed of that first time you hear yourself on the tape recorder and go, “No, that’s not how I sound,” because your voice just doesn’t sound the same. So there was this double whammy of this disembodied voice but embodied through this alien that I really wasn’t comfortable with at first. They would even take lines that I remember recording and not being thrilled with, and they’d say, ""Sure, it’s fine."" Animators are the best excuse-makers in the world. They take all the rough edges off of everything that I’ve done. It was really delightful. I would jump to do another animated movie. They take a long time and you feel like you’re never going to see the full fruits of the labor, and that is a test of patience, but the process is joyful and the result of kind of heavenly. There's a cute scene where your character, Oh, starts involuntarily dancing and can't stop. What's a song that you just have to dance to if it comes on? I don’t really have one because I have enough self-control about these issues. I keep thinking that I should dance more often. Because of the movie, it keeps coming up, but I guess I just don’t dance enough. What about karaoke? I’d rather be shot in the heart. My God, it’s one of my least favorite activities on earth. I’d run away. What’s the last Rihanna song you had stuck in your head? “Please Don’t Stop the Music.” It’s such a good song. What’s the last J. Lo song you had stuck in your head? The one from the movie because I keep hearing it, “Feel the Light.” It’s the song that kind of travels through the whole movie. Amid all of this, you still have another Emmy season to gear up for. Have you kept up with the category changes, which will affect some of what ""The Big Bang Theory"" competes against this year? I heard about it happening. I will say that I think the attempt to -- I don’t even know what you call it -- the attempt to shuffle things around and try to think about what is the best place for certain work to be showcased is a good and necessary thing to put energy into. And I really do speak in that part from personal experience, both in the acting category and in the show category. I felt it very vividly last year when, and it’s been a while now, but in the actor category was me and then William H. Macy from “Shameless” and then Don Cheadle and Louis C.K. If you watch an episode of each of those shows right in a row, you really are going, “Are you kidding me? We’re asking people to compare and contrast these? What?” There will always be a bit of that, though, even in its most infantile stages, back when there were only three channels or whatever. When you’re comparing entertainment things like that, it’s always apples and oranges and carrots and celery. There are so many opportunities for writers and actors on TV right now that it is a cornucopia. It’s like being in a Thanksgiving feast as far as opportunities and choices on television, and that is 100 percent good. But when you’re talking about how to divide up an award show, it is 100 percent tricky. It’s only gotten trickier. So I guess we’ll see with the decisions they’ve already made. I don’t think you know till you do it. It is, though, a very, very good quote-unquote problem to be having. Right, I think we're on our way to figuring out how to modernize the Emmys, but I wonder if it doesn't make more sense just to split shows by half-hour and hourlong programs? Oh, that’s interesting. Absolutely. Well, and then do they decide further between cable and network? I don’t know. I hesitate to call it Pandora’s box because it’s an award show -- it’s not war. But it is the messier part of it. Again, it’s a good thing to be in. It’s just not a clean breakdown of what’s going on on the small screen anymore. So I guess if you’re going to continue to have categories, you have to figure out some sort of regulations or dividing lines."
