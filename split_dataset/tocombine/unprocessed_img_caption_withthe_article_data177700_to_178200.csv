1,DIVORCE,Overcoming Communication Barriers In Marriage & Divorce,"Lubov Stark, Esq, Contributor
Founder and Principal of Lubov Stark LLC",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/overcoming-communication_us_5b9c4347e4b03a1dcc7d6f74,"Having counseled and represented thousands of people in their divorces, it is very clear to me that quite often, marriages fail because of an innate inability to allow each other the right to think differently.",2012-09-13,A young couple sitting on a couch are having an argument,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c434724000032005321f1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Having counseled and represented thousands of people in their divorces, it is very clear to me that quite often, marriages fail because of an innate inability to allow each other the right to think differently. For many couples, it seems to come down to whether they choose to be right or choose to be happy. Couples that choose to be right (mostly subconsciously) face a marriage filled with criticism, finger pointing and a general need to defend their ego. Couples that choose to be happy have less egoist interaction and are more accepting and tolerant of each other's differences in opinions or behavior. There is an agreement that the bond between them is greater than their differences. There is a strong recurring theme for many people going through divorce: a problem with communication skills. Many married couples go through life experiencing a great deal of discord and pressure because they can't seem to communicate with one another in a productive manner.Marriage counselors and therapists help people develop constructive communication skills by calling attention to the subconscious undertones that trigger difficulties in the relationship. These undertones are a mixture of past experiences, family values and general expectations, which people rarely take the time to analyze. This analysis and the subsequent development of solid communication skills is key to a successful marriage. What exactly is communication? Communication is defined as the imparting or interchange of thoughts, opinions, or information by speech, writing, or signs. This definition clearly establishes that exchanging thoughts and opinions is the core of communication; it requires two parties to send and receive a message, which means that listening is equally important as speaking. People get into arguments because they are unable or unwilling to listen to each other freely. Marriage does not imply that two people become one; instead, individuality should survive within the union. The union will survive when couples give each other the right to maintain their own thoughts, opinions and personalities. If there is a breakdown in the relationship and the marriage does not succeed, it's important to recognize the communication problems that may have triggered the split. By stepping back and reflecting on simple human nature -- whether with a therapist, spiritual lead, or on your own -- we can extrapolate what led to the incompatibility in different areas of the relationship. Prior to filing divorce papers for new clients, I always sit down with them and discuss why they want to dissolve their marriage. Often, problems between couples can continue after the divorce papers are signed. I advise my clients to meet with professionals -- psychologists, life coaches, or religious leaders -- to refocus their energy on moving forward and reinventing themselves independently from the relationship that broke down. Once they are able to detach themselves from the negativity surrounding the divorce process, they will be able to make non-confrontational decisions and move forward with the rest of their lives. Whether going through a divorce or just dealing with everyday life, give yourself the gift of stepping outside the drama and communicating effectively in order to make better choices as you move forward."

It still looks like summer. It still feels like summer. But all of a sudden the rules change. The douchebags who so graciously departed for the Hamptons in June have returned en masse. Kids are back in school. People have to start paying attention at work again. Football makes its violent, militaristic reappearance. Those awesome seersucker and linen suits? Back in the closet for nine months. Sure, it's still warm and lush and green outside. But the waiting game has begun. When are the fall clothes going to come out of mothballs? When's the first frost? When are you going to look around and say, ""Holy crap, how did it become winter?""In a nutshell, I hate this time of year. But good booze always helps mitigate the crud factor of autumn, and this autumn there's a ton of very fine new bottlings out there. Most of them should be on your liquor store shelves by now, and the few that aren't will be launching within the next few weeks. There's something for just about everyone here, from bourbon to rum to liqueur to absinthe, and at price points ranging from $20 to $5,000. Try one or, as I did, try them all -- just not in one night. Autumn unfolds slowly, so take your time.Photo from xlibber, Flickr."

That my healthy diet is some sort of attempt at getting around, well, death.You know what helped me laugh off the comment? The sweetness with which it was delivered. There was no malice in the guy's voice. Only teasing and maybe even a little affection.You know what else helped? I'm not and never have been on a crusade to get a single person to eat the way I do. I just want to share what I'm learning for those of you who want to learn more.I once read about a guy whose big treat was one M&M a month, always on the same day of the month -- which he ate with a knife and fork. I thought it was crazy, but I couldn't get it out of my mind. It tickled my imagination.People say, ""You won't live longer eating this way. It will only feel like that."" And you know what? They're... full of it. I used to say that, too -- until I tried it. I'm richly rewarded for passing up those decadent meals. I feel so much better. Why would you want to stop feeling this good? I don't.I find so much more pleasure in the delights of my other senses, now. There's almost nothing I love more than going into a bakery and taking in the aroma. Music is a bigger treat. I've pretty much insisted any time off we take as a family involve a feast for the eyes in terms of breathtaking scenery -- which my sweethearts haven't minded one bit.And sure, for you moderators out there, it's difficult to understand why I'd need to go to such extremes and cut out cookies and donuts and stale Cheetos altogether. Don't take my word for it. Ask recovering smokers or alcoholics. Do they exempt themselves from their healthy lifestyle when out to dinner with friends on Friday evenings? Nope. It would be their undoing. It was for me.I may or may not live longer eating this way. That was never the point. The point was partly to see how much better my skin looked, and I'm not kidding -- though I'm probably digressing.I might not live longer, but I feel great. That makes passing up the French fries -- and the French toast, drizzled with so much butter and syrup even the new me pauses for a moment of wistful -- so worth it.For more on personal health, click here.For more by Maureen Anderson, click here."

He got custody of his daughter.This is the limit of conventional justice: ""victory,"" which of course means defeat for the other person, in this case, the mother of his daughter. Why not celebrate? His lawyer was satisfied. I mean, come on, you won, man!But Bill Heenan, a Chicago fireman, had the nagging feeling that his daughter was also one of the losers in the decision. The case had been dragging through Parentage and Child Support Court, one of the busiest in the Cook County Circuit Court system, for a year. The court hears child-custody and other child-related cases in which the parents were never married, a situation that may cover nearly half the kids in Chicago.""The court system is the most horrifying thing I've ever seen in my life,"" Bill told me. ""You sit there, you don't say a word. The lawyer does all the talking. Then you go out in the hallway and the lawyer explains what the judge said.""Though Bill and his daughter's mother were not married, they lived near each other in Chicago and he saw his daughter, Alyssa, every day. When she was 10, Andrea, the mother, was offered a temporary job in Hawaii. While she was there with Alyssa, she was offered a permanent position and decided to take it. Suddenly Bill, who was paying child support, was without contact with his daughter, unless he flew to Hawaii on a regular basis, something he could hardly afford. Bill's father, who loved his granddaughter deeply, was also devastated. Bill's friends said, ""Get a lawyer!""So Bill and Andrea fought the case out in court, and ultimately Judge Martha Mills decided in his favor. Legally speaking, the mom couldn't make the case that Hawaii, where she had no support system, was a better place to raise Alyssa than Chicago, where the youngster had a large support network in place. But at a human level, the judge also felt uncomfortable with the ruling. She could see that its impact was devastating and that it would probably be contested. ""I knew an appeal would take a long time and rip the family apart,"" she said. So she called Bill to the stand and offered him another option. This is the wonder: Judge Mills saw beyond the current system. She was a passionate advocate of a process called restorative justice -- justice based on healing and transforming, not victory and punishment. There are no external decision-makers, just interested parties, who, unlike in court, have a chance to talk and be heard.She asked Bill if he'd be interested in exploring a way to work things out. His lawyer stood at the bench with him.""Lawyers -- they just complicate a whole lot of stuff,"" Bill said. ""If you'd seen the look on my lawyer's face. He spoke up: 'My client's not interested.' I said, 'I am interested.' My lawyer got pissed and walked into the hallway.""He was being offered a chance to work out the parenting complexities of this matter, which the ruling hadn't touched. Alyssa actually loved Hawaii and was prospering there. While he couldn't bear losing her, he knew that winning her back at the cost of tearing her away from her mother and friends would be disastrous. But he had his victory. ""I could have walked away,"" he said, ""and suffered the long-lasting effects."" He decided, instead, that he hadn't really won anything -- except perhaps the opportunity he had in this moment, precious beyond all reckoning, to save his family. At the time, Judge Mills was new in Parentage and Child Support Court. She's now the supervising judge, and she and other judges have referred more than 45 cases to circle keepers Elizabeth Vastine and Peter Newman since 2008. Bill Heenan's case was the first -- indeed, it may be the first child-custody case in the country to move beyond the legal process to... the healing process.""What makes the process magical is that it's voluntary,"" Peter said. Elizabeth and Peter are both lawyers, and have been part of Chicago's restorative justice community for years, among those who are quietly weaving a radically ancient, remarkably effective, social healing process into the city's legal and educational systems. As I've written about circles in the past: ""The idea was to build trust and develop an honest communication with one another as we sat together -- in all our wariness, egoism and self-doubt -- in a sort of vibrant equality.""One of the rituals of the circle is the talking piece -- any object one can hold in one's hands. Often the talking piece is a rock. Whoever holds it can talk without interruption, while the others listen -- such a rarity, especially in a child-custody case! ""This prevented it from turning into a bicker fest,"" Bill said.The circle was held shortly after Christmas. Elizabeth and Peter were the keepers. The participants were Bill, Andrea, Alyssa and the young girl's two grandfathers. It lasted about eight hours, far longer than most subsequent circles (the average length is two hours), but it ended with an agreement between Bill and Andrea. ""I got more accomplished in eight hours than a year in court,"" he said.Alyssa herself was the key player. At one point, according to Bill, she said, ""I love both of my parents. I can't make a decision. I don't know what to do."" ""Everyone ,"" he said, ""was crying.""Bill agreed that it was best for Alyssa to remain in Hawaii. Because he was paying child support, he couldn't afford multiple yearly airfares to bring her to Chicago, so he and Andrea devised a plan to share that cost without overburdening either of them. By the end of the day, an agreement was printed out and signed. ""Not legal language,"" said Elizabeth, ""but their language. Their spirit and their language and their content.""And four years later, Bill is still overflowing with gratitude for the circle that saved his relationship with his daughter and allowed her to prosper. She's an A-student in Hawaii; in Chicago, she'd been struggling. Dad's heart bursts with joy. It's not about custody. ""It's all about her,"" he said.In the early 20th century, Mary Parker-Follett, a visionary business-management consultant, wrote an essay called ""Constructive Conflict."" Since conflict is inevitable, maybe, she suggests, we should figure out how to use it intelligently. ""All polishing is done by friction,"" she wrote. ""The music of the violin we get by friction.""Elizabeth, reflecting on the case four years later, said of Bill: ""He knew in his heart this was the best thing. He called Judge Mills a genius and a saint. He told other firemen: 'Just get a rock and talk!'""Robert Koehler is an award-winning, Chicago-based journalist and nationally syndicated writer.
