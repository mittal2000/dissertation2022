Famously married in a lavish ceremony on August 20, 2011 and infamously separated just 72 days later -- the settlement battle dragged on for a grand total of 536 days. Kim is the one who originally initiated the proceedings in October 2011, citing irreconcilable differences. Now that it's finally over, both parties seem relieved to end the ordeal. Humphries even tweeted emphatically on April 18th, ""couldn't be happier!"" But that wasn't always the case.While it was widely publicized that Kim insisted on a divorce, Humphries dragged his feet, demanding an annulment. He failed to show up for several court proceedings, and thereby slowed things down. Humphries has always insisted that he was swindled by Kim  -- fooled into marriage as part of a publicity stunt masterminded by her family. Consequently, he also reportedly filed for spousal support from Kim to compensate for this betrayal.You would think that when a marriage clearly goes bad, both people would be eager to get out so they can put a stop to the bad feelings, and get a fresh start with the hope of turning whatever they had just been through into a life lesson. But that is easier said than done. In their case, Kris dug his heels in and demanded squatter's rights. For some people, when they feel cheated and betrayed, the concept of getting even overtakes the need to move on with their life, even at the expense of their own happiness. They want to pay the person back for hurting them. It is their way of making sure that person will be sorry for what they did. For some it is about money, but for most it is simply about getting even and righting where they were wronged.In my book How Could You Do This To Me? Learning To Trust After Betrayal there is a chapter called ""I'll Make You Pay."" While doing that might offer some sense of redemption, all it really does is keep that person locked in the past along with all its negativity. Seeking revenge serves only to keep the anger alive. You know what they say, that the best revenge is living well. If that's the case, you will get back at your ex far quicker by easing up and being happy in your new life than you will by showing how you just can't let them go. Doing that is not the same as forgiving, or of saying the other person didn't behave in an inexcusable way.The real pay-off here is to leave the pain behind, and gain insight into what happened so you can make sure it doesn't ever happen to you again.

3,QUEER VOICES,Expecting More: For All Those RuPaul's Drag Race Queens Who Just Rest on 'Pretty',"Meredith Zielke, Contributor

What Roxxxy doesn't realize is that by attacking the season's two funniest queens, she's attacking RuPaul.",2013-04-27,"LOS ANGELES, CA - APRIL 13: Roxxxy Andrews attends the 2013 NewNowNext Awards at The Fonda Theatre on April 13, 2013 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Michael Buckner/Getty Images for LOGO)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafb4fd2400005000968f68.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As an openly queer filmmaker and the executive editor of the documentary Web series 50Faggots, I pay attention to media editing and content. That's my jam. And though these filters make me more sensitive to the whole content-selection process, I sort of expect that most YouTube users today have dealt with similar keep-vs.-trash editing dilemmas before posting their material. I bring this up because watching reality TV shows and recognizing all the Frankensteined post-production is no longer a foreign process to the amateur viewer. Our feedback system is set on high alert, watching for moments and conversations unnaturally hodgepodged together (of which there are many). In other words, heavily edited broadcast video no longer manipulates us as much as it did before the emergence of consumer filmmaking. All this just goes to introduce the fact I love RuPaul's Drag Race, despite its heavily edited ways.You see, we expect that now of reality TV. When we're lying there in bed, eating yesterday's Thai food and watching RPDR on Logo, the criticality we bring to the viewing process is inherent to our role. And our role as active audience members is a far leap from the early days of film, when the projected image of a train rolling toward the viewer on the big screen would send moviegoers fleeing their seats in fear of being hit. The intention of those early films was to create a shocked and passive audience, whereas now, reality TV puts us right in the position they want us: knowing enough that we're familiar with the inner workings of content manipulation, but still in awe of the pedestrian-made-star glow of fame. The position and reality we're deliberately placed in is just twisted enough to keep us hooked. I mean, come on, we love being voyeurs to all the shit that goes down on these shows, and we can't wait to meet these now-celebrities in person, making our obsession central to the success of reality TV (despite the fact we know better).This brings me to my point: knowing better. The last few episodes of Season 5 of RPDR were the first ever to leave me fuming. Personally, I can't stand when someone fails to admit their jealousy, bullies the very person they're jealous of and instigates a ganging-up on that person. And I don't even think Roxxxy Andrews can pinpoint the bitter emotions that lie underneath her excuses for acting all third-grade. Actually, ""third-grade"" might be too generous. Maybe ""delusional,"" ""manipulative"" and ""drama-causing"" is more the T. (Of course, there were queens who acted just as bad, or even worse, in past seasons, and that's equally ugly.) She seems to believe that drag should favor runway bathing suits, hairography and flat-lined humor, and that somehow this is creative.Think about what kind of voice of reason, wisdom and utter hilarity Sharon Needles has become for so many people. Can you picture Roxxxy handling the role of ""America's Next Drag Superstar"" and LGBT spokesperson as comprehensively? Sharon won her fans' affection with a mix of brain, creativity and crass smut. She pairs frankness with the ability to digest criticism: Remember when she apologized to Max Mutchnick for talking back during their ""Hot in Tuckahoe"" challenge? Conscientiously, Sharon realized that that mistake was hers to claim. She also owned her part in the Sharon Needles/Phi Phi O'Hara shenanigans. And the fact that she's as self-deprecating as she is motivating encourages others in her wake to take their ego (not their way of life) less seriously. (At least this is how she interacted onset and, for the most part, since, although we can't ignore her flippant and captured insults, which were notably problematic, not to mention disappointing. This is inexcusable.)RPDR is my favorite show (for many real-life reasons), but I've got to say that this season leaves me with a bad taste. If you re-watch episodes from past seasons sporadically throughout, you really notice how much more honest, empathic, open-minded and playful past queens were with themselves and each other, in very real ways, and in situations when it was hard to be that way. With each consecutive season, though, each new crop of queens seems to grow more aware of (and possibly motivated by) their own compounded fame, and it causes them to focus on the cold, hard competition instead of supporting each other as a community. Unfortunately, there's a lot of effort put into discrediting each other's form of drag. Much of this season's judgement comes from within, and less from the actual judging panel, meaning throwing queens under the bus happens more often in the Interior Illusions Lounge than onstage. (Just think of the cannonfire that would have been spared had the feuding queens not shredded their community from the inside out.)What's lacking on the show is a transparent critique of the show itself. RPDR selects queens from different backgrounds and drag genres but never prompts an explicit conversation about the clashing of their respective ideals. Most fights between queens involve telling each other who deserves the crown more, and why. And as it turned out recently, Roxxxy claimed, to both Jinkx Monsoon and Alaska Thunderfuck, that being a funny queen means you're mocking and disrespecting the art of drag. Aside from being unfounded, this argument is one to be made with the show, not fellow contestants. What Roxxxy doesn't realize is that by attacking the season's two funniest queens, she's attacking RuPaul. There have been times on earlier seasons when RuPaul has asserted a correlation between savvy drag and improvisational humor, therefore instilling these values in the very foundation of RPDR. For this reason, acting challenges shouldn't come as a surprise to newer contestants, and, consequently, they should know that RuPaul likes herself a funny queen. Humor is crucial not only for connecting with a wide fan base but for emulating the Queen herself. (After all, isn't it RuPaul's purpose to select the top-shelf stars who can achieve her level of integrity, peerlessness and repartee?) We all know that humor, when done well, is an intelligent form of social critique, and I'd say that it's among the most useful tools for LGBTQ public figures. It's a hive mind out there. When bitter seeds are planted, they beget nasty environments. I'm not even talking about who's throwing shade. RuPaul made the distinction, with Sonique on Season 2, between sass and unwarranted bitchiness; this is what I'm referencing. And in every season, you can always spot the queen who doesn't grasp that distinction, based on how she performs in the ""Bitch-Fest"" or ""Library Is Open"" mini-challenges: Her act is so heavy with pent-up bitterness that it's not funny at all. Everyone needs doses of being read to keep egos in check, but reading is a talent, and good reading requires good taste, intelligence and wit. Otherwise, it's an uninformed opinion and can be dismissed as just that. So my burning question is this: Why, when so many queens are drawn to performing in drag because they inherently march to a different beat, is there so much intra-community discrimination? As we see over and over on RPDR, people's reasons for being there and wanting to be there are diverse, sensitive and emotionally charged. This is not just a competition. We're in a time where LGBTQ communities are in need of openness and vulnerability (especially given that the bonding agents that were once the gay rights/liberation movements and the AIDS crisis have been replaced by the divisive agent of marriage). And RPDR is the perfect opportunity to witness this potential on a small scale. If this is sounding hippy-dippy, let me just say that past queens have already exhibited generous traits that function to bond and not isolate. I miss Jujubee for her talent, heart and sauce. Now she was good with approaching difficult, potentially havoc-wreaking conversations on the show. And Nina Flowers, Latrice Royale, Sharon Needles, Alaska Thunderfuck, Chad Michaels, Carmen Carrera, Yara Sofia, Milan, Alexis Mateo, Ongina, Pandora Boxx, Shangela and Raven... all these queens were too, in their own ways. Beneath some of the cattiness that undeniably comes along with competition, most girls displayed a refreshing dose of self-possession and self-admitting honesty that, especially this season, morphed into entitlement, defensiveness and parry. And it goes unchecked, as does the bullying. I understand why the forming of cliques (""Rolaskatox"" and ""The Heathers"" alike) feels necessary to bullies: They provide power and intimidation in numbers, a hall pass to tear other queens apart out of mere jealousy, free rein to act annoying, white noise to distract from a lack of individual character, and protection for those moments when someone debunks your bullying as insecurity. But we're all insecure. Just be human about it. I know this is a competition, but is it so hard to be a good human at the same time?If I sound tired, yeah, I do sometimes tire of people not checking themselves at the door, of people pretending, or believing, that they're the only person in the world. That's a cringe-worthy stereotype of our generation. I'm not judging Roxxxy or other past-season bullies; I'm judging their judgment, and the delusion that they project onto others. I hope it's obvious that I still adore RPDR; part of the reason I love it so much is that it makes me feel and apply all this nuance. What I'd really like is to see another queen win who, like Sharon Needles, encourages uniqueness à la RuPaul herself circa 1980s Atlanta/New York, as opposed to sameness à la big-hair pageant girls. How long are we going to blindingly award the very similar concepts that keep pride parades mired in corporate-sponsored homogeneity? If we're abiding by RuPaul's charisma/uniqueness/nerve/talent definition of what ideal drag representation looks like, then Jinkx Monsoon is the queen most deserving of the title of ""America's Next Drag Superstar"" this season. Unlike Roxxxy's analysis of her, Jinkx is chock-full of schticks. In fact, she's supersaturated with talent, and by no means did she skate through the competition. Her strength and lack of being ""victimized"" (a misinterpretation of the situation anyway) just exposes Roxxxy's sick satisfaction in hurting others. Jinkx happens to be a good person, attempting, through roadblocks, to create community and not destroy it. She would would absolutely benefit from a makeup overhaul, but haven't we heard every RPDR alumna say she learned major painting tips from being on the show?My memory is drawn to Feast of Fun podcast #1644 with Sharon Needles and Alaska Thunderfuck. This is one of a number of times I am reminded that Sharon Needles, like Jinkx Monsoon, takes her fame and doesn't soak it in like a tampon but gives back in such subtly sensitive ways that it'll shock you sideways. Who would have thought that our supposedly ""spooky"" Sharon Needles would provide the very combo-personality necessary to better this ""me"" generation and, in turn, every LGBTQ human out there?I don't glorify Sharon Needles; she's no angel. In fact she's quite the opposite, and she would be happy to know so. I don't vilify Roxxxy either, although I was happy to see Mathu Andersen clock her dimness, and Gloria Allred clock her spite and ""pageant babble."" At the end of the day, that might make me an idle bully for wishing repercussion on Roxxxy. Maybe we're all a part of the problem. So it's just a competition. And we're just a passive audience. I'd say both are as far from the truth as possible. The competing queens are people just like any who look for community acceptance. And we're no longer an uninformed audience. Yes, the show is a Frankenstein patchwork of misaligned response clips, but what's obvious is what's not edited -- the clips that play out unadulterated -- and from those rise the evident bullies. We should be attuned by now in our experience with ingesting media to differentiate between what's a machine-sewn edit and what's hand-stitched. We should know better."

In 2010, he joined Google and is now the director of Google Ideas, a think tank dedicated to confronting global problems with technology.Cohen was recently named to Time magazine's annual list of ""100 Most Influential People In The World,"" just in time for the release of his new book, which he co-authored with Eric Schmidt, Google's executive chairman. The New Digital Age: Reshaping the Future of People, Nations and Business, which hits shelves on Tuesday, discusses how billions of people connecting to the Internet will affect global politics, society and the economy.The Huffington Post spoke with Cohen at Google Ideas' headquarters in New York, where he discussed online privacy, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange, and the future of the Internet.The New Digital Age starts out pretty optimistic about this new wave of digital technology, but later in the book, things get pretty dark, especially in your chapter on terrorism.What we tried to do in the book is not engage in the debate about whether technology is good or bad, because it's not a relevant debate when technology is coming and coming fast. You can sit and debate if it's good or bad, but it doesn't change the fact that 5 billion people are connecting to the Internet. What we tried to do was capture what that's going to look like in the next decade, for good and for ill.Where do you and Eric Schmidt stand on the future of online privacy?We actually state pretty boldly that in the future there will be this absence of a delete button that's going to present a challenge to citizens around the world.Even for kids?We've talked to parents in New York, Saudi Arabia, Africa, and it becomes very clear that their children are using technology at a pace that's faster than their physical maturity process, so kids are using technology earlier and faster. Our conclusion in the book is that parents need to talk to their kids and start early about the importance of online privacy and security, years before they even talk about the birds and the bees.I remember in health class in elementary school where, you know, they scare you away from using drugs, they scare you away from having unsafe sexual activity, they scare you away from using alcohol and tobacco. This is part of that conversation.What's Google's role in the future of online privacy?I mean there's obviously shared responsibility over privacy and communication in a company. I think companies need to put up tools that put privacy and security in the hands of their users and make it easy to understand those tools. In Google’s case, two step verification is a perfect example of this. Part of the responsibility of the technology industry is to anticipate the challenges of the vast majority of its future users and proactively start thinking about them now, and proactively build products that address those challenges.Speaking of privacy, in your book, you didn't hide your disapproval of Julian Assange.Our fundamental critique of Assange is that -- who is he to play the role of God in determining what should be known publicly and what should not be known publicly? There are laws in place that provide a process with which people can get documents from classified to unclassified. And who is he to decide that process doesn't work and that he's going to indiscriminately leak information that could get people killed?According to the introduction of the book, the Internet is the world’s ""largest experiment in anarchy."" But you come across as incredibly optimistic about that. Hooray for anarchy?Here's my view: cyberspace is the world's largest ungoverned space. I fundamentally believe there's no country in the world that's worse with the arrival of the Internet. There's some countries that've gone downhill, but it's not because of the Internet. You connect 5 billion people in the next decade to cyberspace, that becomes even more true. What becomes complicated is how [autocratic] regimes deal with this. The 57 percent of the world's population that's living under autocracy will go from offline to online. That's going to be very confusing for the regimes because they're going to find that a population of 20 million people in the physical world really looks like a population of 500 million people online. What dictators will try to do is replicate the laws of the physical world in cyberspace, and they're going to find that very difficult to do.But can't autocracies keep the Internet out?Less than 1 percent of the population of Myanmar has access to the Internet, but everyone you talk to has heard of the Internet and has some idea of the concept and the value system. Why? Because of advertising. There's one country in the world that has an absence of advertising, and that's North Korea. There's one ad in the entire country, and it's a billboard inside of the airport for cars. Everything else is creepy pictures of the dictator and landscapes. So what that means is the vast majority of the world's population, the 5 billion people we talk about in the book, they will come to know the Internet as an idea and as a concept years before they come to experience it as a user. What that means is in the spirit of autocrats trying to control the Internet, one could argue that the Internet is the best exporter of democratic values in the entire world, and it's already permeated societies.So does technology enable revolution?I'll say that technology will make revolutions start happening faster, but it'll make them harder to finish. Technology can't create leaders and cause institutions to appear.Alright. But what do kids in Iran know about their phones that kids in America don't?[When I was in Iran] I saw all these young people using devices that I used, but in different ways. What I realized is they were actually reading the instruction manuals. A phone means something different to them than what it means to me. They have their civil liberties restricted, and every functionality of that device matters.They used Bluetooth in Iran to call and text complete strangers in busy bazaars, just to have a good time. We think of Bluetooth as that device that lets you talk and drive at the same time, but Iranians used it to basically call and text complete strangers that were standing 30 feet from them, and they didn't even know where the call was coming from. You wouldn't do that in the U.S. because it'd be bizarre and out of the norm. But when inter-gender interaction is frowned upon, that's what people do, they innovate. Fast-forward to 2009, when the government shut down the phones and Internet, you had clusters of people with Bluetooth-capable devices. Not surprisingly, they started sharing content with people who were within range.I imagine these would-be revolutionaries are surveilled by their governments. How are they going to find privacy in this world without a delete button?One of the things you can sort of imagine [in the future] is people selling black market identities. Either to criminals or witnesses or whistleblowers -- you literally create a whole fake identity for someone that they can use in all their interactions. Pictures, everything. The challenge is it works as long as you don't get photographed. What problems can digital technology not fix?It's not a panacea, there are problems in the world that technology can't fix. You can't fix water shortages, you can't storm a Ministry of the Interior with a cell phone, you can't magically create leaders and institutions overnight, you can't eat it, you can't shield a bullet. But the power of information, which is itself produced by these devices, ultimately gives people options and choices.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

Our nation has become all too aware of limb loss this April as a result of the Boston bombings. On the day of the blasts, I, like many others, was compelled to read and view everything about the attack. Horrific pictures and stories flooded the media. Photo galleries warned of graphic imagery. I looked anyway. Although I was alerted, I found the pictures disturbing. In particular, photos of Jeff Bauman, a young man whose lower limbs had been blown off, were striking and upsetting.I was moved by these pictures because I know that there is a long road of recovery in the future for Mr. Bauman and others who lost their limbs that day. It will not be easy for them, but I pray that they will persevere and will return home to their lives soon. I am knowledgeable about what the rehabilitation process will be like for them. I volunteer at a hospital that has an amputee clinic, and I witness, on a weekly basis, the struggles and challenges of those trying to recover from the limb loss.I am not an amputee myself, but I share a connection with the amputee community because of my dogs, both of whom are missing limbs. One of them, Festus, lost his front right leg when he was a stray puppy. He got trapped under some debris when he was out on the streets alone, injuring his leg. Once found and brought to a shelter, his damaged leg was evaluated and eventually amputated. My other dog, Cyrus, was born without front legs, and he walks with the aid of a wheeled cart. Both of my dogs are trained and certified therapy dogs, and we visit several hospitals each week. When amputees meet Festus and Cyrus, they often say, ""They are just like me,"" and, ""I will work harder on my exercises now that I have met them!"" I am proud that my dogs serve as inspiration to people who are learning to walk again.When I am out in public with the dogs, people stare. ""Poor things!"" they whisper to each other. Those who are bolder may bluntly state, ""What's wrong with those dogs?"" I tell them that there is nothing wrong with them. They are differently abled. I prefer to use this phrase rather than ""disabled."" My dogs are able; they just move differently from typical four-legged dogs. There is no need to feel sorry for them. They lead happy and productive lives.I empathize with the victims of the bombings because I know that, in addition to having to overcome physical obstacles in the near future, they will have to endure a lifetime of attention and questions. People will want to know what happened to them, and they will be asked to relive those horrible moments again and again. I hope that they find the strength to not only become physically strong but find a well of emotional strength as well.My experience with the amputee community goes back to my childhood. My best friend's older brother had cancer, and his leg was amputated when he was a teenager. When he came home from the hospital after his surgery, I was frightened to see him. I was young and worried that he would not be the same person. Would I stare or say the wrong thing? However, once I saw him and started hanging out at their house like I always did, I very quickly discovered that he was, in fact, the same. While he was recovering, I was thrilled that he would sit and play games with us. We would all laugh and have a great time together. He was the cool older brother, and I looked up to him. Although he ultimately lost his battle with cancer, I will always remember him and be grateful for how he positively affected my life.In the past few years, I've had a new personal hero: a young man named Spencer West. Mr. West is a double amputee whose humanitarian work is truly impressive. In his memoir, Standing Tall: My Journey, he recounts how, as a child, he fought to be normal. He was physically different from his peers, but he did not want to be treated differently. As he grew older, he became aware that his difference is what made him special. People noticed him for his difference, and people were inspired by his story, and he decided to take advantage of that difference. As someone who draws attention, he used his status to bring awareness to other issues. In 2008 he went to Kenya to build a school. More charitable work followed, and in 2011 he summited Mount Kilimanjaro on his hands and raised over $500,000 to bring sustainable clean water projects to communities in Africa. Next month he will walk in We Walk 4 Water, another charity event. He is an active member of Free the Children and is often pictured wearing a T-shirt that states, ""Redefine Possible."" He is a shining example of being true to oneself while making an impact in the world.Mr. West is not ""normal"" (whatever that means). He is extraordinary. As he matured, he learned to embrace his difference, and, in turn, he brought attention to others in need. I am hopeful that the victims of the Boston bombings will learn of the contributions of individuals like Mr. West, people who allow being differently abled to inform their choices and their potential in life in positive ways.I hope that you will join me in celebrating Limb Loss Awareness this month.

7,DIVORCE,Why You Should Be Nice To The Step Parent,"Marina Sbrochi, Contributor
Author Nasty Divorce: A Kid's Eye View and Stop Looking for a ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/why-you-should-be-nice-to_us_5b9d10f6e4b03a1dcc843c25,Here is what my ex's wife does for my children: she loves them.,2013-04-26,"Caucasian female teacher and mom with baby girl talking in kindergarten. Horizontal shape, focus on background",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d10f6240000310094edfc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Admittedly, I'm very lucky. The woman my ex-husband married is super nice. So, that makes it a lot easier to be nice to her. That being said, I know not everyone is as lucky. Some will have unreasonable exes with even wackier new spouses. But let's cut the drama and insecurity and be honest: most people's exes will marry a relatively nice person. Of course there are outliers with the super insane and unreasonable, but I can't imagine that the vast majority are truly working with a stepparent that is beyond reason.Here is what my ex's wife does for my children: she loves them. She thinks of them and their wishes when planning events for them. She remembers sunscreen. She keeps me in the loop with what's going on. She offers to help out with carpools, birthdays and anything else. She does it all politely and with class. Guess what? My kids love her too! How does that make me feel? I could feel sad that she gets to be with them when I'm not around. I could be sad that they love her. I could even be jealous that she is a much better party planner and far more organized than I could ever wish to be. But I'm not sad at all -- I'm actually super happy. Do you know why? I want my children to be happy and feel loved. Let me ease your biggest fear first: your children will not love the stepparent more than they love you. Do you hear me? Your children love YOU! Believe it. Do you know there are children that withstand years of abuse and still love their parents? Of course, you are not that parent. I'm sure you do your best and love your children with all your heart. They have no reason not to love you! Trust me and let that fear go. It's okay to be sad or jealous of the relationship your ex and the new spouse have with your children. Perhaps you are less than thrilled that you have to split time with your children and your ex's new family. Maybe your divorce ended with cheating, which most likely means you do not like the stepparent to begin with. These are pretty normal feelings. You can't change the cards you've been dealt. It's how you handle these feelings that makes all the difference.Here are some great reasons to be cool to the stepparent:1. You love your children. This is the number one-reason to be nice to the stepparent. Think of it like this: when the kids are with your ex and the stepparent, that stepparent sees you in the children. Don't you want only good thoughts about you running through the stepparent's head? 2. The alternative is far worse. Do you want your children to hate going over to the other parent's house? Do you want your children to have a mean and nasty stepparent? Do you want your littles ones to be neglected? NO! Of course you don't. So rejoice in the fact that they are being loved by more people.3. Anger shortens your life. Stress can wreak all sorts of havoc on your body. So if you have nothing better to do but aggravate the stepparent and micro-manage your children when they are in your ex's care, you are setting yourself up for a shorter life. If you die of a heart attack caused by your own anger and stress, guess who gets to be with your kids forever? That's right -- not you. So be cool. You have one life and if your children honestly mean the world to you, take care to be kind to those that are in their lives. Sometimes, all it takes is one person taking the high road to iron out a sticky situation involving four adults and children from the past relationships. The children are the innocent casualties in a divorce. Divorce happens for all sorts of reasons, and it's never fun for anyone. However, you can change how you react to it. Be the bigger person. Your children will thank you for it -- and so will the step parent."

9,DIVORCE,Should I Tell My Future Child About My First Marriage?,"Amira Young, Contributor
Writer, La Divorcee Vita",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/should-i-tell-my-future-c_us_5b9d1232e4b03a1dcc84479c,"I left my ex for someone else. I wasn't cheating on him. Rather, it was for a person who didn't exist yet: my unborn child.",2013-04-26,Style redhead girl with suitcase at beautiful autumn alley.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d123224000050005370f0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I left my ex for someone else. I wasn't cheating on him. Rather, it was for a person who didn't exist yet: my unborn child.One Sunday night in December, I asked for my ex to wait for me to write a check for a bill. He threw a fit. He started screaming at a high pitch like a banshee and went flying out of the room. He starting banging on the linen cabinet, hitting the pillows on the couch and running his hands loudly across the blinds. I sighed through the screams. Another tantrum. This behavior wasn't anything new, and it wasn't the worst I had seen. Better him throwing a fit than telling me I was like a child again. I was inclined to tune it out as I always did.Something stopped me, though. I had gone to a baby shower that day, which was not easy for me; I'm not sure if I'll be able to have children due to a medical condition. In that moment, an inside voice of reason told me to stop and look around.I knew I wanted a family, perhaps even to adopt a child. During my ex's fit of anger, I realized that if he and I had a child together, it would be terrifying. How would I explain his tantrums and comfort her (or him)? What if he got out of control and hurt our child? Could I even stop him from hurting me? And I realized at that moment I would do anything to protect my unborn child -- even leave my husband.Now I am single again, and after much soul searching, I am once again looking for a partner to marry and start a family with. Which leads me to another question: should I tell my future child about my first marriage?I'm sure he or she will find out eventually that I was previously married. As long as I have relatives who were at my first wedding, my child will know there was a man in my life prior to her father. But whether or not I'll tell her the details is something I debate a lot. After all, she doesn't really have to know.It could have been just like my uncle's first marriage -- that wife was disregarded as a memory. No one mentions what happened or how it ended, just that it did. His marriage to his second wife, my cousin's mother and my aunt, ended too. But unlike the first, there was no way to hide it.I know that one day, my child will come home from school and ask my future husband and me why Jimmy's or Susie's parents live in different houses and why they have two sets of everything. To explain divorce to a child is a difficult task, and particularly more challenging as a divorcee. I had always hoped that I would find a man who also went through divorce, so that I could have someone stand by my side and help me explain it. After all, how do you tell a child that happily ever after doesn't always happen? How can you explain something as complicated as the end of a marriage? And how do you tell them that sometimes, like in my case, divorce is not only okay but sometimes necessary? I would normally not be inclined to tell her anything about my previous life; after all, it's in the past, and my ex is never coming back. However, I think of the nights that I was afraid to sleep next to him due to his mental instability. I think of his temper, his verbal, emotional and financial abuse, not to mention the night he tackled me on the bed and shouted expletives at me. No matter how much I want those memories to go away, they are a part of my history. My thoughts then drift to my child's future. One day, she is going to date, and I pray she will find a good partner. But there is a chance that person will be like my ex -- pressuring her to do things she didn't really want to do, telling her that her opinion isn't worthwhile and trying to change her. I want my child to be who she was always meant to be. I don't want anyone to take away her light through abuse. Therefore, she has to know it happened to me. She has to know about my first marriage.I don't have to tell her everything when she is young, but as she grows, I refuse to hide the truth from her. I hope she understands one day that the night my ex's tantrum shook me out of the slumber of abuse, I realized that I loved her even before she walked this earth. And love is always worth it."

You're finally divorced. Finally done with your former spouse, who didn't know how to discipline your children, didn't know how to make the right decision, and didn't know anything about anything. You are done. Good riddance.But wait! There's more. Welcome to the unknown, brave new world of co-parenting, or perhaps its more complicated sibling, co-parenting with stepparents! Splendid. Little disagreements that turned into giant disputes when you were married are now exponentially worse as a divorced couple (an oxymoron, don't you think?).Even under the best of circumstances, co-parenting brings with it many obstacles and challenges for both parents and children of divorce. Differing parenting styles, which were often the source of many marital tiffs, continue well into the post-divorce years. So even when all parents are chanting the ""in the best interests of the child"" mantra, eruptions can still cause unspeakable damage to the family unit. So, what are parents to do? Race back to the courtroom? Call their respective attorneys to send a nasty letter to the offending parent? Obstacles and ChallengesWhat exactly are these anticipated obstacles and challenges? They range from disagreements relating to after school activities to arguments over what camp the child will attend over the summer. Elinor Robin, Ph.D has put together a list of tips she calls, ""50 Guidelines For Divorcing and Divorced Parents."" These guidelines can help you make the transition of divorce and rebuild your family. It is possible to minimize the stress and damage of divorce. These tips will help you help your children and establish clear baselines for appropriate co-parenting. Tip #1, which sets the stage for the remaining 49 tips, is to declare a ceasefire with your former spouse. By calling a truce post-divorce, you are opening the door for a successful co-parenting environment. Practical AdviceIt is inevitable that you and your ex will butt heads and find things to argue over after your divorce. This is, after all, what you do. And, old patterns are hard to break. So as you move forward, think about the impact your actions will have on your children, and act accordingly. Divorce coaches and mediators work with individuals and couples during the divorce process to facilitate emotional growth and dispute resolution. Take advantage of what these professionals can offer you, as their information and insight can help you avoid making the same relationship mistakes next time."
