A UN official on May 15 urged the Philippines to do more to reduce the large numbers of its women who die from complications from pregnancy and childbirth. United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) data shows a Filipina mother has a one in 140 chance of dying while delivering a child, which translates to around 11 mothers dying everyday or 4,500 every year. AFP PHOTO / JAIME RIUS (Photo credit should read JAIME RIUS/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1c6543c000020010beb26.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LONDON (AP) — In the past decade, billions of dollars have been spent trying to save the lives of mothers in developing countries using strategies — usually inexpensive drugs — deemed essential by the U.N. health agency.Yet two large analyses of maternal health programs— including one conducted by the U.N. itself — report that the efforts appeared almost useless, raising troubling questions about why all that money was spent.While critics are calling for the pricey global initiatives to be significantly overhauled, the programs are still being implemented despite little proof they work. The practices mainly involve things like ensuring women giving birth get cheap drugs such as magnesium sulphate to treat labor complications or pre-emptive antibiotics for those getting a cesarean section.Even public health officials acknowledge they were taken aback by the studies.""Nobody could have been more surprised than I was when we got the results,"" said Dr. Omrana Pasha of Aga Khan University in Pakistan, who led a study of maternal health interventions in six countries in Latin America, Africa and Asia.""In clinical medicine, we would not prescribe a drug unless multiple trials show that it works,"" she added. ""The FDA won't allow a drug to be marketed without that evidence. But things are different in public health.""At an international meeting of U.N. partners starting Monday in South Africa, health officials are getting ready to ask donors for even more money to pour into maternal health programs. Since 2009, the U.S. has invested more than $13 billion in maternal and child survival, hoping to save lives by supporting ""high-impact"" health interventions.According to the research papers, including one done in 30 countries that tracked more than 300,000 women, scientists found no link between the supposedly life-saving interventions and the death rates of women giving birth. Areas that used the interventions didn't have better survival rates for mothers than areas that didn't.The two papers published last year are the biggest to assess the effectiveness of maternal health strategies, although smaller studies have previously suggested the methods help. But they gained little traction, perhaps because there doesn't appear to be an easy fix.Experts, meanwhile, are largely stumped as to why their methods failed to prevent deaths.""We assume that if women get these things, they will be saved. But it's too simple to say one plus one equals two,"" said Dr. Marleen Temmerman, director of WHO's maternal health department.She isn't convinced the interventions don't work. She suspects there were problems implementing the strategies.""Maybe the health facility has the medicine, but the man who has the key to the cupboard is gone,"" she suggested.Temmerman also said it would be dangerous if donors abruptly slashed their support for maternal health initiatives.""The message is not to stop investing, it's to invest money more wisely,"" she said.Some experts said existing plans should be adjusted.""These essential interventions are important but they are not enough,"" said Sandrine Simon, a public health adviser at Doctors of the World charity. ""This is about more than buying the right medicines.""But others said major changes were required to save more women.""We need to be more honest and serious about past failures otherwise we will keep making the same mistakes,"" said Bill Easterly, an economist at New York University. ""It's not just the fault of countries receiving aid who aren't implementing the technology properly, it's the fault of Western aid agencies and donors who are not trying hard enough to get it right."""
1,POLITICS,Will Supremes Apply Cell Phone Privacy to Metadata Collection?,"Marjorie Cohn, ContributorProfessor Emerita, Thomas Jefferson School of Law",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/will-supremes-apply-cell-_b_5543952.html,This decision may well presage how the Court will rule on the constitutionality of the NSA metadata collection program when that issue inevitably comes before it.,2014-06-30,"FILE - This June 6, 2013, file photo, shows the National Security Agency's Utah Data Center in Bluffdale, Utah. The massive National Security Agency data center about 25 miles south of Salt Lake City is using far less water than expected, utility records obtained by The Salt Lake Tribune show. Records from the city of Bluffdale, which sells water to the facility, show monthly water use at the $1.7 billion data center peaked last July at 6.2 million gallons. That's well below what the 1 million gallons a day that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers predicted the center would need to cool its computer processors. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ce6d1f00003d02257235.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In one of the most significant Fourth Amendment rulings ever handed down by the Supreme Court, all nine justices agreed in an opinion involving two companion cases, Riley v. California and United States v. Wurie, that police generally need a warrant before reading data on the cell phone of an arrestee. This decision may well presage how the Court will rule on the constitutionality of the National Security Agency (NSA) metadata collection program when that issue inevitably comes before it.Warrants Needed to Search Cell Phone DataThere has always been a preference for search warrants when the police conduct a Fourth Amendment search or seizure. But, over the years, the Court has carved out certain exceptions to the warrant requirement, including the search incident to a lawful arrest. The 1969 case of Chimel v. California defined the parameters of this exception. Upon a lawful arrest, police can search the person of the arrestee and areas within his immediate control from which he could secure a weapon or destroy evidence. Four years later, in United States v. Robinson, the Court confirmed that the search incident to a lawful arrest is a bright-line rule. These types of searches will not be analyzed on a case-by-case basis. If the arrest is lawful, a search incident to it needs no further justification. It does not matter whether the officer is concerned in a given case that the arrestee might be armed or destroy evidence. In Riley/Wurie, the Court declined to apply the search incident to a lawful arrest exception to searches of data contained on an arrestee's cell phone. Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the Court that the dual rationales for applying the exception to the search of physical objects - protecting officers and preventing destruction of evidence -- do not apply to the digital content on cell phones: ""There are no comparable risks when the search is of digital data.""Moreover, ""[m]odern cell phones, as a category,"" Roberts noted, ""implicate privacy concerns far beyond those implicated by the search of a cigarette pack, a wallet, or a purse."" Responding to the government's assertion that a search of cell phone data is ""materially indistinguishable"" from searches of physical items, Roberts quipped, ""That is like saying a ride on horseback is materially indistinguishable from a flight to the moon."" Indeed, Roberts observed, the search of a cell phone would typically provide the government with even more personal information than the search of a home, an area that has traditionally been given the strongest privacy protection. Modern cell phones, Roberts wrote, ""are now such a pervasive and insistent part of daily life that the proverbial visitor from Mars might conclude they were an important feature of human anatomy."" Roberts was referring to the ubiquitous presence of cell phones appended to our ears as we walk down the street. But the Court held that while a warrant is usually required to search data on an arrestee's cell phone, officers could rely on the exigent circumstances exception in appropriate cases. For example, when a suspect is texting an accomplice who is preparing to detonate a bomb, or a child abductor may have information about the child's location on his cell phone, or circumstances suggest the phone will be the target of an imminent attempt to erase the data on it, police may dispense with a search warrant.   Metadata Collection Implicates Similar Privacy ConcernsThe Riley/Wurie opinion provides insights into how the Court will decide other digital-era privacy issues. Roberts was concerned that ""[a]n Internet search and browsing history, for example, can be found on an Internet-enabled phone and could reveal an individual's private interests or concerns -- perhaps a search for certain symptoms of disease, coupled with frequent visits to WebMD."" The Chief Justice could have been describing the NSA metadata collection program, which requires telecommunications companies to produce all of our telephone communications every day. Although the government claims it does not read the content of those communications, it does monitor the identities of the sender and recipient, and the date, time, duration, place, and unique identifiers of the communication. As Roberts pointed out in the cell phone case, much can be learned from this data. Calls to a clinic that performs abortions or visits to a gay website can reveal intimate details about a person's private life. A URL -- such as www.webMD.com/depression -- can contain significant information, even without examining the content. Whether we access the Internet with our cell phones, or with our computers, the same privacy considerations are implicated.Roberts quoted Justice Sonia Sotomayor's concurrence in United States v. Jones, the case in which the Court held that a warrant is generally required before police install and monitor a GPS tracking device on a car. Sotomayor wrote, ""GPS monitoring generates a precise, comprehensive record of a person's public movements that reflects a wealth of detail about her familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations."" U.S. District Court Judge Richard J. Leon also cited that concurrence by Sotomayor in his 2013 decision that the metadata collection probably violates the Fourth Amendment (Klayman v. Obama).And both Roberts and Leon distinguished the cell phone search and metadata collection, respectively, from the 1979 case of Smith v. Maryland, in which the Court held that no warrant is required for a telephone company to use a pen register to identify numbers dialed by a particular caller. The Smith Court concluded that a pen register was not a Fourth Amendment ""search,"" and therefore the police did not need to use a warrant or an exception to the warrant requirement. In order to constitute a ""search,"" a person must have a reasonable expectation of privacy that is violated. The Court said in Smith that a person does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in numbers dialed from a phone since he voluntarily transmits them to a third party -- the phone company. Roberts stated in the Riley/Wurie decision: ""There is no dispute here that the officers engaged in a search of Wurie's cell phone."" Likewise, Leon wrote that the issue of ""whether a pen register constitutes a 'search' is a far cry from the issue in the [metadata collection] case."" Leon added, ""When do present-day circumstances -- the evolution of the Government's surveillance capabilities, citizens' phone habits, and the relationship between the NSA and the telecom companies -- become so thoroughly unlike those considered by the Supreme Court 34 years ago that a precedent like Smith simply does not apply? The answer, unfortunately for the Government, is now."" If the Court is consistent in its analysis, it will determine that the collection by the government of all of our electronic records implicates the same privacy concerns as the inspection of the data on our cell phones. It remains to be seen if and when the metadata collection issue comes before the Court. But the fact that the cell phone decision was 9-0 is a strong indication that all of the justices, regardless of ideology, are deeply concerned about protecting the privacy of our electronic communications.Marjorie Cohn is a professor at Thomas Jefferson School of law, deputy secretary general of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers, and a former president of the National Lawyers Guild.

Those numbers don't reflect the general population of the United States. Meanwhile, 10 percent of NPR's newsroom is black, 7 percent is Asian and 5 percent is Latino. He said he doesn't believe the end of ""Tell Me More"" will affect the numbers and that the statistics don't tell the whole story, but added that the concerns of minority groups ""may get lost in the majority white culture.

Knife-wielding assailants left at least 29 people dead and more than 130 wounded in an unprecedented attack at a Chinese train station, with state media blaming separatists from Xinjiang. Victims described attackers dressed in black bursting into Kunming station in the southwestern province of Yunnan and slashing indiscriminately as people queued to buy tickets, prompting shock and outrage.

Police shot four of the attackers dead.China's leaders have vowed to strike hard at religious extremists and separatist groups, which they blame for a series of violent attacks in Xinjiang, the traditional home of the Muslim Uighur ethnic minority.""The Kunming Municipal People's Procuratorate found that the suspects were involved in organizing, leading or taking part in the terrorist attack as well as intentional homicide,"" the official Xinhua news agency said, citing the prosecutor.""The crimes of the four defendants are clear and the evidence is abundant,"" the prosecutor said.The Kunming attack was one of the single deadliest incidents attributed by the government to militants. A suicide bombing in May killed 39 people at a market in Xinjiang's capital, Urumqi.Authorities had laid out the charges in March, but have now formally filed them, paving the way for an imminent trial. The four surviving defendants, all of whom have Uighur names, are likely to be given the death penalty.Courts in China are controlled by the ruling Communist Party, making it unusual for those accused of crimes - particularly in politicized cases - to have a fair trial.Xinjiang, resource-rich and strategically located on the borders of central Asia, is crucial to China's growing energy needs. Analysts say that much of the proceeds have gone to the majority Han Chinese, stoking resentment among Uighurs.Exiled Uighur groups and human rights activists say the government's repressive policies in Xinjiang, including controls on Islam, have provoked unrest, a claim Beijing denies.Courts in Xinjiang had sentenced 113 people to jail terms ranging from 10 years to life for terrorist activities and other crimes, the Xinjiang government said.The sentences were handed down on Wednesday by courts in 11 counties and cities in the Kashgar region, Xinjiang's official Tianshan news website said late on Sunday.It did not identify the ethnicity of those sentenced, but they had Uighur names.Those sentenced were accused of crimes such as ""being involved in organizing, leading and participating in a terrorist organization, inciting ethnic hatred and ethnic discrimination"", bigamy, drug trafficking, robbery among other crimes, the Tianshan news report said.There is now a ""competitive race"" among various areas to arrest and sentence Uighurs, Dilxat Raxit, spokesman for the World Uyghur Congress, the largest group of exiled Uighurs, said in an email.""Uighurs who have revolted and expressed dissatisfaction against China's repression are now accused of terrorism,"" Raxit said.At least 380 people have been detained in the last month in a sweeping crackdown on violence in Xinjiang.State media last month reported a public mass sentencing, reminiscent of China's revolutionary era rallies, attracting a crowd of 7,000 at a sports stadium in Yining city in the northern prefecture of Yili.Around 200 people have died in unrest in Xinjiang in the past year or so, the government says, including 13 people shot dead by police in an attack on a police station in mid-June.

(AP Photo/Alex Brandon)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb765d51f0000df002503d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Alex Morgan is everywhere: from winning Olympic gold with the U.S. women's soccer team to beaming on your box of Cocoa Pebbles to making the New York Times' bestsellers list to posing for Sports Illustrated's swimsuit issue. Just days after scoring twice in an international friendly against France, we found her in Miami Beach talking to kids about staying active and healthy, part of a program with Olympic sponsors McDonald's and Coca Cola. She'll also read them a section of her latest book ""Kicks: Sabotage Season,"" part of a three-book series aimed at young girls. Then it's back to Oregon with the Portland Thorns of the National Women's Soccer League, before training begins in earnest for the 2015 Women's World Cup in Canada. ""I'm really happy with where our team is right now,"" she says of the U.S., who aim to win their first World Cup since 1999. Oh yeah, and Morgan's also planning a wedding to Servando Carrasco of Major League Soccer's Houston Dynamo. Clearly, America's star forward is back at full speed after being sidelined for months with a left ankle injury. You're here talking to kids, and you've just put out your third book geared toward young girls. What about working with kids directly is the most fun for you?  It's the most fulfilling part about what I do. When I was younger and wanted to be a professional soccer player, I didn't know what that meant -- I thought it just meant playing soccer every day. There's really so much more to that. There's those young girls that I once was, looking up to Mia Hamm, Christine Lilly, all those players, and I know how much of an effect they had on me. Knowing that, I feel like I'm in a position where I can really help be a positive influence in girls' lives. I put out the books because I don't think there's enough for girls' soccer out there. I don't think there's enough for girls' sports, period. It's important to take on that responsibility and try to be a positive influence, impact them in a good way, and let them know that if they do want to become a women's professional soccer player, or [become a professional] in women's sports when they grow up, they can achieve that dream. When you were that age, was there somebody that gave you good advice that you always remembered?  My dad has been to every soccer game that I've played in, both at the amateur level and at the professional level, and he always had great things to say whether we won or we lost, whether I felt great or not so great. I am where I am today because of my parents and their support, because my dad really encouraged me and because he felt like I was deserving of the stepping stones that I took to get where I am. You obviously don't get a whole lot of down time, between your club play, the national team, and events like this. What do you do to recharge? I really love to do yoga. Sometimes I forget about myself, forget about what I need and the calmness that I need at times. Yoga helps me just calm down and think about where I am in my life and the fact that I'm only 25 years old and that I still have so much of my life to live. I also love reading, and I love just being with my family. Most of the time when I see them, it's because I have a soccer game -- they're on vacation while I'm playing soccer, so when I actually get to relax with them, it's the best kind of rehab and therapy for me. Is yoga something you do alone in a hotel room, or are you able to find classes on the road?  I always try to find a class, wherever it is. And on the national team, we have a massage therapist who's actually a certified yoga instructor, so they know how important it is for us. And whatever city I'm in, I think you can always take an hour out of your day to give yourself some time. There's an endless media debate about the U.S. as a soccer nation -- whether it could be, how much of one is it? What do you think we do right, and what would you love to see improve?  I think there's good support for MLS and NWSL; I think it could always be better. We see so many more fans this World Cup than previous World Cups, but that doesn't always translate into the MLS, that doesn't always translate to soccer here in the U.S. The World Cup comes around once every four years; it's not like the Super Bowl, it's not like the World Series. I love the fact that people are coming together and celebrating the World Cup together, because that's really what soccer's all about: it's celebrating all different cultures, all different languages into one sport. That's really why I love the sport, but I think there's a long ways to go for the U.S. to become a soccer country. You see glimpses of it, but I wouldn't necessarily say that this is a soccer country. Speaking of the men's World Cup, what's been your favorite match so far?  The Brazil-Chile game in the round of 16 was stressful, amazing. Beautiful soccer was played in that game. I had so much fun as a fan watching that game. I really do believe that the U.S. men's team has a great team going into the World Cup. A lot of people doubted them, but I felt from day one they were getting out of their bracket. I even made my own bracket and had them coming out, and now that they face Belgium I think they have a great opportunity to make it to the quarters. I'm really proud of our guys, because the better that they do the more fans I think the U.S. will gain in MLS and with women's soccer, the NWSL. I think they're really taking hold of soccer and doing great things with it. If you had to play a game with Kyle Beckerman's hair or Tim Howard's hair...? Kyle Beckerman's hair. I think it's awesome. And although I love Tim Howard, I don't think the bald look looks good on me. You have A LOT going on. What's the most stressful part of planning a wedding?  Probably trying to take on too much on my own. My fiancé knows me really well and he knows that although I don't want to do everything, I want everything to be done my way. So with that in mind, I need to let go of the reins a little. My sister has helped me so much, my fiancé wants to help me a lot more. I need to give up trying to make it exactly how I want it and know that my first job is playing soccer and that wedding planning is fun, not stressful! At this time next year, the women's World Cup will be underway in Canada. Obviously qualification still has to happen, but at what point do you get nervous?  I don't think nervous would be the right word, but I always have butterflies before each game. Leading up to the World Cup we have a sendoff series just like the men did. We'll have those games and that'll make it really feel real, like it's around the corner. I don't think that it'll feel completely real until we're at the venue of our first game. But preparation starts now. We were one of the last teams to qualify [for the 2011 World Cup]; we had to go to Italy to qualify. So we're not taking it lightly this time. How's the ankle?  The ankle feels really good. I don't feel it at all anymore, so moving forward I'm not thinking about my injury, I'm thinking about how I can be my best self for World Cup. "

Rallies and parties happened all across the country when it was announced that same-sex couples in California were allowed to marry and that federal rights would be granted to all legally married same-sex couples. Since then, we have seen a slew of state and federal courts reaffirming the right of all loving couples to marry. Last week, President Obama announced that he will sign a much-anticipated executive order to protect LGBTQ workers from employment discrimination at companies that have contracts with the federal government. It would seem that things are looking up for the LGBTQ community.However, most issues of inequality for LGBTQ folks have not seen the light of the day. Even with extremely broad and dangerous religious exemptions, the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) has been stalled in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives after its passage in the Senate. Other issues like housing, public accommodations, and homelessness have barely even been mentioned. As matter of fact, most LGBTQ people and our allies don't know that in most states people can be denied services just because they are or are perceived to be LGBTQ. We can get evicted from our homes because of our sexual orientation or gender identity. We can get fired from our jobs because of who we are or whom we love.This is why 40 percent of all homeless youth identify as LGBTQ -- our community is kicked out of our homes and onto the streets at dramatically disproportionate rates. Nearly 90 percent of transgender people face harassment at work, and same-sex African-American couples are twice as likely to live under the poverty line than their heterosexual counterparts. Just last month, a gay couple was kicked out of a Texas restaurant, and Catholic teachers in Ohio are being forced to sign a contract outlining that they can't support LGBTQ rights in their private lives.Today is the last day of Pride Month. While some LGBTQ people spent their weekend at parades and a few LGBTQ leaders are attending a cocktail party at the White House, our community continues to suffer -- often invisibly. Although it is important for LGBTQ people to take the time to celebrate our progress, we can't forget that our rights will not be won over cocktails. It's our duty to pass on a world to the next generation that's better than the one we inherited. As LGBTQ people we don't have a choice -- we need to fight to survive and thrive in a country in which laws don't protect us.Without question, we are facing an ever-present crisis -- and President Obama has the opportunity to solidify his legacy by creating a clear vision for full federal LGBTQ equality.We are calling on President Obama to take yet another historic step towards the liberation of LGBTQ people and to reaffirm his place in the halls of history. As we approach midterm elections and as he approaches the second half of his second term in office, we need him more than ever to show leadership by creating a clear vision for full LGBTQ equality under the law. LGBTQ people in too many places in the United States live under the overwhelming weight of oppression. When our states deny us life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, we have no other choice but to turn to our federal government. The fight for LGBTQ equality doesn't begin on June 1st and end on June 30th -- it will not end until we're fully equal under the law. It will not end until our humanity is respected.

But Texas may have to slash a smaller amount of its emissions under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's proposed Clean Power Plan, while Washington State would have to cut the highest percentage of CO2 emissions of any state in the U.S.How the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reached the Clean Power Plan's CO2 emissions reduction goal for each state is somewhat mysterious, experts say, with answers buried in a complex formula that doesn't clearly detail why each state would have to slash its carbon dioxide emissions to a certain level under the plan. The Clean Power Plan, unveiled June 2, is the Obama administration's plan to require states to find ways to slash CO2 emissions from existing power plants that operate on fossil fuels. The goal is for the U.S. as a whole to see its fossil fuel-fired power plant CO2 emissions reduced to 30 percent below 2005 levels by 2030. Texas' power plants emitted 232.3 million metric tons of CO2 in 2012 — more than double the CO2 emissions of the three other biggest CO2 emitters: Florida, Indiana and Pennsylvania, EPA data show. And, Texas leads the nation in overall greenhouse gas emissions. The Clean Power Plan calls for Texas to cut its existing power plant CO2 emissions by about 39 percent by 2030, reducing its 2012 emissions rate from 1,298 pounds of CO2 emissions per megawatt hour to 791 pounds.Likewise, the plan calls for Indiana to slash its power plant emissions by 20 percent, Pennsylvania by 32 percent and Florida by 38 percent. All of those cuts are about average for EPA state emissions cuts goals. But the EPA is calling for the biggest cuts in power plant CO2 emissions to come from a state with one of the tiniest carbon footprints — Washington State.Washington ranks near the bottom of the list of greenhouse gas emitting states and has a power plant CO2 emissions rate of only 763 pounds per megawatt hour — the nation’s fifth lowest behind California, Maine, Idaho and Vermont. Washington’s power plants emitted about 6.1 million metric tons of CO2 in 2012. Only Idaho and Maine emit less CO2 from their power plants, and Vermont isn’t included in the Clean Power Plan because it has no power plants running on fossil fuels. The reasons the Clean Power Plan calls for Washington and more polluting states such as South Carolina to cut more CO2 emissions than Texas are complicated and based on the four “building blocks” the EPA used to calculate each state’s unique emissions cut goal. The first two “building blocks” include how much the EPA believes each state can reasonably make its coal-fired power plants more efficient and increase the use of natural gas-fired power plants as a way to offset the use of coal. Another block asseses a state's ability to increase the use of energy sources that emit no CO2, including wind, solar and nuclear. The last building block considers how consumers can use energy more efficiently, helping to reduce electric power demand. Using those four factors, the EPA used publicly available energy data to create the formula it used to set each state’s emissions reduction goal. “This doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s easier for one state or more difficult for another (to reduce emissions),” EPA acting assistant administrator Janet McCabe said in a statement. “It just means that each state’s goal reflects its potential to reduce pollution from its own unique starting point.” According to an analysis by the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions, or C2ES, the EPA is calling for Texas to reduce 20 percent of its CO2 emissions by displacing its use of coal plants with more frequent use of combined-cycle natural gas-fired power plants. Despite being the nation’s biggest CO2 emitter, Texas is already ahead of other states in producing electricity from sources other than coal. Texas produces more wind power than any other state, and natural gas is the state’s chief source of electricity. The EPA wants to see the state reduce its CO2 emissions by about 9 percent by using even more renewables and by an additional 20 percent by using more natural gas for power generation. Reductions in consumer power demand and increases in energy efficiency account for about 5.5 percent of Texas’ CO2 emissions reduction goal. The agency is calling for Washington State to increase its use of renewables enough to account for nearly 20 percent of its CO2 emissions reduction goal. The state already uses more hydropower than any other state, and coal power makes up only a tiny share of its total electricity generation. Most of the goal would be achieved by using more natural gas to produce electricity. EPA officials did not answer questions about how the agency arrived at each state's CO2 emissions reduction goal. EPA Media Relations Director George Hull told Climate Central that EPA officials and scientists can speak to journalists about technical details of the plan only on “background,” a practice of providing information that cannot be quoted directly or attributed to a specific source. Doug Vine, C2ES senior energy fellow, said the EPA’s reasoning for setting differing CO2 emissions goals for each state is based on many factors, but ultimately, it’s unclear how the agency reached its conclusions. “To explain how different states wound up with different targets, I think it’s a little bit of a mystery,” he said. The general strategy the EPA used to reach each state’s goal is fairly clear, he said. Using its own data, the EPA factored in how each coal-fired power plant could be managed better to become more efficient, and how some states can use more renewables and their natural gas power plants more often. Natural gas-fired power plants often supplement coal power at times of high electricity demand. “They’re not being used 24/7,” Vine said. “In some states, they’re being used less than 50 percent of the time. They’re setting what they believe is a realistic goal: You can use natural gas plants up to 70 percent of the time.” But some states, such as Kentucky, which would need to cut only 18 percent of its CO2 emissions to meet its goal, have very few natural gas power plants available to them. “Kentucky is nearly 98 percent coal,” Vine said. “They don’t have a lot of opportunity to make that switch.” South Carolina, which would have to reduce its emissions by about 51 percent under the Clean Power Plan, has nuclear reactors expected to become operational by 2019, and Washington has a coal-fired power plant likely to be shuttered by then — all possible factors in the EPA’s CO2 reduction goal calculations, Vine said. With Washington using so much hydropower, Texas using so much wind power and others using so much coal power with few alternatives at their disposal, each state has a different starting point for reducing emissions that makes sense on paper but seems “skewed” when considering a state’s overall CO2 emissions, he said. “Those things will have to be worked through,” he said. “There’s still a fair amount of mystery in there.” Barring delays caused by legal challenges, the EPA is expecting to finalize the Clean Power Plan by mid-2015. Public comments are being taken until October after public hearings on the plan scheduled throughout the country in July."

It added that their corpses were still on view.The Observatory said clashes between rival Islamist groups in Syria had killed around 7,000 people since January, as militants from ISIL try to strengthen their grip on territory.The infighting has complicated the insurgency and drawn in foreign fighters.ISIL, a radical al Qaeda offshoot group, has captured areas on both sides of the Iraqi-Syrian border after seizing the Iraqi city of Mosul on June 10 and sweeping towards Baghdad.In Syria, ISIL has battled with groups such as the Nusra Front, al Qaeda's official Syrian wing, in the uprising against President Bashar al-Assad which started with pro-democracy protests but has descended into civil war.The Observatory, an anti-Assad group which tracks the violence, said the vast majority were killed in explosions, including car bombings and suicide attacks. It monitored the infighting in seven provinces.It said ISIL had executed the eight men in Aleppo province for belonging to more moderate groups. The men were crucified in the town square of Deir Hafer in eastern Aleppo and would be left there for three days, it said.The men were accused of being ""Sahwa"" fighters, the Observatory said, a term ISIL uses to refer to rival combatants whom it accuses of being controlled by Western powers.ISIL also crucified another man in the province in al-Bab town near the Turkish border, it said. He was pinned up for eight hours as a punishment for giving false testimony but survived the ordeal, the Observatory said.ISIL, a rebranding of al Qaeda in Iraq which fought American forces during the U.S. occupation, has been disowned by the al Qaeda leadership, partly because of its brutality and indiscriminate attacks.The group has alienated many civilians and opposition activists by imposing harsh rulings against dissent, even beheading its opponents, in areas it controls.ISIL follows al Qaeda's hard-line ideology but draws its strength from foreign fighters, battle-hardened from Iraq.The military gains by ISIL have highlighted how the conflict in Iraq is intertwined with the civil war in Syria, where more than 160,000 people have been killed.On Saturday, Islamist rebels fought back in Syria's border town of Albu Kamal, challenging the hold of ISIL.ISIL fighters had appeared to be consolidating their hold over Albu Kamal during the week when the local leader of the rival Nusra Front pledged allegiance to them.ISIL, which wants to create a severe Islamic state that straddles international borders, controls much of Syria's eastern oil-producing Euphrates River region.Its lightning gains in Iraq's Sunni Muslim northern and western provinces over the last three weeks mean ISIL now commands a large cross-border expanse of land.

On this final day of the term, the Court will be handing down a decision with potentially broad implications not only for the rights of women and workers, but also for corporate personhood and religious liberty.The Court will confront these issues in Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, Inc., and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp v. Burwell, two related cases that challenge the Affordable Care Act's requirement that most company insurance plans must cover the full range of FDA-approved contraceptives. The owners of the companies challenging the contraception coverage provision argue that requiring their companies to provide coverage for certain forms of contraception violates their religious beliefs. They have sued for an exemption from the ACA contraception coverage requirement under a law, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), that protects religious free exercise rights as they have been protected under the First Amendment for the first 200 or so years of our nation's history. Never in those more than 200 years have corporations like Hobby Lobby been understood to share in the right of the free exercise of religion, and for good reason -- our nation's protection of religious liberty has been seen as a personal right, inextricably linked to the human capacity to express devotion to a God and act on the basis of reason and conscience. Business corporations, obviously, lack the basic human capacities -- reason, dignity and conscience -- at the core of the right to free exercise of religion. Certainly some incorporated entities, such as churches and other houses of worship, are given free exercise protections (and religious organizations are, in fact, given exemptions from the contraception coverage mandate). But both the law and common sense tell us that there is an important difference between a church and a for-profit corporation formed to engage in commerce. From the employee's perspective, this difference is plain: when you sign up to work for a nationwide craft store or cabinet maker -- or burger joint, airline, or big-box store -- you likely wouldn't expect to be subject to the religious beliefs of the owners of the company that employs you, as opposed to an employee hired to teach religion and other classes at an explicitly religious school. The religious free-exercise claims of Hobby Lobby's owners turn first principles of religious freedom, as well as fundamental tenets of corporate law, on their head. Hobby Lobby's owners want their to have their cake and eat it, too: they want all the benefits of operating through the corporate form but none of the responsibilities. In the balance are the rights of Hobby Lobby's employees, women and their families who risk losing important health benefits they are legally entitled to under the Affordable Care Act.Supporters of the Affordable Care Act had reason to celebrate two years ago when, in another ruling handed down by the Court on the very last day of the Supreme Court Term, a majority of the Court upheld the ACA as constitutional. If the Justices follow more than 200 years of constitutional law and history, not to mention basic principles of corporate law, the Court should hand another victory to Obamacare. Of course, whether they will or not is another matter. Either way, we'll find out soon enough how this year's Obamacare sequel turns out."

The 25-year-old forward entrusted with Mexico's No. 10 shirt, managed to get off a blistering left-footed shot while surrounded by a trio of Dutch defenders outside of the penalty area. The low drive beat diving Dutch goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen to the corner near his left post and gave Mexico a 1-0 lead. On the sideline, Mexico coach Miguel Herrera did what he does so well: He went wild. "

She later admitted the statement ""may have not been the most artful.""Clinton's husband defended her, telling NBC's David Gregory that ""she's not out of touch"" during an interview in Denver earlier this week.""She advocated and worked as a senator for things that were good for ordinary people. And before that, all her life,"" he said.Republican National Chairman Reince Priebus blasted Clinton for her comments on Sunday.""I think that when you are perceived as being out of touch with people that are struggling, with people that are out there working hard, I don't think that flying on private jets and collecting $250,000 for a speech is considered to be hard work,"" Priebus said on ""Meet The Press.""""I think people are kind of tired of this show, quite frankly. There's Hillary fatigue already out there setting in,"" he continued, predicting that Clinton's ""early run for the White House"" would work against her.Asked by David Gregory whether he'd have the same message for the Bush family, Priebus demurred.""I don't think Jeb and the Bushes are being as obnoxious about all of this,"" he said.The NBC/WSJ/Annenberg poll surveyed 592 Americans between June 26 and June 28, using live interviews conducted over both landlines and cell phones."

BATTLEGROUND TEXASFor her staunchest supporters, the key to victory rests with Texans being targeted in one of the largest, state-wide grassroots campaigns in U.S. political history.Alumni from President Barack Obama's 2012 campaign quietly have built a Democratic political army in Texas, where gun-rights advocates brandish semi-automatic rifles on city streets and pickup trucks bear ""SECEDE"" bumper stickers.The group called Battleground Texas, started about a year and a half ago, has enlisted about 20,000 volunteers who have made 2 million phone calls and house visits among voters.""People are hungry. They see the opportunity and they want to take it,"" said Jenn Brown, the group's executive director.In a state as large as Texas, adding a few percentage points with groups that typically favor Democrats but have not turned out in high numbers could mean all the difference.According to a poll by survey group Latino Decisions, 39 percent of eligible Hispanics cast ballots in the November 2012 election in Texas, while 61 percent stayed home. The numbers were almost reversed for non-Hispanic whites.By 2030 Latinos, who typically support Democrats, will be the majority in Texas and could turn the state blue. Texas could then join populous California and New York among Democratic strongholds, with the three states securing the party nearly half the electoral votes needed to win the White House.Democrats have also become emboldened by the strength of U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and his no-compromise tea party allies, seeing them as driving moderate Republicans into their tent and antagonizing Hispanic voters with their hardline stance on immigration.""We have seen Republicans consistently move further to the right and as they are excluding people from the promise of Texas, our job is to speed up those changes,"" said Will Hailer, executive director of the Texas Democratic Party.
