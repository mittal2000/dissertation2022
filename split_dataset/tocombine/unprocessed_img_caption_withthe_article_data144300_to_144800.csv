Previously a regional",2013-09-04,"Citi Bikes are stored in a rack in New York's Herald Square, Friday, May 31, 2013. The nation's biggest bicycle-sharing program got rolling Monday, as thousands of New Yorkers got their first chance to ride a network billed as a new form of public transit in a city known for it. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d7a262400003000951820.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's been an eventful summer, hasn't it? We've won great legal battles with the repeal of DOMA and the judicial rejection of New York's Stop And Frisk policy. We've faced difficulties, like the distressing conclusion of the Zimmerman trial. But just as there has been news in the realms of politics, those of us on the health beat have been pretty busy, too. There was big news and small (Prancercise, anyone?), and we loved covering it all. Here are some of Summer 2013's biggest moments in health. Anything to add? Tell us in the comments!Citi Bike One morning in late May, New Yorkers woke up to find a new presence in the city: a fleet of an estimated 6,000 new bikes, housed on racks around the city as part of America's largest bike-sharing program. While the project was met with some skepticism, residents and tourists alike have taken to it. According to an estimate on Citi Bike's site, as of August 26, the program's bikers have traveled a total of 5,550,424 miles. Not bad, NYC. DOMA OK, we're claiming this one. Not only is marriage good for you, but teens (not just gay teens -- all teens) who grow up in accepting, gay-friendly communities are less likely to experience depression and thoughts of suicide. Now, as one big gay-friendly nation, united under a federal ruling (or, at least, trying to be), we can look forward to improved mental health for all. Wendy Davis Not very many people outside of Texas had heard of state Senator Wendy Davis until one fateful evening in June, when the Fort Worth rep stood in the state senate house and delivered an 11-hour filibuster in an effort to stop the vote on a restrictive abortion bill. Although the bill eventually passed, she spotlighted the struggle of poor and underserved Texan women in their efforts to seek affordable and accessible medical care. And she had some pretty rad pink Mizunos. Prancercise On the other end of the, uh, historical-importance spectrum was Prancercise, a failed '80s-era exercise regime resurfaced on YouTube, to the delight and amusement of viral-video watchers the Internet over. But before you pooh-pooh this exercise routine, which takes its influence from the movement of horses, consider that it may actually be beneficial -- especially compared to sitting around on the couch. So make like an equid and prance!Cronut Burger  While the blockbuster pastry of the summer -- the croissant-doughnut hybrid called the ""cronut"" -- is decidedly not a health story, we will lay claim to the recent news out of Toronto that as many as 79 foodies contracted food poisoning from ""cronut burgers."" And in so doing, they quite literally acted out our feelings about high-calorie food chimeras. Plan B The Food and Drug Administration's plan to widen access to the morning-after pill to all ages was stalled in 2011 in an unprecedented overruling by the Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. But this June, a judge struck down Sebelius' order, allowing the FDA to move forward with approved sales for all ages. Google Glass Surgery We tend to associate Google Glass with nerdy white guys.  (Can you blame us?) But the technology could have a very practical, educational, and even life-saving role in teaching hospitals. This summer marked the first two medical procedures in which the operating physician was able to share his work and perspective by recording it with Google Glass. Kale Kale Kale Kale You ate it, we ate it. Everybody ate it. McD's Went Veg Just under the wire, McDonald's debuted two new vegetarian wraps at the end of August. Previously a regional consideration in countries like India where a majority of the population is vegetarian, McDonald's decided to expand the offerings elsewhere -- starting with Canada. And while, like everything under the Golden Arches, they weren't exactly healthy, the move can be seen as an acknowledgment of the 5 percent of Americans who go meatless -- and the overall recognition that plant-based meals are an often integral part of a healthy-eating plan.

Whether these home chefs double as actors, singers, or any other type of high-profile personality, food is a priority in their lives. In each cookbook that a celebrity writes, their relationship with food is often an integral part of the story -- these cookbooks are partly stories about how to make their favorite recipes, but they're also about the celebrities themselves, and the influence of food in their lives.Click here to see Our 10 Favorite Celebrity CookbooksSome cookbooks follow a special diet, like Gwyneth Paltrow's ""elimination-diet"" plan in It's All Good, where she explains the ideas behind the clean food movement, as well as shares her most-loved recipes with readers. Alicia Silverstone follows a similar cue by selling the benefits of veganism, of which she has become an iconic figure since publishing The Kind Diet.RELATED: 10 Cookbooks Everybody Should HaveThe increasing number of health-conscious cookbooks is a sign of the times. As obesity has increasingly become an issue, some celebrity authors are making an effort to spread a message of health awareness while offering engaging new ideas to eat foods that benefit the body -- and sometimes mind -- without compromising on taste.RELATED: 16 Inspiring Celebrity KitchensOther cookbooks take the more conventional route of following a national cuisine, like Stanley Tucci's The Tucci Cookbook and Tony Danza's Don't Fill Up on the Antipasto, which both explore Italian cooking alongside their family rituals of cooking and eating together. Both celebrity families have deep roots in Italian traditions and food is a key element to their relationships, memories, and legacies for future generations.The range of cookbooks written by celebrities has made it possible for cooks and readers to incorporate these editions into various diets and food libraries. Readers will likely have at least one of three motivations to read a celebrity's cookbook: They already love the celebrity behind it, they want to learn how to make new dishes, or they aspire to adopt a new lifestyle diet.Whether you'd like to shift your diet into high-gear, want to know how to incorporate healthier foods into it, or whether you simply want to learn how to cook a wider variety of cuisines, a celebrity will certainly have a cookbook that will help you along the way.- Victoria Barton, The Daily MealMore from The Daily Meal: 101 Best Farmers' Markets in America 10 Iconic Recipes That Define America Rock Your Bake Sale: 10 New Recipes 15 Great Grilled Chicken Recipes"

Researchers found that couples who married before September 11, 2001 were 28 percent more likely to divorce within three years of marriage if one or both spouses experienced a deployment to Afghanistan or Iraq that lasted at least one year.Couples who married after the 9/11 attacks experienced a lower divorce rate than those who married prior to September 11, 2001. The researchers speculate that this is because those who married post-9/11 were better equipped to deal with the difficulties of war.Regardless of when the military couple married or when the deployment occurred, researchers found that more cumulative months of deployment increased the divorce risk. Ninety-seven percent of the divorces studied occurred after a return from deployment. Women were more likely to divorce than male service members following deployment, and military families with children were less likely to divorce following deployment.This isn't the first study to look at the military divorce rate. In 2011, USA Today found that the military divorce rate was at the highest level since 1999, and according to the Department of Defense, it has been rising steadily for the past ten years.Click through the slideshow below for more interesting divorce findings.Keep in touch!

But one of the hardest adjustments is getting used to the hectic schedule that back-to-school throws us into. Gone are the leisurely mornings of summer; and back are the chaotic 6 a.m. wake-up calls where no one seems to be able to find their shoes. And just like that, breakfast becomes an impossible task again. We understand how hard it is to get everyone off to where they need to be AND make sure they've had a healthy breakfast. That's why we've put together a collection of not 10, not 20, but 100 recipes that will hopefully help make this school year so much easier. We have recipes that you can quickly make in the morning; recipes you can prepare the night (or even weekend) before to store in the freezer until you need them.
