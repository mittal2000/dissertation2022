Neither the school nor Old Row identified which house hung the banner.After even more anti-LSU banners popped up on game day, Alabama's vice president of student affairs, David Grady, addressed the issue in a series of tweets: Banners have appeared around [Tuscaloosa] that contain offensive messages that are not representative of our University, students or football team. A spokesman for the University of Alabama said in a statement that ""it has not been determined who hung the banner at an off-campus apartment complex,"" but that any student who violates the school's code of conduct may face disciplinary action, regardless of whether the violation takes place on or off campus. CORRECTION: This story previously stated that the banner was hung by a fraternity. It's unclear who the responsible students were and whether they were affiliated with any university group.Also on HuffPost:"

And whatever the result, Myanmar is heading into a period of uncertainty over how she and other ascendant parties negotiate sharing power with the still-dominant military.A pariah state until a few years ago, Myanmar has had little experience organizing elections. Some 10,000 observers were enlisted to scrutinize the process. Early indications from the monitors were that voting was mostly trouble-free, with only isolated irregularities.""From the dozens of people we have spoken to since 6 a.m. today, everybody feels they have been able to vote for whoever they wanted to in security and safety,"" said Durudee Sirichanya, one of the international observers.In the city of Mandalay, about 100 people were stopped from voting after officials discovered they were outsiders who had been mysteriously added to the register and then bussed to the polling station.A REFERENDUM ON REFORMThe main concern about the election's fairness arose before the election. Activists estimated that up to 4 million people, mostly citizens working abroad, would not be able to vote.Religious tension, fanned by Buddhist nationalists whose actions have intimidated Myanmar's Muslim minority, also marred the election campaign. Among those excluded from voting were around a million Rohingya Muslims who are effectively stateless in their own land.Still, there was excitement among voters about the first general election since a quasi-civilian government replaced military rule in 2011, which was widely seen as a referendum on the country's unsteady reform process.""I've done my bit for change, for the emergence of democracy,"" said Daw Myint, a 55-year-old former teacher, after she cast her vote for the NLD in Yangon.Suu Kyi's car inched through a scrum of news photographers outside the polling station in Yangon where the 70-year-old Nobel peace laureate came to vote.She was stony-faced as bodyguards shouted at people to move aside, but a jubilant cry of ""Victory! Victory!"" went up from the crowd of well-wishers as she went inside.Many voters doubted the military would accept the outcome of the vote if the NLD wins.But in the capital, Naypyitaw, military Commander-in-Chief Min Aung Hlaing said there would be no repeat of the last free vote in 1990, when Suu Kyi won but the army ignored the result. She spent most of the next 20 years under house arrest before her release in 2010.""If the people choose them (the NLD), there is no reason we would not accept it,"" the senior general told reporters.""VERY SILLY"" CONSTITUTIONResults from the election are expected to come in slowly, with a clear overall picture not likely to emerge until Tuesday morning.Suu Kyi is barred from taking the presidency herself by provisions of a constitution written by the junta to preserve its power.But if she wins a majority and is able to form Myanmar's first democratically elected government since the early 1960s, Suu Kyi says she will be the power behind the new president regardless of a constitution she has derided as ""very silly.""Suu Kyi started the contest with a sizeable handicap: even if the vote is deemed free and fair, one-quarter of parliament's seats will still be held by unelected military officers.To form a government and choose its own president, the NLD on its own or with allies must win more than two-thirds of all seats up for grabs. The ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party would need far fewer seats if it secured the backing of the military bloc in parliament.However, many voters were expected to spurn the USDP, created by the former junta and led by former military officers, because it is linked with the brutal dictatorship that installed President Thein Sein's nominally civilian government in 2011.An inconclusive result could thrust some of the 91 parties contesting the election, including many representing Myanmar's myriad ethnic minorities, into a king-maker role.Even if the NLD is victorious, the military will retain significant power. It is guaranteed key ministerial positions, the constitution gives it the right to take over the government under certain circumstances, and it also has a grip on the economy through holding companies.(Additional reporting by Aung Hla Tun, Andrew Marshall, Aubrey Belford, Simon Webb and Timothy McLaughlin; Writing by John Chalmers; Editing by Larry King)Also on HuffPost:"

Since then, confrontations have increased. So far, 11 Israelis have been killed, mostly in stabbings, while 55 Palestinians, 35 of them identified by Israel as attackers, have been killed by Israeli fire.Bringing together Jewish and Arab students is a revolutionary idea in Israel, where children usually register for schools along demographic lines — Arab, secular Jewish or religious Jewish. And it appears to be gaining traction.When Hand in Hand opened its Jaffa branch — the newest of five schools — three years ago, 35 Arab and Jewish students attended. Today, enrollment is 170, split almost evenly between Arabs and Jews, and applicants are expected to grow each year.Each class has two teachers — one Arabic-speaking and one Hebrew-speaking — and students learn to master both languages. The schools mark all Jewish, Muslim and Christian holidays.Anat Itzhaki, director of the Jaffa branch, said teachers and parents welcome complicated issues, such as how to handle sensitive dates like Israeli Independence Day and “Nakba” Day, when Palestinians commemorate of the “catastrophe” they say was the creation of the state of Israel.The school is vital for the community and parents — who understand their 5-year-olds may not yet grasp the implications of their ethnic, religious or national identities — to show that it is possible to “be together, while still different, and learn about each other,” Chamy said.A PTA meeting last week functioned as a kind of support group, where parents expressed mutual feelings of frustration and despair over the growing violence. One Arab parent spoke about how one of her relatives had been doused with acid, and another about how a relative was fired from work because she expressed support for Palestinians.Hand in Hand sought a different approach last week when Tel Aviv and three other Israeli cities barred the mostly Arab custodial staff from campuses during school hours for security reasons. The Jaffa branch brought cakes for its janitors as a sign of solidarity and to show appreciation.Israeli-Palestinian coexistence projects have been around for decades, from groups like Combatants for Peace — which brought together former Israeli soldiers and former Palestinian militants — to Seeds of Peace — which placed Israeli and Palestinian children in summer camps in Israel and abroad — and a long list of Israeli-Palestinian magazines, dialogue programs and economic initiatives.Seeds for Peace introduced a follow-up program in March for its 5,000 graduates, more than half of whom are now leaders in their fields, and one in five of whom are working in the coexistence movement, according to studies by the group’s former Middle East program director, Ned Lazarus.Even though Jaffa is known for its liberal politics and large activist community, such initiatives remain important because segregation poses a threat, said Dafna Kaplan, a photographer and Jewish Israeli mother at the Hand in Hand School. Since the recent spike in violence, she said her daughter — who studies at another school in Jaffa — for the first time referred to Palestinians as “dirty Arabs.”“This is the only sane place,” Kaplan said about Hand in Hand. “But also I feel like it’s a mission. You have to create it. It won’t happen by itself.”Kaplan’s doing just that by spearheading a project to show the diversity of voices in the community. She’s taking a series of photos of those connected to the school and will project them on a clock tower in town, along with a paragraph about their stories.While parents are eager to foster mutual understanding during these tense times, it’s easy to see a sense of normalcy back at the school’s playground when Jewish and Arab children go to class together.“It’s fun to know other languages because then you can speak with all kinds of people!” exclaims Ofri Druckman, 5, as two of her friends, one Arab, one Jewish, nod in agreement, before they all resume playing on the wooden jungle gym.Also on HuffPost:"

You have to create it. It won’t happen by itself.”Kaplan’s doing just that by spearheading a project to show the diversity of voices in the community. She’s taking a series of photos of those connected to the school and will project them on a clock tower in town, along with a paragraph about their stories.While parents are eager to foster mutual understanding during these tense times, it’s easy to see a sense of normalcy back at the school’s playground when Jewish and Arab children go to class together.“It’s fun to know other languages because then you can speak with all kinds of people!” exclaims Ofri Druckman, 5, as two of her friends, one Arab, one Jewish, nod in agreement, before they all resume playing on the wooden jungle gym.Also on HuffPost:"

Nina Rothe, ContributorCultural Activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-chef-the-designer-the_b_8502720.html,"Dubai -- like the Manhattan of Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat -- is a land of visionaries and pioneers, but also a megalopolis that is achieving its stellar place on the jet setting world map at dizzying speeds.",2015-11-08,2015-11-08-1446974980-9392400-ThePalaceDowntownDubaiFai2.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-11-08-1446974980-9392400-ThePalaceDowntownDubaiFai2-thumb.jpg," The Palace Downtown with the Dubai Fountain in the backgroundWhen American movie star Chris Pine called Dubai the ""Future-land"" during a press conference earlier this year, I finally found within his observation the perfect way of describing a feeling I've had for some time now. Whenever I'm in Dubai, this marvelous city of possibilities, I feel like I used to feel in N.Y.C., in my early days there. Because Dubai -- like the Manhattan of Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat -- is a land of visionaries and pioneers, but also a megalopolis that is achieving its stellar place on the jet setting world map at dizzying speeds. No other place does is better, bigger and faster. And nowhere is this more apparent than in its Downtown district. If you want a five-star plus luxury hotel, that is where to book. If you want the latest designers clothing, you step into The Dubai Mall. If you want to eat at world class restaurants, savoring dishes created by Michelin star chefs, this is where you book your table. The choices are endless and the possibilities, limitless. Even when you think you've done it all in Dubai, there will be a new restaurant opening up, a trendy designer will install their flagship store here, or you'll discover that a world-class celebrity chef has moved to the city from Paris, London or New York City. Recently, everything I love in life -- fashion, food, glamour and fun -- came together in one place, under one roof I already adore, The Dubai Mall, in this hotbed of activity and excitement. The end of October saw the second edition of the Vogue Fashion Dubai Experience taking place in the fashion capital of the Middle East and I kick myself for having missed it. But with the help of a few friends in the right places and the willingness of three master chefs to step outside their comfort zone, I managed to find a way to celebrate glamour and gourmet, in my own very special way. Chef Steve Deconinck, Executive Chef of The Palace Downtown DubaiAt The Palace Downtown Dubai, I found in the figure of their Executive Chef Steve Deconinck a magnificently inventive soul. Of course, the hotel itself had me at ""hello"", from the moment I stepped into their Arabian-inspired lobby, complete with central water fountain and the fragrance of exotic flowers in the air. And I can't wait to go back for some spa treatments and another Palace cappuccino, which came complete with 24-carat gold leaf and four scrumptious, perfectly chilled macarons. But I digress, which is easy to do when surrounded by the understated grandeur of the place. The Palace Cappuccino comes complete with 24K, edible gold leaf In advance of my visit, chef Steve was asked to look at images of the collections from the various designers at the Vogue event and choose an outfit that inspired him to create a culinary counterpart. He chose two different looks by Dent de Man, a design house based in East London but drawing inspiration within Ivory Coast. I was excited about this pairing because I've become a huge fan of Dent de Man and their wax print suits after seeing them up-close at Pitti Uomo in June, plus I knew the Java connection probably meant my culinary journey would be Eastern-inspired.  A look from Dent de Man's Spring/Summer 2015 suiting collectionChef Steve, born in Belgium, has been in the restaurant business since he was a child. His parents owned a restaurant for 36 years, which is where he first acquired his cooking chops and when he was 16, he decided to go to hospitality school. He described his time there, working with big chefs as, ""the first touch I had with cooking, inspiration, lifestyle and fashion. All those high level chefs, they are now very popular, very famous and on TV."" Once he finished with school, he started working in a ""three-Michelin star restaurant in Brussels,"" he continued, ""we were more than 20 people in the kitchen, I had to start from the bottom, cleaning vegetables... I suffered, starting from zero,"" after having already learned how to cook in his parents' restaurant. But it was great schooling for chef Steve, who can list many more Michelin-star restaurants, in locations that range from France, to Spain, to London on his résumé.  From the runway Spring/Summer 2015 Dent de Man collectionWhen asked what brought him to Dubai, to what he calls the ""challenge"" of being executive chef for a hotel, chef Steve was quick to reply, ""for about six or seven months before I got the call, I was thinking of coming to Dubai. Everybody is talking about Dubai, and all the great chefs, they are here."" He then offered an insight as to why the restaurant scene is so healthy and vibrant in the city, by explaining that ""there is a culture of going to restaurants here; in Europe we still have that culture of eating at home but here they don't have that. So restaurants are busy every day.""  Chef Steve Deconinck's scallop ceviche dishInspired by the fashions of Dent de Man, Chef Steve created two extraordinary dishes. One a fragrant scallop ceviche marinated in lime juice and brown sugar, accompanied by a basil and lime sorbet, smoked briefly in hay and served chilled in its shell. Chef Steve Deconinck's tuna and foie gras dishThe second dish a combination of tuna tartare and slightly seared tuna, paired with a royale de foie gras and baked foie gras, drizzled with a beetroot syrup, and finished with a sprinkling of edible flowers and beetroot crisps. I loved that chef Steve uses some oversized multicolored tweezers to put the final touches on his dishes! Both creations would belong in The Palace Downtown's Thai restaurant, Thiptara, which boasts one of the best views onto the Dubai Fountain, is soon launching an alternative Saturday brunch called the ""Hypnothai Brunch"" and matched the Dent de Man looks both in cultural inspiration and in color. Simply amazing.  Thiptara's Royal Thai terrace, with views of Dubai FountainBut while the eyes may want their share of a great dish, the final proof is definitely on the palate. I will start by saying that I found both creations by Chef Steve simply phenomenal. My taste buds were tickled even before I took the first bite of the scallop ceviche, which enveloped the spoon in its smokey scent and then surprised my tongue with the chilled tartness of the herby-lime sorbet. I finished the entire dish, trying elegantly to sop up every last drop of its sweet, fragrant juice with my spoon. And I don't usually even like scallops, cooked or otherwise, so immagine that! As far as the tuna and foie gras done two ways combination, I enjoyed the different textures dancing on my tongue and found the deconstruction of the ingredients, which all managed to come together into a symphony of flavors, simply divine. And for a bit of authentic chef Steve spirit and humor, I'll leave you with a YouTube video where he's asked to describe himself in three words -- usually a favorite last question of mine to really get to the soul of a person. In this case, a deliciously talented, work-around-the-clock, super creative human being. Stay tuned for more Dubai fashion, food and fun pairings in the days to come.

But one of the crucial blocks to achieving a degree is the costly price. The Minerva Project was started in 2012 to provide an elite Ivy League education for a fraction of the price. I talked to Ben Nelson, the Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Minerva about his innovative company. In addition to having a distinguished faculty and novel use of technology (classes are offered through webinars), the school takes a daring approach to pedagogy that emphasizes building leadership through the development of vital skill sets. In this interview, Nelson, who has a very impressive track record of tech business projects prior to this endeavor, speaks with me about the virtues of the Minerva system and how its experiential immersion compares to more traditional education. He also talks about where he thinks the future of web education is heading. Whatever one thinks about online education, there is no question that Minerva is pioneering and rethinking the wheel of academics in ways that could boldly impact the affordability, accessibility, and quality of US higher education. ""Once the first universities adopt our methodologies, which we do think will happen before our first class graduates in 2019, you will observe a sea change in higher education as other institutions move to incorporate a clearly superior academic model."" -- Ben NelsonWhat are the greatest advantages and disadvantages to your approach when compared to traditional models? Will the development of certain key skills and qualities suffer because of the lack of traditional campus activities, such as the arts, athletics and face-to-face academics? Minerva is designed from the ground up for a particular type of student. It starts with the curriculum and pedagogy, continues with the global immersion, and is reinforced by our selection process and the diversity of the student body. And it extends with the kind of lifetime support we provide for all Minervans.Quite possibly Minerva's greatest advantage is its curriculum and pedagogy. Professors are focused on critical thinking and mastery, and not memorization. Minerva has 115 ""habits of mind and foundational concepts"" that are introduced during the first year, when all students take four, yearlong cornerstone seminars: Formal Analyses (which focuses on core aspects of thinking critically), Empirical Analyses (which focuses on core aspects of thinking creatively), Multimodal Communication (which focuses on core aspects of communicating effectively) and Complex Systems (which focuses on core aspects of interacting effectively). This material is then used (and assessed) during the subsequent three years while students major in specific subjects.All of Minerva's classes are live seminars with less than 20 students to a professor. All classes are conducted using our live video conferencing platform that enables us to easily incorporate the latest science of learning techniques - small group learning, instant feedback, polling, etc.Another advantage is the global immersion each student will experience. Over the course of a student's 4-year academic career at Minerva they will live and learn in seven major cities around the world. This experience will be enhanced with rigorous academic studies using a ""city as your campus"" approach. They can participate in local sports, experience a vast array of arts and local culture, and interact with the bustling community around them. More than 75% of students in Minerva's inaugural class of 2019 are from outside the U.S. With such a diverse class composition, global immersion is naturally built into the dynamics of student life.Minerva will offer lifetime coaching and career support for its students and graduates by acting as their personal talent agency. We will provide placement, advisory, networking and publicity services after graduation, and access to a global network of innovators, entrepreneurs, accomplished academics, and social, political and business leaders. As for the lack of an official campus, Minerva students see it as an advantage because they get to use the world's great cities as their campus. Clearly, Minerva is not for everyone. Some students want the traditional campus life -- organized sports, a Greek system, etc. We feel that learning experience, skill building and personal growth are broadened, not minimized, by having these cities as their campuses. ""We know that the Minerva experience, without a traditional campus life, is not for everyone. Minerva is not trying to get rid of campuses; we are trying to start a movement of acceptance and practice of proven learning methodologies to produce great thinkers and doers."" -- Ben NelsonHow can you ensure that employers and graduate institutions take a degree from Minerva as seriously as they do any other degree? If employers and graduate institutions look at Minerva as simply equivalent to a Harvard or Stanford degree then we have failed. Our students are very well educated, have received a greater experiential platform, and have learned to work in an environment surrounded by people from all over the world. This is what employers are already coming to Minerva to find, as shown by the types of employment opportunities our students have at this stage (after only one year). Members of our Founding Class have secured internships and positions at Ashoka, Learn Capital, Santa Fe Institute, Uber, and other great institutions - equivalent to some of the best opportunities presented to rising seniors or graduates of the Ivy League. How long do you estimate it will be before programs like Minerva become a more mainstream option? Our goal is to be a catalyst for global change in higher education. We don't think that change will be immediate. However, once the first universities adopt our methodologies, which we do think will happen before our first class graduates in 2019, you will observe a sea change in higher education as other institutions move to incorporate a clearly superior academic model.I think back to the days before Amazon when people thought Amazon was crass and the only way to buy a book was from a bookstore. Then book stores disappeared and continue to. Do you believe that traditional education institutions will be replaced by virtual models? No, and that is not our intention. We know that the Minerva experience, without a traditional campus life, is not for everyone. Minerva is not trying to get rid of campuses; we are trying to start a movement of acceptance and practice of proven learning methodologies to produce great thinkers and doers. You can do that within the walls of a formal campus as well, but it will take a fundamental systemic shift to uproot some very old teaching traditions and the lack of real curricula. ""In today's world, the dissemination of knowledge can effectively be attained for free via books, MOOCs, adaptive learning software, etc. Traditional universities still largely look at the dissemination of knowledge as their primary responsibility.""  -- Ben NelsonYou emphasize critical thinking, creative thinking, and effective communication over traditional disciplines, core canons, and job training. When isolated from practical and traditional curricula, don't they risk becoming abstract?Education can be broken down into three categories: the dissemination of knowledge, intellectual development, and experiential learning. In today's world, the dissemination of knowledge can effectively be attained for free via books, MOOCs, adaptive learning software, etc. Traditional universities still largely look at the dissemination of knowledge as their primary responsibility. Intellectual development is where the role of curriculum comes in. Historically, there have been two paths for universities to provide intellectual development. The first were the rigid curricula found in the 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States and still found in single subject studies in other countries. With the explosion of information in the 20th century, these curricula became impractical and have almost completely gone extinct. Another method can be found to this day at Oxford and Cambridge through the tutorial model. In theory, the student takes a set of classes as to their choosing and then meet with their tutor on a 1:1 or 2:1 basis who connects the threads for the student and guides their overall intellectual development. This model works in an environment where the set of classes that students choose comes from one or a small set of fields. Even in this model the quality of intellectual development is highly dependent on the skills of the tutor and therefore presents large variability and risk not to mention high cost.Experiential learning is just that, experiential. For apprenticed fields (e.g. a blacksmith, a dentist, a concert pianist, etc.) students require a substantial amount of hands on practical training. In fields that are traditionally considered white collar, experiences need to be gained by integrating with the real world - having internships, field work, research experiences, and others. Minerva students have both substantial time set aside (4 months of every year), resources (the Minerva Agency), and exposure (Minerva co-curriculars) to ensure ample experiential training.What is the ideal post-graduate job for a student at Minerva? Minerva is preparing students to be global citizens and leaders, and their knowledge, skills and potential will know no boundaries. In general, Minerva students are prepared for the ""creative classes"" (law, politics, business, entrepreneurship, science, journalism, etc.). Minerva training is not particularly advantageous (though no less worthwhile than a traditional education) for ""practice classes"" (dentists, veterinarians, tax accountants, book-keepers, etc.).

The greater the challenge, the more this glass-half-full wisdom can come across as Pollyannaish and unrealistic. It's hard to find the motivation to focus on the positive when positivity seems like nothing more than wishful thinking.The real obstacle to positivity is that our brains are hard-wired to look for and focus on threats. This survival mechanism served humankind well back when we were hunters and gatherers, living each day with the very real threat of being killed by someone or something in our immediate surroundings.That was eons ago. Today, this mechanism breeds pessimism and negativity through the mind's tendency to wander until it finds a threat. These ""threats"" magnify the perceived likelihood that things are going--and/or are going to go--poorly. When the threat is real and lurking in the bushes down the path, this mechanism serves you well. When the threat is imagined and you spend two months convinced the project you're working on is going to flop, this mechanism leaves you with a soured view of reality that wreaks havoc in your life.  Positivity and Your HealthPessimism is trouble because it's bad for your health. Numerous studies have shown that optimists are physically and psychologically healthier than pessimists.Martin Seligman at the University of Pennsylvania has conducted extensive research on the topic. Seligman finds much higher rates of depression in people who pessimistically attribute their failures to personal deficits. Optimists, however, treat failure as a learning experience and believe they can do better in the future.To examine physical health, Seligman worked with researchers from Dartmouth and the University of Michigan on a study that followed people from age 25 to 65 to see how their levels of pessimism or optimism influenced or correlated with their overall health. The researchers found that pessimists' health deteriorated far more rapidly as they aged.Seligman's findings are similar to research conducted by the Mayo Clinic that found optimists have lower levels of cardiovascular disease and longer life-spans. Although the exact mechanism through which pessimism affects health hasn't been identified, researchers at Yale and the University of Colorado found that pessimism is associated with a weakened immune response to tumors and infection.Researchers from the Universities of Kentucky and Louisville went so far as to inject optimists and pessimists with a virus to measure their immune response. The researchers found optimists had a significantly stronger immune response than pessimists.Positivity and PerformanceKeeping a positive attitude isn't just good for your health. Martin Seligman has also studied the connection between positivity and performance. In one study in particular, he measured the degree to which insurance salespeople were optimistic or pessimistic in their work, including whether they attributed failed sales to personal deficits beyond their control or circumstances they could improve with effort. Optimistic salespeople sold 37% more policies than pessimists, who were twice as likely to leave the company during their first year of employment.Seligman has studied positivity more than anyone, and he believes in the ability to turn pessimistic thoughts and tendencies around with simple effort and know-how. But Seligman doesn't just believe this. His research shows that people can transform a tendency toward pessimistic thinking into positive thinking through simple techniques that create lasting changes in behavior long after they are discovered.Your brain just needs a little help to defeat its negative inner voice. Here are two simple steps you can take that will train your brain to focus on the positive.Step 1. Separate Fact from FictionThe first step in learning to focus on the positive requires knowing how to stop negative self-talk in its tracks. The more you ruminate on negative thoughts, the more power you give them. Most of our negative thoughts are just that--thoughts, not facts.When you find yourself believing the negative and pessimistic things your inner voice says, it's time to stop and write them down. Literally stop what you're doing and write down what you're thinking. Once you've taken a moment to slow down the negative momentum of your thoughts, you will be more rational and clear-headed in evaluating their veracity. Evaluate these statements to see if they're factual. You can bet the statements aren't true any time you see words like never, always, worst, ever, etc.Do you really always lose your keys? Of course not. Perhaps you forget them frequently, but most days you do remember them. Are you never going to find a solution to your problem? If you really are that stuck, maybe you've been resisting asking for help. Or if it really is an intractable problem, then why are you wasting your time beating your head against the wall? If your statements still look like facts once they're on paper, take them to a friend or colleague you can trust, and see if he or she agrees with you. Then the truth will surely come out.When it feels like something always or never happens, this is just your brain's natural threat tendency inflating the perceived frequency or severity of an event. Identifying and labeling your thoughts as thoughts by separating them from the facts will help you escape the cycle of negativity and move toward a positive new outlook.Step 2. Identify a PositiveNow that you have a tool to snap yourself out of self-defeating, negative thoughts, it's time to help your brain learn what you want it to focus on--the positive.This will come naturally after some practice, but first you have to give your wandering brain a little help by consciously selecting something positive to think about. Any positive thought will do to refocus your brain's attention. When things are going well, and your mood is good, this is relatively easy. When things are going poorly, and your mind is flooded with negative thoughts, this can be a challenge. In these moments, think about your day and identify one positive thing that happened, no matter how small. If you can't think of something from the current day, reflect on the previous day or even the previous week. Or perhaps there is an exciting event you are looking forward to that you can focus your attention on.The point here is you must have something positive that you're ready to shift your attention to when your thoughts turn negative. In step one, you learned how to strip the power from negative thoughts by separating fact from fiction. Step two is to replace the negative with a positive. Once you have identified a positive thought, draw your attention to that thought each time you find yourself dwelling on the negative. If that proves difficult, you can repeat the process of writing down the negative thoughts to discredit their validity, and then allow yourself to freely enjoy positive thoughts.Bringing It All TogetherI realize these two steps sound incredibly basic, but they have tremendous power because they retrain your brain to have a positive focus. These steps break old habits, if you force yourself to use them. Given the mind's natural tendency to wander toward negative thoughts, we can all use a little help with staying positive. Put these steps to use, and you'll reap the physical, mental, and performance benefits that come with a positive frame of mind.  How do you stay positive? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below, as I learn just as much from you as you do from me."

And more than a few people have noted that every refugee seems to be carrying a smart phone. This may come as a surprise to westerners, who might think that refugees should be out of the tech loop, but in fact, as the World Bank reports, there are 85 smart phones (and I don't mean Nokias with Snake) for every 100 people in Syria. 110 per 100 for Egypt and 125 per 100 for the UK.Smart phones are ubiquitous. It is possible to buy a second hand smart phone (iPhone 4) for less than $40. Now, what makes this particularly interesting is that each of those smart phones has the capacity to shoot (and even edit) video, as well as broadcast (share) it with the rest of the world for free.With three million Syrian refugees in the world that means that there are now approximately 2.5 million smart phones in Syrian hands, recording all the hardships and trauma that they are encountering every day. I mean, I think it is a pretty fair guess that if you have a phone with you and if you are undergoing what is probably the most traumatic experience of your life, then it is also a fair guess that you are recording it as video. So where is all that video? 2.5 million cameras shooting 24 hours a day -- video that is unquestionably honest, first person, as it happens, on the spot, from the source storytelling. Of all those millions of hours of video, how much of it have you seen on TV news?Would ""none"" be a good estimate?Actually, my friend Ian Wagdin at The BBC led me to one link that made reference to some video that refugees trapped in a camp in Cyrpus shot. Here is how The BBC reported it:The footage appears to have been filmed on a smartphone by one of the migrants at the camp, which has been set up at another military station in the east of the island.This is one video from one incident on one day. Where is all the rest? The truth is that the networks, none of them, will show these videos, or even countenance showing them. And why? Probably because they feel you can't trust them as true.What do they trust? They trust it when they send their own people to report on what is happening. Now, these reporters generally don't speak the language, know the culture, know the stories. They are the consummate outsiders, thrusting a microphone into someone's face for a quick soundbite. They report from a distance. And who knows if what they report is actually true. They are limited by what they know or don't know -- with an emphasis on the latter.But actual footage from actual refugees who want to tell their own stories to the world? Apparently not. Now, maybe there are more examples than the one above. Probably there are, but this is still pathetic. It's a remnant of a 19th century almost colonialist mentality. WE come to you to report the truth to the world. WE know better. This was great in 100 years ago when, in the words of HL Mencken, The Freedom of the Press is limited to those who own a press. But today, with smart phones and the Internet, everyone - every Syrian refugee, every Palestinian, every Iraqi, and so on OWNS a press. Where are their stories? Where are their voices?There's an inherent irony here. Journalists love to extoll a FREE PRESS, until, that is, they are actually confronted with one."

I think there are plenty of reasons to oppose national standards no matter what standards they are, and plenty of reasons to believe that no set of national standards will ever accomplish any of the goals set for them.But let's set all of that aside for a moment and talk about how the very attempt to assess standards-based outcomes ruins those standards.For my example, I'm going to pick the oft-noted CCSS standards about evidence.I pick it because it's a part of the Common Core that doesn't particularly bother me. Like most English teachers, I've been encouraging (in many cases, quite vigorously) my students to provide support for whatever idea they are trying to assert. (""No, Chris -- saying Huck Finn is a dynamic character because he does dynamic stuff in a dynamic way does not really make your case."") When I assign a paper, two of the main questions I consider when assigning a grade are: 1) Did you actually have a point? and 2) Did you support it with actual evidence?So in this area, the Core and I can co-exist peacefully.But this kind of evidence use is a tool, a technique, and so it can't be assessed in a vacuum, just as you cannot judge somebody's hammering skills by just watching them hold a hammer or judge their free-throw shooting skills without handing them a ball. And that's where we get into trouble.Assessing this skill is easiest when tying it to an act of critical thinking. But critical thinking has to be an open-ended activity. (Here's a quick tip -- if your question only has a single possible correct answer, it is not assessing critical thinking skills.) In my classroom, the most obvious avenue is a response to literature, though it will also work to deal with social issues, human behavior puzzles, historical research, or evaluating somebody else's essay work. Just to name a few.To make this assessment work, I have to really know my stuff. I have to know Huck Finn frontwards and backwards, and perhaps augment my own expertise with lots of reading of scholarly critiques of the work. I have to know the work well enough that I can give the student freedom to go where his ideas lead him without me having to say, ""Sorry, but I don't know anything about that, so I can't grade it, so you can't do it.""Every area of study is like a big patch of real estate, and I need to be a well-informed native guide who knows the territory so well that no matter where the student wanders off to, I'll know the terrain. When I don't know the territory, I end up fencing students in. ""Just stay on the path -- don't stray."" At the very worst, I will lay rails and make everyone ride through the territory on a train that only goes where it is meant to. The train tour is by far the least interesting, the least useful, the least rewarding, the least educational, and the least authentic way to explore the territory. It rules out all discovery and invention, and it is certainly hard on any prospect for joy or excitement.But again -- we can only scrap the train and the pathway if we have a knowledgeable native guide. That's how my juniors can do a unit built on research of local history -- because I've made myself a little bit of an expert on the subject. That's how my colleague can do a massive end-of-year project with her AP seniors about ""Paradise Lost"" -- because she knows and loves that work. If we had to trade projects, we would both be lost.But within our areas, we are qualified to tell the difference between evidence that is really evidence, and evidence that is just a piece of camouflaged baloney.So here's why a standardized test can't test this standard.First, a standardized tests starts with the assumption that any person (or computer program) should be able to evaluate the student's work without possessing any actual expertise at all.Second, the answers have to be evaluate-able in a very short time span.And that means we will travel through the territory strapped into a seat on a tightly run train.Look through the PARCC samples. These are slightly spiffed up multiple-choice single answer questions. The new SAT essay is just a wordier version of the same thing-- look at a piece of writing, determine what point the test manufacturers think you should see, and support it with the evidence that the test manufacturers believe are the correct pieces of evidence. These folks keep coming up with more complicated ways to ask closed-ended questions. This is partly, I suspect, because it's simply faster and more efficient to have a test of closed-ended questions that can be scored by any non-expert (or non-human). But also partly because some of these folks just have a narrow, cramped, stilted view of life and the world. ""I handed you a brush, a small flat surface, and a jar of blue paint. What else would any normal person do except paint the flat surface solid blue?""But that's not critical thinking, and it's not supporting your ideas with evidence.Now, what is often shortened to ""support with evidence"" in discussion of the CCSS is actually mangled pretty badly in the actual wording of the standards, but even if it weren't, the Big Standardized Tests would mangle this idea to death anyway.What this should properly mean is, ""Come up with an idea that makes sense to you, and support it with evidence that you believe backs up your idea."" But the only person who can evaluate that is a classroom teacher who possesses: 1) Enough expertise to evaluate the student's process, 2) Fewer than 1,000 students so that said evaluation can occur within the next week or so.So what the standard means in a standardized test situations is, ""Figure out what idea the test manufacturer wants you to find, and then locate the details that the test manufacturer wants you to pick out.""When we talk about test prep in the ELA world, we're talking about getting students into that second mindset, about training them to figure out the One Correct Answer associated with each piece of reading and the Only Correct Evidence located as well. And then repeat it, year after year after year.And what really sucks is that we are getting good at it, and our students are paying the price. This whole blog piece is the result of a conversation I had with a colleague, both of us concerned because, despite our best efforts, we find our students over the past few years have become progressively worse at really engaging with reading and writing. They have learned that it's not about thinking or reacting or engaging and gripping the material with your own brain. What do you think? Why do you think that? Can you convince me to agree with you? I feel like my students have only recently encountered these kinds of questions, and they aren't sure what to do with them, because they've learned that there's only one right way to do each reading and writing task, and that one right way is known by someone else, and it's up to them to figure that out.Of course, this issue didn't start with Common Core and Big Standardized Testing, but those conjoined twins have made things so much worse. When you try to make a complicated idea something you can assess ""at scale,"" you do enormous damage. When you write a standard specifically so that you CAN test it ""at scale,"" you break it entirely. Originally posted at Curmudgucation"

""Well, if you don’t think Jeb can fix things, remember the election in Florida in 2000? He can fix things.""Maher was referring to that year's presidential election, which George W. Bush won thanks to a razor-thin margin of victory in Florida over then-Vice President Al Gore. The win came after a controversial vote recount that lasted weeks.Many Democrats maintain that the outcome in the state was the result of foul play by Florida’s government, which was at the time under the leadership of Jeb, George W. Bush’s brother.The governor, among other things, purged 58,000 people from the voting rolls -- a disproportionate number of whom were African-American -- to purportedly root out ex-felons. Florida was one of eight states that barred ex-felons from voting at the time. But as Ari Berman reported in The Nation, the list of purged voters was riddled with errors, which led to the wrongful disenfranchisement of 12,000 Floridians. The ""Jeb Can Fix It"" slogan is part of a Bush campaign reboot, and has been the subject of widespread mockery since its introduction last week. A search for #JebCanFixIt on Twitter turns up mostly taunting quips from Bush's critics.  Even the conservative National Review got in on the act. The Bush campaign neglected to register the domain name jebcanfixit.com. Instead, Jimmy Flannigan, who ran for Austin, Texas, city council in 2014 using the slogan ""Flannigan Can Fix It,"" bought it to poke fun at Bush.In his monologue, Maher also used news about positive job growth in October to whack the candidate.""Now, this doesn’t mean everyone is working,"" he said.

14,POLITICS,GOP Voters Want An Outsider. Can Marco Rubio Convince Them He Is One?,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-outsider-candidates_us_563d2065e4b0b24aee4a6c0d,An influx of endorsements for the senator could make it harder for him to distance himself from the party establishment that primary voters loathe.,2015-11-07,"Republican presidential candidate Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) files paperwork for the New Hampshire primary at the State House on Nov. 5, 2015, in Concord, New Hampshire. A HuffPost/YouGov poll finds that he's largely considered an establishment candidate.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/563d22b01400002b003ca2c9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) is having a moment in the Republican establishment. Since the Oct. 28 Republican debate, he's racked up five congressional endorsements, including his first three from other senators.That represents substantial movement in the so-called ""invisible primary"" among GOP leaders, who've been slower than usual to weigh in on the race so far. Endorsements from party elites, including governors and members of Congress, have often correlated with a candidate's success with voters.But the endorsements also tie Rubio more closely to a Republican establishment most voters want little to do with. While GOP voters like their current presidential field, they're both deeply unhappy with their current elected officials and mistrustful of the party's ability to choose the best candidates for office.In a new HuffPost/YouGov survey, Republican and Republican-leaning voters say by a 45-point margin that they prefer an outsider candidate to one who's favored by the party establishment.""I really want less of a politician. I want a normal person,"" one Manchester, New Hampshire, woman explained Tuesday during a focus group of Republican ""Walmart Moms"" (defined by the pollsters as ""voters with children age 18 or younger at home and who shopped at Walmart at least once in the past month"").""I know some people are concerned they need government experience -- I really think that there's enough politicians there to back them up,"" she added to laughter from the group.GOP voters' view of whether their top-polling candidates are outsiders or establishment figures is guided, but not entirely delineated, by whether or not they've held office.Current frontrunners Donald Trump and Ben Carson are almost universally seen as outsiders in the HuffPost/YouGov poll. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who's often clashed with his party's leadership, is perceived by a narrower margin as an outsider.Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, whose numbers have recently flagged, is regarded as an establishment favorite. So, to a lesser extent, is Rubio -- a notion he took an apparent stab at dispelling during the latest debate, using a question on his relative youth to suggest that he'd faced similar opposition within his party.""That's exactly what the Republican establishment said, too, 'Why don't you wait in line?'"" he told CNBC's Carl Quintanilla.Perhaps more effectively, he also leveraged a question about his recent financial problems to stress his modest background as the student loan-burdened son of a bartender and maid.That detail resonated with the New Hampshire focus group. Asked to name the race's outsider candidates, they jumped unprompted to Rubio, even before ticking off more obvious names like Trump, Carson or Carly Fiorina.Despite his current office, one woman reasoned, Rubio wasn't born into a political legacy or family wealth -- something that resonated with her own economic struggles.""He just didn't have a lot of money,"" she said.There's evidence that Rubio's modest background and his financial mishaps are more of a positive than a negative. In a June HuffPost/YouGov poll, Republican voters said by a net 8-point margin that a candidate's personal experience with debt was an asset, not a liability.Rubio ""has a good financial story to tell -- or at least one that is relatable to a lot of Americans,"" his spokesman, Alex Conant, argued at the time.There's also the possibility that the clamoring for an anti-establishment nominee could fade, even if Republicans' deep-seated anger toward the political system remains.Voters' stated preference for a certain type of candidate often turns out to be mainly a reflection of the person they're already supporting. Democrats, for instance, held an aversion toward older candidates while Ronald Reagan and John McCain was running, an opinion which seems to have since disappeared. And while the GOP has been unhappy with Washington for a while, Republicans as recently as March vastly preferred ""experience and a proven record"" over ""new ideas and a different approach"" -- until Donald Trump came along, making it hard to tell whether his popularity explains that viewpoint or vice-versa.In the former case, if an establishment-friendly political candidate picks up steam, Republicans' overwhelming preference for an outsider might not prove so defining next year. If it's the latter, though, politicians like Rubio will have to figure out the best way of selling themselves to voters as an antidote to the political system they currently work in.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted Nov. 2-4 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.

Marijuana is currently classified as a Schedule I drug, the most dangerous of five substance categories listed in the Controlled Substances Act. According to the federal classification, Schedule I drugs have ""no currently accepted medical use."" Other Schedule I substances include heroin, ecstasy and LSD. Under Clinton's proposal, marijuana would become a Schedule II substance, which are considered to have ""less abuse potential."" Cocaine, OxyContin, Adderall and meth are Schedule II drugs. The move, Clinton said Saturday, would allow federal researchers to explore how to best use marijuana as medicine.""What I do want is for us to support research into medical marijuana because a lot more states have passed medical marijuana than have legalized marijuana, so we've got two different experiences or even experiments going on right now,"" Clinton said after being asked about marijuana prohibition during a town hall. ""And the problem with medical marijuana is there's a lot of anecdotal evidence about how well it works for certain conditions, but we haven't done any research. Why? Because it's considered what's called a Schedule I drug and you can't even do research in it."" ""If we're going to have a lot of states setting up marijuana dispensaries so that people who have some kind of medical need are getting marijuana, we need know what's the quality of it, how much should you take, what should you avoid if you're taking other medications,"" she continued. Clinton has said previously that she does not support legalizing marijuana, but believes in the medical use of cannabis and reforming the criminal justice system to keep low-level drug offenders out of jail. ""We have got to stop imprisoning people who use marijuana,"" she said last month during the Democratic primary debate.Clinton's proposal is similar to policies floated by some medical marijuana advocates. Earlier this year, the American Academy of Pediatrics called on the Drug Enforcement Administration to reclassify cannabis in order to promote medical research. And in July, members of the U.S. House introduced an amendment to the 21st Century Cures Act that would make it easier to conduct marijuana research. ""The rescheduling of marijuana is a step in the right direction, but only going down to Schedule II is mostly a symbolic move,"" said Tom Angell, the chairman of Marijuana Majority. ""It may make research slightly easier, but on its own wouldn't do anything to protect seriously ill people who are using marijuana in accordance with state laws from being harassed by the DEA. Only changing the federal criminal statutes can effectively do that.""Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Clinton's main rival in the Democratic presidential primary, has called for striking marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act all together. Earlier this week, he introduced the Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act in the Senate, which would allow states to move forward with legalizing marijuana without federal intervention.""Too many Americans have seen their lives destroyed because they have criminal records as a result of marijuana use,"" Sanders said at George Mason University in October. ""That’s wrong. That has got to change.""Former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, who is also running for the Democratic nomination, has proposed rescheduling marijuana as well.Recreational marijuana use is now legal in four states and the District of Columbia, while 23 states and D.C. have legalized medical pot.This article has been updated to include a statement from the Marijuana Majority.

The responding officers were ""very rude and unprofessional,"" Overbey, now 28, told The Huffington Post. She said one officer indicated she should expect to be robbed, given the location of her apartment. Overbey called the police department again to file a complaint about the officers, and two others arrived to take her report. A crime technician came to dust for prints after the police left. By then, a group of people had gathered in the apartment to comfort Overbey, who was still vocally upset about the burglary and how she had been treated. The technician requested police assistance ""because he was alone in the apartment and was concerned about the commotion outside the bedroom door,"" according to a memorandum filed by Baltimore city lawyers.Officer Fred E. Hannah responded to the technician’s call. Overbey said she remembers hearing a loud bang at the door before Hannah opened it. The officer’s badge was not visible and he didn’t announce himself. According to Overbey, he walked through the apartment without addressing her attempts to ask who he was. When Hannah finally identified himself, Overbey said she told him, ""That gun you’re holding and badge don’t give you the right to disrespect my home or myself.""It was then that Overbey says she was told she was under arrest. ""I put my arms behind my back and he walked me over to the wall closest to the exit. As he’s attempting -- or what I thought was an attempt -- to put the handcuffs on, I turned my head and I asked him what was I under arrest for,"" Overbey said. ""And then he grabbed me by my hair and threw me out into the hallway and up against the wall across the hall. And that’s when he just started beating me.""Hannah called for backup, and Officers Martin Richardson and Grant Galing responded, according to a lawsuit Overbey filed against the city. Richardson threw Overbey on the ground and began ""violently and maliciously striking"" her, the suit alleges, and Galing shocked her twice with a Taser.Last September, the city paid Overbey $63,000 to settle her complaint. But there was one big condition: If she wanted to keep the money, Overbey couldn't talk about how the cops had treated her. This condition, called a nondisparagement clause, is included in around 95 percent of Baltimore city’s police-misconduct settlements. ""The city does it to keep people who have beaten up by the police silent,"" said Ben Jealous, former president of the NAACP.Baltimore’s nondisparagement clause is similar to those employed by other major cities like Atlanta, Boston, Minneapolis and Colorado Springs, Colorado. But officials in Minneapolis told HuffPost that they rarely use the clauses, if ever. ""The City of Minneapolis does not generally use non-disparagement clauses in case settlements,"" city spokesman Casper Hill wrote in an email. ""As a public entity, we believe maintaining a certain amount of openness and transparency helps build public trust in the city.""These clauses are common in settlement agreements, and usually prevent recipients from slandering the other parties involved, discussing the amount awarded and the terms of the settlement. But most legal understanding of cases involving nondisparagement clauses are between two private parties, not a citizen and a city. ""Generally, the commonplace area you see nondisparagement agreements is in the general contracts between consumers and sellers,"" said Michael Smith, a civil litigation lawyer in Los Angeles. “But they have been done in settlement agreements like this before and they have been done in Maryland before. And … the law between private parties in Maryland says that’s perfectly fine from a contract perspective.” Baltimore's nondisparagement clauses are designed to prevent victims from sharing the alleged details of a case or the names of the officers involved. Maryland doesn't legally require that this type of clause be used in police misconduct settlements -- they are simply a provision added by the city, according to the ACLU of Maryland. ""It creates an environment where it’s easier for there to be more of these cases,"" Jealous said. ""It protects officers who are prone to violence and ends up costing the city more money at the very least -- not to mention a trail of victims across the city.""Baltimore paid out around $12 million in police misconduct cases between 2010 and 2014, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis published in July. The city’s most expensive payouts resulted from civil-rights violations and other forms of misconduct such as alleged shootings, beatings and wrongful imprisonment. The city’s solicitor has discretion not to include these clauses in settlements and makes the decision to do so on a case-by-case basis, said Howard Libit, Baltimore’s director of strategic planning and policy. One example is the $6.4 million settlement awarded to Freddie Gray’s family, which did not include a nondisparagement clause because media coverage had already made the facts of the case widely known.Baltimore's nondisparagement clauses are quite vague, said Alexander Bush, a litigation attorney in Baltimore. They don't say whether plaintiffs can discuss the officers' involvement in other incidents of misconduct or if they are barred from speaking ill of the Baltimore Police Department in general. The city's lawyers once said the clauses are ""not an act of secrecy or concealment but of resolution, satisfaction and peacemaking,"" according to a Baltimore Sun editorial from May. The lawyers believe media coverage could blow the claims out of proportion and be ""even more exaggerated than [those] in [the plaintiffs'] original complaint."" City officials also see the clauses as good business decisions that save taxpayers money since it costs more to litigate each complaint. The city could sue plaintiffs for defamation if they make demonstratively false claims outside of court, Bush said. ""If nondisparagement clauses are to get people to stop spreading lies and shaming police officers, then why did you settle it in the first place?"" Bush said. ""If it’s so obvious that their lawsuits have no substance … take it to trial and show the public that. The only reason you’d hide something is if you’re afraid of it ... as an attorney, you love taking those cases to court.""The main purpose of these clauses is to aid the city’s public image, he added. They give the city leeway to claim there’s no pattern of police misconduct -- a claim that the clauses prevent settlement recipients from disputing. They also make it difficult for attorneys to find prior victims to put their clients' incidents in context when filing civil suits against the police department. ""They’re settling cases that they don’t want people to hear about,"" Bush said. ""And it helps them that they tack on this clause so that the person who’s best able to really explain what happened now can’t talk to people about it.""Jealous maintains that the clauses are used ""to silence and bully victims of police brutality."" Darrien Hunt, 22, was shot and killed by Utah police last year. In September, his mother rejected a $900,000 settlement offer from the police department because accepting the funds would have barred her from publicly discussing what happened to her son. ""To me it was a gag order [that said], 'Here's hush money, don't ever say Darrien's name again,'"" Susan Hunt, Darrien’s mother, told Utah's KSL news.""My biggest concern is for the truth to be told,"" she added.Overbey, however, couldn’t afford to do this. She lost her apartment and couldn't find a job while her civil suit dragged on -- in part because Baltimore refused to drop seven criminal charges against her until she settled. She and her children were homeless for a significant portion of the time. She planned to use her settlement money to furnish a home, catch up on her bills and make a donation to a youth program in the city.""It had been two long years and I was really tired of dealing with this,"" she said. ""A lot of people give up altogether or don’t pursue it because they can’t afford to. I could not work for two years, which means I could not provide for myself or my children, but I felt so strongly with not letting them get away with it.""Overbey was glad the ordeal was over -- until she saw her name and picture in the newspaper. Despite the limits they place on victims' speech, nondisparagement clauses usually allow the city to disclose basic facts and circumstances surrounding the settlement. ""I found out that my name, my picture and my settlement amount had been released on the front page of the Baltimore Sun,"" Overbey recalled. ""This all started because someone had broken into my home. It’s like my life was just finally starting to come back together and then they do that. I’m terrified that someone is gonna come kick my door in for money I don’t even have.""The public exposure triggered online abuse from anonymous commenters who claimed Overbey concocted the incident in order to receive a payout. When Overbey defended herself against these accusations, city lawyers said her comments about what happened too closely reflected statements in the lawsuit and thus violated the settlement’s terms. This triggered the nondisparagement clause, and the city seized half of Overbey's settlement.""It devastated me, honestly,"" Overbey said. ""Me and my children suffered for two whole years. It wasn’t about the money but if they aren’t going to take their badges and get them off the streets then the least they’re gonna do is give me something -- some kind of compensation. And then for them to turn around and even take that, it drove me crazy.""Now, Overbey says she feels obligated to speak out about what happened to her. ""It’s not fair [that] they beat us -- they’re the real criminals but we’re the ones who suffer,"" she said. ""They can speak freely, put our names in the papers but the whole time the gag order protects these officers.""It doesn't have to be this way. Many cities, including Las Vegas, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C., often choose not to use nondisparagement clauses even though there is no explicit policy against them. ""Our view is that we generally don’t need such language,"" a spokesman from the Philadephia mayor's office said. "
17,POLITICS,Baltimore Buys Victims' Silence With Settlements For Police Misconduct,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/baltimore-police-misconduct-settlements_us_563bc4b2e4b0411d30703ca2,"Victims are compensated, as long as they promise to never speak publicly about what happened to them.",2015-11-07,Demonstrators protest in front of City Hall in Baltimore the day after six police officers were charged in the death of Freddie Gray.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/563bca28140000f1013ca0fd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- On April 30, 2012, Ashley Overbey called the police because someone had broken into her Northeast Baltimore apartment while she was at work. The responding officers were ""very rude and unprofessional,"" Overbey, now 28, told The Huffington Post. She said one officer indicated she should expect to be robbed, given the location of her apartment. Overbey called the police department again to file a complaint about the officers, and two others arrived to take her report. A crime technician came to dust for prints after the police left. By then, a group of people had gathered in the apartment to comfort Overbey, who was still vocally upset about the burglary and how she had been treated. The technician requested police assistance ""because he was alone in the apartment and was concerned about the commotion outside the bedroom door,"" according to a memorandum filed by Baltimore city lawyers.Officer Fred E. Hannah responded to the technician’s call. Overbey said she remembers hearing a loud bang at the door before Hannah opened it. The officer’s badge was not visible and he didn’t announce himself. According to Overbey, he walked through the apartment without addressing her attempts to ask who he was. When Hannah finally identified himself, Overbey said she told him, ""That gun you’re holding and badge don’t give you the right to disrespect my home or myself.""It was then that Overbey says she was told she was under arrest. ""I put my arms behind my back and he walked me over to the wall closest to the exit. As he’s attempting -- or what I thought was an attempt -- to put the handcuffs on, I turned my head and I asked him what was I under arrest for,"" Overbey said. ""And then he grabbed me by my hair and threw me out into the hallway and up against the wall across the hall. And that’s when he just started beating me.""Hannah called for backup, and Officers Martin Richardson and Grant Galing responded, according to a lawsuit Overbey filed against the city. Richardson threw Overbey on the ground and began ""violently and maliciously striking"" her, the suit alleges, and Galing shocked her twice with a Taser.Last September, the city paid Overbey $63,000 to settle her complaint. But there was one big condition: If she wanted to keep the money, Overbey couldn't talk about how the cops had treated her. This condition, called a nondisparagement clause, is included in around 95 percent of Baltimore city’s police-misconduct settlements.

Prosecutors allege that Kinsella had been bringing the boy to two hospitals, one in St. Louis and another 200 miles away in Kansas City, to get drugs used for seizures and mental health.""The child, when he would present at the hospital in very serious condition, would get much better while he was there,"" St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch told Fox 2. ""When he was returned to her custody he got sick again. And apparently was being treated by two different doctors, apparently unknown to each other.""Missouri is the only state in the nation without a prescription medication database, which would allow a hospital to see what another has prescribed a patient, although legislators are trying to change that.Authorities handed custody of the boy to his grandparents in January and launched an investigation into Kinsella.Kinsella told police that she ""accidentally"" gave her son the wrong medication on ""an occasion,"" the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reports. But medical experts believe the type and amount of drugs found in the boy's system proved that she was poisoning him on purpose.Investigators believe she was poisoning her son to get attention, the Post-Dispatch reports -- a condition called Munchausen syndrome by proxy.Kinsella's lawyer denies the charges.""We deny all the allegations that have been made against her,"" defense attorney Greg Smith told Fox 2. ""Rachel wants her son back and she has been dealing with that through a juvenile case. Now that we have the criminal case we are prepared to fight the good fight."" Kinsella was reportedly released from jail on $50,000 bond, according to the New York Daily News. She was slapped with a no-contact order on Friday and can't reach her son until further notice from the court."

Today, we speak with Aung Zaw, founder and editor-in-chief of The Irrawaddy. Myanmar will hold elections on Sunday to elect a new parliament, known as the Hluttaw. It'll be the first national election since the country embarked on a transition to democracy and freed Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi after years under house arrest.The two front-runners in the election are the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party and Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy. The parliament will vote for a new president next year. Suu Kyi is running for a seat in the Hluttaw, but is banned from running for the presidency under a provision in the country's constitution.Myanmar, also known as Burma, ended 50 years of military rule in 2011, and began a process of instituting political and economic reforms. The U.S. lifted sanctions and poured aid into the nation, which has the lowest life expectancy in southeast Asia.Despite the reforms, journalists and dissidents have been jailed ahead of the vote. Many members of the country's Rohingya Muslim minority, which has been the target of anti-Muslim violence and discrimination in recent years, have been barred from voting. Meanwhile, the military retains considerable power: One-quarter of the seats in parliament, as well as key ministerial posts, are reserved for military appointees. The WorldPost spoke with Aung Zaw, the founder and editor of Burmese news organization The Irrawaddy, about the upcoming elections. Zaw set up The Irrawady from exile in Thailand in 1993, having fled the country because of his involvement in student activism. Since the reforms began, The Irrawady has opened an office inside Myanmar, and Zaw has been allowed to return to the country. In 2014, the Committee To Protect Journalists awarded Zaw an International Press Freedom Award.What is the mood like in Myanmar now ahead of the election?People are very hopeful, hopeful for change. They've been living in a very repressive atmosphere and under a repressive regime for so long. There's a change in atmosphere now. People want to exercise their rights. They are enjoying their freedom. This is also the first time Aung San Suu Kyi, who people have known for so long, has been free to participate in a national election. What is the situation like for journalists and opposition activists in Myanmar right now? There have been pockets of crackdown on dissidents and activists who post on social media, and some arrests in the the last two or three weeks have been quite disturbing.But today is much freer than before. Now, they select targeted people to arrest and put in prison, sending a message to the public that this kind of message, cartoon or caricature is not allowed -- whereas in the past they targeted massive numbers of people and put them in prison right away, without trials or lawyers. Have you been surprised by the changes that have taken place in these last years?Yes! I myself was allowed to return to my country two years ago. The Irrawaddy now has more than 50 people operating inside the country. Right now all my staff are spreading across the country, reporting from different places. We've been given freedom to write freely, as long as it's based on the facts and done responsibly, and we can be quite critical of many issues, as well as the government. How popular are Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD in Myanmar?I'm a little bit surprised [by the extent of her popularity]. In the past few years, there has been a systematic propaganda campaign against her, and Irrawaddy has published critical articles about her leadership and her shortcomings, like her failure to speak up on some issues. We felt that her popularity was shrinking.But when I went [to see] her campaign around the countryside last month, I saw that the color red [the color of the NLD] is everywhere, the symbols of Aung San Suu Kyi, the pictures, the flags, the peacocks, everything. I was surprised, but I can also understand why people see her as a beacon of hope and believe she's the only one who can bring them more freedom -- economic freedom and freedom from this repressive government, who they see as an extension of the previous military dictators. If the NLD wins, how do you think the military will react?I simply don't know. If Aung San Suu Kyi wins the majority of seats in the parliament, and if the military won't accept it, there will be a big issue, and it will drag on and on, and new problems will come to our country. That's what I'm afraid of. The election on Nov. 8 is one of the biggest milestones we will pass. However, the post-election period will be much more important and it could be very challenging for all of us, the people of Burma. No one wants to see the repeat of the election of 1990, and the repeat of the vicious cycles and crackdowns. Whoever wins the majority in the election, they have to be pragmatic, because the military is the biggest institution in the country and you have to talk to them. They have economic power and political power. So if the leadership is wise on both sides there will be some sort of compromise. This is about more than the result of the election. The military is not going to go away overnight. People have to be prepared to play a long game in politics.What about the nationalist Buddhist movement, the Ma Ba Tha? Is there a risk of unrest?I myself worried a lot about this. But so far, no serious violence has taken place, so I think the election will be safe, unless there is huge state-sponsored violence, which then will be very obvious. I am more concerned about the post-election period.However, my analysis is that Ma Ba Tha is divided right now. Some of the monks in the group support NLD and Aung San Suu Kyi. They think the organization went too far when they started attacking the democratic opposition. And I believe the extremist elements are getting weaker and weaker. What political or social changes need to take place to address some of the major issues blighting Myanmar’s transition to democracy, including discrimination against Rohingya Muslims?This issue is very sad, and needs to be addressed. This violence was systematically organized by some elements within the establishment, ahead of the 2015 elections. It started exactly two months after Aung San Suu Kyi and her party won a landslide victory in a by-election in April 2012.There is a very diverse community in Burma, including Hindus, Christians, Jews, as well as Muslims and the Buddhist majority, and they all used to live quite peacefully. We can go back to that normal life one day, but only if the government starts to talk about how diversity is our strength and not our weakness. It's a beautiful country and a diverse society. But as long as the authorities want to manipulate this diversity to stoke fear and nationalism, then we will have a problem. That's why we need to have a more open-minded, responsive government, who will calm the situation.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.More from The WorldPost's Weekly Interview Series:Also on The WorldPost:"

Is there a risk of unrest?I myself worried a lot about this. But so far, no serious violence has taken place, so I think the election will be safe, unless there is huge state-sponsored violence, which then will be very obvious. I am more concerned about the post-election period.However, my analysis is that Ma Ba Tha is divided right now. Some of the monks in the group support NLD and Aung San Suu Kyi. They think the organization went too far when they started attacking the democratic opposition. And I believe the extremist elements are getting weaker and weaker. What political or social changes need to take place to address some of the major issues blighting Myanmar’s transition to democracy, including discrimination against Rohingya Muslims?This issue is very sad, and needs to be addressed. This violence was systematically organized by some elements within the establishment, ahead of the 2015 elections. It started exactly two months after Aung San Suu Kyi and her party won a landslide victory in a by-election in April 2012.There is a very diverse community in Burma, including Hindus, Christians, Jews, as well as Muslims and the Buddhist majority, and they all used to live quite peacefully. We can go back to that normal life one day, but only if the government starts to talk about how diversity is our strength and not our weakness. It's a beautiful country and a diverse society. But as long as the authorities want to manipulate this diversity to stoke fear and nationalism, then we will have a problem. That's why we need to have a more open-minded, responsive government, who will calm the situation.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.More from The WorldPost's Weekly Interview Series:Also on The WorldPost:"

23,POLITICS,Gay Couple Can't Get Married Because They're Legally Father And Son,Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/drew-bosee-nino-esposito-gay-marriage_us_563cce95e4b0b24aee49f8c6,"Like other gay couples before the days of same-sex marriage, one partner adopted the other so they could have some legal rights.",2015-11-07,Nino Esposito and Drew Bosee on the day Esposito adopted Bosee. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/563cd158140000f1013ca202.jpeg?cache=Q07HlHsH2y&ops=crop_0_80_480_280%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Drew Bosee, 68, and Nino Esposito, 78, didn't think they'd ever see same-sex marriage become legal. The two men have been together for 45 years, after first meeting on Easter Day in 1970. They now live in what they describe as ""a pretty conservative Republican neighborhood"" in a Pittsburgh suburb with their giant schnauzer, Yuri. And like so many other loving couples, they'd like to get married.But for Bosee and Esposito, there's a catch: Since 2013, Eposito has legally been Bosee's father.Before marriage equality, some gays and lesbians adopted their partner so they simply would have some legal rights that they wouldn't have otherwise. It wasn't ideal, but it was the only path offered under the law. Bosee said they decided to look into adoption when they were rewriting their wills. The inheritance tax is significantly steeper when a person bequests to a non-family member, but that wasn't the main reason they did it. ""The only option we had at the time was doing this, and this sort of was a legal completion to something that we had always felt. Not that we were father and son, but that we were like a family,"" Bosee said.""The adoption process was very simple,"" he added.Other couples in this situation have been able to annul their adoptions and get married. Bosee and Esposito even have friends in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, who seamlessly went through this process. So they decided to go through with their own annulment in early 2015, after Pennsylvania had legalized same-sex marriage but before the U.S. Supreme Court would eventually do so. In June, however, Allegheny County Judge Lawrence O'Toole denied their request. Although he has a reputation for being progressive and was ""sensitive"" to their situation, he argued that state adoption law simply didn't allow him to move forward. O'Toole said courts have generally reversed adoptions in cases of fraud, and he requested direction from higher courts. Aaron Tax, director of federal government relations at Services and Advocacy for GLBT Elders, said many lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender older adults felt compelled to, like Bosee and Esposito, ""resort to any means necessary to protect their rights in the face of our country's discriminatory marriage laws.""""We believe the justice system should do all it can to ensure that these individuals are able to access the rights and privileges of marriage they've only now been given access to after decades of facing unconstitutional discrimination,"" he added. Bosee and Esoposito's story first went public when the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette ran a front-page, above-the-fold story about them in early October. This week, they received another boost when Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch, requesting that the Justice Department ""consider issuing guidance for courts across the country so that gay couples who have previously entered into adoptions can annul them in order to receive marriage licenses.""As Casey pointed out, in at least 25 states, including Pennsylvania, marriage between a parent and an adopted child is considered incest. Therefore, Bosee and Esposito need an annulment. Andrew Gross, one of the couple's attorneys, said he is not aware of any other couple in their situation. Justice Department spokeswoman Dena Iverson said they are reviewing the letter. Since Casey's letter, Bosee and Esposito have received a flood of national media attention, which they admitted has required a bit of an adjustment. They grew up in a time when being gay was not as widely accepted as it is now, and they're not used to talking about their relationship. They never even openly discussed it with their parents, who have all passed away. ""Generally speaking, as far as our behavior, we've always been very below the radar -- closed about all of this. We never can say we officially 'came out,' so all this publicity now within a few days or a couple weeks has been a little bit overwhelming. It's sort of like coming out by cannon fire,"" Bosee said. Bosee and Esposito said they've been very encouraged by the support they've received from people who have seen the news stories, even in their conservative neighborhood. ""They always used to say there's a difference between knowing and knowing,"" Bosee added, ""and a lot of people would rather have it be the former and somehow once you make it official -- not so much maybe today, but even as recently as 10 years or more, it could be sort of uncomfortable for them or us or anybody if they officially knew the situation.""The couple and their attorneys expect to receive a ruling from the Superior Court early next year. The American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania has filed an amicus brief in support of the couple as well.In the meantime, Bosee and Esposito wait -- and continue to answer questions about their situation from people who are unfamiliar with what gay couples have had to go through to obtain some sort of basic legal protections. And one question they keep having to answer is: Why did they decide to go through all this, other than for financial reasons?""And I always say, does anybody ask a heterosexual couple why they're getting married? ... It's ridiculous. It's unheard of,"" Bosee said. ""Yet when a same-sex couple is getting married, especially going from what we want to be doing -- going from an adoption to a marriage -- that's the first thing they want to ask. I think it's really crazy, if you stand back and look at it.""Also on HuffPost: "
24,SCIENCE,Jupiter May Be To Blame For The Fate Of Our Solar System's Missing Planet,Jacqueline Howard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jupiter-lost-planet-solar-system_us_563cdf69e4b0b24aee4a0d6c,"The planet -- which would have been our solar system's fifth giant -- had a bumpy ride on its way out, scientists say.",2015-11-07,An artist's impression of the missing ice giant planet that may have been ejected from the early solar system.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55ccbd461d00006e00144b92.jpeg?cache=IShfo7hcdO&ops=crop_0_656_4000_2144%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Scientists have long suspected that our solar system was once home to a mysterious planet -- similar to the four giants Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune -- but something happened about four billion years ago that caused the planet to disappear.Now, a team of astrophysicists in Toronto have made significant steps towards solving the mystery.According to new research, published in the latest issue of The Astronomical Journal, a collision with Jupiter resulted in the ancient planet being ejected from our solar system.""This is consistent with our expectation that if you want to eject a planet from the solar system, then you likely need a massive planet,"" Ryan Cloutier, a Ph.D candidate in the University of Toronto's department of astronomy and astrophysics and lead author of the new research, told The Huffington Post in an email. ""Although our results may not have been that surprising, I was very excited.""The researchers created computer simulations of our solar system's four giant planets and their moons, including Jupiter's moon Callisto and Saturn's moon Iapetus.In a process of elimination, the researchers then measured whether each moon in the solar system would have still followed its current orbit if its host planet was responsible for ejecting the ancient lost planet some four billion years ago.The researchers found that Jupiter, the largest world in our solar system, was the only one capable of ejecting the lost planet while retaining the current orbits of its moons.For instance, in order for Saturn to have ejected the long-lost planet, the collision of the two planets would have been so violent that Iapetus's orbit around Saturn would have been thrown off course.""Conversely,"" Cloutier said, ""if you run the same experiment with Jupiter you find that Jupiter is capable of ejecting the fifth giant planet whilst retaining an orbit of its moon Callisto.""The researchers concluded that a planetary collision with Jupiter was sufficient to eject the lost planet -- which they believe was an ice giant like Uranus and Neptune -- out of our solar system. Their simulations also provide evidence that the long-lost ice giant indeed was once part of our solar system.""I was happy because this meant that we don't refute the existence of the fifth giant planet,"" Cloutier said. ""Having had a fifth giant planet that got ejected from our solar system billions of years ago is cool."" It turns out that the planet may have had a bumpy ride before it was booted from our solar system. In August, a separate team of researchers created computer simulations that suggested the ice planet may have knocked into Neptune before it was ejected.Dr. David Nesvorny, an astronomer at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, who led the Neptune study, told HuffPost that his simulations seem to align with the findings in the new research. ""In fact, it is expected from [our] modeling ... that Jupiter, and not Saturn, should eject the hypothetical third ice giant,"" Nesvorny said. The new findings not only hold clues to how our own solar system evolved, but also the researchers noted that they could shed light on how other planetary systems may behave.""Developing an intimate understanding of our own solar system, especially at times long before we were even around, has important implications for our understanding of exoplanetary systems and how they compare to us,"" Cloutier said.""Is our solar system unique,"" he added, ""or does our evolution and current state fit nicely within the framework set by the thousands of other solar systems that we know about today?""Previously: Our Solar System May Have Had A Fifth 'Giant' Planet Also on HuffPost:"
