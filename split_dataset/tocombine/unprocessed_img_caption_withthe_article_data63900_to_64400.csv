Dion's brother, Daniel Dion, also died two days after Angélil. The singer honored her late husband of over 20 years with a moving montage of photos and video that can be seen on her website. The tribute also included an emotional message. ""I understood that my career was in a way his masterpiece, his song, his symphony,"" said the text in the tribute. ""The idea of leaving it unfinished would have hurt him terribly. I realized that if he ever left us, I would have to continue without him, for him.""Dion teared up a few times throughout the night, breaking down during a performance of ""All by Myself."" She finished the performance like a true professional, as the crowd cheered her on. ""Throughout my life, I only had eyes for my husband, who sat out here, night after night,"" Dion said at one point during the show. ""People thought that I was looking at him actually but I didn't have to, I didn't need to, because every time I closed my eyes, I felt René on stage with me."" Also on HuffPost: "
1,POLITICS,Obama Loses Key Potential Republican Ally On Guantanamo Bay Closure,Tyler Tynes,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-mccain-barack-obama-guantanamo-bay_us_56cde34be4b0928f5a6df9b3,John McCain said the Pentagon's plan on Guantanamo is more like a wish list.,2016-02-24,"Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain (R-Ariz.) speaks at a news conference at the U.S. Capitol on Feb. 24, 2016 in Washington, DC, where the Obama administration's Guantanamo Bay closure plan was called ""jibberish.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56cde47e1e0000220070ea88.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz) said Wednesday he would support suing President Barack Obama if he moves Guantanamo Bay detainees to the United States.“Absolutely,” McCain said about supporting a potential House Republican-backed lawsuit against closing Guantanamo. “One of our greatest concerns right now is the president’s proclivity to act by executive order, whether it’s constitutional or not. Clearly if he did that, he would be in direct violation of provisions of the NDAA,” he continued, referring to the annual defense spending bill that includes amendments barring the president from moving detainees state-side. “We would absolutely join one. But we would act as quickly as possible.”Republicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee, including McCain, the committee's chair, and Sens. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), slammed the plan the Pentagon released Tuesday, outlining a proposal to close the detention facility by transferring as many detainees as possible to third-party countries and moving the remaining individuals -- thought to be between 30 and 60 -- to a facility in the U.S. The Pentagon’s plan, however, failed to solve the conflict between Obama’s promised aspirations to close the detention center and the congressionally-imposed ban on moving detainees to the U.S.McCain wants the Pentagon's plan to contain more specifics. He said he wants to know where the administration plans to relocate the detainees, and which locations it has looked at that could replace Guantanamo. He criticized the report for lacking detail on modifications and costs of a new facility, and noted that there was no policy on current detainees and future detainees, or where pending military commissions would take place.Ayotte called for a specific plan on where and how the military will interrogate and detain future “terrorists” captured on the battlefield for what she claimed was for the betterment of the American people and a notion her constituents in New Hampshire agreed with.The senators' overall complaint was that what the Obama administration released wasn't a plan, but rather, a few pages of facts and -- really, as McCain put it -- just a wish list.“I’ve been waiting seven and a half years for a plan in order for us to facilitate the closure of Guantanamo Bay. I’m still waiting,” McCain said. “This is not a plan. This is an eight page document, seven pages of which are rehash and the last page is basically platitude.”Graham echoed McCain’s criticisms, calling the Pentagon’s proposal a “joke.”“There was a time when Senator McCain and myself would have stood with the president to close this facility and open up a new one inside the United States that adheres to our values and recognizes we are at war. That time period has passed and it’s unfortunate. The president could never pull the trigger,” Graham continued.McCain and Graham were some of the earliest Republican supporters of closing Guantanamo. Graham authored a potential bargain proposal in 2009 just after Obama entered office and McCain led a similar effort last year.Blaming Obama’s lack of a realistic plan, but likely bolstered by increasingly partisan politics on Guantanamo during an election year, McCain and Graham have both rolled back their support.While the Pentagon’s plan envisioned working with Congress to find a way to transfer the 30 to 60 prisoners who will not be sent abroad to a U.S. facility, it appears unlikely that congressional Republicans will be willing to undo the legal restrictions.If Congress doesn't budge, Obama hasn’t ruled out bypassing it and using his executive authority to close the prison -- but at the risk of inviting a lawsuit from Republicans.On the other side of the Hill Wednesday, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters that the House was making “legal preparations” if Obama moves forward with his attempt to close Guantanamo Bay.“What boggles my mind is that the president is contemplating directing the military to knowingly break the law,” he said. “By the way, Democrats wrote this law when they were the majority, when they ran Congress,” Ryan continued, glossing over the fact that the restrictions were included as amendments for a compromise on a must-pass spending bill.

2,LATINO VOICES,Most Latinos Don’t Believe They Need To Be Able To Do This To Be Latino,Tanisha Love Ramirez,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/most-latinos-dont-believe-they-need-to-be-able-to-do-this-to-be-latino_us_56cc9bcde4b041136f18712e,A new survey revealed a majority of Latinos don't think fluency in Spanish is required to be Latino.,2016-02-24,Most Hispanics say speaking Spanish not necessary to be considered Hispanic,http://www.pewresearch.org/files/2016/02/FT_16.02.16_hispanic_language.png,"Is it necessary to speak Spanish in order to be considered Latino? Well, that depends on who you ask. A recent Pew Research survey, released Friday, found that though a majority of Latinos feel it's important that future generations speak Spanish, many do not believe Spanish is a necessary component of Latino identity.According to the report, 71 percent of Latinos do not think speaking Spanish is necessary to be considered Latino, whereas only 28 percent feel that it is.""Among Hispanics, views on speaking Spanish and Hispanic identity differ,"" wrote Mark Hugo Lopez, the director of Hispanic research at the Pew Research Center in a Pew blog post. ""Though majorities of all key subgroups say speaking Spanish isn't necessary to be considered Hispanic."" Of the 1,500 Latino adults surveyed for Pew’s 2015 National Survey of Latinos, 87 percent of U.S.-born and 58 percent of foreign-born participants said fluency in Spanish is not required to be Latino. However, 95 percent of all respondents said they do think ""it is important that future generations speak Spanish.""“While language use differs among Hispanics -- some speak only English, some speak only Spanish and some are bilingual -- Spanish is still a characteristic that, for the most part, unites much of group,” Lopez said. ""About three-quarters of Latinos, no matter where they are from, speak Spanish at home."" The role Spanish plays in the Latino identity is a hot button topic that's widely disputed among Latinos, everywhere, including family gatherings, among friends, online and even in the media. Chicago-raised, Puerto Rican actress Gina Rodriguez has repeatedly spoken out against the notion that fluency is necessary to be Latino. The actress explained to HuffPost Live in October why her parents chose to raise her speaking English. ""They wanted to assimilate us into a culture that wouldn't, right away, put up their guard against us because of our accent,"" she said.“I am as Latina as they come,” she continued. “And I am not defined by anybody's definition of Latina.” Latino culture is too rich, diverse and beautiful to ever be reduced to a single trait. So be proud and keep speaking out -- in whatever language you choose. Also on HuffPost: "
3,POLITICS,These Panels Could Be The Best Hope For Innocent Victims Of The Criminal Justice System,Matt Ferner,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/conviction-integrity-units-overturn-case_us_56cd4a4ae4b0ec6725e472ba,False evidence and faulty investigations are just some of the issues conviction integrity units must review to right the wrongs of the past.,2016-02-24,"Since Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson took office in 2014, his review team has overturned a total of 19 wrongful convictions.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56cde2c31500002a000b09b9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Vanessa Gathers was convicted on robbery and assault charges in 1998 for the death of a 71-year-old Brooklyn man. She was sentenced to 10 years in prison, served out her full term and spent five more years on parole -- all for a crime she never committed.Gathers initially denied being involved in the 1991 assault and death of the victim, Michael Shaw. But six years later, she confessed to disgraced NYPD Detective Louis Scarcella, who is now retired and being accused by defendants like Gathers of using tactics known to produce false evidence.The confession Scarcella elicited from Gathers -- the only evidence presented against her in trial, according to prosecutors -- was enough to lock her up for a decade.On Tuesday, she was finally exonerated, thanks to a review team established in 2011 and embedded within the Brooklyn district attorney's office that investigates and reverses unjust convictions built on faulty evidence. In Gathers' case, Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson said that Scarcella had coaxed a false confession out of her and that she was wrongfully convicted in Shaw's death.Gathers is now the first woman exonerated by the Conviction Review Unit of Thompson’s office. A relatively new and growing phenomenon in criminal justice, the conviction integrity unit is a division of a prosecutorial office that works to identify and correct false convictions -- convictions often secured through malfeasance, intentional or otherwise, by prosecutors or police; flaws in an investigation; or unreliable forensic science.Since Thompson took office in 2014, the review team under his leadership has overturned a total of 19 wrongful convictions, most for murder, according to the National Registry of Exonerations, a project of the University of Michigan Law School. His office is a national leader in exonerations, especially when it comes to murder cases.“These are hugely complicated investigations and Thompson’s conviction review unit has been doing them at a pace no one else does,” Samuel Gross, University of Michigan law professor and editor of the registry’s annual report on exonerations, told The Huffington Post. The very first CIU was established in 2002 in Santa Clara County, California, and now, more than a decade later, there are 24 such units in the U.S. That's not a huge number considering the more than 2,300 prosecutor offices across the nation, but it's growing fast -- CIUs have doubled over the past two years and quadrupled since 2011.The increased presence of CIUs coincides with recent record-high numbers of exonerations. In 2015, almost 150 people were cleared for crimes they never committed, more than any other year in history, according to the National Registry’s report. CIUs were responsible for 58 of those cases last year, also a record.But the performance of these units varies widely. Half of the nation’s CIUs have not produced any exonerations since their inception. And just three units are responsible for about 90 percent of all ​CIU exonerations in 2015​ -- half of which came from a single CIU in Harris County, Texas.Lagging productivity isn’t necessarily a sign of an ineffective CIU, Gross says. Some are actively working on complex cases that can take years to bear fruit, while others may be constricted by small budgets or staff. CIUs may also focus the bulk of their work on reducing wrongful convictions by reforming investigative practices.However, critics of CIUs say that there is an inherent conflict of interest at play, as units are established within prosecutors’ offices to critically reassess possible misconduct by prosecutors in the very same offices.The close relationship these CIUs have with county prosecutors has led some to accuse several of these units of being little more than “public relations ploys,” especially when the unit has no external oversight nor any relationships with other key stakeholders like local defense attorneys or groups focused on correcting wrongful convictions, Gross notes in his report.Daniel Medwed, a law professor at Northeastern University who has written about prosecutorial misconduct in depth, told HuffPost that many CIUs function, to some extent, on a “trust us” mentality, which he says is problematic. “Trust us to look into these cases, trust us to bring them to the attention of the courts. The problem, of course, is that the trust isn't there -- and for good reason,” Medwed said.Prosecutors aren’t used to being second-guessed. They are the most powerful government agents in the American criminal justice system. They have complete and unrivaled access to evidence that can determine a person’s guilt or innocence. And they are largely shielded from any liability for their actions, thanks to a Supreme Court ruling granting them “absolute immunity.” When a prosecutor is behaving ethically, as the vast majority do, that power benefits both the state and the defendant. But even one bad actor in a prosecutor’s office can have a significant impact on countless defendants and cases.“There are disturbing indications that a non-trivial number of prosecutors -- and sometimes entire prosecutorial offices -- engage in misconduct that seriously undermines the fairness of criminal trials,” U.S. Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski, a leading voice on prosecutorial misconduct, wrote last year in a landmark paper critiquing the criminal justice system. “The misconduct ranges from misleading the jury, to outright lying in court and tacitly acquiescing or actively participating in the presentation of false evidence by police.”In other words, the criminal justice system clearly needs an investigative body whose sole purpose is to look for wrongful convictions and rectify them when discovered. But why give that duty to the same team that may have been part of the problem? Ironically, it’s that same power and access, which can enable misconduct, that also puts prosecutors in an ideal position to identify it. Prosecutors have all the evidence, as well as police and investigators at their disposal. A sitting prosecutor can both bring charges against a defendant and request a court to vacate a judgment against them.“This unconstrained prosecutorial authority has two sides,” Gross notes in the registry report. “On the one hand, it permits rapid change. On the other hand, it means that a Conviction Integrity Unit will be whatever the prosecutor in charge makes it, no more, no less.” One problem, Gross writes, is that CIUs are the quickest and easiest way to show a commitment to integrity, however strong it actually is. CIUs don't require legislative action, and can be assembled by any prosecutor with a staff and a budget. And while the dynamic invites concerns about potential conflicts of interest, few other official bodies have the power and reach that prosecutors have to truly root out injustice.North Carolina has created one effective alternative. In 2006, the state legislature established the Innocence Inquiry Commission. In the decade since, the independent body has reviewed and investigated hundreds of cases where defendants have claimed innocence after conviction. The power of the commission lies in its ability to exonerate -- if the commission declares a person innocent, they are innocent. In nine years of activity, the NCIIC has exonerated nine people. The creation of an agency like NCIIC may be favorable, as it exists completely outside of a prosecutor's office, but as Gross notes, it requires legislative action and substantial state funding. And while it has produced results, other states aren't rushing out to establish their own commission. In fact, no other state has gone on to create a similar agency.Despite the apprehension, CIUs do show tremendous promise when properly established and regulated. But for two of the most widely celebrated CIUs -- in Brooklyn and in Dallas, a team responsible for 25 exonerations since 2008 -- their results aren't the only metric for success. Both bodies have set up close working relationships with a host of authorities outside of their own prosecutorial office, including local defense attorneys, public defenders and nonprofit organizations dedicated to overturning wrongful convictions, like the Innocence Project. Gross also points out that the Dallas CIU is run by an attorney who has extensive experience in criminal defense and innocence work, and that the Brooklyn CIU was designed, in part, by a former public defender and has an external review panel that includes defense lawyers.“This trend needs to continue and escalate,” Kozinski, the judge, wrote about the recent growth in conviction integrity units. “We know that there are innocent people languishing in prison, but figuring out who they are is very difficult -- more so if the prosecution, which has control of whatever evidence there is, is fighting you tooth and nail.”While imperfect, these integrity units may be the most practical tool we have to right some of the wrongs committed by the most powerful players in the criminal justice system."

When she finished the song, the 19-year-old stood on stage with a smile on her face and her hands to her heart as the crowd cheered her on. The tribute was no doubt an emotional one for Lorde, who, following Bowie's death, shared a touching note on Facebook, beautifully recalling the time she met him.""I think in those brief moments, he heralded me into my next new life, an old rock and roll alien angel in a perfect grey suit,"" she wrote. ""I realized everything I’d ever done, or would do from then on, would be done like maybe he was watching. I realized I was proud of my spiky strangeness because he had been proud of his."" Following the performance, fans, fellow celebrities and Bowie's son, Duncan Jones, shared nothing but love for Lorde on Twitter.

8,POLITICS,This Lawyer's First Supreme Court Case Just Decided The Fate Of Abortion Rights,Laura Bassett,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephanie-toti-abortion-supreme-court_us_56cde23ae4b0ec6725e4afa8,Relatively inexperienced women have now won the three most important abortion rights cases in American history.,2016-02-24,"Stephanie Toti, 37, is arguing the biggest abortion case of the decade before the Supreme Court next week.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56cde5b91500002a000b09c4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In February, The Huffington Post profiled Stephanie Toti as she was preparing to lead the oral arguments in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. On Monday, the Supreme Court handed Toti a victory in the case, striking down both Texas regulations that made it more difficult for clinics to provide abortions.It was pouring rain, but the Capitol Police would not let the 26-year-old and her colleagues pitch a tent. So they laid in sleeping bags on the concrete, miserable, huddled together. The next morning, they stood in line in their soaking-wet clothes, hoping to get seats for oral arguments in the most important abortion rights case of the last decade.After camping in the rain all night, Toti and her co-workers -- junior employees at the Center for Reproductive Rights, a legal advocacy group that defends abortion rights around the globe -- managed to nab a few spots in the last row.“Some of our colleagues who had tickets to the arguments came around in the morning and brought us suits so we could change our clothes after we got into the courthouse and be appropriately dressed,” Toti said. “I remember sitting in the back and thinking, ‘Wow, this courtroom is so big!’” Toti’s side lost. In a 5-4 decision authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the high court upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act -- a federal law passed in 2003 that prohibited a specific kind of surgical abortion procedure.Now, a decade later, Toti is preparing to argue her first Supreme Court case -- the most significant abortion trial of this century. On March 2, she'll take the lead in oral arguments on Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, a case that could determine whether women in Texas and across the country will have access to abortion services in their communities. The case challenges the constitutionality of two Texas abortion restrictions passed in 2013 that were designed to shut down most of the clinics in the state. The decision will not only determine the fate of abortion access in Texas; it will also send a signal to other states about the appropriateness of similar laws. Most litigators who argue big cases before the Supreme Court are white men who have done it before. An elite group of 66 lawyers -- only eight of whom are women -- argued nearly half of the cases before the high court from 2004 to 2012, according to a 2014 Reuters analysis of 17,000 attorneys. Some of those attorneys have argued dozens of cases before the court, and nearly half of them are graduates of Harvard or Yale law schools who clerked for Supreme Court justices after graduation. That narrow representation turns the court into what the Reuters investigators described as an “echo chamber.""But in the most consequential abortion rights cases, the reproductive rights movement has repeatedly turned to relatively inexperienced women. Sarah Weddington was 27 when she argued and won Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that legalized abortion throughout the United States. Weddington had no previous experience with the high court. “Because I hadn’t been able to get a job with a law firm, I didn’t have any real experience,” Weddington told Ms. Magazine last year. “I had done one adoption for my uncle, some divorces for people with no real assets to divide up, a couple of wills for people with very little money. I had not done Big Law.”In 1992, reproductive rights advocates chose Kathryn Kolbert to represent them in the case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which challenged a Pennsylvania law requiring a 24-hour waiting period and spousal notification before a woman could obtain an abortion. Kolbert, then a 40-year-old attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, had only argued one case before the Supreme Court, but she claimed a narrow victory over Pennsylvania’s Republican attorney general. The court ruled that states can regulate abortion, but cannot place an ""undue burden"" on the right to obtain one.  Toti, who is now 37, has argued dozens of abortion cases in district and federal courts, and she briefly clerked for U.S. District Judge Nina Gershon in New York in 2005. But she has never argued before the Supreme Court. She lives in a modest walk-up apartment in Brooklyn with a roommate and occasionally attends Catholic mass with her sprawling Italian-American family on Long Island. She is humble and soft-spoken in our interview in her office in Manhattan, which is filled with cards bearing supportive messages from her co-workers: “Uteruses before duderuses” and “Ovaries before brovaries.” Her nails are painted bright purple -- her favorite color, and also the color of the marketing materials for Whole Woman's Health, the chain of Texas clinics she represents.Toti's opponent, Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller, argued two cases before the Supreme Court in 2015, and clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy -- the justice expected to be the swing vote in the case. Keller's team doesn’t appear to be taking its less-experienced female opponent seriously. As the case wound its way through the lower courts, Toti repeatedly had to remind the Texas attorneys that she is the lead counsel on the case. But they consistently directed communications to her co-counsel -- a taller, slightly older man from the international law firm Morrison & Foerster. “They would always reach out to him and not even 'cc' me,"" she said. “I would get back to the lawyers and say, ‘Here is our position,’ and the next time they would go back to him anyway.” Toti's co-counsel, Alex Lawrence, said the Texas attorneys are ignoring his colleague because she’s a woman. ""I feel bad about it, but yes, it’s true,"" he said in a phone interview. ""They’re not comfortable with it completely. Maybe it’s a Texas thing, or maybe it’s just a man thing."" Being underestimated is “frustrating, but motivating,” Toti said. And she needs the boost -- the outcome of her first Supreme Court case will determine whether millions of American women will still be able to access abortion in their states. “I definitely feel the pressure,” she said. “So much hangs in the balance.”In the 2010 midterm elections, a new crop of ultra-conservative Republicans swept statehouses across the country, bringing with them a fresh determination to rid the country of legal abortion. Over the next five years, these lawmakers passed an unprecedented number of abortion restrictions that shut down dozens of clinics across the country. Their strategy was simple: Instead of passing outright bans on legal abortion that would be difficult to defend in court, states passed so many new regulations on abortion clinics and doctors that few providers would be able to meet the requirements and stay open.In 2013, Texas enacted two of these so-called TRAP laws (""TRAP"" stands for Targeted Regulation of Abortion Providers). The laws mandate that all abortions take place in ambulatory surgical centers, or mini-hospitals, and that all abortion providers must have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital. The extensive renovations required to turn a clinic into a mini-hospital, such as specific hallway widths, large janitors' closets and new ventilation systems, are too expensive for most clinic owners to undertake. And hospitals in Texas often refuse to grant admitting privileges to abortion providers for political or religious reasons that have nothing to do with the doctor’s experience or safety record. By the middle of 2014, 20 of the state’s 42 clinics had shut down, forcing many women in poor, rural areas of the state to travel up to 300 miles to the nearest clinic. Women’s health advocates complained that the restrictions did not appear to be medically necessary -- abortions are already remarkably safe, and in the event of an emergency, hospitals have to admit women whether the doctor performing the abortion has admitting privileges or not. “These laws don’t provide any material benefit to abortion patients,” Toti said. In August 2014, the Center for Reproductive Rights -- with Toti as lead counsel -- sued Texas, arguing that the new restrictions were irrelevant to women’s health and imposed an unconstitutional burden on their access to safe and legal abortion. Toti won in district court and lost in the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In November, the Supreme Court agreed to take the case.Toti’s task in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt is to convince the court -- specifically, Kennedy -- that the new regulations are not medically necessary, that lawmakers passed them with the sole intent of eradicating legal abortion in Texas, and that the rules do indeed impede women’s ability to exercise their constitutional right to an abortion. Her team has taken a novel approach in its argument, submitting a document to the court in which 113 female attorneys share stories of their own abortions and explain how access to the procedure allowed them to break the cycles of poverty, abuse and teenage motherhood in their families and rise into successful careers. The state of Texas will argue that the clinic regulations are necessary to protect the health and safety of women. “The state has wide discretion to pass laws ensuring Texas women are not subject to substandard conditions at abortion facilities,” Ken Paxton, Texas’ attorney general, said in a statement when the Supreme Court agreed to review the case last November.The death of conservative Justice Antonin Scalia earlier this month does not change much about Toti's case. If Kennedy sides with Whole Woman's Health, the Texas restrictions will be struck down. But if he sides with the state, that will create a 4-4 tie, which will mean that a lower court decision that upheld Texas' abortion restrictions will stand. As she prepares for next week's oral arguments, Toti is trying to avoid psychoanalyzing Kennedy. Instead, she is practicing with experienced Supreme Court lawyers who shoot rapid-fire questions at her in moot courts, interrupting her as the justices will. These dress rehearsals can be humbling.“There have definitely been moments of remorse,” she said. “Everyone's jumping in and asking these really hard questions, and I reach a point where I'm like, ‘When is this going to end?’” At the gym or at the grocery store, Toti listens to audio recordings of past oral arguments on her headphones. Sometimes a dream about the case will wake her up in the middle of the night, and she'll jump out of bed to scribble down the ideas cycling through her head. The notes rarely make any sense the next morning. “I’m not going to give you a specific example,” she said, laughing, “because I don't want to tip off the other side to the kind of nonsense I'm coming up with.” When the Supreme Court agreed to take the case, Toti's bosses briefly considered replacing her with a more experienced Supreme Court lawyer. She lobbied to keep the case, noting that she had already taken the lead in district and appellate arguments. She convinced them. When she found out she'd argue the case, she was ""really excited,” she recalled. “And then, you know, a moment later, slightly terrified.” Lawrence, her co-counsel, isn't as worried.“Stephanie knows the case backwards and forwards,"" he said. ""Every nook and cranny of the case, she knows. That is an asset that cannot be undervalued.”""I would not have wanted anyone else to argue this case,"" he added. ""Including myself."""
9,POLITICS,This Lawyer's First Supreme Court Case Just Decided The Fate Of Abortion Rights,Laura Bassett,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stephanie-toti-abortion-supreme-court_us_56cde23ae4b0ec6725e4afa8,Relatively inexperienced women have now won the three most important abortion rights cases in American history.,2016-02-24,T-shirts on display at Whole Woman's Health of San Antonio. The Supreme Court will soon hear the organization's challenge to Texas legislation that requires all abortion facilities to meet increased requirements by becoming ambulatory service centers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In February, The Huffington Post profiled Stephanie Toti as she was preparing to lead the oral arguments in Whole Woman’s Health v. Hellerstedt. On Monday, the Supreme Court handed Toti a victory in the case, striking down both Texas regulations that made it more difficult for clinics to provide abortions.It was pouring rain, but the Capitol Police would not let the 26-year-old and her colleagues pitch a tent. So they laid in sleeping bags on the concrete, miserable, huddled together. The next morning, they stood in line in their soaking-wet clothes, hoping to get seats for oral arguments in the most important abortion rights case of the last decade.After camping in the rain all night, Toti and her co-workers -- junior employees at the Center for Reproductive Rights, a legal advocacy group that defends abortion rights around the globe -- managed to nab a few spots in the last row.“Some of our colleagues who had tickets to the arguments came around in the morning and brought us suits so we could change our clothes after we got into the courthouse and be appropriately dressed,” Toti said. “I remember sitting in the back and thinking, ‘Wow, this courtroom is so big!’” Toti’s side lost. In a 5-4 decision authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the high court upheld the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act -- a federal law passed in 2003 that prohibited a specific kind of surgical abortion procedure.Now, a decade later, Toti is preparing to argue her first Supreme Court case -- the most significant abortion trial of this century. On March 2, she'll take the lead in oral arguments on Whole Woman's Health v. Hellerstedt, a case that could determine whether women in Texas and across the country will have access to abortion services in their communities. The case challenges the constitutionality of two Texas abortion restrictions passed in 2013 that were designed to shut down most of the clinics in the state. The decision will not only determine the fate of abortion access in Texas; it will also send a signal to other states about the appropriateness of similar laws. Most litigators who argue big cases before the Supreme Court are white men who have done it before. An elite group of 66 lawyers -- only eight of whom are women -- argued nearly half of the cases before the high court from 2004 to 2012, according to a 2014 Reuters analysis of 17,000 attorneys. Some of those attorneys have argued dozens of cases before the court, and nearly half of them are graduates of Harvard or Yale law schools who clerked for Supreme Court justices after graduation. That narrow representation turns the court into what the Reuters investigators described as an “echo chamber.""But in the most consequential abortion rights cases, the reproductive rights movement has repeatedly turned to relatively inexperienced women. Sarah Weddington was 27 when she argued and won Roe v. Wade, the 1973 case that legalized abortion throughout the United States. Weddington had no previous experience with the high court. “Because I hadn’t been able to get a job with a law firm, I didn’t have any real experience,” Weddington told Ms. Magazine last year. “I had done one adoption for my uncle, some divorces for people with no real assets to divide up, a couple of wills for people with very little money. I had not done Big Law.”In 1992, reproductive rights advocates chose Kathryn Kolbert to represent them in the case Planned Parenthood v. Casey, which challenged a Pennsylvania law requiring a 24-hour waiting period and spousal notification before a woman could obtain an abortion. Kolbert, then a 40-year-old attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, had only argued one case before the Supreme Court, but she claimed a narrow victory over Pennsylvania’s Republican attorney general. The court ruled that states can regulate abortion, but cannot place an ""undue burden"" on the right to obtain one.  Toti, who is now 37, has argued dozens of abortion cases in district and federal courts, and she briefly clerked for U.S. District Judge Nina Gershon in New York in 2005. But she has never argued before the Supreme Court. She lives in a modest walk-up apartment in Brooklyn with a roommate and occasionally attends Catholic mass with her sprawling Italian-American family on Long Island. She is humble and soft-spoken in our interview in her office in Manhattan, which is filled with cards bearing supportive messages from her co-workers: “Uteruses before duderuses” and “Ovaries before brovaries.” Her nails are painted bright purple -- her favorite color, and also the color of the marketing materials for Whole Woman's Health, the chain of Texas clinics she represents.Toti's opponent, Texas Solicitor General Scott Keller, argued two cases before the Supreme Court in 2015, and clerked for Justice Anthony Kennedy -- the justice expected to be the swing vote in the case. Keller's team doesn’t appear to be taking its less-experienced female opponent seriously. As the case wound its way through the lower courts, Toti repeatedly had to remind the Texas attorneys that she is the lead counsel on the case. But they consistently directed communications to her co-counsel -- a taller, slightly older man from the international law firm Morrison & Foerster. “They would always reach out to him and not even 'cc' me,"" she said. “I would get back to the lawyers and say, ‘Here is our position,’ and the next time they would go back to him anyway.” Toti's co-counsel, Alex Lawrence, said the Texas attorneys are ignoring his colleague because she’s a woman.

""So at a minimum, I think Congress needs to do that. Then I think we need to look at what happens in Colorado and what happens in Washington.""Colorado and Washington have legalized recreational marijuana use over the past few years, and Alaska, Oregon and Washington, D.C., have since followed suit. A number of other states have decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana.""Frontline"" conducted the wide-ranging interview on drug policy last year after Holder's departure from the administration, and released it Tuesday along with the program's most recent documentary on the heroin crisis.Holder has signaled support for rescheduling marijuana in the past, as far back as 2014, when he was still attorney general. During an interview with Katie Couric, he similarly questioned the wisdom of keeping marijuana in the same category as heroin, a drug that is rightly considered to have a high potential for abuse and dependence.But while the nation's former chief law enforcement officer has expressed disagreement with marijuana's current scheduling, he has been hesitant to propose aggressive action to change it.At a congressional hearing in 2014, Holder said he'd be ""more than glad to work with Congress"" to reclassify weed. He echoed those comments in his ""Frontline"" interview, saying any move to adjust the federal classification of marijuana would have to come from Congress. President Barack Obama has taken a similar stance, while current Attorney General Loretta Lynch has been relatively silent on rescheduling efforts.But some legal experts say the executive branch -- and more specifically, the attorney general -- actually has the power to reschedule a drug unilaterally. Here's a quick and easy breakdown of how that would work, via the Brookings Institution.Tom Angell, chairman of the advocacy group Marijuana Majority, believes Holder could have done more to address rescheduling as attorney general.“It’s nice to have Holder’s support for this sensible policy change, but it would have been a lot better if he’d exercised the power to get marijuana rescheduling done while he was still in office,"" Angell said. ""We know that Holder and President Obama are good friends, so I hope the former attorney general encourages his former boss and his successor Loretta Lynch to follow through during these final months of the administration and get the job done.""Moving marijuana into a lower schedule wouldn't make it legal under federal law, but it would, among other changes, open the door for further scientific research that advocates say would lead to a fuller understanding of the drug's medical benefits.Also on HuffPost:"

Brian Finn, who works at Infinite Art Tattoo in Toledo, Ohio, spends one day a week inking over people's scars from domestic violence, human trafficking or self-harm -- for free. The artist, who began his compassionate project back in October, has worked on five tattoos thus far with many more to come. He explains that he does it all to help others feel empowered. ""It's just something I can do that won't take much time that can make a big impact on other people,"" Finn, who's been tattooing for almost 17 years, told The Huffington Post of his thoughtful initiative. ""A tattoo can help disguise the scars, so ... it's like a new chapter.""Finn explained that over the years, he's encountered many clients who have scars from trauma and wanted to ink over them. However, when Finn would explain the cost he found that many were going through financial challenges and were unable to afford them. The artist eventually decided to set aside time to help individuals, who went through similar obstacles, at no cost so they'd be able to turn over a new leaf no matter their financial situation. Finn has been inking different designs through his initiative, including a Celtic knot, which is an existing tattoo on a client that he's reworking to hide scars, a rose and a skull with pistons. While some open up during their sessions and talk about their experiences, Finn mentioned that he also encounters people who prefer to keep their stories private.He says that ultimately, the people he's worked with feel overjoyed when they see the ink. ""There's definitely been tears involved -- of happiness,"" he said. ""It's been a great response.""Though the artist has worked on five, he's received many requests since the news broke of his initiative and is booked through April with appointments to transform scars.

Yet he lost both states to Donald Trump, finishing fifth in New Hampshire and second in South Carolina.Surely, Nevada would be the place he'd win. National Review had called it his ""firewall."" Wrong again. Rubio lost the Nevada caucuses Tuesday night. Trump won again, drawing further ahead in the delegate race.Nevada was supposed to be a key state for the Florida senator. CNN's John King explained the Rubio campaign's plans for the caucus last year:Plan A: Get at least one win in the first three states (Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina) and then win Nevada as the exclamation point before heading home to the giant Florida GOP primary.Plan A went out the window when Rubio went 0-3 in the first three states. Plan B just died on the Las Vegas strip. Now that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is out of the nomination race, Rubio is the establishment (and media) favorite. But he still hasn't won a single state.If Rubio, the junior senator from Florida, can't pull out a victory in his home state on March 15, where can he win? Remember, the race for the nomination is really a race for delegates, who pick the party's nominee at its July convention. Florida is a winner-take-all primary: Whoever wins will win all of the state's 99 delegates. Rubio trails Trump in the polling average in Florida. But he also trails Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. And if second place in Florida gets no delegates, third place gets even fewer.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S.Also on HuffPost:"

His coalition is so strong that it could erase home-state advantages for Marco Rubio and John Kasich. And most Republicans side with him over the pope, but not over George W. Bush. This is HuffPollster for Wednesday, February 24, 2016.TRUMP'S OUTSIDER APPEAL NETS HIM A WIN IN NEVADA - ABC News: “A new high in desire for an outsider candidate vaulted Donald Trump to a sweeping victory in the Nevada Republican caucuses, completing a three-contest hat trick for the New York billionaire – first New Hampshire, then South Carolina, now Nevada. Six in 10 caucus-goers in entrance poll results said they were looking for someone from outside the political establishment, compared with about half in previous contests. And a smashing 71 percent of them voted for Trump, a record for his populist campaign among outsider voters. Six in 10 also described themselves as angry at the way the federal government is working, compared with four in 10 in the previous three states to hold nominating contests this year.” [ABC]Donald Trump wins Latino Republican support - HuffPollster: “Preliminary entrance polls show Donald Trump winning among Nevada's Latinos, taking 41 percent to Marco Rubio's 29 percent and Ted Cruz's 16 percent….Entrance polls, like any other surveys, aren't an exact science, especially when it comes to very small populations. In this case, the poll included 1,545 people. Just 9 percent -- or about 139 people -- were Latinos. That's a large enough sample size to be worth looking at it, but it carries an extremely high margin of error….Still, even if Tuesday's numbers are off, they show Trump carrying significant support from a group he has repeatedly disparaged. But, as the Cook Political Report's Dave Wasserman notes, that's not exactly the same thing as support among the Latino community as a whole.” [HuffPost]Rubio and Cruz in a close race for second - While Trump pulled 46 percent of the Nevada GOP vote, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) split another 45 percent between them. Rubio took second place with 24 percent support over Cruz’s 21 percent. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Ohio Gov. John Kasich lagged far behind. THERE MIGHT BE NO SUCH THING AS HOME-STATE ADVANTAGE FOR GOP CONTENDERS - Philip Bump: ""Of the four candidates still in the race (Carson having dropped out in spirit a few weeks ago), two are poised to win their home states, per the most recent polling, and two are not. Sure, John Kasich is close in Ohio -- but only half of his supporters say they're committed to backing him. By contrast, 78 percent of Ohio Republicans backing Donald Trump say they're sticking with him. In Texas, Cruz's lead appears safer: About two-thirds of his support and two-thirds of Trump's say they're committed."" [WashPost] MOST REPUBLICANS SIDE WITH TRUMP OVER THE POPE - HuffPollster: ""[Trump] took on both the religious and political establishment last week -- in the form of the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the most recent Republican president, respectively -- and went on to handily win the South Carolina primary. But while neither Trump's feud with Pope Francis nor his criticism of President George W. Bush proved especially detrimental to him, Republicans view the two spats quite differently. In a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, just 10 percent of Republicans agree with Pope Francis that Trump's plan to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico is 'not Christian,' while 61 percent side with Trump, who called the pope's comments 'disgraceful’….If Republicans don't have much respect for the pope, however, they still revere Bush's legacy. In a separate HuffPost/YouGov poll, taken last week after Trump criticized the former president's record on the Iraq War, 83 percent of Republicans approve of Bush's job performance…..Most of them strenuously disagree with Trump's contention that the war 'was a big, fat mistake,' and even more reject that it was started based on lies….But even if Republicans aren't happy to see Trump taking on Bush, his decision to do so doesn't seem to significantly dampen their opinions of him."" [HuffPost] RELIGIOUS GROUPS VARY WIDELY IN PARTISAN AFFILIATION - Michael Lipka: “Mormons are the most heavily Republican-leaning religious group in the U.S., while a pair of major historically black Protestant denominations – the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church and the National Baptist Convention – are two of the most reliably Democratic groups…These patterns largely reflect data from exit polls during the 2012 general election. In that year, 95% of black Protestants said they voted for Democrat Barack Obama, while 78% of Mormons said they voted for Republican Mitt Romney, who also is a Mormon. White evangelical Protestants also voted heavily Republican in 2012 (79% for Romney), which mirrors the leanings of many of the largest evangelical denominations…. Catholics are divided politically in our survey, just as they were in the 2012 election. While 37% say they favor the GOP, 44% identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party (and 19% say they do not lean either way). In the 2012 election, 50% of Catholics said they voted for Obama, while 48% voted for Romney.” [Pew]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

This is HuffPollster for Wednesday, February 24, 2016.TRUMP'S OUTSIDER APPEAL NETS HIM A WIN IN NEVADA - ABC News: “A new high in desire for an outsider candidate vaulted Donald Trump to a sweeping victory in the Nevada Republican caucuses, completing a three-contest hat trick for the New York billionaire – first New Hampshire, then South Carolina, now Nevada. Six in 10 caucus-goers in entrance poll results said they were looking for someone from outside the political establishment, compared with about half in previous contests. And a smashing 71 percent of them voted for Trump, a record for his populist campaign among outsider voters. Six in 10 also described themselves as angry at the way the federal government is working, compared with four in 10 in the previous three states to hold nominating contests this year.” [ABC]Donald Trump wins Latino Republican support - HuffPollster: “Preliminary entrance polls show Donald Trump winning among Nevada's Latinos, taking 41 percent to Marco Rubio's 29 percent and Ted Cruz's 16 percent….Entrance polls, like any other surveys, aren't an exact science, especially when it comes to very small populations. In this case, the poll included 1,545 people. Just 9 percent -- or about 139 people -- were Latinos. That's a large enough sample size to be worth looking at it, but it carries an extremely high margin of error….Still, even if Tuesday's numbers are off, they show Trump carrying significant support from a group he has repeatedly disparaged. But, as the Cook Political Report's Dave Wasserman notes, that's not exactly the same thing as support among the Latino community as a whole.” [HuffPost]Rubio and Cruz in a close race for second - While Trump pulled 46 percent of the Nevada GOP vote, Sens. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) split another 45 percent between them. Rubio took second place with 24 percent support over Cruz’s 21 percent. Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and Ohio Gov. John Kasich lagged far behind. THERE MIGHT BE NO SUCH THING AS HOME-STATE ADVANTAGE FOR GOP CONTENDERS - Philip Bump: ""Of the four candidates still in the race (Carson having dropped out in spirit a few weeks ago), two are poised to win their home states, per the most recent polling, and two are not. Sure, John Kasich is close in Ohio -- but only half of his supporters say they're committed to backing him. By contrast, 78 percent of Ohio Republicans backing Donald Trump say they're sticking with him. In Texas, Cruz's lead appears safer: About two-thirds of his support and two-thirds of Trump's say they're committed."" [WashPost] MOST REPUBLICANS SIDE WITH TRUMP OVER THE POPE - HuffPollster: ""[Trump] took on both the religious and political establishment last week -- in the form of the head of the Roman Catholic Church and the most recent Republican president, respectively -- and went on to handily win the South Carolina primary. But while neither Trump's feud with Pope Francis nor his criticism of President George W. Bush proved especially detrimental to him, Republicans view the two spats quite differently. In a new HuffPost/YouGov poll, just 10 percent of Republicans agree with Pope Francis that Trump's plan to build a wall along the U.S. border with Mexico is 'not Christian,' while 61 percent side with Trump, who called the pope's comments 'disgraceful’….If Republicans don't have much respect for the pope, however, they still revere Bush's legacy. In a separate HuffPost/YouGov poll, taken last week after Trump criticized the former president's record on the Iraq War, 83 percent of Republicans approve of Bush's job performance…..Most of them strenuously disagree with Trump's contention that the war 'was a big, fat mistake,' and even more reject that it was started based on lies….But even if Republicans aren't happy to see Trump taking on Bush, his decision to do so doesn't seem to significantly dampen their opinions of him."" [HuffPost] RELIGIOUS GROUPS VARY WIDELY IN PARTISAN AFFILIATION - Michael Lipka: “Mormons are the most heavily Republican-leaning religious group in the U.S., while a pair of major historically black Protestant denominations – the African Methodist Episcopal (AME) Church and the National Baptist Convention – are two of the most reliably Democratic groups…These patterns largely reflect data from exit polls during the 2012 general election. In that year, 95% of black Protestants said they voted for Democrat Barack Obama, while 78% of Mormons said they voted for Republican Mitt Romney, who also is a Mormon. White evangelical Protestants also voted heavily Republican in 2012 (79% for Romney), which mirrors the leanings of many of the largest evangelical denominations…. Catholics are divided politically in our survey, just as they were in the 2012 election. While 37% say they favor the GOP, 44% identify with or lean toward the Democratic Party (and 19% say they do not lean either way). In the 2012 election, 50% of Catholics said they voted for Obama, while 48% voted for Romney.” [Pew]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

The report revealed, among other things, that non-white speaking characters were not only underrepresented in film, but also television.So when The Huffington Post caught up with Jackée Harry, a television actress best known for her breakout role as Sandra Clark on TV's ""227,"" we asked her for her thoughts on the state of TV diversity and what Hollywood executives can do to help solve the issue. “They need to hire more writers who want to address it, like the man who created ‘How to Get Away with Murder,’” Harry said during an interview with HuffPost. “Shonda Rhimes executive produces it, but the man who created it, Peter Nowalk, he said ‘give me the best actor,’ and he got Viola Davis. And now he said that he’s going to write more and more. So I’m not gonna say it's gotta be a black writer. It's gotta be people that want to see us on TV and who know how to write well, and then it’ll catch on. It's gotta be people who are interested in doing that and not guilt writing. It has to be of greater quality, and can’t be buffoonish. It's gotta be the people who have the vision.”Harry has first-hand experience dealing with Hollywood's diversity issues. In 1987, she became the first and only African-American actress to win an Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy for her role on ""227."" While other African American women, including Viola Davis (2015 Outstanding Lead Actress In A Drama Series), Uzo Aduba (2014 Outstanding Guest Actress In A Comedy Series/2015 Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series) and Regina King (2015 Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series Or A Movie) have all earned Emmy recognition in recent years, Harry says black women in Hollywood “still have a long way to go.""Influential roles, Harry says, are simply not being offered to African American women today.“I hate to say it, but there are no parts being written like that now for African American females. There’s nothing to sink your teeth into,” she said. “I was doing it then, I wasn’t looking at the sort of value of it then, but now I see it. A lot of young women, they wanted to be like Sandra Clark. I was like, ‘Are you sure you want to be like that!?’ Because to me, it was just a character. I didn’t know people looked at that and said, ‘That’s who I want to be.’”You can catch Jackée Harry on February 27 when she hosts the “227” marathon on Logo beginning at 2:27 PM/ET.Also on HuffPost"

It could also save thousands of lives in the U.S. by drastically reducing deaths caused by air pollution.The cuts in carbon emissions needed to limit the rise of global temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (or 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) would significantly reduce other kinds of air pollution, according to a new study by researchers at Duke University and the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies.The study, published Monday in Nature Climate Change, showed that these cuts in pollution could prevent the premature deaths of up to 175,000 people in the U.S. by 2030 and save around $250 billion annually in associated health costs.The new research sheds light on how tackling climate change can result in not only long-term benefits, but can also address health issues in the short term, said Drew Shindell, professor of climate sciences at Duke and lead author of the study.""Many people view climate change as a future problem, but our analysis shows that reducing emissions that cause warming -- many of which also contribute to air pollution -- would benefit public health here and now,"" he said in a statement.The health and economic benefits associated with easing global warming could sway people's priorities, Rachel Cleetus, lead economist and climate policy manager at the Union of Concerned Scientists, who was not involved in the study, told The Huffington Post on Tuesday.There are now ""very good here-and-now public health reasons to make the shift to cleaner energy,"" she said.Reducing carbon emissions -- especially from power plants and vehicles -- prevents other pollutants, such as sulfur oxides, mercury and lead, from spewing into the atmosphere. Shindell and his research team calculated how much emissions from these co-pollutants would decrease if the U.S. were to slash carbon emissions in the transportation and energy sectors by 75 and 63 percent, respectively. The researchers then calculated the number of premature deaths caused by those co-pollutants each year by looking at medical data documenting the links between chemical exposure and death. Using that data, researchers were able to figure out how many deaths from air pollution could be avoided under their emissions reduction scenarios. They found that cutting emissions from transportation by 75 percent could prevent up to 120,000 premature deaths by 2030. Reducing emissions from energy production by 63 percent could prevent up to 175,000 deaths over the same period. The researchers also found that preventing these early deaths would save the country around $250 billion in public health costs every year.

18,POLITICS,Rick Snyder Says He's Releasing All His Emails About The Flint Water Crisis,Tyler Tynes,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rick-snyder-release-all-emails_us_56ccb95ce4b0928f5a6d7b3d,It's not clear when the documents will be made public.,2016-02-23,Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) says he will release all staff emails pertaining to the Flint water crisis since 2011.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ccbbcc1500002b000b08d9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) says he will release all of his office's emails relating to the Flint water crisis since the start of his administration in 2011.Snyder's office told The Huffington Post on Tuesday that the governor has been working with his legal team sifting through documents for several weeks. There is no timetable for when the documents will be released.Along with the emails, Snyder's office says it also plans to make public material that has been requested under the Freedom of Information Act. ""These are unprecedented actions. By making this information easily accessible, everyone can review it,"" Laura Biehl, deputy press secretary to Snyder, told HuffPost in an emailed statement Tuesday. ""We know that this was a failure of government at all levels. Then we can all focus and work together on solutions, moving Flint forward and getting residents the assistance they need.""Biehl noted that Snyder has already released Flint-related emails from 2014 and 2015, along with more than 24,000 pages of emails from various Michigan state departments relevant to the Flint water crisis. In January, accompanying the release of the 2014 and 2015 Flint emails, Snyder wrote that he was making the documents public in the ""spirit of transparency and accountability.""Since 2014, residents of Flint -- an impoverished former industrial center that's almost 57 percent black -- have been drinking and bathing in toxic water. There's a widespread sense that the crisis is a product of environmental racism, since it has disproportionately affected the city's black community. Multiple members of Congress have urged Snyder in recent weeks to release more documents pertaining to the crisis.The governor's emergency managers were involved in a decision to temporarily use the Flint River as a main water source while a pipeline to Lake Huron was being constructed. That plan went into effect last April, resulting in contaminated drinking water for thousands of residents.Snyder had initially tried to shift responsibility away from his own administration, blaming Flint's city council for a 2013 vote to switch to the Karengodi Water Authority.Congressional hearings on Flint took place earlier this month, thanks in part to the urging of Rep. Brenda Lawrence (D-Mich.), a ranking member of the House Oversight Committee’s Subcommittee on the Interior. Snyder did not attend those hearings.Lawrence said this week that the people of Flint deserve the truth from the governor.“If the governor is truly committed to getting to the truth of the matter and the bottom of this man-made catastrophe there should be no hesitation in providing all the documentation requested,"" Lawrence told HuffPost in a statement on Tuesday.Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who with Lawrence has been persistent in demanding greater disclosures from Snyder's office, similarly urged the governor this week to be more forthcoming.""To date, Gov. Snyder has cherry-picked documents to disclose and shielded himself in redactions and FOIA exemptions, and as a result critical pieces of the record are still missing,"" Cummings said in a statement Tuesday. ""This is not how an open and transparent government acts. If Governor Snyder really wants to honor his promise of accountability, he would immediately provide all of the documents Congresswoman Lawrence and I have requested. Period.”Cummings argued on Monday that congressional Republicans are being soft on Snyder over the water catastrophe. The Congressional Black Caucus, of which Lawrence and Cummings are members, has announced plans to travel to Flint next month with Rep. Dan Kildee (D-Mich.), a native of the city.Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who chairs the House Oversight Committee, did not comment about the matter to HuffPost on Tuesday, but said he was looking forward to hearing Snyder testify before the committee in March. The date for that to happen has not been set.Kildee argued on Tuesday that Snyder's administration is ultimately responsible for the crisis in Flint, and that it needs to be transparent in its efforts to set things right.""It is clear that Governor Snyder's administration, including his state-appointed emergency financial managers, created this crisis,"" Kildee told HuffPost in an email. ""It's critical that the Governor be forthcoming with what he knows about the decisions that led to this terrible tragedy.""Also on HuffPost:"
19,POLITICS,Can You Sell Marijuana Pipes To Help Fund Bernie Sanders?,"Michael Beckel, Center for Public Integrity",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/can-you-sell-marijuana-pipes-to-help-fund-bernie-sanders_us_56cce5eae4b041136f18b4b6,Campaign finance experts clear the smoke.,2016-02-23,"Ceramic pipes touting Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders made by Ariel Zimman of Portland, Oregon.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56cce6ef1e00002200702a79.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ariel Zimman is taking a decidedly grassroots approach to supporting Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaign. But the legality of her handiwork is hazy, at best.The 29-year-old resident of Portland, Oregon, is marketing homemade ceramic pipes emblazoned with decals of Sanders’ head and campaign logo.Her pro-Sanders “smoking ware” — targeted at the “Burners for Bernie” set — sells for $60 apiece. And she advertises that 10 percent of her proceeds will benefit the self-described socialist from Vermont who has emerged as an unexpectedly serious challenger to Hillary Clinton for the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination.“It was really just a way to show my support for him as a candidate,” Zimman told the Center for Public Integrity. “People love [the pipes], and once they hear they are contributing in some way to the campaign, they are all about that too.”But artists like Zimman looking to make a buck off Bernie best beware: While most observers say political campaigns are unlikely to take legal action against their own supporters, attorneys say entrepreneurs open themselves to risk by using candidates’ names, likenesses or logos — especially when promising to donate a specific portion of their sales.“You can’t promise to pass the money along to the candidate,” said Joe Birkenstock, an attorney at Sandler Reiff who previously served as the chief counsel of the Democratic National Committee.“If I was advising one of these vendors, I would probably advise them to be a little less specific in their solicitation,” echoed Larry Noble, a former top lawyer for the Federal Election Commission who now works at the Campaign Legal Center.That’s a step that Sanders-supporting artist Jackie Dandelion of Beacon, New York, has already taken.Dandelion sells her “Another Mermaid for Bernie Sanders” bumper stickers for $8.50 apiece. She used to advertise that she’d donate 25 percent of each sale to Sanders. Now she simply notes that a portion of the proceeds — an unspecified figure greater than 25 percent — goes to his campaign.“Just know when you purchase from me, you're purchasing from someone who actively supports Bernie Sanders for president,” she wrote on the peer-to-peer e-commerce website Etsy.com.That website, and others like it, offer Bernie fans a number of imaginative ways to show their support, including pendants, makeup bags and candles.Other lawyers contacted by the Center for Public Integrity didn’t find these activities as troubling.Ken Gross, who leads the political law practice at Skadden Arps, noted that such artists are “actually doing good for the campaign,” even if the products they make are not licensed or authorized.“I can’t imagine the campaign going against them,” Gross said. “They’re supporters. They don’t want to turn them off.”Dan Backer, an attorney at DB Capitol Strategies, said pro-Sanders artists pledging to donate a portion of their profits are “attempting to entice sales from a target audience” and “are saying what they will do with their revenues,” not engaging in formal fundraising.“It only becomes a problem if they say they will forward the money — not the profits — to the campaign,” Backer continued. “If they specifically say ‘Give me $10, I will send $2 to the campaign in your name, and the other $8 will go towards this stuff,’ that’s a problem.”Like any donor, artists cannot exceed the $2,700 limit on political contributions to federal candidates. And donations must also be made from personal funds, not a corporate account — although some limited liability companies are allowed to give so long as the money is attributed to a living, breathing human being.Kenneth Pennington, Sanders’ digital director, told the Center for Public Integrity that the Sanders campaign doesn’t “authorize or condone” volunteer fundraising through the selling of products with the intent of passing along money to the campaign.He declined to comment on the specific examples raised by the Center for Public Integrity, although he noted that “it’s not okay to sell things with the campaign’s logo.”Zimman, the Portland-based pipe-maker, said she hasn’t heard one way or the other from Sanders’ campaign. But, she added, “If they need me to stop and they ask me to stop, I’ll stop.”To date, Zimman said she’s contributed about $150 to Sanders. She plans on donating another $200 within a month. That amounts to about $3,000 worth of pipe sales, she said.To hit the legal limit on how much she could donate to Sanders, she would need to sell about 400 more — likely a stretch for her one-woman operation.“There is profit on my side of the business, but I’m also doing it for their profit as well,” Zimman said.“It’s not a huge profit scheme that I’m working on,” she continued. “I would hope that Mr. Sanders would be like, ‘Yeah, you’re a small business, and you’re doing something that obviously is filling a need in the marketplace.'”This story is from the Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C."
20,POLITICS,Pro-Clinton Union Pressured Labor Official To Back Out Of Sanders Event,Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-labor-union_us_56ccbd11e4b0ec6725e432fd,"It's getting chippy out there, folks.",2016-02-23,A labor union threatened to pull funding from a group in Washington state if its head spoke at a rally for Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56ccbd7a1500002b000b08db.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Supporters of Bernie Sanders gathered at a union hall in Seattle for a ""Labor for Bernie"" rally Sunday. Early in the event, attendees were told that one speaker wouldn't be taking the podium as planned.Jeff Johnson, the head of the Washington State Labor Council, had been pressured not to speak at the Democratic presidential candidate's event, an emcee told the crowd. A major international labor union had threatened to pull funding from Johnson's group if he did, the emcee said. Johnson's group is affiliated with the AFL-CIO, the premiere labor federation in the U.S. The AFL-CIO has not yet endorsed anyone for president, and until it does so, state councils like Johnson's are expected to stay in line and not publicly back any particular candidates. Johnson easily could have rankled some unions -- ones backing Hillary Clinton, anyway -- by appearing at a Sanders powwow. The union that allegedly pressured Johnson went unnamed at the rally. Contacted by The Huffington Post, Johnson politely declined to take any questions on the matter. But labor sources familiar with the situation said the union was the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. AFSCME is one of the largest public-sector unions in the U.S. and a member of the AFL-CIO. As an individual union, it also happens to have endorsed Clinton for president back in October.Asked for comment on the situation in Seattle, AFSCME did not deny having intervened. A senior AFSCME official sent along the following statement:""As affiliates of the national federation, state labor federations are required to maintain a neutral position in presidential contests until an official endorsement is made by the national AFL-CIO. We expect all state federations to remain in compliance with this policy and where necessary we will exercise the option of withholding funding to ensure compliance with this rule.""AFSCME would be perfectly within its rights to make such a threat. That it might choose to do so speaks to some of the tension within organized labor over the race for the Democratic nomination. Just how much tension there is depends on whether you're speaking to a Clinton supporter or a Sanders one. Clinton has generally been running away with labor backing, having locked up endorsements from more than 20 unions representing a majority of unionized workers in the U.S. But three national unions and a number of locals have broken for Sanders, who's been a staunch supporter of collective bargaining throughout his years in Congress. And that's to say nothing of any rank-and-file enthusiasm for Sanders. Washington State, in particular, has been a hotbed for the pro-Bernie crowd in labor, according to the Sanders campaign. In a sign of just how scrambled the union politics are in 2016, AFSCME's own affiliate in Washington, the Washington Federation of State Employees, broke with the international and formally endorsed Sanders over Clinton, which was their right to do as a council.As HuffPost reported last week, the national AFL-CIO is shelving a presidential endorsement for the time being, probably because Clinton hasn't yet clinched enough formal backing from the federation's member unions. (It's rare for the AFL-CIO to endorse during a contested primary anyway.)The pro-Clinton unions, in turn, released a statement re-emphasizing their support for the former secretary of state, suggesting organized labor was unified behind her. ""[O]f all unions endorsing a candidate in the Democratic primary, the vast majority of the membership in these unions has endorsed her,"" they said.The stakes for labor are high in 2016. The ranks of unions continue to dwindle, and any Republican who takes the White House would probably be hostile to their interests. That's why many unions would be happy to see Clinton lock up the nomination as soon as possible and avoid a damaging and expensive primary.

This endorsement comes just before the Democratic South Carolina primary this weekend.In a radio ad that will begin running on Tuesday in the state, Lee calls on South Carolinians to ""Wake up"" and vote for Sanders.""I know and you know the system is rigged. For too long we've given our votes to corporate puppets,"" Lee says in the ad. ""Ninety-nine percent of Americans were hurt in the Great Recession of 2008 and many are still recovering."" That's why, Lee tells listeners, he's voting for Sanders who ""takes no money from corporations -- nada."" Lee goes on to recount some of the times Sanders has shown his loyalty to the progression of social justice, ""no flipping, no flopping.""""When Bernie gets into the White House he will do the right thing,"" Lee declares, referencing his 1989 film ""Do the Right Thing."" Lee's recent film ""Chi-raq,"" which was in cinemas this past December, explored race politics and the working class in Chicago.According to the Hill, Sanders' campaign denied telling reporters how much money was spent on the ad.Other influential African-American leaders and icons, like NAACP President Ben Jealous, Harry Belafonte, Cornel West and Ta-Nehisi Coates, have already publicly endorsed Sanders.African-Americans, who will make up more than half of the South Carolina voters turning out for the Democratic primaries according to the Guardian, are a crucial demographic for Sanders' campaign.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56cc84931e0000230070e8f3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's finally that time of year again... are you ready for the return of ""RuPaul's Drag Race""?The eighth season of the iconic reality show won't hit our living rooms until March 7, but the anticipation was already high last night in New York, where the season's 12 queens kicked off the show's premiere tour at Manhattan's Stage 48.We're being pretty legit when we say: we actually gagged over most of the queens this season. There are very few girls that seem to be ""filler"" queens, and the trajectory of the season could easily go a number of ways.But with three New York queens on season eight -- Thorgy Thor, Bob the Drag Queen and Acid Betty -- Stage 48 was packed to the brim last night with loyal fans and supporters.Before all 12 queens took to the stage, we had a chance to talk to a few of the girls about their own personal legacies, their experience on the show and ""Drag Race"" as an institution. Check out their answers and some photos of the event itself below.Happy ""Drag Race"" season!Kim Chi: Kim Chi is a live action anime character who works as a high fashion model. I'm heavily inspired by over-the-top anime drawings and over the top conceptual runways and I like to meld those two. It's really an honor to be part of this season because part of the reason I chose the name Kim Chi is [because] the queer Asian community is very underrepresented in American pop culture -- especially Koreans. So I wanted to pick a name that was as feminine as possible, but not feminine at the same time. In the future I hope we have [more diversity] like an Indian queen, some Mediterranean queens, some more Latin queens -- I want to see more variety. Thorgy Thor: I'll say this, and this is the first time I'm actually saying this to anybody, on the show I realized very quickly that the other girls were very efficient with their time. As a very, very ultra-creative person for years and years, I'm very good at taking my time alone and shutting out everything that I don't like and creating. And being thrown there, it was beyond anything I could've imagined as a nightmare for a creative person who is very specific -- meaning on the show it was depicted as, ""Oh, don't tell Thorgy, she's gonna cry about it,"" or ""don't tell Thorgy, she's gonna worry about it,"" because I was always running around like this worry wart. Which I didn't expect! But I really learned a lot about time management and like how I'm terrible at it, bad at asking for help because I'm very independent. Most people that live in New York, you can't depend on other people to get you anything -- you have to go cut in front of somebody, you gotta stab somebody to get that cab (laughs). So I learned that about myself.HuffPost Queer Voices previously interviewed Thorgy Thor for our series ""Queer New World"" -- head here to check it out.Dax ExclamationPoint: ""Drag Race"" has always made drag very, very accessible. People get interested in it that would never normally go to a drag show or look at a drag queen, and some are even like ""well now I want to be a drag queen!"" I remember a time not very long ago when there was like five or six of us in Atlanta (laughs). it was fun, but now people feel open to express themselves, especially when it comes to gender fluidity -- they're not afraid to. And I think that is what drag is doing for the world.Derrick Barry: I feel like I'm always going to have critics that say, ""He only does Britney,"" or ""He's always pretty' or ""He's always blonde,"" but hopefully they get to see something they like on the show. When I auditioned I wanted to be known in the way Chad Michaels is for Cher, and I wanted everyone to know that Britney is what I do. But I came out of it so differently -- because now I'm so excited for people to see everything else I'm doing. I'll always keep Britney a part of what I do but I feel like I did so much growing in the show while being around all of these inspiring people.Acid Betty: ""Drag Race"" has changed the drag scene at large completely. I was talking with Mimi Imfurst about how when we started doing drag there was no TV show. So we were actually breaking the rules and being ballsy [through our work] and getting treated like shit because of it. It really took a rockstar in us to be like, ""I'm a drag queen, I'm a freak, fight the power!"" Now, with ""RuPaul's Drag Race,"" every girl just wants to know how to get on the show -- there's not this [conversation about], ""Well, what does this drag character say about you?"" And how is this drag persona exposing an internal, vulnerable side about you Because I feel like me, Mimi, Lady Bunny, Bianca -- it's really a part of us.HuffPost Queer Voices previously interviewed Acid Betty for our series ""After Dark"" -- check it out here.Robbie Turner: I think drag is helping a lot of movements happening the same time. It's not scary -- drag queens aren't scary anymore, they're in your home. They're the gal pal that you want to go out with -- we're like the ultimate accessory. It's not like the drag queen of yesteryear where they were all underground in seedy nightclubs. Yeah, those clubs still exist but now it's much more of an approachable thing that somebody's mom would be like, ""Oh, drag isn't as scary as I thought it was.""""RuPaul's Drag Race"" season eight will premiere on Monday, March 7 at 9 p.m. ET/PT.

None of them are terrorism-related.The FBI and Apple have been embroiled in a very public battle over privacy and national security following a court order last week forcing the company to cooperate with the government to create a ""back door"" to the iPhone of Syed Rizwan Farook, one of the shooters in the San Bernardino massacre that killed 14 and wounded 22 on Dec. 2. Apple has vowed to fight the order.But the existence of these other cases appears to contradict FBI Director James Comey, who in a Sunday column disputed Apple's assertion that compliance in the San Bernardino case would set a dangerous precedent that would give the government greater leeway to undermine privacy more generally.""We simply want the chance, with a search warrant, to try to guess the terrorist's passcode without the phone essentially self-destructing and without it taking a decade to guess correctly. That's it,"" Comey wrote.The FBI did not return a request from comment from The Huffington Post.""The government suggests this tool could only be used once, on one phone. But that's simply not true,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook wrote last week on the company's site. ""Once created, the technique could be used over and over again, on any number of devices.""In response to the Apple letter unsealed Tuesday in New York, federal prosecutors, in their own rebuttal letter, told the judge that Apple has not been forthright about how it's cooperated with the government in past investigations.""Only more recently, in light of the public attention surrounding an All Writs Act order issued in connection with the investigation into the shootings in San Bernardino, California, has Apple indicated that it will seek judicial relief,"" the government lawyers wrote.Noting the law is on the government's side, the letter closes with this: ""Apple's position has been inconsistent at best."""

Since then, celebrities have stood by the ""Tik Tok"" singer online, including Lena Dunham who has shown her support in a powerful essay.As part of her feminist newsletter and site ""Lenny Letter"", the ""Girls"" creator wrote in a Lenny Letter released today that ""Sony could make this go away."" Instead, the company chose to minimize Kesha to her music and albums with no acknowledgement of the ""worth of her soul,"" Dunham wrote. By controlling her work, Sony also has a say in Kesha's finances. Aside from physical or verbal abuse, many domestic violence survivors face having little or no access to their finances at the hands of their partners, as Dunham pointed out.""When a woman is not in control of her financial destiny, either because her partner is the primary breadwinner or because he makes financial decisions for the entire family, her world is made minuscule,"" Dunham wrote. ""Her resources evaporate. Fear dominates.""Dunham also applauded the fans and performers who have stood by Kesha, especially other women. She noted that ""it wasn't that long ago"" that women felt like they couldn't speak up for one another, ""for fear of losing all they had worked so hard to create.""Those days are over.While her essay focuses on Kesha, Dunham wrote that the pop star's case is about much more than her career as an artist. Then in a single sentence, Dunham summed up the real message the outcome of Kesha's case reveals.""What's happening to Kesha highlights the way that the American legal system continues to hurt women by failing to protect them from the men they identify as their abusers.""Read Dunham's essay in full over on Lenny.Also on HuffPost:"

The matriarch of The Muppets has been a bona fide superstar since she took Hollywood by storm in the '70s.These days she's been busy filming ABC's ""The Muppets,"" which chronicles her soaring career as the host of the talk show ""Up Late with Miss Piggy."" And when she's not chit-chatting with A-list celebrities, she's acting as a muse to a host of fashion designers like Marc Jacobs, Zac Posen and Christian Louboutin. And although Miss Piggy is sadly no longer romantically involved with Kermit (fingers crossed they get back together soon), her single status hasn't affected her awesomeness. There is just a je ne sais quoi about this pig that we can't get enough of. We caught up with Miss Piggy to chat about her personal style, why getting a full night's sleep is so important and how to take the perfect selfie. HuffPost: Where do you shop for clothes that flatter your body shape?  Miss Piggy: I mostly work with designers who create clothes especially for moi. But when I do go shopping, the staff always knows that if they want to sell me anything they had better start flattering me and my body shape the moment I walk in the store.Who are your favorite designers?Oh, I adore -- and I’m creative muse -- to so many designers! There’s Vivienne Westwood, Zac Posen, Marc Jacobs, Christian Louboutin, Jeremy Scott, Jason Wu, to name just a few who’ve been inspired by moi. And I’m especially fond of a brand new designer whom I’ve just discovered. His name is Uncle Deadly, and he’s my wardrobe supervisor/dresser on “Up Late with Miss Piggy."" He’s planning to launch his own line of haute couture -- Uncle By Deadly. Trust moi, it’s the next big thing! What word of advice would you give to women who are not as confident as you are when getting dressed?Love yourself. Naturally, I have it easy because I have me to love. But you’re pretty good too. I know you work hard to be the best possible you; if someone doesn’t appreciate that, who needs them? As it says in the song: “The greatest love of all / Is easy to achieve / Learning to love yourself / Is the greatest love of all” (FYI: I also believe “the children are our future” but since that has nothing to do with your question, I left that part of the song out.) What has been your favorite red carpet moment?Well, I learned so much about the red carpet from my dear friend, the late Joan Rivers! She was fearless. And so, I dedicate my favorite red carpet moment to her. Recently I was at a major awards show. Who can remember which? All I recall is that it involved statues, stars and endless speeches. And as I was strutting and posing, the unthinkable happened: my dress ripped and my derriere was visible. At first I was devastated, but then I thought WWJRD (What Would Joan Rivers Do) -- and I decided to embrace the moment and make it work! The result: #UnveilTheTail. What are your thoughts about contouring? I love contouring. I’ve always believed in highlighting my best features by any means possible. Since I have so many “best” features, it can be difficult to decide which to highlight. But it’s well worth the effort -- especially if, like moi, you have your own team of stylists, make-up artists and special effects experts. Do you wear fake lashes, or are those your natural ones?There is nothing natural about any part of me, especially my lashes. Everything’s been remodeled, reconditioned, upgraded and embellished.  How do you figure out how to style your hair, especially considering your pronounced ears?I’m not sure what you mean by “pronounced” ears? If you mean “perfect,"" then I couldn’t agree more. But if that’s some kind of code for “honking big ears”…well! How’d you like your hair styled with a weedwacker? … Oh, you meant “perfect”! I thought so. How do I style it? I have no idea. I wake up, my beauty team surrounds me and about an hour later -- voila, it’s moi!Sleep is so important. How much beauty sleep to you get every night?I get 12 hours of sleep during the night, and then take a one-hour nap just before I go on stage for “Up Late with Miss Piggy."" And if my guest is boring, I sometimes catch a few winks while they’re jabbering away.Any must-have beauty products?There is only one must-have beauty product: a mirror. Everything else is just smoke, mirrors and spackle.When do you feel the most beautiful?At night. When there is full moon outside and I’m perfectly backlit by klieg lights and a couple of baby spotlights. When you’re a star, you leave nothing to chance. Finally -- you're a selfie queen! What's the key to taking the perfect selfie? Teach us your ways.Make sure I’m in it. And, of course, use a professional photographer. I’ve got the fabulous Annie Leibovitz on a retainer to take all my selfies. What that girl can do with a cell phone and a selfie-stick is breathtaking!Also on HuffPost: "

The complex was the first of three locations hit by alleged shooter Jason B. Dalton. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56cbea3b1e0000230070e895.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"KALAMAZOO, Mich. -- Accused killer Jason B. Dalton may have used two vehicles to carry out his weekend shooting rampage that killed six people and severely injured two, police said. Dalton, a 45-year-old Uber driver, opened fire at three locations on Saturday in a frenzy of violence that authorities said had no apparent pattern. Witnesses described the same shooter at each crime scene, but two different vehicles. A witness to the first burst of gunfire saw Dalton driving a silver SUV, Kalamazoo County Sheriff's Detective Sgt. William Sparrow testified during Dalton's arraignment Monday.""Further witnesses indicated the vehicle to be an Equinox or Traverse” SUV, Sparrow said. He said Dalton sideswiped another vehicle fleeing the Meadows development of townhouses on the eastern edge of Kalamazoo County -- the scene of the first shooting. Police later determined it was a silver Chevy Equinox. More than four hours later, when the gunman killed a man and his teenage son at a Kalamazoo Kia dealership, roughly a mile from the Western Michigan University campus, surveillance video showed him driving a ""dark-colored Chevrolet HHR,"" according to Kalamazoo Public Safety Detective Cory Ghiringhelli. A vehicle matching that description was seen at the Cracker Barrel restaurant less than 20 minutes later, where four women were shot to death and a 14-year-old girl was critically injured, authorities said. Dalton was arrested early Sunday, after a sheriff's deputy spotted a black Chevy HHR leaving the parking lot of a downtown Kalamazoo bar. Ghiringhelli said. Dalton had a semi-automatic handgun in the vehicle, but was taken into custody without incident.Uber passengers said Dalton picked up fares on Saturday before the shootings and between movements to new targets.About an hour before the shootings, Uber passenger Matt Mellen called police to report Dalton was driving erratically, according to WWMT Channel 3. Mellen told authorities Dalton was driving a silver Equinox and had a dog in the back. A neighbor named Jamie, who did not want to give her last name due to privacy reasons, lives in the Meadows development of townhouses, told The Huffington Post Monday she ran outside after hearing multiple shots in front of her home. She said her son, watching from a window, saw the gunman speed away in a dented silver SUV -- with a dog in the back. Jamie said she found her neighbor, Tiana Carruthers, lying on the ground with three gunshot wounds, in the leg and arm. Jamie said she tried to calm Carruthers as they awaited help and listened to her neighbor's account of what had happened. Jamie said Carruthers told her the shooter asked if her name was Maise before driving away and returning to shoot her. ""I thought it was a hit job or something,"" she said, noting another neighbor approached to the scene to tell police he had been watching her outside her apartment. The row of townhouses where Carruthers was shot is tucked deep inside the sprawling complex of winding streets and cul-de-sacs. Jamie said her neighbor described to police the shooter's eyes and hair color -- and the silver Chevy SUV. Carruthers also picked Dalton out of a lineup, detectives said. Jamie on Monday pointed to skid marks on the pavement she said the gunman left while making his getaway. They were framed by bright orange paint police used to mark the location of shell casings. During a special Mass for the victims on Sunday, the mother of one of Dalton's longtime friends expressed shock. ""I couldn't believe it,"" Dolores Axe tearfully told The Huffington Post, noting she's known him since he was a teenager. Dalton was charged Monday with six counts of murder, two counts of attempted murder and eight weapons charges. Michigan doesn't have a death penalty, so he faces life in prison if convicted. "
