(Sorry, Princess Charlotte.)But in order to provide the First Family of Cuteness some peace and quiet, the zoo's panda habitat has been closed since August, depriving eager fans of a good look at the young cub.Thankfully, keeper Marty Dearie wrote in December that Bei Bei had ""grown exponentially over the last few months"" -- weighing an impressive 16 pounds as of Dec. 7 -- which means the 5-month-old is finally ready to make his public debut on Jan. 16. And from the looks of it, he's a natural:Pandas have a notoriously difficult time reproducing, which is one reason for the animals' endangered status. Bei Bei and a twin brother, who died shortly after birth, were the result of artificial insemination. Bei Bei's parents, Tian Tian and Mei Xiang, also live at the zoo with their 2-year-old daughter Bao Bao, also the result of artificial insemination. Bei Bei, who was born Aug. 22, is now thriving, which marks a huge success for the zoo -- and a victory for anyone with a soul: The zoo has been introducing the baby cub to crowds incrementally, including a Jan. 7 checkup that was open to lucky members of the press. And it's no surprise the little star is ready for the spotlight. In December, Bei Bei showed the world just how chill he is by snoozing through his media debut. His DGAF attitude was so strong, he even left tiny drool stains on the table:Today, Bei Bei is bigger than either of his older siblings were at his age. (His 10-year-old brother, Tai Shan, now lives in China.)According to the zoo's periodic Giant Panda Bulletin (what a time to be alive), the young cub spends most of his time sleeping, nursing or learning how to walk. And his chubby baby face is just too much to handle: Judging by his older sister -- whom keeper Nicole MacCorkle and biologist Laurie Thompson described as ""a playful adolescent"" in a December update -- Bei Bei is probably only going to get cuter. Just check out Bao Bao on her first birthday:When it comes to the inevitable cuteness overload, we're just going to have to grin and bear it.Also on HuffPost: "

Lady Gaga and her fiancé, Taylor Kinney, appear nude on the cover of V magazine's spring preview issue, giving us a glimpse of their not-so-bad romance. The pic -- a mirror selfie -- shows the couple in a close embrace sitting atop an art canvas, their bodies smeared with paint.The cover is one of 16 for the issue, which was guest-edited by the singer herself. Another one of the covers features the couple's French bulldog, Asia.The 29-year-old singer (real name Stefani Germanotta) and Kinney, 34, got engaged on Valentine's Day last year. Gaga revealed the news by sharing a photo of her gigantic heart-shaped ring on Instagram. ""He gave me his heart on Valentine's Day, and I said YES!"" she captioned the pic. The pair met in 2011 while filming Gaga's ""You & I"" music video, in which Kinney stars as a shirtless mad scientist (or... something) who gets it on with a mermaid Gaga. The video is full of what now looks like foreshadowing, including a scene in which Gaga -- wearing her mother's wedding dress -- accepts a ring from Kinney. Whoa. V99 hits newsstands on Jan. 14.

""They didn't care and it was all we could do to get them to do anything. We couldn't even get the television stations to report it.""Mitchell's 16-year-old daughter and her best friend, also 16, disappeared on Wednesday. They were last seen getting into a vehicle outside Lafayette High School.Contacted by HuffPost on Friday morning, a spokesperson for the Lafayette Police Department confirmed officials had not launched a missing person investigation.""We're not listing them as missing,"" said Sgt. Kyle Soriez, who appeared confused that HuffPost was interested in reporting the story. ""In fact, our local media hasn't even covered them as missing. I believe one of the local media outlets has them just on their social network page just as an assistance to the parents, but currently they're runaways.""Natalie Wilson, co-founder and director of public relations for Black and Missing Foundation, Inc., said it endangers missing children when police simply label them as runaways, because investigators typically don't put the same amount of effort into locating them.""A large number of children who run away end up being victims of sex trafficking,"" Wilson told HuffPost. ""And when they are classified as runaways, they don't receive an amber alert or any media attention at all, which is what we saw in this case.""Mitchell said it was out of character for his daughter, whom he described as a good student with ""great character and attitude,"" to be out of contact with his family.""Just like any kid, you get rebellious spurts, but nothing like this,"" he said. ""So we was upset when the police officer yesterday told us that there would have to be no contact within 48 hours for them to actually deal with this as a missing person.""Fortunately, Mitchell's family did not have to wait for that classification. Both girls were found safe Friday afternoon, after HuffPost spoke with police. Calls for comment to police following their safe recovery were not returned.While there was a happy ending to the story -- in the sense that both girls are home safe -- Mitchell credits grassroots efforts and social media with getting the ball rolling on the case.""After [the police] saw the posts on social media, they said, 'Well, I guess since you all done put it out there with this negative vibe, we're going to assign a detective to the case,'"" Mitchell said. ""Within two hours they found our daughter. We couldn't of done that without social media and you guys.""Kelly Murphy, president and founder of the Omaha, Nebraska-based nonprofit missing person assistance group Project Jason, said it is not uncommon to hear families of the missing complain of what they feel is a lack of sensitivity by law enforcement agencies.""For the families, when you don't know where your loved one is, it's a critical and frightening experience,"" Murphy told HuffPost. ""I don't care whether they are kidnapped or a runaway; they are still missing and may be in danger. The bottom line is you don't know where they are or if they are safe.""Project Jason offers resources to families of the missing and has successfully organized grassroots efforts to pass missing-persons legislation.Murphy started Project Jason after her son, Jason Jolkowski (pictured below), disappeared in June 2001. He remains missing today.""I think a lot of it is a numbers thing, especially in a large metropolitan area,"" Murphy said of how police often react when teenagers go missing. ""On any given day, a large city can have dozens of runaways and some are a revolving door, so I can understand how they can be desensitized to numbers, but that still does not excuse not being sensitive to a family who is frightened and doesn't know where their loved one is.""Mitchell said he is not angry with any one person in particular, but is disturbed by what he perceives as a lack of effort and empathy by police while the girls were missing.""I'm glad they're safe and what not, but this is not dead for me,"" the father said. ""The things we had to deal with the last two days -- that kind of behavior needs to be silenced. All cases need to be looked into.""Wilson agrees.""Law enforcement is supposed to be there as a vehicle to help families find their missing loved ones and to be just callous or just not take the case seriously is a disservice to the citizens,"" she said. ""And it's not just happening in Lafayette, it's happening across the country."""

Abstract background with binary code.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5d044260000360082cc84.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale," By Stella Mikhailova, MSc in Sustainability and Management, University of BathFlorian Ramseger is a product specialist at software company Tableau. This year he came to the World Resources Forum, an international conference that takes place annually in Davos, Switzerland, and brings together people with a mission from research institutes, think tanks and universities, as well as policymakers and businessmen.Standing in front of the audience at his master class titled ""Telling Your Story Through Data,"" he shared an anecdotal story from his past as an economist. Once he tried to build a linear regression model using data, but none of his attempts to fit the data into a good model were successful. When nothing worked, he went to the people from the statistics department and showed them his data. In response, he received a question: ""Why do you fit your data into a linear model if there is clearly nonlinear correlation?""Looking at the data is crucial for researchers, Ramseger said. However it is not the only problem that we have with data now. Participants in the master class agreed that they often experience difficulties in communicating their research outcomes to the public. They find it especially hard to communicate results to the nonscientific community.Fortunately, data journalism provides useful tools that researchers can use to examine their data and communicate the results in a digestible manner. Here are the main tips researchers should follow to succeed:1. Your data should tell a story.Every story has three major parts: context, struggle and resolution.Context should make readers familiar with the concepts and objects that you are researching. Here, researchers should try to link new information to existing knowledge. One way to do this is to use infographics to set up the context, as in a Süddeutsche Zeitung article (see below) that visualizes the difference between the number of delegates at a G-7 meeting and the number of policemen involved in the event as the reader scrolls through. The article first sets up seven figures representing the G-7 delegates and then compares them to the number of policemen. http://gfx.sueddeutsche.de/politik/2015-06-03_G7-Gipfel_Schloss_ElmauVisual context usually works for simple and well-known objects. In a more complicated context, textual introduction will work well.2. Make the struggle in your story easy to understand.In the struggle part, researchers should illustrate the differences and contrasts in their data. Data visualization serves as a great tool to clarify and highlight these differences. Following are some useful tips.First, try to use horizontal bar charts to illustrate differences in data. They are much easier to understand than, say, pie charts, as the latter require readers to make more complicated visual comparisons, such as those between the angles of the pie's various sections. The second key element here is to always choose horizontal over vertical headers, as readers should not need to rotate their head at a 90-degree angle to read it. And finally, do not forget to use different colors for readers to understand the differences between each bar.Second, do not be afraid to show differences in differences.A good way to do this is to present two lines of data showing different trends, and leave a space between the lines to make it easier for users to focus on the gap between them, as in the example below. Using different colors together, leaving space between the lines, simplifies the process of seeing and grasping the differences in the data. But do not go too far into it, and do not overload the graphic with too much information, even if it looks pretty.  http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/02/us/oregon-shooting-terrorism-gun-violenceThird, do not be afraid to show difference in differences in differences.But do not use 3-D for that. 3-D maps are very complicated to follow and understand. One solution may be to provide small illustrative graphs for each time period next to each other. This helps readers see trends over days, weeks and years. Using colors is still very helpful to illustrate the differences from Point 1 within each of the small pictures. https://public.tableau.com/s/gallery/boris-bikes-daily-usage 3. Ask yourself: What do you want the reader to take away?Once this question is answered, make it the resolution of the story. Do not leave the reader without some culmination, as otherwise your information will look just like raw data and will not leave a message.Just telling a fact or showing the picture is not enough to create good data visualization. ""For me, good visualizations are not necessarily the ones that are the most pretty and not those that use correct tools, though it helps,"" Ramseger said. ""The really good ones are those that touch you and tell you the story.""The example below, illustrating gun-related murders in the U.S., is not a scientific piece, but it clearly sets up the context, shows the differences and leaves a final message that readers should take with them.4. Something to bear in mind about data journalismKeep in mind that in some cases, it may be dangerous to rely too much on infographics. ""If we are going to start reducing the word counting in the article and only use infographics, we are going to lose the big picture,"" says Jocelyn Blériot of the Ellen MacArthur Foundation. To avoid this, each infographic should be combined with a thoroughly researched story, he adds.Another problem with data journalism is that sometimes people still have a hard time understanding the visual part. Claude Fussler of the CO Forum said that in his village in France, many people do not look at data visualizations because their education level does not allow them to understand infographics easily. This is another reason why researchers should be careful when selecting data visualization tools and should prefer those that simplify the understanding of data, such as the ones mentioned here.After all, ""if you do it right, you can use it for any topic--except, maybe, love,"" Ramseger said, laughing.This story was originally published on projourno.org.

Aaron Zintner writes recent polls show that while women favor President Obama's performance overall, 64% disapprove of how Obama is handling terrorism. And women worry more: we worry more than men that someone we love will be a victim of a terrorist attack.From Soccer Moms to Joe the Plumber, we embrace a neat moniker for an electoral trend. But the return of the Security Mom is, like much fear over terrorism, a red herring to the most present threat to American mothers' security: gun violence.Do I need to quote the statistics? I will, although I fear we are numb to them.- Women are 16 times as likely to be killed by a male acquaintance than by a male stranger. - 2694 children and teens died from guns in 2010. That's a roughly equivalent to a Newtown massacre every three days.- Between 1979 and 2010, more children and teens died from guns than U.S. soldiers in the wars in Vietnam, Korea, Iraq and Afghanistan combined.- In a study of 23 high-income nations, 87 percent of children under age 15 killed by guns lived in the United States. - The gun homicide rate for teens and young adults in the U.S. ages 15-24 was 42.7 higher than in the other high-income countries combined.*I'm not dismissing the very real fear of terrorism we face. But given the fact that there are more guns than people in the United States, what's the common thread? Gun violence.Mothers from every corner of the US fear their loved ones getting shot and killed. How can we communicate this strongly enough to the Presidential candidates, and diminish the distraction of the ""Security Mom""?It's tempting to get distracted from the fact that domestic terrorist violence is still gun violence. The GOP candidates want to ignore talking about gun violence and refocus us on a fear we cannot control.Tell the candidates you are a #guncontrolmom. Tell everyone. It's scary to talk about gun control. It's scary to ask playdates and your kids friends' parents if they have guns at home. I'm anxious even writing these words.Support SandyHookPromise.org an organization doing trainings in schools and towns to prevent gun violenceVisit MomsDemandAction.org. Thank President Obama for his executive action on gun control- but remind the next round of elected officials it is not enough. * Thanks to Futures Without Violence for the stats"

(The interview with Gordon begins at 22:00.)Slay started with Rams owner Stan Kroenke's suggestion that he and the franchise have made significant efforts to reach an agreement for a new stadium in St. Louis.Kroenke's most noteworthy claims in the proposal, though, were about the city's economy, which he said ""ranks 490 out of 515 U.S. cities and 61st among the 64 largest U.S. cities in economic growth in recent years,"" according to one study.That drew Slay's strongest rebuke.“Far from being ‘struggling’ compared to other US cities, St. Louis is experiencing an entrepreneurial renaissance, ranking first in the world for growth in tech venture capital investment between 2013 and 2014 and being named #1 out of 14 Best Startup Cities in America by Popular Mechanics in 2015,"" Slay wrote.""In important demographic categories, St. Louis compares favorably to Denver, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, and Tampa Bay -- all cities that support three professional teams,"" Slay continued, taking exception to Kroenke's claim that the city is not a large enough market to host three pro sports teams.Kroenke is still hoping to persuade NFL owners that his team -- not the San Diego Chargers or Oakland Raiders, who have also filed relocation proposals -- should win the Los Angeles sweepstakes. Slay's letter, meanwhile, comes a day after those owners met in New York to discuss the dueling relocation attempts.""While I remain extremely unhappy at the portrayal of St. Louis in the Rams' relocation submission, I am hopeful -- if not confident -- that the NFL will do the right thing,"" Slay concludes.Nothing is final yet, but that lack of confidence seems warranted given that Kroenke and Goodell have so far scoffed at the city and state's proposal to put more than $450 million in public tax money toward a new stadium on the banks of the Mississippi River.Read the full letter:"

Luis Gutiérrez (D-Ill.) joins immigrant advocates in front of the White House on Friday to criticize deportation raids.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5690295b170000420056713b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The White House plans to stay the course on its policies toward undocumented mothers and children fleeing violence in Central America, even as Democrats say its deportation raids are putting families in jeopardy.""We're of course aware of these concerns, but the enforcement strategy and priorities that the administration has articulated are not going to change,"" Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Friday -- a day after administration officials attended a meeting with House Democrats, and the same day activists held a press conference condemning the raids outside the White House. The Department of Homeland Security began raids last weekend targeting families that entered the U.S. after May 1, 2014, and received deportation orders. During the first few days of the raids, the agency picked up 121 people, all of whom had exhausted their legal remedies to stay in the U.S., DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson said on Monday.The people officials picked up represent only a small portion of the tens of thousands of Central American women and children apprehended along the U.S.-Mexico border during a surge in 2014. Apprehensions of families and unaccompanied minors are climbing again. Many conservatives say this is due to what they consider to be the Obama administration's lax immigration enforcement.But experts say it's more likely driven by dangerous conditions, including gang violence, in Central America -- which is why Democratic lawmakers and advocates say it's unconscionable to send families back to the countries they're fleeing.Earnest noted, however, that the families fit into the administration's stated priorities for deportation, along with convicted criminals and others considered a potential threat to public safety, due to their status as relatively recent arrivals.""We are seeking to deport felons, not break apart families,"" Earnest said Friday in defense of the deportation priorities. ""The other area of priority that is important is to ensure that we are maintaining security at the border, and that means individuals who have only recently crossed the border are also priorities for removal.""But Democratic critics and immigration activists are throwing the oft-used ""felons, not families"" line back at the administration, and asking why women and children are being targeted in their homes.""The president said we were going to focus on felons, not families,"" said House Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), who had previously echoed some of the administration's points on the raids, during a press conference condemning them on Friday.""Everybody understands focusing on felons. But focusing on families is not reflective of our values,"" Hoyer continued.Hoyer joined members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus and Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) at the press conference, where they railed against the Obama administration for looking at the mothers and children as an immigration issue rather than a refugee issue.Congressional Hispanic Caucus Chairwoman Linda Sánchez (D-Calif.) acknowledged that because the families entered the country in 2014 or after, they are technically a priority for removal. But she said that they are also candidates for relief to remain in the U.S., given the dangers they would face in their home countries.Sánchez and others are calling for the administration to offer the Central American families temporary protected status, and requested a meeting with Obama to discuss it personally. The lawmakers are also circulating a letter to the president that they will send next week.The administration can designate certain countries as unsafe, and people from those countries can apply for temporary protected status to remain in the U.S. on a provisional basis. El Salvador and Honduras are currently among the countries designated for temporary protected status, but the Salvadoran and Honduran women and children picked up in the recent raids are ineligible for protection because they entered the U.S. too recently.""Under extraordinary circumstances -- and I would think that facing almost certain death is an extraordinary circumstance if you're removed from this country -- I would think that the president has the authority to grant temporary protected status to those families,"" Sánchez said.She and other Democrats said the women have not had an adequate opportunity to make their case for remaining in the country. But an immigration court granted stays of removal to at least four families picked up in the raids earlier this week, after they filed late appeals. Attorneys said some of the women did not appeal their deportation ruling within the required window of time because they couldn't afford legal counsel or didn't understand the proceedings.Earnest told reporters on Friday that all cases are ""considered on a case-by-case basis for any sort of humanitarian or asylum claims they may have to make, and their legal remedies are exhausted before they are deported.""Also on HuffPost:"

""Governor Bush’s empowerment agenda for the 21st century will end wasteful welfare programs, give power and money back to the states and empower recipients by focusing on work and families,"" the Bush campaign said in a plan posted on its website Friday. ""His plan will create a safety net that protects hardworking Americans when they fall but no longer traps families in perpetual dependence.""Bush's plan is similar to what House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has proposed in recent years -- getting rid of federal programs and letting states have the money and decide how to use it to help the poor.The $78 billion Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides monthly food assistance to 45 million Americans, is the largest of the several in Bush's crosshairs. His plan notes that the program requires that able-bodied recipients without dependents are supposed to work if they want to receive benefits, but that in 2015 most states waived the requirement. ""These waivers help explain why only 16 percent of the 4.5 million households with able-bodied adults without dependents receiving assistance report any earnings,"" the plan says. One quibble with this is that almost all of the waivers are expiring this year thanks to federal law and a falling unemployment rate. The Obama administration notified states in 2015 that they'd be losing their waiver authority, and some states have been eager to show it the door. Another quibble is that the overall percentage of SNAP recipients earning money from work has increased over the years, as the White House noted in a December report. The Bush campaign says his proposed ""Right to Rise"" grants would be comparable in dollar amount to what state residents currently receive from federal programs, meaning he wouldn't necessarily be cutting benefits immediately. The block grant structure, however, is usually designed to remain fixed, so benefits would effectively decline over time. Bush also favors expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit -- one of the country's biggest antipoverty policies -- an idea that has bipartisan appeal. "

The company, which also makes Pepperidge Farm cookies and Prego pasta sauces, said it would withdraw from all efforts by groups opposing such measures.Several activist groups have been pressuring food companies to be more transparent about the use of ingredients, especially GMO-derived ones, as questions are being raised on their effects on health and the environment.Several big companies such as Monsanto Co, PepsiCo Inc and Kellogg Co have resisted such calls and have spent millions of dollars to defeat GMO-labeling ballot measures in states such as Oregon, Colorado, Washington and California, saying it would add unnecessary costs.In 2014, Vermont became the first U.S. state to pass a law requiring food companies to label GMOs on their products, which will come into effect in July.Campbell said late on Thursday that if a federal solution has not been achieved in some time, it was prepared to label all of its U.S. products for the presence of ingredients that were derived from GMOs and would seek guidance from the FDA and approval by USDA.Campbell said in July that it would stop adding monosodium glutamate (MSG) to its condensed soups for children and use non-genetically modified ingredients sourced from American organic farms in its Campbell's organic soup line for kids.The company also said it would remove artificial colors and flavors from nearly all of its North American products by July 2018.Also on HuffPost:"

This spending would not just cover electoral, lobbying and other political expenses, but also Koch’s gifts to universities so they'll teach curriculum adhering to his libertarian economic philosophy and to like-minded nonprofit think tanks influencing and expanding policy debates.Despite all this promised spending, both Charles and David Koch have declined to endorse a candidate in the primary -- which may be why they lack influence. Their refusal to endorse stems from a desire to save resources for the general election and avoid adding fuel to an internecine conflict within the party they most closely identify with. But, as Koch reveals in his comments to the Financial Times, he veers far from Republican orthodoxy on some basic policy questions -- notably, foreign policy.In his own statements, Koch has always adhered to a common libertarian position of non-intervention. He criticized the 2003 invasion and occupation of Iraq under President George W. Bush, which was backed by congressional majorities in both parties at the time. And now, he is criticizing Republicans for their belligerence towards Muslims and a certain GOP candidate's short-sightedness for proposing to carpet-bomb land held by terrorist groups.“We have been doing this for a dozen years,” he said. “We invaded Afghanistan. We invaded Iraq. Has that made us safer? Has that made the world safer? It seems like we’re more worried about it now than we were then, so we need to examine these strategies.”The 80-year old Koch also blasted fellow billionaire and Republican front-runner Donald Trump’s call to block Muslims from entering the U.S. for an indefinite period of time.“Well, then you destroy our free society,” he said of Trump’s plan. “Who is it that said, ‘If you want to defend your liberty, the first thing you’ve got to do is defend the liberty of people you like the least’?”As for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s announced desire to carpet-bomb all territory held by the so-called Islamic State group in Syria and Iraq, Koch dipped into his studies of revolutionary movements for an answer.“Mao said that the people are the sea in which the revolutionary swims,” he said. “Not that we don’t need to defend ourselves and have better intelligence and all that, but how do we create an unfriendly sea for the terrorists in the Muslim communities? We haven’t done a good job of that.”With 1.6 billion Muslims worldwide, he asked, “What are we going to do: go bomb each one of them?”Given his policy positions, it's no surprise that Koch has declined to endorse a Republican nominee. The only candidate who comes close to sharing these opinions is Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who sits at the back of the pack of GOP candidates in almost all available state polls. A lack of endorsement, or even the possibility of one, neuters Koch’s influence in the primary race.In the end, of course, Koch and his vast political apparatus will spend hundreds of millions to support Republican Party politicians up and down the ballot -- including the eventual Republican nominee, who will undoubtedly be someone who wants to increase bombing in Syria and Iraq, withdraw from diplomacy with Iran and continue to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia to use in its brutal war in Yemen. (The eventual Democratic Party nominee may be only slightly different, save for that candidate's position on Iran.)Clearly, Koch’s near-total opposition to government involvement in economic affairs trumps his opposition to carpet-bombing the Middle East and discriminating against Muslim Americans.Also on HuffPost:"

That day, Dewitt, who had worked for the Arkansas prison system for 15 years, was named Employee of the Year.Yet at that very same time, according to allegations contained in court documents, Dewitt was sexually assaulting three female inmates at McPherson Unit, the women’s prison where he worked. He would continue to prey on women under his control, prosecutors claim, until he resigned in 2014.On Dec. 17, 2015, Dewitt was charged with 50 counts of third-degree sexual assault relating to three female inmates. He is currently being held in the Jackson County jail.Three women testified to state police that Dewitt repeatedly sexually assaulted them after they became involved in the faith-based program he began at McPherson Unit, called Principles and Applications for Life.Under Arkansas law, members of the clergy and employees of correctional facilities are prohibited from engaging in sexual contact with inmates. Dewitt was both at the time the alleged assaults occurred.One woman told police that Dewitt had a schedule for the assaults. One inmate would report to his office on Sunday morning, she said, another on Monday morning and another on Wednesday. All three women described similar details about how the assaults took place.The Justice Department has also opened an investigation into McPherson Unit, due to multiple allegations of sexual abuse by staff members. Dewitt's attorney, Jeff Rosenzweig, told The Huffington Post that his client plans to plead not guilty.The award that Dewitt won was reported in The Advocate, a publication for employees of the Arkansas Department of Correction. The spokeswoman for the department, Cathy Frye, said that staff members nominate their colleagues for the awards. The nominations are then voted on by the Arkansas Department of Correction's management team.Melissa Jeltsen covers domestic violence and other issues related to women's health, safety and security.

President Barack Obama has kicked off 2016 by issuing a new set of executive actions intended to address gun violence. But it's an open question as to how effective and lasting any of these orders will be.As our own Jonathan Cohn notes, Obama's moves may not be felt in the present moment at all. Rather, they'd set the stage for future policies.Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who's forcefully declared congressional inaction on guns to be a clear and present danger, says Obama's actions offer him some hope -- especially those designed to get more sellers participating in background checks. ""Because there's been a culture ... of non-enforcement ... there are lots and lots of sellers that aren't doing background checks that probably should,"" he says.With Obama's order bringing new ""legal exposure,"" Murphy thinks that ""tens if not hundreds of thousands of guns"" will now be subject to the background checks. ""When you get into that kind of scope,"" he says, ""that saves lives.""Meanwhile, out on the 2016 campaign trail, Democratic hopeful Hillary Clinton has launched some hot broadsides against rival Bernie Sanders' Wall Street policies.Which is actually pretty strange, considering it's not a vulnerable issue for Sanders. In fact, it's Clinton who suffers by comparison. But for some reason she wants that fight, despite her significant lead on Sanders in most of the recent polls. Why make these attacks at all? We'll try to figure it out.Finally, 2016 could be a troublesome year for food stamp beneficiaries, as lawmakers' desire to kick people out of the program continues to run a few miles ahead of the economic recovery. Hundreds of thousands of Americans now face a new year of unexpected and unnecessary food insecurity. We'll talk with one person affected by the coming changes.""So, That Happened"" is hosted by Jason Linkins, Zach Carter and Arthur Delaney. Joining them this week is Sen.

24,POLITICS,Hillary Clinton Sets Up A Fight With Bernie Sanders Over Paid Leave,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-paid-leave_us_568f2e27e4b0a2b6fb6f8d81,"But the real contrast is with Republicans, who oppose paid leave guarantees altogether.",2016-01-08,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7e4ec1d00003000143032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Thursday offered new details about her plan to make sure all workers can take time off, with pay, in order to care for a newborn or sick relative.In so doing, she drew two contrasts -- a small one with Democratic rival Bernie Sanders, who would finance his own paid leave proposal differently, and a big one with the Republican presidential candidates, who wouldn’t guarantee paid leave at all.Under Clinton’s plan, any worker could take up to 12 weeks off from work to play the role of family caregiver or to recover from an injury or illness. During that time, the worker would be eligible to receive replacement wages, up to two-thirds of his or her salary. The Clinton campaign didn’t provide many details on the formula for calculating the wages, but noted that a worker would qualify only after completing a minimum number of hours in the previous year.The proposal, if enacted, would patch a major gap in America’s safety net. Workers in every other developed country are entitled to paid leave, in some cases for more than a year. U.S. workers are only eligible for unpaid leave -- that is, they can take time off, but with no guarantee they will get wages during that time. And, by law, only workers in companies with at least 50 workers have that right.Some companies provide paid leave anyway. In the last year, high-profile employers like Facebook and Goldman Sachs introduced or expanded paid leave for their employees. But the majority of American workers aren't eligible for paid leave, and the ones who need it most -- food servers, sales clerks, and other people who can’t afford to forgo paychecks -- are the least likely to have it.Clinton's proposal closely resembles a bill that’s been circulating on Capitol Hill, sponsored by Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.). Sanders, the senator from Vermont who is Clinton’s chief competition for the Democratic nomination, is among its co-sponsors in the Senate and has been touting its virtues repeatedly, and enthusiastically, on the campaign trail.But Clinton’s proposal differs from the bill in one crucial way. In order to finance the replacement wages that workers would get, the Gillibrand-DeLauro bill would impose a small payroll tax, of 0.4 percent, that employers and employees would split evenly. According to the National Partnership for Women and Families, that works out to about $1.50 per week per worker.Sanders has said he supports that approach, because it would represent a tiny sum that the benefits would more than justify. Advocates of this approach note that Social Security and Medicare Part A have similar financing schemes -- and argue that this “social insurance” approach, in which all workers contribute a small amount through payroll taxes, gives programs political resiliency.They also say it’s administratively simple, since an agency like the Social Security Administration already runs such programs and could take on paid leave with relative ease.Clinton has criticized that approach repeatedly because it would mean higher taxes on lower- and middle-income workers. Instead, she has said, government should finance the new benefit by imposing new taxes on only the wealthiest Americans. Clinton says it’s a matter of fairness, since incomes for the wealthy have been rising quickly, but wages for the middle class have been stagnant.Sanders will give a major speech about paid family leave on Friday, in Iowa, site of the first presidential caucus. It’s entirely possible -- some might even say likely -- that the Clinton campaign made its announcement in an effort to preempt him.But the real significance of Clinton’s proposal is probably what it portends for the general election -- and beyond. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), the only Republican presidential candidate to address the issue formally, has said he’d offer small tax breaks to companies that offer paid leave -- an approach unlikely to have much impact, except perhaps to help well-off workers. On the whole, Republicans have said they oppose paid leave guarantees, arguing that such regulations and programs make it harder for businesses to operate and end up hurting the economy.That proposition has had at least one real world test -- in California, which a decade ago implemented a paid leave program much like the one Democrats have in mind now. Researchers have found the program offers clear benefits, allowing more workers to take paid leave and contributing to better maternal and child health as a result. They have not found evidence of damage to the business climate.“The benefit of being one of the last countries in the world to adopt paid maternity leave is that we have been able to learn from other countries' experiences and the results are clear,” Betsey Stevenson, a University of Michigan economist and former adviser to President Barack Obama, told the Huffington Post on Thursday. “Paid leave policies lead to better outcomes for mothers, children, and families.”Republicans will likely control the House of Representatives, and maybe the Senate too, even if a Democrat wins the presidential election. That means both the Clinton and Sanders proposals would face stiff odds of passing. But the issue will probably figure into the fall campaign, and it may figure prominently. To advocates like Heather Boushey, chief economist and executive director of the Washington Center for Equitable Growth, that’s a welcome sign that American politics is finally talking about the challenges of parents who also have jobs. “This is the first presidential election that we’ve had a national debate, at this level, about work-family policy,” said Boushey, who is also an outside adviser to the Clinton campaign. “That’s very exciting.”Also on HuffPost:"

These four lawmakers think that's ridiculous.,2016-01-08,Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) are two of four senators who signed a letter to the chairs of the Senate appropriations committee asking for a hearing on the efficacy of gun-related research done by the CDC.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/568f2de71b00002d00674f94.jpeg?ops=crop_75_0_4962_2036%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Four Northeastern senators are pushing to undo a decades-old policy that effectively bans federally funded research into the root causes and effects of gun violence.In a letter to the chairs of the appropriations committee, Sens. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) called for a hearing on the efficacy of gun-related research done by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Such research has been frozen since 1996, when Congress passed an amendment declaring that funds could not be used by the CDC “to advocate or promote gun control.” In recent months, calls to revisit the issue have grown louder in the wake of high-profile instances of gun violence.In their letter to Chairman Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) and Vice Chairwoman Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), the senators argue that the ban has been dramatically misapplied from its original purpose, noting that its author -- former Rep. Jay Dickey (R-Ark.) -- has expressed regrets that the CDC has stopped doing research into the matter.“We urge the Committee to hold a hearing on funding CDC gun-violence-prevention research, and to invite Rep. Dickey and [Mark] Rosenberg, [Director of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control at the CDC from 1994 to 1999] to testify,” the write. “We must take steps to fund gun-violence research, because only the United States government is in a position to establish an integrated public health research agenda to understand the causes of gun violence and identify the most effective strategies for prevention.”In addition to encouraging an appropriations committee hearing, Markey and Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) have also introduced legislation setting aside $10 million a year for 10 years for the CDC to conduct the research. The latter stands little chance of passage in the current Congress. Even the former might be too big a lift.Lawmakers have shown little appetite to revisit the CDC ban, believing further studies are either wasteful or a pathway toward federally funded advocacy of gun control measures. Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) largely ducked the issue upon assuming his leadership role. But in the recent omnibus appropriations bill -- like all the others since 1996 -- the Dickey language was once again included.
