(Photo by Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad579f3c000066000b26df.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I heard Chris Rock say, ""I won't work colleges anymore, because they've gotten too conservative,"" I paused.In his own words: ""Not in their political views -- not like they're voting Republican -- but in their social views and their willingness not to offend anybody. Kids raised on a culture of 'We're not going to keep score in the game because we don't want anybody to lose.' Or just ignoring race to a fault. You can't say 'the black kid over there.' No, it's 'the guy with the red shoes.' You can't even be offensive on your way to being inoffensive.""This frightened me. If an icon like Chris Rock has to be worried about content, what hope is there for a comedian of my stature?It turns out, none.I recently performed at a university, and it was an unmitigated disaster.Or so I was told.I thought I was receiving a typical college response; the instant the lights went down, I heard nothing but kids talking over me. When I said ""Hello,"" approximately 3 of 150 people responded. The rest were in their own world, eating, talking, and posting selfies to Instagram.I shrugged it off and barreled forward, because I was under contract. I had to sling jokes for thirty minutes, audience indifference be damned. It was with genuine surprise when, twenty-five minutes later, I was pulled from the stage and told I was being offensive.I'm not dense. I knew I wasn't killing it. Had the apathy started half way through my set, I would have said, ""I'm losing them!"" Since disinterest was normal from the get go, I figured, ""This is how it's going to be."" But I never in a million years did I think I was shocking anyone.I asked which of my comments were out of line, and the opening response was: ""Off the top of my head? When you made fun of white people names.""Since it was obvious the students weren't going to pay attention to me telling jokes, I decided to do interactive material. For fifteen minutes I spoke with different tables, making light, situational jokes: ""You only ate half a baby carrot? You were too full to finish a baby carrot?""Groundbreaking? No. Safe? Yes. Hilarious? No. Chuckles from the six kids paying attention? Yes.When I got to a table of Caucasian girls, I became more daring. And by ""slightly,"" I mean .5 on a scale of 1-10.""What's your name?"" I asked the first.""Rachel,"" she responded.""Oh God..."" I groaned, over-emphasizing my exasperation to show absurdity. ""That is the whitest name, ever.""I heard giggles from the background, and the girls laughed, so all was well.Or so I thought.When that moment came back to bite me in the butt, I was floored. I asked for clarification -- how was it offensive? -- and was told, ""The event is multicultural. Our goal is inclusivity."" Pointing out any race, even my own, brought attention to that race, which automatically ""made things uncomfortable.""I wanted to shout, ""For who?""I've been a comedian long enough to know the difference between comfortable and uncomfortable laughter, and what I heard was genuine.The other ""point of offense"" is one I should have seen coming. Up front I wondered whether or not I should do a joke in support of marriage equality. After all, I know people hear trigger words and react to them, not context.The joke itself is at the expense of bigots. I saw a website declaring the #1 threat to America was gay marriage. Not being able to wrap my head around such bigoted thinking, I wrote a joke mocking that viewpoint. It starts with: ""I'll tell you this; I support marriage equality, and I don't understand the arguments against it.""I was told: ""The problem is with you, a heterosexual male talking about gay marriage in the first place. You cannot determine how someone who is homosexual will react to your stance on their issue.""Hearing that, I was at a loss for words.If my joke had been at the expense of homosexuality, then yes, it would have been out of line. But to say I cannot talk about it? That's nonsense. The LGBT community needs me to talk about it. Not as a comedian, as a straight person. The only way marriage equality will happen in America is by having straight people standing side-by-side with the LGBT community, championing their cause. The majority has to see and understand the plight of the minority in order to create change. If the LGBT community were to stand alone on this, legislation would stagnate, and the issue would be dismissed as ""A gay problem."" Just like AIDS was ""A gay problem"" in the 1980s, before straights started dying from it, too.What's funny is that when I was removed from the stage, I had been talking about my kids for ten minutes. It's probably the safest material I have; there's nothing remotely controversial in there. In fact, it's deeply personal material, and at times empathetic. How often do you see a comedian tell an audience he and his wife are donating embryos to an infertile couple? I'm guessing never. I do, and it generally gets a nice pop of laughter at the end, too.Unfortunately, no one had the wits about them to realize, ""OK, he's transitioned. No more hot topics like 'gay marriage' or 'white people names.'"" Likewise, no one had the decency or common sense to think, ""You know what, he only has five minutes left, let him finish."" Because when you're not paying attention to content and you're simply trying to indulge the delicate sensibilities of a society waiting to be outraged, you've already lost.You cannot cater to everyone, and everyone is offended by something.That's life.(Note: as I was writing this, Jerry Seinfield started trending across social media for this quote: ""I don't play colleges but I hear a lot of people tell me, 'Don't go near colleges, they're so PC.' I have no interest in gender or race or anything like that,"" Seinfeld said. ""But everyone else is kind of, with their calculating--is this the exact right mix? I think that's--to me it's anti-comedy. It's more about PC-nonsense.""Amen, brother. I think I'm in good company.)"

The Conservative movement has been running a bar/bat mitzvah program for Israeli children with disabilities for two decades.The cancellation of both ceremonies hit a raw nerve with non-Orthodox Jews because non-Orthodox rabbis and institutions have no legal standing in Israel and, unlike the Orthodox establishment, receive virtually no government funding.Conservative Jews, called Masorti Jews in Israel, said Rivlin’s decision amounts to a de-legitimization of non-Orthodox Jewry.On Sunday, after learning that only an Orthodox rabbi would be permitted to officiate at the ceremony — contradicting a compromise the movement said was brokered by the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs — 23 leaders of the U.S.-based Conservative movement sent a letter to Rivlin calling both cancellations an “act of cruelty in which disabled children and their parents are being denied a service that would help them, and the sole reason for this denial is the contempt of Israel’s leaders for the sponsors of this program, the worldwide Conservative/Masorti movement.“Our love for the State of Israel is unconditional,” the Conservative rabbis wrote. “But Israel must live up to her claims about herself. A modern, scientific, humanitarian, democratic state cannot deny a program to disabled children simply because of your loathing for our Jewish philosophy and practice.”In response, Rivlin’s office said the Conservative leadership in Israel had rejected alternatives, including one to hold the ceremony at the Western Wall followed by a reception at the President’s Residence.“In recent days,” the office said, “frantic efforts were made by the Director General of the President’s Office, the Director of the Ministry of Diaspora Affairs, and others, to find an agreed upon solution to hold the event in a way that would not perpetuate the dispute. … But these too failed due to the obstinacy of the Masorti Movement to stick with the original plan to run the event themselves.”On Monday (June 8), the Conservative movement issued a statement saying the bar mitzvah could not take place at the Western Wall because the children, who have severe autism, would be too distracted.Furthermore, the statement said, the Conservative movement had accepted the compromise of co-officiating alongside an Orthodox rabbi “for the sake of the children, despite the implicit, if not explicit implication by the President that the Masorti/Conservative movement is unfit to officiate over a religious ceremony on its own.”"

Al Sharpton, president, National Action Network, right, looks on. The ministers urged Maryland residents to vote for Question 6 on the November ballot. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae0dbd1f00002e0122d6de.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For over a century, African-American clergy have descended upon Hampton University in Hampton, Virginia for an annual pilgrimage to the Hampton University Ministers' Conference. The week-long convening, held the first full week in June, is regarded as the largest ecumenical gathering of black clergy in the nation. The Conference was regarded as the political, cultural, and theological epicenter of progressive black American Christian thought and praxis, where many of America's civil rights voices like Dr. King, Benjamin Mays, Gardner Taylor, Howard Thurman, and Prathia Hall-Wynn found a spiritual home. It continues to draw big name speakers like T.D. Jakes, President Obama, and a host of other preachers and politicians who clamor for the opportunity to address conference attendees.As upwards of 8,000 clergy convene next week at Hampton University, an interesting yet disturbing subtext has emerged that casts a cloud over the gathering. Ever since the university published the conference brochure earlier this year, many insiders and conference attendees have noticed the name of one clergy leader conspicuously omitted from the list of executive officers. It would seem that the omission of Delman Coates' name as a member of the Executive Council was no accident at all. Rev. Delman Coates, the senior pastor of an 8,000-member church in suburban Washington, D.C. and a former candidate for Lt. Governor of Maryland, was apparently dismissed last year from his leadership post in the conference despite serving his position since 2010. What has troubled observers is the emerging consensus that Coates was ousted because of his vocal support of marriage equality and LGBT rights in Maryland and across the nation.  A leader who has been nationally recognized for his work on issues ranging from gun violence prevention to criminal justice reform, income inequality, and fair policing, Coates has been regarded as a rising star in the fight for human rights and social justice. Ebony Magazine and The Root identified him as being among the nation's most important African American leaders, and Rev. Al Sharpton tapped him to serve on the Board of Directors of the National Action Network.  That is why many progressive black clergy and attendees of the Hampton conference were surprised to see that Coates was dismissed as an officer despite a track record of proven leadership and the Conference's own long-held tradition of progressive leadership. For many others, Coates dismissal is not so surprising given the controversy he has stirred as an outspoken advocate for LGBT rights and marriage equality--issues many black religious leaders remain steadfastly opposed to. In 2012, Coates played what the Human Rights Campaign has called a key role in getting same-sex marriage legalized in Maryland when he supported an initiative legalizing same-sex marriage in Maryland. It appears that Coates' support of LGBT rights has exposed latent bigotry and homophobia within the conference that has characterized other popular segments of American Christianity.  Even more disturbing are the comments made by the Rev. Errol Gilliard, Senior Pastor of the Greater Harvest Baptist Church of Baltimore, Maryland regarding Coates' removal. In a sermon delivered June 15, 2014, two weeks after last year's election of officers and airing on Gilliard's weekly radio broadcast, Gilliard attributes Coates' support of same-sex marriage as the reason Coates was not re-elected. Gilliard states that the chair of Hampton's nominating committee, the Rev. Dr. A.C.D. Vaughn, Senior Pastor of the Sharon Baptist Church of Baltimore, informed him that Coates' support of marriage equality came with ""consequences,"" the consequence in this instance being that he was not welcome back as an officer of the Hampton University Ministers' Conference (Click HERE for audio clip of Gilliard's sermon). Misogyny and homophobia -- disguised as theological orthodoxy -- have a long history in the black church. Based upon Coates' public writings, it appears that his work is an attempt to model an alternative vision of the Black church's stance on gay rights. His quiet dismissal is an unfortunate reminder that the Black church has more work to do on the issue of inclusion and compassion. The Conference's affiliation with Hampton University, an institution of higher learning that claims to support intellectual freedom and diversity, is also deeply disturbing. Coates' dismissal is being viewed by some as a move by conference leadership to police the free flow of ideas within the black church and to make a strong statement about the Conference's stance on LGBT rights. A conference that for many was at one time a bastion of progressive African American religious thought, now appears to have come under the influence of an ecclesiastical sub-culture that seeks to punish theological diversity on matters of sexuality and engage in professional reprisal. While it is still a special gathering, much of the justice emphasis that characterized the conference in the past, has been replaced by an emphasis on personal piety, a trend reflective of the current Christian landscape in America.For #BlackLivesMatter and other 21st century freedom movements, issues of community, solidarity, are intersectionality in the Black community are more poignant than ever before. And the people that have long been excluded from our communities will no longer be silenced or support institutions that refuse to openly support them. The Black church is not exempt, though it has served interminably as a source of cultural pride and preservation, education, economic support, and political organization within our community. The Black church's capacity for mobilization of the Black community still cannot be overstated. That is why it's leadership and theological trajectory could never be more important than right now.Can the black church hope to retain its legacy ground-zero for social justice work if it refuses to ""do justice and love mercy"" in the areas of gender and sexual orientation while silencing religious leaders like Coates and others who seek to make equality a lasting reality for all people? Should it? If justice is indivisible as Dr. King said, can the same black clergy who oppose LGBT equality be taken seriously in their public protests against police brutality? If Coates' dismissal from leadership in one of the nation's largest ecumenical gatherings of black clergy is any indication, the black church is prepared to further entrench itself in centuries old ways of thinking that have oppressed and marginalized more folks than it has liberated and helped to save.

3,POLITICS,Republicans Have Always Been At War With The New York Times,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-versus-the-nyt_n_7547640.html,,2015-06-09,"WASHINGTON, DC - MAY 20: Republican presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) questions Assistant U.S. Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Roberta Jacobson as she testifies before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee May 20, 2015 in Washington, DC.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ff712400003000990188.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"So, who's got their dander up, in the world of the 2016 election? By the looks of things, it's Sen. Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican, who was hopping mad on Tuesday at The New York Times. Congratulations to him, for earning his ""Beefing with the Times"" merit badge, a GOP tradition. What happened? Well, the Times published an article that takes a rather robust look at Rubio's personal financial dealings, documenting ""a series of decisions over the past 15 years that experts called imprudent."" There's a litany of said decisions to pore over: the mixing of ""personal and political money,"" a prematurely cashed out retirement account, ""significant debt,"" and some ""inattentive accounting."" There's even a boat involved, somehow. Great day for boats.Rubio, as a career politician, will one day cash out and leave the world of ""worrying about money"" far behind. Meantime, he can't possibly be sincerely worried about his wealth, but the piece has him fit to be tied anyway. As Bloomberg's Sahil Kapur reports:To the Rubio campaign, this was an arrogant attack on a self-made man who came from modest means. The campaign titled an e-mailed statement to reporters on Tuesday ""Elitist New York Times calls Marco's Student Loan Debts 'A Deep Financial Hole of his Own Making.'"" Various conservatives unaffiliated with his campaign backed him up. Did it suddenly become out of bounds to report on the financial dealings of presidential candidates? If so, that rule comes too late for many of the people working the 2016 hustings. Back in December, Bloomberg's Joshua Green reported on Jeb Bush's ""Mitt Romney Problem"": A number of ""recent business ventures reveal that he shares a number of liabilities with the last nominee."" Is there something to Rubio's complaint that the Times' seems especially insensitive to the fact that many of the things embedded in the newspaper's report, characterized as lapses in financial judgment, are prevalent in the everyday lives of most Americans of modest means? Perhaps, but this isn't a new thing for the media to report on, either. In April, The Daily Beast's Betsy Woodruff published a story about Scott Walker's alarming (or, at least ""alarming"" to us commoners) credit card debt. It's possible that the anger Rubio and his allies are manifesting today at the Grey Lady may be mostly over yesterday's news, specifically a June 5 piece in the Times that documented that Rubio and his wife Jeanette ""had a combined 17 citations"" for various driving violations over many years. Or, as a Miami native might contextualize the story: Marco and Jeanette Rubio are some of the Sunshine State's better drivers.The Times' piece on the Rubio family's moving violations was almost universally derided as something that wasn't worth publishing. But it's likely this weird campaign story -- quite understandably -- planted a seed of ire in Rubio that is now blooming and, as Bloomberg's Kapur notes, joining many other flowers in the garden: ""If going to war with the New York Times is a rite of passage for Republican presidential candidates, Marco Rubio's moment has come early."" Same as it ever was, folks. From as far back as that time President George W. Bush referred to reporter Adam Clymer as a ""major league asshole from The New York Times,"" conservatives have alternated between airing operatic grievances about the paper in public, to reveling in the perceived mutual animosity as a form of political performance art. It's hardly a secret that Republican politicians prefer to portray the Paper Of Record as an elitist and out-of-touch outpost, created for and by the East Coast's liberal intelligentsia. If anything, that's just the way conservatives compliment the Times. You should hear them when they actually want to bloody their knuckles. That's when you get people like Rep. Peter King (R-N.Y.) calling the paper ""apologists for terrorists,"" and one-time presidential aspirant Herman Cain accusing it of being akin to the Ku Klux Klan, simply for publishing an opinion piece with which he disagreed.Rubio's not the first person in the 2016 campaign to feel slighted by the Times. When the Times' Nate Cohn published ""Why Ted Cruz Is Such A Long Shot"" -- a poli-sci analysis of Cruz' challenges as a presidential candidate -- Cruz responded by calling the paper ""a leftist rag."" Of course, ""left vs. right"" had little to do with the conclusions Cohn reached, but the idea that Cohn was somehow biased likely didn't factor much into Cruz's response, either. Cruz just did what comes naturally -- keep his base engaged and positive with a shot at the New York paper. To a certain extent, a Republican almost has to be ready to put the Times on blast, just to please the base. Jeb Bush once told Fox News Radio's ""Kilmeade And Friends"": ""I don’t read The New York Times to be honest with you, so I guess you’re going to force me to do so.” As it turned out, that wasn't entirely true, and there was a paper trail to demonstrate otherwise.New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told the same CPAC audience that he was not a subscriber, and that he had recently given up the paper for Lent, all in the space of a few contradictory minutes. Whatever the truth was, in these instances, smacking the Times had to be done. They certainly wouldn't have wanted to make the mistake of complimenting the newspaper, as Tucker Carlson once famously did, to some amount of regret.Of course, as long as we're keeping score here, it's worth noting that Democratic politicians and their allies also are apt to complain about Times coverage. If you cast your mind back to the 2000 campaign, you might remember that Bob Somerby's regular criticism of Times shallow-ender Kit Seelye was the stuff of political blogging legend. Closer to the here and now, Media Matters has been on the warpath with the Times for some time, deriding everything from the paper's cozy arrangements with Clinton Cash author Peter Schweizer to Maureen Dowd's bizarre columns. The organization's contention is that ""since the beginning of the year, Republicans are routinely given positive characterizations and compliments, while presumptive Democratic favorite Clinton is often not -- and more often depicted on the Times' front page as either mired in setbacks, or certain to face daunting political challenges."" (I guess Marco Rubio ends this trend.)Still, you shouldn't be thought an idiot if you observe that there is a different quality to the umbrage directed at the paper, depending on whether you're a liberal or a conservative. Surely it's not controversial to note that a Republican who's angry at the Times is more likely to characterize the paper's slings and arrows as business as usual, while a Democrat would probably view it as an unexpected burn. Does this variance in reaction help to promulgate the notion that the Times' is politically biased? Possibly!But one thing's for sure, you're never going to see a Democratic politician wear a Times' slight as a badge of honor. That is the sole province of Republicans like Rick Santorum, who said that his March 2012 dust-up with Times scribe Jeff Zeleny was not a thing he regretted doing. ""You know, if you're a conservative and you haven't taken on a New York Times reporter, you're not worth your salt as far as I'm concerned."" Mike Huckabee said much the same back in February 2008, when he responded to an outburst of anger from Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) over a New York Times story like so: ""If anything, it's helped John McCain and I'm kind of hoping The New York Times will take me on and run a nasty front page story -- may be the best thing that could happen to me, certainly was to him.""I'm not sure McCain agreed on that score. What Huckabee's glib comment masked was the fact that McCain had a very worthy complaint. The Times had just published its infamous ""Vicki Iseman story"" -- a fluffed-out nothing-burger bun that laid out a hilariously unsubstantiated claim about McCain acting ""inappropriately"" with Iseman, an Alcade & Fay lobbyist. It was one of the most cynical stories penned during the 2008 campaign. It outraged both the McCain camp and Iseman's employers, and perhaps treated McCain confidant John Weaver the poorest of all. (Weaver's zealous defense of McCain was packaged by the Times as a ""methinks the McCain defender doth protest too much"" signal that something was, indeed, afoot.)All of which demonstrates that the standard Republican positioning against The New York Times isn't entirely unearned, and where the Times has earned it, the complaints often come from pieces that really didn't need to be published, like last week's bit of faff over the Rubio family's automotive misadventures. Did we need to know about that? Not really. But as the journalism industry hasn't yet figured out a way to monetize restraint, here we are, welcoming Marco Rubio to a proud ideological tradition. Perhaps Rubio had a better cause for anger last week than he does today. Based on the context and the content of those two Rubio stories, that's how I'd conclude. Either way: enemy sighted, enemy met.Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?"
4,POLITICS,Congress Is Poised To Make Illegal Torture More Illegal,Ali Watkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cia-torture-congress_n_7547768.html,,2015-06-09,"Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. arrives to make a statement after a closed hearing to examine certain intelligence matters in Washington, Thursday, April 3, 2014. The Senate Intelligence Committee's expected vote to approve declassifying part of a secret report on Bush-era interrogations of terrorism suspects puts the onus on the CIA and a reluctant White House to speed the release of one of the most definitive accounts about the government's actions after the 9/11 attacks. (AP Photo/Molly Riley)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ff723c000018010e04bc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A bipartisan group of lawmakers did Tuesday what rights groups and a broad chorus of government officials have urged for years: In this year’s National Defense Authorization Act, lawmakers proposed Congress formally outlaw torture. In an amendment sponsored by Armed Services Committee chair Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz) and Senate Intelligence Committee vice-chair Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) -- who spearheaded that panel’s gruesome report released late last year on the Bush-era CIA torture program -- lawmakers in no uncertain terms forbid the use of torture by any element of the United States government and affirm the U.S. Army Field Manual as the accepted guide to interrogation practices.For what it's worth, torture is already illegal under several different statutes, including both national law and international law. But McCain's amendment, if passed, would further close certain loopholes that have allowed the U.S. to dance around those legal hurdles in the past.The amendment would effectively make into law the Obama administration’s 2009 executive order forbidding the use of torture by any element of the United States government. Torture critics have voiced concern in recent years that the executive order, while effective, does not have the same staying power as a congressionally passed law, and that a future administration could easily rescind it. In addition, the amendment would require that the Army Field Manual, which some have said is antiquated, be routinely updated every three years. McCain and Feinstein were joined by Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Jack Reed (D-R.I.) in proposing the amendment. Though the amendment isn’t officially tacked on to the bill yet, the proposal marks a notable victory for Feinstein, who has fought -- particularly in the aftermath of the release of the torture report’s 500-page executive summary -- to reform the nation’s interrogation practices so the dark days of the Bush years aren’t repeated. She proposed a wide swath of reforms in the immediate aftermath of the summary’s release, but did not propose anything before the then-Democratic majority Senate switched hands.It has long been rumored that Feinstein was working to bring McCain, a staunch critic of the use of torture, on board for any legislative proposals. His support very likely will be the only hope the amendment has of getting through a GOP-majority Congress -- filled with Republicans who still defend the CIA’s use of harsh tactics, including waterboarding and rectal feeding, against terror suspects in the wake of Sept. 11. Even just last month, it remained unclear if Feinstein would be able to enlist McCain’s support on any torture proposal. Though the Armed Services chair has consistently chastised the agency’s prior use of torture, he suggested cryptically that there were elements of Feinstein’s proposal he wasn't completely on board with, and sources had previously expressed skepticism that the two would find common ground.Rights groups hailed the proposal, though they pointed out that, while a vital first step, there were still gaps. “Today’s proposal is a needed reform, but one that does not go nearly far enough,” Naureen Shah, director of Amnesty International's U.S.-based Security and Human Rights Program, said in a statement. She pointed out that the legislation doesn’t include a prohibition against the CIA operating detention sites overseas. “This effectively leaves the door open to future CIA secret detention operations should a future US administration withdraw the president’s order, potentially an imminent risk given next year’s election,” she said.But allowing those gaps may be the only way to get anything through a Congress that’s still stacked with defenders of the CIA’s now-defunct torture program. Laura Pitter, senior national security counsel at Human Rights Watch, also praised the proposal. But, she said, it doesn’t hold much water if those responsible for the CIA program continue to not be held accountable.“Requiring the CIA and other US agencies to abide by one uniform set of interrogation rules will help prevent torture,” she said in a statement. “But such legal fixes won’t carry weight in the future if those responsible for torture in the past aren’t brought to justice.”A coalition of human rights groups, including the American Civil Liberties Union, the Center for Victim's of Torture and Human Rights First, praised the proposal, saying it was an imperative step forward.""More can and should be done to pursue accountability for past brutal and illegal interrogations and to improve the Interrogation Manual,"" read a joint statement from the Open Society Policy Center, part of that coalition. ""But the McCain-Feinstein Amendment is a vital and welcome step toward ensuring that the United States never again uses torture.""McCain confirmed earlier this year to HuffPost that he was working to insert a torture provision into the NDAA, which his committee spearheads. Yet to be seen is whether he can rally enough of his GOP colleagues to support it with him.This article has been updated to include comment from a coalition of human rights groups."

The White House press room was evacuated and a Secret Service sniffer dog deployed Tuesday as reporters were gathered for a scheduled briefing. Journalists, including an AFP reporter, were escorted out as a security sweep was performed. Outside the executive mansion, the north lawn area was also evacuated as staff and journalists were moved to a neighboring building. No reason was immediately given for the evacuation.

Meanwhile, TV cameras that crews had left on the White House lawn were swiveled toward the ground, according to journalists' tweets, presumably moved by Secret Service agents during their sweep of the premises. After the threat was called off and the news briefing resumed, ABC News White House correspondent Jon Karl asked White House press secretary Josh Earnest who had tampered with the cameras. Karl reminded the press secretary that the cameras ""are owned by the news organizations"" and not the White House. Earnest, who evacuated the room at the same time as the press corps, said he didn't know what happened. A Secret Service spokeswoman told The Huffington Post that the agency could not comment on its methods. It's rare for the briefing room to be evacuated, especially during a briefing. Journalists were whisked off the White House premises and across the street, indicating that the phoned threat was taken seriously. President Barack Obama remained in the Oval Office during the evacuation, according to CNN. Earnest and some White House staffers moved to the press secretary's office, located in the West Wing near the briefing room. Earlier Tuesday, Capitol police evacuated part of a Senate building during a hearing because of a threat. UPDATE: 5:45 p.m. -- Christi Parsons, a Los Angeles Times reporter and president of the White House Correspondents Association, responded to the incident in a Wednesday email to The Huffington Post.“Any time a law enforcement or government agent lays hands on a journalist’s equipment, we get concerned."" Parsons said. ""At the moment, the WHCA board is trying to figure out exactly what happened in the briefing room on Tuesday and to determine the appropriate response.”"

Now, nearly six years later, that organization, J/P HRO, employs roughly three hundred full-time Haitian staff (a number that vacillates relative to funding). We are involved in many sectors including health, engineering, education, housing, and relocation. To varying degrees, we have worked in psycho-social assistance, prevention and education on violence against women, and an assortment of other needs expressed to us by thousands of Haitian men and women from all walks of life and leadership. And yes, foreign consultants as well.The very concept of aid is, and I believe should be, a constant exploration of societies and self. For foreigners working to supply aid outside of their own countries, not to mention outside of their own homes, or in the mirror itself, it is a constant struggle. It is not the purpose of this piece to supply statistical debate, defense, or criticism. More, it is one practitioner's most current sense of the above mentioned exploration. I am provoked by the recent criticism from ProPublica's Justin Elliot and NPR's Laura Sullivan of the American Red Cross' activities and expenditures related to their response to Haiti's 2010 earthquake through this day, in a June 3rd, 2015 article headlined ""How the Red Cross Raised Half a Billion Dollars for Haiti and Built Six Homes."" Full disclosure: My own organization J/P HRO has been formally supported with Red Cross funds totaling $2,987,000. This number is in no way reflective of the greater and more sustained support The American Red Cross has provided J/P HRO beginning with the supply of thousands of tarps simply to provide dry shelter from storms in the immediate aftermath of the earthquake for families so tragically displaced, and in countless ways since then that are also reflective of resources, financial and otherwise. The American Red Cross has offered numerous organizations largely unrecognized support as they did with the tens of millions of dollars financing the World Food Program's distribution of food goods to displaced Haitians that immediately followed the earthquake. That list could go on and brings us full circle to where we are factually today, and where we might be in spirit were it our choice to engage in international aid.Haiti is, in so many ways, like anywhere else in the world. Where it is poorer, it is more resilient, and perhaps, more imaginative. Where it is corrupt, its anti-corruption is heroic. Where it is bitter, it is a judgment only to be cast upon itself. And where it is hopeful, it is deserving of care, brotherhood, sisterhood, compassion and respect. Like other places, it is ultimately rewarded and denied. Outside of my own personal and familial relationships, it is Haiti and Haitians who have touched and taught me most. Yet still, life and aid remain an exploration. Like in all aspects of life, transparency itself becomes a balance of perception and survival. Identity and agenda. Strategy and will. Yet whenever those things are reliant on dollars and cents, media embrace or oversight, the checks and balances are in the hands of such a varied assortment of personal, institutional, and societal narrow-mindedness, that we rely more than with our own hearts and minds on what has become, on what is, the perception most trending. How can we defy that? How can we rise up? First, with self-reflection and gratitude. I've been working on the ground in Haiti with people who are heroic to me. It has bred this reflection. What my eyes have seen make me grateful to them. What my eyes have seen make me grateful to the American Red Cross. By its detractors, I will certainly be accused of things I will not speculate upon here. By its beneficiaries, I stand in solidarity. My hope in writing this is that those who choose to invest outside their own homes, whether of their hearts, their minds, their bodies, or their wallets, that this may serve more importantly than the targeting of its writer, or a defense of any other person or organization, rather as a simple encouragement to look very deeply into what remains more of a question than an answer."

San Francisco and Berkeley are aiming to become the first U.S. cities to pass per-ounce taxes on sugary drinks. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ff742100002501c9713e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — San Francisco supervisors voted Tuesday to approve health warnings on ads for sugary sodas and some other drinks, saying such beverages contribute to obesity, diabetes and other health problems.It's believed that San Francisco would be the first place in the country to require such a warning on ads for soda if it receives final approval.The ordinance defines sugar-sweetened beverages as drinks with more than 25 calories from sweeteners per 12 ounces. So advertising for such sodas as Coca-Cola Zero and other no-calorie drinks would not require a warning, but ads for regular Coca-Cola would.The ordinance also requires warnings for other products such as sports and energy drinks, vitamin waters and iced teas that exceed the 25 calorie limit. Milk and 100 percent natural fruit and vegetable juice drinks are exempt.The label for billboards and other ads would read: ""WARNING: Drinking beverages with added sugar(s) contributes to obesity, diabetes, and tooth decay. This is a message from the City and County of San Francisco.""The ordinance would require the warning on print advertising within city limits —billboards, walls, taxis and buses. It would not apply to ads appearing in newspapers, circulars, broadcast outlets or the Internet.Soda cans and bottles would not have to carry the warning.Supervisors quickly and unanimously approved the proposal with an 11-0 vote requiring the warning, as well as two other measures aimed at curbing sugary drink consumption.One proposal would prohibit soda ads on city-owned property, much like San Francisco does with tobacco and alcohol. Another would prohibit city funds from being used to buy soda.""These are not harmless products that taste good,"" said Supervisor Scott Wiener, who authored the soda warning proposal. ""These are products that are making people sick and we need to take action.""A 12-oz. can of regular Coke contains 140 calories, all from sugar. The can contains 39 grams of added sugar, which is about 9 teaspoons. One teaspoon of sugar has about 16 calories.Liquid sugar is the new tobacco as far as some public health advocates are concerned. Berkeley approved a soda tax last year, the first in the country to do so, but San Francisco rejected one. Davis, a college town near Sacramento, is requiring restaurants to serve milk and water as the default drink with children's meals.Mayor Ed Lee hasn't taken a position but said through a spokeswoman that he is open to educating people through warning labels on advertisements.Opponents have said it's not fair to single out billboard advertising or sugary drinks.Roger Salazar, a spokesman for CalBev, the state's beverage association, has said, ""It's unfortunate the Board of Supervisors is choosing the politically expedient route of scapegoating instead of finding a genuine and comprehensive solution to the complex issues of obesity and diabetes.""About 32 percent of children and teens in San Francisco are overweight or obese, according to a 2012 study by the California Center for Public Health Advocacy and the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. That figure is lower than Los Angeles, San Jose and Sacramento. "

After the NFL canceled a Tony Romo-organized fantasy football convention in Las Vegas, claiming the event violated league rules, Reid -- a longtime advocate for renaming Washington's NFL team -- tweeted his frustration.Reid also issued a press release criticizing NFL commissioner Roger Goodell for canceling the Las Vegas event just weeks before it was set to take place.“As the top trade show destination for more than two decades, there is no better place than Las Vegas for the inaugural Fantasy Football convention,"" Reid said in the statement. ""Forcing an event to be cancelled a few weeks in advance is unprofessional and unfair to the thousands of workers who rely on the business for their livelihood ... Once again, Commissioner Goodell’s actions have left many shaking their heads and questioning whether the NFL cares more about their profits or their fans.”Reid made a similar critique of the NFL last month, when the league swiftly addressed the ""deflategate"" scandal.The Washington team's owner, Dan Snyder, refuses to change the offensive team name, even after the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office canceled six federal trademark registrations for the name last June.

This is, so far, the most monumental victory in the fight to save Africa's elephants, and a major push back against greed, status symbols and corruption. But the announcement was met with a healthy dose of skepticism as China has not yet committed to any timelines, and considering an elephant is killed every 15 minutes, every day that passes is a gamble on extinction - as populations across Africa decrease the criminal syndicates' investment in ivory increases. According to a report by Environmental Investigation Agency, at least 90% of the ivory coming out of China's carving factories is from poached elephants. This alleged 'legal' market is a front for the illegal market, and unless these markets are shut down, our generation will in all probability be the last to see elephants in the wild. Following up with WildAid's Hong Kong office, Wildlife Campaigner Alex Hofford reflected that China has a 5,000-year history, and they're not known for timelines. Says Hofford, ""In my opinion, when China takes an incremental approach, they do tend to stick to their word. I think China's announcement was a tipping point away from favouring the trade towards favouring the conservation lobby.""A few weeks ago I interviewed Hong Kong lawmaker Dr Elizabeth Quat, who, with support from WildAid, African Wildlife Foundation and Save the Elephants, journeyed to Kenya last year because she wanted to see with her own eyes the devastating extent of Africa's poaching crisis. Photo credit: WildAid - Dr Elizabeth Quat visits DSWT Orphanage in KenyaIn March of this year, the Legislative Councillor crossed a major milestone at the National People's Congress (NPC) meeting in Beijing, with 36 Hong Kong NPC lawmakers sitting in that meeting, she successfully lobbied 32 of them to co-sign a suggestion to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, calling for a domestic ban on ivory sales. Any suggestion with a minimum of 30 signatures ensures that the government has to respond within 12 months. The suggestion was put forward by NPC member Chan Yung as follows:1. In order to effectively fight the illegal import and export of ivory and its products, besides enforcing the laws, there should be laws prohibiting commercial ivory & ivory products related activities illegal in the Mainland. A previous example was the reaffirmation of the ban on rhino horn and tiger bone trade in 1993 which adhered to regulations of CITES. The activities include sale, acquisition, transport, self-carry and postage. I suggest to a ban on sale, acquisition of all ivory and ivory products, as well as transport and self-carry for any commercial purposes.2. To widely promote the awareness on conservation of elephants and other endangered species among consumers, encourage them to say NO to buying and selling of ivory products. And so by joining all the dots, and fast forwarding one year from the time the NPC suggestion was lodged, it is logical to assume that China will be making some more commitments, with timelines, before March 2016. In China's 10 point plan to combat the illegal wildlife trade, delivered in the May 29 speech by Zhao Shucong, Minister of the State Forestry Administration, he acknowledged that, ""President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have made important instructions on how to better conserve wildlife, including elephant, on various occasions.""And in point seven the promise of new Chinese thinking was delivered: ""Seventh, under the legal framework of CITES and domestic laws and regulations, we will strictly control ivory processing and trade until the commercial processing and sale of ivory and its products are eventually halted.""Within hours of these announcements coming to light the U.S. Department of State posted a press statement commending China for their breakthrough commitments. And yet the elephant in the room still stands. Why is the United States so slow to close loopholes and amend their own laws that are allowing the trade of ivory from recently poached elephants?There are no ivory carving factories in the U.S., and federal laws restrict the import, export, and interstate sale of ivory, but intrastate ivory sales, such as Craigslist where people lean on the excuse that their product is pre the 1989 ivory ban, is not adequately regulated, and ivory antiques continue to sell as a smart investment. In the last 12 months only New York and New Jersey have passed landmark bills that ban the sale and purchase of both ivory and rhino horn. In six states the bill was squashed due to opposition, mostly from the antique and hunting industry, but for around half of the U.S. states it's not even on their radar. Searching for answers, I caught up with Patrick Bergin, CEO of African Wildlife Foundation, who is currently in Cape Town attending the World Economic Forum on Africa. Bergin is a member of the Advisory Council that advises the U.S. Presidential Task Force on Wildlife Trafficking, which earlier this year unveiled the U.S.'s National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking. The Strategy reaffirms the U.S.'s commitment to work in partnership with governments, local communities, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector to stem the illegal trade in wildlife, a multi-billion dollar a year industry up there with drugs, arms and human trafficking. Says Bergin, ""President Obama has shown leadership, however American society is still lagging behind. What is needed is a broader grassroots movement that includes business, media, celebrity activists, and the general public, and can leverage its power as a groundswell of popular opinion to encourage strict legislation at the state level as a way of stopping intrastate ivory trade.""Photo credit: savingthewild.comThe decimation of elephants is destroying not only Africa's keystone species and the ecosystems that rely on the world's largest land animal, but it is also fueling conflict and terrorism, derailing tourism, and creating more unemployment and poverty. The current narrative must evolve, and society needs to understand that these animal issues are also human issues. How do we turn this into a movement, in the way that blood diamonds permeated the conscience of American society?""This cause has to become ubiquitous,"" continues Bergin. ""Just as we are currently seeing with airlines refusing to transport hunting trophies.""But with just two U.S. states having passed legislation, it begs the question if there is enough time to get America on side. Bergin points out here that it's not necessarily the number of states who pass legislation so much as getting the most populous states in the U.S. to take action:""Most of the population is on the seaboard. Some of the bigger states like California need to set the pace, in the way that California took the lead on auto emission standards, and then other states like Virginia and Florida will be forced to step up. As in the tail that wags the dog.""Another red flag is that U.S. Fish & Wildlife (USFWS) is extremely under resourced. According to a trafficking feature in The Washington Post, fewer than 330 Fish and Wildlife inspectors and agents patrol the largest U.S. ports, about the same number as 30 years ago, when the agency's law enforcement branch was formed. Since that time, international wildlife trafficking has grown from a small concern into a criminal cesspit. The amount of resources a government devotes to solving a problem indicates how serious it is in tackling that problem. And if a government is not convicting criminals and handing down punitive sentences, that too can contribute to a culture of impunity. Why pedal drugs when you can pedal ivory or rhino horn or pangolin scales? The risks are so low; it's a cake walk for criminals. This is especially true in Africa, agrees Bergin.Photo credit: savingthewild.com""We need more resources put into prosecution,"" he says. ""Hardly anyone is going to jail in Africa, and certainly not the ringleaders. Criminals need to see other criminals behind bars; otherwise the laws will never act as a deterrent.""  President Obama is to visit Kenya in July, and Bergin tells me they are trying really hard to ensure wildlife trafficking is on the agenda. The country is listed among the world's eight most complicit countries as a source of ivory, and the Port of Mombasa is a major contributor to the illegal transiting of ivory out of Africa.In closing, Patrick Bergin raises an interesting proposition: The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is an independent U.S. foreign aid agency that is fighting against global poverty. Before a country can become eligible to receive assistance, MCC's Board examines its performance on independent and transparent policy indicators, and selects compact-eligible countries based on policy performance. Aid from the MCC has the potential to be a powerful bargaining chip in exposing corruption in Africa, encouraging better governance, and stamping out the illegal wildlife trade.Countries that include Mozambique and Tanzania are receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in aid, and yet they are continually caught out for being complicit in the trade of illegal wildlife. According to a new government survey, Mozambique has lost nearly half of its elephants to organized crime syndicates in just five years, and in November of last year the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) released a damming report that shows Tanzania as a key player in the illegal ivory trade. The poaching is due to a toxic mix of unlawful syndicates, often led by Chinese nationals, and corruption among some Tanzanian government officials. Recent government data shows that Tanzania's elephant population has declined by a catastrophic 60% since 2009.China and the United States will meet next month at the Strategic and Economic Dialogue where the two countries will discuss securing a ban on the commercial sale of ivory. Perhaps a little rivalry between these two super powers to do the right thing - first - may be just what the elephants need right now.

14,GREEN,"In the Race to Save the Elephants, will the U.S. or China Step Up First?","Jamie Joseph, ContributorWildlife Activist :: savingthewild.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/in-the-race-to-save-the-elephants-will-the-us-or-china-step-up-first_b_7505802.html,"This is, so far, the most monumental victory in the fight to save Africa's elephants, and a major push back against greed, status symbols and corruption.",2015-06-08,2015-06-03-1433366808-8010670-photocreditwildaiddrelizabethquatatDSWTorphanage.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-03-1433366808-8010670-photocreditwildaiddrelizabethquatatDSWTorphanage-thumb.jpg,"Photo credit: Environmental Investigation AgencyOn the 29th of May conservationists and global citizens all over the world were celebrating the Government of China's announcement that they would eventually halt the commercial processing and sale of ivory and its products. This is, so far, the most monumental victory in the fight to save Africa's elephants, and a major push back against greed, status symbols and corruption. But the announcement was met with a healthy dose of skepticism as China has not yet committed to any timelines, and considering an elephant is killed every 15 minutes, every day that passes is a gamble on extinction - as populations across Africa decrease the criminal syndicates' investment in ivory increases. According to a report by Environmental Investigation Agency, at least 90% of the ivory coming out of China's carving factories is from poached elephants. This alleged 'legal' market is a front for the illegal market, and unless these markets are shut down, our generation will in all probability be the last to see elephants in the wild. Following up with WildAid's Hong Kong office, Wildlife Campaigner Alex Hofford reflected that China has a 5,000-year history, and they're not known for timelines. Says Hofford, ""In my opinion, when China takes an incremental approach, they do tend to stick to their word. I think China's announcement was a tipping point away from favouring the trade towards favouring the conservation lobby.""A few weeks ago I interviewed Hong Kong lawmaker Dr Elizabeth Quat, who, with support from WildAid, African Wildlife Foundation and Save the Elephants, journeyed to Kenya last year because she wanted to see with her own eyes the devastating extent of Africa's poaching crisis. Photo credit: WildAid - Dr Elizabeth Quat visits DSWT Orphanage in KenyaIn March of this year, the Legislative Councillor crossed a major milestone at the National People's Congress (NPC) meeting in Beijing, with 36 Hong Kong NPC lawmakers sitting in that meeting, she successfully lobbied 32 of them to co-sign a suggestion to the National People's Congress Standing Committee, calling for a domestic ban on ivory sales. Any suggestion with a minimum of 30 signatures ensures that the government has to respond within 12 months. The suggestion was put forward by NPC member Chan Yung as follows:1. In order to effectively fight the illegal import and export of ivory and its products, besides enforcing the laws, there should be laws prohibiting commercial ivory & ivory products related activities illegal in the Mainland. A previous example was the reaffirmation of the ban on rhino horn and tiger bone trade in 1993 which adhered to regulations of CITES. The activities include sale, acquisition, transport, self-carry and postage. I suggest to a ban on sale, acquisition of all ivory and ivory products, as well as transport and self-carry for any commercial purposes.2. To widely promote the awareness on conservation of elephants and other endangered species among consumers, encourage them to say NO to buying and selling of ivory products. And so by joining all the dots, and fast forwarding one year from the time the NPC suggestion was lodged, it is logical to assume that China will be making some more commitments, with timelines, before March 2016. In China's 10 point plan to combat the illegal wildlife trade, delivered in the May 29 speech by Zhao Shucong, Minister of the State Forestry Administration, he acknowledged that, ""President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have made important instructions on how to better conserve wildlife, including elephant, on various occasions.""And in point seven the promise of new Chinese thinking was delivered: ""Seventh, under the legal framework of CITES and domestic laws and regulations, we will strictly control ivory processing and trade until the commercial processing and sale of ivory and its products are eventually halted.""Within hours of these announcements coming to light the U.S. Department of State posted a press statement commending China for their breakthrough commitments. And yet the elephant in the room still stands. Why is the United States so slow to close loopholes and amend their own laws that are allowing the trade of ivory from recently poached elephants?There are no ivory carving factories in the U.S., and federal laws restrict the import, export, and interstate sale of ivory, but intrastate ivory sales, such as Craigslist where people lean on the excuse that their product is pre the 1989 ivory ban, is not adequately regulated, and ivory antiques continue to sell as a smart investment. In the last 12 months only New York and New Jersey have passed landmark bills that ban the sale and purchase of both ivory and rhino horn. In six states the bill was squashed due to opposition, mostly from the antique and hunting industry, but for around half of the U.S. states it's not even on their radar. Searching for answers, I caught up with Patrick Bergin, CEO of African Wildlife Foundation, who is currently in Cape Town attending the World Economic Forum on Africa. Bergin is a member of the Advisory Council that advises the U.S. Presidential Task Force on Wildlife Trafficking, which earlier this year unveiled the U.S.'s National Strategy for Combating Wildlife Trafficking. The Strategy reaffirms the U.S.'s commitment to work in partnership with governments, local communities, nongovernmental organizations, and the private sector to stem the illegal trade in wildlife, a multi-billion dollar a year industry up there with drugs, arms and human trafficking. Says Bergin, ""President Obama has shown leadership, however American society is still lagging behind. What is needed is a broader grassroots movement that includes business, media, celebrity activists, and the general public, and can leverage its power as a groundswell of popular opinion to encourage strict legislation at the state level as a way of stopping intrastate ivory trade.""Photo credit: savingthewild.comThe decimation of elephants is destroying not only Africa's keystone species and the ecosystems that rely on the world's largest land animal, but it is also fueling conflict and terrorism, derailing tourism, and creating more unemployment and poverty. The current narrative must evolve, and society needs to understand that these animal issues are also human issues. How do we turn this into a movement, in the way that blood diamonds permeated the conscience of American society?""This cause has to become ubiquitous,"" continues Bergin. ""Just as we are currently seeing with airlines refusing to transport hunting trophies.""But with just two U.S. states having passed legislation, it begs the question if there is enough time to get America on side. Bergin points out here that it's not necessarily the number of states who pass legislation so much as getting the most populous states in the U.S. to take action:""Most of the population is on the seaboard. Some of the bigger states like California need to set the pace, in the way that California took the lead on auto emission standards, and then other states like Virginia and Florida will be forced to step up. As in the tail that wags the dog.""Another red flag is that U.S. Fish & Wildlife (USFWS) is extremely under resourced. According to a trafficking feature in The Washington Post, fewer than 330 Fish and Wildlife inspectors and agents patrol the largest U.S. ports, about the same number as 30 years ago, when the agency's law enforcement branch was formed. Since that time, international wildlife trafficking has grown from a small concern into a criminal cesspit. The amount of resources a government devotes to solving a problem indicates how serious it is in tackling that problem. And if a government is not convicting criminals and handing down punitive sentences, that too can contribute to a culture of impunity. Why pedal drugs when you can pedal ivory or rhino horn or pangolin scales? The risks are so low; it's a cake walk for criminals. This is especially true in Africa, agrees Bergin.Photo credit: savingthewild.com""We need more resources put into prosecution,"" he says. ""Hardly anyone is going to jail in Africa, and certainly not the ringleaders. Criminals need to see other criminals behind bars; otherwise the laws will never act as a deterrent.""  President Obama is to visit Kenya in July, and Bergin tells me they are trying really hard to ensure wildlife trafficking is on the agenda. The country is listed among the world's eight most complicit countries as a source of ivory, and the Port of Mombasa is a major contributor to the illegal transiting of ivory out of Africa.In closing, Patrick Bergin raises an interesting proposition: The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) is an independent U.S. foreign aid agency that is fighting against global poverty. Before a country can become eligible to receive assistance, MCC's Board examines its performance on independent and transparent policy indicators, and selects compact-eligible countries based on policy performance. Aid from the MCC has the potential to be a powerful bargaining chip in exposing corruption in Africa, encouraging better governance, and stamping out the illegal wildlife trade.Countries that include Mozambique and Tanzania are receiving hundreds of millions of dollars in aid, and yet they are continually caught out for being complicit in the trade of illegal wildlife. According to a new government survey, Mozambique has lost nearly half of its elephants to organized crime syndicates in just five years, and in November of last year the Environmental Investigation Agency (EIA) released a damming report that shows Tanzania as a key player in the illegal ivory trade. The poaching is due to a toxic mix of unlawful syndicates, often led by Chinese nationals, and corruption among some Tanzanian government officials. Recent government data shows that Tanzania's elephant population has declined by a catastrophic 60% since 2009.China and the United States will meet next month at the Strategic and Economic Dialogue where the two countries will discuss securing a ban on the commercial sale of ivory. Perhaps a little rivalry between these two super powers to do the right thing - first - may be just what the elephants need right now.

15,HEALTHY LIVING,Turning Mistakes Into Motivation,"Ornish Living, ContributorFor anyone who is interested in leading a healthful lifestyle",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/turning-mistakes-into-mot_b_7506562.html,The encouraging news is that mistakes are necessary for learning -- and motivation -- to occur.,2015-06-08,2015-06-03-1433371133-7476511-forkintheroadBSOu1eO.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-06-03-1433371133-7476511-forkintheroadBSOu1eO-thumb.jpg,"By Mimi O'ConnorStaying healthy is the most rewarding investment we can make in improving the quality of our daily lives. Inevitably, because we are human, we will occasionally slip. Many times, it is unintentional, but other times we admit that it is not. Whether intentional or not, when we fall off the wagon or find ourselves at a fork in the road, we ask: How will we respond? What will we do next? Can we gently pick ourselves back up and get back on track, or will we go down that self-destructive, slippery slope of blame and shame?The encouraging news is that mistakes are necessary for learning -- and motivation -- to occur. It's precisely how we learn, provided that we do not descend into self-recrimination for tripping, for being confused, for needing it to be explained to us over and over, for getting it right for a while and then detouring down the wrong path again. If each mistake is met with criticism alone, it is inevitable that our self-worth will diminish rapidly, leaving us paralyzed with fear and unable to try again.Silencing Our Internal BullyUnfortunately, the reflexive muscle of blame grows larger over the years because of the secret inventory that we keep of our perceived failures. Blame always speaks first and loudest in our self-talk. This occurs, not because it is valid, but because we have allowed it to become an overdeveloped, internal bully.We can silence our internal bully by learning how to be motivated by our mistakes instead of debilitated by them. We begin with the practice of choosing to respond to mistakes with compassion, optimism, and gentle correction instead of shaming and ruthless criticism. By doing this, we will develop a new muscle of self-acceptance. Mistakes are never to be ignored, glossed over, or denied, but they also aren't to be blown out of proportion and used against us when we falter. We can reframe them as an opportunity to encourage further exploration and adjustment. Mistakes provide us with valuable information that we can use as means to achieve a more constructive end, never to be used as an end, in and of themselves.Retrieving Our OptimismI remember feeling comforted when I heard a quote from the comedian Carol Burnett: ""I haven't learned a thing from my successes. Everything I've learned has been from my alleged failures."" What we label as our perceived failures often results from the adversity, both large and small, that confronts us every day. The ripple effects of being thrown off center are not small. When we feel lousy, we slip into making less than optimal choices. Our exercise, nutrition, stress management and connection with others gets pushed aside. We find ourselves saying, ""I'm wiped out, I'm too tired to exercise;"" ""My mind is racing, there's no way I can sit still to meditate;"" ""I'll just grab some comfort food to shut up these feelings and make it all go away for a minute;"" ""I see my neighbors, but I'm going around the back way, so I don't have to talk to anyone."" As we veer farther away from making healthful choices, we feel worn down, more isolated, less confident in our ability to take care of ourselves.At this vulnerable juncture, we must first make a decision to retrieve our optimism, ""I can do this, and I want to feel better!"" Secondly, we can align our dusted-off optimism with realism, ""I need and deserve help to get back on track."" Consistency and Compassion; Not PerfectionTo apply this heart-healing roadmap, two applications are indispensable: consistency and compassion. Consistency means that I am willing to keep showing up daily to my lifestyle choices. I am willing to be accountable, not perfect. Perfectionism is an unforgiving taskmaster and overtime, will completely debilitate the ability to be consistent. Ruthlessly, it focuses solely on outward appearances, always at the expense of inner well-being. It never allows wiggle room for error, but instead fosters self-loathing and depression. Daily, gentle dedication to a balanced and fair assessment of both what we are doing right, and also what we could improve, fosters our self-worth. This self-worth is the grounding touchstone that enables us to rise above any temporary setback. In this study, Canadian researchers found that unconditional self-acceptance mediated the negative consequences of perfectionism on depression.Practicing compassion for oneself will also foster self-acceptance. Compassion reaches down when we slip, smiles lovingly and with mercy, and helps us to recalibrate our self-esteem. It is neither impressed nor depressed by our mistakes. No matter the circumstance, it responds in the same way. It says, ""I believe in you. You deserve another chance. In fact, take as many as you need.""As we learn and grow from our daily lifestyle practice, we inevitably may detour, but we will not get lost. Through consistency and compassion and self-acceptance, we will always find our way back home.When you stray from your healthy lifestyle practice, what helps you to get back on track?This post was originally published on Ornish Living."
16,WOMEN,How to Communicate on Difficult Subjects and Win -- A True Story,"Marilyn Tam, ContributorSpeaker, author of ""The Happiness Choice"" consultant, board-ce...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-to-communicate-on-difficult-subjects-and-win----a-true-story_b_7516224.html,Being a pioneer has many rewards; some tangible and some equally wonderful intangible ones. The benefits spread much wider than we can ever imagine. And what about you? What difficult communication challenge are you facing? Can you find the common ground to break through to the collaboration?,2015-06-08,Woman using a Blackberry style mobile communication device to send a text message during a business meeting in a modern office,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6050f3c000018010d209b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"On June 3, the Association of Women in Communications Santa Barbara honored me with the Pioneer in Communications Award. We Chinese have a saying for almost any occasion. And there's one for this occasion: Local ginger is never hot. What that means is that when something is readily available, it is not valued. I've received honors from other states, and other countries but to receive this particular honor from my hometown, where I can be found going to the farmers' market in my grubby clothes, now this is special. This is a notable achievement for this little girl from Hong Kong. As a child communication for me was one way -- from them to me, and I better remember that if I didn't want a beating. Yet under those rather harsh conditions I had a light. My grandfather who gave me my Chinese name, Hay-Lit the name of two of the most noteworthy Chinese emperors, one known for his compassion and governance in peacetime and one known for his strategy and prowess in times of war. It was a name usually given to the first-born son of a prominent family, not wasted on the second girl child. But somehow my grandfather must have sensed something special in me since he named me Hay-Lit after these powerful emperors.I took that to mean that I was meant for greatness, and I'm not a waste of a pregnancy like my mother regularly told me I was. We all have people in our lives who believe in us; keep those thoughts and experiences close to your heart to encourage and support you when you are feeling small and inadequate. Use them to help you and inspire you to get up again after you've fallen down. We all fall down at times and it is up to us to use the inspiration and support of others to help us get up again. Being a pioneer means that we go where few have gone before. To make a new path for others to follow. That is the opportunity of being a pioneer, we get to forge a way, bumping into obstacles and experiencing frustration are part of the journey, but oh the joy of achieving new heights make it all more than worthwhile.Like the time I was in Korea to deal with a huge production problem. Sixty thousand dozen jeans were at stake. I was in Seoul to negotiate with the factory group who had messed up our order. Drawing the production flow chart on the white board, I was outlining the possibilities we have to remedy the situation. The room was quiet, the 17 Korean male executives inhaled and exhaled clouds of cigarette smoke as they listened; the only sound was an occasional clink made by the young female clerical emptying the individual ashtrays.After over an hour of outlining potential scenarios I asked if there were questions. A hand shot up immediately, it was from Mr. Park the big boss. How old are you and are you married? Ah, I wish I could have said what came to my mind. But being a pioneer in communication means that you are there to find a solution, not tell your business partner that your personal life was none of his business. Taking a deep breath of that smoky air I smiled and thanked him for his concern for my wellbeing and redirected the conversation to the crisis at hand. By the end of the day we worked out a resolution. We would slide the delivery date out a couple of weeks and the factory would pay for air freighting the jeans after they were repaired. I spoke to Mr. Park afterwards one on one, and we came to a new understanding of each other as professionals. Over the years we have become friends, and until he retired five years ago, he would visit me whenever he came to the U.S. I found a professional respect for Mr. Park and it seems he found a new way to deal with women in business. That is one of the joys of being a pioneer in communication.Another pioneering adventure I was privileged to experience was working with Bhutan to take their unique concept of their country and people's wellbeing to the world. They measure how well the country is doing by Gross National Happiness, GNH instead of Gross Domestic Product, GDP like most of the world. The health, education, community, sustainability and spirituality of the people were measured to give them an index of happiness. In 2004 I went to Bhutan for the first time. It was only a few years since the kingdom allowed cable television and Internet into the country. The kingdom was closed to the outside world until 1999. I met the Bhutanese Minister of Home and Culture on my flight into the country, and as the saying goes, the rest is history. I started working with the Minister and the Queen to help formulate the country's transition from the 19th century to the 21st century while maintaining their values of Gross National Happiness. I had a special reason for wanting to work with them. My mentor, Dr. Robert Muller, the late assistant Secretary General of the United Nations had asked me to propose to the King of Bhutan to take their concept of Happiness to the United Nations. I wasn't sure how I was going to achieve that but miraculously the opportunity presented itself on my first flight into Bhutan. Be prepared and watch for any opening to further your cause.In March 2013, the United Nations declared March 20th as the first International Day of Happiness and March 20th would henceforth be the International Day of Happiness. It took nine years for my dream to be realized but it is now real. Unfortunately Dr. Muller passed away before the UN declared the International Day of Happiness, but I know he was smiling and playing Beethoven's Ode to Joy on his harmonica as he watched the UN declaration from heaven.Being a pioneer has many rewards; some tangible and some equally wonderful intangible ones. The benefits, like the International Day of Happiness, spread much wider than we can ever imagine. And what about you? What difficult communication challenge are you facing? Can you find the common ground to break through to the collaboration? To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others. ~ Tony Robbins"
17,SPORTS,11 Reasons To Get Excited For The 2015 Women's U.S. World Cup Team,Justin Block,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/womens-world-cup-2015-us-united-states_n_7514610.html,In case you weren't already pumped.,2015-06-08,"FILE - In this May 30, 2015, file photo, a spectator watches warm-ups before an international friendly soccer match between South Korea and the United States in Harrison, N.J. In broadcasting the Women's World Cup, Fox executives are thrilled for the chance to potentially see the favored U.S. team make a run to the title. But what can really draw in viewers is the realization that the Americans could lose. (AP Photo/Julio Cortez, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb77ece200000990001687f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team is facing a drought. It’s been 16 years since they won their last World Cup, and much has changed within the team on and off the field. Christie Rampone, 39, is the only player remaining from the national team that won it all in 1999 -- and propelled women’s soccer in the U.S. to dizzying heights. With new talent and a changing landscape for the sport, this 2015 squad has the potential to improve upon the legacy of 1999. Similar to their male counterparts, interest in the U.S. women’s game waxes and wanes with every World Cup cycle -- bandwagoners in American flag bandanas and replica jerseys are loaded onto the fevered month-long ride every four years, only to grumble when Team USA inevitably falls short playing a game that the majority of the population won’t think about until, well, the next World Cup. The difference, however, between the men and the women’s U.S. soccer teams is stark. The U.S. women, since 1999, have been expected to win every World Cup. And it’s no different this year. In fact, expectations are higher than ever for the women, and as their send-off game against South Korea last Saturday proved, the fervor surrounding this team is palpable. That and more is why we’ll be enjoying the ride until the final whistle blows on the U.S. Women’s 2015 World Cup run in Canada. 1. The rosters are stacked like never before. Make no mistake: In terms of talent and trophies, this team has a chance to be the best in U.S. Women’s history. Featuring three generations of American stars -- from Rampone to Abby Wambach to 22-year-old Morgan Brian -- the U.S. will arguably have the best lineup at every point during the tournament. The kids from 2011 are grown up -- Alex Morgan and Sydney Leroux are the most electric forward pairing in the tournament, and midfielders Tobin Heath and Lauren Holiday are four years the wiser. Key veterans like winger Megan Rapinoe, forward Heather O’Reilly and defender Becky Sauerbrunn are still in their primes. In all, 14 women from that 2011 World Cup runner-up team were picked this go-around by head coach Jill Ellis, and 15 of the 23-woman roster have previous World Cup experience.  Alex Morgan scores against Japan in the 2011 World Cup Final. (Credit: ESPN) 2. Star veterans in the squad face their highest stakes yet. For one generation of U.S. Women, this may be their last chance to better the 1999 team and finally win a damn World Cup. Wambach, Carli Lloyd, Shannon Boxx, and Hope Solo -- all over 30 years old -- have won basically everything else there is to win in international women’s soccer. They’ve already been crowned champions at the Olympics, Gold Cup and Algarve Cup.Speaking to U.S. Soccer in April, Lloyd confirmed that the sting of losing to Japan in the 2011 World Cup final has galvanized the squad. “We fell short, and there was some unfinished business,” she said. Ellis went a step further, telling Sports Illustrated in April that “we need Abby Wambach to win a World Cup."" Wambach, who will likely retire after the tournament, desperately wants to ride off on the highest note of her career. ""I want to go off into the sunset with a world championship around my neck,"" Wambach told The Huffington Post last week. 3. Underdogs are ready to make an impact. Who doesn’t love a good underdog story? Eight months ago, defender Julie Johnston wasn’t even on the U.S. Women’s roster. Heading into the team’s first match against Australia, she’s not only on the team, but figures to land playing time as the first defender off the bench. The secret to her success? Hard work, a more ambitious attitude, and top-notch coaching from veterans within the squad and select soccer circles.Brian, the youngest member on the team -- a title she’s held throughout her international career, which began as a 15-year-old on the U.S. Women’s U-17 team in 2010 -- will be a World Cup newcomer for the first time alongside Johnston. Expect both of these women to make a big impact this month.4. There’s a positive USWNT landscape beyond the bandwagon.  U.S. Women will travel to their host city with more fan interest in the game than ever. A successful performance by the men's national team at last year's World Cup in Rio has undoubtedly boosted enthusiasm for the ladies’ campaign in Canada. But don’t take my word for it: the proof is in the numbers. Last Saturday, 26,467 fans attended the U.S. Women’s send-off game at Red Bull Arena in Harrison, N.J., -- over four times more than the 5,852 diehards who saw the women’s 2011 send-off game held at the same pitch.That support will likely translate over the border. In April, Fox Sports reported that American fans bought 10,000 tickets for the Women’s World Cup. And for those who don't make it to Canada? You can spend some time with your new favorite players at home, as women will be featured for the first time ever in FIFA 16. 5. Dudes are wearing women’s jerseys. Another first for the U.S. Women: Nike is selling their World Cup jerseys -- yes, the women's kit -- in men’s sizes. Guys are out here proudly repping their favorite U.S. women, and it’s beautiful. 6. An ass-kicking will go down in the ""Group of Death."" The U.S. drew the Group of Death -- a name given to whichever World Cup group looks the toughest. The fact that they’re in Group D (D FOR DEATH, AMIRITE?) is purely coincidental, but also telling. Australia, Sweden, and Nigeria will take on the U.S. for advancement out of the group. All of the teams, save Nigeria, are within FIFA's top ten rankings. All three teams stand to give the U.S. fits, but let’s not kid ourselves here: The U.S. Women are waaaaaaay better than those three teams. FiveThirtyEight pegs the U.S. Women with a 65 percent chance to win the group. 7. Abby Wambach’s head.  When all routes to goal fail, the U.S. women can depend on their battering ram forward up front. She has 178 international goals -- 75 of which were scored with a trademark Wambach header -- and counting.  Abby Wambach’s extra-time header against Brazil in 2011 tied the match. The moment was named “Best Play” at the 2011 ESPYs. (Credit: ESPN) Her 13 career World Cup goals are second all-time to Marta and Birgit Prinz, who have 14 apiece. There’s absolutely no way Wambach leaves Canada without that record. So get ready to witness history.""I have complete trust in Abby,"" Morgan told Sports Illustrated in April. ""Opponents have to play a different way when Abby's on the field. That's crazy.""8. These badass ladies are playing on turf. Because the powers that be at FIFA are sexist pigs, the Women’s World Cup will be the first World Cup -- men or women’s -- to be played on artificial turf. That’s bad. Really, really bad.Last month, Rapinoe voiced her frustration with the turf setup on The Player’s Tribune.“FIFA made a $338 million profit on the 2014 Men’s World Cup. To say that it’s not logistically possible to install real grass at all the stadiums is not acceptable, in my opinion. We have played on grass all our lives. Now we’re going to compete at the highest level on a different surface. I think it has a lot of implications.” The women will tough it out, but they shouldn’t have to. How the turf affects the players and the game itself will be a superficial factor worth watching out for. 9. The odds are in our favor. Let’s take a quick look at what the nerds and bookies think will happen: According to FiveThirtyEight’s projections, the U.S. has a 42 percent chance to reach the Final, and a 28 percent chance to win it all -- the highest percentages amongst the field. (Germany does have nearly identical odds to the U.S. women: FiveThirtyEight gives them a 40 percent chance to reach the Final, and a 27 percent chance to win.) On the betting front, Westgate Las Vegas SuperBook has the U.S. favored to win at 5/2. Germany is 3/1, and Brazil and France are co-favorites at 7/1. 10. Revenge on Germany. Shannon Boxx and Abby Wambach are the only players remaining from the 2003 World Cup team. After winning it all in 1999 on our home turf, the 2003 Women’s World Cup returned to the U.S. It was supposed to be a victorious back-to-back domination by the women, but alas, in the semifinals, they were routed in Portland, Oregon by eventual champions, Germany 3-0. If a U.S.-Germany final happens, Boxx and Wambach would do well to share this painful memory with their younger teammates. It should be the only motivation they need to avenge that loss and snag an elusive World Cup title for Wambach. 11. Primetime matches mean there won’t be any timezone dysphoria for Americans. Any and all U.S.-based followers of European club soccer should be ecstatic about this. Waking up at the buttcrack of dawn to catch weekend-morning soccer across the Atlantic truly sucks. But no excuses to miss the USWNT, as all of the Women’s World Cup matches will be played within the pacific and central timezones, and the U.S. Women will play their Group Stages matches in primetime on the East Coast.

For Gandhi, that something was ""the moral consequences"" of what we eat. Fast-forward 80 years and I'm just back from Vida Vegan Con, where vegans take their passion and advocacy to the next level -- the economy, or rather, the v-conomy.Compassion will always be a vegan cornerstone, but that translates these days not just about loving animals (we do) but about meeting people where they're at. Morality makes people edgy. Just try appealing to a beef-lovin' bubba or a brisket-baking bubbie about higher purpose, and good luck making a convert. Now the focus is the v-conomy -- making a living from what has pretty much till now been a lifestyle -- being vegan. That's where we make change happen on a broader level. You don't buy the vegan arguments for health, the environment and animal welfare? Fine, just buy the vegan cupcakes and vegan wine.Wanna get rich? Invest. Enterprising entities are backing vegan cheese, vegan meat, and vegan mayo. They're doing it not out of ethics, but because these are in-demand products and they're getting a good return on their investment.The v-conomy is a growing field, and unlike our current economic system, it's sustainable as a business model and does the planet and all the creatures on it a nice turn, as well. It's still a business, though, and succeeding in the v-conomy requires being equal parts soldier, crusader and town crier. It's not enough to have a better (more compassionate, more delicious, more sustainable) vegan product or service, you gotta get the word out -- a challenge in our crowded marketplace and cyberspace. The v-conomy's secret and affordable weapon is vegan messaging, via social media. Thanks to The Sexy Vegan, Eco-Vegan Gal,Vegan Yak Attack and all whose VVC workshops may yet help me get beyond being a social media embarrassment (I'll up my Instagram, I promise).I would like to make a living at being vegan but like Gandhi, I became one for the environment, for the animals, for love. There was a lot of love at Vida Vegan Con among a lot of driven, fun, inspiring vegans. Whether we're doing it for business or pleasure, Miyoko's Kitchen creator Miyoko Schinner exhorts us to fly our vegan banner high. Yes, vegan products, like vegan people, are healthy, natural and can compete with what's out there in the conventional but unsustainable marketplace, but let's call them -- and us -- what we are.

20,WOMEN,The Danger Of 'It Wasn't Really Rape',"Pamela Jacobs, ContributorSpeaker, author, advocate, and attorney helping women reclaim ...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-danger-of-it-wasnt-really-rape_b_7519454.html,"Jim Bob claims that, ""This wasn't rape or anything like that. This was touching over the clothes."" This perception that touching is somehow less traumatic than penetration is not only false, it is incredibly damaging to victims, and helps perpetuate a culture of victim-blaming.",2015-06-08,"Josh Duggar, executive director of FRC Action, speaks in favor the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act at the Arkansas state Capitol in Little Rock, Ark., Friday, Aug. 29, 2014. (AP Photo/Danny Johnston)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb60510200000c50100f6f8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I watched in horror along with most of America as ""19 Kids and Counting"" parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar talked about their son, Josh's, molestation of their young daughters. Josh has admitted to sexually abusing five young girls, including his sisters, Jessa and Jill. And a recently-released police report shows that Josh told his father on three occasions that he sexually abused four of his sisters as well as a family friend. Yet, horrifically, Jim Bob claims that, ""This wasn't rape or anything like that. This was touching over the clothes."" This perception that touching is somehow less traumatic that penetration is not only false, it is incredibly damaging to victims, and helps perpetuate a culture of victim-blaming and lack of accountability for perpetrators. The fact is that children who are sexually abused often face lifelong consequences, whether or not that abuse involved penetration. Each victim's experience and response is unique, but common impacts of child sexual abuse include guilt, shame, depression, sleep disorders, difficulty trusting, low self-esteem, flashbacks, disassociation, eating disorders, substance abuse and difficulty forming intimate relationships. And, as the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network states, ""The reaction of a survivor's friends and family to the disclosure of the abuse also has the potential to trigger immense feelings of guilt, shame and distrust, particularly if those individuals denied that the abuse was taking place, or chose to ignore it."" Disbelief and minimization by family members is often very re-traumatizing to victims, and can make the impact of the abuse far worse and longer lasting. I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse. And for me, my family's reaction was as painful and destructive as the abuse itself. I was 15 years old when I disclosed sexual abuse by a family member -- my step-grandfather. Like many victims, my disclosure was first met with disbelief. My grandmother told me I was lying and kicked me out of the house. Years later, as I tried to rebuild connections with my family, my mother eventually admitted that she believed me, and knew I was telling the truth. But, she said that I should ""just get over it,"" since ""it's not like he raped you or anything."" This ""it wasn't really rape"" claim is one of the most damaging forms of victim-blaming and minimization. It causes victims to doubt their own feelings and memories, and to feel ashamed for being so hurt by the abuse. In my experience, while it is true that there had not been penetration (that I remember), I was violated by someone whom I loved and trusted -- as were Josh Duggar's sisters. This type of betrayal is just as painful as rape by a stranger, sometimes more so. In fact, two years after I left home, I was raped by an acquaintance in college. And while this act did involve penetration and was very traumatic, it did not have the same lasting impact on me as the abuse by my grandfather. The specific act that was committed is not as important as the impact it created. This is not at all intended to downplay the impact of rape by a stranger, acquaintance or anyone else. All sexual assault is traumatic. Each victim's experience is unique, and each reaction will be different. It's impossible to say what type of sexual violence is worse or will be more damaging. And that's truly not up to us to decide. The fact is that any sexual touching or behavior without someone's consent, or before someone is old enough to consent, is sexual assault. Period. All perpetrators need to be held accountable. And all victims need to be believed and supported. I have worked with survivors of sexual abuse for 15 years. And many of the survivors I speak with are afraid to come forward because they have been told that what happened to them was ""not really rape."" They doubt their own definition of their own experience, because they have been told they are overreacting. We have to stop diluting rape and telling victims that only some acts are bad enough to justify outrage. We have to stop trying to define someone's experience for them, because we simply don't want to -- or can't handle -- the painful truth. All sexual assault is wrong, painful, damaging and illegal. Jessa, Josh's younger sister and one of his victims, is defending her brother. She has stated that referring to Josh as a child molester is ""so overboard and a lie."" It doesn't matter whether Jessa sees -- or is ready to see -- her brother as a perpetrator. The fact is that what he did is not just a ""mistake,"" as his parents claim, it was a crime -- multiple crimes. Sending him away to work for a summer is not an adequate punishment. It will not change his behavior. And it certainly will not help his sisters, and other victims, heal. I cannot imagine how agonizing it must be to know that several of your daughters were sexually abused, and the perpetrator is your own son. I am sure this is very difficult for the entire Duggar family. And I imagine the desire to defend their son is strong, as it would be for any parent. But, to defend one child at the expense of your other children is tragic and unacceptable. Children (and adults) who are sexually abused or assaulted need to know that they are believed, that the abuse was not their fault, and that they have support from friends and family. Having your experience validated is one of the most important steps toward healing and surviving. I can only hope that Jill, Jessa, and the other victims receive this support from someone, if not from their own parents, very soon. To Jessa, Jill, and all survivors of all forms of sexual violence: I believe you. It was not your fault. And you are not alone. If you or someone you know has been sexually abused, the National Sexual Assault Hotline is available 24 hours a day at 1-800-656-HOPE (4673)."
21,COLLEGE,What Emma's Mattress Means For Medicine,"Jes Minor, ContributorCritical observer, social justice advocate, anthropologist & p...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-emmas-mattress-means-for-medicine_b_7511140.html,"I am a medical student, yes.

Sulkowicz has said she is committed to carrying the mattress everywhere she goes until the university expels the rapist or he leaves. The protest is also doubling as her senior thesis project. (Photo by Andrew Burton/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae59552100002501c6d4cd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I am a medical student, yes. I am also a survivor of sexual violence. With the recent Columbia University commencement, the surge of articles surrounding the narratives of Emma Sulkowickz and Paul Nungesser prompted me to reflect on this latter identity. When histories of sexual harassment at my school emerged last November, my survivor status edged its way into my path toward doctorhood. I know I will always carry the mark of my trauma with me, and I am learning how I will better empathize with patients because of it.Reading about a Yale professor using his erections to harass female colleagues hurtled me back to a moment when something similar happened to me. That day, I was the only one of my college freshman peers to appear at our group problem-solving session. While we were alone, my peer mentor urged me to touch his genitals and to have a sexual relationship with him. I resisted, and he masturbated in front of me, again pushing me to feel him.Like Sulkowicz, I waited to report. Like Sulkowicz, I attempted to obscure my horror through amicable message exchanges after the incident -- a fact that haunted me two years later when his case coordinator cited a smiley face I used in an email as evidence that I was ""fine."" Like Sulkowicz, this need to defend myself frustrated me; I felt unprepared, despite spending months overcoming my denial, shame, and fear.Fear ultimately drove me to come forward: I feared if I said nothing, it might happen to someone else. Sulkowicz, in her demand for attention to university management of sexual misconduct, has mobilized dialogue and policy action on issues of sexual violence. This is a critical step in responding to cases -- what people in the health care world call ""tertiary care.""But what is the primary care for sexual violence? This is where, I hope, my identity as a survivor becomes an advantage.In my view, primary care for sexual violence takes the form of understanding. It is the awareness that sexual violence is ubiquitous and detrimental to health -- both physical and mental. In the two years between the incident and the day I reported, my trauma had taken the shape of a snarling monster under my bed. I could wrestle it into the shadows, but while I ignored it, that monster only grew bigger and more eager to terrorize my dreams.Once I started speaking with a counselor, I began to feel I could fight this vicious creature, my trauma. Knowing that yes, my experience was awful and that it was okay to not be okay -- to ask for help and to take it -- made me feel less like some knight trying to keep her trembling knees from rattling her armor and more like a person with real problems. Clinicians can have this power, if they choose. By using intentional language, asking questions with confidence and sensitivity, and respecting reticence, providers can offer immense relief to survivors in what might otherwise constitute an anxiety-provoking situation.For instance, while teaching the pelvic exam, our instructors demonstrated language that avoids potential triggers for survivors. They told us to call it an exam table, not a bed; a drape, not a sheet; and said, we examine -- we don't feel. This, to me, is intuitive. The thought of cowering naked on a cold vinyl table, covering myself with a crimped paper blanket while a stranger, especially a man, tells me, ""Okay, I'm just going to lift this sheet and feel inside"" sends my heart rate surging. For my classmates who, thankfully, never acquired this instinct, such training ensures we all consider the vulnerabilities of some future patients.For the many who will not perform regular pelvic exams, the sexual history can form a keystone of rapport construction. While we need to ask about patients' partners, the kind of sex they have (oral, anal, vaginal), whether they use protection and, if applicable, contraception, we should avoid questions that are clinically unnecessary. Asking about the mechanics by which a transman has sex -- or, in Sulkowicz's case, about the positions used during a possible sexual assault -- reflects intrigue more than insight into risk factors. These ""curiosity questions"" may provoke distrust of the provider, which can hinder health care.By contrast, the sexual history can segue into positive conversation on consensual sex and healthy relationships. While screening for intimate partner violence, we can ask, ""Has your partner ever forced you to have sex, or continue to have sex, when you didn't want to?"" Questions like these normalize the experience of sexual assault and can help connect survivors with support. Now, patients may say ""no"" to that question and still bite their lips or blink away tears. We can name what we see (""It looks like you're fighting back some tears right now. Is something upsetting you?""), and we can offer resources. But we should never force someone to share an experience they would rather conceal. Sometimes respecting their silence and giving them the choice to come forward, or not, is the most empowering thing we can do.While I can't ignore the thud that rocks my chest when I see the words ""sexual harassment"" or ""sexual assault"" in a national headline, I am heartened that these issues are garnering the attention they deserve. I hope the conversations stirred by Emma's statement broaden the burden of responsibility for caring for sexual violence to policymakers, to educators, to parents, and to clinicians. You can look at me in my white coat and never know that I once passed hours sobbing in my college dorm room, mucus streaming down my quivering lips, unable to leave or go to class for fear of the man who violated me. But if you know what that's like, I hope if I meet you in my clinic someday, I treat you in a way that says, ""I'm sorry. What happened to you was not okay, and you don't have to be alone."""
