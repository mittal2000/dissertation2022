Would you like to have your not-so-flat stomach constantly analyzed for a bump? What about having your 9 month outfits reviewed by fashion experts? Think about how much judgement new moms feel over things like natural childbirth vs. c-sections. Can you imagine having your birth plan come up for conversation on Good Morning America?There's no doubt that all of this will happen to Kate, Duchess of Cambridge. Interestingly, though, her world-famous pregnancy will also have the affect of drawing increased scrutiny to commoners, who just happen to be pregnant at the same time. Many of these women are used to the extra eyes. After all, they got married around the same time as Kate as well.Heather Lynne Vickery of Greatest Expectations Event Planning in Chicago is in a unique position to see this effect. As an event planner, she saw how the royal wedding both inspired and intimidated engaged couples.""Well, it isn't the royal wedding, but it will still be nice,"" was a common phrase for weddings in 2011.Currently, though, Vickery also happens to be pregnant and, like Kate, she suffers from hyperemesis gravidarum. Unlike Kate, this isn't new for Vickery, it's her fourth child and her fourth bout with the debilitating illness. ""I can't say it makes it any easier knowing that she's going through it, too, I feel bad for her, but at least now people understand what I'm talking about,"" says Vickery.Kim, a graphic designer, got engaged in January 2011, shortly after Will and Kate. She says that because she's older, not as rich and not as thin as Kate, she didn't take too much wedding inspiration from the royal couple. But, she feels that the royals may be indirectly responsible for her not receiving a sapphire engagement ring. Kim believes a sapphire was her husband's original plan, but that it was derailed by Will and Kate making the idea too trendy (Kim's husband denies this and Kim also hastens to add that she loves the ring that she does have). Kim is also now pregnant and finds it odd, but sort of fun, to be on the same path as the royal couple.The connection pregnant women feel to Kate makes perfect sense to Julia Beck, owner of Forty Weeks, a marketing agency that specializes in maternity businesses. ""The bond between new and expectant mothers is quite essential and empowering -- creating community and building confidence. It is this feeling of connection and care that builds confidence in expectant mothers that is uniquely bolstered by having their very own Princess of Pregnancy at the helm,"" says Beck.Of course, many newly pregnant moms may feel less ""bolstered"" and more ""pressured"" by being compared to a pregnant princess. I was pregnant in a much-less celebrity-pressured time and was still brought to tears one day by a perfect nursery layout in a catalog that I could never afford (hey, hormones, remember).For many people, being a parent touches on all sorts of anxieties about income and status. We all want to do the best for our children. As much as we may logically know that ""the best"" doesn't necessarily involve money, it's hard to remember that when faced with page after page of perfectly decorated baby rooms, supplies and parties.But, one of the many advantages of NOT being the Duchess of Cambridge and the future Queen of England is that your every pregnant and new-mom moment is not being documented by the world. Your baby's room does not have to be magazine-ready every minute of the day, because no one but your sister-in-law is going to analyze it and make snarky comments. Do you feel a bond to the royal pregnancy or does it make you feel pressured? Share your thoughts in the comments."
1,TRAVEL,Soul-Searching: Travel Can Improve Your Life,"Kate Thomas, Contributor

No. Travel has taught me that it is a great teacher.",2012-12-20,2012-12-17-TravelwithKate.Travelisthelureofbecoming.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-12-17-TravelwithKate.Travelisthelureofbecoming.png,"Lately, I have been watching Super Soul Sunday, Oprah's show on OWN. I find it to be outstanding and inspiring beyond any expectations I have for television these days. Her guests range from Eckhart Tolle and Deepak Chopra to Gabrielle Bernstein and Eli Wiesel expand my mind in every episode.A few weeks ago, there was something said that keeps popping up into my head. Oprah asked Jean Houston, ""What is your definition of the soul?"" Her answer, ""the lure of our becoming.""As soon as I heard that, I said to myself, ""That is the definition of travel, to me. I travel for the lure of becoming the best, most true version of myself.""Let me explain. I agree with Jean Houston about her definition of the soul, and I believe the soul is our true self, hidden within, gauzed by our thoughts and emotions and relationships with the perceived world around us. And sometimes, we are able to consciously connect with that true self.For some, it may simply happen when we feel a nagging sense of intuition that something is not right or needs to be changed. Or what about those private moments when we ponder secret dreams of ours that we haven't shared with anyone else?It is very important to pay attention to those moments because, as many spiritual thinkers have expressed, it is aligning one's life with the soul's purpose that will bring true contentment. I'm sure you've heard people describe something as ""what they where born to do.""But man, it can be hard to figure out what our soul's purpose actually is. Not all of us are lucky enough to know. And some of us find it much later in life. Others may feel like they found it too late. Many never find it at all. Do you know what your soul's purpose is?I recently discovered mine. (It is really exciting to actually type that out!)I have not chosen travel media as a career because I simply want to have a fun time, live the travel dream or live selfishly. No. Travel has taught me that it is a great teacher. And it has taught me that my soul's purpose is to help others see that -- to help others reach their soul's purpose by tapping into the well of knowledge that is travel.Actively seeking your soul's purpose takes courage and openness, but most of all it takes action. Because, if it doesn't pop up naturally for you, you can look for it. Some people search through meditation, prayer, yoga, art, dance or playing music. In those moments we are there, flush against our inner knowing.But often times that state of being or the lessons learned while engaging in those activities don't stick once we are faced with the world around us. Our interactions with moms and dads, and bosses; having to pay the bills; having to raise the children; having to fit in to society and live up to expectations; those can all be distractions from your inner knowing.In order to make a breakthrough, a shift is necessary. A shake. A jolt. And that is so easy to find when you travel. It is connecting with other human beings in another part of the world -- person to person and soul to soul -- that shakes us to the core and allows us to glimpse the infinite nature of our world and the limitless possibilities that are there for us.Travel is my prayer, my meditation. It is the shedding of what is on the outside to see what is within. What makes travel so exciting is that it provides freedom and space to see with bigger and clearer eyes.So if you haven't uncovered your soul's purpose, travel is a way to accelerate the search. It is the lure and the bridge that can enable you to become your true self.Come visit my site at Travelwithkate.com!"

And not until we treat this matter as the national crisis that it is.We simply cannot continue to cut access to mental health services and expect positive outcomes. We cannot ignore current deficiencies in our mental health and care systems. We can no longer treat Americans' mental health well-being as less important than their physical health. We must decide as a society to end the stigma against those with mental health and behavioral problems. The reality is that we are in dire need of systemic change that includes prevention programs from coast to coast; innovations in early identification and treatments; aggressive outreach and programming for youth at risk; legitimate, non-judgmental support for parents; and open-door policies that welcome those with unmet mental health needs.  We also need mental health funding, attached to an assortment of policies so the issue is ever-present -- in school funding; in health care, thanks in part to the Affordable Healthcare Act; and in gun control via stricter background checks.Join me in appealing to public officials and advocates on all sides with demands for action and solutions.

For me, tree-trimming is an occasion for some over-the-top fun. Whatever the tradition means for you, here are some tips to make your tree a beautiful and stylish centerpiece for holiday celebrations.How to make your Christmas tree memorable and fun!Go ahead -- get the big tree (you know you want to):  Without fail, kids always want to pick the biggest tree in the lot. You know what? They're right: in this case bigger is better. Choosing a tree that's oversized for the space it's meant to stand in gives it an irresistible, look-at-me presence.Go beyond traditional colors:  Red and green? Well, the tree gets you halfway there -- so what else are you going to do? For my tree, I've chosen a palette of bold, modish colors. For your tree, don't feel bound by tradition - -put your favorite colors on display!Lights do more than twinkle:  Lights bring your tree to life. If you use different size lights, as I've done here, you can also give an added sense of depth to your tree's branches. Wind larger and brighter bulbs around closer to the trunk and inner branches in addition to draping smaller bulbs over the outer boughs. Of course - the goal is always to hide the cords and show the lights.Divide and conquer:  Use oversized ribbons and ornaments to divide the tree into three or four zones -- I've used hot pink pinecone wreaths, but any big, bold ornaments will do. This gives the tree various focal points to guide the eye.Ornaments -- work your way up:  Once you've established your zones, give your tree an overall sense of balance and structure by generally placing larger ornaments on the lower branches and smaller ornaments up top.Save the best for last:  We all have a few ornaments with special meaning -- the ones that were presents or that have been handed down from grandma's tree with the greatest of care. Add these last, in places where they'll have a chance to be seen and admired.Have fun:  Understatement? You must be thinking of another holiday. Christmas is a celebration of light and wonder amid winter's dark. Decorate your tree accordingly, and don't be afraid to break these and any other ""rules"" you might imagine are holding you back. Start a new tradition today!Read Matthew's post on How to Have the Wedding of Your Dreams!"
6,MONEY,Helping Newtown: How To Avoid Charity Hoaxes Post-Tragedy,Caroline Fairchild,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/helping-newtown-charity-hoaxes_us_5b9ca701e4b03a1dcc809663,Here are some tips on how to avoid charity scams: Be skeptical of charities that only collect cash: If a charity seems eager,2012-12-20,"Stephanie Venable holds close her 6-year-old daughter Sierra Venable Wednesday, Dec. 19, 2012, in Panama City, Fla., during a memorial service for the Newtown school shooting. (AP Photo/News Herald, Heather Leiphart)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca7012000003100fda8c1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Trying to profit off someone's pain is a unique form of evil, but unfortunately it is not unheard of after tragedies like the Newtown school massacre. Less than a week after the shooting in Newtown, Conn., a stranger to 6-year-old victim Noah Pozner attempted to collect money in his memory, the AP reports. The scammer even had a website listing information about Noah’s funeral and various petitions on gun control. But the address listed for sending donations was located in the Bronx, N.Y., at a location that the Pozner family had never heard of.""These scammers are stealing from the families of victims of this horrible tragedy,"" Alexis Haller, Noah’s uncle, told the AP.Unfortunately, in the wake of the second-deadliest school shooting in U.S. history, the Pozner’s aren’t alone when it comes to scammers using their personal tragedy to turn a profit. Connecticut officials are warning residents of possible scams and encouraged people to be careful about donating to charities, CBS New York reported.Also on Wednesday, the Better Business Bureau Serving Western Michigan alerted people of multiple reports of illegitimate charity solicitations that say they are for victims' families in Newtown. Some scam artists are even using fake Facebook pages to solicit donations, according to a screenshot shared on the blog Not Before Coffee.A rise in charity hoaxes after tragedies like the Newtown massacre is nothing new. Scammers reportedly tried to take advantage after the shooting in Aurora, Colo., the shooting at Columbine High School and even after 9/11.Here are some tips on how to avoid charity scams:Do your research: The Better Business Bureau advises researching each charity when considering donations on the bureau's website, give.org.  Check with state regulators: The National Association of State Charity Officials has information on its website specific to each state.  Avoid unfamiliar websites: Given advances in technology that allow scammers to be just a click away from collecting your money, the Better Business Bureau also suggests contacting charities directly before sending over money.Request information in writing: Avoid donating to a charity that approaches you on the street or tries to give you information over the phone. Getting information in writing is a great test to see if the charity really is legitimate, the American Institute Of Philanthropy says.Be wary of charities with similar-sounding names: Often times charity scam artists will choose a name that is similar to the name of a legitimate charity on the chance that donors will mistake the hoax for the real deal, Business Insider reports.Be skeptical of charities that only collect cash: If a charity seems eager to get your money immediately and will only take cash, you should be wary of how legitimate the charity really is, BI also said.Avoid ""we're going to help the victims and families"": Vague fundraising claims on the part of charities should immediately put up a red flag, Bennett Weiner, chief operating officer of the BBB Wise Giving Alliance, told ABC News"

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca82c24000051005348e0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Five days have passed and I am still finding it nearly impossible to comprehend the events of 12/14 in Newtown, Conn. I am an experienced clinical social worker who specializes in the treatment of psychological trauma, yet I am still at a loss in understanding what happened on that hideous day.When working with a client in therapy to help them heal from a traumatic event, one of my goals is to help them create a coherent narrative about what happened. A coherent narrative is essentially a story that makes sense.A coherent narrative is one of the things that helps us to integrate new information with what we already know, so that we can heal and move on.For example, if I were working with a little girl who is stuck in grief six months after her beloved grandmother died, we would write a story about what happened. In this example, her grandmother lived with the family, and cared for the girl while her parents were at work. Her parents would be invited in to help her write the story about how much the little girl loved her grandma, and how much the grandma loved her. We would include in the story the things they used to like to do together, like going to the park and making cookies. The story would continue with the grandmother getting sick, the girl visiting grandmother in the hospital, grandmother dying, and the girl attending the funeral. Perhaps we might end the story with a drawing of something that grandma gave to the girl, an object that the child can keep to remember her with.This would help the child process her grief so that she can be free to be a child again, while still retaining memories of her beloved. Psychologically, she has successfully internalized her grandmother's love so it stays with her.The Newtown tragedy continues to trouble me personally, and us collectively, because it is so difficult to formulate a coherent narrative around the events of that day.Why has it been so difficult to do so? Perhaps it is because it is just too tragic. Perhaps it is because too many innocents died. Perhaps it is so difficult for me personally because it hits too close to my home in Milford, Conn.Or maybe, just maybe, the reason I am not able to form a coherent narrative around these events is because there is none. This story does not make sense, no matter which angle you view it from. Perhaps there will be continue to be no coherent narrative until the laws are changed about what kind of firearms individuals are allowed to own.The idea that a potentially mentally unstable young man could so easily obtain the weapons necessary to kill so many innocents in so little time makes no sense. The idea that his mother could legally own an assault rifle capable of killing so many in so little time makes no sense. The idea that the rights of a few outweigh the rights of the rest of us makes no sense. There is no coherence here, and that is why my brain can't integrate this new information.How do you help a child who has suffered a loss?Right now in Newtown, parents are struggling with what to say to their children. What might you say to a child, for example, who lost a classmate in this situation? To help them form a coherent narrative, the story must first and foremost be true. Children are experts at reading non-verbal communication, and most of our communication is non-verbal. If you doubt their expertise in this, think about how your child often knows when to push (or when not to push) for a later bedtime, or a coveted toy.It is of paramount importance that the information you do share is true. If the information you give them is not true they will notice that your words and body language don't match. They will sense its incongruence, which will just confuse them.The information should be tailored to their age and developmental level. Older children generally need more information than younger children. It is not necessary to tell them everything. It is wiser to leave out gory details.An excellent example of a coherent message is what first-grade teacher Kaitlin Roig said to her students, who were in hiding with her in a barricaded bathroom. She told her students, ""We have to be absolutely quiet. There are bad guys are out there now, and we need to wait for the good guys to come get us out.""It is perfectly crafted because it was true, it was in their benefit to receive that information at that time, and the language was tailored to fit what children of that age could comprehend.So, one might say to a child who lost a classmate in the tragedy that something truly awful has happened. Don't sugarcoat this. They already know that something awful has happened. The surviving children are reading the trauma that is registering on the faces of many of the adults that they encounter.*It is better to tell them what really happened because in the absence of accurate information the children might imagine a story that is even worse.You might say something like this: ""A very disturbed man came to the school and killed some children and the grown-ups who were trying to protect them. Nobody knows why he did this. It is a mystery to the grown-ups, who are all trying very hard to understand what happened.""The good guys came to help as soon as they could. They were able to save most of the people in the school. But not everybody survived. Some children, and some grown-ups, died.""The grown-ups know that it is their job to protect children, and everybody who hears about this is very sad because in this case it just wasn't possible. They are all heartbroken, and very sorry for what has happened.""The grown-ups know that what happened is not acceptable. They know that this must never happen again, so they are doing everything possible to make sure that this will not happen again.""The only way I can formulate a coherent narrative about this tragedy is if all of us, collectively, use this event as a catalyst for change. If this event results in a changes in how firearms are regulated in this country, and a change in how much tolerance we have for all forms of violence in our society, then -- and only then -- will this story make sense to me.*based on the work of Peter G.

Quite simply, I broke my own rule because I want to see a smile on my mom's face this holiday. Normally, Christmas Day would start with dad awake before the rest of us, banging on our doors and begging us to get out of bed and start the opening of presents. He would gleefully serve as the master of ceremonies, handing out gifts and making sure that we went in turns and all oohed and ahhed over the gifts, all while wearing his tinkling reindeer slippers. Dad is no longer here, and though there is not much that I can do to ease any of our pain, I can make my mom and my sister happy, if only for a moment, by splurging on clothes and accessories.Materialistic? Yes. Taking part in an overly commercialized holiday? Possibly. But selfishly, I don't care. If increasing my credit card debt for one month means that my mom and sister get to rip into packages of new shoes, bags and beauty products, then I'll work extra hours to pay off my bills. This year, all rules go out the window as we do our best as a family to hold each other up in a tough time. Next year, I'll stick to my budget. Maybe. Until then, check out a few of the fab items that I chose for my favorite ladies. Want more?

10,WELLNESS,Compassion Born From Tragedy,"Michael Stanclift, ND, Contributor

If we acknowledge that we're likely to make poor decisions in these states, it's easier to find the motivation to let these emotions go.",2012-12-20,"A Newtown, Conn., resident, who declined to give her name, sits at an intersection holding a sign for passing motorists up the road from the Sandy Hook Elementary School, Saturday, Dec. 15, 2012, in Newtown, Conn. The massacre of 26 children and adults at Sandy Hook Elementary school elicited horror and soul-searching around the world even as it raised more basic questions about why the gunman, 20-year-old Adam Lanza, would have been driven to such a crime and how he chose his victims. (AP Photo/David Goldman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca6e926000035007f9079.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In light of the recent tragedy in Connecticut, I'm compelled to share with you, dear reader, my experiences. I hope that you might use them as a stepping stone to your own mental freedom.Death is always a tough thing for us to deal with. Even when it comes to someone who has long been suffering, it's hard for us to accept that we'll no longer be creating memories with the ones we've lost. Tragic death is an even tougher circumstance for us to cope with, both mentally and emotionally. By ""tragic death,"" I'm referring to when someone dies ""before their time,"" deaths we don't see coming. We have no time to prepare for their impact, and they often disrupt our lives to a greater degree than a death we saw on the horizon.Earlier this year, my social circle experienced a similar tragedy to the recent shooting in Connecticut. A cafe where my friends worked and hung out, a place I often popped into to grab a cup of joe, had a disturbed gunman come in on a murderous rampage. Several friends perished. Later that day, the gunman took his own life, circumventing any hopes we had that justice would be served. In reality, there was no way we would have felt compensated for the loss of our friends.A few months later, another mass shooting occurred, at the opening night of the Batman movie. Though I didn't know any victims there, I empathize with their friends and family. And now the news of two more mass shootings (one in Portland, the other in Newtown), challenges our thoughts and emotions again.The first thing most of us think is: ""What motivates someone do something like that?"" There's no rational way to answer this question. It's foolish to think something like this results from any kind of logical thinking. Often we wonder if we could have prevented what happened, but that's futile too. Though we can make changes now, dwelling on the past is pointless, because we can't go back.So what can we do? How can we return our minds to peace? My answer to these questions is to practice compassion and forgiveness with everyone. I know, it's easier said than done. I'm no saint. But I know connecting with and acting from compassion is an immediate release from confusion and frustration. Actively forgiving is a long, lasting release from anger and resentment. To return to peace we must use compassion and forgiveness as the guide for our actions with ourselves and toward others, especially in the circumstances we find it most challenging.Anger, confusion, and frustration can be important signals to us, but they are poor states to make decisions from and notoriously awful for guiding our actions. It goes without saying that we don't want to be in these emotions for extended periods of time. If we continually make decisions and act from these feelings, we generally end up in circumstances we regret.The important part of this is moving beyond just thinking nice thoughts, or thinking we're nice people and start (or continue) acting that way. Especially to people who piss us off! When situations or people challenge us, we need to identify that we're angry, confused, or frustrated. If we acknowledge that we're likely to make poor decisions in these states, it's easier to find the motivation to let these emotions go.Our next move forward is to find our compassion (believe me, it's in there somewhere). When we come from a place of compassion, we identify with our highest potential as humans and amazing things emerge. Even simple, seemingly-small deeds can have huge impacts on us and others from this intention. If we acknowledge that all humans (in fact, all sentient beings) want to be free from fear and confusion, and exist in happiness, we can empathize with those who are seemingly different. Even the ones who cause us grief and pain wish to be happy, though they may be confused in their ways of finding happiness.My challenge to you, my wonderful reader, is to practice compassion not only in your most challenging affairs, but in the times when you feel indifferent, too. Of course, practice compassion with those you love and who mean the world to you as well! But don't forget the ones you don't care about, and the ones who get on your nerves. They are here to teach you valuable lessons too, the kind of lessons that take effort and make you feel like a better person for doing.There it is. Give it a think, try it out, see what happens.I wish it didn't take tragedy for me to write such things, but maybe it does. Hopefully, with some practice it won't take a disaster to remind ourselves to act this way, all the time.Thanks for reading.For more by Michael Stanclift, N.D., click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."

Photo courtesy of Daniel Valverde.I recently had the opportunity to be the guest speaker at a Model Clinic in North Carolina as part of an event held by the Breast Cancer Awareness organization Pink Soles. I have spoken at many model clinics before, and I really love having the opportunity to share the knowledge that I have gained over the last several years with other young men and women. So many young people across the nation are eagerly trying to pursue a career in the fashion industry, specifically as a model. And they just don't know where to begin.I thought that it would be really cool to include some of the key topics I share at these model clinics here on my blog! Here is the first installment of my model tips for young aspiring models.***Maintaining a healthy body.It is so very important for a model to maintain his or her health. We work in a very physically demanding profession and what we bring to the table, besides our charm and charisma, is in fact our physique. When we eat a healthy, well-rounded diet and exercise regularly, our bodies perform to their maximum potential. I mention this in my book Model Behavior.As models, we have to be very conscience of what we eat. Consider researching raw foods and replacing animal fat with other forms of protein like soy-based products and grains like quinoa. Juicing is amazing, as well, because it delivers a nutrients from fruits and vegetables directly to your stomach to be absorbed by the body.Food is the energy we fuel our bodies with. When we fuel them with the best kinds of foods, our bodies will naturally react in a positive way. Our skin becomes radiant, our hair shines, toxins are more readily removed from our systems and we gain so much more energy!Beyond the physical benefits, eating healthily and exercising regularly actually improves our mood. Think about all the time you've had a bad stomach ache, and how irritable it can make you. When those ailments don't exist anymore, we have room to actually feel good.What this does for your career is this: The hardest part of modeling, in my opinion, is booking the job. When we go to castings and go-sees, we need to present ourselves in the best way we can. The client wants to see the best version of you as possible. I can't you tell the number of times I've gone to see a client, and after looking at my book they scrutinize over my face and say, ""This is a great portfolio, and you have great skin!""The client wants to make sure there is a natural glow to your skin, something that cannot be added by Photoshop. They also want to make sure they do not have to pay a photo editor for hours spent in retouching your skin. With a glowing face and a radiant personality, you've booked the job! At that point, you just need maintain your regimen so that when you arrive on set you can continue performing your best!There is a stigma in the fashion industry that models do not eat. A lot of models actually think they must literally starve themselves to attain a model's physique, especially when they start out in their careers. We are who we are and we must respect the bodies that we are blessed to have. For example, I will never be a size zero -- or double zero at that. It's just not in my genetic makeup to be that size. My natural size is a size two, and I have learned to respect that and cater to my body's specific needs.Eating healthily and keeping up a good exercise regimen gets you in shape. It helps you to maintain a lean physical appearance, as a toned healthy young person without having to result to drastic measures (that can actually harm your body) to stay thin. It is a part of a model's job to stay lean and thin, but it is possible to do this in a healthy way.

Here are some tips that will make your journey more fun -- and less of the wrong kind of ""adventure.""",2012-12-20,2012-12-17-TopMoscowTravelTipsLotteMoscowAtriumRoom.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-12-17-TopMoscowTravelTipsLotteMoscowAtriumRoom.jpg,"Moscow is one of the largest cities that may still, in the minds of many Westerners, seem to qualify as ""adventure travel"" thanks to the combination of mafia portrayals in Hollywood movies and the unrelenting bad press in Western media. Take it all with a huge grain of salt, and don't let it dissuade you from exploring Moscow's many cultural wonders, from top-notch exhibits at the Tretyakov Gallery to some of the world's most gorgeous subway stations replete with stained glass, marble and intricate mosaics.1. Apply for your Russian visa three months before your arrival date. You can't apply earlier than three months for it, but you also don't want to wait until the last minute due to processing times. For a step by step guide, see Three-Year Russian Visa Application Requirements and Tips2. Fly first class to Moscow on a Lufthansa or Singapore Airlines award ticket. Treat yourself to some luxury even before you get to Russia by flying Lufthansa New First Class to Moscow via Germany (67,500 United miles each way), or Singapore Airlines First Class from Houston to Moscow, using KrisFlyer miles. 3. Take the Aeroexpress to and from the airport. There's really no reason to haggle with taxi drivers, since the Aeroexpress train takes even less time between the airport and Moscow city center, and you can connect to the Metro at Paveletskaya to get to wherever you need to go (just pack light).4. Where to Stay, Luxury: For modern luxury, stay at The Lotte Hotel Moscow. It's no wonder the hotel was named the best city hotel in Russia in the 2012 Conde Nast Traveller Readers' Choice Awards and has quickly become a favorite among both discerning business travelers and well-heeled Muscovites alike. The attention to detail and consistently high quality service at The Lotte is still a relative rarity in Moscow. And don't miss stellar French cuisine at Les Menus par Pierre Gagnaire, or a soothing Balinese massage at Mandara Spa.5. Where to Stay, Budget: While there are Moscow hostels and rented apartments, your best bet for an almost-free stay that is still conveniently located in the center is to use loyalty points. Hyatt, Marriott, InterContinental and Radisson all have hotels in Moscow, so by earning points either with hotel stays or by signing up for the best travel credit cards, you can enjoy some free nights in one of the most expensive cities in the world.6. Try Georgian Food: Georgian food and wine was beloved during the Soviet Union and continues to be popular in Moscow. Try hip local chain Café Khachapuri which specializes in different varieties of the namesake khachapuri, a traditional Georgian bread stuffed with melted Georgian sulguni cheese. There are plenty of other Georgian dishes on offer as well. The business lunch special on weekdays is also a good deal. Check out some other great things to eat in Moscow.7. Take in the View: The City Space Bar, on the top floor of the Swissotel Krasnye Holmy, is your best bet for incredible 360-degree views of Moscow while sipping elegant and innovative (albeit very pricey) cocktails and excellent service. In the summer, another great place is the terrace of the Sky Lounge, located atop the Russian Academy of Sciences. Here, cocktails aren't as innovative as the City Space Bar but the food menu is far more extensive. Reserve a table here for just before sunset. Another option is the O2 Lounge atop the Ritz-Carlton Moscow, with its lovely view of Red Square and the Kremlin.8. Go Underground: Chances are, unless you've experienced other Russian or former Soviet subway systems, you've never seen more beautiful stations. Don't miss Novoslobodskaya, Komsomolskaya, Mayakovskaya and Ploschad Revolutsii, to name a few, whether you visit on your own or as part of a Moscow Metro Tour. Just as impressive is the subway's efficiency -- you'll often wait less than a minute for the next train to come.9. Go to Church: You'll probably visit Red Square and the Kremlin, but don't forget to buy a cathedral pass so that you can visit Uspensky Sobor, the masterpiece of Italian architect Aristotele Fioravanti and the coronation site of Russian monarchs from 1547 to 1896. Take in the beautiful frescos and icons, but note that photography isn't allowed inside. 10. Visit a Russian Versailles: Arkhangelskoe Estate takes a bit of getting to (take Metro Line 7 to Tushinskaya, then a 20-30 minute Number 151 mini-bus ride) but is well worth the trek on a beautiful summer or crisp autumn day. Take a picnic with you and enjoy walking around this Russian version of Versailles."

We're highlighting the lowest-ranking airports -- those with the most annoying security checkpoints -- and have researched the factors and headline-making incidents that may have contributed to readers' opinions.The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) is an easy scapegoat, and security expert Bruce Schneier understands the frustration with the federal agency. ""Airport security is just so focused on details like shoes or liquids, whatever the terrorists did last time. It's like saying, 'I'm worried about burglaries, so I'm gonna put all my effort on the third window on the left.'""""Early on, TSA had some real challenges that they really didn't understand, but I think they're doing a lot more right these days that people just don't see,"" counters Jeffrey Price, a professor of aerospace science at Denver's Metropolitan State University. He points to recent innovations like the PreCheck program for frequent flyers, risk-based screening and alternative screening procedures for passengers under 12 and over 75 years of age.Predicting and avoiding long airport security lines is becoming a science unto itself. The TSA has created an app where passengers can post airport security waiting times. But days and sometimes weeks go by between updates, making the app only marginally useful. Ifly.com posts average wait times for all major U.S. airports, broken down by checkpoint and time of day. But again, its times are estimates based on the TSA's historical averages, not what's happening in the given moment.And it's that continued uncertainty and inability to plan that travelers dread. --Joe YogerstSee the methodology and the most annoying airport security checkpoints.More From Travel + Leisure: America's Worst Airports for Flight Delays America's Most Family-Friendly Airports Worst Celebrity Air-Rage Incidents"

So why is it that when we are married, we work together as a team and when we divorce, we compete against one another? I realize that you aren't a ""team"" anymore. But aren't the players the same? Isn't the goal of raising happy, healthy and well-adjusted children still the same? It should be! It takes two people to play the ""divorced with kids"" competition and one person to stop it. You have to be the one to stop the competition before it gets out of hand and before you start recruiting new players -- like your children! After a while, children become wise to the competition between their parents and they start playing one parent against the other. Don't let this happen to you. Step one begins with looking at your situation in a different way. It isn't a competition for who can buy the most toys or clothes or fulfill the kids' every whim. It isn't a competition for love. Your children automatically love both of you. Ultimately, those toys will head to the Goodwill pile. Those clothes get passed down or a new trend will take over. The he said, she said routine your kids hear will set the stage for future therapy. Is this what you wanted for your children? Stop the madness. Set your focus back on your original goal: happy, healthy and well adjusted children. Resist the urge to compete with your ex. If junior shows up with the newest iPod, don't feel like you have to show your ex up by buying junior the newest iPad. Here are some tips to break your old competition habits: 1. Say Goodbye to Buying the Love: I know it's hard when your child always seems to come home with the latest and greatest whatever from your ex's house. Instead of thinking you have to buy something too -- stop. Save your money. Be happy that your child has something cool and ask him to take some time to show you how it works. Take time to see the new gadget and engage with your child. Your children will always remember the time you spent, not the gifts you gave. Ask any adult. 2. Forgo the Bragging Rights: It's tempting when the ex calls to tell you that he is going to be the first one to take the kids to Disney World. Your old first instinct would be to try to book the same trip for a week sooner, just so you can be the first. The new you won't do that because it's juvenile. Instead, be happy your children get to go on such a cool vacation. If you still feel the urge to do the Disney thing, take them another time and create your own memories. I promise you, your children won't like Disney just the first time. 3. Just Say Nothing: The old bite-your-tongue routine is tried and true and it works. Sometimes there is nothing you can do when your ex wants to keep the competition rolling. Your best move is to say nothing. Don't engage. Just smile and move on. After awhile, it won't be fun to compete with someone that doesn't play. There is one thing you should strive for: being there for your children. Be truly there for them. Be a listening ear. Be a shoulder to cry on. Create traditions and memories that don't compete with anyone. There is enough love to go around for everyone."
