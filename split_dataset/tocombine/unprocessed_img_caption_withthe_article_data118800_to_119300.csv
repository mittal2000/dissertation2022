Bowe Bergdahl during a press conference at Gouen Field national guard training facility on June 1, 2014 in Boise, Idaho. Sgt. Bergdahl who was captured in 2009 while serving with U.S. Armys 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment in Paktika Province, Afghanistan was released yesterday after a swap for Taliban prisoners. Bergdahl was considered the only U.S. prisoner of war held in Afghanistan.

Some of Bergdahl's former comrades have charged that he was captured in 2009 after deserting his post.U.S. military leaders have said the circumstances of Bergdahl's capture are unclear, with Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel urging critics to wait for all the facts to be known before rushing to judgment on Bergdahl.The threats came as Hailey, a tourist community of some 8,000 people in the mountains of central Idaho, was buffeted by hundreds of vitriolic phone calls and emails.The celebratory spirit that infused Hailey a week ago with news of Bergdahl's release turned to apprehension as an onslaught of angry messages were directed at city officials, businesses and friends of the Bergdahls over a hometown rally to mark his freedom planned for June 28.As many as 15,000 supporters and protesters were expected to descend on Hailey for an event that would have overwhelmed the resources and infrastructure of the remote mountain town and potentially risked public safety and property, city officials have said.Residents of the close-knit community have been surprised and dismayed by an angry backlash that seemed to fault them for seeking to aid the Bergdahls in a time of need, Gunter said.""We've always come together in tragedy or crisis, whether it be fire or one of our own being a prisoner of war. Whatever the problem is, the community will be there to help the people experiencing it,"" he said. (Editing by Dan Whitcomb and Paul Tait)"
1,POLITICS,"Run, Ted Cruz, Run! Hillary Clinton and the Democrats Need You","H. A. Goodman, ContributorColumnist published in The Cleveland Plain Dealer, The Baltimo...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/run-ted-cruz-run-hillary_b_5468010.html,Why does GOP enthusiasm for the tea party senator translate into another Clinton in the Oval Office?,2014-06-08,"Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, pauses while speaking during the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in National Harbor, Maryland, U.S., on Thursday, March 6, 2014. CPAC, a project of the American Conservative Union (ACU), runs until Saturday, March 8. Photographer: Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cc562500008e013a5120.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party, and liberals everywhere won a giant victory on the road to the 2016 election. According to Politico, ""Sen. Ted Cruz dominated the presidential straw poll at the Texas GOP convention on Saturday, pulling in 43.4 percent of the votes at the contest in his home state, far ahead of other possible 2016 contenders on the ballot."" Cruz was ""mobbed"" by supporters at his exhibition booth and his speeches at the convention elicited cheers of ""Run, Ted, run!"" Since Hillary Clinton's approval rating recently hit a six-year low according to Fox News, Democrats needed some good news. With endless Republican political attacks focusing on everything from Benghazi to the release of Sgt. Bergdahl, conservatives have done a good job shaping their narrative of recent events. The ascent of Sen. Cruz, however, might eventually erase all the hard work of Fox News and the mainstream Republican establishment. Why does GOP enthusiasm for the tea party senator translate into another Clinton in the Oval Office? Even though the former secretary of state's rating sits at a six-year low (49 percent), Politico reported in April that Ted Cruz has one of the lowest favorability numbers of all the possible GOP nominees. It stated, ""Ted Cruz is viewed favorably by 23 percent and unfavorably by 31 percent."" These numbers aren't the work of the nefarious liberal media. Ted Cruz's 23 percent favorability rating is stated in a Fox News poll. As for the issues, the Texas senator has viewpoints contrary to the mainstream, and luckily for Democrats, has no qualms whatsoever articulating these views. While the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication states that 97 percent of climate scientists say ""global warming is happing and mostly human caused,"" the Tea Party star has a different scientific analysis. According to CNN, Sen. Cruz had the following observations missed by almost all climate scientists:""I am always troubled by a theory that fits every perfect situation...It is ironic that he sees a greater threat from your SUV in your driveway than he does from the nation of Iran, with their radical Islamic jihad and - and their stated desire to obliterate, to annihilate Israel. He sees a greater threat from your SUV than he does to Iranian nuclear weapons,"" Cruz said of Kerry. Masterfully fitting in radical Islam alongside climate change, Cruz has unique views on a wide range of other topics as well.Regarding foreign policy, he ignores President Bush's reaction to the Russian invasion of Georgia in 2008 (which was essentially the same rhetoric expressed by President Obama) and correlated a lack of strength as the primary reason Putin invaded Ukraine. According to an ABC News article in March, Cruz blamed Obama for the Ukrainian invasion:""A critical reason for Putin's aggression has been President Obama's weakness...You'd better believe Putin sees in Benghazi four Americans are murdered, the first ambassador killed in service since 1979, and nothing happens,"" Cruz added, echoing comments by other Republicans like Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. ""You'd better believe that Putin sees that in Syria, Obama draws a red line and ignores the red line. You'd better believe that Putin sees all over the world.""Apparently if we had sent ground troops to Syria or prevented the Bengahzi attacks, Putin wouldn't have invaded the Ukraine.As for gay marriage, Cruz introduced an anti-gay marriage bill earlier in the year. His thoughts on marriage equality have the tone of a person out of touch with the Pew Research finding that ""68% of Millennials favor allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally."" His words on the subject can be found in a 2013 The Blaze article: ""If you look at other nations that have gone down the road towards gay marriage, that's the next step of where it gets enforced,"" he said of hate speech regulations that are in place in other countries.Thus far, 16 countries allow same-sex marriage, so perhaps Cruz is referring to one of these nations as going ""down the road"" toward hate speech regulations. How Cruz correlates gay marriage as a risk to First Amendment rights is a bit of a mystery. As for the religious aspect of gay marriage, the Holy Land of Israel recognizes same-sex marriages performed outside the country. Regarding the economy, the nation's woes are a direct consequence of Obamacare. In a USA Today op-ed, Cruz explains the following consequences resulted from the ACA:Moreover, Obamacare is a major jobs killer, especially for those struggling to climb the economic ladder. Workers are seeing their hours cut, and small businesses are unable to hire new employees.Furthermore, Cruz has stated that, ""According to a recent Congressional Budget Office report, under Obamacare, 7 million people will lose their employer-sponsored insurance."" This statement is categorizes as ""Mostly false,"" according to Politifact.org. In fact, according to research by Politifact.org, a whopping 3 percent of Ted Cruz's statements are ranked ""True."" Shockingly, 69 percent of the recent statements articulated by Cruz are either ""Mostly False,"" ""False,"" or ""Pants on Fire."" One can guess what the words before ""Pants on Fire"" entail. Finally, the rise of Ted Cruz should make liberals everywhere very happy. His penchant for being outspoken on issues might bode well regionally and within the GOP, but for a national election it will work to put Hillary Clinton in the White House. If by a snowball's chance-in a region not known for air conditioning-that Cruz wins the presidency, at least liberals can finally have their own chance at a birth certificate controversy. "

Income equality is not like the weather. Rather than just complaining about it, we can actually do something to make it better.",2014-06-08,"French economist Thomas Piketty smiles during a meeting at the National Assembly on March 13, 2013 in Paris. AFP PHOTO / FRED DUFOUR (Photo credit should read FRED DUFOUR/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cc5d2100004202c961b6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"All of a sudden... talk about economic inequality is everywhere.Or at least it feels that way. The New York Times launched its ongoing ""Great Divide"" feature not too long ago; a spate of new books, reports, studies and opinion pieces have taken up various aspects of the problem; and then there is French economist Thomas Piketty's book. Capital in the 21st Century, which has landed like a bombshell and turned Piketty himself into a rock star on the American stage.Some of these examinations were probably inevitable given that we are marking the 50th anniversary of Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty. It turns out that economic inequality shrank during that war, but the arrows reversed starting in the late 1970s. Then beginning in the 1980s we stopped caring about poverty and inequality altogether. When Ronald Reagan declared famously that we fought a war on poverty and ""poverty won,"" he was wrong on the policy analysis. But that wasn't really the point. Reagan was really signaling how much contempt he -- and the entire ""supply-side"" ""trickle-down"" ""free-market fundamentalism"" economic crowd -- had for the poor and for those who found themselves economically stagnant despite how hard and how long they worked.Piketty's book has a predecessor of sorts in Michael Harrington's 1962 blockbuster, The Other America. ""There is a familiar America,"" Harrington wrote. ""It is celebrated in speeches and advertised on television and in the magazines. It has the highest mass standard of living the world has ever known."" But there was, he went on, another America, an impoverished nation ""maimed in body and spirit"" of between 40 and 50 million people. That was the other America, and Harrington brought the nation's attention to it. The book has sold over a million copies.John Kennedy read the book, and after his assassination, it inspired Johnson not only to declare a war on poverty but provided the ideas for several of the specific programs he initiated, including Medicare, Medicaid and food stamps.That story oversimplifies the history, to be sure. The Other America had the resonance it did in 1962 because the nation already had a heightened awareness of related kinds of inequality. The civil rights movement was at its high-water mark and Betty Friedan would help launch a revived feminist movement the next year with the publication of The Feminine Mystique. The war on poverty, in other words, was launched in a political context in which many Americans cared already about social justice. And that's where my analogy between Piketty's book and Harrington's becomes vexing.It's worth remembering that the short-hand we use now to describe economic inequality -- the 1 percent vs. the 99 percent -- has been bequeathed to us from the short-lived ""Occupy"" phenomenon. Occupy deserves credit for putting economic inequality back into our national conversation for the first time in a generation.But Occupy never developed into a ""movement,"" not in any meaningful sense. It wound up as a set of gestures and theatricals -- at worst, it amounted to little more than a slow-moving flash-mob. Nor did it ever really want to become anything else, to judge by those quoted in the press and by my own experiences at several different Occupy encampments.Hostile to ""agendas,"" ""demands,"" ""leadership,"" and even basic principles of organizing, Occupy appealed to the alienated, disgruntled, and the variously angry with the therapeutic promise of a ""politics of authenticity."" It did not spend much time trying to channel frustrations into a roadmap for political action. For an easy contrast, look at the tea party. Both groups share some of the same complaints about American politics. Tea partiers have attempted, and with some success, to hijack the political system for their own goals. Occupiers walked away from it.And perhaps that was inevitable. It is a cliché to say that movements are built on a foundation of ideas, but in that sense our newly awakened concern about inequality came in the wrong order. Occupy arrived on the scene before the great wealth of ideas now circulating about economic justice did. Occupy brought together all the passion and energy of a movement without much of the intellectual glue necessary to hold movements together. As a result, it evaporated almost as quickly as it appeared.Three years after Occupy came and went we now have that intellectual glue in great abundance. We know about economic inequality in more detail and depth than we ever have before, and we know unequivocally that the economic policies of the last generation -- policies which remain at the center of the Republican agenda -- have made inequality worse. Figuring out whether all this intellectual work can galvanize a political movement, of course, is the task ahead of us.While we observe the 50th anniversary of the war on poverty, it is also worth remembering that Michael Harrington was also looking back when he titled his book The Other America. His title echoed the 1890 book How the Other Half Lives, written by Jacob Riis. That book, a searing expose of the living conditions of immigrants in some of Manhattan's worst neighborhoods, became a foundation of the Progressive Movement.Riis' book mattered to the Progressive generation just as Harrington's book mattered to the generation that started to build the Great Society. Right now Thomas Piketty's book, and all the others that have exposed, analyzed and offered prescriptions for our economic inequality, are powerful ideas in search of a movement. Income equality is not like the weather. Rather than just complaining about it, we can actually do something to make it better.Steven Conn teaches history at Ohio State University.

""The clear principle is we don't leave soldiers behind. And at the moment, I think what's necessary here, I'm reminded this Sunday morning of the story of the prodigal son. That you don't make judgments as you have the opportunity to bring that child back."" ""America should be loving this child at this moment,"" Williams continued, growing visibly emotional. ""Obviously we don't know why he left. We think he's a troubled person. We think he may have lost a sense of America's mission. All true. But the idea is we don't leave people in the enemy's hands. The enemy saw him as an American soldier. That young man suffered. He was caged, Chris. His parents suffered. And yet people want to argue about the father's beard. They want to say they shouldn't have a parade. Let the military decide. The military's in the best position, not us sitting here on this panel, and not all the political people on the Republican side who have flip-flopped -- flip-flopped, Chris, in the most craven way. Unbelievable.""Bergdahl's case has long been emotionally charged within the U.S. military, with many believing he deserted his post. Several soldiers from his unit recently also spoke out against him on television. Bergdahl's family has been receiving death threats during a week of intense media criticism, which has focused not only on Bergdahl, but also on his father. Many of the most aggressive statements have been broadcast on Fox, although MSNBC and CNN have also featured similar material. The FBI is  investigating the death threats against Bergdahl's family. After previously advocating for Bergdahl's release, some Republican senators have aggressively attacked the exchange of five Taliban members for his return. Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) had urged the administration to ""do all it can"" to ensure Bergdahl's safe return, only to say that a prisoner swap would embolden terrorists. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) has been taken to task for prior comments that he would support a prisoner exchange deal to ensure Bergdahl's return home, only to attack the Obama deal after it was orchestrated."

Farnsworth, the political scientist, said he was unaware of any polling data on potential voters ahead on Tuesday's match-up.On the money front, Cantor has a commanding edge.In the fundraising period from April 1 to May 21, the incumbent raised $449,000 in the pre-primary period, and reported $1.5 million in cash on hand. Meanwhile, Brat raised $117,000, and reported nearly $84,000 in the bank.Tea Party activists may have a better chance for an upset in the Mississippi Senate race between incumbent Thad Cochran and challenger Chris McDaniel, which heads to a runoff vote on June 24.Even if Brat loses, the Tea Party may feel a lift from having challenged a powerful incumbent, Farnsworth said: ""Even if Cantor wins, he'll be looking over his shoulder for what might happen two years from now.""

And while the average attractions cast member at Disney’s parks and resorts earned just $16.39 per hour, Disney also employs far higher-paid workers at its ABC and ESPN television networks.Recently, a number of these companies have chosen to use their resources for massive deal making. In February, Comcast announced a deal to acquire Time Warner Cable for $45.2 billion in stock value. In May, AT&T agreed to acquire DirecTV for $48.5 billion. Regulators have yet to approve the deals. Last year, Verizon signed on to an even bigger deal when it bought out British telecom Vodafone’s 45% stake in Verizon Wireless for $130 billion.Of course, companies may not necessarily have an obligation to pay their employees a higher wage. If the recent spate of mega deals is any indication, companies can spend huge amounts to help provide better returns to their shareholders.However, many argue that companies still spend too much in executive compensation. Comcast chairman and CEO Brian Roberts earned more than $31 million last year in salary, stock options and awards, and other benefits. Bob Iger, CEO of Disney, received more than $100 million in total compensation from 2011 through 2013. Outsized salaries like these appear especially disproportionate when compared to low-wage workers.Based on data provided by Capital IQ on S&P 500 companies, 24/7 Wall St. identified corporations with high operating income, high operating profit margins, and major one-year growth in operating income. In order to be considered, companies had to be in a customer-facing industry and have a large number of low-wage workers. We excluded financial companies, such as banks and thrifts, because the data we used to measure profitability is inadequate for judging the industry’s performance. Employee totals by company are from Yahoo! Finance. CEO pay is from filings submitted by public companies with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Figures on compensation are from Glassdoor.com and are self-reported by users to the website.Here are eight companies that owe workers a raise, according to 24/7 Wall St.: "

""Lorde is not Kurt Cobain's peer.
