What to do when what you want to teach your kids about the world is at odds with the message the educator sends? That's the dilemma facing Eva Wisnik, a mother of three in suburban New York, and she and her son have asked me to ask Parentry readers for advice. She writes: Today in school, Jake, age 11, was asked to write down on an index card what he wanted to be when he grew up. He wrote down ""happy"". The teacher told him in front of the class that he missed the point of the assignment. What do you think of this response? The dilemma raises both practical questions and existential ones. Of course the teacher was expecting an answer like ""doctor"" or ""firefighter,"" and I have always cringed a bit when adults have asked my children their life's career plans. It has always felt like a way to cram big spirits into small holes. Add to that bias, this one: in seventh grade my social studies teacher insisted that a landmark I had stood upon just months earlier simply didn't exist. I remember the feeling of helplessness -- my truth against her power. And yet, in an age when parents swoop in far too often, resulting, we are told, in a generation that is coddled and entitled, is this the kind of fight you want to pick? Especially when life will be full of moments where there is an expected way to answer. Maybe it is better for them to start learning how to meet those expectations now? Yes, I think it was the teacher who ""missed the point of the assignment,"" not Jake. But what should his mother do about that?ALSO ON THE HUFFINGTON POST"

We answer as many as we can, either by email to questions@airfarewatchdog.com or in our Q&A column. You can also post your question in the comments below.Booking Direct Vs. Online Travel Agency?Q: I read recently that you can save money by booking online directly with the airlines rather than on a site like Expedia, even though the contracts between the airlines and the online travel agencies prohibit the airlines from offering lower rates. Allegedly the airlines circumvent this restriction by offering discount codes in emails to their frequent fliers or through Facebook and Twitter or through email. I don't mind going directly online to the airline's web site but is there a way for the rest of us who are not frequent fliers to find discount codes?A: You're correct that airlines are using promo codes to entice passengers to book directly on their sites. We see frequent 10%- to even 50%-off promotions. Airlines hate paying fees to computerized reservation systems or to travel agents, whether online or ""bricks and mortar."" In fact, it's one of their largest expenses, after fuel, airplane purchases and labor costs. The beauty of using an online travel agency is that you can easily compare prices, and you'll learn if it's cheaper to fly out on one airline and back on another, something that an airline website won't tell you. Price aside, you can also find a range of convenient flight times among several carriers at a glance. To learn about promo codes, sign up for your favorite airlines' emails. The Airfarewatchdog Blog also lists all airline promo codes.Code Shared FlightsQ: When booking international flights online, I increasingly find that the airline selling the fare isn't the airline actually flying the route. For example, I'll search for a flight on Orbitz.com and see that the lowest fare is sold by Lufthansa but the flight is flown by United. Sometimes we don't even learn this until we get our confirmation, or the flight is sold by Delta but we'll be flying on Alitalia. How can we avoid this situation and why do airlines do this in the first place?A: This is called code sharing, and it's a way for airlines to share capacity, appear to have larger route networks than they actually do and increase profits. It can be quite annoying if you have a strong preference for one airline over another. Often, when looking online at Orbitz or other fare comparison websites, you'll see that two different airlines fly the exact same route at the exact same times but at very different prices. That's your first clue that this is a code share flight. If you're unsure what you're buying, it's best to call the online travel agency in such cases to ask exactly which airline's ""metal"" you'll be flying on. To its credit, code sharing can often be a way to save significantly if one airline is selling the flight for considerably less than its code share partner."

In a scoop rivaling the exposure of Romney's disdain for 47 percent of Americans, Mother Goose magazine is about to release a grainy video which may or may not be from a Romney debate prep session. The source who shot the video insisted on anonymity, fearing charges of hypocrisy because even though he doesn't pay any income tax, he still sometimes uses public roads to get from one place to another. A few snippets:Q. Governor Romney, you've said that anyone who takes less than the legally allowable tax deductions isn't qualified to be president. Yet you did just that on your 2011 return. What's the deal?A. F**k you for asking. I have three years to file an amended return and take the full deduction. I pledge here and now that I will do so, win or lose, the day after the election. Q. Polls indicate that you've lost ground with voters since you dismissed 47 percent of them as government-dependent bums. Would you like to apologize to the American people here and now?A. As I explained in my book No Apologies, I will never apologize for anything. (Mitt turns to Obama stand-in Rob Portman.) Mr. President, when will you apologize for apologizing for America throughout your extraordinarily disgraceful 'Apologize for America' tour? (Everyone in the room applauds this ""game-changing"" moment.) Q. Governor, you wrote, ""We can accomplish [the individual mandate you imposed in Massachusetts] for everyone in the country."" But then you said you would repeal Obamacare, which depends on just such a mandate. What gives?A. Obviously, Jim, I quoted myself out of context. I'm a man who has compassion; therefore I'm proud that I've provided all the kids and grandkids in one of my home states with government-guaranteed health insurance. And I will repeal Obamacare before lunch on my first day.Q. But sir, under the Constitution the president doesn't have the power to repeal any law. A. What part of ""Constitutional Amendment"" don't you understand? I'll sign one of those before breakfast.Q. Do you think the government should have paid welfare benefits to your father for a full year even though he didn't work? Isn't that wealth redistribution?A. To quote my good friend Herman Cain, ""apples and oranges."" When my dad was on welfare, people didn't have to work. Now they do. (Again, he turns to Obama.) Or I should say they did until you, Mr. President, gutted the work requirement. Q. But the president didn't gut the work requirement.A. He did too! And I have the campaign ads to prove it.Q. After taking the full spectrum of positions on abortion, you promised ""absolutely"" that you would sign the so-called personhood amendment, which states that ""life begins at conception"" and would criminalize all abortions, including in cases of rape or incest. Would you jail women who've been raped?A. Fertilized eggs are people, my friend. My position on abortion continues to evolve, so by definition there can't be any of what you people call ""contradictions."" (Air quotes) Q. Peggy Noonan has suggested you might save the ""rolling calamity"" that is your campaign by bringing in James Baker, the man chiefly responsible for stealing the 2000 election for W.A. Clearly, election theft is the nuclear option. We'll try to win without it, but we'd be crazy to take it off the table.Q. Finally, Governor, the American people want to know more about you. You've expressed your affection for cars, trees, clouds, grass and America. What else do you love? A. Well, of course, as you know, there's nothing like a great big block of American cheese followed by a heaping hunk of Boston cream pie. But I love foods from every corner of this great country of ours. I love California oranges (unless, of course, there's a Florida orange available, in which case, a must-win-state fruit takes precedence), Philadelphia cheese steaks, Iowa corn and items from all the other swing states.

""I love you,"" the 16-year-old said as she left the car. Paula Wheeler never saw her daughter again.She still recalls in chilling detail the scene 16 years later, when the man convicted of killing her daughter and three others turned to her and her husband in court and highlighted the painful fact that their child's body had never been found.""My parents will know where I'm at when I'm gone, but you'll never know where Chevy is,"" she remembers Wesley Shermantine telling them. The condemned killer long refused to offer information about his victims' fate or whereabouts.But after more than a decade of silence on death row, Shermantine, 46, has begun to speak out about the string of murders - by his count, six dozen - he committed with his childhood friend and partner in crime, Loren Herzog.Together they were dubbed the ""Speed Freak"" killers, so named for the methamphetamine-fueled violence investigators said they unleashed in and around California's farm-rich San Joaquin Valley during the 1980s and 1990s.Authorities have long suspected the pair in as many as 22 deaths in all, mostly of young women and girls who went missing.If Shermantine's claims prove true, he and Herzog, who committed suicide in January, could end up responsible for 72 killings, ranking them among the most prolific serial murderers in U.S. history.Shermantine began dribbling out information late last year to a bounty hunter who offered him money in exchange for the location of burial sites.The killer's crudely drawn maps helped lead authorities in February to skeletal remains of Chevy Wheeler and four others, finally providing a measure of closure to Paula Wheeler and some of the other victims' relatives.But those discoveries may represent just a fraction of a much larger tally.In a recent letter to a reporter, Shermantine put the number of victims at ""24 X 3,"" though he has suggested Herzog was mainly responsible. And a telephone hot line investigators set up this year drew reports of about 65 missing persons who callers believed may have fallen prey to Shermantine and Herzog.Prosecutor Thomas Testa, who tried both men, said such high numbers strike him as possibly intended for ""shock value.""""We never had a number anywhere near 70,"" he said. But, he added, ""I wouldn't discount it entirely ... Maybe there's some fame in a higher number than the next guy.""Meanwhile, efforts to locate and positively identify remains have been painstakingly slow.A California state legislator and a retired FBI agent assigned to interview Shermantine and assess his credibility say the renewed investigation was badly hindered by ineptitude and by law enforcement agencies working at cross purposes. A KILLER'S MAPS AND GUIDED TOURIn a rare step authorized by the state Legislature in hopes of a breakthrough, Shermantine was briefly released under guard from San Quentin State Prison late last month to personally direct FBI agents to sites where he claimed to have disposed of more of his victims.Law enforcement officials have remained tight-lipped about what, if anything, they discovered during his one-day outing in August, months after excavations of Shermantine's map sites first bo r e fruit.In a shallow grave near the former site of Shermantine's family home in San Andreas, 100 miles (160 km) northeast of San Francisco, cadaver dogs discovered Wheeler's remains and her lavender-colored sweatshirt in February. The remains of Cyndi Vanderheiden, who was 25 when she disappeared in 1998, were unearthed from a ravine a short distance away.Although prosecutors could not produce either body when they brought Shermantine to trial, a jury convicted him in 2001 of murdering both Vanderheiden and Wheeler, along with two men shot on a pitch-black highway in 1984.Also in February, investigators recovered three more sets of remains tied to Shermantine from an abandoned well near a former cattle ranch in the San Joaquin County town of Linden. A forensic anthropologist determined the bones belonged to Kimberly Billy, 19, JoAnn Hobson, 16, and an unidentified teenage girl.Skeletal remains of a fetus were found there as well, along with shoes, coats, a woman's ring, a purse and nearly 1,000 bone fragments.Neither Shermantine nor Herzog was charged in the murder of Billy, a newlywed who went missing in 1984, or Hobson, a friend of Wheeler who attended the same high school and vanished in 1985, weeks before her classmate. But in another courtroom outburst at the time of his own sentencing, Shermantine told Hobson's mother that Herzog had gone out on a date with her daughter the night she died.A separate jury found Herzog guilty of three murders, including Vanderheiden's, but his conviction was reduced on appeal to a single count of manslaughter, and he was paroled after 11 years in prison.Whatever Herzog knew about his victims' whereabouts, he took to his own grave in January, hanging himself just hours after the bounty hunter involved in the investigation informed him that Shermantine was starting to pinpoint grave sites. 'WE'RE TIRED OF WAITING'Shermantine began mapping locations of remains he claimed were discarded in abandoned wells and mine shafts and buried on remote hillsides and beneath a trailer park after meeting late last year with retired FBI agent Jeffrey Rinek.By then, a Sacramento-based bounty hunter, Leonard Padilla, had agreed to pay Shermantine up to $33,000 for information leading to remains of his victims.But Rinek and Assemblywoman Cathleen Galgiani, a Stockton Democrat, have sharply criticized San Joaquin County Sheriff Steve Moore as impeding the effort. They accused Moore of trying to block Shermantine's visit to burial sites, then destroying evidence by allowing his deputies to recklessly dig for graves with a backhoe.""They give more respect to dinosaurs than they do to these victims,"" said Rinek, who joined the investigation at the request of the FBI.Galgiani recently formed a special task force to bring together dozens of law enforcement agencies that believe Shermantine might help them crack cold cases.""The families of victims have waited and waited, and they wonder why nothing's happening. I know the torture it puts families through,"" Galgiani said.The FBI has since taken the lead in the search for bodies, but a bureau spokesman declined to comment on the case.Moore likewise declined to discuss specifics of the probe, though he confirmed that Shermantine visited San Joaquin County under heavy guard on Aug. 26.""We are now working with the FBI to further the investigation based on that activity. We stand ready to assist the FBI in making recoveries, which has been our goal all along,"" he said. ""We will do everything we can to bring these victims home.""Sue Kizer is waiting. Her 18-year-old daughter, Gayle Marks, disappeared from Stockton in 1988. Authorities consider Shermantine and Herzog possible suspects.""I want to get her out of wherever she is, thrown at the bottom of a dusty well or laying in the mud somewhere. I can't bear the thought,"" Kizer said. ""Every family I'm in contact with, they all want the same thing. We want them to get out there and dig up the bodies. And we're tired of waiting.""

A recent bill introduced by Senator Alex Padilla, passed by the California legislature and signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown, exemplifies this kind of policy leadership, and will be a model for how a common sense, bipartisan approach to public policy can bring the benefits of broadband innovation to Californians for years to come. As consumers increasingly show a preference for mobile voice and broadband services, American innovators -- many based in California -- are bringing an astounding array of new products and services to market that both anticipate and respond to evolving consumer demand. FCC data indicates that more than 30 percent of adults are now living in wireless-only households and according to Nielsen, nearly 55 percent of U.S. mobile subscribers own smartphones. Whether you live in a rural area or an urban center, broadband connectivity is providing opportunities not even dreamed of just a few years ago. From improved health monitoring, to eLearning opportunities, better access to municipal services and public safety, and increased economic empowerment, and civic engagement, the mobile communications revolution is a driving force in our nation's economic and social fabric.Wireless broadband access is also helping close the digital divide across the nation. For instance, the Pew Internet and American Life Project estimates that Hispanics and African Americans are adopting smartphones at a faster pace than the national average and any other demographic group. And Internet usage among Americans over 65 has more than tripled in the past 10 years. A recent FCC order on Lifeline services highlighted the increasing importance of wireless connections to those living in or near poverty.As the mobile revolution continues to impact Americans everywhere, U.S. wireless companies are responding to the exploding increase in demand. This includes investing hundreds of billions of dollars -- more than any other American business -- to transition expensive and outdated infrastructure, to a new, Internet-based platform. These ""smart"" networks will give consumers more choices in how they connect, and have an even greater impact for U.S. businesses, many of whom depend on the Internet to communicate.The success of these next-generation ""smart"" technologies depends on an equally wise regulatory structure that encourages such a transition. By supporting a modernized communications infrastructure that will meet consumer needs and support our digital economy, government policies can help fuel growth and enhance our mobile competitiveness worldwide. That is why we look to California's IP bill as an important blueprint for securing broadband's great promise for the citizens and economy of our nation's largest state. The paradigm set out in the law eliminates the regulatory uncertainty that can stifle private investment in innovative new Internet technologies throughout California. And, it reinforces the goal of widespread, affordable broadband that can be used in countless ways across the Golden State's economy and communities.Our nation is a global leader in wireless, Internet and IP-enabled services and sound policies such as California's new law will help ensure the mobile future is bright for consumers everywhere.Jonathan Spalter, chairman of Mobile Future, has been founding CEO of leading technology, media, and research companies, including Public Insight, Snocap, and Atmedica Worldwide.

White's sold-out Saturday night concert at Radio City got off to a ""rollicking"" start, but 45 minutes into the show he abruptly left the stage, according to The New York Observer's Hunter Walker. Concertgoers initially thought an encore was coming and continued to cheer and clap. Twenty minutes later, the lights went on and ushers told the crowd to go. Once outside Radio City, a group of more than 100 people gathered by the backstage exit, according to The Observer. The mini-mob booed and hissed, demanding to know why White's concert ended so suddenly. They became more irate when a pizza deliveryman showed up to bring multiple pies backstage. Rumors as to why White left percolated the crowd. Some thought he was annoyed at the half-hearted crowd (""Jesus Christ, is this an NPR convention?"" White reportedly asked at one point during the show). Buzzfeed speculated that it may have had something to do with a vast amount of tickets going to scalpers. White was reportedly unhappy with Radio City's sound system, according to Yahoo! Music. The 37-year-old reportedly had issues with the sound when he played at Boston's Agganis Arena. ""Jack White is a control freak,"" wrote the Boston Herald's Jed Gottlieb. ""Yes, he’s obsessed with a sound, image and branding devoted to making him look like a mad genius. As he should be, that’s what’s rock ‘n’ roll is about.""Many disgruntled attendees, who paid at least $40 for a ticket, took to Twitter to voice their indignation. Excitement turns into disbelief as one of my most influential music heroes plays 45 mediocreminutes and leaves. I'm done with Jack White.Prior to the concert, White discussed his impulsive nature in an interview with the New York Post: ""I’ve got friends who are very indecisive and they hem and haw for weeks. I think it would be better to make your decision within a couple of seconds. Even if you make the wrong decision, at least you didn’t sap all your energy by worrying and over thinking things.”White is scheduled to play Radio City again on Sunday night.

Among animated films that aren't sequels/spin-offs and weren't release by either Dreamworks or Disney/Pixar, this opening actually ranks rather high. If you count the two Dr. Seuss adaptations (The Lorax with $70 million and Horton Hears a Who with $45 million), Hotel Transylvania is the fifth-biggest non-sequel/spin-off animated opening not released by the two animation titans. If you only count wholly original properties, then it trails only Despicable Me ($56 million) and the first Ice Age ($46 million) and comes in just ahead of Warner Bros' Happy Feet ($41 million). If you count it as an Adam Sandler vehicle (and it was arguably sold as one), then this is Sandler's second-largest debut, behind The Longest Yard ($47 million) and just ahead of the $42.2 million opening of Anger Management. Among those older than 12, the picture played 60 percent female and 30 percent under 25. Seventy-six percent came from families and among the under 12 set it played 52 percent female and 75 percent under 10 years old. The film cost Sony between $85 and $100 million, still almost a bargain as far as mainstream animation goes. It opened higher than every 2011 animated film save for Cars 2 and Kung Fu Panda 2 and but 2012 has done a better job of spreading out their animated fare (we of course remember the great glut of Spring 2011). The last time Sony hit the animation jackpot was around this time 2009, when Cloudy With the Chance of Meatballs opened with $30 million and went on to earn $124 million domestic and $243 million worldwide. Not even counting the larger presence of 3D auditoriums worldwide three years later, a similar path would give the new film $177 million domestic and $349 million worldwide. Point being, this is a big win for all involved, even if Frankenweenie steals its thunder next weekend. Also coming from Sony (courtesy of TriStar) was Looper (review), which earned $21.2 million. The well-reviewed picture had a strong 3.0x weekend multiplier. The Bruce Willis/Joseph Gordon-Levitt/Emily Blunt time travel thriller played 59 percent male and 70 percent over-25. The number is right in Bruce Willis's normal wheelhouse while it's easily the biggest debut for Gordon Levitt that doesn't involve Chris Nolan and/or a blink-and-you miss it appearance as a mostly masked Cobra Commander. The $60 million picture was a rare example of geek/online interest actually translating to general audiences, as geek-friendly bombs like Dredd (-64 percent this weekend for a $2.8 million weekend and $10 million cume) and Scott Pilgrim vs. the World are more common. It earned a general B from Cinemascore and a B+ from males. The big question now is whether or not the film will have legs. Normally I'd say yes, with a multiplier of at least 3x the weekend, but there is a lot of adult genre fare over the next couple months, starting next weekend with Taken 2 and following up with Argo, Seven Psychopaths, Cloud Atlas, and Alex Cross further down the month. Still, this is a good weekend for Sony, even as Resident Evil: Retribution continues to fall fast here, taking in $3 million and ending weekend three with $38 million. Fortunately it's going gangbusters overseas, which was kind of the point. The surprise success story of the weekend was Universal's platform release for the Anna Kendrick/Rebel Wilson comedy Pitch Perfect. Sold as 'Bring It On meets Glee', Universal opened this surprisingly well-reviewed picture (I passed on numerous press screenings because I listed to the one fellow critic who didn't like it... whoops) on 335 screens, a real risk in this frontloaded era. But a deluge of preview screenings and strong buzz powered this one to a stunning $5.2 million gross and a $15,000 per-screen average. The $17 million film played 76 percent female and earned an A+ from women under 25. The picture goes wide next weekend and expect it to succeed in ways that sadly Whip It could not. Frankly, I can't recall a film making that much on that few screens since Paranormal Activity earned $7 million on 200 screens just over three years ago. Come what may, the film's performance is yet another promising sign, along with the blockbuster success of Mission: Impossible: Ghost Protocol, towards the eventual end of the 'opening weekend is everything' mentality. Fairing less well in wide release was Won't Back Down. Sold as an inspirational 'let's fix our public schools' melodrama, word got out that it was actually right-wing propaganda that blamed teachers unions for everything and tried to sell charter schools as the answer. I'm not sure whether a Viola Davis/Maggie Gyllenhaal social issues drama would have been a blockbuster without the controversy, but it probably didn't help. Anyway, the film earned $2.7 million so it's pretty much finished before it can begin. For holdover box office news, read the rest at Mendelson's Memos."

(AP Photo/Denis Poroy)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6b4952400005000985ccc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Dan Pompei, National Football Post  Change has been invigorating for the Atlanta Falcons. It’s not wholesale change or even considerable change. It’s mostly subtle change, which was probably the perfect prescription for a team that won ten games but bowed out in the wildcard round of the playoffs last season.The Falcons could have just sat back and counted on internal improvement. Instead, they decided to attack. They attacked by hiring offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter and defensive coordinator Mike Nolan, and then they have attacked by dictating to opponents on both sides of the ball.The new mentality has brought out the best in maturing players such as Matt Ryan, Julio Jones, Jacquizz Rodgers, Sam Baker, Thomas DeCoud, William Moore and Sean Weatherspoon.This was all part of head coach Mike Smith’s plan. He hired two coordinators who were willing to work with the foundation the team had already put in place, as well as with the assistant coaches on staff. Smith knew what he was getting into with Koetter and Nolan because he had worked with both previously.Koetter even has given Ryan a hand in designing the offense. The main difference in the Falcons’ offense is their gameplans are based more on identifying and exploiting opponents’ weaknesses. “Dirk has put together a really aggressive game plan,” Smith told me. “He wants to be attacking. That’s what he did as a college head coach. Now what we’re doing is more predicated on how people are trying to defend us.”People are not defending the Falcons very well. They have scored touchdowns on each of their three opening drives and are averaging 31.3 points per game—third highest in the NFL.Of course none of that would be possible if Ryan wasn’t being protected so well. Protection was an issue a year ago, but he has been sacked only four times this year. Smith attributes this to better play from the returning offensive linemen and to Ryan improving both his pocket awareness and his strength so he is able to step into throws better.Ryan has taken care of the football exceptionally well, throwing only one interception. He is a big reason why the Falcons are plus-10 in the takeaway department.Another big reason is Nolan’s scheming. Nolan has coached 3-4 fronts for seven years, and he has coached 4-3 fronts for seven years. He has combined both principles in his most recent defenses. The Falcons often have four down linemen in base, but become very unpredictable in nickel, coming at quarterbacks from all angles.“When I hired Mike, I knew Mike wants to get opponents in third down,” Smith said. “Mike always has one of the best third down teams in the league, year in, year out. He is very creative, especially on third down. And that’s the money down.”The other thing Nolan has done is let players play. “He’s done a very good job of identifying what are players are capable of doing and putting them in position to do what they do best,” Smith said. “He’s been a new set of eyes for us. That’s refreshing. You can become where you don’t see the trees because of the forest.”Weatherspoon is a perfect example of a player who seems to be moving faster this year, playing to his full athleticism. “We’ve been very encouraged with how Mike has worked with the defense, Smitty and the other coaches to create a defense that is appropriate for the talent we have,” Falcons general manager Thomas Dimitroff said. “He has taken fast, athletic players and created a defense that plays with confidence and an edge.”The season is young and things are likely to keeping changing. But so far, the change has been all good in Atlanta.Things I Didn’t Used To Know*The Jaguars anticipated Maurice Jones-Drew would take a couple games to get rolling, and weren’t surprised when he broke out in the third game of the season. Initially after Jones-Drew’s holdout, it was clear he needed reps from a mental standpoint. He needed to get in sync with blockers and get completely familiar with new schemes against various defensive fronts. Jones-Drew was more tentative than usual in the early going. But his coaches noted rapid improvement prior to last week, as his technique and footwork became more second nature to him. It has helped that Jones-Drew is being helped along by esteemed running backs coach Sylvester Crooms.*The Cowboys did not sign Brandon Carr to play safety on a regular basis, but now that they have him their eyes have been opened to the possibility, and they like what they see. The plan is to use Carr to his strengths at the position. That means he won’t be banging helmets with guards very often, even though he is willing to hit. Instead, Carr will be used basically like a glorified cornerback, covering receivers and tight ends. With the way the game has evolved, defenses can get away with having safeties like Carr, especially on nickel downs. As a cover safety, Carr might even be better than as a cornerback, because as a corner he has to play with his back to the ball more—and that is not his strength.My Sunday Best: Controversial CallsWe will be talking about the Golden Tate--M.D. Jennings Hail Mary play for many, many years. Given the unusual circumstances and the scrutiny, it could down in history as the most controversial call in NFL history. Here are my other most controversial calls. Any you’d like to add?*The Immaculate Reception. This was the first step in the Steelers’ dynasty. In this 1972 playoff game, Oakland’s Jack Tatum broke up Terry Bradshaw’s pass to Frenchy Fuqua, sending the ball flying in the air. The Raiders began celebrating, but Franco Harris picked it up just before it hit the ground and ran it to the end zone. The officials weren’t certain if it was a touchdown because the rule at the time said if the ball touched Fuqua, a second Steelers player could not have caught it. After consulting with a league official, referee Fred Swearingen called it a touchdown.*The Tuck Rule Call. Charles Woodson, then of the Raiders sacked New England’s Tom Brady in the snow during this 2002 divisional playoff game. It was ruled he forced a fumble, and the Raiders recovered with 1:43 remaining and a three point lead. But after reviewing the play, referee Walt Coleman, citing the tuck rule, called it an incomplete pass. The Patriots tied the game with a field goal before winning in overtime and eventually becoming Super Bowl champs.*The Jerry Rice Non-Fumble. In a 1998 wild card game between the 49ers and Packers, Rice clearly fumbled late in the game. Officials ruled he was down by contact, however, and the 49ers continued to drive for the game-winning score.*The Ed Hochuli Call. Late in a 2008 game between the Chargers and Broncos, Hochuli ruled Jay Cutler threw an incomplete pass, when he really fumbled. Hochuli knew it and apologized afterwards. The Chargers had recovered the ball and the call probably changed the outcome of the game, which Denver won.*The Renfro No-Catch. In the 1979 AFC championship game between the Steelers and Oilers, Mike Renfro appeared to make a third quarter catch for the Oilers in the end zone that would have tied the score. But officials ruled he failed he get both feet in bounds. The Steelers won and went on to their fourth Super Bowl victory.*The Bert Emanuel Game. Emanuel appeared to make a diving catch in a tight game that would have kept the Bucs alive in the 1999 NFC Championship game in St. Louis. But after a replay review, Bill Carollo said the nose of the ball had hit the ground, and he overturned the decision that it was a catch. The Rams won, but in the offseason the NFL adopted what has become known as The Bert Emanuel rule. Under the new rule, Emanuel’s catch would have counted.*The Super Bowl Mistake. In the 2006 Super Bowl, referee Bill Leavy called Seattle quarterback Matt Hasselbeck for an illegal low block that helped the Steelers win the game. Leavy later acknowledged he was wrong.One Man Yelp: Best of Rivals; Team of the 80s  Best of Rivals was a good book waiting to happen, and author Adam Lazarus did a nice job of putting together a complete, authoritative study of the Joe Montana-Steve Young quarterback controversy/competition. It was a unique dynamic--two future hall of famers competing for the most important job on one of the greatest teams of all time.The tension began as soon as Young arrived in the 49ers locker room after being traded from the Bucs. He didn’t have cleats to wear, so he was given a pair of Montana’s to borrow. Young worked out wearing the shoes with No. 16 written on them. Then he and Montana chatted for awhile. Finally, Montana said, “Steve, when you’re finished, just throw the shoes back in my locker.”Young described the rivalry years later thusly: “People always think that we fought. We never had a cross word, never had an argument, and I’ve always said to people that it went as well as it possibly could with two hypercompetitive people. But it wasn’t easy, it was difficult, difficult for both of us.”Montana’s take: “We’re friends, Steve and I. But out on the practice field, if he doesn’t hate me as much as I hate him, then there’s something wrong.”Lazarus writes that Montana tipped off a Bay Area reporter that Young had covertly erased portions of practice film in which Young threw a bad pass or made the wrong read. And within a week, Young pulled aside the same reporter to refute what he heard Montana had said.In 1991, Montana was hurting before the regular season, and Young was eyeing his starting job. He told reporters, “[George Seifert] said he is not going to have a controversy at all but would look to keep us both sharp. I don’t know how he’s going to do it, but I’m going to be much more involved throughout the season.”Responded Montana: “Wishful thinking.”Lazarus mixes extensive research with interviews of Montana, Young, Jerry Rice, Eddie DeBartolo, Mike Holmgren and others to put together a fine read.*The 49ers might have had the most interesting dynasty of all the dynasties, depending your perspective. At the very least, I think it’s fair to say their dynasty had a greater impact on the NFL than any other dynasty. Bill Walsh’s stamp on the game remains a bold one nearly a quarter of a century after he coached his last game for the 49ers.That’s why I enjoyed watching the DVD San Francisco 49ers: Team of the ‘80s. This is an NFL Films production, so I knew it would be good. There are plenty of clips from Walsh’s personal library of his speeches to the team.The documentary gives you a good feel for Walsh’s mastery. His goal for the 49ers was to be a “precision machine.” It was a concept he borrowed from Paul Brown. But Walsh perfected it.“Our system of football sustained itself and refined itself further and further until at some point it might have even been an art form,” Walsh said.His players bought in completely. “It was easy to believe Bill Walsh because he would tell you things that would happen,” Dwight Clark said. Randy Cross added, “We believe he knew something nobody else knew.”There is no question, it seems, that he did.Hot Reads*Enjoy the applause while it lasts, NFL refs. You will be the subject of scorn and ridicule by next weekend.*Something tells me Lovie Smith, Jim Schwartz and Leslie Frazier would have been very much in favor of T.J. Lang’s idea about having the Packers protest replacement refs.*Strikes me that high def, flat screen televisions sold in the Tampa area should be going at a discounted rate, seeing the residents rarely get to see the home team.*Adam Jones has had to shell out some big money for indiscretions recently, but, hey, what’s a little money to this guy?*Since when did Mike Tyson start playing for the Broncos defense?*Is it just me or is Andrew Hawkins playing at a different speed than everyone else in the NFL?*Let’s just keep one thing in perspective, both for replacement officials and permanent ones: they have an extremely difficult job and they all deserve some respect.Dan Pompei covers pro football for the Chicago Tribune at chicagotribune.com.

(The 1981 team, considered the greatest U.S. Ryder Cup entry ever, had 10 1/2. The dynamic European team of 2004 set the standard, an 11-5 edge into singles.)But if you want to search for some negatives, you can start with Tiger Woods. Now he is used to going to the top of most lists, but he did so in a dubious manner when he and Steve Stricker got thumped by Sergio Garcia and Luke Donald in four-ball.Though Woods played brilliantly down the stretch, making five birdies on the back nine, it was not only his third loss in this week’s action at Medinah Country Club but the 17th of his career. That ties him with Phil Mickelson for the most in American history. (It’s also the fourth time that Woods has lost three times in a Ryder Cup, having done that in 1997, 1999, and 2004.)That down note can be trumped by the positive news surrounding Mickelson. He joined Keegan Bradley to become the first American team to go 3-0 since those titans of 1981, Jack Nicklaus and Tom Watson. Like Mickelson and Bradley, Nicklaus and Watson won two foursomes matches and a four-ball, but they had to go 47 holes; Mickelson and Bradley needed just 44.(Of course, the bar for American teams was established in 1979, when Lanny Wadkins and Larry Nelson went 4-0.)STORY CONTINUES BELOW • • •NOT THE WAY HE’D START: Bubba Watson’s urging the fans to kick up some wild cheering so that he could hit the opening tee shot of his match gathered quite a bit of attention. Ian Poulter, in fact, knew that Watson had orchestrated that Friday morning, so when he stepped to the first tee Saturday morning, the flashy one from England nodded his OK.Watson encouraged the fans to cheer, and so did Poulter as the Englishman stepped over his tee ball. The roars escalated, the flags waved and Poulter swung away. He pulled it into the bunker left, but with the noise still in force, Watson delivered his tee shot down the left side, just into rough.While some wonder if this will become a Ryder Cup tradition, Keegan Bradley apparently hopes not.“For me, personally, I’d probably miss the ball,” Bradley said. “I’m already so jacked up on the first tee that if they started doing that, I don’t know where it would go.”• • •GRAB SOME PINE, KID: When Lee Westwood was held out of the afternoon four-ball, it was just the second session he has missed since he made his Ryder Cup debut in 1997. The Englishman played every session in each of his first five Ryder Cups, then was benched by captain Nick Faldo for Saturday foursomes in 2008. He returned to play every session in 2010, but with his form laboring this time around, Westwood clearly needed to sit out.• • •NO LUCK OF THE IRISH HERE: How badly did things go for those good mates from Northern Ireland, Rory McIlroy and Graeme McDowell?After squandering a comfortable lead and then scratching out a foursomes win Friday morning, McIlroy and McDowell came up empty in their next two games. Losing in a Friday four-ball (to Mickelson and Bradley) and Saturday foursomes (to Jim Furyk and Brandt Snedeker), the one-time World Cup champions played 35 holes, never had a lead and won just five holes.• • •REMEMBER THEM? The Europeans will put out a singles lineup Sunday that includes two players, Peter Hanson and Martin Kaymer, who have played just one match each.In this day of greater team depth, that sort of maneuver is unheard of. Usually everyone gets at least three games – or at least they have since 1999, when captain Mark James famously kept Jean Van de Velde, Jarmo Sandelin and Andrew Coltart on the bench until Sunday singles.Each of them got whacked pretty good that unforgettable Sunday at The Country Club in Brookline, Mass., a key reason the Europeans squandered a lead and the Americans pulled off a dramatic rally.• • •NICE TRY, ANYWAY: It was a nice touch and it offered something to look up at, but whoever hired the plans to do some skywriting didn’t generate the sort of European mojo they had hoped for.As Saturday morning’s first foursomes match of Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson against Justin Rose and Ian Poulter got under way, planes high left smoke that spelled out: “Do it for Seve – go Europe,” and also “Rory’s gonna getcha.”There probably were others, but after a while, the neck started getting stiff from looking skyward."

Phillip)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb6b494200000c101013782.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Sean Martin, Golfweek  MEDINAH, Ill. – Europe withstood Tiger Woods’ best pressure performance of the year as part of a late rally that kept the Ryder Cup within reach.The visitors’ victories in Saturday’s final two matches mean they’ll start singles down, 10-6. They’ll have to win eight of the 12 available points in the Sunday singles to retain the Cup, a tall task, indeed, but not unprecedented. The United States team faced the same deficit before its record-setting comeback in 1999 at Brookline.Woods, who’s struggled on the weekend of golf’s biggest events in 2012, used four birdies in a five-hole stretch to nearly extract his team from a 4-down deficit. Ian Poulter did one better, making birdie on the final five holes to win after trailing 2 down through 12.Woods played Medinah’s 16th and 17th holes in a fashion reminiscent of his former years. He pointed at the hole as his 7-foot birdie putt on the 16th went into the hole, then yelled “Gimme some,” as his tee shot on the par-3 17th settled close to the hole.It wasn’t enough for victory, though. Woods’ ball settled 4 feet from the 17th hole, but Luke Donald hit his tee shot even closer. It was a crucial halve in a 1-up victory for Donald and Sergio Garcia, who’d previously been winless this week.They weren’t the only European stars to redeem themselves as dark settled on Medinah. Poulter’s heroics helped World No. 1 Rory McIlroy salvage a point Saturday. McIlroy could only shake his head and laugh at the Poulter’s bug-eyed celebrations after his putts continued to find the hole, including a 10-footer at 18 that followed Jason Dufner’s birdie-3.“When Poults gets that look in his eyes, especially the week of the Ryder Cup, it’s really impressive,” McIlroy said.McIlroy may be an unrivaled talent, but Poulter is the latest European who reserves his very best for the Ryder Cup. They won, 1 up, over Jason Dufner and Zach Johnson in the day’s final match.“I love the fight of (match play),” Poulter said. “You get to stare your opponent straight in the face, and sometimes that’s what you need to do.“It’s given the whole team a massive boost, to be able to go into tomorrow morning knowing that you can win from this position.”In spite of its late losses, the United States still hasn’t seen Ryder Cup success like this for decades. This is the first time since 1981 that the Americans will enter singles with 10 or more points. By comparison, Europe has started the final session with 10-plus points on five occasions.This is just the third time in the past nine Cups that the United States will enter singles, traditionally the Americans’ strongest session, with the lead. They started the afternoon with an 8-4 lead, the first time since Europe joined the Cup in 1979 that the Americans collected that many points in the first three sessions.The home team never trailed in Saturday afternoon’s first two matches. Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson were 1 up through six holes before rolling off seven birdies in an eight-hole stretch. Five of them belonged to Simpson. The Americans’ 5-and-4 victory over Justin Rose and Francesco Molinari was completed when Watson two-putted for birdie on the par-5 14th.Dustin Johnson and Matt Kuchar earned the Americans’ other point with a 1-up victory over Nicolas Colsaerts and Paul Lawrie. The match was all square on the par-3 17th, where all four balls found the green, giving one player the opportunity to be the match’s MVP. Johnson filled that role, holing a downhill, right-to-left 20-footer for birdie after both Europeans had missed their putts.Woods and Stricker did their best to avoid another loss, but fell, 1 down, to Garcia and Donald. Love used one of his four captain’s selections on Woods’ preferred playing partner.
