0,QUEER VOICES,Should the Supreme Court's Ruling on Gay Marriage Be the Same as Their Ruling on Interracial Marriage?,"Matthew Johnson Harris, Contributor
Performer, author and group fitness instructor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/supreme-court-gay-marriage-interracial-marriage_us_5bafb743e4b0ad769260a692,"Although Mark and I are not planning a wedding anytime soon, it is important that our government support and recognize that our love is as powerful and valuable as that of any heterosexual couple, just as it was for Mr. and Mrs. Loving despite their races.",2013-06-22,2013-06-22-20130621JacquiandMatthewPrideParade.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-06-22-20130621JacquiandMatthewPrideParade.jpg,"Before the Supreme Court handed down its verdict in the case of Loving v. Virginia in June 1967, marriage between the races was an illegal offense in several states. In June 2013, the Supreme Court will have the opportunity to once again face down discrimination and uphold the right of every American, gay or straight, to marry the person they love, when it rules on the constitutionality of California's Prop 8. My name is Matthew Johnson Harris. I am a performer, blogger, and fitness instructor and an African-American man in love with a Caucasian man.My partner, Mark Otto, is the assistant principal at a New York City public high school and a candidate for City Council representing District 7. Mark is devoted to his students and often puts their needs above his own, frequently foregoing his campaign duties to be there for them. He also volunteers to help homeless LGBT youth. Mark's values and actions have nothing to do with his skin color or sexual orientation, but they have everything to do with why I fell in love with him.Over the years, I have endured countless jokes and sarcastic comments from fellow African Americans, which I suspect have less to do with Mark and more to do with their own feelings about relationships with Caucasians. Surprisingly, these tensions exist even in a place as diverse and progressive as New York City! I can only imagine how much more difficult this would be back where I am from in Texas. When Mark went to high school in South Jersey, there were only four students of color and no positive examples of gay relationships. Thankfully, he was able to grow beyond his limited experiences, though he did not find many sympathetic ears or open arms when he returned home years later to share who he had become. However, Mark was not willing to step back in time and is pushing forward instead, living his truth.Our relationship has also been a struggle for our families. My mom had difficulty accepting me as gay, but her own traumatic experiences with white people while growing up in the South made accepting my white partner even more challenging for her. Mark also grew up in a family that forbade interracial relationships, because it was not ""right."" However, to Mark and his cousins, how a person loves is more important than how they look. Thankfully, with time, Mark's family came to accept his homosexuality and our relationship, and I now feel like one of the family. My mom has also made great strides in accepting Mark into ours.Middle Collegiate Church, under the direction of Rev. Dr. Jacqueline Lewis, has also been a major support for us. We actually look forward to going to church every Sunday. I know what you are thinking -- that this is the last place on Earth that would accept us -- but you would be wrong. Middle Collegiate Church is a progressive and socially active community where people of every color, gender, sexual orientation or other classification are welcome. Middle Collegiate Church's message is ""God is love,"" which I believe is a message that many churches espouse but few actually live by. One example of the profound impact that Middle Collegiate Church has had in our lives was at last year's New York Pride Parade, where I was marching with Mark in support of his City Council campaign. Middle Collegiate Church was also there. In fact, they were directly ahead of us, on a bright pink float, and at the head of the float was our amazing pastor, Jacqui, who was hugging parade watchers and telling them how much God loves them. As an African-American woman married to a Caucasian man, she understands the importance of Loving Day as well as the pending outcome of the Prop 8 case on our relationship. Mark and I often wonder how different our childhoods would have been with Middle in our lives, but although we can't go back in time, it gives us hope and joy to know that children (and hopefully our own) will grow up in this supportive, open and loving community.Check out an awesome picture of my pastor and me rocking out at last year's Pride:Although we are not planning a wedding anytime soon, it is important that our government support and recognize that our love is as powerful and valuable as that of any heterosexual couple, just as it was for Mr. and Mrs. Loving despite their races. Thankfully, our country has made significant progress, so the next generation of LGBT youth will grow up in a more open and accepting society. However, as we continue to speak up, there are many who will feel threatened and literally fight back, as evidenced by the recent uptick in hate crimes against the LGBT community. Despite all of the challenges we have faced as gay men and as an interracial couple, nothing will ever stop Mark and me from standing up for love.For more information on Mark Otto's City Council campaign, check out www.markotto2013.com."

""We’re from Philadelphia. Be nice",2013-06-22,"NEW YORK, NY - JUNE 19: Ahmir 'Questlove' Thompson signs copies of his new book 'Mo' Meta Blues' at Barnes & Noble Union Square on June 19, 2013 in New York City. (Photo by Laura Cavanaugh/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb42e19250000cf0038e2e5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Remember that time Questlove sparked a media firestorm after playing ""Lyin' Ass Bitch"" as Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann sauntered onstage on ""Late Night with Jimmy Fallon""? It turns out the Roots drummer was nearly fired over the incident. Questlove describes the episode in his new memoir ""Mo' Meta Blues: The World According to Questlove,"" which is excerpted on Salon. In the passage, he expresses his enthusiasm at the initial idea of finding a derisive song with which to serenade Bachmann -- a tradition none too surprising for a band that, according to Questlove, is particularly meticulous in selecting the perfect walk-on tracks for the show's guests. After months of what Questlove calls Bachmann's ""casual relationship with the truth,"" The Roots declared Fishbone's 1985 song ""Lyin' Ass Bitch"" the perfect ode. The initial reaction to the November 2011 incident, he says, was tepid -- not many recognized the ska song. It wasn't until the next afternoon, when a Twitter user asked Questlove whether it was indeed that track, that the dissension broke out. First it was conservative bloggers lambasting the band (and Fallon); then it turned into a feminist issue, with some left-wingers siding with the condemnation. ""This could be a wrap for us,"" Questlove's manager told him the day the situation escalated.Thanks to the news cycle (it was Thanksgiving week) and a gaffe Bachmann made shortly thereafter regarding national security information, the situation was diffused -- after Fallon issued an apology on Twitter and NBC decided it would start approving The Roots' song selections. But ""some time after that,"" Questlove appeared on ""Watch What Happens Live"" and was asked to name a guest whose ""Late Night"" appearance he was not looking forward to. His answer was not Bachmann, but another powerful female: Tina Fey, who multiple times had failed to wave to The Roots, a staple of guest entrances, during her walk-on. ""Tina Fey, you are never nice to The Roots,"" he recalls saying on ""Watch What Happens."" ""We’re from Philadelphia. Be nice to The Roots!” Another firestorm occurred, with Questlove noting in the memoir that his comments landed him on the front page of HuffPost.Lorne Michaels, executive prodcer of ""Late Night,"" was none too pleased. Questlove writes:This time, Lorne had a fit. “I want him out of here,” he said. “He’s gone.” I thought he was a little angrier than the incident deserved, but it was only seven months after Bachmann, and things had been building. In fact, I think that I was fired for about an hour, until Jimmy begged for my job back.Thankfully, Questlove and The Roots are still with ""Late Night"" today -- by ""the skin of our teeth,"" as the drummer writes. They'll be moving with Fallon to ""The Tonight Show"" when it premires in 2014.Watch Bachmann's ""Late Night"" entrance here:[Read the full excerpt on Salon.]"

That’s not true, of course, but it can be difficult to convince some people otherwise. ""Cats take care of themselves,"" is something I hear a lot, and it makes me wince every time.What’s largely happening is not that our cats are fending for themselves — as so many people assume — but rather that because they’re so good at hiding signs of illness, we don’t realize how sick they are until they’re very sick indeed. And sometimes when I do see cats as a practicing veterinarian, I see not only what people brought them in for — an abscess, perhaps, or a limp or a chronic cough — but life-threatening issues the cats' owners hadn't even noticed.These are serious problems that seem painted in the boldest hues to my eye, yet appear to be invisible to many cat owners. And it happens all the time.Are You Missing the Big Picture? Sometimes, even when I point out these problems, cat owners don’t think they’re as important as I do. They may accept my diagnosis, for example, but not follow up or follow through on treatment plans. It really saddens me to think of the misery these cats are in. Don't be guilty of neglecting your cat's health; check out these five feline health problems people don’t worry about as much as they should — and talk to your veterinarian about any that sound familiar.(Story continues below slideshow)""Chronic"" Doesn’t Mean ""Untreatable"" Ongoing problems with your cat’s health sometimes start slowly and get worse over time. In other words, these issues can creep up on us, so we may not pay much attention to them, or we might overlook them entirely. That’s why I want you to step back right now and look at your cat. Be brutally honest: Are you ignoring chronic health issues that are making your cat miserable? Are you sure you aren’t?If your cat hasn’t seen a veterinarian in a while, it’s time to schedule that comprehensive exam. And take heart: For every one of these often chronic conditions there are things that can be done to stop, treat or even reverse the damage. All you need to do is recognize the problem and work with your veterinarian for your cat’s better health.Also on Vetstreet: 5 Health Problems Dog Owners Ignore How Old Is My Pet in People Years?
