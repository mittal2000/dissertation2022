Things quickly escalate into cringeworthy territory when Rihanna seductively takes off his glasses and he throws up a rock sign, seemingly unsure of what else to do: RiRi is not currently touring, so we can only assume this video is from her Loud tour in 2011, in which she routinely gave lap dances to lucky fans each time she performed the song ""Skin.""

The Cleveland fans appeared to be loyal despite the fact that many of their sports teams have let them down at one time or another. After the way they've acted in recent years, LeBron James might want to take a pass on coming back to Cleveland. However, it seems that LeBron has shown more maturity than the people who cursed his name four years ago. Here are my reasons for and against King James making a return to Cleveland:HistoryIf LeBron goes back to Cleveland, he has a chance to bring to a championship to a city that hasn't had since the 1960s. Let's be real, LeBron can come back to a heroes' welcome. He is a student of the game's history. He knows his place in history will only be heightened is he does the impossible in Cleveland.Hometown Pressure Dorothy from The Wizard of Oz was right when she said ""There's no place like home."" Most of us have no idea what it is like to play for the local sports in/near your hometown. In most cases, that doesn't work out (see Stephon Marbury, Chris Herren, and Eddy Curry). Ask Derrick Rose what it is like to play in his hometown. It may be convenient but it is not fun at all. However, James was the exception. From game one of his rookie season, he was the guy. If anything, he thrived off of playing in front of his hometown fans.Civic Outrage LeBron, or at least his inner circle, saw his jersey burned in effigy after ""The Decision."" That alone should make him stay away from Cleveland. It was the ultimate disrespect. Remember, if he goes back, those fans hated him four years are now his biggest fans. I guess these fans ain't loyal. Dan Gilbert's DisrespectCleveland Cavaliers owner Dan Gilbert might be one of the sorest losers in sports history. He trashed LeBron in a way we've never seen an owner do to a player. The letter that was on the team's website was taken down recently. It was up there for quite a while after LeBron signed with the Heat. Knowing how this guy treated him, why would LeBron go back and make money for this man? I hope Gilbert does the right thing and apologize.The Cleveland Media Narrative In the past week, I've heard words such as ""redemption"" and phrases ""All will be forgiven"" when describing a possible return to Cleveland by James. By using those words, one can ask what does LeBron owe Cleveland? Nothing at all. He doesn't owe them a thing. If anything, they owe him after all he did for the city. If the signs with the Cavaliers, he should be given the key to the city. If LeBron ultimately decides to re-sign with the Heat, Cleveland fans will probably react like a jilted lover who let back in the person who spurned them previously. If that happens, there's no coming back from it. In the eyes of Cleveland fans, LeBron will continue to their own version of Benedict Arnold."

(AP Photo/Markus Schreiber)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc139ff24000033003818cb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Madeline ChambersBERLIN, July 10 (Reuters) - Germany told the CIA station chief in Berlin to leave the country on Thursday in a dramatic display of anger from Chancellor Angela Merkel at the behavior of a close ally after officials unearthed two suspected U.S. spies.The scandal has chilled relations with Washington to levels not seen since Merkel's predecessor opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003. It follows allegations that Merkel herself, who grew up in Stasi-ridden East Germany, was among thousands of Germans whose mobile phones have been bugged by American agents.""Spying on allies ... is a waste of energy,"" the chancellor said in her most pointed public remarks yet on the issue. ""We have so many problems, we should focus on the important things.""Senior conservative supporters denounced U.S. ""stupidity"" and some Americans said spying on their friends had backfired.""In the Cold War maybe there was general mistrust. Today we are living in the 21st century. Today there are completely new threats,"" Merkel said in Berlin, once a key CIA listening post behind the Iron Curtain during the superpower duel with Moscow and now the reunited capital of Europe's most powerful economy.Her spokesman said the request for the top U.S. intelligence official in the Berlin embassy to leave was made in response to questions raised in recent months on U.S. intelligence activity in Germany and prosecutors' investigations.A U.S. government source said the official - whom neither side named - was Berlin station chief for the CIA, the Central Intelligence Agency. A German source said the man would face possible forcible expulsion if he did not leave voluntarily.Washington's embassy and Merkel's office sit a few hundred meters apart. They lie east and west of what was the Berlin Wall, for the removal of which many Germans still give great credit to their U.S. ally - deepening today's sense of betrayal. On Wednesday, Berlin said it had discovered a suspected U.S. spy in the Defense Ministry. That came just days after a German foreign intelligence worker was arrested on suspicion of being a CIA informant and admitted passing documents to a U.S. contact.The scale of public outrage at these revelations has put pressure on Merkel to take action against the United States, an ally whose defense of West Germany in the Cold War long assured Americans a warmer welcome there than elsewhere in Europe.However, there is a limit to what she can do and both sides stressed the need to continue to work closely together. They have done increasingly in recent years, on issues from Iran to Ukraine, as Germany shakes off its postwar reticence in foreign affairs and takes on a role more suited to its economic weight. TRADE DEALExperts said that talks on a free trade deal between the European Union and United States, called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), may be affected; Berlin may push harder on some aspects of the deal in areas such as data protection - long a major concern for Germans after the abuses of the Nazi Gestapo and East German Stasi secret police.""But the idea that Merkel would somehow try to torpedo TTIP is not really likely,"" said Germany expert Hans Kundnani at European Council on Foreign Relations in London.John Kornblum, a former U.S. ambassador to Germany who still lives in Berlin, said: ""I believe the Germans are telling the Americans, 'We want to continue close cooperation but you've pushed us too far and have forced us to react'.""Merkel's government poured scorn on the alleged espionage.Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said the information the United States appeared to have obtained was ""laughable"", contrasting that with the ""disproportionate and serious political damage"" the scandal had caused.Merkel was ""not amused"", Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said, adding: ""This is so stupid, it can only make you weep.""Tensions have risen since revelations last year stemming from documents leaked by Edward Snowden, a contractor with the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA). Those caused Berlin to demand a mutual ""no-spy deal"" which Washington has resisted.""Ever since the NSA disclosures broke last year, the issue of U.S. spying has been an extremely sensitive issue in Germany,"" said Karen Donfried, president of the German Marshall Fund of the United States, which promotes U.S.-European ties.Some Americans asked whether the espionage activities were worth the bother: ""I am not troubled that the United States conducts espionage, even against friendly states,"" said one former senior U.S. intelligence official.""I am troubled when we attempt espionage and do not do it well. We learn nothing and we embarrass a friend and ourselves.""

Now, the torturers are the all-American heroes. From 24 to Zero Dark Thirty, it’s been the good guys who wielded the pliers and the waterboards. We’re not only living in a post-9/11 world, we’re stuck with Jack Bauer in the 25th hour.In 2002, Cofer Black, the former Director of the CIA’s Counterterrorism Center, told a Senate committee, “All I want to say is that there was ‘before’ 9/11 and ‘after’ 9/11. After 9/11 the gloves come off.” He wanted them to understand that Americans now live in a changed world, where, from the point of view of the national security state, anything goes. It was, as he and various top officials in the Bush administration saw it, a dangerous place in which terrorists might be lurking in any airport security line and who knew where else.Dark-skinned foreigners promoting disturbing religions were driven to destroy us because, as President George W. Bush said more than once, “they hate our freedoms.” It was ""them or us."" In such a frightening new world, we were assured, our survival depended in part on brave men and women willing to break precedent and torture some of our enemies for information that would save civilization itself. As part of a new American creed, we learned that torture was the price of security.These were the ruling fantasies of the era, onscreen and off. But didn’t that sorry phase of our national life end when Bush and his vice president Dick Cheney departed? Wasn’t it over once Barack Obama entered the Oval Office and issued an executive order closing the CIA black sites that the Bush administration had set up across the planet, forbidding what had euphemistically come to be called “enhanced interrogation techniques?” As it happens, no. Though it’s seldom commented upon, the infrastructure for, the capacity for, and the personnel to staff a system of institutionalized state torture remain in place, ready to bloom like a desert plant in a rain shower the next time fear shakes the United States.There are several important reasons why the resurgence of torture remains a possibility in post-Bush America:* Torture did not necessarily end when Obama took office.* We have never had a full accounting of all the torture programs in the “war on terror.”* Not one of the senior government officials responsible for activities that amounted to war crimes has been held accountable, nor were any of the actual torturers ever brought to court.Torture Did Not Necessarily End When Obama Took OfficeThe president’s executive order directed the CIA to close its detention centers “as expeditiously as possible” and not to open any new ones. No such orders were given, however, to the Joint Special Operations Command (JSOC), a clandestine force composed of elite fighters from several branches of the U.S. armed forces. JSOC had run its own secret detention centers in Iraq. At Camp Nama, interrogations took place in the ominously named “Black Room.” According to the New York Times, the camp’s chilling motto was “no blood, no foul.” JSOC is presently deployed on several continents, including Africa, where gathering “intelligence” forms an important part of its duties.The president’s executive order still permits “rendition” -- the transfer of a terror suspect to another country for interrogation, which in the Bush years meant to the prisons of regimes notorious for torture. It does, however, impose some constraints on the practice. Such “transfers” must be approved by a special committee composed of the director of national intelligence, the secretary of defense, the secretary of state, the secretary of homeland security, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. It is to be chaired by the attorney general. The committee must not “transfer... individuals to other nations to face torture or otherwise for the purpose, or with the effect, of undermining or circumventing the commitments or obligations of the United States to ensure the humane treatment of individuals in its custody or control.”This last constraint, however, has been in place at least since 1994, when the Senate ratified the U.N. Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, and Degrading Treatment. That did not prevent the rendition of people like Maher Arar, an innocent Canadian citizen sent by the United States to Syria, where he endured 10 months of torture in an underground cell. Nor did it save Binyam Mohammed, whose Moroccan jailers sliced his chest and penis with a scalpel -- once a month for 18 months, according to British human rights lawyer Andy Worthington.Nor has the CIA itself been prepared to end all its torture programs. In his confirmation hearings, Obama’s first CIA director Leon Panetta told members of Congress that “if the approved techniques were ‘not sufficient’ to get a detainee to divulge details he was suspected of knowing about an imminent attack, he would ask for ‘additional authority’ to use other methods.” It is, however, unlikely that such “other methods” could be brought to bear on the spur of the moment. To do so, you need an infrastructure and trained personnel. You need to be ready, with skills honed.Torture, though by another name, still goes on in the American prison complex at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. President Obama came into office promising to close Guantánamo within a year. It’s a promise he repeats occasionally, but the prison is still open, and some detainees are still being held indefinitely. Those who use the only instrument they have to resist their hellish limbo -- a hunger strike -- are strapped into chairs and force-fed. In case you think such “feeding” is a humanitarian act, Guantánamo prisoner Samir Naji al Hasan Moqbel described the experience in a New York Times op-ed in April 2013:“I will never forget the first time they passed the feeding tube up my nose. I can’t describe how painful it is to be force-fed this way. As it was thrust in, it made me feel like throwing up. I wanted to vomit, but I couldn’t. There was agony in my chest, throat, and stomach. I had never experienced such pain before. I would not wish this cruel punishment upon anyone.”The U.S. has a long history of involvement with torture -- from its war in the Philippines at the dawn of the twentieth century on. It has also, as in Latin America in the 1960s, trained torturers serving other regimes. But until 9/11 top officials in this country had never publicly approved of torture. Whatever might happen behind closed doors (or in training sessions provided by the School of the Americas, for example), in public, everyone -- government officials, the press, and the public -- agreed that torture was wrong.That consensus no longer exists today. After 9/11 those “gloves” came off. Waterboarding prisoners who might have information about a plot that could threaten us was a “no brainer” for Vice President Dick Cheney, and he wasn’t alone. In those years, torture, always called “enhanced interrogation techniques” (a phrase the media quickly picked up), became a commonplace, even celebrated, feature of our new landscape. Will it remain that way?We Have Never Had a Full Accounting of All the Torture Programs Used in the “War on Terror”Thanks to the work of persistent reporters, we now know many pieces of the torture puzzle, but we still have nothing like a complete, coherent narrative. And if we don’t know just what happened in those torture years, we are unlikely to be able to dismantle the existing infrastructure, which means we won’t be able to keep it from happening again.In addition, the accounts of journalists and historians are not sufficient, as they don’t bear any government imprimatur. They are not “the official story.” They do not represent an attempt on the part of the government, and hence the nation, to come fully to grips with this past. An official account of what happened could, however, lay the groundwork for a national consensus against the future use of torture.Forty years ago, congressional investigations of the CIA’s Phoenix Program (in which tens of thousands of Viet Cong were tortured and murdered) resulted in some new constraints on the Agency’s activities. President Gerald Ford issued an executive order prohibiting the CIA from engaging in “political assassinations” or experimenting with drugs on human subjects. President Jimmy Carter amended that order to prohibit assassination in general. These edicts, combined with the oversight provided by the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, were supposed to rein in the CIA’s most egregious acts.Nevertheless, we now know that a rejuvenated CIA has run a full-scale torture program, kidnapped terror suspects off global streets, and still oversees drone assassination campaigns in Pakistan and Yemen. In addition, it continues to resist Congressional oversight of its torture activities. As yet, the Agency, tasked with “vetting” a 6,000-page report on its “interrogation methods” prepared by the Senate Intelligence Committee, has refused to allow the release of any part of the account. Even Dianne Feinstein, the committee’s chair, often considered the “senator from national security,” was moved to offer an extraordinary denunciation on the floor of the Senate of the CIA’s interference with committee computers.Recently, the Washington Post reported some leaked details from the report the committee has been struggling unsuccessfully to get released, including information on a previously undocumented form of CIA torture: shoving a prisoner’s head into a tub of ice water or pouring that water all over a person’s body. (Immersion in cold water is a torture method I first came across in 1984 when interviewing a Nicaraguan who had been kidnapped and tortured by U.S.-backed and -trained Contra guerrillas.)We don’t have anything like the full story of the CIA’s involvement in torture, and the CIA is only one agency within a larger complex of agencies, military and civilian. We can’t dismantle what we can’t see.None of the High Government Officials Responsible for Activities That Amount to War Crimes Has Been Held Accountable; Nor Have Any of the Actual CIA TorturersWhen it comes to torture, President Obama has argued that “nothing will be gained by spending our time and energy laying blame for the past,” but this is simply not true. One thing that could be gained would be a public consensus that the United States should never again engage in torture. Another might be agreement that officials who are likely guilty of war crimes should not be allowed to act with impunity and then left free to spend their post-government years writing memoirs or painting themselves bathing.  Retired Major General Antonio Taguba, whose military career was cut short by his report on U.S. abuses at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, wrote in the preface to a June 2008 report by Physicians for Human Rights, “After years of disclosures by government investigations, media accounts, and reports from human rights organizations, there is no longer any doubt as to whether the current administration has committed war crimes. The only question that remains to be answered is whether those who ordered the use of torture will be held to account.”Years later, with a different administration in its second term, this question has been answered. They will not. Nor will the actual CIA torturers, since the Obama Justice Department has dismissed all cases involving their brutal interrogations, even two that resulted in the deaths of prisoners.This is not to say that no one has been sent to prison because of the CIA’s torture programs. Former CIA analyst John Kariakou is presently serving 30 months in federal prison for revealing the name of a covert CIA operative, while blowing the whistle on the Agency’s torture operations. From his prison cell, he has called for a special prosecutor to bring the architects of the torture program to justice.Living in a Cowardly New WorldThe post-9/11 United States is no brave new world, but a terrified one. We are constantly reminded of the dangers we face and encouraged to believe that torture will keep us safe. Americans have evidently seen just enough -- between revelations of fact and fictional representations -- to become habituated to the idea that torture is a necessary cost of safety. Indeed, polls show that Americans are more supportive of using torture today than they were at the height of the “war on terror.”In these years, “safety” and “security” have become primary national concerns. It’s almost as if we believe that if enough data is collected, enough “really bad guys” are tortured into giving up “actionable intelligence,” we ourselves will never die. There is a word for people whose first concern is always for their own safety and who will therefore permit anything to be done in their name as long as it keeps them secure. Such people are sometimes called cowards.If this terrified new worldview holds, and if the structure for a torture system remains in place and unpunished, the next time fear rises, the torture will begin anew.Rebecca Gordon is the author of Mainstreaming Torture: Ethical Approaches in the Post-9/11 United States (Oxford University Press).

(Photo by Elsa/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb768042600003600834b12.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since the news broke over the weekend that Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback, Johnny Manziel, was allegedly photographed in a Las Vegas bathroom tightly rolling a $20 bill, I have been deluged with questions as to the best way to advise a client in this situation. Last week, Manziel also made headlines for partying with Justin Bieber in the pop star's Beverly Hills home. I wrote a number of times in this space how uncommonly gifted he is and how the incidents involving him in his post-Heisman off-season were overblown. I don't represent Manziel, but I have represented rookie quarterbacks from Troy Aikman to Steve Young to Ben Roethlisberger and here is what I advised them.1) Building a career in the NFL is your number one priority. You need to prove to your owner, team executives, coaches, teammates, and the fans that you are totally committed to a work ethic and focus that puts football first. Veteran teammates need to see that the highly paid rookie is willing to fit seamlessly into their peer group. It is your NFL football contract that will give you lifetime security. Rookie salaries are capped, but veteran quarterback contracts are not. The straw that stirs the drink is football. Everything else flows from that. Rookie years are often learning years with numerous mistakes. Adjusting to the speed and talent at the professional level is a necessity.2) Quarterbacks have always been subjected to extra team, and public, scrutiny. The quarterback is generally the team leader and representative. Other positions may get away from the complex for large periods of the off-season, but quarterbacks need to be seen there by coaches. Even though there is no football being played, and this is technically ""time off,"" quarterbacks carry special responsibilities.3) Social media and other platforms of information supply have destroyed the public/private continuum. Every action can be captured by the ubiquitous cellphone and instantly posted for worldwide dissemination. Athletic stars are celebrities and there is great competition to provide breaking news and information concerning them. A whole industry has developed which has nonstop reporting of arrests, domestic problems, money issues, and alcohol and drug abuse by these stars. This requires the athlete to be extra scrupulous in where and how he is seen in public. Venues like Las Vegas can be especially challenging.4) Perception becomes reality. A picture or video of an athlete with a drink in his hand or with scantily clad members of the opposite sex can convey a wild, undisciplined impression. The public will see the video or picture over and over again on all platforms of content supply. That repetition creates the impression that this was not one isolated situation -- the athlete is perceived as that way all the time.5) Athletes are role models whether they wish to be or not. Parents and fans want their children to see athletes projecting positive behavior and values. Players need to be ""stewards of the game."" If an athlete does not want to give peak performance, be discreet in public behavior, gracious in signing autographs, and open and accessible with the press there is an easy solution -- play sports on a sandlot. No criticism, no fans, and none of the incredible benefits that come from professional sports.I have not the slightest doubt that Manziel will be a model practice player and give every effort in games. He is a young man and this is his vacation time; but adjusting to the realities of professional football is a massive undertaking, and perception becomes reality. He may be making his journey more difficult than it needs to be."

Statistics showed that the US economy created 288,000 net new jobs last month, which was much better than expected, and that an average of 231,000 new positions have been added each month since January.

Mostly, I suspect, because it would cost a lot of money to fix. Americans who are unfamiliar with the problems immigrants face and who have never personally had to deal with an immigrant can be excused for not even being aware this problem exists. Conjuring up gauzy images of Ellis Island, such Americans wonder: ""Why don't the immigrants follow the law and come in legally?"" One of the big answers to that question is the monumental backlog they face. A backlog it would take a lot of political effort -- and a whole lot of money -- to fix.Just look at the current political debate to see how hard this problem would be to truly solve. President Obama has deported more people than any other U.S. president. Just ask the immigration reform groups who represent Latinos -- they'll tell you, in no uncertain terms, that Obama is the ""Deporter-in-Chief."" For all this effort (which has cost Obama a lot of political capital with one of his key support demographics) he gets precisely no credit from his political opponents. Under Obama, the Border Patrol's budget has grown enormously. The bipartisan Senate immigration bill would have doubled the number of Border Patrol agents. But, to listen to Republicans, the federal government is doing absolutely nothing about border security, and Obama has actually made things worse.I'm not sure if this is an ideological disconnect on the Republicans' part, since it boils down to a reality they are often uncomfortable admitting: government services cost money. Why, after all, have we had precisely zero detailed plans from the House of Representatives on how to achieve the total border lockdown they so desperately crave? They've had years to come up with some such plan, and early on they announced they'd be passing it separately from any ""comprehensive immigration reform"" bill. So where is the House plan to secure the border? Where's the ""enforcement-only, moats-and-alligators"" Republican plan?It doesn't exist. This could be due to Republican infighting or ineptitude, of course, but that's a stretch because pretty much all of them are on board with the basic concept of shutting the border down as tightly as is humanly and technologically possible. The problem, I suspect, is the price tag. Flooding the border with what would essentially be an occupying force would not come cheap. There's nothing to stop Congress from passing a budget which would provide 24/7 coverage of the border in a ratio of one agent per mile (or per thousand yards, or whatever). This isn't an impossible problem to solve. But it would be incredibly expensive to do so.Obama has just asked Congress for $3.7 billion (a pretty paltry amount, as federal budgets go), and already they're balking. What would they do if he asked for hundreds of billions to completely shut down the border? This, in a nutshell, is why we have yet to see any Republican plan to do so -- because they simply don't want to pay for such an effort.But Democrats aren't blameless in this debate either. Because there's another problem independent of the border, and Democrats don't seem all that interested in solving it -- again, likely because it would take so much money to do so.This is where we return to that Ellis Island imagery. Many Americans have an idea that legally immigrating to this country is just a matter of waiting in a line and then answering a few questions -- the way it used to be. Given this picture, it's easy to wonder why anyone would undertake a dangerous border crossing and then an undocumented existence in America. But the image is wildly out of date. Because while legal immigrants do in fact follow the same basic framework, they must wait in a horrendously long line to do so.In the recent scandal at the V.A. hospitals, the American public was shocked at the waiting times veterans faced. Averages of over 100 days were reported, with some individual horror stories of having to wait years. Now, the two situations are not comparable in any other way, I merely bring them up to compare timelines. Because some people who have followed every American immigration law and legally applied to become American residents have been waiting over two decades to have that hearing and be welcomed in to the United States. These people are not allowed to move to America during this wait, either -- it is supposed to happen in their home country.Now, just for a minute, imagine how you would feel if you called up a government agency (Social Security, perhaps) and were told: ""Well, let's see when you can have an appointment... how does 2035 sound?"" Just imagine hearing that. Puts all those motor vehicle department jokes in perspective, doesn't it? One of the Republican positions on immigration reform is that the 11 million people here already should not have any ""special path to citizenship"" and should instead ""go to the back of the line."" That line is over 20 years long, though -- this is the part they never admit.Some immigrants in differing categories have shorter waits. But even in the fastest categories (such as the new spouse of an American citizen, for example), it can routinely take years to even get an appointment. This is not your great-granddad's Ellis Island, folks. The only other federal agency I've even heard of with such insane paperwork backlogs (and problems) is the Bureau of Indian Affairs.Exactly what it would take to fix the backlog I do not know, beyond ""a lot more political attention and a lot more money."" Would quadrupling the number of officials who handle this paperwork be enough? Would it require ten times more? I have no idea. But whatever the magic number of immigration officials necessary, it's not going to come cheap.The problem, however, is never going to even be addressed until the media and the public decides it is worthy of the ""scandal"" or ""crisis"" label. If there was a hue and cry with plenty of people weeping on camera, perhaps the political will could be found to even start talking about the problem. The answer to the question ""why don't people come here legally?"" is obvious -- because they have to wait over twenty years to do so. Now imagine that a lot of money was thrown at this backlog, to the point that it fell to even ""two or three years."" That's a much more reasonable and humanitarian time to wait, just for the chance to have your case heard. People considering the costs and benefits of legal immigration to America versus illegal immigration would have a whole different set of facts. Waiting a couple of years is one thing, but waiting twenty-plus years is a whole different prospect.The immigration backlog problem will never be solved, though, if it continues never to even be addressed in the political arena. Immigrants don't vote, after all, until they fully complete the process of becoming citizens (once you are granted citizenship, you never have to deal with the immigration service ever again). To put this another way, the only constituents dealing with this problem are family members of people going through it -- none of whom are eager to complain to the government about poor service, in fear of their petition being denied.In the current situation, media references to the backlog (such as they exist) are always rather oblique: ""The children are released to family members until their case is heard, which often takes years."" No emphasis on why it takes years -- it is just mentioned in passing. Now, I'm not saying that fixing this problem would do anything about the current problem at the border with children, and I'm not saying this is an answer to everything that is broken about immigration law -- not by a long shot. But I do wish the backlog was at least a subject for discussion in the whole immigration debate. Currently, Republicans want a border that is completely secure, but they certainly don't want to pay for it (they don't even seem willing to pay a few billion to fix the current problem with the children). Democrats insist that any legislation passed include a path to citizenship for the people already here. But when this was being discussed, I think the shortest pathway I heard was 13 years long. And nothing much was said about fixing the path that was already 20-plus years long. Fixing the backlog should be a centerpiece of any immigration reform, but so far nobody's willing to champion the idea and nobody's willing to pay what it would take. Maybe if the media started calling it a ""crisis"" Congress might start working on an actual fix.Chris Weigant blogs at: Follow Chris on Twitter: @ChrisWeigantBecome a fan of Chris on The Huffington Post"

The highly impoverished rural town has very few jobs and no public transportation. The recession has hit many Americans hard, but the rural Lower Mississippi Delta region has had some of the nation's worst poverty for decades. The mechanization of agriculture and movement of textile plants out of the country has left the region's economy in tatters, leaving generational poverty in its wake. Mississippi's Republican Gov. Haley Barbour has said he will refuse about $56 million in federal government stimulus funds for the unemployment reform package. The package allows states to expand eligibility, potentially assisting thousands of unemployed Americans to weather the recession. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the rate of poverty in Mississippi was more than 20 percent in 2007, the highest rate in the nation.

Bush has long since evaporated under the heat of Republican extremism. Today, more than three-quarters of American conservatives think the poor ""have it easy,"" while fewer than 10 percent believe the ""poor have hard lives"" and receive inadequate assistance according to a recent two-part study by the Pew Research Center.Conservatives told pollsters they believe that the poor have easy lives because ""they get government benefits without doing anything,"" speaking with an ignorance not only of the severe limits of government aid, but also of the burdens the poor face in obtaining food stamps, Medicaid, day care, public housing, and other kinds of government assistance. In fact, more than 80 percent of conservatives also say that the government programs on which the poor so desperately depend do more harm than good. Can about 80 percent of conservatives really be so hard-hearted and insensate that they cannot imagine how profoundly difficult life is for people without enough money to feed their children, fill an essential prescription for an ill parent, or access a safe place to leave an infant while they try to find even a part-time, no-benefits, minimum-wage job before returning home to a slum- and crime-ridden neighborhood? ""Have it easy?"" Really? That is consistent in that more than half of conservatives believe that people are poor because of ""lack of effort,"" while fewer than 30 percent of conservatives believe poverty results from ""circumstances beyond [an individual's] control."" Despite all we have learned over the years about the causes of poverty and related ills, conservatives seem bound and determined to reduce the issue to the simple fact of people making bad decisions and doing bad things.This kind of thinking, that kind of ideology, ought to be greeted with dismay by most charities even if their missions address problems other than poverty. Blaming the victim does not bode well for nonprofit effort. Most problems of concern to charities are the result of major shortcomings in the economy and in society's institutions. There is no fully appropriate path forward if people are seen as the principal source of their own grief. Putting the onus on those who suffer is not only uncharitable, but it also undermines public willingness to support government programs and philanthropic efforts. To help charities fight misconceptions about the poor, let's look at some critical facts: Poverty in the U.S. is higher today than at any time since the 1960s, and includes more than 50 million people. Close to one in four American children live in poverty, the second highest rate of 35 economically advanced nations according to the United Nations. And that figure jumps to more than one of every two children if we include those living in ""low-income"" families of up to twice the poverty line. Is poverty the fault of these children? Folks on the right don't seem to care, with close to 90 percent of conservatives asserting that ""everyone has it in their own power to succeed."" Never mind that research has shown that people who grew up in poverty are much more likely to be poor as adults, and to have children who grow up to be poor. And although most of us also know that race still matters in America, over 80 percent of conservatives say the ""Blacks who can't get ahead are responsible for their own condition."" Again -- really? Rather than blaming the victim, faulting cultural factors or genetics as would many conservatives, science reveals through neurological and other studies that it is the very condition of living in poverty that reproduces it - as well, of course, as external economic forces and malfunctioning institutions. But conservatives tend to ignore scientific findings that contradict their ideology. For instance, 46 percent of Republicans say that global warming is ""just not happening,"" and over 70 percent of serious conservatives say the we have already ""gone too far to protect environment."" They hold to that position in spite of the fact that 99.9 percent of climate scientists say that it is very real and increasingly dangerous. According to another recent study, people ""resist factual information that threatens their defining values.""Beyond poverty-focused and environmental charities, such obstinate ideologically-driven blindness ought to matter to the entire charitable and philanthropic sector. Those who want to build a better world depend on the public's and policymakers' willingness to see truth and to operate with compassion even when they don't.There's too little of either among today's conservatives. This problem grows: ""Republicans and Democrats are more divided along ideological lines - and partisan antipathy is deeper and more extensive - than at any point in the last two decades."" Republicans are significantly more likely than Democrats to see those with opposing views as a ""threat to the nation's well-being."" This poses a real challenge to charities seeking to improve the way our society operates in service both to the neediest and to the rest of us, as well as to the planet. And we're not doing too well in those philanthropic efforts.Sadly, that well-being is suffering. According to the Social Progress Imperative, a relatively new initiative that measures multiple dimensions of social progress and human well-being in over 100 countries, the U.S. doesn't even rank in the top ten overall (we're sixteenth), and ranks a disappointing twenty-third in the category of Basic Human Needs (nutrition, basic health care, shelter, etc.) and a dismal thirty-sixth in the category of Foundations of Well-Being (school enrollment, phone/internet access, life expectancy, ecosystem health, etc.) in spite of doing a lot better than other countries in protecting the rights, freedoms, choice and other opportunities available to many US citizens.America needs to do a lot to make progress and that requires both nonprofit and government activity. Although about 80 percent of those holding strongly conservative views think regulations do more harm than good, it should be clear to the majority of Americans that our people, communities and planet need additional safeguards from those who favor private interests over the public good. The ""mediating institutions--voluntary associations, local government, church [sic], and, above all, the family"" so valued by conservatives do not alone have the power to solve the extensive problems we face as a nation. The good news is that beyond those with extreme and polarizing ideology, there is a large center of about 40 percent of Americans who can be enlisted by charities to help make social progress. Although that percentage has shrunk by about a fifth in the last two decades, it is to them that nonprofits must speak.Charities and foundations need to go beyond service provision and enlist larger numbers of Americans free of ideological myopia to support programs and policies that will remediate the problems that bedevil the nation. That requires helping people to become more engaged civically and in democratic life. We know that those on the extremes are more likely to vote and to be involved in political processes. Ideology and polarization can be mitigated only by activating those now in the middle. Unless charities and foundations turn to that task, the causes, communities and people they serve will continue to suffer as public discourse, decision-making and action move further away from truth and compassion.Versions of this piece also appear in The Chronicle of Philanthropy and PhilanTopic."

This was the 12th arrest in an investigation of the illegal release of tickets originally allocated to players, federations and NGOs in the black market.Brazilian officials found 900 telephone calls between the gang leader, an Algerian national, and Whelan. One of the shareholders of Match Hospitality is Philippe Blatter, nephew of FIFA's President Joseph Blatter. The gang earned about U.S. $100 million, Brazilian officials say.Fabio Barucke, the detective leading the investigation, said in a press conference they are now investigating links between the gang and FIFA officials. He accused FIFA of diverting tickets to sponsors and partners to guarantee scarcity and encourage huge profits.""Only a small portion of the tickets have been allocated to the people,"" he said.The scheme has been active for at least four World Cups, as the British journalist Andrew Jennings has denounced in many of his investigations for the BBC. ""Ray Whelan will have to talk,"" writes Jennings. ""He knows everything to be known about World Cup ticket rackets. He knows which of football's leaders get their bundles of tickets to resell into the black market. He has been at the heart of the business for nearly two decades.""Arresting the CEO of a company intimately tied to FIFA was a brave gesture -- and unprecedented in the history of World Cups. Though the Judge agreed to release Whelan on a U.S. $2,250 bail, he had to deliver his passport to Brazilian authorities and can't leave the country while the investigation in ongoing.So now that supporting the Brazilian football team is no longer an option, we can all help to support and demand justice be done. If there is something we have learned from the past year, it is that only with strong popular pressure will justice be served."

Scientists said the area is home to 70,000 to 90,000 nesting sites per year and comprises 84 percent of all known nesting areas for the large sea turtles.The designated area includes some reproductive areas directly off of nesting beaches from North Carolina through Mississippi, and breeding habitat in Florida, as well as 88 nesting beaches in six states which account for 48 percent of an estimated 1,531 miles (2,464 km) of coastal beach shoreline used by loggerheads.""Given the vital role loggerhead sea turtles play in maintaining the health of our oceans, rebuilding their populations is key as we work to ensure healthy and resilient oceans for generations to come,"" said Eileen Sobeck, assistant NOAA administrator for fisheries.Protection doesn't limit public access to the designated areas but requires that any federal activity in the waters off nesting sites, such as drilling or fisheries, must be further scrutinized for possible impact on the turtles.The loggerhead is the most common sea turtle in the southeastern United States and migrate thousands of miles in U.S. waters but nest on Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico shores.They can live 40 years or longer, weighing up to 250 pounds (113 kg), and were first listed as endangered in 1978.Loggerheads face persistent threats from fishing gear, pollution and climate change, said Amanda Keledjian, a marine scientist at Oceana, a Washington-based nonprofit environmental group, one of three organizations that sued the government.Scientists estimate about 50,000 loggerhead sea turtles are caught in shrimp trawls each year in the Gulf of Mexico, she said.Endangered or threatened sea turtles that frequent Atlantic or Gulf of Mexico waters also include Kemp's ridley, leatherback and green sea turtles.

Lamar Smith, R-Tex., speaks during a news conference on Capitol Hill, in Washington, Tuesday, Aug. 10, 2010, announcing a resolution condemning the Proposition 8 decision in California on same-sex marriage.

Republicans on Tuesday and Wednesday laid out a number of demands they want met before they approve funding to deal with the influx in illegal border crossings. For many, the issue boiled down to the same talking points GOP members have been using for months on immigration reform: Obama isn't enforcing the law, they said, and they can't work with him on anything until he does. ""I’d be happy to give the President $3.7 billion to secure the border if I thought he’d actually do it,"" Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Texas) said in a statement. ""Congress shouldn’t give President Obama a single penny until we see him use the current resources to secure the border, increase interior enforcement, and reduce illegal immigration,"" he added later.The request includes funding meant to increase border patrol capacity and speed deportations -- ostensibly the exact things Republicans say they want. Obama asked Congress for $1.1 billion for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and $433 million for Customs and Border Protection, both of which focus on apprehending and removing unauthorized immigrants. The request also includes $64 million for the Department of Justice, which would allow the department to work through removal cases more quickly. Many Republicans say the Obama administration's immigration policies are to blame for the crisis happening at all, and showed little interest in approving his funding request unless he changes the way he enforces the law. Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), whose committee handles immigration matters, said Tuesday on CNN that the request was ""a slap in the face to the taxpayers of the United States."" He said in a separate statement that Republicans would support changes to current law and additional funding, but that it wouldn't work ""if President Obama continues to ignore the law."" House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said at a press conference on Wednesday that he was waiting to see what the Appropriations Committee and a working group on the border crisis said after reviewing the request. But he indicated he didn't think the request would be sufficient to fix the situation.""If we don't secure the border, nothing is going to change,"" he said. ""If you look at the president's request, it's all about continuing to deal with the problem. We've got to do something about sealing the border and ending this problem so that we can begin to move on with the bigger question of immigration reform."" One problem is that Obama isn't thwarting the law by declining to immediately deport unaccompanied minors from Central America -- he's following it. The influx has been so difficult for the government to handle in part because of a 2008 law that gives special protections to unaccompanied minors and keeps those from countries other than Mexico and Canada from simply being questioned and immediately sent back. Instead, children are transferred to the Department of Health and Human Services, although they remain eligible for deportation. The process is expensive, particularly given the number of children who have been apprehended at the border, and $1.8 billion of the funding request would go to HHS to care for those minors. Many Republicans said they could not support a funding increase unless there is also a change to the law that gives protection to unaccompanied minors. The Obama administration has indicated it may pursue such a change, but did not send a request for the legislation when it asked for increased funds on Tuesday. ""I'm all for changing that law and sending them back,"" Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) said on CNN's ""Crossfire"" Tuesday. ""I'm opposing that money because the money is going to be asked for again next year."" Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) told reporters in a meeting at his office Wednesday that ""there will be a vote"" on a bill dealing with the border issue but declined to get into specifics. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) told The Huffington Post that they are already holding preliminary conversations with Republicans to see what they ""might be willing to accept."" Don Stewart, the spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), said Republicans want to see legislative language from the White House for more specifics on how the money would be spent. Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), notably a member of the group that drafted a comprehensive immigration reform bill last year, said he would not support a funding increase unless other changes were attached. ""Unless there are provisions in that legislation which would bring an end to this humanitarian crisis, then I cannot support it,"" he said. ""I cannot vote for a provision which will then just perpetuate an unacceptable humanitarian crisis that's taking place on our southern border."" Howard Fineman contributed reporting."

(Photo by Matej Divizna/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb466ee3c000020010c99c0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After making headlines for his now-infamous anti-Semitic rant during his arrest in 2006 and again in 2012 when his horrific fight with then-girlfriend Oksana Grigorieva leaked, Mel Gibson's name was forever tainted in Hollywood. But he's hoping that it doesn't end up that way for Shia LaBeouf.In an interview with Indiewire published July 8, Mel Gibson expressed sympathy for LaBeouf in light of the 28-year-old's recent struggles.""When I see someone like Shia LaBeouf with the bag on his head and stuff, my heart goes out to the poor guy. I think he's suffering in some way,"" Gibson said. Gibson was referring to an incident in February when LaBeouf showed up to the ""Nymphomaniac"" premiere with a bag over his head that read ""I am not famous anymore."" LaBeouf's more recent troubles include getting kicked out of a Broadway play and subsequently being arrested by New York police. ""People are in line to sort of point the finger at him and say that he's this, that, or the other. It's easy to judge. But I'm sure he's going through some kind of personal, very painful, cathartic thing that he has to exorcise and get out there,"" Gibson continued.But Gibson is hopeful that LaBeouf will turn his life around. ""He'll probably play it out and come back ... He'll be all right. I actually like the kid. I think he's good."""
