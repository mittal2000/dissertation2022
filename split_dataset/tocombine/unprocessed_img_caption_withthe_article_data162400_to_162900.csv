This sort of news is fairly common.",2013-02-24,Ilham Aliyev - The President of Azerbaijan at the opening of Shahdagh Resort,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb8b32500003600362e1f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"The last time I travelled to Azerbaijan, I said I wanted to see so much more. The Spring celebrations were in full swing and the capital, Baku, was about to host the Eurovision Song Contest. I had explored Baku and its vicinity, so rich in culture and history. The friendliness of the place was quite staggering to be honest. As you wander you can feel that Azerbaijan is growing into a major attraction. There are huge plans coming to fruition around every corner. While I was in the country, the President was opening a vast ski resort in the Shahdagh region complete with five star facilities. This sort of news is fairly common.Baku is, after all, preparing to host the very first European Games in 2015.I was here to see that ""more"" I'd wanted so I headed north to the mountains. Before heading up there I was lucky enough to get some direct interviews with Government officials to gain their thoughts on the future of Azerbaijan, the great events it has hosted and the future with more events and tourism.I asked the Minister of Tourism and Culture, Mr. Abulfaz Qarayev what he thought of recent publicity and what plans there are ahead:2012 was marked with some very significant developments for travel and tourism in Azerbaijan. As you all know, Azerbaijan hosted two major international events past year - Eurovision 2012 and U-17 FIFA Women's Football World Cup. According to feedback we have from the organizers both events were organized and implemented successfully. Members of teams, coaches, performers, journalists from all over the Europe and world were quite impressed by the capital Baku and the country. It helped to maintain the positive trend of tourist arrivals, as there were some worries on our side that tourist flows might decline in 2012 from Europe and some other parts of the world due to economic and financial crisis. At this time, Azerbaijan is still on its path to become one of the primary tourist destinations in Europe, and these major events and many other important events helped a lot to showI have seen for myself some amazing history and stories in Azerbaijan. Religious tolerance is a striking thing to see as you travel; religions lost in time in other parts of the world still live together here. Mr. Ali Hasanov, Head of Public Affairs Department of Presidential AdministrationAzerbaijan although a small country with population of 9 million, and the size of Austria, yet has a lot of unique cultural and historical features. Azerbaijan has always been the meeting point civilizations -- it is the country where East meets West, Christianity meets Islam, it is a middle of historical Silk Way, and still part of Europe. Azerbaijan is one of few countries in the world where Christianity, Islam and Judaism live in peace, we are proud for being tolerant and hospitable people. Until recently, the world didn't know where Azerbaijan was. But now everybody knows Azerbaijan and its capital Baku. This became obvious after Eurovision 2012 - Europe's major song contest. People in the West are now thinking if Azerbaijan is Europe or East. We welcome all those who have an interest in Azerbaijan to visit our country and to experience the country where ancient history coexists with modernity. We are proud for being the first country in the East to grant election rights to women, in 1918, established schools for women, opened opera theatres and we are the first democracy in entire East.It was time to head to the mountains. I had a lot to see and enjoy with plenty to learn. In my next post I will be highlighting a beautiful mountain region along with the vast culture and history of the area."
1,WELLNESS,Hollywood's Take on Grief,"Fredda Wasserman, Contributor

As large a role as football plays in American life, Hollywood has typically focused its cameras on the field of play, where the dramatics of gridiron battle are self-evident. ￂﾓSilver Linings Playbook,ￂﾔ was recently nominated for five Spirit Awards and is widely expected to be a best picture Oscar contender. (AP Photo/The Weinstein Company, JoJo Whilden)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd8143c0000320009ec2c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"From Les Miserables to Silver Linings Playbook to Flight, death and grief are major themes in this year's Oscar nominated films. The often taboo topic of how people deal with the death of someone close seems to have also reached a fever pitch in TV shows such as Private Practice, and Go On. The film makers and writers must be applauded for daring to expose viewers to such intimate portrayals of the grief process. Consider these four characters from this year's films and TV shows that illustrate a wide variety of grief reactions:Guilt and IsolationWilliam (Flight): William or ""Whip"" Whitaker was the pilot of a plane that malfunctioned. In his attempts to save the lives of everyone on board, William completes an incredibly difficult landing maneuver, Although 96 out of the 102 people survive, William is left with mixed emotions. Part of him feels relieved and capable, while another part of him feels guilty and responsible for the deaths of the flight attendant with whom he had a romantic relationship and five others. Already a struggling alcoholic and drug user, Whip begins drinking and taking drugs more heavily and even denies in court that he has done anything wrong. Succumbing to the enormity of his guilt, William pushes away the people trying to help him, just when he needs them the most. AngerAnne (Go On on NBC): Anne, recently widowed after the death of her partner, worries that if she lets her sadness out, she'll slow down to the point where she will not be able to function. She channels her energy into being angry, infuriated that her partner was the stay-at-home-mom, while she had to take on the role of breadwinner. Anne resents that everything is so much harder now and struggles with the unfairness of it all. Like many people, Anne finds that anger, a natural reaction to grief, is sometimes easier to express than sadness. Taking a Grief DetourTiffany (Silver Linings Playbook): Towards the beginning of the movie, we are introduced to Tiffany, a young woman grieving the death of her husband who was killed in a car accident five years prior. Tiffany's initial response to her all-consuming grief is to sleep with just about everyone she works with. This action serves to distract her from her grief, and get her fired, but does little for healing her heart. We later witness Tiffany's self-defeating, risky behavior subside as she recognizes and expresses her feelings and reengages with life. Finding Hope for the FutureViolet (Private Practice on ABC): After struggling throughout the season with the sudden death of her husband, Violet recognizes in the series finale that being a widow does not mean that her life is over. Her friend, Dr. Sam Bennett, inspires Violet to write a book, and helps her see that she has a full life ahead of her. Violet makes a commitment to invest more time and energy into raising her son and remain open to the possibility of finding love again one day. Although the concept of again having a life filled with happiness and joy seems impossible at first, little by little healing happens and hope for the future emerges.Implications for our LivesDeath is a universal part of the human experience; and grief is a natural response to a death. Each of these films provides a realistic, up close and personal glimpse into the world of grief as we observe the diverse physical, emotional, behavioral, and spiritual responses to the deaths that occur. Viewers are given the opportunity to grapple with their own attitudes and reactions as they reflect upon the characters' grief experiences, gradually making their way through the tidal waves of feelings, and finding hope for the future.For more on death and dying, click here."
2,WELLNESS,Oscar Psychology: Why We Love Watching The Academy Awards,Laura Schocker,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oscar-psychology-academy-awards_us_5b9cd983e4b03a1dcc826a65,"It only makes sense, then, that we'd want to follow them to the Academy Awards, to see who they're dating, what they're wearing",2013-02-24,"Oscar statues are viewed in preparation one day before the 85th Academy Awards on February 23, 2013 in Hollywood, California . AFP PHOTO/ROBYN BECK (Photo credit should read ROBYN BECK/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd98326000035007fa512.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This Sunday, tens of millions of Americans will tune in for the finale of this year's awards season: The Academy Awards. No matter how much we complain about the show, the truth is that many of us will still be glued to the television screen: from the red carpet to host Seth MacFarlane's opening act to the final ""And the Oscar goes to..."" to the morning-after fashion analysis. But why exactly are we so drawn to the Oscars? And, especially for those of us who don't identify as movie buffs, what is it about these shows that pull us in, year after year?The answer, in part, is that we're social animals, explains Stuart Fischoff, Ph.D., professor emeritus of psychology at California State University and senior editor of the Journal of Media Psychology. And, as such, we're more likely to focus our attention on the ""alpha"" males and females in the pack, whether they be royalty, heroes or, in this case, celebrities. ""These are people who we pay attention to because, in one way or another, they influence our lives,"" he says. ""How they dress, how they speak, what they like, what roles they play -- they are profoundly influential ... These people are really so much a part of our cultural layers of who is important and who is less important.""It also doesn't hurt that celebrities tend to be easy on the eyes. ""They're sexy, beautiful people. And we like to watch sexy, beautiful people,"" says Fischoff, who also writes ""The Media Zone"" blog. ""It's kind of like a legitimate voyeurism.""What's more, through the magic of movies, the audience can start to believe the actors are the roles they play, and both fantasize about what it would be like to know them and identify with their struggles. ""We borrow the director's eye or the camera's eye and we see Anne Hathaway [as Fantine in Les Misérables] getting her hair cut. We see the tears, the quiver in her jaw. We see the pain in her eyes. That's an incredibly intimate moment,"" says Robert Simmermon, Ph.D., a psychologist in Atlanta Ga., specializing in media psychology. ""We're going through it with her in real time in that sense ... Obviously it's a character, but the experience becomes very real.""As we get wrapped up in a film, we can start to forget entirely that it's not real -- we no longer distinguish the script, the scene, the director, the camera. It's all about the character. And movies have what Fischoff calls ""autobiographic resonance."" ""The movies I see and the people I see talk to me, they talk to my life, how I feel about things,"" he tells HuffPost. ""We identify with these people and therefore they have relevance to how we do our lives.""Through that identification, we may begin to feel like we know these characters and, by extension, the actors who play them. ""It's like unrequited love, except it's unrequited intimacy and friendship,"" he says.A world of DVDs and streaming online video only amplifies that connection. ""[Actors are] in the privacy of our own homes -- in our living rooms, in our bedrooms. They've seen us naked. They've been in our bathrooms. They're in every part of our private space,"" Simmermon says. ""That's how we identify with them.""It only makes sense, then, that we'd want to follow them to the Academy Awards, to see who they're dating, what they're wearing, what they say. ""There's a huge part of us that never gets out of middle school,"" Simmermon says. ""Hollywood is the biggest middle school in the world. It's about the popular kids, who can go to which party, who's the favorite couple ... We can all get sucked into it.""We watch for gaffes (the classic wardrobe malfunction), root for our favorites, shake our heads at our least favorites and, perhaps above all, look for a rare glimpse of humanity behind the glamor (both Fischoff and Simmermon pointed to Sally Field's now-famous acceptance speech line, ""You like me you, really like me,"" as one of those moments of true authenticity).The awards also underscore the universal appeal of the underdog -- it's no coincidence, for instance, that so many are pulling for Ben Affleck's Argo to win Best Picture after a widely perceived slight from the Academy for a Best Director nomination. We like the underdog because we are the underdogs, Simmermon says. ""Most of us live pretty regular lives, but we've all had struggles ... It's about that tenacity to keep trying,"" he tells HuffPost. ""I guess it all comes down to, we personalize with these dreams. They're bigger than life dreams. It's rejuvenating, it's exciting. It's like our team winning the Super Bowl when we are cheering at home.""While most of us won't score an Oscar in our lifetimes, we can appreciate the pleasure of winning vicariously. ""If I'm rooting for a movie or I'm rooting for an actor and they win, I win,"" Fischoff says. ""My taste is right on. And people like to have their taste validated or their hero validated.""Win or lose, the Academy Awards, at the most basic level, is a yearly tradition that gives us all a chance to gossip harmlessly with friends and connect with those around us. ""It allows us to participate in a large-scale communal event. Many people discuss the nominations for actors or movies with their family and friends. They have opinions on whether the awardees were deserving afterwards,"" Steven Meyers, professor of psychology at Roosevelt University in Chicago, Ill., tells HuffPost in an email. ""The Academy Awards allows us to participate in these conversations and connect with others.""It's also a chance to escape, even if just for a few hours on Sunday evening. ""These people are fantasy feeders,"" Fischoff says. ""That's what celebrities do, they really add some spice to our life ... It gets us out of the mundane and our ordinary lives."""

Sit-ins were an integral part of the nonviolent strategy of civil disobedience, ultimately leading to the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. It was a method, largely utilized by students, where participants would sit at a lunch counter until they were served. If they were taunted, they did not respond; if they were hit, they did not retaliate, and they oftentimes dressed in their Sunday best. By August 1961, more than 3,000 students across the country were arrested.Several sit-ins gained national attention and notoriety, such as the demonstration at a Woolworth's store in Greensboro, North Carolina on February 1, 1960, when four students from North Carolina A&T refused to leave the premises until they were served. The men, who eventually became known as the Greensboro Four, were joined by hundreds of demonstrators and attracted attention from television stations and newspapers, helping to spread the movement across the country. Three years later, a similar sit-in at a Woolworth's in Jackson, Mississippi, was one of the most violent demonstrations on May 28. Anne Moody wrote about the experience in her book ""Coming of Age in Mississippi.""This was the most violently attacked sit-in during the 1960s and is the most publicized. A huge mob gathered, with open police support while the three of us sat there for three hours. I was attacked with fists, brass knuckles and the broken portions of glass sugar containers, and was burned with cigarettes. I'm covered with blood and we were all covered by salt, sugar, mustard, and various other things.Take a look at the photo and share your thoughts in the comments section below. "

Bonuses for “front-office” financial professionals -- or bankers and traders -- declined 38 percent in 2012 from 2011, according to a recent survey from eFinancialCareers.com. Though their bonuses didn’t take as big of a hit, “middle-office” workers, like risk and compliance staff employees, saw their bonuses fall by 15 percent, the survey found. The drop continues a trend of declining bonuses on Wall Street. Financial industry workers’ bonuses took a hit in 2011, with the average bonus falling to $121,150 from $138,940 in 2010. Wall Street staffers are suffering in other ways too; Morgan Stanley cut 6,000 jobs last year, according to the Wall Street Journal and Citigroup announced in December that it planned to slash 11,000 jobs. Heightened scrutiny on Wall Street pay in the wake of the financial crisis has pushed many institutions to change their pay practices. More respondents than last year reported having their bonus deferred, according to the eFinancialCareers survey. Morgan Stanley, for example, paid its bonuses in installments with the last coming in January 2016, according to the Wall Street Journal. The benefit of deferred compensation, proponents argue, is that it discourages staffers from taking big risks if they know their employer still owes them money. Other banks have taken steps to rein in bonuses perceived as outlandish. Citi announced earlier this week that it would tie top executives’ bonuses more closely to to performance, according to The New York Times. "

The average price of regular gas across the state was nearly $4.49 a gallon, the highest in the nation, according to AAA's Daily Fuel Gauge report. (AP Photo/Gary Kazanjian)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2e9a12100006401c7a440.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The title of the article in Friday's Wall Street Journal -- ""Drivers Feel Pinch of Climbing Gas Prices"" -- says it all. Yet we have an anomaly in our courts, irresponsibly supported by the executive and legislative branches of our government, in the manner that our courts interpret Sovereign Immunity and, in turn, its impact on our day to day lives. Technically speaking, Sovereign Immunity is a legal doctrine by which the sovereign state cannot commit a legal wrong and is therefore immune from civil suit or legal prosecution. Yet here it has been extended by our courts, with the backing of our executive branch and the acquiescence of our legislative branch, to giving certain national commercial entities a free pass overriding our laws such as those relating to anti-trust and commercial collusion.Quite incredibly sovereign immunity has for years been extended to the machinations of OPEC cartel members and their very significant business interests in the United States. Just last May a turning valve ceremony took place at Port Arthur, Texas, bringing on stream the expansion of the Motiva Refinery, now the largest refinery in the United States owned and operated jointly by Saudi Aramco (Saudi Arabia's national oil company) and Shell (much in the manner of the Aramco-Shell ""SASREF"" refinery operating at the very heart of Saudi Arabia's petrochemical industry, Jubail Industrial City).But OPEC's tentacles extend further into U.S. gasoline and petroleum product production and their markets. Here we have happily gouging American consumers through the OPEC-manipulated price of oil, the vast presence of Petroleos de Venezuela's (PDVSA, Venezuela's nationally owned oil company) with refineries and facilities in Houston and Corpus Christie Texas; Lamont, Ill.; Paulsboro, N.J.; Lake Charles and Chalmette in Louisiana; Savannah, Ga., and St. Croix in the Virgin Islands refining and marketing gasoline, jet fuel, diesel, petrochemicals, lubricants, asphalt. All together with a capacity of more than a million barrels per day -- this while owning and running more than 13,000 gas stations throughout the U.S. and Puerto Rico.Here we have two major players in the U.S. gasoline market whose parent company's objective is not to produce competitively priced gasoline and petroleum products to service the U.S. market and its pinched consumers, but rather to keep the price of oil high and have the quoted price of WTI (West Texas Intermediate -- the U.S. benchmark on the commodity exchanges) quoted at levels approaching those of Brent Crude (the more international and significantly higher benchmark price quoted on the London Exchange). Being tied to the OPEC Cartel, their objectives can readily be alleged to be at clear variance with those of a stand alone refinery needing to source its crude oil in the marketplace. The stand alone refinery would do its utmost to procure the least expensive source of crude and do all it could to reduce the price of oil in its procurement policies thereby servicing the gasoline market at the most competitive price possible. Not so with the OPEC Frankensteins given their cozy and open access to our markets whose objectives could be reasonably construed to push up the price of the core input of the refining industry, crude oil. Would the integrated U.S.-based producers of crude oil and refined petroleum products such as ExxonMobil, Chevron, etc., collude as to the output and pricing of their crude oil production they would be behind bars long since. A close Justice Department look at the machinations of crude oil procurement of Motiva and Citgo could yield some significant and oil market moving/gasoline pricing results.Astonishingly, our government, most especially the executive branch, has been a staunch defender of the court's interpretation of sovereign immunity as it applies to the distortions vested on the American consumer by OPEC national oil companies. In the case of Spectrum Stores Inc. v Citgo Petroleum Corporation (case no. 09-20084 -C.A. 5. Feb. 8, 2011), alleging that Citgo, as an oil production company in its affiliation with the OPEC member PDVSA, was in violation of the Sherman Act and Clayton antitrust act, the court ruled for Citgo citing the following rationale:""Because the political question doctrine is jurisdictional, we address it first. When we do so, we discern that the complaints before us effectively challenge the structure of OPEC and its relation to the worldwide production of petroleum. Convinced that these matters deeply implicate concerns of foreign and defense policy, concerns that constitutionally belong in the executive and legislative departments, we conclude that we lack jurisdiction to adjudicate the claims. We hold alternatively that the complaints seek a remedy that is barred by the act of state doctrine, that is, an order and judgment that would interfere with sovereign nations' control over their own natural resources. Accordingly, we affirm the judgment dismissing the complaints.""Astoundingly, in total disregard of the financial and economic damage that the OPEC-related oil companies are inflicting on both national and international economies our executive branch had gone full bore in siding with the courts decision by having the Justice Department, the Commerce Department, the Department of Energy, State Department submit amicus briefs in support of the Appellees (Citgo et. al.) and in affirmation of the judgment.The legislative branch of our government has been more proactive on this issue (please see (""NOPEC 'No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act': A Presidential Issue and Test of Political Integrity"" 09.10.12) from which the following is taken:""Yet some years ago, in 2007, there was a genuine effort to change the equation in a fundamental way when Congress voted overwhelmingly, in defiance of the oil lobby and their allied interests for the NOPEC bill, so named because it would allow the international oil cartel, OPEC, and its national oil companies operating outside the law, hiding behind our sovereign immunity shield, to be sued and held accountable for what are clearly anti-competitive attempts to limit the world's supply of petroleum and the consequent impact on oil prices.Regretfully the Obama administration has done little on this issue as pointed out in the blog post above, other than have its agencies file amicus briefs in support of our courts current interpretation of Sovereign Immunity while American consumers struggle with gas prices that have risen by 50 cents in the past month alone.It is incredible that at this time and under these circumstances we are giving a free pass to members of the OPEC coven, something we denied to John D. Rockefeller and his Standard Oil. At that time the reining in of the Standard Oil monopoly was an act of national policy that was key to creating a freely competitive marketplace that was essential to America's emerging industrial ascendancy."

Diesel fuel cost an average $4.17 per gallon, up more than 10 cents from two weeks earlier.Gasoline prices have now risen 53.71 cents, or 16.5 percent, in the last nine weeks, with most of that gain coming since late January. The survey of about 2,500 gas stations comes out every other or every third week.Trilby Lundberg, who conducts the survey, said prices have risen mainly because refiners have idled capacity to perform maintenance ahead of the spring and summer driving seasons.But she said the latest increase masks a drop in wholesale prices over the last few days.""I think I can see a light at the end of the tunnel,"" she said in a phone interview. ""Refiners are passing through some of these cuts to their marketing and retail customers. In my expectation, retailers will be able to pass through wholesale price cuts in the near future. There is reason to suppose that price increases will be smaller, or maybe even cease.""Brent crude prices closed Friday at $114.10 a barrel, down 3 percent for the week, while U.S. crude futures settled at $93.13 a barrel, down 2.8 percent.The direction of prices will depend in part on the ability of retailers to rebuild margins, the difference between what it charges and pays for gas, taking taxes into account.Lundberg said the typical margin on regular grade gas this year fell as low as 8 cents a gallon, an unsustainable level, as retailers resisted passing on all their costs to motorists.But she said the typical margin has rebounded to slightly more than 13 cents a gallon, close to the 14 cents to 15 cents more common in 2011 and 2012.Gasoline prices per gallon peaked in 2012 at $3.9671 on April 6, and the all-time high remains $4.112 on July 11, 2008. Lundberg said neither level appears to be in jeopardy in the near future.The lowest average price for a gallon of unleaded gas in the 48 contiguous U.S. states was $3.23 in Billings, Montana, and drivers in Los Angeles, paid the most to fill the tank at $4.29 a gallon, Lundberg said.The survey is done in Camarillo, California.

In December 2008, two of Bernard Madoff's most loyal employees met on a Manhattan street corner and fretted over a closely held secret that the rest of the world would learn about eight days later: that their boss, Madoff, was a con man for the ages. The exchange was recounted for the first time in a newly rewritten indictment this week expanding the case and charges against five defendants headed for a trial next year. The indictment brings into sharper focus the final few years of a fraud the government says dated to at least the early 1970s, two decades before Madoff claimed it began and well before 1992, when the government said in its original case against the defendants that the conspiracy began.

In an email penned from jail, one of the biggest Ponzi schemers in history told Fox Business Network that those responsible for recouping his victims’ money should keep going after the banks where he had accounts. “The Banks had to know what I was doing regarding the fraud,” Madoff wrote in the email.   (Click over to Fox Business to read the full email)  Madoff, who was sentenced to 150 years in prison in 2009 for his multi-billion dollar scheme, has made this claim before. He told The New York Times in an interview from prison in 2011 that the banks ""had to know"" he was committing fraud, but chose to turn a blind eye. Madoff had dealings with a variety of banks and hedge funds, and burned Madoff investors have tried to recoup funds from some of them. Madoff held an account at JPMorgan Chase that he used to shuffle money between offices in London and New York. In 2011, two Madoff investors sued the bank for $19 million, claiming they aided in his fraud, according to CNN. At the time, a JPMorgan spokesman dismissed the lawsuit as “meritless.” The trustees responsible for returning the money to Madoff’s victims also sued JPMorgan and UBS, but a judge ultimately tossed out the suits. JPMorgan didn’t immediately return an emailed request for comment on Madoff’s email from The Huffington Post Sunday. Madoff has been rather prolific in recent months, penning multiple letters to news organizations from prison. In a January letter to CNBC, Madoff criticized Wall Street signing bonuses, saying they put too much pressure on the employees who receive them to promote special products. In addition, Madoff criticized the ills of modern finance in a letter to CNBC on Christmas Eve. He also emailed CNBC earlier this month, saying he wished he had gone to trial instead of pleading guilty to the fraud. "

Dozens of people marched through central Tokyo to protest dolphin and whale hunts, angering nationalists who blamed the move as discrimination against Japanese tradition. The placard reads 'Save Dolphins.' AFP PHOTO / TOSHIFUMI KITAMURA (Photo credit should read TOSHIFUMI KITAMURA/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1336524000031005532fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Over the past couple months hundreds of conscious and concerned citizens have reached out to me since I began writing some of the gruesome details of the 'War Against Nature.' I was particularly touched by the request of a young lady from Temecula, Calif., who asked me to write about a Taiji dolphin hunter named Izumi Ishii. One morning he woke-up, had an epiphany and renounced his vocation.Ishii realized that dolphins are the creatures that humans would have been had we not left the water. Here's why:Like humans, dolphins are exceptionally tactile creatures and their skin conveys different levels of information or signals to each animal. Excellent sight enables them to see in the dark, while their range of hearing is 10 times that of humans. They keep the kids in line: Adult dolphins discipline their misbehaved juveniles by driving them to the ocean floor and momentarily holding them there.Dolphins are individualists. Each animal has its own signature whistle, which is used to keep in contact with its peers.Dolphins constantly send out noises called 'click trains' which sound, to the untrained ear, like old creaky doors. These complex series of sounds are the most sophisticated, advanced forms of sonar, called echolocation, and are unrivalled by anything on the planet -- man-made or otherwise. As the sonar waves move through water they encounter objects, bouncing back shapes and contents to be deciphered by the dolphin's large brain (which is bigger than a human's). Sometimes the sonar is so potent it actually stuns its prey.Dolphins, it turns out, are a well-rested bunch, sleeping as much as one third of each day. But how do they do this when their predators are always hunting them? The answer is teamwork. Dolphins usually rest in groups that bunch tightly together. One lazy eye per dolphin remains open and, although asleep, their slow methodical echolocatory clicks scan their environment for sharks and other predators. The group essentially forms a sensory integration system of relying on each others' sonar system to detect any trouble while they rest.Izumi Ishii was born into a dolphin hunting family in Futo, Japan. Today he's a self-proclaimed advocate for stopping the dolphin hunt and live trade of dolphins and whales to dolphinariums. Hardy Jones and Ted Danson co-founded the ocean conservation institute Blue Voice and Jones produced an emotive documentary called 'When Dolphins Cry.' It was based upon Ishii's experience recalling how when he slit the throats of dolphins their eyes widened, tears appeared as they screamed to death.For turning over a new leaf, speaking out against the brutality and senseless slaughter of contaminated dolphins -- he's been ostracized by his community and all Japanese fisherman.Today, instead of hunting dolphins he earns his modest and peaceful living by providing a splendid eco-tourist, dolphin-watching service on his boat 'Bright Sea.' Ishii writes and speaks on the atrocities taking place against dolphins still today in Japan even after the Academy-award winning documentary The Cove exposed the Taiji dolphin slaughter.Ishii believes like all animal activists, including myself, that citizen's from around the globe must continue to apply pressure (by emailing the Japan Tourism Agency and telling then that you will not visit Japan because they are destroying dolphins and whales).Japan will respond to pressure exerted from citizens and their respective countries -- and they will be shamed into change or 'Gaiastu' because that's what works in their nation. We are all required to come together and continue in unison to call for a worldwide ban on dolphin and whale hunting, and live trade of these exquisite aquatic mammals. Refuse to purchase tickets to any dolphinariums or parks with captured marine mammals.On Friday February 22 (2013) in Los Angeles hundreds of people protested outside the Consulate-General of Japan: The crowd chanted 'Stop the Whale Hunt in the Great Southern Ocean Sanctuary; Stop the Dolphin Hunt in Taiji and Stop the Trade of Live Dolphins and Whales for Dolphinariums.' My friend, recording artist, actor, producer and tireless animal rights activist Dyan Kane posted her feelings on Facebook: 'The demonstration was powerful and very moving!'All of us in our respective communities and countries are required to stand up for Nature, sign online petitions, send protest emails and organize and attend demonstrations. All critters, like the 100,000 mega-pod of bottlenose dolphins recently spotted off San Diego are entitled to their habitat and the right to life on our blue planet.Lastly, please support the conservation work of Blue Voice, Save Japan Dolphins, Ocean Preservation Society, Animals Australia and Operation Infinite Patience - Sea Shepherd.Earth Dr Reese Halter is a broadcaster, biologist and author of The Insatiable Bark Beetle."

But for one family of four, it's an entire year's budget to live on. Concerned? We were too. But for Danielle Wagasky, the blogger behind Blissful and Domestic, the small budget is a blessing, not a curse. Her family not only is living comfortably off the money (which is her husband Jason's yearly military housing allowance), but they also don't have any debt.First, some background: The family lives in Las Vegas, Nevada in a comfortable ""fixer upper"" home and own two cars. They have two young kids, age six and eight, whom Danielle home schools. But the questions remains: How does she do it?The story starts when her husband was serving his second deployment in Iraq in 2008. Danielle was left to handle the family finances alone for, really, the first time ever. ""I never paid anything growing up -- I was kind of spoiled,"" she said. ""And then, all of a sudden, I had to do all the bills. It was tough."" The sudden responsibility also spurred a stress-shopping habit, particularly at Target. “It was something to do,” she said. “My husband would ask me all the time ‘what are you buying?’”But then everything changed when her husband told her to read ""America's Cheapest Family Gets You Right on the Money: Your Guide to Living Better, Spending Less, and Cashing in on Your Dreams,” a book by Steve and Annette Economides, who feed their family of seven on just $350 a month. It was the first time she had ever heard of once-a-month grocery shopping, which completely changed her outlook on how she buys food for her family, and she gained insight into how much we waste when we don't plan our spending habits. She then started saving literally every nickel and dime her family had and started cutting corners where she could. The goal was that, by the time her husband returned from Iraq, they could put a down payment on a home. Gone were the trips to Target. Instead, Danielle became very acquainted with her local thrift stores and Costco. She also became adamant about picking up new life skills. ""I went to the thrift store, bought a bread maker and a woman from church taught me how to make it,” she said. “It’s so good and it saves a lot of money.”Just two years later, the family was able to pay for their home in cash. Originally the two were going to use the $30,000 she saved as a down payment, but instead bought a home for just that price, hence no mortgage. The purchase, plus the lessened demands from their simplified life, have paid off in dividends. “We don’t fight about what to spend money on,” she said. “We’re definitely the happiest we’ve ever been.”But this idea of living below your means isn’t something Wagansky says is only achievable for a small family living in a rural area. (Though we still think that definitely helps.) She suggests everyone ditch cable, get rid of those credit cards and stop buying lunch at work. “These are things that can be done anywhere,” she said. “Cable is not a necessity.” And if you’re thinking the same thing we are: what about our favorite shows? “We have Netflix and just got Hulu!” she said enthusiastically.Click through our slideshow to see 22 ways to save money on anything, and definitely go check out her blog Blissful and Domestic for everything from recipes to cleaning tips.Have something to say?
