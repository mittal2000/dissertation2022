California grocers, who could realize $1 billion in new revenue from selling paper bags for a dime each, are teaming up with environmentalists on a new push to make California the first state to ban plastic shopping bags. The retail and environmental lobbies, which backed many of 13 failed California bills since 2007 to curb or ban single-use plastic shopping bags, are facing off against manufacturers of both plastic and paper bags who oppose restrictions on the sacks.

But at the state level, opposition from plastic bag makers has usually prevailed.The California Senate voted 22-15 for the bill, which must be signed into law by Sept. 30 by Democratic Governor Jerry Brown, who has not signaled a position on the measure.""Single-use plastic bags not only litter our beaches, but also our mountains, our deserts, and our rivers, streams and lakes,"" said state Senator Alex Padilla, who sponsored the bill.Padilla backed a similar measure last year but it failed by three votes. The fate of this bill was uncertain until the waning hours of the session after falling three votes short in the state's Assembly on Monday.But after picking up the support of the United Food and Commercial Workers Union, the bill passed a second vote in the Assembly.The measure would ban grocery stores from handing out single-use grocery bags with customers' purchases, and provide money to local plastic bag companies to retool to make heavier, multiple-use bags that customers could buy.Environmentalists have pushed for banning plastic bags, which are cheaper for supermarkets to use than paper bags, but create mountains of trash that is difficult to recycle. In California, there is particular concern that the bags, when swept out to sea, could harm ocean life.After the defeat of his earlier bill, Padilla won the support of some California-based bag makers by including the funding for retooling. But in recent months, out-of-state manufacturers campaigned against the bill, even producing television advertisements targeting Padilla, who is running for secretary of state.Cathy Browne, general manager at Crown Poly, a plastic bag manufacturer in Huntington Park, California, said the bill would lead to layoffs at companies like hers.More than 10 billion plastic bags are used in California each year, according to an estimate by Californians Against Waste, an advocacy group supporting the bill.

We must decide whether to stand firm on principle or negotiate and compromise; whether to push for everything we want or work to achieve what we believe is possible. As these choices play out, I am often guided by an important lesson I learned more than four decades ago from one of my heroes in the U.S. civil rights movement, Julian Bond, a young African-American leader of the Student Non-violent Coordinating Committee. The story begins at the 1968 Democratic Convention in Chicago, IL. In the months preceding the Convention, the country had been shaken by a series of traumatic developments. Martin Luther King, Jr. was assassinated in April. Three popular anti-war Senators (Eugene McCarthy, Robert Kennedy, and George McGovern) were running strong campaigns against then-President Lyndon Johnson -- opposing his Vietnam war policy. Their combined successes ultimately forced Johnson to announce that he would withdraw from the contest. And then, in early June, Kennedy was assassinated. When Democrats gathered in Chicago, in August, they were still reeling from the shock of these events. The Convention itself was a tumultuous affair that brought together all of the conflicting currents of the period. Outside of the Convention, there were massive demonstrations against the war in Vietnam coupled with substantial gatherings of ""counter-culture"" activists. At one point, the demonstrations were confronted by a shameful display of police/military force. A battle ensued. There were tanks in the streets, beatings and tear gassing of protesters who chanted ""the whole world is watching"" because, at the time, what was playing out in the streets of Chicago was reminiscent of scenes of repression occurring behind ""the Iron Curtain."" All of these same currents played out inside the Convention, as well. As the proceedings began, there was a battle over which delegation should receive credentials to represent the state of Georgia -- an all white group, or a mixed-race delegation that included Julian Bond. There was some drama, but in the end, the integrated slate won the right to be seated. Then came a platform fight over a plank to oppose the war in Vietnam. It became as heated as the demonstrations on the outside. The anti-war plank was defeated, but in a last ditch effort to continue their protest, party progressives decided to contest the party regulars' hand-picked choice for Vice-President, Senator Ed Muskie. They put Julian Bond's name in nomination as their candidate to run on the ticket with the party's Presidential nominee, Hubert Humphrey. Humphrey, who, as a Senator had a sterling record in civil rights and labor rights, had served as Johnson's Vice-President and was, therefore, viewed with suspicion by anti-war Democrats. The party regulars who supported Muskie were too strong and won the day. Outraged by the way their concerns had been ignored by the party leadership and by the use of brute force against the demonstrators, the anti-war delegates had their say in demonstrations on the floor of the Convention - chanting the name of their candidate ""Julian Bond."" In a crude attempt to regain control of the convention proceedings, the party's leadership brought in police who used unconscionable force to bring order. On the final day of the Convention after Muskie and Humphrey had delivered their acceptance speeches, and stood center-stage, amidst the balloons and confetti and cheers from the party regulars, a remarkable thing occurred. Onto the stage walked Julian Bond. He went over to Humphrey and Muskie and joined hands. Like many young activists, at the time, the scene left me bewildered and devastated. A few years later, I had the opportunity to speak with Julian Bond. He had come to lecture at a college where I was teaching. I asked him why he walked out onto the stage that night and told him how let down I had felt. In response, he told me that there were two types of people. There were those who looked at the evils of this world like war, racism and oppression and said, ""I'm going to stand on my principles because it's got to get a lot worse before it gets any better,"" and then there were those who would say, 'I've got to get to work to see if I can make it at least better.""""I'm with the second group,"" he told me, ""because if I took the first view I would be allowing too many people to continue to suffer while I, maintaining my ideological purity, refused to do anything to help them.""""At that point in the convention it was no longer Julian Bond versus Ed Muskie. It was Hubert Humphrey versus Richard Nixon and I had to make a choice as to who would help make life at least a little bit better.""I never forgot that lesson and am challenged daily to apply it. It is the reason why I have so little patience for ideologues from the right or the left. They wear their purity with great pride. They arrogantly dismiss those with whom they disagree and never see the need to engage differing opinions. Because they see themselves as bearers of the only truth, they are quick to denounce others, as they say, ""with clarity and conviction."" From high on their pinnacle of purity, they often miss the muck of the reality in which most of us live and the tough and often less than perfect choices with which we are confronted in the never-ending challenge we face to make life a little bit better -- whether in the struggle for human rights, improvements in the quality of life, or the provision of security for those who are most vulnerable.

Another militant then beheads him.Islamic State, which declared a ""caliphate"" in June in parts of Iraq and Syria under its control, has been cited as a major security threat by Western governments since posting a video in August of the beheading of U.S journalist James Foley.The Lebanese army declined to comment, but security and Islamic State sources confirmed the latest beheading.Hours later, the group posted a second video showing nine other soldiers begging for their lives, urging their families to take to the streets in the next three days to demand the release of Islamist prisoners as a condition to escape al-Sayyed's fate.Earlier this month, several Syrian groups, including Islamic State and Nusra Front battled the Lebanese army after the arrest of rebel commander Emad Gomaa in the border town of Arsal. Gomaa is a Nusra commander who switched affiliation to Islamic State but remained popular among Nusra fighters.The militants seized Arsal for five days before withdrawing to a mountainous border region, taking the 19 captive soldiers with them.Most of the soldiers were taken by Islamic State militants while Nusra kept a few soldiers and a number of policemen.On Saturday, Nusra released four soldiers and a policeman, all Sunnis, a source close to the group said. The circumstances of their release were not immediately clear.The militants have demanded the release of Gomaa and several Islamists jailed since a 2007 insurrection by an al Qaeda-inspired group at a Palestinian refugee camp in north Lebanon.

The annual Berkshire Hathaway shareholders meeting concluded over the weekend. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e42eb250000350036c862.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"""You'd get very rich if you thought of yourself as having a card with only twenty punches in a lifetime, and every financial decision used up one punch. You'd resist the temptation to dabble. You'd make more good decisions and you'd make more big decisions."" --Warren Buffett , quoted in The Snowball by Alice SchroederThis week Warren Buffett celebrates his 84th birthday.Those of you who follow my blogs know I have a bit of a man crush on Buffett, not just because of his investing acumen but because he has always seemed to me endowed with a kind of uber-common sense -- an ability to cut to the heart of a situation or an issue and capture it in a few words, understandable to experts and common folk alike.Lists of his ""10 greatest"" or ""18 greatest"" (or however many greatest) sayings pop up everywhere in online searches. But the Buffettism that's stayed with me is the one at the top of this blog post -- namely the notion of a punch card (a quaintly antiquated thing you don't run across very often these days).Buffett used his punch-card analogy in an investment context. It's consistent with his belief that really profitable investment decisions are few and far between. His counsel to individual investors has always been to ""wait for the fat pitch."" (See ""Bored Investors Beware."")But I think the punch-card analogy applies equally well to life, and to the decisions that define and shape our lives over the five, six, seven or eight decades most of us are on Earth. For someone graduating from high school, I think the number 20 is just about right. For someone like me, in middle age, the number of unpunched punches on the card is a lot smaller. There might be only two or three left.The point is that, whether it's two or 20, the number of inflection points in our lives is a lot smaller than it often seems. The trick is having the wisdom, or the instinct, to recognize ""fat pitches"" at the time they show up, which is always easier in hindsight. Then we need to make our big decisions count.Getting married. Having children (or not). Making a career change. Starting or investing in a business. Those are obvious hole punches.By contrast, the last two times I punched my card, it had less to do with me, personally, than with the opportunity to make a difference in the lives of others.The first of these was agreeing to chair Wall Street's advocacy group -- the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association -- in the wake of the financial crisis. I did so because I never wanted our clients, the investing public, to again have to go through the trauma and disruption they experienced in their financial and personal lives during that unprecedented and volatile period.My second recent hole punch was deciding to help lead, in 2011 and 2012, a campaign to defeat a constitutional amendment that would have banned same-sex marriage in my home state of Minnesota. I got a lot of advice and counsel against getting involved, as a business leader, in what became known as the ""Vote No"" campaign. But every bone in my body told me this was a once-in-a-lifetime chance to make a difference in the lives of tens of thousands of LGBT residents in a state long known for its progressive brand, inclusive culture and values of respect and tolerance.As it turned out, the support of the business community was critical to not only defeating the amendment but, six months later, legalizing same-sex marriage in Minnesota.That was last year. Just this month two gay friends who had lived together for 34 years before getting married last year at Minneapolis' City Hall thanked me, with tears in their eyes, for being able to celebrate their first-ever wedding anniversary.I wish someone had told me about Buffett's punch-card analogy when I was a lot younger. However, I'm glad I have the opportunity to use it now to recognize and lean into the few remaining ""big decisions"" in my life. I pass it on here as a birthday gift to others -- not from me but from Warren Buffett, who, by the simple arithmetic of his own analogy, has made a big decision once in every four of his 84 years."
8,WORLDPOST,Dismissal of Iranian Science Minister Rallies Both Support and Opposition for Moderate President Rohani,"Angie Ahmadi, ContributorWriter, political analyst",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dismissal-of-iranian-scie_b_5736666.html,The impeachment of Iranian Minister of Science Reza Faraji Dana by the conservative-dominated Iranian Parliament on August 20 has been a key event for both sides -- a slip in the political tectonics that could yield seismic waves throughout the country's political landscape.,2014-08-29,"Iranian Minister for Science, Research and Technology, Reza Faraji Dana, addresses the parliament during his impeachment process in Tehran on August 20, 2014. Iran's conservative-dominated parliament voted to sack the science minister for wanting to recruit people accused of involvement in the 2009 protest movement. AFP PHOTO/BEHROUZ MEHRI (Photo credit should read BEHROUZ MEHRI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13c702400006800381e3e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The impeachment of Iranian Minister of Science Reza Faraji Dana by the conservative-dominated Iranian Parliament on August 20 has been a key event for both sides -- a slip in the political tectonics that could yield seismic waves throughout the country's political landscape. On the one hand, it united conservatives. On the other, it reminded supporters of moderate President Hassan Rohani to heed the obstacles he faces in bringing change, and set the scene for them to rally behind him, despite lingering disenchantment with his hitherto lackluster performance as the chief executive. Whether Rohani can successfully meet the challenges posed by conservative hard-liners will determine his political future, and possibly affect a nuclear deal with the West.Faraji Dana, a reformist with a doctorate in electrical engineering from the University of Waterloo in Canada, was dismissed by parliament for several actions that upset a good majority of conservatives. He revealed his predecessor's abuse of power, reinstated students expelled from universities for political activism, introduced a democratic method for electing university presidents, and granted high-ranking positions to those allegedly affiliated with the opposition. The success of the impeachment prompted sonorous chants of Allah Akbar -- God is great -- that resonated across the legislative chamber as an expression of lawmakers' delight. It provoked protest all over social media, however, where Iranian youth vented their frustration and praised Rohani and Faraji Dana for taking the aforementioned measures to stand up to blatant hypocrisy and injustice. By and large, the impeachment of a pro-reform cabinet member unified Rohani's supporters, including those who had criticized him earlier for failing to deliver on his promises as a candidate. It reminded those who cast their ballots for Rohani that, realistically, change is not easily achieved after eight years of conservative grip on the economy and politics.The MPs behind the impeachment motion came from a broad spectrum of conservative factions. These ranged from supporters of the hardline cleric Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi, who openly opposes democratic institutions as un-Islamic, to center-right forces including Revolutionary Guards veterans and those close to the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who wields the final say over all state policies. The broad base of the vote in parliament against Rohani's Science Minister demonstrates the scale of the threat his government is perceived to pose against the entire spectrum of the conservative bloc. In fact, the risk of potential reemergence of moderate and pro-reform political forces in Iran's power dynamics that Rohani government entails has united conservatives in action, regardless of however divided they may seem from the outside. Rohani, elected president of Iran on the basis of ""prudence and hope,"" assumed the executive office after eight years of repressed political dissent, economic downturn, and increasing international isolation under Ahmadinejad. Rohani's predecessor facilitated the emergence of a new conservative political elite who replaced pragmatic and pro-reform forces within the political establishment. While Ahmadinejad is gone and his comeback to politics is unlikely due to his polarizing personality, this new elite still wields considerable power in the legislature, judiciary, and armed forces, which translates into enough influence over the executive branch to hinder reform.While Rohani has put the lion's share of his efforts into fixing a broken economy and forging a diplomatic detente with the West over the country's nuclear program, his conservative rivals are geared up to escalate pressure on his administration in an effort to tighten their grip on their entrenched economic and political interests. As of yet, the mounting pressure has not evoked a reaction from Supreme Leader Khamenei, who has, however, been looking askance at Rohani's government for the past year. Earlier in July, Khamenei admonished the government for the supposedly liberal atmosphere in higher education and warned that universities should not become a platform for political activism. In a more significant development in August, Khamenei openly expressed concern over bilateral talks with the United States and reminded Rohani's diplomatic team, led by Foreign Minister Javad Zarif, that negotiating with America could harm the regime. In this context, the dismissal of the Minister of Science was unsurprising, and should be seen as the latest in a sequence of blocking maneuvers on the Rohani government.As the rift between Rohani and Khamenei bubbles to the surface, Rohani's conservative rivals grow bolder in chastising him, and the pressure increases on his cabinet. As a pragmatic politician with a penchant for making centrist decisions, Rohani could potentially refrain from pushing for even the slightest of social reforms due to this mounting pressure. This, however, bears a strong resemblance to the events that determined the fate of former reformist president Mohammad Khatami, whose soft stance on his conservative opponents ultimately emasculated his administration and alienated his constituency. One positive sign in the recent events is the appointment of the liberal-minded Mohammad Ali Najafi as the acting science minister, but Rohani's propensity to stand in the center could ultimately lead to a more conservative choice for the permanent successor to the position. For this reason, the next three months could serve as litmus test for Rohani: as he introduces the next minister of science to the parliament for a vote of confidence, a bow to conservative demands could precipitate a weakened administration, jeopardizing public support for his reelection bid as well as Ayatollah Khamenei's support for a nuclear deal with the United States."

Banks agreed to pay sizable sums, but public interest groups have criticized the settlements because the banks suffered few business consequences and their executives escaped criminal and civil charges.""It's very disappointing,"" said Jason Collette, national organizer for Alliance For A Just Society, a network of state-based advocacy groups. ""Until a company loses its federal contracts or a senior executive is punished, these fines are just the cost of doing business.""In May, Navient and its former parent, Sallie Mae, agreed to pay a combined $139 million to resolve Department of Justice allegations that the two companies had swindled up to 60,000 service members out of tens of millions of dollars and forced other borrowers to pay unfair fees on their student loans. At a news conference announcing the settlement, Education Secretary Arne Duncan said he had instructed his staff to immediately conduct a review to determine ""what appropriate actions, if any,"" should be taken against Navient in response to the allegations.Asked then if the Department of Education would cancel Navient's lucrative contract, Duncan said, ""Every option is on the table."" During the ensuing months, the Education Department considered punishing Navient, according to people familiar with the matter, by excluding it for a year from the group of companies allowed to service American college students' federal loans.Instead, Duncan's department is expected to announce as early as Friday that it will require more college students to deal with Navient, rather than the department's numerous other loan servicers, according to people familiar with the matter. As a result, more taxpayer funds will flow to Navient. The company already handles 5.8 million student loan accounts under its contract with the Education Department.On Tuesday, President Barack Obama boasted to veterans at an American Legion convention about how his administration had made it easier for troops to access the same benefits the Justice Department accused Navient of willfully preventing soldiers from enjoying. Dorie Nolt, an Education Department spokeswoman, didn't respond to multiple requests for comment.Companies and government agencies often make public potentially embarrassing news on Friday afternoons, especially before holiday weekends.""If the Education Department is really allocating Navient new loans after its history of unlawful practices, it shows that the department isn't prioritizing the safety of borrowers. Instead, they're prioritizing their contractors,"" said Chris Hicks, an organizer who leads the Debt-Free Future campaign for Jobs With Justice, a Washington-based nonprofit that has called on Duncan to suspend the department’s contract with Navient.The announcement is among several planned by the Education Department regarding its troubled student loan servicing system. The agency announced Friday that it will change the way it evaluates the companies it pays to collect borrowers' monthly student loan payments -- placing more emphasis on how borrowers rank the companies -- and that it will significantly increase the share of student loans assigned to smaller, not-for-profit loan specialists. The department had previously hoped to reduce the role of not-for-profit loan servicers, but their recent performance surprised department officials. As a result, the companies will be rewarded with new business. Some federal officials hope that as a result, the department will be less reliant on large companies such as Navient.The department also announced that it will change the way it pays its loan specialists, a move Obama suggested in June, in hopes that the change will lead servicers to enroll more borrowers in repayment plans that cap monthly payments relative to borrowers' incomes.The Education Department awards new loans to its servicers based on a system that grades their ability to prevent borrower defaults and measures customer satisfaction. Increasing the importance of borrower survey scores could hurt Navient, as borrowers have consistently ranked the company as being among the department's worst.Over the last two years, Navient -- as part of Sallie Mae -- has finished in last place among the department's four major loan specialists. The company is expected to finish in third this year, according to analysts at Compass Point Research & Trading, a Washington-based financial firm.In May, the Justice Department and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., a federal bank regulator, accused Navient of intentionally overcharging troops on their federal student loans and willfully obtaining default judgments against service members over an eight-year period, in violation of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act. The FDIC alleged the companies illegally told troops they had to be deployed to receive entitled benefits and improperly required them to meet other tests.Neither Navient nor Sallie Mae admitted or denied wrongdoing as part of their settlement agreement with federal authorities. The company told investors it was being punished for not complying with what it described as new standards. Navient’s chief executive, John Remondi, apologized in a statement for “processing errors.” Navient spun off from Sallie Mae on May 1, taking the company’s loan servicing and collections business. Sallie Mae is now a bank.By the Education Department's reckoning, Navient has improved its performance in the wake of the settlement. Data released for the first time this month suggest Navient has improved the way it treats borrowers with federal student loans.

Rick Perry speaks to the National Right to Life convention at the Hyatt Regency DFW International Airport Hotel June 27, 2013 in Grapevine, Texas. Perry has reportedly vowed to continue the fight for a more restrictive abortion law in Texas after the state legislature failed to get the law passed during a special session because of a filibuster and protests.

On Monday, if a major provision of a new anti-abortion law went into effect, the state would have been left with only seven clinics -- all concentrated in urban areas of the sprawling state.But on Friday, U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel blocked the controversial measure in a lawsuit brought by the Center for Reproductive Rights on behalf of several abortion providers. The state will appeal the ruling.The law signed by Gov. Rick Perry (R) in 2013 requires all abortions to take place in ambulatory surgical centers (ASCs), or mini-hospitals. Most of the 19 abortion clinics that remain in the state cannot afford to undergo the extensive renovations and pay the monthly operating costs to become an ASC, so they would have to close.The new law, HB2, also bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, requires abortion providers to obtain admitting privileges at a local hospital, and limits how doctors can administer non-surgical medication abortions. The Center for Reproductive Rights filed its lawsuit earlier this year against the admitting privileges provision of the law and the provision requiring clinics to become ASCs. The group claims that the law is not designed to protect women's health, but to eliminate access to safe and legal abortions across the state.""The court has made clear that women’s well-being is not advanced by laws attacking access to essential health care, and that rights protected by the U.S. Constitution may not be denied through laws that make them impossible to exercise,” said Nancy Northup, CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, in a statement after the judge ruled.""Texas women still face serious threats to their rights, health, and ability to obtain safe, high-quality reproductive health care from reputable doctors in their communities,"" Northup added. ""But at least for the moment, today’s victory is vital in preventing politicians’ scorched-earth assaults on women’s health care from causing even more harm than they already have.""Republican lawmakers have claimed that the new law is necessary for women's safety. But two of the state's expert witnesses, Drs. Mayra Jimenez Thompson and James Anderson, admitted to having been coached by Vincent Rue, an anti-abortion marriage therapist who has been discredited as a witness in previous abortion cases. According to Mother Jones, Rue has claimed that abortion ""reescalates the battle between the sexes"" and ""increases bitterness toward men."" If the judge had allowed HB2 to go into effect, large swaths of the state would be without an abortion provider. The Huffington Post reported earlier this year that ""back-alley"" abortions are already making a comeback in the state, particularly in the Southwest part of Texas near the Mexico border. Because women in the Rio Grande Valley already have to drive roughly 250 miles to the nearest abortion clinic in San Antonio, some have opted to buy abortion-inducing pills on the black market and administer them themselves.Women's health advocates worry that a lack of access will drive women to illegal, unsafe clinics or bring back the days of women using sharp objects to end their pregnancies as they did before abortion became legal in 1973.""Women will resort to other means to try to terminate a pregnancy, which will put their lives at risk,"" Hal Lawrence, CEO of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, told reporters this week. This story has been updated to reflect Judge Yeakel's ruling."

One of the most outspoken voices of the theocratic right is Bryan Fischer of the American Family Association. He recently wrote: ""Perhaps the most sinister and dangerous lie the left has beaten into the brains of unthinking Americans is that there is strength in diversity. Nothing could be further from the truth.""He claims ""strength is found in unity and not diversity"" and that countries should be like football teams: ""Successful football teams wear identical uniforms, take directions from one coach, follow one game plan, and serve one high school, college or franchise. It is utter bilge and dangerous falsehood to believe that there is some kind of mystical strength in diversity.""Serve one purpose, follow one plan, take orders from one coach, and wear matching uniforms! Has anyone seriously proposed such an idea since Mussolini was strung from a lamppost? Libertarianism has many strands but none supportive of this nonsense. Two figures of influence -- one popular, the other academic -- were Ayn Rand and Friedrich Hayek.In the 1940s, Rand, then a scriptwriter in Hollywood, suggested that film scripts should never preach conformity. Don't preach that everybody should be and act alike.Would Fischer go that far? Yes. He argues ""Racial diversity is a strength only if it is subsumed under an overarching unity of values and purpose."" He said that American unity is based on Christianity and the Ten Commandments and anyone is welcome to come to America ""IF they embrace these fundamental values..."" Must one embrace Christianity to be allowed into America? Did Mr. Fischer really mean to imply ""Jews Need Not Apply""? Of course, the idea that preaching conformity teaches hatred toward those not like oneself is proven by Fischer. His vitriolic hatred toward the LGBT community is notorious. I would go so far as to say his fundamentalist Christianity is inherently hateful. Any study of history shows fundamentalists were in the forefront of the Nativists and Know-Nothings who despised Irish, Chinese, Jews and Catholics. American fundamentalism was intimately linked to the Klan. It tended to support slavery, Jim Crow laws, and oppose the civil rights movement.Fundamentalism has been, and is, the prime example of Rand's warning: Those who preach conformity teach their followers to hate anyone who is different from them.Fischer's collectivism demands subordination of the individual to the collective. He wants ""unity of purpose""; ""energy that could be harnessed through unity of purpose and values is frittered away."" What does he mean by ""energy that could be harnessed""? He isn't talking about solar power; he's talking about human energy. He wants individuals ""harnessed through unity of purpose"" instead of being allowed freedom to fritter their lives away on individualistic endeavors. It is precisely this kind of conformism Hayek warned about:Where there is one common all-overriding end there is no room for any general morals or rules. ...[W]here a few specific ends dominate the whole of society, it is inevitable that occasionally cruelty may become a duty, that acts which revolt all our feelings, such as the shooting of hostages or the killing of the old or sick, should be treated as mere matters of expediency.... There is always in the eyes of the collectivist a greater goal which these acts serve and which to him justifies them because the pursuit of the common end of society can know no limits in any rights or values of any individual.Hayek's libertarianism is in the liberal tradition -- I argue all libertarianism is a variant of liberalism and the idea of the conservative ""ally"" is a delusion. Hayek said the main difference between his views and those of the conservative is ""that moral beliefs concerning matters of conduct which do not directly interfere with the protected sphere of other persons do not justify coercion."" In his The Constitution of Liberty (1960) he said, ""The most conspicuous instance of this in our society is that of the treatment of homosexuality.""In the almost six decades since Hayek wrote that, things have not changed a lot. The intolerant conservative is still obsessed with ""the treatment of homosexuality"" as Mr. Fischer exhibits on an almost daily basis. It seems Fischer is more obsessed with homosexuality than are homosexuals.Hayek's Why I Am Not a Conservative perfectly dissects the collectivism and authoritarianism of theocrats such as Fischer, though written when Fischer was a child. Hayek said the conservative only ""feels safe and content"" when ""some higher wisdom watches and supervises change"" and yearns for some ""authority"" to keep things under control. They are not opposed ""to coercion or arbitrary power so long as it is used for what he regards as the right purposes. ""He regards himself as entitled to force the value he holds on other people.""The true liberal, wrote Hayek, ""will never regard himself as entitled to impose [his own spiritual beliefs] on others and that for him the spiritual and the temporal are different spheres which ought not to be confused.""The classical liberal, or libertarian, tradition is not some variant of conservatism. It is its polar opposite. Classical liberalism opposed the mindset of the Bryan Fischers of its day. The sooner modern libertarians realize conservatives are not their friends, the sooner they can get around to actually promoting the extension of individual rights for all people -- including people conservatives hate."

Critics of fracking in California cite concerns over water usage and possible chemical pollution of ground water sources as California farmers are forced to leave unprecedented expanses of fields fallow in one of the worst droughts in California history. Concerns also include the possibility of earthquakes triggered by the fracking process which injects water, sand and various chemicals under high pressure into the ground to break the rock to release oil and gas for extraction though a well. The 800-mile-long San Andreas Fault runs north and south on the western side of the Monterey Formation in the Central Valley and is thought to be the most dangerous fault in the nation.

Oil drilling produced more than 130 billion gallons of water last year.""The public has the right to know about the oil industry's use of limited fresh water supplies,"" said Senator Fran Pavley, the bill's author.Environmentalists applauded the bill's passage, saying it is key to understanding who is contributing to the depletion of aquifers during the drought.""We think that the oil and gas industry is using far more water than they will admit, and applaud the California legislature, in particular the author of the bill, Senator Pavley, for recognizing the need for transparency,"" said Miriam Gordon, California director of Clean Water Action.Oil industry officials objected to an earlier version of the bill, which would have required oil producers to only use recycled water during times of drought, a move they said would be tantamount to a moratorium on oil production in the state.Those objections were dropped when the bill was revised as a reporting-only bill, and the industry's primary lobbying group, the Western States Petroleum Institute, said it was neutral on the final bill.Last year, Pavley authored a bill requiring the oil industry to report the amount of water used during hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a well stimulation technique where water and chemicals are injected deep underground to break up rock and free oil and gas deposits.The bill passed on Thursday adds enhanced oil recovery and non-fracking operations to the mandatory reporting framework laid out in that bill.The bill now heads to Governor Jerry Brown's desk, where he is expected to sign it into law.

(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d44b210000d601c964bf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Ferguson tragedy, like all those that preceded it and all that will follow -- involving the trivial and panicky use of lethal force, by the police or anyone else -- stirs up questions the social status quo doesn't dare face.My sister, Sue Melcher, put it this way: ""I find myself also nauseated that another issue never seems to enter the discussion: the issue that a highly trained officer could make such a mistake with a gun demonstrates that just having the weapon present increased the danger of the situation. Had the citizens been armed, how many more casualties could there have been? None of us is 'healthy' enough to be trusted to use lethal force wisely -- and is that even possible?""The ""wise"" use of lethal force... We've wrapped our global civilization around the certainty that we understand and revere life in all its vastness and mystery so completely that we know when to cut it short, indeed, that we -- those of us who are officially sanctioned good guys -- have a right to cut it short in, it would seem, an ever-widening array of circumstances. In so doing, we allegedly make life better for the social whole. This is called militarism. To keep this profitable lie going, we refuse to look deeply at its consequences.When we inflict death on distant cultures, at the sterile remove that modern weapons grant us, we can avoid all but the most cursory awareness of the consequences of our actions. But when we do it at home, it's not always so easy. Ferguson, Ferguson. A community -- and a nation -- erupted in agony at the hellish absurdity of Michael Brown's killing. One of the deeper, darker questions concealed in the maelstrom of rage and grief of Ferguson is this one: What if Officer Darren Wilson had not been armed when he told the two teenagers to get out of the street? What if the police force that employed him knew of, and practiced, effective, nonlethal forms of keeping order in the community (and did not regard the people it was ""protecting"" as the enemy)? This is not a simple question, but it has a simple answer. Michael Brown would be alive and Darren Wilson would not be in hiding. But no one is asking it because the popular imagination doesn't even entertain the possibility that such methods exist -- or can be created.I ask this question now not to toss a superficial answer or two at the national and global violence epidemic we're caught in but to establish, first of all, the idea that violence has consequences and, furthermore, that having lethal force at one's fingertips also has consequences. ""None of us is 'healthy' enough to be trusted to use lethal force wisely,"" Sue wrote. This is true if only because such power can always be wrested away from us, and knowing this is bound to bring an intensified level of panic into someone's decision-making process -- even a trained professional's.The demand for police accountability that the Ferguson tragedy has unleashed is a demand for public scrutiny of an officer's state of mind when he makes the decision to use lethal force. At present, such accountability is murky, contained as it is within the police and legal community. Most likely, these communities will protect their own and cut officers slack for acting out of panic. Consider what Michael Bell learned during his campaign for police accountability. Bell, a retired lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Air Force whose 21-year-old son was killed by a police officer in Kenosha, Wis., in 2004, eventually won a wrongful death lawsuit in the incident and used the $1.75 million settlement to pursue a campaign for stricter police accountability in Wisconsin. Writing recently in Politico, Bell noted the results of the campaign's research: ""In 129 years since police and fire commissions were created in the state of Wisconsin, we could not find a single ruling by a police department, an inquest or a police commission that a shooting was unjustified.""What concerns me about this isn't so much the protection of police officers who use lethal force unnecessarily as the protection of lethal force itself. This is what gets off scot-free time and again, in shooting after shooting, and therefore remains unquestioned as a necessary part of social order. If the consequences of lethal force were subjected to objective scrutiny, I believe we'd be looking for alternatives with far more seriousness.Bell's son, for instance, was killed in the course of a routine traffic stop. According to the police report, one officer screamed that his gun had been grabbed and a second officer shot the young man in the head, ""sticking the gun so close against his temple that he left a muzzle imprint.""Because the Bell family hired a private investigator, they learned details of their son's killing independently of the legal system, e.g., ""that the officer who thought his gun was being grabbed in fact had caught it on a broken car mirror,"" Bell wrote. In other words, a minor misperception escalated instantly into a fatal shooting, ending a young man's life and inflicting a lifetime of grief on those who loved him. Not only that, it shattered the life of at least one of the officers involved. The officer who screamed that his gun had been grabbed committed suicide six years later.Violence explodes in every direction. According to the Badge of Life website, U.S. police officers commit suicide at a rate of 17 per 100,000 officers, well above the rate of the general public and close to that of the U.S. military. It's also well above the rate of officers who are killed in the line of duty.""Particularly startling in the study was the finding that not a single suicide in 2008 (or 2009) was ever attributed to police work,"" the site notes. ""While police departments announce that law enforcement is a 'highly stressful, traumatic job,' they prefer to place the blame for a suicide on the family or on the officer for having some kind of 'personal problem.'""Lethal force gets off scot-free. As militarization of the police escalates and our brutal wars for profit come home to haunt us, the time has come to face the violence we bring on one another in the name of social order. The time has come to find the courage to disarm.- - - Robert Koehler is an award-winning, Chicago-based journalist and nationally syndicated writer.
