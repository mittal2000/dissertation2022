Obama is pressing federal agencies to expedite the section of the Keystone XL pipeline between Oklahoma and the Gulf Coast (Photo by Tom Pennington/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1395f1f0000250123371a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Timothy GardnerWASHINGTON, May 10 (Reuters) - The Obama administration is unlikely to make a decision on the Canada-to-Nebraska Keystone XL pipeline until late this year as it painstakingly weighs the project's impact on the environment and on energy security, a U.S. official and analysts said on Friday.The decision may not be made until November, December or even early 2014, said a U.S. official, as President Barack Obama will not rush the process, which still has a number of stages to work through. One of those stages has not even begun yet and will run for months.""The president has to be able to show that the administration looked under every stone to ensure it knew as much as it possibly could about the impact of Keystone,"" said the official, who did not want to be named given the sensitive nature of the project.Analysts agreed that a decision would not be made by this summer as the State Department had suggested when it issued an environmental review on the pipeline on March 1.The State Department is nominally in charge of making a final decision on TransCanada Corp's proposed project, which would help link Alberta's oil sands with refineries and ports along the U.S. Gulf Coast, because the pipeline would cross the national border. But Obama is expected to weigh heavily on the decision.Another delay in the project, which has been pending for more than four years, would likely anger Canada, whose Prime Minister Stephen Harper is visiting New York next week to push the project at the Council on Foreign Relations.Other Canadian federal and provincial officials have visited Washington regularly to press the case for the pipeline.It could also set back TransCanada which last month said delays by Washington would delay completion of the project to the second half of 2015 and push costs for the project above its estimate of $5.3 billion.A State Department spokeswoman on Thursday said the environmental review has received more than 1 million public comments.The State Department did not immediately respond to questions about when it plans to finalize its assessment or move to the next stage of determining, with input from several other agencies, whether the pipeline is in the national interest. That stage is expected to take 90 days. Federal agencies will also have 15 days to comment on the decision before it is finalized.A White House spokesman said in an email that he could not offer any guidance on when a decision is expected.Kevin Book, a policy analyst at ClearView Energy Partners, said August looks less likely for a decision, but September or October still seem reasonable. Obama may want to time an approval of the pipeline to coincide with new Environmental Protection Agency climate rules for coal plants as a way of appeasing environmentalists who oppose Keystone XL, he said.Getting the timing right could be a challenge as Republicans in the Senate stall the confirmation of Gina McCarthy, Obama's pick to lead the EPA. BIG REVISIONS NEEDED?Backers of the pipeline say the project would boost North American energy security and provide thousands of construction jobs. Opponents argue that it would lead to higher releases of greenhouse gases.Even before that the national interest decision process kicks off, revisions to the environmental assessment may be needed after the EPA last month took issue with several parts of the State Department's review.The EPA had concerns about the level of emissions from Canada's oil sands, where crude production is carbon-intensive. It also took issue with the State Department's conclusion that the pipeline would have no effect on climate because the oil sands would make it to market whether or not the pipeline was approved. The State Department said much of the oil could be moved by rail, an assumption the EPA questioned.If the EPA and State Department do not come to an agreement, the decision could be sent to the White House, which could take even more time. A more likely scenario is that the two agencies will work out a solution, but they will most likely take their time to examine every detail to shield the decision from lawsuits.""If they short-circuit the process it will open up whatever decision they make to legal challenge,"" said Daniel Weiss, a fellow at the Center for American Progress Action Fund.Bills are pending in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate that would give Congress, not the administration, the power to approve the pipeline. Passage in the House seems likely, but prospects in the Democrat-led Senate are uncertain, and the bill would probably meet a presidential veto. (Editing by Carol Bishopric)"

Today, and every day, we are grateful for -- and indebted to -- the billions of mothers and other women who serve as the glue that keeps our families and communities together. Unfortunately, in the fight against AIDS, women continue to bear a disproportionate burden. In many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, HIV remains the leading cause of death and disease for women of reproductive age, and in the region, 60 percent of those living with HIV are women. Despite these sobering statistics, countless women continue to prosper in the face of seemingly insurmountable odds.Whether a woman is a mother today, or a mother to be, her health is paramount -- both for her own productivity and quality of life, and that of the next generation. One way that we can help to support women -- and their children -- is by ensuring that all mothers receive the essential health services they need, including for HIV. Moreover, by saving mothers' lives and allowing babies to be born without HIV, we are lessening future health care costs, stabilizing families and communities, and positively impacting economies and nations. As of September 30, 2012, The United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) directly supported more than 5.1 million people on ART--61 percent of whom are women. In 2012 alone, PEPFAR reached more than 750,000 pregnant women living with HIV with antiretroviral drugs, enabling an estimated 230,000 babies who would have otherwise been infected, to be born without HIV. This is a remarkable achievement, and the pace of progress continues to accelerate. Through PEPFAR's prevention of mother-to-children transmission (PMTCT) of HIV Acceleration initiative, launched in 2010, we increased investments in the 13 highest burden countries, while working with countries to develop strategies to expand access to quality PMTCT services. These efforts are paying off dramatically. In fact, between 2009 and 2011, we saw a 24 percent decline in the number of new pediatric infections globally, compared to a 23 percent decline in the previous six years. Since June 2011, PEPFAR has proudly joined with UNAIDS, partner countries, and other key stakeholders to implement the Global Plan towards the Elimination of New HIV Infections among Children by 2015 and Keeping their Mothers Alive. By focusing attention and effort on the 22 countries (21 in sub-Saharan Africa) that account for 90 percent of all new infant HIV infections, the Global Plan has served as a clarion call for uniting diverse partners around this critical and achievable mission.One new and potentially revolutionary tool that has greatly simplified the approach to PMTCT is Option B+. Option B+ offers all pregnant or breastfeeding women living with HIV lifelong ART, rather than relying on laboratory testing to determine eligibility for treatment. Remarkably, not only can Option B+ reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV to less than five percent, but it also maintains the mother's health, provides lifelong reduction of HIV transmission to uninfected sexual partners, and supports PMTCT in future pregnancies. Few other public health interventions offer such clear and widespread benefits.Encouragingly, Option B+ is rapidly gaining momentum around the globe, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. Malawi -- where Option B+ was developed -- is a prime example. After one year of implementation of Option B+, the number of pregnant or breastfeeding women living with HIV on ART in the country increased by an extraordinary 700 percent, and the estimated number of infant infections averted nearly quadrupled.In addition to being highly effective, Option B+ is also simpler. In Malawi, rollout of this approach enabled pregnant women to receive prenatal care and ART, if they tested positive for HIV, in the same clinic. Option B+ also reduced ART to a single daily pill that could be prescribed by doctors or nurses, lessening the burden for the provider and the patient.Other countries are quickly moving to follow suit. Uganda, Rwanda, and Haiti have already begun actively implementing Option B+ or are pursuing a phased rollout of the approach. And 15 more countries in sub-Saharan African have officially endorsed, or are preparing to pilot or rollout, Option B+. As outlined in the PEPFAR Blueprint for Creating an AIDS-free Generation, PEPFAR remains fully committed to working toward the elimination of new HIV infections among children by 2015 and keeping their mothers alive. To reach this goal, we are closely collaborating with partner countries, the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and many others. Everyone has a role to play, and we all must step up our efforts. By improving our ability to expand access to lifesaving HIV treatment for mothers and preventing transmission to their infants, Option B+ will be a game-changer in our collective push to achieve an AIDS-free generation. One future Mother's Day, let's hope that we can all celebrate such an achievement."

5,TRAVEL,Beyond the Running of the Bulls: Spain's 10 Wildest Festivals,"minube, Contributor

In recent years, other fiestas like Valencia's tomato-throwing bash, La Tomatina, have made the international tourist radar and now draw visitors from around the world.However, when it comes to the off-the-wall celebrations found in Spain, these are just the tip of the iceberg. We've sifted through recommendations from thousands of locals and travelers on minube and found this selection of Spain's wildest festivals you can't miss in 2013.1.) El Cascamorras - According to legend, the Cascamorras festival originated from a feud between two Andalusian towns, Baza and Guadix, over a revered statue of the Virgin Mary. Baza, the statue's home, said that if anyone from Guadix could make it to the church without being stained by the locals, they could have the statue. This somber challenge has since transformed into a yearly celebration with thousands of revelers smeared in black grease-paint clamoring to splatter fellow partygoers and the invading ""cascamorras"" (buffoon) who comes to take the statue. (Photo by Viveydeja)2.) Bous a la Mar -- The Bous a la Mar (literally ""Bulls to the Sea"") festival is held in the second week of July in the small Mediterranean resort town of Denia. The festivities, part of the local patron saint celebrations, involve running bulls from the town square to an impromptu bullring on the coast, where groups of audacious locals try to coax the charging beast into jumping into the sea. (Photo by CostaBlanca)3.) Nit de Foc -- Every June 24th, the sleepy Mallorcan village of Mancor de la Vall is the backdrop for one of Spain's most ghoulishly fun celebrations. During the day, the festival is a pleasant affair featuring local costumes, handicrafts, and traditional food. But when the sun sets, fire-wielding folk demons take to the streets for the Nit de Foc (""Night of Fire""), while crowds of revelers gather to watch the spectacle, sample local wine, and dance to traditional bagpipe and drum music. (Photo by Francisco B. Reina)4.) Toro de Fuego - While few traditions are as ingrained in Spanish culture as bull running, the Toro de Fuego (""Fire Bull"") is a popular and unusual twist on a fiesta favorite. The Toro de Fuego is a small, cast-iron bull which is loaded down with industrial-strength sparklers and hoisted on the shoulders of a local volunteer who proceeds to chase participants through the streets in haze of smoke, fire, and shouts of rowdy delight. (Photo by Yoli Chamba)5.) Es FirÃ³ - One of Mallorca's most emblematic festivals is Es FirÃ³, a celebration of the region's defense against Moorish invaders in 1561. Held on the second Monday in May, Es FirÃ³ draws thousands of costumed revelers who re-enact the unsuccessful Moorish siege of the island, and top the event off with plenty of wine, songs, and fireworks. (Photo by Pere J. Oliver)6.) Fiesta de la MercÃ© - No festival is dearer to the citizens of Barcelona than September's Fiesta de la MercÃ¨. This city-wide carnival boasts tons of concerts, children's activities, exhibits, beach parties, and the famous Festa de Foc (""Fire Party""), where massive dragons are paraded through the streets to the beat of drums, all bathed in the glow of over 2 tons of fireworks. (Photo by Fernand Maulion)7.) Mare de Deu Festival -- From the 7-8th of September, the town of AlgemesÃ­, Valencia is host to the Mare de Deu Festival, one of the oldest (dating back to 1247) and most renowned in the region. Declared Intangible Cultural Heritage by UNESCO, the party involves plenty of processions, drinking, and dancing, but the most spectacular part is the Muxieranga, festively-dressed teams of daredevils who built multi-story human towers along the parade route. (Photo by Toni CalderÃ³n)8.) Festival of Moralzarzal -- While Pamplona's Running of the Bulls is a favorite among visitors, many locals now opt for a smaller, less-touristy festival in the town of Moralzalzar near Madrid. No grand histories or sacred traditions here; just an authentic, raucous good time of music, food, wine, and, of course, bulls. (Photo by David R. AzaÃ±a)9.) A Rapa das Bestas -- One of Spain's oddest festivals takes place in the small Galician village of Sabuceda during the first week of June. During A Rapa das Bestas, hundreds of wild mustangs are rounded up from the surrounding hills and driven into an arena in the town where their manes are trimmed and they're given medicines. The thrill of this party comes from the daring wranglers who dive into the churning mass of wild mustangs to carry out their duties. (Photo by Victor GÃ³mez)10.) Battle of Claret -- To finish off this list, we've included a festival that embodies one of Spain's most widely-practiced summer festivities: gathering together with your friends and family on a sunny day and relentlessly sloshing each other with local wine. The Battle of Claret, held the last Sunday in July in the small village of San Asensio, La Rioja is one of the country's most popular wine battles and draws visitors from all over the country.

But that doesn't necessarily apply to the timeshare industry.After you hear Mike Seldin's story, you might be forgiven for thinking that industry's best customers are ignorant ones. And you might wonder which other businesses prefer to keep their customers in the dark.Seldin and his wife attended a timeshare presentation in Las Vegas recently and purchased a trial membership that failed to deliver on its promises. But don't worry, this story has a dramatic but happy ending.The couple was hooked with the promise of free show tickets, which is the preferred bait of Vegas timeshare peddlers. Their two-hour, high-pressure presentation emphasized a VIP program, which the Seldins would have access to for their first two years of membership.""One of the perks of the VIP program was that we would get limo transportation to and from the airport whenever we vacationed and also have use of the limo for short trips,"" he remembers.Too good to be trueLike most timeshare pitches, their saleswoman was persistent, hammering the Seldins with the benefits of buying now. They both liked the perks, but like any informed consumer, wanted to take a little time to think it over. That didn't sit well with their saleswoman, who insisted on closing the deal then and there.""She offered us a trial membership at the VIP level for two years for $2,700, which would then be applied to the same purchase price we were offered if we decided to buy,"" remembers Seldin. ""My wife has always been skeptical of time shares but this even sounded good to her. She kicked me under the table to indicate we should go for it. So we signed for the trial and were even given a limo ride back to the hotel.""The Seldins bought a trial membership in a timeshare without reading the terms of their purchase, because their saleswoman really wanted them to sign now. Hmmm.You probably can see where this is headed, can't you?You're not an ownerAlmost a week later, the Seldins decided to try their trial membership. Under Nevada's convoluted timeshare regulations, they had five days to cancel their contract, but their agreement allowed them seven days. So they logged on to the member website.""The first red flag was the message, 'You are not authorized to use this website at your membership level. Please call our travel representative for more information,'"" he remembers.Then things went from bad to worse.""I then found out there were actually two VIP programs,"" he says. ""One for owners and one for trial members. I asked what the benefits of the trial member VIP program were. Essentially, the only benefit was that we would have a dedicated travel representative by phone to assist us with our travel plans so we wouldn't have to go through different people each time we called.""In other words, the persistent timeshare saleswoman told them a little white lie. While the VIP benefits existed, she wasn't selling a trial membership in that program.Oops.Seldin phoned the saleswoman and asked her about the inconsistency.""She seemed to be unaware of the two different VIP programs and was pretty sure it was a mistake,"" he says. ""She said she would look into it but, since this was Saturday and corporate was closed, she may not have an answer until Monday.""Ah, but wait! Remember the cancellation period? If Seldin waited until Monday, he'd lose his $2,700. And he was starting to get a bad feeling about the whole operation.""I then asked about the perks we were promised as VIP members, including the limo service. She said she could only speak for her property but that we would still be entitled to that in Las Vegas. No guarantees for other properties,"" he says.That did it.""At that point, I was really beginning to feel we'd been taken,"" he says. ""I indicated that I would like to cancel the contract and she said she had no authority to cancel, only to sell, and she didn't know the procedure for cancellation. She then said I should reconsider because 'it's still a great deal.' Aside from the lies and misinformation, of course.""Only at the 11th hour did the Seldins turn to their contract and read it from top to bottom. The agreement specified that they had until the seventh day to cancel, but that it had to be postmarked by midnight on the seventh day.""Luckily, we have a post office by the airport with late night hours,"" says Seldin. ""We made it.""They received a full refund. But other customers, they are certain, are not so lucky. I know they're right because I hear from timeshare victims almost every day.While the sales presentation that led to the Seldins' questionable purchase may have violated the ethics code of the American Resort Development Association, the timeshare industry's trade group, they would have had little recourse as a practical matter. Because even though their saleswoman danced around a few facts, their contract spelled it all out.When it came to the Seldins' timeshare, ignorance was not bliss -- a hard but valuable lesson learned.And it raises a bigger question: Which industries truly benefit from informed consumers? Are there any in the travel industry that actively try to educate their customers? (I can't think of any, but maybe you can.) How about outside travel?Does any company profit from having knowledgeable customers, or do they do better when we act dumb?By the way, after you've left a comment here, let's continue the discussion on my consumer advocacy site or on Twitter, Facebook and Google.

Lymphoma is a cancer of the lymphatic system.The decision to stop the drug's development will result in a second-quarter charge of about $30 million, but the company's 2013 forecast remained unchanged, Lilly said in a statement on Friday.Lilly over the past decade has also tested the pill against a variety of other types of tumors, without success, including lung cancer and breast cancer. Its main remaining focus has been on lymphoma.Cowen and Co had expected Lilly to seek marketing approval for the medicine this year as a lymphoma treatment, and for it to generate annual sales by 2016 of about $200 million, if approved for the condition. That would have made it a fairly modest product for Lilly.Approval would have given a boost to Lilly's cancer program. The company's third-biggest medicine is Alimta, a treatment for lung cancer that pulls in $2.5 billion a year, but it could face generic competition in the United States by 2016.Lilly on Friday said it continues with late-stage trials of two other experimental cancer drugs.Lilly shares were little changed in morning trading."

Not only is it one of France's most popular tourist destinations, but according to data from the World Bank, France is the world's most-visited country.The World Bank compiled data for nearly every country in the world, primarily counting a ""tourist"" as anyone traveling to a country other than the country of their primary residence and whose main purpose in visiting was not work-related. Given the lack of standardized counting methods at every country in the survey, there are slight discrepancies from country to country. Notes the survey's introduction: In some cases data are from border statistics (police, immigration, and the like) and supplemented by border surveys. In other cases data are from tourism accommodation establishments. For some countries number of arrivals is limited to arrivals by air and for others to arrivals staying in hotels. Outside of France, which took the number 1 spot with nearly 81.5 million visitors in 2011, the United States came in second with 62.7 million visitors. In third, China, with approximately 57.6 million tourists. (See the entire top 10 in our slideshow, below.) The most recent complete set of data is actually from 2011. A World Bank representative explained in an email to The Huffington Post that 2012 data will not be available until next year.And while The World Bank did not immediately respond to our inquiries as to why it's over a year old, presumably it takes some time to gather data from the world's more isolated regions (we're looking at you, Tuvalu). Information provided by the UN's World Tourism Organization is similarly dated, also relying on statistics from 2011.PHOTOS of the top 10 most-visited countries in the world [per World Bank]:"

However, we're far from the only ones who love these spots, and sometimes we need a break from the crowds.We're sharing our favorite less-explored summer spots to find shade, a cool drink or simply some extra space - just don't tell too many people:--Roosevelt Island: To get to this narrow, serene island in the East River, you can take the F train. But we recommend hopping on the tramway for aerial views with just a swipe of your MTA card. Grab some ice cream at Coach Scot's Main Street Sweets and stroll the boardwalk to FDR Four Freedoms Park, passing the abandoned remains of the Renwick Smallpox Hospital along the way. Find a seat along the low stone walls and take in the panoramic backdrop of the Manhattan skyline.--Tudor City Greens: Near First Avenue and 41st Street, this small but well-maintained park offers a calming respite in the center of the Midtown hustle. Plenty of shade and benches make it a favorite spot for lunch breaks from the office, especially among staffers at the nearby United Nations building.  --Battery Gardens beer garden: Though Battery Gardens is best known as a restaurant and reception venue, it also hosts an outdoor beer garden in the summer. With ample seating and affordable pitchers, it's popular with the after-work crowd.--The Cloisters: For a relaxing afternoon, take the A train to The Cloisters Museum and Gardens in Washington Heights. A branch of the Metropolitan Museum, it showcases 2,000 works of medieval European art. Roam the gardens and then cool off at the indoor exhibits -- the Unicorn Tapestries are a must see. Admission is $25 for adults and free for children under 12.--Snug Harbor Cultural Center: On the north shore of Staten Island, this estate was once a home for retired sailors. Now the cultural center's 83 acres provide a full day of entertainment, with Greek Revival buildings, a botanical garden, a park, a contemporary art museum, a children's museum, and multiple performance venues hosting theater, concerts and film screenings.Want to get out of the city entirely? Head to Shelter Island, Long Beach, Montauk, the Catskills or more destinations, many accessible by bus or regional train, with a Northeast hotel or B&B deal.--Kelsey Rexroat is a Travelzoo Deal Expert based in New York City.

The whimsical little vegetables resemble scallions, but with wide, flat leaves... Their flavor, however, doesn't resemble that of any other member of the onion family. Ramps can best be described as a cross between green onions and garlic, but there's a wildness to them that's hard to pin down.Here the wild leeks find their way into a soufflÃ© omelet that's as airy as a cloud and incredibly moist. The Robiola cheese that dots the omelet melts very quickly and melds perfectly with the frothy eggs and the pungent ramps.This omelet is incredibly festive and is perfect for brunch. But I also love to serve it for a light weekday dinner, along with a green salad and these irresistible pan-fried smashed potatoes.Note: You can find ramps at your local farmers' market or online at Melissa's Produce.SoufflÃ© Omelet with Robiola and SautÃ©ed RampsServes 4 Active time: 30 minFor the ramps 2 tablespoons unsalted butter 8 oz (225 g) ramps (or scallions) - root ends trimmed, stalks and leaves cut in 1/4"" slices (4 cups) 1/8 teaspoon sea salt Freshly ground black pepper to tasteFor the omelet 1 tablespoon unsalted butter 8 extra large eggs - separated 1/4 cup heavy cream 1/4 teaspoon sea salt Freshly ground black pepper to taste 4 oz (115 g) Robiola (or young Camembert or Goat's Milk Brie) - cut in 1/8"" slicesStep 1: Heat a large heavy-bottomed non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat and add the butter. As soon as the butter is melted, add the ramps. Stir well and sautÃ© for two to three minutes until the ramps are wilted and have turned a shade darker. Add the salt and pepper, stir again and transfer to a bowl. Set pan aside until ready to make the omelet.Step 2: Place the egg yolks, cream, salt and pepper in a large bowl and whisk until well blended. Set aside.Step 3: Place the egg whites in the bowl of an electric mixer and beat at high speed until soft peaks form. Add the egg whites to the egg yolk mixture and carefully fold them in.Step 4: Reheat frying pan over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot, add the butter. When the butter is melted, add the egg mixture. Reduce heat to medium/medium-high and cook the omelet for 2 to 3 minutes, until the eggs begin to set. Place the Robiola slices on top of the omelet and sprinkle the ramps evenly over the whole surface. Cook until the cheese begins to melt and the eggs are cooked to your taste (either runny or firmer), another 2 to 3 minutes. Gently fold the omelet in half and transfer to a serving platter."
