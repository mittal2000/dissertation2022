Titled ""Crossing Christie: What the bridge scandal says about the Governor's political style, and his future,"" Lizza's article -- aptly illustrated with a drawing of the beefy Christie wearing an orange and white traffic cone -- exposes and explains the ugly culture in which the New Jersey governor operates. It's definitely one that I don't want to see in the White House. Yes, I know the late, great Tip O'Neill said politics ain't beanbag. But it ain't the mafia either, where the family and friends of the guy who has just been rubbed out is told, ""Don't take it personal, it's just business.""That's pretty much the way Christie, as well as his supporters and opponents, play the game of politics, according to Lizza, who quotes former Governor Tom Kean, Christie's political mentor, until they had a falling out last November. ""He doesn't always try to persuade you with reason,"" Kean told Lizza. ""He makes you feel that your life's going to be very unhappy if you don't do what he says."" It's a skill Christie demonstrated with the now-famous effort to tie up traffic by limiting access to the George Washington Bridge at Fort Lee in September.Kean added that one of Christie's flaws ""is that he makes enemies and he keeps them. As long as you're riding high, they'll stay in the weeds, because they don't want to get in your way. But you get in trouble, they'll all come out of the weeds, and come at you.""Well, they're coming at him from all directions now and his presidential ambitions after his impressive reelection as governor in November 2013 have been derailed by accusations that he engineered the gridlock on the George Washington bridge as a plot to punish the local mayor for failing to endorse his reelection.But that's apparently just the way they play politics in New Jersey. Screw your enemies and reward your friends. And that's exactly what I don't want to see in the White House, or in Congress or in any statehouse in the U.S. We had that with Nixon and look what happened. Lizza's article delves deeply into Christie's rise from failed state Senate candidate to his campaign for freeholder or county commissioner, which he won with the help of false ads about his three opponents for which he was forced to apologize. The son of one of them said Christie's actions were ""beyond the pale of what anyone had ever done in politics in Morris County. He was a lawyer who said they were being criminally investigated. He looked into the camera and lied.""As soon as he was being sworn in, Christie began campaigning for a state assembly seat. But the fellow Republican he teamed up with, said ""It turned out to be the worst mistake I ever made."" Christie attacked the incumbent assemblyman, who had supported Christie's earlier election, calling his style of politics ""character assassination.""He came in fourth in that election and two years later, lost his freeholder's seat, coming in fifth out of five candidates, and returned to the practice of law. But he hooked up with George W. Bush's presidential campaign as his the lawyer for his New Jersey campaign, and President Bush nominated him as the state's U.S. attorney.""He wasn't the most qualified,"" Kean told Lizza. ""Just on legal expertise and law enforcement expertise, there were people who wanted the nomination were who better qualified.""But Christie got the job in 2002 and did well in it, using it as a springboard for election to governor in 2009. He worked with Democratic Party bosses to pass major legislative initiatives, including a bill to curb the costs of pension and healthcare benefits for public employees, which brought him national attention and sparked talk as a GOP presidential hopeful.But that all came a cropper with the bridge scandal, for which his successor as U.S. attorney is considering a criminal investigation. Although former Gov. Kean believes Christie's insistence that he knew nothing about the lane closures that caused the traffic gridlock, he suggests that Christie ""created an atmosphere"" in which some of his aides ""thought they were doing his will because they were getting back at people."" Kean added, ""If you cross Christie, he will come back at you, even years later.""In sum, I have to say that I agree with the comedian who said to Christie, during a celebrity roast in April to celebrate the 90th birthday for former Gov. Brendan Byrne, ""You scare the shit out of me."""
1,POLITICS,GOP's Old Ploy: Tag President Obama as the Race Baiter,"Earl Ofari Hutchinson, ContributorAuthor and political analyst",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gops-old-ploy-tag-president-obama-as-the-race-baiter_b_5171341.html,"The baiting and the assault on Obama will get even uglier. But it won't change one hard fact: that when it comes to race baiting, the GOP will always have the market cornered on that -- and millions know it.",2014-04-18,"NEW YORK, NY - APRIL 11: U.S. President Barack Obama addresses members of the National Action Network at their 16th annual convention at the Sheraton New York Times Square on April 11, 2014 in New York City. The President spoke about Americans' right to vote, saying state Republican state legislatures nationwide have passed voting fraud laws intended to curb the minority vote. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c50a3c000020010df3d3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The GOP has resorted to another of its time-tested ploys to hammer President Obama. That's to tag him as a race baiter. The take-off point for this old ploy was Obama's keynote address at the recent National Action Network convention. Obama lambasted the GOP for doing everything legally and extralegally it could to obstruct, dampen, and eviscerate minority voting. GOP-controlled legislatures have passed a legion of thinly disguised voter-suppression laws in more than a dozen states. There's also been a steady stream of voting-rights lawsuits and court challenges.Obama's repeated call and frontal challenge to the GOP to back a minimum-wage hike, extension of unemployment insurance, and legislation to deal with the grossly unequal gender gap in pay has further stoked the GOP's ire. The GOP ploy really kicked into high gear when Attorney General Eric Holder had the temerity at the NAN convention to call out the GOP on its blatant race baiting by bluntly demanding, ""What president has ever had to deal with that kind of treatment?"" He meant the racial abuse from the GOP.Holder, as always, was again instantly plopped on the hot seat by GOP pundits, right-wing bloggers, websites, and talk-show hosts and accused of racial polarizing. He didn't back away from his contention, nor should he have. But it wouldn't make much difference anyway. Holder and Obama are African Americans, and there's rarely been a moment during their tenures at the Justice Department and the White House, respectively, that they haven't been relentlessly reminded of that. But while Holder is the convenient whipping boy for the racial table turn by the GOP, the target is really Obama. The one time that he did gingerly venture into the minefield of a racially charged local issue was his mild rebuke of the white officer who had cuffed Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates in 2009. The reaction was instant and furious. Polls after his mild rebuke showed that a majority of whites condemned Obama for backing Gates and, even more ominously, expressed big doubts about his policies. Obama relearned a bitter lesson: If you speak out on an issue that involves race, the backlash will be swift and brutal. And it will be whipped into even greater manic fury by the GOP.The ploy is used to rock Obama back on his heels and box him into a tight racial corner. It's also a serviceable tactic to try to put a brake on Obama's efforts to fire up African Americans and Hispanics to dash to the polls in November. The GOP also has become hypersensitive to the charge that it is racially narrow and insular and a borderline bigoted party. It made a loud but mostly empty effort to try to put a different PR face on the party when it churned out dozens of pages of a blueprint plugging minority outreach. It has even made a few noisy self-righteous and self-serving condemnations of rocker Ted Nugent's racialized words against and about Obama and has tried to put some rhetorical distance between itself and some of the more crackpot statements by GOP state legislators on blacks and Hispanics. But that's more cover than anything, to give credence to its pounding of Obama for allegedly shuffling the race card to divide Americans and retain and win more seats for the Democrats in November. The GOP's racial ploy may loom even larger in the next few months for two reasons. One is that Obama has shown no signs of backing away from his take-off-the-gloves assault on the GOP for voting-rights suppression. He has little choice. The midterm elections are likely to be a cliffhanger for some Democratic incumbents. Their victory will hinge in getting as many blacks and Hispanics to the polls as possible. The GOP historically has had a built-in advantage in off-year elections in that its core supporters -- older, rural and blue-collar whites -- tend to vote in greater percentages than blacks and Hispanics.The other compelling reason is that the GOP banked on hammering red-state Democrats up for Senate reelection with guilt by association with Obama and his Affordable Care Act. But polls now show greater favorable support for the ACA, and the fact that more than 12 million persons have signed up for coverage to date makes this tactic more problematic as a political deal maker for the GOP. If that's pushed further to the back of the GOP's political table, then it's back to an attempted beatdown of Obama with race.The baiting and the assault on Obama will get even uglier. But it won't change one hard fact: that when it comes to race baiting, the GOP will always have the market cornered on that -- and millions know it.Earl Ofari Hutchinson is an author and political analyst.

Airbnb CEO and cofounder Brian Chesky was in our office this morning talking about his company's plans for the future. While he mentioned many interesting things -- the arrival of ""instabooking"" with no back-and-forth required between guests and hosts, an improved double-blind review system that encourages more honesty, the possibility of a future loyalty program -- the most fascinating was his list of the unexpected ways people use Airbnb.1. Neighborhood sampling When you're moving to a new city, it can be difficult to decide which neighborhood is right for you. Enter the Airbnb option: spend a month in, say, L.A., trying out a different area each week. ""Thousands and thousands"" of people use the service this way, Chesky said.2. Visiting family It used to be that if you were visiting family, you would stay with that family. No one booked a hotel just to visit their brother or aunt -- even if they wanted to. But now, Chesky said, he sees people booking a house in the same neighborhood (or even the same apartment building) as their family members. He mentioned one host in New York's Tribeca neighborhood who told him that most of her guests were family members of other residents in her building.3. New grandparents New parents often invite their own parents to help out during the first few weeks or months after the infant comes screaming into the world. Put the in-laws in an Airbnb, and everyone gets a little more privacy.See Also: 11 Meals You Wouldn't Believe Came From an Airplane4. Extended stays Last-minute and spontaneous bookings are a big part of Airbnb's business, but Chesky says extended stays are growing too. ""Ten percent of our business is longterm stays, and it's growing,"" he told us. ""I could easily see that being 15 to 20%."" Chesky thinks his company has a real leg up on the competition in this particular market. ""Airbnb is even better that the competition on stays of 30 days,"" he said. ""Try staying at a friend's house for 30 days and see how they feel. Try staying at a hotel for 30 days and see how you feel.""5. Quirky locations Yes, the perfectly situated apartment in Rome is key to your Italian vacation. But the usual city digs aren't the only thing people are looking for when booking through Airbnb. They want unusual places to say, like boats, treehouses, handmade homes, and yurts. ""We are probably the largest marketplace for boats,"" Chesky said. And the most popular listings are treehouses. ""Investing in treehouses is better than investing in any stock,"" he joked, ""except Airbnb of course."" To find these sorts of quirky lodgings, he recommends the Airbnb app's ""Discovery"" section, which features private islands, windmills, haunted houses, and even buses you can sleep in.More from Condé Nast Traveler:The World's Strangest Natural WondersStop Visiting These Places!
