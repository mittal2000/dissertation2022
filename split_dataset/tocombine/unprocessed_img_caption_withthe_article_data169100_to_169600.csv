A UBS spokesman declined to comment.People familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday UBScould reach a $1-billion-plus settlement and admit to criminal wrongdoing by its Japanese arm, where one of its traders manipulated yen Libor and euroyen contracts.Between 25 and 30 people have left UBS over the matter, the sources said. The Swiss bank had hoped for a softer touch from regulators by cooperating in industry-wide probes and was surprised by the size of the expected settlement, they added.A 1.5 billion franc settlement would be the biggest ever paid by the bank, recovering from a $2.3-billion trading fraud by London-based trader Kweku Adoboli for which it was fined 30 million pounds ($48.36 million) last month.A settlement would make UBS the second major bank to be sanctioned for its role in the Libor scandal. Britain's Barclays paid a $450 million fine in June.Libor is the rate used as a benchmark for pricing trillions of dollars worth of financial instruments and contracts around the globe. Tiny shifts in the rate, compiled from daily polls of bankers, could benefit dealers in complex products. HEADING FOR LOSSTages-Anzeiger said the fine, together with restructuring charges of 500 million francs from plans to cut 10,000 staff as UBS winds down its fixed income business, would probably push the bank to a fourth-quarter loss.UBS had already said costs related to the investment banking overhaul would lead to a fourth-quarter and full-year loss after it posted a third-quarter net loss of 2.172 billion francs. It is due to publish full-year results on Feb. 5.By admitting to a charge against its Japanese subsidiary, UBS would stop short of admitting wrongdoing at a group level, which could be fatal for a bank as it could lose its licence.Chairman Axel Weber, who joined UBS this year after stepping down as head of the German central bank, has been on a whirlwind diplomatic tour over the probe, the Tages-Anzeiger reported.Swiss newspapers noted that Mark Branson, now responsible for overseeing big banks for Swiss financial markets regulator Finma, was chief executive of UBS Japan at the time of the alleged rate rigging.A Finma spokesman said Branson had removed himself from Finma's investigation into Libor to avoid any appearance of conflict of interest but declined to comment futher.In 2009, UBS paid $780 million to settle a messy U.S. investigation into tax evasion by admitting it had helped wealthy Americans evade and cheat on their taxes."

Rick Scott (R), one of the most vocal critics of President Barack Obama's health care reform law, won't carry out a central component of its aim to extend health insurance coverage to poor and middle-class residents of his state.Scott's administration will not create a so-called health insurance exchange under the law, the Miami Herald reported Friday, the deadline for states to notify the Obama administration whether they would manage state-run health insurance exchanges, work in partnership with the Department of Health and Human Services or turn over responsibility totally to the federal government. These health insurance exchanges will be the online gateways where as many as 30 million people will be able to obtain health coverage and access financial assistance starting in 2014 under Obamacare.Scott waited until almost the last minute to announce his decision, despite having been a vehement opponent of the health care reform since the debate started soon after Obama's inauguration in 2009. The former hospital industry executive founded an organization called Conservatives for Patients' Rights and sunk $5 million of his own money into a failed effort to derail the legislation that would come to be known as Obamacare.But after Obama's reelection last month, Scott attempted to strike a conciliatory tone on health care, writing Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius requesting a meeting and telling the Associated Press, ""If I can get to yes, I want to get to yes.""In the end, Scott got back to where he began: No. The Miami Herald reported that his administration blamed a lack of information from the federal government for the decision. ""At this time we do not have sufficient information on the cost of implementing a state health care exchange to Florida taxpayers, Florida businesses or Florida health insurance purchasers,"" said Jackie Schutz, the governor's spokeswoman. ""We are looking forward to getting more information from HHS and the president.”Scott's decision comes with the backing of Republicans in the Florida legislature. The Florida Senate went as far as launching an anti-Obamacare website Thursday.Also on Friday, Utah Gov. Gary Herbert (R) indicated he opposes allowing the federal government to operate an exchange in his state and intends to work with the Obama administration to get Utah's existing health insurance exchange approved under Obamacare. In a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Herberts asked that the federal government approve Utah's exchange, even though it currently only serves small business, not individuals, and doesn't enroll poor people in Medicaid, thus doesn't meet the requirements of the health care reform law. ""I believe that if you consider the Utah version of an exchange in its entirety, you will see we can provide the services Utah needs,"" he wrote.Hours before a midnight deadline, 25 states are on track to default to federal control of the health insurance exchanges in their states, seven will work in partnership with federal authorities, while 18 states and the District of Columbia will operate state-run health insurance exchanges, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. Most states not building exchanges have Republican governors and most states that plan to take on the task are run by Democrats.The health care reform law permits the federal government to run health insurance exchanges in states that don't create their won. This fallback has potential pitfalls however, that could lead to headaches for people seeking health coverage if federal and state regulators are at odds. States with federal exchanges also forgo some authority, such as approving the insurance companies that are allowed to sell health plans on the exchanges in their states. Source: Henry J.

2,BUSINESS,States' Obamacare Decisions Show Entrenched Health Reform Partisanship,Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/states-obamacare-decisions_us_5bb2e097e4b0480ca65dd5a7,CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story used the wrong name for the company Manatt Health Solutions.

(AP Photo/Charles Dharapak, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2e0973c000032000c3a25.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Half of U.S. states have rejected a central component of President Barack Obama's health care reform law, leaving the federal government with less than a year to create online marketplaces for small businesses and uninsured people to shop for health insurance.Obama's 2010 health care law envisioned states taking an active role administering and shaping these marketplaces, called health insurance exchanges. But with a deadline for states to choose a path expiring at midnight Friday, only 18 states and the District of Columbia say they'll be ready to set up and manage exchanges. The exchanges will be the gateway for health insurance coverage and financial assistance, where as many as 30 million people will shop for health plans starting in 2014.The health care overhaul has always been beset by intense partisanship, and the divide over health insurance exchanges is no different. Of the 25 states defaulting to federal control of the new health insurance markets, all but three are run by Republican governors. Just five of the states opting for locally run health insurance exchanges have Republican governors. Seven states plan to partner with the federal government.The Obama administration and the uninsured people it seeks to help confront more than a political setback. Poor coordination between federal and state regulators in locales that opted out of taking charge of their health insurance exchanges may result in headaches for people seeking insurance and financial assistance. Poor people eligible for Medicaid benefits, for instance, could be forced to navigate both federal and state bureaucracies to obtain coverage.Federally run and a state-run health insurance exchanges will enable consumers to choose health plans and obtain subsidies, said Joel Ario, a managing director at the consulting firm Manatt Health Solutions, who ran the health insurance exchange office at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services until last year.""They shouldn't be able to distinguish whether it's state or federal in terms of that core consumer experience,"" Ario said. Still, he said, ""It would be better if the states were more involved"" because states have more expertise regulating health insurance companies and more experience reaching out to beneficiaries, such as through the Medicaid programs they administer. Source: Henry J. Kaiser Family FoundationThe health insurance exchanges are designed for one-stop shopping: Consumers will visit their state's exchange website, dial telephone hotlines or make in-person appointments and share basic personal and financial information. Akin to shopping for airfare on websites like Expedia, the health insurance exchanges will then display the available health plans along with plain-language descriptions of benefits and costs. Customers also find whether their incomes qualify them for financial assistance under the law. The exchanges are scheduled to be operational by Oct. 1, 2013, for people to seek health insurance coverage for 2014. People who earn between the federal poverty level, which is $11,170 for an individual this year, and four times that amount will be eligible for tax credits to defray the cost of private health insurance. Anyone with an income up to 133 percent of poverty, which is $14,856 for a single person this year, would qualify for Medicaid coverage. But that option won't be available to everyone because states are permitted to opt out and not offer this new coverage to their poorest residents.In a nod toward states' rights, the Democrats in Congress who conceived health care reform counted on states, even those governed by opponents of Obamacare, taking responsibilities under the law, such as deciding what health insurance companies are allowed to sell plans to their residents. Doing so also would have given governors a stake in the success of health care reform. With half the states failing to go along, that appears to have been a miscalculation.A handful of Republican-led states -- Idaho, Mississippi, Nevada, New Mexico and Utah -- bucked the trend by grudgingly taking up the health insurance exchanges. In Mississippi, Republican insurance commissioner Mike Chaney is moving ahead with an exchange despite objections from Gov. Phil Bryant (R).Opposition to Obamacare itself is the chief reason governors rebuffed the health insurance exchanges. Although GOP governors like Rick Perry of Texas continue to rail against the health care reform law and could work to obstruct it in their states, they aren't likely to do so, said Jay Angoff, a partner at the law firm Mehri & Skalet and Ario's predecessor at Obama's health insurance exchanges office.""Some of this rhetoric has got to be taken with a grain of salt,"" Angoff said.Republican governors complained that the administration was unresponsive to their questions about the costs and responsibilities states would have to bear. Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon of Missouri offered a similar explanation.Republican governors said they hoped they wouldn't have to make these decisions. But Obamacare survived unyielding Republican opposition in Congress during the debate, more than 30 attempts at repeal by the House GOP, a Supreme Court challenge, and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's vow to eradicate it if elected.Those state leaders who waited for the problem to disappear found themselves short on time after Obama won a second term. ""States that didn't lay the groundwork earlier are hard-pressed now,"" Ario said. Although the Obama administration just published several key regulations last month, the health care law passed more than two years ago, so states have had enough information to get started, said Caroline Pearson, a partner at the consulting company Avalere Health.""We've had a pretty clear vision of what was going to be required or states to do this and any state that was interested in pursuing their own exchange has really been able to move forward,"" Pearson said. Some state leaders did just that. Eighteen states and the District of Columbia plan to set up their health insurance exchanges. Federal authorities already have granted conditional approval to nine of them. Massachusetts and Utah already had exchanges in place, but Utah's still must be cleared by the Obama administration.Wrangling between state leaders and the Obama administration doesn't end with Friday's deadline on health insurance exchanges. Republican governors, including Florida Gov. Rick Scott and Lousiana's Bobby Jindal, are seeking a meeting with Obama to discuss another contentious element of the health care reform law -- its Medicaid expansion, which states administer and partially finance.The Supreme Court ruling in June that upheld Obamacare upended the Medicaid expansion by allowing states to refuse it. Already, nine Republican governors including Rick Perry of Texas and Dennis Daugaard of South Dakota have vowed to opt out and others may follow. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert (R) submitted a budget request to the state legislature this week that assumes his state won't expand Medicaid, for example. Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval is the only Republican so far to embrace a Medicaid expansion.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story used the wrong name for the company Manatt Health Solutions."

Today, we're explaining wassail.You've probably heard, or even sung, the popular Christmas tune, ""Here we come a-wassailing,"" be it a high school choir rendition or a rock band cover. In spite of the song being incredibly catchy and annoyingly repetitive, we're willing to bet that many of those who utter the word ""wassail"" have no idea what it means. So, what is it, anyway? Wassail is a mulled Yuletide punch, served hot. The ingredients of the cider include nutmeg, cinnamon, sugar and ginger, all added to a base of wine or juice. Today, brandy, sherry, and fruits such as apples are typically involved as well, although at the time of the drink's conception, it more closely resembled a mulled beer served with toast. To honor this tradition, modern wassail is still served with toast. The drink usually accompanies the act of wassailing, or singing Christmas carols either from door-to-door, or in apple orchards to encourage a successful harvesting season.Etymology Wassail has a rich linguistic history, as the term is as old as Old English itself. Derived from the Old Norse ""ves heil"" and the Old English ""was hál,"" the term was originally a greeting that meant ""be in good health."" Danish natives in England added to this a reply of ""drink hail,"" a toast that became the norm in the country by the 11th century. History By the 13th century, the use of the wassail bowl had become popular. At that time, it was made of wood or pewter and was used to contain liquids in which breads or cakes could be dipped. From the 14th century through the Renaissance, wassailing involved passing around a single bowl. After taking a drink, the bowl would be passed to the next person accompanied by a kiss. The act of wassailing to promote the growth and wellness of crops emerged in Medieval Britain, and by 1600 the act of carrying the beverage door-to-door while singing had emerged. This early caroling sprung from the concept of ""misrule,"" or the act of traditional social rules being ignored during the holiday season. During this time, the well-off were expected to share their wealth with poorer citizens by inviting them to dine in their homes. Songs were sung in exchange for this hospitality. In popular culture Wassail was referenced in English literature as early as the 8th century, when it appeared in Beowulf: ""The rider sleepeth,the hero, far-hidden; no harp resounds,in the courts no wassail, as once was heard.""How you can enjoy it Alton Brown's wassail recipe from FoodNetwork.com Wassail made with tea from Better Homes and Gardens Traditional wassail from Imbibe Magazine Warm cranberry wassail from Ocean Spray  Also on HuffPost Taste: The Best Hard Apple Cider Brands"

On Aug. 1, 2010, the airline changed its policy. The drink vouchers were now only good on the day the person was traveling, making those previously issued worthless. According to the Tribune, it's estimated that there are 5.8 million eligible vouchers that were never redeemed. And even if eligible passengers don't have their vouchers anymore, the settlement still allows them to redeem new drink vouchers. A article on Law360 further explains:Southwest also agreed to include expiration dates on the post-settlement vouchers and neither retroactively invalidate them nor shorten the expiration period.When the suit was reported by the Los Angeles Times in 2011, Whitney Eichinger, a Southwest spokeswoman, said the decision to add an expiration date was prompted by passengers making unauthorized photo copies of the vouchers. The company explained the decision on its blog:For years, Southwest Airlines has accepted all types of drink coupons on our planes – regardless of their expiration dates. Rapid Rewards coupons. Business Select coupons. Old Company Club coupons. Coupons from the 80s, coupons from the 90s. And we’ve done so for all the right reasons. However, in an industry where the competition is always knocking (or banging) on the door and where watching the bottom-line is more important than ever , we owe it to our Employees, Customers, and Shareholders to find ways to operate smarter. We’ve reached a point where being so flexible with drink coupons has put us in a position of having far too many in circulation. To help purge the system of these excess coupons, we will start enforcing expiration dates on coupons over the course of the next year. Still, according to the Los Angeles Times, the plaintiff argued that the airline had committed a breach of contract.""Southwest decided that it would make more money -- improve its bottom line -- by choosing not to honor the coupons that consumers had already paid and bargained for,"" the plaintiff's complaint said.This isn't the only time Southwest has faced a beverage-related suit. In September of this year, the company was slapped with another lawsuit after a woman claimed she was served hot tea that resulted in second-degree burns, CNN reported.On Friday, the airline announced that they'll be implementing new travel fees in 2013. According to Reuters, fares will be raised for flights on AirTran, which the company acquired last year. Extra charges will also be tied to premium boarding positions, third bags and overweight bags. People who've bought restricted tickets and don't show up for flights will also face extra fees. The airline is planning to raise revenue by by $1.1 billion."

White House spokesman Jay Carney says today is not the day to talk about gun control. I disagree. That's all we should talk about today. We are heartbroken, yes. But saying that will fix nothing. It won't bring anyone back, and it won't keep this from happening again. And of course we know the parents of Newtown could have been any one of us. That's important to remember, but it isn't enough, because the knowing doesn't change the fact that we could still be next. So we can't just do as we did after Columbine, after Virginia Tech, after Aurora. We can't just grieve and hold our children close. We have to demand that our country earn the right to call itself a civilized nation. We need to do this because our central job as parents -- maybe our only job, really -- is to keep our children safe so they can grow up. Easy access to guns keeps us from doing that job. A study in the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery found that the gun murder rate in the U.S. is almost 20 times higher than the next 22 richest and most populous nations combined. Every one of those nations has stricter gun control laws. And then there's this fact: add together all the gun deaths in the 23 wealthiest countries in the world and 80 percent of those are American deaths. Of all the children killed by guns in those nations, 87 percent are American kids. Please don't tell me that if only the staff at Sandy Hook Elementary School were also armed that this would have ended well. It might have ended differently, but concealed weapons in the teachers lounge is not the way we want to raise our kids. Jose Luis Nunez had a handgun in order to protect his son. The 4-year-old accidentally shot himself in the face with it in Houston on Tuesday. Joseph V. Loughrey had one for the same reason. His 7-year-old son Craig died on Saturday outside of Pittsburgh when that handgun accidentally went off while the boy was getting into his safety seat in front of a gun store. And that was just this week. The same week that the NRA proudly tweeted it had reached 1.7 million ""likes"" on Facebook. We cherish individuality in America. We see raising children as no one else's business, and we have never managed to band together as a ""parenting"" bloc. It is time. Guns are a parenting issue and we need to control them in the name of the children who died this morning. Even more, we need to do it in the name of their mothers and fathers. So cry today. Comfort your kids. Curse, and pray. Then pick up the phone, a pen, a keyboard, or your checkbook and make your demands heard. All day and every day. But most especially today.This appears in Issue 28 of our weekly iPad magazine, Huffington, in the iTunes App store, available Friday, Dec. 21.Related on Huffington Post: "

A gunman entered the school Friday morning and killed at least 26 people, including 20 young children. (AP Photo/The New Haven Register, Melanie Stengel)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ca03026000035007f8daf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"How do you talk with your children about an unspeakable crime? It's a heartwrenching reality as the country takes in one of the worst school shootings in U.S. history. Twenty children, mainly kindergartners, and 7 adults, including the shooter, died after a shooting rampage this morning at an elementary school in Connecticut.The gunman entered Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, CT early this morning and opened fire. Police are working on the motive, but sources say that the suspect had a connection to the school. One of the teachers was among the first killed early in the day and many of the young victims were her students.How do you reassure your kids, let alone yourself, that school is a safe enriching haven that provides the education they need to get ahead in this world? It's a difficult task, to say the least. As parents, we are faced with comprehending the news, fearing for our own children and wanting to make some kind of sense out of an elementary school shooting that will certainly go down in history as one of the most hideous crimes committed against our children.I am a parent who lives near enough to the tragedy it is hard to describe the sinking feeling of fear, disgust, sorrow and even terror our community feels. And as a child psychologist charged with trying to make sense of the tragedy, I am indeed overwhelmed.It is important to focus on what we can do now, not on what has already happened. It is likely that many children will hear about this tragedy on television, online, in school, on the bus. What parents can do is prepare themselves to field questions and provide honest yet helpful answers.Here are just a few helpful hints to consider:If you are not sure your child knows about the tragedy, wait until he says something about it to you. Some children are more in tune with the world around them than others. Today, the president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Thomas McInerny, MD, FAAP, issued a statement offering condolences and tips for parents. ""As in any frightening situation, young children should not be exposed to the extensive media coverage of the event -- in other words, turn off the TV, computer and other media devices.""If your child asks you what happened keep it simple and developmentally appropriate. If, for example, your child indicates that she heard that someone came to a school and killed children you should be honest but gentle. Preface your affirmation by reassuring her that this is called a tragedy because it is so rare and unexpected. Even if your child seems more curious than scared or anxious when he asks you about the incident, reassurance is essential. It may take some time for him to really process the information and the feelings it evokes for him. If she is clearly upset and scared help refocus her emotions. Suggest an age appropriate project you can do with her to help her manage. Perhaps she can make a drawing or a collage of happy things for the kids at the school or write a letter in support of them. Don't be afraid to let your child know that you, too, feel sad. He takes his cues from you. If he expresses that he is scared or even afraid to go to his school, let him know you understand why he feels this way. Reassure him that his school is safe and that because of these events all schools will be making even greater efforts to remain safe.Do not act hysterical or terrified in front of her. These events are difficult for everyone to manage but, as mentioned, she does take her cues from you. If you express overwhelming fear or anxiety she may react in kind.Go out of your way to make some family time. Tragedies such as this one remind us how lucky we are. Forget about folding the laundry or making that call, there will be time later. Take a moment to enjoy your family.

Because today, in Newtown, Connecticut, for many parents, teachers, and children, the end of the world has arrived, about a week ahead of schedule. And we're well into a new era, one in which news of a school shooting, or a theater shooting, or a mall shooting, is just an ordinary part of our morning news.Anyone who knows me -- in fact, anyone who read my post on July 22, 2012, just after the Aurora shootings -- knows that I have two great loves in life: my children, and the Supreme Court. As I wrote back then, it's rare that these two passions intersect. In fact, most Americans would say that the Supreme Court is almost never relevant in their lives, and certainly not relevant to their children's lives.The school shootings over the past 13 years or so are evidence of just how wrong they are. Because the Supreme Court's decisions over the past four or five years have guaranteed the rights of most Americans to bear arms, and though those rights may be limited for people with certain kinds of documented mental illnesses or felony records, the Court's interpretation of the Second amendment to the United States Constitution has made it difficult to stop most gun sales before tragedy occurs.Because I'm a Supreme Court expert, I'm often asked how many more Justices President Obama will have the opportunity to appoint. I don't know the answer, of course (Justices don't have to retire until they want to, and it's impossible to predict death or incapacity during life tenure), but I'd make an educated guess that lightning will strike at least twice over the next four years. Because I'm a mother, I'm often asked how these school shootings make me feel. And I'll tell you how they make me feel. They make me feel unbelievably angry. No, unlike my Facebook friends who post that they're stunned, or in a state of disbelief, or saddened, or grieving, I'm just plain bullshit mad. Because the Supreme Court expert in me is talking to the mother in me. And the Supreme Court expert in me knows that the only way to even think about stopping the carnage that the mother in me hates is to appoint Justices to the bench who believe that the Court's current interpretation of the Second Amendment is wrong. Even one new Justice who believed that guns were for militias, not individuals, could vote to change the law, perhaps for decades, perhaps for the entire rest of my children's lifetimes. And my worries about putting my children on the school bus would be much more about whether the bus would crash or some mean kid would bully them than about whether they'd come home in a body bag. And my children would only have to worry about whether my grandchildren would be able to teletransport themselves home safely at the end of the day instead of whether those grandchildren would fall to the floor in some public school classroom, full of bullet holes. Honestly, folks, it's that easy. Put people in the Senate who will make gun rights and the Second Amendment the threshold question for whether a nominee is qualified. Forget abortion -- we've been fighting about that for 40 years, and nominees are just not going to answer that question. (Remember Clarence Thomas back in the '90s, who claimed he had never discussed Roe v. Wade?) Forget gay marriage -- the Court has already agreed to hear challenges to laws prohibiting recognition of it, and I predict that, by June, the Constitution will guarantee that anyone can marry the person she loves, just as our children already think she should be able to. Vote for senators who will refuse to confirm a nominee who thinks it is OK for an individual to own a gun that can slaughter most of an elementary school. Who will think that the day a school shooting occurs is the absolute right time to talk about gun control. Who will, when the Supreme Court changes its interpretation of the Second Amendment -- and remember, it will only take ONE conservative Justice replaced by one liberal or moderate one -- vote to pass strict gun control laws, keeping guns out of the hands of those who would use them to hurt children, and parents, and teachers, and communities.Otherwise, folks, we're looking at the end of the world."

It sucked, but you survived. Rather than jumping directly into another relationship, you took some time to process the whole thing. Kudos to you for acting like a grown up during your break-up -- even if your ex didn't act like one during your relationship. Now that the trauma has receded and your period of reflection has come to an end, you feel like you're ready to start dating again. But there are a couple of questions that are nagging at you: Has the betrayal you experienced in your last relationship affected your ability to trust someone in the future? And perhaps more importantly, should it?Those are excellent questions. Navigating a new relationship after getting cheated on in your last relationship can be tricky business. And while it's wise to give previous experiences enough consideration to learn how to avoid making the same mistakes in the future, you don't want to give them so much weight that they keep you shackled to your past. As the saying goes, ""Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me."" The fact that you got cheated on was not your fault. But it will be your fault if you repeat your own mistakes the next time around. The following five tips can help to maximize your chances for successfully moving forward. 1. Forgive but don't forget. Wait -- before you post that angry comment, let me explain. I'm not talking about forgiving him; I'm talking about forgiving yourself for your own lapses in judgment. Maybe you believed him when he said the only reason he went to Sugar's every day for lunch was because the strip steak special just couldn't be beat. Or you ignored the story you heard about how his last relationship ended when his then-girlfriend found a half-empty box of condoms tucked in a pocket of the suitcase he took on his frequent business trips. Maybe you thought you could change him. Or you didn't listen to your gut when it kept telling you that something was wrong. There are real lessons to learn from all of these mistakes. But once you learn them, your job is to forgive yourself while not forgetting what you learned. 2. It's not you, it's him. Whatever your shortcomings were, he was the one who cheated, not you. You may have ignored the warning signs, but that goes in the category of letting yourself down; it doesn't rise to the level of betraying your significant other's trust. In terms of culpability, there's a big difference between those two offenses. Being guilty of one requires asking and answering some tough questions of yourself. Being guilty of the other requires answering up when you ultimately meet your maker. Don't let his betrayal change the essence of who you are. If you're a trusting person by nature, that's a good thing. But if you're a trusting person who ignores red flags, change the part about ignoring red flags. In other words, do let the whole experience generate healthy growth, but don't let it rob you of your positive qualities. 3. Get a new type. If you're a person who has a ""type"" and your ex is a representative sample, it may be time to get a new type. If you have a history of being attracted to guys who are players, you won't be entitled to any sympathy points when you start dating another guy who has a ""bad boy"" reputation and then he ends up cheating on you, too. So before you dive back into dating, think about what you want from your love life. Do your spirits soar at the thought of turbulence, bumpy air space, and crash landings? Or do you like generally smooth sailing? Once you have the answer to this question, pick a guy who's interested in traveling in both the same manner and direction. 4. Don't convict the wrong guy. Once you start dating someone new, don't expect him to serve the sentence for the crime committed by your ex. There is no faster way to kill your next relationship than to send your new boyfriend the message that you expect him to cheat on you any second -- or worse yet, to treat him as if he already has. Neither the victim vibe nor passion for payback are attractive to healthy individuals. So, if Beaten-down Becca is your post break-up persona, you should automatically be suspect of any new suitors. And if you are Vengeful Vanna dedicated to punishing your subsequent boyfriend for the pain caused by your last one, don't expect relationship success to be your good fortune. The bottom line is this: If you are not at the point where you can let a new relationship grow without poisoning it with your past experience, then don't start dating yet because you are not ready.5. Check your suitcase for any emotional baggage. After you break up with a cheater, there are two nasty parting gifts that often sneak into your suitcase when you pack your stuff. One is fear and the other is insecurity. Fear that someone might cheat on you again can make you skittish of emotional vulnerability -- a necessary component in any healthy relationship. That fear can cause you to cut and run rather than moving forward with a relationship that has real potential. On the other hand, insecurity about your own self-worth and the prospect of being alone can keep you from breaking it off with someone you know is not good for you. You've heard of gifts that keep giving. Well, these are gifts that keep taking. Sort through all of your stuff to make sure that these two saboteurs aren't stowed away, waiting for the chance to undermine your prospects for healthy relationships in the future.   Conventional wisdom holds that cheaters never win. But I disagree; they win if you let them by failing to learn and move on. If you do your part to keep the cheaters from winning, your efforts will be richly rewarded in the future."

And each week, new ones magically appeared, kind of like the cake factory scene in that old I Love Lucy episode where an endless stream of confections keeps coming down the line.I stuck with it for two long years before I found the delicious new man in my life.

I share them here not only for readers who are amused by odd human encounters, but to hopefully inspire those trudging the online trenches. You are not alone. Horrible dates happen to all of us. Keep your sense of humor and keep going -- it will get better! 1. The Pet Date. After a brief phone conversation, I met a man at the Santa Monica Pier on a Sunday afternoon. He had a dog with him, a nervous looking mutt with very long ears and very short legs. ""It's my ex-wife's,"" he explained. ""I look after it when she goes out of town."" He glanced at me like he thought I'd think he was a nice guy for doing that. I tried to stay neutral, though by now, the dog was jumping on my pants in a really irritating way. We started down the boardwalk, the dog skittering back and forth like it was trying to trip me. My date seemed oblivious. His phone rang. ""It's my ex-wife,"" he said, like it was Joe Biden calling. A heated argument ensued as the ex harangued him for not taking the dog to the dog park as instructed. He got off the phone and launched into a rant about what a bitch she was and how she'd told him he was bad in bed. ""Why on earth do you babysit this woman's dog?"" I asked. ""If I don't, she'll make me take it to a pet motel,"" he said. ""And I'm sick of paying for it!"" I didn't go online for at least three days.2. The Sad Widower. I'd noticed there were a lot of widowers online. They seemed nice and non-threatening and I'd emailed with several. I'd even sent a couple of condolences. Finally, I decided to meet one, a man who had sent a heartfelt email in which he confided he badly needed to live again. We had a nice conversation and the date seemed to be going well. Two drinks later, he leaned closer and said that if we became an item, we'd always have to go to my house. ""Oh? Why's that?"" I said, wondering how we got to this topic so fast. He grinned boyishly and revealed that he and his wife still lived in the same house but led separate lives. I was, as they say in the U.K., gobsmacked. ""Why did you say you were a widower?!"" ""If I said I was still married, no one would want to go out with me,"" he replied. ""Women like widowers."" 3. The Blind Date. A friend knew we were both online dating and thought we might be a match. His profile revealed that he was a good-looking media spokesperson for a high-end dog food company. He was going to be in our city and my friend had arranged for me to pick him up so he could take me to dinner. I arrived at his motel and called from the car. ""I'm not ready yet,"" he said. ""Will you come up?"" My friend knew this man fairly well, so I went up to his room and knocked on the door. The door opened to reveal Mr. Kibble standing there stark naked and very relaxed about it. I was proud of myself in that moment. Even though I felt primitive heart-pounding fear, I stayed calm as the part of me that revels in strange moments clapped her hands with a gleeful, ""I don't believe this!"" ""I see you're not dressed yet,"" I said demurely. ""I'll be in the car."" I walked to the parking lot, quelling my urge to run like the wind, then drove home.4. Going Dutch. I met him in a noisy little sports bar. I ordered a chardonnay. He ordered coffee. We had little in common. It was all pretty benign except for one startling moment when he dropped into the conversation that his mother made him put his hand in her vagina starting at age four. After the requisite 45 minutes I said I had to go home. He paid the check and we left. An hour later, I received a very long, angry email. He wrote that he felt very annoyed with himself and with me. He was sick of feeling taken advantage of by people and not speaking up. He was referring to my letting him pay the check. Jeez, I only had a $5 glass of house wine! He railed me for not paying for my drink and ended by firmly stating that on all our future dates we would be going dutch thank you very much! 5. Hidden Agendas. He suggested we meet for at a wonderful little Japanese restaurant. There was no attraction but we chatted and the food was excellent. ""Do you always have a wonderful dinner on a first date?"" I asked. ""No,"" he said. He'd read on my profile that I was a therapist and thought I could help him. He was obsessively in love with a woman in Minneapolis. He hadn't seen her in seven months and it was killing him. I popped a spring roll in my mouth and gently explained I couldn't conduct therapy under these conditions. But I said he could just talk if he wanted and I'd just keep eating -- which I did, and then went home.If you've had a horrifying first date, please share below.
