0,DIVORCE,Seven Ways To Leave A Cheater,"Tracy Schorn, Contributor
Blogger and cartoonist at Chump Lady",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/seven-ways-to-leave-a-che_us_5b9c8efee4b03a1dcc7fcc86,Leaving a cheater is an intimidating process.,2012-12-07,"Unhappy couple breaking. Angry woman pointing out, man packing his clothes into suitcase.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c8efe2200003000d948c1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Leaving a cheater is an intimidating process. It's not like you want to blurt out to everyone in your life, ""Hey, Bob won't quit cheating on me. Do you know a good divorce attorney?"" And anyone close to you who knows, like your father, probably will not give the best advice. Mine would have preferred to steer me away from the legal system entirely and straight toward the shotgun he keeps in the front hall closet.So how do you do it? Here is your step-by-step guide.1. Do NOT tip your hand. This is the first rule. It's so tempting to flounce off to a lawyer and announce it to your cheater, expecting that boy, they'll see you really mean it this time! And half expecting them to do some Hail Mary maneuver to win you back. Bad move. When you tell your cheater that you're seeing a lawyer, all this does is kick them into high gear to hide the evidence, screw you over financially and get to the biggest pit bull attorney in town first before you do. They're probably doing that at the very same time they are trying to throw you off the trail with ""remorse"" and ""needing time"" and booking trips to the marriage counselor. Hide the payment to the attorney as well, by whatever means necessary.2. Do not think, ""Oh they would never..."" Oh, they would never ask for full custody. Oh, they would never hide money. Oh, they would never throw me out of the house. Yes they would. Anyone who would screw around on you and expose you to STDs and gamble with the well-being of their children is certainly capable of all sorts of things. Your cheating spouse is not your friend. These are acts of aggression and you need to protect yourself accordingly. The best approach is to treat this like you are severing a business relationship. Detach. But do not ever for one second think that this person will treat you fairly because you shared a life together.3. Gather your evidence. Evidence is important and your lawyer will know what to do with it. Back up copies of everything, put them on a flash drive, email stuff to yourself at another account -- store it away safely.4. Find a good family law attorney. Make sure they specialize in family law. Look online to find the top professionals in your area recommended by other attorneys. Hiring a lawyer is expensive, but you can do some of the work yourself, such as copying and research. Ask your lawyer how you can help make this affordable. A good experienced lawyer will usually get you a much better settlement and will push the process along faster. Remember, your lawyer is not your therapist. Save your emotions for people who don't bill in six minute increments.5. Move the money. Move half of all cash and liquid assets into your own account that only you can access. Cut off all credit cards you have in common. Check your credit report to look for weird charges. Any money spent on an affair is usually marital money you can ask for back in a divorce. Also, run a credit report on your spouse. You can do this free online. You will have to answer some identifying questions (such as the amount of your last car payment), but this can unearth a wealth of information, like credit cards you don't know about or post office boxes. Usually cheaters have slush funds to hide the evidence of their cheating. If you don't want to be an amateur sleuth on the divorce finances, hire a forensic accountant.6. Go no contact. How you announce you're divorcing is a very personal decision. You might just want your cheater served at work. Or do it in the therapist's office. Or if your cheater is volatile, be very careful and just get out safely. Don't be afraid to seek the services of a domestic abuse hotline. Whether you remain separated but living together (pure hell, don't do this unless you absolutely must), or one of you moves out, don't talk with your cheater unless it is about kids or finances. Preferably do all this communication by email so it is documented. It's easier to be less emotional this way as well. No contact means less pain. Don't get sucked back into their drama. Don't tell them how you hurt (they don't care, and if they act like they care, it's usually to further manipulate you). Now is the time for crickets.7. Stay strong. You're going to get wobbly. It's entirely human. You will doubt that you're doing the right thing sometimes. You'll fear for your children. Stay the course. If your cheater is sorry, they will do the hard work and be sorry regardless of what you do. If a cheater tries to derail the divorce, it's because they don't want the consequences for themselves. That isn't remorse. It's self interest. When you feel weak, it's good to look at that evidence again and let the anger fuel you forward. Focus on yourself. What kind of person do you want to share your life with? What are your values? Divorce because of infidelity is terribly painful, but it's also birthing pains to a new beginning. The pain is finite. Push past it. There's a good life here waiting for you."

If you're one of the many men planning to get down on one knee, you've likely already bought the ring -- now it's time to decide how you'll ask the love of your life to marry you. Not the easiest of tasks!Here are five ideas for making the big moment extra special. With some attention to detail, you'll be able to look back on the joyous occasion with relief and reminisce about how you planned it all perfectly.1. Have some delectable goodies on hand. The romantic pairing of champagne and strawberries may be thought of as cliché to some, but I like to think of this combination as classic instead. After all, champagne is the traditional toasting beverage -- its effervescence is the epitome of festivity! And few things go better with champagne than strawberries. (I happen to love BobaluBerries, which are dipped in chocolate.) By setting a tone for quality with some festive treats, you'll make the event more memorable. 2. Don't forget sound effects. Having a bit of background music not only will ease your pre-proposal nerves (nothing is more anxiety-inducing than silence, after all!), but it will also set a romantic tone. Whether you create a playlist of songs that remind you of your soon-to-be fiancée or just cue up ""your song"" to play right at the perfect moment, you can't go wrong with some special tunes to create ambiance. 3. Snap some photos.  While some men choose to have a photographer waiting on the outskirts to capture the moment professionally, you don't have go to such length (or expense) if you prefer a more private proposal. Just be sure to have a smartphone or your own camera ready so you can snap some ""just engaged!"" photos to share with friends and family (trust me, they'll ask for them!). You might even consider making a keepsake book of the shots through sites like SmugMug to give to your fiancée at a later date. 4. Be sure to stay warm.  It doesn't get more romantic than a fireside proposal (just don't forge to open the flue if you haven't used your hearth in a while!). Not only does the fire create the perfect atmosphere, it will also help keep you warm while you pop the question. If you're going to do an outdoor proposal in winter, remember that nothing kills the mood faster than a freezing fiancée-to-be! Be sure to tell your girlfriend to bundle up before you head out to your chosen location or have a throw blanket or jacket waiting for her there.5. Surprise your new fiancée with wedding fun. Buy a few bridal magazines before the proposal so you can present them packaged in a pretty box or wrapped with a bow. She'll be excited to start scoping out dresses and ideas -- plus, you'll score extra points for being so thoughtful."

Who better than the queen of butter to provide you with a rich, creamy, booze-filled recipe?When it comes to eggnog, there's no holding back (and Paula never does). It's all about the eggs, sugar and cream. And more importantly, the booze. Check out the video above to see how she gets it done. But if the thought of drinking a cup of raw eggs leaves you with the shakes -- eggnog does largely consist of completely raw eggs which poses the danger of salmonella poisoning -- try Martha Stewart's ""safe"" eggnog recipe. The baked eggnog method cooks egg yolks with milk and sugar to make a rich custard. The result is a little thicker than the traditional version, but tastes just as good. Just don't forget the spoon, which is the traditional way you're suppose to enjoy this drink anyway. For some people it's not the eggs, but all the dairy, that makes eggnog nauseau inducing. We've got a solution for that too. You can make it with coconut and almond milk. (Clearly, we want to make sure everyone has eggnog this season.)If all this sounds like too much work, just cut to the chase and buy eggnog (check out the best from our taste test).

3,MONEY,How the Fiscal Cliff Could Hurt Your Credit,"Jeff Hindenach, Contributor

Another recession could mean a number of things, including a higher unemployment rate, a slower economy and, of course, more debt. So what does that mean for credit?",2012-12-07,"FILE - This Nov. 16, 2012 file photo shows President Barack Obama, accompanied by House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio, speaking to reporters in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, as he hosted a meeting of the bipartisan, bicameral leadership of Congress to discuss the deficit and economy in Washington. Americans are living longer, and Republicans are proposing to raise the Medicare eligibility age as part of a deal to reduce the government's huge deficits. But what sounds like a common-sense sacrifice for an aging society that's facing tight budgets could have some surprising consequences, including higher premiums for people on Medicare. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c97713c00004c0009d212.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the president and Congress battle it out over their plans to avoid the fiscal cliff, the deadline for making a decision gets closer and closer. While the immediate effects would be a big increase in taxes for 90 percent of the population, the lasting effects could mean a weaker economy and quite possibly another recession. If the country slips into another recession, that could have major consequences for the entire credit industry, including your credit. Learning From the Last RecessionFalling off the fiscal cliff could mean another recession for the country. Another recession could mean a number of things, including a higher unemployment rate, a slower economy and, of course, more debt. So what does that mean for credit? If the last recession is any indication, these are some credit issues we might face:Tighter lending standards: During the last recession, lenders tightened their standards when it came to whom they were lending. From mortgages to credit cards, it was harder for most Americans to gain a loan or a line of credit, especially if they didn't have an excellent credit score. Higher interest rates: Not only will it be harder to get a loan or a line of credit, it will probably be more expensive. The country has its own ""credit score,"" called a credit rating. If America's credit rating goes down, they are seen to be a greater risk, and the government's borrowing rate goes up. If the government's rate goes up, so do the corporate rates in the country, which means higher interest rates on mortgages, car loans, student loans and credit cards. The credit rating agencies have already said that they are considering downgrading the U.S. if the fiscal cliff situation is not resolved. Lowered credit limits: Not only can credit cards offer lower credit limits on new accounts, but then can cut credit limits on existing accounts. A lower credit limit means you're using a higher percentage of your available credit, even if your debt doesn't change. This gives you a higher credit utilization ratio, which in turn will lower your credit score.What You Can Do to PrepareUnlike the last recession, we know this one is coming if the fiscal cliff problem is not solved. If you are worried about your credit score or your ability to get a loan or line of credit during the next recession, there are some things you can do to prepare. Start saving now: Make sure you will be able to cover all of your bills in the coming year, including the increase in taxes that the fiscal cliff will bring. ""Any time cash flow gets tighter, it's possible to see a domino effect as one bill becomes late, which makes the next bill late, and so on,"" warns Beverly Harzog, credit card expert and author of The Complete Idiot's Guide to Person-to-Person Lending. ""Those who have savings will have a better chance to survive an increase in tax payments.""Not only will you have to foot the bill for your increased taxes, but the recession also raises questions of unemployment, lowered credit limits, and other financial uncertainties. Having a stockpile of cash can not only alleviate some of the financial strain, but also help you pay your bills on time so your credit score isn't affected. Make sure your credit report is clean: Now is the time to do everything you can to boost your credit score. Find a credit report monitoring service that can help you check your report for any mistakes or false information. And here is a list of other ways you can help build up your credit score. Apply for your loans or lines of credit now: If you think you might have trouble getting loans or lines of credit after the recession hits, it might be a good idea to apply for those now, especially credit cards. Of course, don't rush into any major decisions about a house or a major loan, but keep in mind that credit might be harder to come by if we slip into another recession. And if credit limits are lowered on your existing cards, it will help to have the additional credit that a new credit card can offer.Bottom line, going over the fiscal cliff could do some serious damage to the economy, which in turn could affect your financial security in the coming years. Make sure you are prepared for any financial issues now to avoid any problems in the future."

6,PARENTING,Dr Toy's Rx: Play Is Essential,"Stevanne Auerbach, Contributor
Ph.D., Author, Consultant, Speaker",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/play_us_5b9c9694e4b03a1dcc801426,"While a good play environment and the right types of toys are important, the participatory role of parents is crucial.",2012-12-07,Kids playing with plastic blocks - two boys and girl,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c96941f000051002147d8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It is important to monitor children's time spent with electronics, TV and other media. Watching TV is rote and passive, while physical play can contribute to a child's optimal mental, physical, social and emotional development. Play is a natural drive to discover the essence of a happy childhood. While TV and electronics can be an easy, simple substitute, playful interaction with playmates and toys is essential for a child's full development. Turning on TV and foregoing time for playfulness underestimates the importance of play and its essential role in learning and growth.Babies and toddlers need sounds (music, talking, nature) and playful parents. Balance is essential, not just the first two years, but throughout childhood. Playing games, building with blocks or construction toys, creating projects, reading aloud, solving puzzles and playing outdoors are great ways to play. So, too, is playing with dolls, creating a puppet theatre from a cardboard box and having fun with transportation toys and many other play things. When young children have plenty of time to play, absorbing, practicing, learning from mistakes, and, most of all, discovering new things, they develop crucial skills. As infants grow, they play with innumerable things around them: their hands, toes, sunbeams coming in the window, and soft toys. They also discover sounds when babbling and talking to themselves. TV and electronic devices, while fun to use, interfere with natural forms of play and, in my opinion, should not be substituted for hands-on creative play.  Three types of toys contribute to the development of children: active, creative and educational. Active playthings like balls, bicycles and jump ropes, improve a child's physical activity and provide exercise.  Creative toys stimulate the child's imagination at all levels, as the child experiences surprise and expands thinking and self-expression. Creative toys include blocks, building toys, crafts, dollhouses, mirrors, musical instruments, puppets, stuffed animals and art supplies.  Educational toys help child learn specific skills, sometimes simultaneously. Any toy can be educational if used in an enriching way. These include board games, books, construction toys, pegboards, puzzles and audio and video media. Play helps with reading, writing and building skills that prepare for math and science.   While a good play environment and the right types of toys are important, the participatory role of parents is crucial. Regardless of work schedule, taking the time to play reduces stress, improves communications and adds laughter and relaxation to all members of the family, especially the youngest ones. Parents should encourage and stimulate the child's Play Quotient (PQ). As the child's ""Play Guide,"" parents teach skills to be happier and get along better with others. Parents enhance a child's ""PQ"" by choosing toys carefully, joining in their play, and taking the time to read. Playful parents (and teachers) encourage a child to be playful -- a more playful child is more aware, smarter and resilient. The benefits are enormous. Every library and preschool should consider creating a toy lending library to make toys easier to obtain, share and learn about. Turn off TV and turn on play, for happier and healthier children (and adults).  Let's play!© 2012 Stevanne Auerbach, PhD, Dr. Toy"

Being a ""half-full glass"" type of person, I thought that I might use this experience to really challenge myself to change my relationship with food and my health. With that in mind, I set out to manage a budget of $200 for a two-family home that included my toddler son and myself. My aim was eat food that would keep us functioning in health and well-being as we navigated this seemingly difficult period. I started by acknowledging my addiction to sugar and baked goods. I can't explain it well, but there was a time when I could sit down before a batch of cookies or several bagels and within a couple of hours, they would all be gone. The first bite of sugar and bread would trigger the thought that I had to eat them all in order to feel satisfied. My decision to get free of sugar and flour was supported by my son's diagnosis of a wheat allergy. Moreover, sugar would become a pricey luxury, with my uncontrollable cravings, if we were going to live on $200 of food stamps each month. With the help of Food Addicts Anonymous (a great program that's free!), I was off sugar and flour and fitting into size 27 jeans. I was also learning to deal with the emotions that fueled my addiction to sugar, which typically plagued me during stressful times. Grocery shopping shifted dramatically. I began purchasing our produce and eggs at the local farmers' market. I purchased organic and antibiotic-free meats, poultry and fish to assist our long-term health. A neighbor and I started a garden in which we grew some of the vegetables we use daily, like lettuce, kale, and tomatoes. Shopping at the local farmers' market and gardening have given me a sense of connection to my community -- and to the planet -- that simply didn't exist before now. They also help me teach my son about where his food comes from. Preparing all our meals helps me be present and slower in my life. Slowly but surely, I'm beginning to include my son in food preparation so that he will learn to care for himself and others as he gets older. The best benefit is that my cholesterol numbers are much better, and I no longer run marathons to fight off the extra weight that often comes with aging. I'm healthy, my son is healthy, and I feel good and responsible. Several amazing benefits of my food-stamp diet have changed my life. I understand healthy eating in a whole new way. Eliminating processed foods has also freed me from the digestive pains, constipation, gas, and bloating that I lived with daily. Not binge-eating sugar gives me the space to feel my feelings and face challenges head-on. Not to mention that my brain is no longer constantly telling me I'm hungry. After eating a plate of seasonal vegetables, a small serving of meat, poultry or fish and a hearty salad, I'm satisfied. Just the other day I visited my doctor for my annual check-up. It was wonderful to hear him say I have a perfect bill of health -- my weight is exactly where it should be, and my blood work couldn't be better. I could never have imagined that something that initially seemed so humiliating would turn out to be one of the greatest teaching events of my life. Although my food stamp benefit itself will be ending soon because I no longer require assistance, the benefits to my lifestyle are not. I've learned not only how to eat better on less, but also that the actual benefits of public assistance programs cannot be evaluated in terms of the government dollars spent. When our society looks at the costs of assisting people in times of need, we might well be mindful of the many unexpected, unknown blessings that such assistance can bring.For more by Monique Ruffin, click here.For more on diet and nutrition, click here."
