As you'll see through the eyes of a serviceman using bath salts, your friends may appear to transform to demons and zombies, you stand to wind up in emergency surgery -- or, possibly, Davy Jones' Locker -- and, even if you survive, the hallucinations and paranoid delusions can linger after the high is gone, for weeks.

1,BUSINESS,Australia Tobacco Tax: Price Of Cigarettes To Exceed $20 A Pack,Hunter Stuart,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/australia-tobacco-tax-cigarette-prices-pack_us_5bb2e2d3e4b0480ca65dfe9f,"In September, the Australian Associated Press reported that tobacco tax revenue fell by $341 million.

Health advocates declared a 'brave new world of tobacco control' following Australia's historic packaging victory over the cigarette industry, but analysts warn that smoking is far from a dying trade. AFP PHOTO / / FILES / Greg WOOD (Photo credit should read GREG WOOD/AFP/GettyImages)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2e2d33c000032000c3abc.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you think cigarettes are expensive in the United States, be glad you don't live in Australia, where the price of a pack of smokes is set to rise to above $20, according to The Australian. The higher price for cigarettes is the result of a rise in the tobacco tax, which government officials say they hope will not only increase revenues by billions of dollars over the next few years, but encourage smokers to kick the habit.""Price increases encourage existing smokers to quit and raise the barrier for people considering taking up smoking, especially young people,"" the government-sponsored National Tobacco Strategy reads, as The Australian notes.This isn't the first time the Australian government has raised taxes on tobacco, however. In 2010 it increased taxes on tobacco products by 25 percent, provoking panic among smokers, according to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.The new tobacco tax comes in conjunction with new cigarette packaging restrictions in Australia, which forbid tobacco companies from including any branding on cigarette labels, the Guardian reports. As of Dec. 1, cigarette packages must use generic fonts and a drab olive-brown color meant to discourage consumers.Australia's tobacco tax isn't the country's only sin tax. Australia also taxes beer and alcohol, with higher taxes placed on beverages that have higher alcohol content. Although higher tobacco taxes may reduce smoker addiction rates, at least one study has shown that such ""nanny taxes,"" as they are often called, sometimes place a greater burden on lower-income consumers, the Australian reports.But the increase in the tobacco tax may not bring in the higher revenues the Australian government is hoping for. In September, the Australian Associated Press reported that tobacco tax revenue fell by $341 million. The federal government says its anti-smoking measures likely contributed to the drop, according to the report. "
2,BUSINESS,Fiscal Cliff Deal Brings Business Big Benefits Even As Execs Carp,Chris Kirkham,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/fiscal-cliff-business_us_5bb2e2e9e4b0480ca65dff62,"""They're rather hypocritical about their 'shared sacrifice,'"" said Robert McIntyre, director of the progressive group Citizens",2013-01-05,"US President Barack Obama (R) listens as Honeywell Chairman and CEO David Cote speaks on the economy following a meeting with business leaders at the White House in Washington, DC, January 28, 2009.

Executives who have banded together in recent months as part of the Campaign to Fix the Debt, a coalition of current and former politicians and business leaders, have at the same time been lobbying to preserve the tax perks their companies have enjoyed for years.""They're rather hypocritical about their 'shared sacrifice,'"" said Robert McIntyre, director of the progressive group Citizens for Tax Justice. ""It's shared by anyone but them.""Honeywell's Cote said any real debt proposal needs to include ""meaningful entitlement and tax reform."" He urged leaders in Congress to ""put politics aside and work out a plan that will truly help to expand the U.S. economy over the long term.""Over the past two years, industrial conglomerate Honeywell International has spent more than $14 million lobbying in Washington, including on ""international taxation and repatriation."" Many multinational corporations, including those whose executives have come together as part of the Campaign to Fix the Debt, enjoy a benefit that allows them to indefinitely put off paying U.S. taxes on interest income earned overseas. They have lobbied for more than 15 years to preserve the so-called active-financing exemption, and Congress has repeatedly extended it.This year was no exception. The active-financing exemption was one of the corporate tax benefits included in the fiscal cliff deal earlier this week. The exemption for overseas investment income is estimated to cost more than $11 billion over the next two years, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.From 2008 to 2010, Honeywell paid an effective federal tax rate of minus 0.7 percent, according to an analysis from Citizens for Tax Justice and the Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy. A Honeywell spokesman did not respond to questions about corporate tax exemptions.General Electric, also part of the Fix the Debt coalition, has relied extensively on the overseas investment exemption through the years -- a factor that contributed to its famously low federal tax rate in 2010, the subject of a New York Times investigation. The exemption is important enough that G.E. identifies failure to extend the benefit as a ""risk factor"" in its annual securities filings. The company told investors that its tax rate would ""increase significantly"" if the exemption weren't extended by Congress.A spokesman for G.E., Seth Martin, wrote in an e-mail that the company's tax rate was low in 2010 because of losses in its finance wing during the economic crisis, but that rates have since increased. In the company's most recent annual filing, G.E. said its tax rate was minus 11.6 percent in 2009, 7.3 percent in 2010 and 28.5 percent in 2011. Those rates reflect income taxes paid in all countries, not just the United States.Martin said G.E. supports comprehensive tax reform, including lowering corporate tax rates but also closing loopholes, ""even if it means higher taxes for companies like G.E."" He said reforms would encourage domestic economic growth and encourage U.S. multinational companies to invest overseas earnings at home.The chief executives of major banks with international investments, including JPMorgan Chase's Jamie Dimon and Morgan Stanley's James Gorman, publicly pushed for a sensible resolution to the fiscal cliff. In November, Gorman sent an email to employees, urging them to contact members of Congress. ""No issue is more critical right now for the U.S. economy, the global financial markets and the financial well-being of our clients,"" he wrote.Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have lobbied for extensions of overseas tax benefits in recent years. Representatives from both banks did not respond to requests for comment on Friday.Another corporate tax benefit included in the fiscal cliff deal is a provision known as bonus depreciation, which allows companies that invest in costly equipment to account for depreciation expenses much faster than they otherwise could. In other words, companies can deduct more in expenses now, lowering their taxable income.Congress has extended the provision each year since 2008 in an effort to spur business investment during the economic downturn. Bonus depreciation is expected to cost $35 billion this year, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, and those costs are predicted to rise significantly if Congress keeps extending the benefit. Yet a Congressional Research Service report from September found that accelerated depreciation is a ""relatively ineffective tool for stimulating the economy.""Verizon Wireless Communications, another Fix the Debt member, has spent more than $30 million lobbying over the past two years. The company lists bonus depreciation as a lobbying priority, along with taxation on foreign earnings.A spokesman for the Campaign to Fix the Debt, Jon Romano, said the group is not making specific recommendations to the White House and Congress on how to structure a long-term deficit reduction plan. He did not say whether coalition members would be willing to give up corporate tax exemptions, but he said the group believes in ""reining in spending, raising revenues and real entitlement reform.""""They all understand that no deal is going to be perfect and that people are going to have to make sacrifices,"" Romano said. ""They've all said they're willing to do that. Everybody is going to have to give something up to get a debt deal that's good for the country."""

Smaller banks that were concerned that the settlement terms favor larger lenders also opposed the deal, the Journal added.A majority of the 14 servicers have already agreed to the terms of the deal, which would be in jeopardy if it is not completed this weekend, the Journal said."

But who will be joining him? An elbow injury had starting quarterback Christian Ponder listed as ""questionable"" on the Vikings' final injury report before the game. John Clayton of ESPN initially reported that ""the quarterback is expected to play,"" but there was still no confirmation as the Texans and Bengals kicked off the opening Wild Card game on Saturday afternoon. If Ponder were unable to go, little-used, dual-threat quarterback Joe Webb would get the nod. According to Jay Glazer of FOX Sports, the confusion even permeated the Vikings' locker room in the hours before the game. When Judd Zulgad of 1500ESPN heard the reports on Friday, he felt that there may be something more at play here than injury concerns. Is Ponder's elbow really hurting bad enough from a second-quarter hit last Sunday from blitzing safety Morgan Burnett there is legitimate concern about whether he can play in the rematch against Green Bay? Well, what do you think? Could Vikings coach Leslie Frazier just be messing with the Packers? Or will we really see Joe Webb in action? If so, could his ground game cause trouble for the Pack?UPDATE 6:29 p.m. EST: During the third quarter of the Bengals-Texans game, NBC announced that Ponder would be inactive due to his elbow injury.

His 229 rushing yards set the Cotton Bowl record for a quarterback. He made the 11th-ranked Oklahoma Sooners look like a high school team. He dazzled, danced and scrambled in the pocket as if he were playing 7-7 pickup football in the summer, totaling over 500 yards and four touchdowns. The Aggies' 41-13 victory wasn't even that close.Perhaps the legend of Manziel is only in its infancy, but the Heisman Trophy winner -- still just a redshirt freshman -- has already established himself as one of the most exciting college football players ever. Forget, for a moment, the unparalleled numbers and all of the accolades; Manziel is just the type of scintillating talent that you can't stop watching. He is so fast and so smooth that the only comparison is to a video game. Robert Griffin III was like that last season at Baylor, and he was a senior. It's what Manziel did against top-ranked Alabama earlier this season that birthed his legend. While it remains far too early to make a prediction on the remainder of his career, he's the rare young talent who might become the first collegian since Archie Griffin (at Ohio State) to win multiple Heismans. He stands a few shades below 6 feet, so we can talk all we want about how Manziel isn't the classic drop-back passer and how he won't succeed in the NFL. But what would be the point? We can even debate whether or not his pro position will actually be at quarterback, but then again, where's the fun in that?Manziel plays with the type of wondrous, reckless abandonment very few possess. He's 20 years old, is very likely getting better and, potentially, will go down as one of the greatest college football players in history. In 2013, Texas A&M has eight home games and just four road games. Maybe he wins a national title and maybe he doesn't, but Manziel's legacy has already been cemented. Enjoy him and relish him for as long as you can.He is, simply put, Johnny Football.Email me at jordan.schultz@huffingtonpost.com or ask me questions about anything sports-related at @Schultz_Report."

They believe that by withholding her forgiveness, she's retaining toxic emotions and will never come to peace or achieve closure. Which viewpoint is more valid?The Pressure To ForgiveReligious, psychological and societal values endorse the virtue of forgiveness. Victims are confronted with the pressure to forgive those who caused them pain. They are told that forgiveness is an essential ingredient for the healing process. There's a widespread assumption that without forgiveness, victims will never move past their trauma or achieve self-empowered freedom that conquers their sense of victimization. When it comes to the need for victims to forgive, two questions need to be asked: First, do victims really need to forgive to overcome their ordeals? Second, is it fair to expect victims to forgive and exonerate their perpetrators? Carrie Fisher famously said that ""Resentment is the poison you swallow hoping the other person will die."" The implication here is that resentment is detrimental for the victim but doesn't really have an impact on the perpetrator.While we may all agree that a continued and permanent state of bitterness about the past is never a healthy mode of existence, it's fair to question whether forgiveness is the key to escaping a state of negativity or whether acceptance -- without forgiveness -- is enough to move beyond suffering towards peace and achieving resolution.The Upside of AngerWhen victims succumb to the pressure to forgive, they may feel that they're being victimized once again because in a way, forgiveness can negate the agony they endured and their right to be angry. In fact, there are times when anger is a healthy response. Acquiescence is never an appropriate response when your trust and dignity has been violated. When someone humiliates and hurts you, anger serves as a protective mechanism because it signals that something is wrong. Anger tells you that this type of behavior is unacceptable because it's damaging to your self-worth. The absence of anger in a scenario like this leaves you vulnerable to abuse. Anger Is Only One Letter Short Of DangerAbsolving someone you loved deeply and trusted from the devastation they caused you may come at the expense of your integrity. Sacrificing the value of your dignity to let someone off the hook for their intentional betrayal isn't always worth the forgiveness they may desire to lessen their sense of remorse and regret. However, when anger becomes an all-consuming desire to punish the person who hurt you, the consequences can be tragic. The sense of disempowerment is one of the strongest factors that characterizes and contributes to feeling victimized. In order to regain their sense of power, victims sometimes try to assert their power over the aggressor by using some form of retaliation. This is especially true when it involves children who are caught between the hostility of their divorced parents.Poisoning children against a parent is one of the worst ways to punish an ex. Parents should have the maturity to realize that although hurting an ex-spouse may feel good, it's detrimental to and victimizes their children. The love for your children needs to exceed your acrimony for your ex.Eight Constructive Tips For Overcoming Betrayal: 1. Know that it's not your fault. Your marriage may or may not have been in trouble, but having an affair is a volitional act. It violated your trust.2. Acceptance is necessary to move on; you need to acknowledge and come to terms with the unfortunate reality and injustice of your situation.3. You're entitled to withhold your forgiveness from your ex. But you're not entitled to use your children to victimize or punish your ex.4. You can also forgive if it works for you. A bad therapist will push forgiveness. A good one will help you find the best way of coming to terms with the betrayal.5. Although anger is appropriate initially, eventually you must let go of the negativity. You deserve a future free of anger.6. Don't fall apart publicly to show everyone what's been done to you. You're entitled to grieve, but don't become a victim of your victimhood.7. Consider the consequences of your actions. Don't have indiscriminate sex as revenge, or do something you'll regret just to make you feel better.8. It's true: the best revenge is living well."

But, for those of us who are prone to observe the fleeting nature of our lives, owning a dog places you firmly in the present. Call it ""dog time.""",2013-01-04,"Jack Russell Terrier puppy, 2 months old, getting out of a box in front of white background",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cb03026000032007f9400.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My son and I read ""The Emissary"" by Ray Bradbury for his school literature class. In the story, a dog helps a bed-ridden boy grieve both his inability to walk and the death of a beloved teacher. The dog ventures to the outside world, including to the cemetery where the teacher is buried, and returns carrying smells of places the boy cannot visit. For me, Bradbury's story, like the 1952 French war film Forbidden Games (Jeux interdits), reinforced the dog's role in facing tragedy and mortality.For some of us, the tragedies of 2012 fed into a lifetime contemplating the passage of time and mortality. What makes some of us more prone to morbid thoughts? Is it temperament? Parenting? Early exposure to trauma or loss? A melancholic disposition that looks at the fleeting beauty of childhood and the impermanence of the moment through a nostalgic lens? Despite being a cheerful and smiley person, since as long as I can remember, I drift off into anxiety that it all must end. As a child, I lay in my bed at night trying to wrap my mind around non-existence. I felt the angst that we try to forget as we embrace the pleasures and challenges of daily living. I have found a balm that helps me keep my existential angst at bay: Dogs. This post is for those on the fence about whether to adopt a dog, whether for themselves or their child. I say, ""Go for it!"" I want to share my appreciation of how ""dog time"" can offer a form of ""puppy Prozac.""It turns out that a university in Canada also understands this solution, and who is more ridden with existential angst than college students? The Canadian National Post reported that students at Dalhousie University in Halifax found solace from the pressure of finals in a ""puppy room."" The Therapeutic Paws of Canada, an organization that typically brings the loving animals to hospitals and nursing homes, now comes to university campuses.My teenage daughter considers this a great approach to stress. There is no better cure for her adolescent blues than our dog, Nala, who will lick her tears away. If her father and I fail to understand her plight, Nala remains loyal and true. Dogs provide a secure antidote to human unpredictability. I originally got Nala in recognition of how my own childhood dog, Tiffy, comforted me. Despite the fact that Tiffy chewed up the orthodontic retainers of friends who mistakenly placed them on counters, routinely scooped my mother's small clock from her psychoanalytic office into his slobbering mouth, carried it to the kitchen and sat on it until she bribed him off the required time-keeper with a piece of meat, or, on occasion, bit us (yes, sad but true), the dog made us happy.I am not claiming that owning a dog will teach your child something noble, like responsibility, although perhaps it will. Most dog owners who are also parents realize that children quickly forget their promises to walk the wished-for dog. But, for those of us who are prone to observe the fleeting nature of our lives -- or, to be less melodramatic, for parents watching children grow or simply for Botox-resisting adults noticing skin sag -- the passage of time can be hard to take. Owning a dog places you firmly in the present. Call it ""dog time.""There's the regularity of canine care: walking, feeding and throwing a toy to chase. Attending to the dog's needs forces even the most angst-ridden of us to act in the moment. My husband, a reluctant pet owner, theoretically does not believe in the domestication of animals. However, in the two years that Nala has lived with us, he has discovered the unexpected pleasure of dog walks. Although he may be loath to put on a coat and shoes late at night for that last walk of the day, once he and Nala are outside, he always enjoys the fresh air. Much as Jean Jacques Rousseau cherished his solitary walks and reveries, dog walks bring solace and contemplation. On spring mornings, summer evenings, fall afternoons and snowy winter days, Nala cherishes the leaves, squirrels, birds and odors and I discover parts of Central Park I previously neglected.We leash-holding humans discover an Arcadian contentment during ""dog-time."" Out in rain, snow, sleet and hurricane, we greet one another and comprise a community of diverse ages and backgrounds, pulled together by the dogs' fondness for the other's scent. Then, there's the affirmation. Dogs let their owners know that we are terrific. Nala sleeps beside our bed. When everyone in our family heads to bed, Nala follows us and curls into a ball on the pillow we've laid out for her. Each morning, Nala is overjoyed to see us. While I sit at my computer, she tucks herself under my chair by my feet. During a walk, if I temporarily hand over her leash over to another for a few moments, Nala darts towards me upon my return. What a reunion! ""Dog-time"" involves a short memory span and holds no grudges. While human babies display this joy during their early years, they grow up, establish a sense of object permanence and eventually (hopefully), a core of independence so that a brief separation no longer yields the same delight in reunion it once did. Nala, on the other hand, never grows beyond her infantile joy of discovery. She provides me with wags, licks and recognition as if the world revolved around me. And yes, I am aware that Nala's world does in fact revolve around me because I feed, care for and walk her. So perhaps I am merely confessing the pleasure of being needed. This is not to be undervalued as one's children age.Did I mention that I bought the dog ""for the kids?"" In an age of too much homework, test prep and video games, the dog encourages kids to leave behind the papers and screens. Nala can singularly lure my son to leave his precious Wii game. He and the dog run around our apartment fully absorbed in the pleasure of the chase. My daughter loves to curl up with Nala on her lap (Nala is a small dog), pet her and release the pressures of the day. If she cannot control her parents, then our treat-loving dog will eagerly comply with her commands for tricks. The physicality, play and love they have with the dog stops the clock that ticks away with intensity for children of the 21st century.Perhaps it's a bit far-fetched to connect thoughts of mortality to puppies, but I want to acknowledge the benefits of ""dog time."" The dog's needs, joy, and inability to speak transport us to a different register and calm those of us overly sensitive to the passage of human time.Of course, as some kids cannot resist pointing out, a dog year ""equals"" seven human years. ""Dog time"" may slow down our intense lives but, in a different sense, ""dog time"" moves faster than human time. I remember vividly my grief when Tiffy, died at the old age of 14, even though I was an adult by then. Sometimes, I do think about Nala's short life expectancy, but I quickly put such thoughts aside to rub her belly. Inasmuch as the goodbye to a beloved pet is heartbreaking, it, too, can be a good lesson in dealing with existential angst and mortality."

Keep a photo of your skinnier self on-hand. (Or, conversely, as Elizabeth Taylor preferred -- an averting heavier photo.)But a new pair of studies from Tilburg University in the Netherlands revealed that for those who want to lose weight, taping up a photo of a skinny model didn't provide any extra motivation. Researchers conducted two separate week-long experiments, using women who wanted to lose weight. In the first study, the participants were given food journals in which they were required to write down their daily food intake. On the front of the journals, the researchers had affixed either a photo of a fashion model or, as a control, a neutral logo. In the second study, women were given either the control image or the same photo, though digitally altered to depict the model as of average weight. They found that the fashion model failed against the logo -- and that it also underperformed when compared to the ""normal-looking"" photo. ""Female participants who were exposed to the thin model perceived their dieting goals as less attainable, engaged in more goal-inconsistent behavior (i.e., consuming unhealthy snacks), and had less success losing weight,"" the researchers wrote. In fact, those who saw the skinny model each time they recorded their food actually gained weight because the task at hand -- rendering themselves fashion model skinny -- felt so impossible, it derailed their diet efforts, reported NPR. The results are surprising in an increasing atmosphere, at least on the Internet, of what is often called ""thinspiration"" or ""thinspo"" for short. HuffPost's Carolyn Gregoire reported on the phenomenon last year:The poster girl for thinspo bloggers is Cassie, the starry-eyed, anorexic pill-popper of the British teen television drama Skins, whose image pops up all over the thinspo blogosphere. The models most frequently featured are Karlie Kloss and Kate Moss. An iconic black-and-white photograph of Kate in an oversized T-shirt that reads ""I Beat Obesity"" is a recurring theme, perfectly capturing the ethos of the thinspo community.Of course, the disordered eating habits of ""thinspo"" diarists are a far cry from those who are interested in losing weight healthfully with dietary and exercise changes. Among the many things that differentiate these populations is the idea of attainability: model photos didn't work for the study's subjects because they didn't think it was possible to look like someone with an entirely different body composition, while the ""thinspo"" community believes that they can, through sheer force of will, command their bodies to take on a certain appearance. However, using a different person's image as inspiration is certainly a shared -- and perhaps disordered in its own right -- behavior. That it doesn't work -- and that it is counterproductive to the goal of a healthy lifestyle -- is news for everyone."

Google was a number before 1998. And YouTube wasn't even around before 2000. But the onslaught of social media and the impact we see in everything from commerce to relationship has redefined our lives. A friend is no longer someone who rides with you on their bike down the street, they're the one who ""liked"" your photo.A friend isn't always someone who looks you in the eye with a look of compassion, but rather someone who posts something positive on your wall for all to see. Today, a friend doesn't have to write a letter or have a meal; they just have to invite you to an online event to make you feel special. As so many of us are learning how to use the new tools from the Internet revolution, there are good ways to connect -- and things missing. For example, I've asked several teenagers what the #1 issue is at their school, and without exception, they always come back to some form of loneliness. ""I feel all alone, and I don't know why,"" a quarterback from a southeast high school told me. ""If you feel lonely,"" I replied, ""then what do you think everyone else in the school feels?"" Here is one of the most high-profile students in a particular school. He has thousands of Facebook followers, a popular Instagram account and everyone wants a shot at his cell phone number, yet in the midst of it all, he feels all alone?I'm afraid with the illusion of friendship being highlighted on so many social media platforms, we're actually redefining what ""friendship"" really means. To learn how to have compassion for one another apart from a machine is something of the past. To learn how to rejoice with someone in person is becoming a lost art. I see students every single week in different places around the world who are suffering from a lack of ""know how."" It's not that they don't want real friends; they just don't know how to relate anymore. Ask a student how his or her day was, and they'll fumble through an explanation. Text a student a question, and you might get 10 responses in a row. I'm not advocating we do away with online social media, but I do think there are ways we can help coach students to have REAL friendships. After all, I believe humanity needs to be able to be friends outside of a social media world where there is no real threat for rejection. We need to teach our kids how to deal with people in situations where you have to look someone in the eye and read what they're thinking and what motivates them. Without a few people who grew up in the world without social media, I'm afraid for this generation growing up without real friends, because loneliness is a dark, shadowy pit that keeps people from exploring the world and others who live in it."

Whether celebrating the Super Bowl in New Orleans, retracing the Hobbit's footsteps in New Zealand or taking in the history and hospitality of that southern gem called Charleston, there's plenty happening in 2013 to put these locales at the top of the list.For those who find satisfaction in getting a great deal, Orbitz dishes some value destinations that won't disappoint. This year, sun-seekers will reap the most reward with picks from the Southwest to the Caribbean. Orlando continues to reign as a go-to family and value destination in 2013 thanks to the large hotel inventory with prices for all budgets, and the Dominican Republic showcases some of the best prices in the Caribbean and adds more flights to remote areas. Phoenix also makes it into the mix thanks to average hotel rates as low as $100 a night and affordable excursions to towns like nearby Tucson, host to many arts and culture events throughout the year.And who doesn't love a good comeback story? On the heels of Hurricane Sandy, Orbitz proclaims Atlantic City will be the comeback kid of 2013. Avoiding any major permanent storm damage, this resort town is very much up and running and with new hotels such as Revel, designer shopping, world-class restaurants and A-list entertainment like Lady Gaga, Kanye West and Beyonce, Atlantic City has become much more than just a gaming destination.Lastly, in this age of technology, travel trends just as often point to how travelers are booking their vacations as much as they are about where they are going. Orbitz makes three final keen predictions for the coming year: 1) bookings via mobile devices will continue to explode, including buying even international packages on smartphones and tablets, 2) social media-savvy consumers will continue to cash in on even more insider deals from their favorite travel companies and 3) expect an uptick in international travel with particularly good deals across the pond in England and Ireland.Reprinted from the Orbitz Blog: Orbitz 2013 Travel Forecast"
