Creator, Mantra Movement",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meditation_us_5b9da7c6e4b03a1dcc8ae88d,"Placing your focus on a mantra is a meditative technique that is easy to incorporate into your daily routine. It can be used wherever and whenever you need it, just as soon as a negative feeling bubbles up.",2013-11-16,2013-11-12-MantraMovementstickersandmagnetsflowers.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-11-12-MantraMovementstickersandmagnetsflowers-thumb.JPG,"Daily stresses, as trivial as being stuck in traffic, were getting the best of me. Some days felt like a series of negative emotions: impatience, irritability, and anxiety. Living like this was exhausting and affecting my loved ones. I knew that I would benefit from meditation, but I couldn't always make time for the seated, silent practice. Mantras became my ""Meditation On The Go.""A mantra is an instrument of the mind. It is a powerful and positive word, capable of creating transformation. Mantra meditation prevents destructive emotions from escalating, while making room for positive emotions like peace, joy, and kindness. Placing your focus on a mantra is a meditative technique that is easy to incorporate into your daily routine. It can be used wherever and whenever you need it, just as soon as a negative feeling bubbles up: while driving during rush hour, negotiating nap time with a preschooler, or even in the middle of a conversation. Here's how it works:1. Without judgment, identify the negative emotion. For example, ""impatient.""Notice when when you first start experiencing a negative feeling. Perhaps you notice the physiological signs: shortness of breath, tense shoulders, chest pressure, a furrowed brow, sweat, or even an upset stomach. Stress and anxiety manifest themselves in different ways, in different people. Ask yourself, where is it hurting?Look around. What is happening in your environment that brought on this feeling? Are you running late, yet again, and that is causing you to feel frustration, guilt, or impatience towards the other drivers around you? Get to know yourself and your environmental triggers. Pinpoint why it is hurting. Name the feeling. When you observe your thoughts, as just thoughts, you are able to detach yourself from the negative emotion. You become an onlooker. You are not impatient. The feeling itself is impatient, and you are separate from it.Being a non-judgmental witness allows you to grow self-compassion. Destructive emotions happen, human brains are just wired that way. When you respond to these feelings with loving-kindness and understanding, you cultivate your own well-being. Consider a mother's unconditional love for her child. Picture her comforting him and wishing that he be free from suffering. In a self-compassion practice, you and your thoughts are both the mother and the child. Allow yourself to soothe yourself, to be nurtured. 2. Choose the opposite, or positive, emotion as your mantra. In following the above example, you would choose ""patient.""Use any word or sound that inspires you or quiets your mind. Positive words have powerful connotations. Compassion, mindfulness, gratitude, content, patient, authentic, kindness, community, calm, and strength are the mantras that I use regularly. I choose based on what I need most that day. Just as the intention you set at the start of your yoga class, the more you come back to that intention, and check in on it throughout your practice, the more beneficial. Seal it in.Mantras are effective because they are fast, easy to remember, and they are not statements of belief. Your conscious mind is more receptive to a single positive word than it is to an ""I am..."" affirmation. For example, ""I am calm and relaxed in this moment,"" may be immediately followed with feelings of judgment or disbelief, especially when you are in the midst of an anxious moment. ""Calm"" is strong enough to stand alone.3. Deep breath.  Take a huge inhale, hold it in, exhale. Say the word in your mind. ""Patient."" Deep breath. ""Patient."" Deep breath. Repeat if needed.Breath is essential to well-being. It is both automatic, meaning that we can voluntarily take a breath or hold our breath, and autonomic, meaning that our body is ultimately in control of this function and it happens naturally on it's own. Short, shallow breathing is a symptom of stress. It heightens your fight-or-flight response, sending a signal to your brain that you are in danger. When we choose to take deep, slow, deliberate breaths, it delivers a message to the brain that all is well. Your relaxation response is activated, slowing your heart rate back down, decreasing your blood pressure, and relaxing your muscles. Recent studies in neuroscience show us that practiced positive thinking actually alters the structure and function of the brain. Thanks to neuroplasiticy, we can change our moods through regular mental training. In a matter of weeks, I found that I required fewer mantras and deep breaths to get through the day stress-free. I felt more emotional stability, patience, and energy. Positive thinking became a habit. The compassion I was busy cultivating in my own self had manifested in other relationships as well. I had grown a greater capacity for love, and I am a better mom, wife, sister, friend and community member for it. Negative emotions do still arise in me from time to time, as it is part of the human experience, but now I have a strategy for rising above those emotions, even on the busiest of days."

How could a race billed as ""probably the toughest event on the planet"" not be challenging?But after a 28-year-old participant died during an April 2013 Tough Mudder, witnesses and critics questioned the organization's commitment to safety.Now, a new study aims to point out just how many injuries are occurring at these races -- and how unique the injuries are. ""The volume and severity of injuries in the Tough Mudder race we studied was unusually high, possibly leading to some permanent disabilities,"" lead study author Marna Rayl Greenberg, DO MPH, said in a statement. ""The 1.5 million people who are predicted to enter obstacle races like this in the next year should be well aware of the risks they are taking.""The study, published in Annals of Emergency Medicine, describes five patients injured at a two-day event who were treated at a local emergency department in Pennsylvania. There were 33 others who were injured and treated at the same hospital but were not included in the study.One of the patients had burn marks and heart inflammation after receiving 13 electrical shocks. Another had fainted after multiple electrical shocks to the head. A third was unable to move his right side after seizure-like activity and was still experiencing problems with his right leg six months later. The fourth patient had face and head injuries from being struck by electrical cords, and the fifth was admitted to the hospital with rhabdomyolsis (in headlines these days for its association with CrossFit) and dehydration.In West Virginia, a local hospital had to turn patients away after the injured participants from a Tough Mudder in the area overloaded its resources, CBS Baltimore reported.Unlike with marathons, where the training enhances race-day performance and preparedness, obstacle races are nearly impossible to train for, the study authors write. There's little one can do to ""prevent injury in an event in which obstacles include having to jump off a 9-foot height or run through a ﬁeld of electrical wires (while the participant is wet and hot),"" they write. ""Training might not have prevented many of the injuries that occurred in this event.""CORRECTION: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the location of the hospital that had to turn injured patients away due to overloading of resources from a Tough Mudder event. The correct location of the hospital is West Virginia."

""Many people know about some of the people who integrated schools in the South in the 1950s and '60s. What they don't know is who tried first and failed, was blocked, was martyred.""He said he hopes Kennard's story will inspire children, ""a story that gives us permission to act, to be courageous.""After serving in the Army in the Korean War, Kennard attended the University of Chicago, working toward a degree in political science.His stepfather died, and he returned to Mississippi to help his mother run their farm outside Hattiesburg, Miss.Desiring to finish his degree, he repeatedly tried to enroll at the all-white Mississippi Southern College (now the University of Southern Mississippi). When he showed up on campus to enroll in 1959, two constables arrested him on charges of illegal possession of alcohol. (Mississippi Sovereignty Commission records show the alcohol was planted in his car.)Despite being fined $600 on the bogus charge, Kennard remained dedicated to attending Southern and talked of taking his case to federal court.On Sept. 25, 1960, a constable arrested Kennard, claiming he masterminded the theft of $25 in chicken feed.A judge sentenced Kennard to the maximum seven years in prison. The admitted thief? He walked free and continued to work at the same job.At the state prison in Parchman, Kennard picked cotton on the sunup to sundown gang, and one guard especially abused him. He became ill, but medical treatment came slowly. By the time doctors had diagnosed him, he was dying of cancer.At the request of Medgar Evers and others, then-Gov. Ross Barnett released Kennard in January 1963, and Kennard expressed no bitterness, declaring, ""I love Mississippi.""In his last days, shriveling from cancer in a Chicago hospital, he declared, ""What happened to me isn't as bad as what happened to the guard [that abused him], because this system has turned him into a beast, and it will turn his children into beasts.""Kennard died on July 4, 1963--the anniversary of the document that had promised ""all men are created equal.""In 2005, the man charged with stealing chicken feed told The Clarion-Ledger that Kennard had actually done nothing wrong.History teacher Barry Bradford and his students teamed up with Steve Drizin, the Director of the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern University's School of Law, LaKeisha Bryant, the president of the Afro-American Student Association at the University of Southern Mississippi, and civil rights activists Joyce Ladner and Raylawni Branch, and pushed for Kennard's exoneration.On May 16, 2006, Circuit Judge Bob Helfrich threw out Kennard's conviction.""It is a right-wrong issue,"" he said. ""To correct that wrong I'm compelled to do the right thing and declare Mr. Kennard innocent.""Kennard's life moved Shetterly.""How he refused bitterness, how deep his courage ran, one cannot but marvel at him,"" the artist said. ""Knowing a story like that of Clyde Kennard allows each of us to be a better person.""There is no better teacher than courage. Clyde Kennard is a great teacher."" Jerry Mitchell is an investigative reporter for The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Miss.

(AP Photo/Oskar Garcia)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafbe363c000032000b9ded.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Wasting no time within days of signing a marriage equality bill into law, Hawaii Governor Neil Abercrombie made a bid on Friday for gay and lesbian couples across the U.S. mainland to travel to the Aloha State to tie the knot, keenly aware of the boon same-sex marriage could be for his state’s tourism industry.“For those listening in, Hawaii welcomes you!” Abercrombie exclaimed in an interview with me on SiriusXM Progress, speaking directly to gay and lesbian listeners. “There are several states where you can get married. But I think I can say without fear of contradiction, ‘Paradise awaits.’ We’ll be happy to welcome you. And if you do get married in another state, think about honeymooning in Hawaii. “Abercrombie on Hawaii's marriage equality victory: Abercrombie, who spearheaded the marriage equality bill, calling a special session for the vote, said he was proud of Hawaii’s role as a leader on the issue. In 1993 Hawaii’s Supreme Court was the first to rule that that denying marriage to same-sex couples violated their constitutional rights, sending a gay marriage case back to a trial court for review. A backlash ensued, leading to many state bans on gay marriage — including in Hawaii — and to the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the federal law which was stuck down by the U.S. Supreme Court last June.“Part of the sense of Aloha that we try to live by is the sense that our diversity should define us, not divide us,” he said. “Persevere in extending our humanity to one another.”Before resigning in 2010 to run for governor, Abercrombie represented Hawaii’s first district in the U.S House of Representatives for almost 20 years. He criticized Republicans in the House, where Speaker John Boehner says he will not bring the Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) up for a vote after it passed the Senate two weeks ago.Abercrombie on ENDA: “I don’t quite understand this,” Abercrombie said about the bill which would ban employment based on sexual orientation and gender identity. “If you want to just put it in strictly philosophical terms -- political philosophy -- the most conservative`position is that people should be hired on the basis of their contribution and their merit. What difference does it make what you’re sexual orientation is? Over time it’s become clear the Republican Party… [is] not going to be the party of any of those who support civil rights for everyone.”Abercrombie also weighed in on openly lesbian Hawaii State Representative Jo Jordan, who voted against the marriage equality bill, becoming the first openly gay or lesbian legislator in the U.S. to vote against gay marriage. Abercrombie had appointed the Democrat to fill a vacated seat in 2011. She has since been elected in her district, which overwhelmingly supports marriage equality, as does Jordan herself. She has said she voted against the bill because she didn’t believe the religious exemptions were strong enough.Abercrombie on Jordan's anti-gay marriage vote: “She was a lonely voice in this,"" Abercrombie said, noting that he didn't appoint her believing she would be in ""lockstep"" with his positions. “I understand it. I disagree with her. She had her reservations about [the bill] sufficient to cause her to vote no. And I'm going to take her at her word. My job now is not to seek retribution or go over the validity of what the motivation was for people’s votes, but to work with them all."""

To no one’s surprise, they didn’t get it. As of 2012, an estimated 4.7% of hourly workers are paid at or below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. According to several groups, low- and minimum-wage workers are growing faster than any other group of earners.Meanwhile, profits at many of the corporations that employ the most minimum-wage workers have risen. McDonald’s, Walmart and Target together employ several million Americans. While these companies’ profits have grown in recent years, most of their workers continue to earn low or minimum wages. 24/7 Wall St. identified the 10 companies that employ the most low- and minimum wage workers.Click here to see the Ten Companies Paying Americans the Least Companies that pay employees poorly fall into one of three industries: retailers such as Walmart and Sears, restaurant chains such as McDonald’s and Yum! Brands, and grocery stores such as Kroger. These industries are customer-facing and rely on a fleet low- and minimum-wage workers to take orders, stock clothing and goods and wait tables. “The service sector across the board — the retail and restaurant industries — those are the core of the low-wage labor market,” explained Jack Temple, policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project (NELP).To reinforce the argument that the low wages these companies are paying are unfair, Temple points to the large compensations most of the chief executive officers at these companies receive. CEOs at nine of these 10 companies are paid more than $10 million annually, while Michael Duke and Howard Schultz, CEOs of Walmart and Starbucks, each receive more than $20 million per year.Perhaps a fairer measure that may indicate whether a company can afford to increase its employees’ wages is the profitability of these companies. Net income in all but one of these companies has increased over the past five fiscal years. Kroger’s net income more than tripled since fiscal year 2008 to nearly $1.4 billion. Sears’ net income, on the other hand, has declined significantly during that time. The company recorded a net loss of $930 million this year.Temple explained: “Low-wage companies have choices. They can continue making a lot of profits, and can continue paying their CEOs an incredible amount of money by paying low wages to their employees. But they have the resources to operate profitably and pay high wages as well.”Based on the methodology used by the National Employment Law Project in its 2012 report “Big Business, Corporate Profits, and the Minimum Wage,” 24/7 Wall St. identified the 10 companies in industries that are primarily low-wage employers. Based on annual reports and proxy filings, we also reviewed the total size of the companies’ workforces, the recent performance of the corporations in terms of revenue and profit, and the highest executive pay at these companies. Included in our analysis were total U.S. employee figures, which we estimated when the figures were not provided by the company. In keeping with the NELP methodology, all employee figures represent systemwide employment, including employees of franchisees. To avoid double-counting low-wage workers, Starbucks is an exception, as many other low-wage employers are Starbucks licensees.These are the companies paying Americans the least:"

Not only do fewer than half of patrons, on average, notice the calorie counts on menus, those counts also didn't seem to have any impact on what they ordered and how often they frequented the restaurant, New York University Langone Medical Center researchers found. They presented their findings at the annual meeting of the Obesity Society. Researchers looked at the lunch and dinner receipts from more than 2,000 patrons of Burger King and McDonald's restaurants in Philadelphia before and after the city's calorie labeling law went into effect in February 2010; these patrons were also asked if they noticed the calorie counts on the menus, whether that influenced their purchasing decisions, and how often they'd already had fast food from a big chain that week. Random phone surveys were also conducted with residents of the city, which asked if residents ate fast food from any big chains in the last three months, and the frequency with which they ate it. Less than half of patrons who visited the Burger King and McDonald's restaurants noticed the calorie labeling -- 49 percent at Burger King, and 34 percent at McDonald's, researchers found. Plus, there didn't seem to be a difference in the number of times people ate at the restaurants from before and after the labeling law went into effect -- people ate fast food about five times a week -- nor was there a decrease in visits to fast food restaurants, post-labeling law. (Researchers were able to find this by comparing their data with survey responses from customers of similar demographics at McDonald's and Burger King in Baltimore, which does not have mandatory calorie labeling at fast food restaurants.) ""What we're seeing is that many consumers, particularly vulnerable groups, do not report noticing calorie labeling information and even fewer report using labeling to purchase fewer calories,"" study researcher Dr. Brian Elbel, an assistant professor of Population Health and Health Policy at the NYU School of Medicine, said in a statement. ""After labeling began in Philadelphia, about 10 percent of the respondents in our study said that calorie labels at fast-food chains resulted in them choosing fewer calories.""The findings are similar to past research on the impact (or lack thereof) of menu labeling laws. HuffPost's Meredith Melnick previously reported on research showing that customers notice calorie labels, but they don't purchase fewer calories; another study showed that New York City residents actually purchased more calories after mandatory labeling went into effect in the city. However, a study in teens showed that they were less likely to buy a full-calorie drink if they saw the calorie counts for drinks posted near a beverage case. The 2010 health care law mandated menu calorie counts for restaurant chains, but the implementation and rules for such are still not set in stone, the Associated Press reported; proposed rules would mandate the labels for restaurant chains with 20 or more locations.

Look at that torta. Tell me that is not a sandwich you immediately want to stuff into your mouth until it's gone (unless you are vegetarian, and if so, I GOT YOU COVERED).A torta is a broad class of Mexican sandwich that is usually offered with many different choices of filling. According to Daniel Maurer over at Grubstreet, ""A torta should weigh roughly the amount of Infinite Jest (paperback is fine), and you should be completely covered in it after just a few bites."" Tortas are so huge and messy that you really shouldn't eat them in the company of those who would be scandalized by you licking your fingers (and hands and possibly arms) while you eat.The photo specimen seems to have milanesa (meat, usually beef, pounded thin, breaded, and fried), salchichas (this supposedly translates into ""sausage""... it's hot dogs, y'all), griddled ham, more ham, tomatoes, avocado, refried beans, lettuce, jalapeno, and what could be cheese. I'd also slap my sister* if it didn't have mayo on it. In case you weren't keeping count, that's all of the good things stacked between two halves of a roll** that are gloriously toasted and just substantial enough to mostly hold your sandwich together until you're almost done, but not so substantial you can't bite through it cleanly. The meats vary from sandwich to sandwich, but the condiments pretty much stay the same. Before you eat, as if all that weren't enough, you slather that sumbitch with freshly-made salsas.How does all this taste together? It's sweet-salty thanks to the meat, but not too salty thanks to the fresh toppings; greasy enough to be foodgasmically-indulgent without being a gut-bomb; spicy, but not set-your-mouth-aflame spicy. There's nothing froo-froo or questionably likable on the torta (unless, again, the meat thing gets in the way-still got you covered, read on). It has basic sandwich ingredients, but those ingredients are good quality and put together in the best possible way. And the meat? Isn't any limp ol' deli cut that's been sitting around in plastic wrap for a month. No ma'am-or-sir, that meat was very probably cooked by a person who works in that restaurant. (Okay, so they don't make the hot dogs from scratch, but you get real steak instead of Cryovac roast beef loaf. If you're very very lucky, you get carnitas.)And you get refried beans directly on your sandwich. I don't know who came up with this idea, but that person should have his or her own holiday. A holiday on which we all get free tortas.Don't eat meat? My food guru J. Kenji López-Alt over at Serious Eats has you covered with not one, but two vegan torta recipes that almost any respectable food-lover would love to chow down on, vegan or not. Once you get the basics down with tortas, though, you can add all kinds of fillings to make the vegetarian sandwich of your dreams. It's vegan! No, really! (photo by J. Kenji Lopez-Alt)This giant, messy, stuffed-with-home-cooked-goodness sandwich tops my ""Best Sandwich"" list by a lot. What about you? Are you a torta fan?
