All four men are being held in the Hennepin County Jail without bail on suspicion of assault, according to online jail records.None of the five demonstrators wounded in Monday's shooting received life-threatening injuries, police said.Meanwhile, dozens of people gathered at a north Minneapolis church on Wednesday for the funeral of Clark.The Shiloh Temple International Ministries church is about a mile from the police station where protesters have gathered since Clark's shooting.Some people entering the church wore white T-shirts with ""I matter"" on the front or T-shirts with Clark's photo on them, while others were dressed formally. Most bowed their heads as they walked through the glass doors, and two women collapsed in tears.""I've been to too many funerals and I'm tired of it,"" said mourner Sheryllynn Wagner to reporters outside the church.Questions have been raised whether Clark was handcuffed when he was shot, which police have denied. Clark died the next day from a gunshot wound to the head. The officers involved are on leave.Clark was shot at a time of heightened debate in the United States over police use of lethal force, especially against black people. Over the past year, protests against killings of unarmed black men and women - some videotaped with phones or police cameras - have rocked a number of U.S. cities.In Chicago, a white police officer was charged on Tuesday with murdering a black teenager, hours before authorities released a graphic video showing the man walking away from officers as he is shot 16 times.The Minneapolis Urban League on Tuesday joined the Clark family in urging no demonstrations on Wednesday and for the police station vigil to end to restore order to the neighborhood.SUSPECTS' FACEBOOK PAGES SHOW GUNSMasked men opened fire on demonstrators participating in that vigil on Monday, a Black Lives Matter Minneapolis official said. Attempts by Reuters to reach family members of the four men arrested in that case were not successful.Scarsella lives in St. Paul and grew up in Lakeville, Minnesota, according to his Facebook page, where his cover photo is the one-starred ""Bonnie Blue"" flag often associated with the Confederacy. One of his Facebook photo albums is titled ""shooting"" and shows someone holding a small pistol at a shooting range.Gustavsson lives in Hermantown, Minnesota, and is from Hibbing, Minnesota, according to a Facebook page that became inaccessible on Wednesday afternoon. The page included a profile picture of him wearing a camouflage jacket and holding a rifle.Activists have vowed to continue protests over Clark's killing and called again for the release of video related to his shooting.Authorities have said there was no video of the shooting from police dashboard or body cameras, but investigators are reviewing video from business and security cameras in the area, as well as witnesses' cellphones.A police union representative has said Clark grabbed one officer's gun, although the weapon remained in its holster.According to authorities, the police officers responded to a request for assistance from paramedics who reported that someone was interfering as they tried to help an assault victim. They said Clark was a suspect in the assault and had an altercation with the officers before one of them shot him.(Additional reporting by Ben Klayman in Detroit, Brendan O'Brien in Milwaukee and Melissa Fares in New York; Editing by Andrew Hay and Cynthia Osterman)"
3,BUSINESS,How Exxon Mobil And Koch Brothers Created A Culture Of Climate Doubt,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/exxon-mobil-climate-doubt_us_5654d16de4b0d4093a599530,A new study finds that groups funded by the energy industry heavyweights use similar messages.,2015-11-25,"Emissions rise from the Northern Indiana Public Service Co. (NIPSCO) Bailly generating station on the shore of Lake Michigan at dusk in Chesterton, Indiana, U.S., on Wednesday, Oct. 7, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/565502f41700004b00e1a819.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the biggest studies to examine how climate change became controversial points to the unified dialogue coming out of the hundreds of individuals and organizations funded by energy heavyweights Exxon Mobil Corp. and the Koch brothers.The study, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, reviewed 20 years of data starting in 1993 to show that climate change-denying groups and individuals who received money from Exxon Mobil and the Koch brothers began to unify their messages in 2007, amplifying supposed uncertainty surrounding the issue. “They were writing things that were different from the contrarian organizations that did not receive corporate funding,” Yale University sociologist and lead study author Justin Farrell said. “Over time, it brought them into a more cohesive social movement and aligned their messages.”The study isn't the first to note the influence Big Oil's campaigns have on people's perceptions of climate change, but it's the first to look at such a large data set, Farrell said. Using computer analytics, the study looked at 4,556 individuals -- including board members, politicians and researchers -- with ties to 164 organizations -- including think tanks, foundations and lobbying firms. Researchers examined everything the individuals wrote about climate change from 1993 to 2013 -- a total of more than 40,700 texts. Those who received industry funding stood out in an alarming way. ""Two main findings emerge,"" the study notes. ""First, that organizations with corporate funding were more likely to have written and disseminated texts meant to polarize the climate change issue. Second, and more importantly, that corporate funding influences the actual thematic content of these polarization efforts, and the discursive prevalence of that thematic content over time.""For example, from 2007 to 2013, those who received funding increased their discussion of the issue of energy production, the positive benefits of CO2 and questions over whether climate change is a long-term cycle. Polarizing issues that way, the study notes, ""is an effective strategy for creating controversy and delaying policy progress.""The study comes during a trying time for Exxon Mobil (and for the entire U.S. oil and coal industry.) Two weeks ago, New York state announced an investigation into whether Exxon Mobil misled investors and the public about the effects and financial implications of climate change.Also on HuffPost: "
4,MEDIA,Trump Campaign Restricts Reporters Covering What Happens Off Stage,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-campaign-journalists-restricted_us_5655c50be4b08e945fea918f,"Rules come amid increasing tensions, and even violence, at rallies.",2015-11-25,Donald Trump's campaign has aggressively restricted journalists' movements at events. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_7_137_3593_2139%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Donald Trump's campaign severely restricted journalists' movements Tuesday night in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, by keeping them in a press pen -- even apparently after the event ended -- and requiring them to have an escort when going to the bathroom.NBC News reporter Katy Tur tweeted that members of the media were told they couldn't leave the designated press area, often described as a pen, ""while Trump is in the room."" She added that this restriction is ""now official policy that the secret service is enforcing."" The Secret Service began providing Trump and fellow Republican candidate Dr. Ben Carson with protection earlier this month at their request and following approval from the Department of Homeland Security. No other candidates have such protection, except Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, who as a former first lady has Secret Service protection for life. But the Trump campaign has been particularly aggressive in calling on the Secret Service -- or citing the agency's concerns -- to enforce press restrictions. Last week, Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski threatened to ""blacklist"" CNN reporter Noah Gray for leaving the pen to cover a protester at a Massachusetts rally. Though the Trump campaign claimed it reacted in response to Secret Service concerns about reporters moving into the crowd, an agent told Gray that wasn't the case. What happens off stage at Trump events is particularly newsworthy these days as events grow increasingly tense and, at times, violent. On Saturday in Birmingham, Alabama, several white supporters apparently punched and kicked a Black Lives Matter activist who interrupted a rally, a violent response Trump condoned the next morning on Fox News. Representatives from five networks -- ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox and CNN -- discussed their concerns about the Trump campaign restrictions on a Monday conference call, but did not present the campaign with any specific access requests. The enforcement of restrictions at events has been inconsistent, according to one reporter who is not authorized to speak on the record. On Monday, a Secret Service agent kept reporters in the ""pen"" in Columbus, Ohio, the reporter said, but it was a Trump campaign staffer enforcing the restriction on Tuesday night in Myrtle Beach. A Secret Service spokesman did not specifically address the restrictions at the Trump rallies, but broadly described the agency's role at campaign events in a statement to The Huffington Post. ""It is not a function of the Secret Service to prevent or limit the press from conducting interviews at events attended by our protectees,"" he said. The spokesman continued:However, those with press credentials are always segregated from the general public for logistical and security reasons. Members of the press are free to attend events as general public with the same access as general public. It is their choice as to whether they will attend as part of the media pool.The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. Other campaigns have faced scrutiny over access this cycle, including the Clinton team after aides corralled reporters during a July 4 parade. Also, there may be some growing pains when Secret Service gets involved given that events become more complicated logistically. The agency needs to conduct security sweeps hours beforehand, screen journalists and members of the public, and possibly cordon off certain areas. But the Trump campaign's recent restrictions inside rallies follow its unusual tendency to prevent some reporters from attending events altogether. On Thursday, the campaign barred a BuzzFeed reporter from attending an Iowa event, even though he'd already gone through Secret Service screening. The campaign wouldn't let the reporter enter with the general public, either. In recent months, the Trump campaign has denied credentials to reporters from BuzzFeed, Fusion, The Des Moines Register, and The Huffington Post, which has shifted much of its coverage of Trump to the Entertainment section. Trump has also routinely bashed the media throughout his candidacy and this week pushed back against the press when confronted with facts that challenged his claims about events surrounding the 9/11 attacks. On Tuesday, Lewandowski even claimed journalists were suppressing evidence that would support Trump's assertion Saturday that ""thousands and thousands"" of people in Jersey City, New Jersey, cheered as the twin towers fell. The event Trump described never happened. "

7,POLITICS,Painkiller Abuse Hits Close To Home For A Majority Of Americans: Poll,Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/painkiller-abuse-survey_us_565380c0e4b0258edb32985d,"Whites, suburbanites and high-income people are the most likely to be touched by the opioid epidemic.",2015-11-24,"A majority of Americans knows someone personally who has abused prescription pain medication, according to a new survey.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=crop_634_11_2040_1800%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON --More than half of Americans know someone who has abused prescription painkillers or died from an overdose, or has taken these medications themselves to get high, as the opioid epidemic continues to spread, according to a new poll.Just 6 percent of those surveyed said they had abused painkillers, such as OxyContin, but 25 percent know a close friend or family member who has. Forty-five percent are acquainted with people who have used these medications without a prescription, and 39 percent know someone who became addicted, according to a Henry J. Kaiser Family foundation survey. Sixteen percent report knowing a person who died from an overdose of pain medication, and 9 percent said they'd lost a relative or good friend to an overdose. Together, that amounts to 56 percent of Americans touched by prescription painkiller addiction, the poll shows.In sharp contrast to the crack cocaine and heroin addictions that plagued American cities in past decades and disproportionately affected racial and ethnic minorities, abuse of pain medicine today is more common among whites, people who live in suburbs and those from high-income households, the survey shows. In addition to rampant abuse of opioid medicines intended for patients with extreme pain, use of heroin -- derived from opium -- has soared. Drug overdoses have surpassed motor vehicle crashes as the leading cause of deaths from injury in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The demographics behind the crisis may explain why the political establishment is responding differently than it did to past drug addiction outbreaks. Relatively affluent, educated white voters in suburbs, small towns and rural areas have more influence with politicians. Presidential candidates campaigning in places like New Hampshire -- which has a significant drug addiction problem -- are sounding compassionate notes, not emphasizing criminal crackdowns on people who have substance use problems or blaming cultural decay.Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have emphasized expanding access to treatment for people with substance use problems in their campaign platforms. On the Republican side, candidates have highlighted personal connections to the issue, including Carly Fiorina speaking of her step-daughter's death from drug use and Chris Christie telling voters of his daughter's struggles with addiction.President Barack Obama staged a summit on the issue last month, and has implemented policies in recent months to address the epidemic, such as increasing access to prescription drugs like buprenorphine to treat addiction and emergency medicine like naloxone that can prevent overdose deaths. State and local authorities, especially in places like Kentucky and New England states hard hit by the epidemic, also are tackling the problem.The public believes the government has a responsibility to stem the worsening painkiller addiction problem, but is divided, 36 percent to 39 percent, over whether the federal government or states should take the lead. The results roughly fall along partisan lines, with Republicans more likely to favor state action and Democrats to support federal interventions, the Kaiser Family Foundation poll found. Republicans were less likely to believe naloxone, or Narcan, which can prevent overdose death if administered quickly, should be available without a prescription. Sixty-three percent of respondents approve of the ""good Samaritan"" laws -- designed to encourage drug users to seek medical help for other users without fear of arrest -- including majorities of Democrats and Republicans.Asked what public policies would be effective in countering painkiller abuse, treatment for addicts was the most popular answer to the survey, with 85 percent supporting this approach. Tracking painkiller prescriptions and improving physician training on appropriate use of the medicines also ranked highly.Also on HuffPost:"
8,SPORTS,Cleveland Browns Bench Johnny Manziel For Partying Too Hard,Justin Block,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cleveland-browns-johnny-manziel-benched_us_5654cbf1e4b0d4093a599148,But they let him start during his domestic violence investigation.,2015-11-24,Quarterback Johnny Manziel #2 of the Cleveland Browns looks on from the field after a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5654cd982100003e005ab92e.jpeg?cache=sG8LZHauwV&ops=crop_0_300_2906_1911%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Johnny Manziel's NFL career took another detour on Thursday when Browns head coach Mike Pettine announced that Manziel won't start in next week's Monday Night Football matchup against the Baltimore Ravens. The demotion to third-string quarterback after starting the two previous games is apparently a result of a video surfacing of Manziel drinking champagne at a club in Austin, Texas, during the team's bye week last weekend. Pettine's Tuesday afternoon statement on Manziel alluded to the video and read in part:Everyone in this organization wants what is best for Johnny just like we do for every player in our locker room. I’m especially disappointed in his actions and behavior because he has been working very hard. The improvements from last year to this year have been tremendous but he still has to consistently demonstrate that he has gained a good understanding of what it takes to be successful at the quarterback position on this level. It goes well beyond the field. We are going to continue to support him in every way possible, but at this point, we’ve decided it’s best to go with Josh as the starter going forward.Manziel's drinking is a known issue. He has gone through rehab at a drug and alcohol treatment facility. The Browns supported his recovery efforts at the time, so to see Manziel clubbing during the season is undoubtedly disappointing -- something Pettine said himself on Tuesday morning. But it's noteworthy that the quarterback was apparently demoted as a result of his partying, but not while the NFL investigated a roadside dispute with his girlfriend that led to accusations that he hit her. Manziel played three games while the league looked into it. Both local police and the NFL decided to not charge Manziel following an investigation, citing a lack of corroborating physical evidence, and Pettine did call the domestic violence allegations ""disturbing"" at the time, but the decision to let him play while the investigation was ongoing was surprising at the time, especially considering 75 percent of domestic violence cases go unreported. Any official report of domestic violence needs to be taken very, very seriously. Following that incident, Manziel gained the starting quarterback job through an injury to Josh McCown, and just last week, ironically spoke about not trying to embarrass himself or his team anymore.Too late for that.

We offer our thoughts, prayers and full condolences to her family. We will grieve with them, and with them we will never forget her sacrifice.”According to Fox31 Denver, the suspect in Jursevics' death has been placed under investigation for vehicular homicide, leaving the scene of a deadly accident, driving under the influence and careless driving causing death.Jursevics' daughter Morgan is only 8 months old. Susan Hinshaw, the wife of fellow Colorado State Trooper Scott Hinshaw, set up a GoFundMe page to raise money for the fallen officer's family.

""Knowing how Jaimie impacted so many lives and her accomplishments as a state trooper makes me extremely proud to be her husband,"" he said, adding, ""She was a loving wife and an amazing mother to our baby daughter.

The news was first reported by The Dallas Morning News on Monday. White confirmed the Cowboys' reasoning to TMZ Sports on Tuesday, saying that a coach specifically told him that he was released for not wearing a suit. ""I'm not mad ... It's the rules,"" he told TMZ Sports, adding that he wore slacks and a button-down on the trip -- an outfit choice that evidently breaks the teams dress code. An anonymous Cowboys player further explained the cuts in the Morning News' report by saying, ""Sometimes you just have to drop the hammer."" That quote, in the context of everything that's surrounded Dallas Cowboy Greg Hardy this season, is disappointing, to say the least. The Cowboys were all too willing to use ""the hammer"" on backup players who don't dress up to an arbitrary professional standard, yet the team's misogynistic, allegedly abusive defensive star can brew his own drama and show up late to work without any tangible repercussions.   For the third time this season, Hardy was late to team facilities again last Thursday, and then late to another meeting last Saturday, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. This prompted another ""come to Jerry"" moment from the organization, which at this point in the Cowboys' 3-7 season, wreaks of desperation.The Cowboys will do back-flips to keep their best defensive lineman out on the field, but when it comes to judging a player for wearing pants and a shirt, they'll cut you no slack. We'll let you decide what that tells you about the organization's priorities. Also on HuffPost:"
11,POLITICS,How 3 Students Convinced Hillary Clinton To Pay Attention To Rural Schools,Samantha-Jo Roth,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-keota-iowa_us_565493bfe4b0258edb33008e,"“If they lose that school, the community dies.”",2015-11-24,"Abby Schulte, Megan Adam and Kylea Tinneas pose with Hillary Clinton following a campaign event in Coralville, Iowa, on Nov. 3, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5654b3102100003e005ab8fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"KEOTA, Iowa -- Three high school students in a small Iowa town launched a successful social media campaign to persuade Hillary Clinton to visit their school, which they hope will spark a national conversation about the challenges rural schools face.Keota is tucked away in America's heartland, about 40 miles southwest of Iowa City. The town’s population has been dwindling over the years, and now hovers around 1,000 residents.“It’s a small town in the middle of nowhere,” said Megan Adam, a senior at Keota High School. “You look around and you see hog buildings, corn fields and bean fields, and that’s about it.”Education funding is scarce, a common struggle for other rural schools across the country. Rural communities struggle especially with the cost of transportation, which takes a large portion of the budget and leaves less money for teachers and instruction.“There’s not a lot of jobs in Keota because it’s mostly small businesses and farming,” said Abby Schulte, another senior at the school. “We don’t have a lot of things pulling people into our town besides our school.” Schulte, who is one of 18 members of the class of 2016, said budget cuts have hurt the quality of her education because many classes are only available online.“Spanish 3 and 4 are online totally. You can’t take it with a teacher because we only have a part-time Spanish teacher,"" she said. ""Our chemistry, anatomy, physics -- all of that is online.""With an 80-member student body, the high school is in jeopardy of closing, especially after a late-summer veto from Gov. Terry Branstad (R) that would have given Iowa schools $55.7 million in additional funding for the upcoming year. “One of the biggest hurdles is the funding,” said sociology teacher Schuyler Snakenberg. “We get funding per student and with lowering enrollment, we don’t have as many dollars coming in the door.”Snakenberg said the current low funding levels could result in the school’s closure, which in turn would hurt the town.“A school is largely considered to be the heart of a community,” Snakenberg said. “If they lose that school, the community dies.”So Snakenberg challenged the three students in his sociology class to find a way to improve the community, the state and the nation. The students decided to capitalize on the upcoming Iowa caucuses, which have presidential hopefuls criss-crossing the state and visiting its 99 counties. Schulte and Adam, along with junior Kylea Tinneas, launched a Twitter account and corresponding hashtag in September called Keota Hopes For Hillary. They first encouraged their classmates to follow the account and use the hashtag, and then were able to connect with two campaign operatives with Hillary for Iowa.The Keota Hopes For Hillary account had over 1,300 followers as of Tuesday morning, and the students got Clinton's attention after they traveled to a campaign event in Coralville on Nov. 3.“What are your plans to help other rural schools in our same situation?” Adam asked Clinton during a question-and-answer session.In her response, the candidate said she would visit Keota High School.“There was tears of joy, there was laughter,” Tinneas said. “It was an amazing experience for the three of us I’d say.”The group is expecting Clinton to visit the school next month, and hope she will address topics that affect rural communities like Keota.The students say their hours of work will pay off when Clinton arrives for a town hall-style event in their small community. “I think it really demonstrates the democratic process,” Schulte said. “Such a huge political figure is coming to a school where there are only 80 kids in the high school to talk about her plans for improving society, answer our questions about the issues important to us.”“Most people have gone to this school since preschool,” Adam added. “It’s just really important to keep the school in the community.”Also on HuffPost:"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has spoken disapprovingly of super PACs but says he won't ask one such group to stop spending money on his behalf.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/565484941b0000470029e7a6.jpeg?ops=crop_0_77_3000_1996%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has not asked a super PAC supporting his presidential campaign to stop spending money on his behalf, though he’s repeatedly criticized the influence such groups have on elections. In an interview Monday with CNN, Sanders suggested that National Nurses United for Patient Protection, which has spent at least $569,000 on print and online ads backing him, is different from the kinds of groups supporting his opponents in the Democratic primary.""What I have said over and over again is that I have not and will not raise a nickel for a super PAC,"" Sanders said. ""I am the only Democratic candidate who does not have a super PAC. I will not have a super PAC. They are nurses and they are fighting for the health care of their people. They are doing what they think is appropriate. I do not have a super PAC.""The nurses super PAC is affiliated with National Nurses United, which endorsed Sanders in August. The union represents 185,000 nurses. Deborah Burger, co-president of National Nurses United, told CNN the super PAC is ""proud to support Bernie Sanders and will continue to do so."" The super PAC funds its political activities with union dues.Sanders has frequently said that, unlike “virtually every other campaign,” he did not have a super PAC backing his candidacy.Though Sanders isn’t able to directly coordinate with the super PAC, he could have taken the opportunity in the interview to explicitly say that he wanted the nurses group to stop spending in the early presidential states, as his campaign manager, Jeff Weaver, suggested when he told CNN earlier this month that the campaign stood by “our position that we do not want the help of a super PAC.""Spending by outside groups such as super PACs has surpassed $64 million in the 2016 presidential race, with 90 percent of that total coming from single-candidate groups, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.Two super PACs are backing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. One, called Correct the Record, claims the ability to directly coordinate with Clinton’s campaign because it is only posting information about Clinton and her Republican counterparts online, for free, rather than paying for ads or other independent expenditures. Another super PAC, Priorities USA Action, has raised more than $40 million to fund ads in battleground states.A super PAC backing former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, called Generation Forward, has raised relatively small sums and recently laid off field organizers in Iowa. At a candidate forum hosted by MSNBC earlier this month, Sanders accused Clinton of being hypocritical on campaign finance reform.“I don’t think it’s good enough just to talk the talk on campaign finance reform,” Sanders told MSNBC host Rachel Maddow. “You’ve gotta walk the walk.""Democratic campaigns, including Clinton’s, have generally taken the position that they cannot “unilaterally disarm” from the super PAC race, even as they propose various campaign finance reform measures, including rolling back Citizens United. That controversial 2010 Supreme Court decision opened the door to corporations, unions and wealthy individuals raising unlimited sums for candidates as long as they do not coordinate with candidates to determine how to spend the money. This principle has been interpreted broadly, as candidates such as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush (R) have abandoned the illusion of independence by directly staffing their affiliated super PACs and fundraising for them before officially throwing their hats into the presidential race.Also on HuffPost:"
