UK Lawyers say the mounting tally of those arrested and convicted of making offensive comments through social media, shows the problems of a legal system trying to regulate 21st-century communications with 20th century laws. Civil libertarians say it is a threat to free speech in an age when the internet gives everyone the power to be heard around the world. (AP Photo/Sang Tan)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf1242000002d00fdc5ba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Those of us who follow news stories regarding teens and social media may one day look back at the events that unfolded this week in Ridgewood, N.J. as the ""canary in the coal mine"" to a growing danger for our children. What danger is that you ask? The increasing warp speed at which social media and easy access to cell phones allows their mistakes to span the globe in mere seconds. If you don't know what happened in Ridgewood I'll give you the recap very quickly (or you can read the Ridgewood Patch article right here -- it's especially insightful to read the 100+ comments from many of the town's own citizens). Underage girls, using the wildly popular smartphone app Snapchat sent compromising photos of themselves to boys in the school. Snapchat, in case you haven't heard about it, allows people to send texts or photos that ""self destruct."" Except that nothing sent through social media is controllable once it leaves your hands. The boys took a picture of the screen when the photo was revealed, and then posted that on Instagram. It quickly took off and was circulated from there. According to Patch.com, ""In a letter sent to parents on Wednesday, Fishbein said police have called for an 'amnesty period' for those found to have created, transmitted or possessed any illict images or movies."" That amnesty period comes to an end on Monday, where all photos of the girls should have been erased. (A telling solution as to how clueless both kids and adults are regarding social media -- as there is no way to determine or to guarantee that those pictures are ever completely ""erased"" from cyberspace). Mind you, there is nothing special about this case. This is happening everywhere. Teens take risks, they push the boundaries that we, as parents think we have established, and they make mistakes -- lots and lots of dumb mistakes. Hopefully they learn from them -- that's called growing up. But never before have we had to worry about the speed and reach of these mistakes being so vast and so difficult to correct.Pew Internet Research revealed last week that not only do 95 percent of teens use the Internet, just about half of them have access to it anytime they want, right in their pockets -- via smartphones. Well, those phones don't seem so smart when they become an instant delivery system for naked pictures or bullying Facebook posts. But what is a parent to do? Personally, my daughter owning a smartphone began as a way to tether us during the day, while I am at work, and she is at school, and then walking home, and then doing her homework. I'm not willing, at this point to give up the ability to contact her at a moment's notice -- or to have her communicate with family members when necessary. But as a parent, how do I keep her safe from all of the other risky behavior that owning a smart phone can make so easy?Parents need creative solutions. While I may have co-founded a social network for families where parents can teach their children about social media in a safe, private environment, my teen is also active on other, more public sites. We all know that the best defense is a good offense, so as a parent I try to constantly stay abreast of what the ""cool"" social media sites are, and where my daughter is engaging. A great resource that I have stumbled upon is Quib.ly, a free, online community that offers crowdsourced insights from parents and experts focused specifically on the intersection of parenting and technology. And I am not alone. Quib.ly Editor in Chief Holly Seddon told me that the most popular questions/answers conversations on the site revolve around cell phone usage. Below is our conversation including the best nuggets of advice that have been passed back and forth between parents on Quib.ly. How popular are, or (are not) the questions on cell phones as compared to others?Holly Seddon:  From the very beginning, we have noticed a significant proportion of the questions posted on Quib.ly relate to cell phones, and in particular smart phones. This is no suprise when you consider that - far from simply being phones used to make calls - these devices are miniature computers, with access to the web, the ability to make purchases (apps, music, games), chat functions and location services. Getting a phone for your child just isn't a simple decision and parents are realizing that they need to tool up and understand how to make these devices as safe as possible, as well as how to equip kids with the knowledge and common sense to use them appropriately. This is reflected in the diverse questions asked on Quib.ly, from the practical stuff like what ground rules should come with a phone and whether kids should take their phones to bed to financial matters like how to manage their bills through to what parents should know about chat apps. What is the most popular topic/question on your site for parents of teens? Holly Seddon: Although all of our sections are popular, we definitely see an enormous enthusiasm among parents and experts talking about education, safety and privacy, gaming, digital future and, of course, mobile. Because of the nature of the community -- Quib.ly has hundreds of parents and experts adding questions and answers 24/7 -- the most popular topics and questions change constantly! Our trending topics are a great way to see what are currently big talking points. At the time of writing, trending topics include whether a 15-year-old boy should have a mobile, how the next crop of parents will handle online interaction with their kids and whether videogames can boost education. What is the best cell phone parenting advice you have seen on your site?Holly Seddon: Talk to your kids! Seriously, that seems to underpin almost all answers, whether from the perspective of parental experience or expert knowledge. Before handing a phone over, it's about talking to kids about how to keep their property safe, who to give their number out to, what is expected of them... this seems to be at the foundation of a common sense approach. And then once kids have cell phones -- alongside talking about how they're using them -- the crucial thing is for parents to stay abreast of all the new considerations that apps, games and web-searching throw up. For example, chat apps that are increasing in popularity among teens but can't be easily monitored by parents.While some people choose to monitor their kids' phone use, or withhold passwords, this is a very personal choice, whereas the need for open communication between parent and child is universal. What is quib.ly's goal?Holly Seddon:To help parents give their kids a head start in this connected world. There is a daily waterfall of amazing opportunities for learning, playing, socialising and working towards the unimaginable careers of tomorrow. We want to help parents find out about all the cool stuff available to their kids, while helping them to stay aware and alert to the possible risks. Forewarned is forearmed, so we help shrink these dangers back down to size while allowing parents to help immerse their kids in the amazing opportunities technology brings to every facet of life."

And to further incentivize this movement, one architect is bypassing the need for parking in the first place. Sebastian Mariscal is proposing to construct a mixed-use residential building in Boston that would feature 46 private green open spaces -- and zero parking spots. The plan also includes a large garden plaza and roof-top garden beds. If the building gets approval, it will sidestep a Boston rule that requires any new residential building to offer parking space. We hope it does, because this car-reducing, garden-growing space is a boon not only to the environment, but also our well-being.

The reality is, there are countless methods of raising children, and many of them are perfectly healthy. Yet, no matter how many books we read, rules we make, or goals we set, there is one thing that will impact our children above all else, and that is how we feel within ourselves. How we feel about ourselves is naturally, though often unconsciously, extended to our children.How we parent is based not only on the conditions of our own childhood, but on how we adapted to these conditions. We may resolve to be different or do better with our own kids, then find ourselves falling into the exact same patterns that hurt us. Alternately, we may try to compensate for our parents' mistakes and wind up treating our kids in ways that are misattuned or unreflective of our true nature.In order to be the best parents we can be, we have to be in touch with the struggles we face within ourselves. Are we self-hating or self-denying? Are we limited by an inner critic or ""critical inner voice"" that we've internalized? What are the ways we hurt ourselves in our goals or interpersonal relationships? As we get to know our true selves, we can differentiate from undesirable qualities from our past. We can make conscious choices as parents that help us to offer our children the emotional stability and support they need to be strong and resilient. In this process of differentiation, there are several important questions to continually ask ourselves. The first is, how much am I listening to my inner critic?New parents know how easy it is to fall into moments of deep self-doubt or even self-hatred. It's extremely common, as we hold our crying baby, to have thoughts toward ourselves like: ""You don't know what you're doing! You're a terrible mother/father. You can't even make your own baby feel better. You're going to fail at this."" Our critical inner voice represents a cruel thought process that criticizes us throughout our lives. It undermines our efforts and keeps us from achieving our goals. This ""voice"" can also be self-soothing: ""Go ahead and forget about exercising this afternoon. You've had a hard enough day as it is."" And on a dime, it can switch to being highly sadistic, ""You are so lazy. Look at you just sitting there. You never do anything you say you're going to do!""A friend of mine recently admitted to me that she was so self-hating when her son was born that she felt nervous to be alone with him. With no one around, she'd be flooded with fears and insecurities, so much so that her arms would sometimes shake when she held the baby. It wasn't until one day when her mother came over that she realized where this self-doubt might have sourced from. As she went to change her son's diaper, her mother peeked over her shoulder and quietly cooed at the crying baby, ""It's okay, honey. Your mommy doesn't know what she's doing. She just needs to listen to Grandma, and she'll learn."" In an instant, my friend had a flash of being a child herself. She remembered constantly being questioned, corrected, and criticized by her mother, all of which left her feeling as if she was incompetent and stupid. She may have been able to laugh off the condescending comments and tone her mother used with her as an adult. But this feeling that she was incapable had been embedded in her head since she was a little girl, and it was causing her to feel extreme self-hatred in caring for her son.When we are able to trace our emotional reactions to their early roots, it becomes easier to see how this critical inner voice is formed out of hurtful life experiences. Negative interactions or emotions we picked up from our caretakers can shape how we see ourselves as adults. If we had a parent who told us we were lazy or good-for-nothing, those words will stick with us. If we had a parent who was highly self-critical, we may, too, take on this point of view toward ourselves. If we had a parent who was overly focused or emotionally ""hungry"" toward us, we may feel we are never good enough or react adversely to attention.All of these patterns form our critical inner voice. This voice is then there to attack us when we become parents. We may not even experience many of these self-critical thoughts until we have our own children, and feelings and memories from our past are stirred up. This is rarely a conscious process, which is why it is so important for parents to take time to identify their critical inner voice. What are you telling yourself about how you are as a parent? Where might these attitudes come from? How can you stand up to this inner critic and resist acting on its directives?When my friend recognized where her feelings of self-hatred came from, she was able to stand up to this inner critic. One exercise of ""Voice Therapy,"" developed by my father, psychologist and author Robert Firestone, involves putting your critical thoughts in the second-person (as ""you"" statements.) My friend tried this exercise herself with journaling. First, she wrote down her most shameful feelings in relation to herself as a parent. Rather than writing, ""I am a terrible mother,"" she wrote, ""You are a terrible mother."" She proceeded with, ""Your son will grow up hating you. Why can't you just get this right?"" She then followed another important step of Voice Therapy, which involves answering back to these attacks. Adopting a more compassionate and realistic point of view, she wrote, ""I may not know exactly what I'm doing all the time, but I am figuring it out. I care about my son, and I know that when I feel more relaxed, he does, too. These mean thoughts are holding me back. I am capable of being a loving parent.""When we are able to separate from these destructive thoughts, we resist the urge to act on our critical inner voices. For example, my friend could have used her self-hating thoughts to distance herself from her son, which he would have experienced as rejection. We can also resist the tendency to imitate our parents less desirable traits. When we don't identify the ways our parents hurt us, we run the risk of reenacting these patterns ourselves. In addition, by challenging our critical inner voice, we are less likely to overcompensate for our own painful childhood experiences. For example, if we grew up feeling neglected, we may try to make up for it and hurt our kids by being overly intrusive.As parents, it's incredibly important not to project our own negative life experiences onto our children. We must recognize our kids as the unique individuals they are. In doing so, we can accept that we too are unique individuals. By working on ourselves, overcoming our own short comings and standing up to our critical inner voices, we offer our children the greatest gift of all, a healthy, happy parent whom they are free to love, learn from, admire, and imitate.To read more from Dr. Lisa Firestone visit PsychAlive.org.Read more about differentiation in Dr. Firestone's latest book, The Self under Siege."

It also is a welcome lift to Boeing after Indonesia's Lion Air on Monday picked European rival Airbus in a $24 billion firm mega-order. Lion Air had been an exclusively Boeing customer for jets.The industry benchmark 737-800, a 189-seat jet whose main competitor is the Airbus A320, is worth $89.1 million at list prices, but large orders attract steep discounts and industry appraisers value the plane closer to $40 million.""This deal embeds our cost advantage and pricing advantage over our European competitors,"" Ryanair Chief Executive Michael O'Leary told Reuters in a telephone interview.""Hopefully it will help refocus people's minds on the fact that Boeing continues to deliver great aircraft and is growing strongly, rather than a minor issue on the 787,"" he said.O'Leary, who has a reputation for securing bargain aircraft orders during industry slumps, declined to say how much of a discount he obtained for the order. But he said Boeing's struggles with the 787 had created an opportunity for both sides.And, having placed a big order for current-generation 737s, O'Leary said Ryanair could place another order for Boeing's forthcoming 737 MAX, an even more fuel-efficient model.The current 737 deal gives the Irish airline ""breathing room"" to talk to Boeing about orders for the 737 MAX, O'Leary told a New York news conference. He added that Ryanair likes the 737 MAX and would place an order if terms were right.Reuters reported exclusively in late January that Ryanair was closing on a deal for at least 150 current-generation 737 jets to be completed within weeks. Ryanair denied the story at the time.Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Ray Conner said Boeing has not had any difficulty closing major aircraft orders despite the ongoing battery problems with its 787 passenger jet.""We compartmentalize that. We have a lot of people working on the 787 situation ... We're working on producing 787s as we get the battery situation solved,"" Conner said at the news conference on Tuesday.Conner said the Ryanair deal fills up Boeing's 737 production ""pretty significantly"" until 737 MAX assembly starts in the next few years, with first delivery slated for 2017. Boeing is now producing 38 737s a month.Ryanair shares were up almost 4 percent at 1415 GMT at 6.03 euros. Boeing shares were up nearly 0.3 percent at $85.44.""This order puts Ryanair back on track for growth at a time when many European airlines are shrinking,"" said Donal O'Neill, an analyst with Goodbody Stockbrokers in Dublin.""For Boeing it keeps a major customer on board and helps position it to hook Ryanair for an order of the (next-generation) 737 MAX in a few year's time.""O'Leary said Ryanair has set up a senior team to examine the operating efficiencies of the 737 MAX and the benefits of Ryanair being ""a lead customer"" with a large order for the jet.""The minimum order would be 100 and we have asked that team to try to conclude its review before the end of calendar 2013,"" O'Leary said.The current deal will allow Ryanair to extend its lead in the Europe's low-cost travel market, which has grown sharply since the start of the euro zone crisis as flag carriers struggle and business passengers downgrade.Ryanair has aggressively shifted its capacity to fill gaps left by reductions in short-haul flights by flag carriers such as Iberia, and by the collapse of others such as Malev.""We have more growth opportunities in Europe than we can handle,"" O'Leary said.The airline, which had just six jets when O'Leary was hired as deputy chief executive in 1991, now flies more international scheduled passengers than any other airline, according to the International Air Transport Association.BOEING BOOSTThe Ryanair deal is a timely boost to Boeing, which last week won U.S. approval for test flights for its new 787 Dreamliner, which has been grounded for two months after batteries burned on two of the jets in January.The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration last week approved Boeing's plan for testing a revamped battery system for the plane, including tests Boeing had helped develop but not previously used.Boeing predicted the plane would be back in service in weeks, not months. But its biggest 787 customer, All Nippon Airways, said that prediction was too uncertain for it to base planning on.Boeing and Airbus are upgrading their medium-haul passenger models to offer about 15 percent fuel savings from the middle of the decade, raising the prospect of bargains on the outgoing models to help manufacturers ensure steady production.O'Leary said the fact that the 737 provided nine more seats than the A320, which is due to be revamped with fuel efficient engines in 2016, was more important to Ryanair than any possible fuel savings.To pay for the new jets, O'Leary said Ryanair would use internally generated cash flow and debt, avoiding the need to tap shareholders for capital. He said the airline aims to have the average age of planes in its fleet at less than five years once all of the new planes are delivered.He said most of the 737s would be delivered in 2017 and 2018, with about 50 arriving each year."

He traveled on a Cuban passport after an 8-year restriction on his return for illegally defecting expired. If there is a rebuttal to the argument against Cuba travel -- made by folks like Marco Rubio -- it is surely the photos of Ordóñez seeing his birthplace and family again through new eyes.CORRECTION: The original story stated Ordonez was able to return to Cuba thanks to the Obama policy initiative allowing so-called People-to-People trips.

The ship, which Thursday docked in Mobile after drifting nearly powerless in the Gulf of Mexico for five days, was moved Friday from the cruise terminal to a repair facility. The ship carrying more than 4,200 passengers and crew members had been idled for nearly a week in the Gulf of Mexico following an engine room fire. (AP Photo/Dave Martin)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf21e2100003100c5530b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Carnival Cruise Lines has had a rough few weeks, but as difficult as Triumph's drift, Dream's electrical failure and Legend's propulsion problems have likely been on the Carnival Corp. PR team, these seaborne debacles have been harder still on the boats' passengers. By way of making amends, Carnival has offered its indignant clients small amounts of cash and credits for exactly the sort of future cruises they probably want to avoid. That said, Carnival didn't really have to offer the victims of their hospitality anything at all -- an argument, if there ever was one, for third party insurance.Because no one goes to a cocktail party and talks about how great their recent trip insurance was, this part of trip planning goes undiscussed and winds up being misunderstood. Most cruisers simply purchase the insurance packages offered by the cruise lines themselves, policies that often offer travelers far more resources if their own bodies break down than if the ship does. Where cruise line insurance policies offer protection for both the traveler and the cruise line itself, third party insurance is all about the traveler.The major difference between third party and cruise line insurance policies: Third party insurance providers can't hide behind tickets.The idea of hiding behind tickets might conjure a strange image, but it is exactly what cruise lines do after disasters. Cruise tickets, after all, are binding contracts that limit cruise lines' liability while defining the scope of legal action that can be taken against them. Ask a lawyer how to sue a cruise line -- most of which fly foreign flags on their ships and operate in the grey area of international waters -- and prepare to receive legal advice in the form of a rueful head shake.Even after Carnival offered Triumph passengers fresh off that floating port-a-potty $500 and a credit for a future cruise for their troubles, cruise lawyers admitted there was little that could be done. Dream passengers received a refund equivalent to three days of the voyage and 50 percent off a future cruise. Legend passengers got $100 back on pre-paid shore excursions and 50 percent off a future cruise. These compensations were handed out to every passenger -- regardless of insurance -- at the discretion of Carnival itself. Having your company failing pay out on cable isn't great after all. Because Carnival credited the passengers willingly, insurance wouldn't much help, but what having a third party policy did give travelers was the knowledge that they had recourse, a way to recover the money they spent on a nightmare vacation.A decent plan from a respectable and easy to use service like TravelGuard or InsureMyTrip will normally run the customer about 5 percent of total trip cost, barely more than the insurance offered by cruise lines. For travelers going on luxurious round-the-world cruises, this is an investment in a dream. For travelers going on a Carnival cruise to the Caribbean, this is just a good idea: Carnival cruises are both affordable and accident prone, making a third party plan cheap and almost mandatory. Travelers with third party insurance also get a choice that is hard to put a value on, the chance to take their recovered money elsewhere."
