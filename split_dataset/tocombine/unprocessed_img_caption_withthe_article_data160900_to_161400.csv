They make putting a meal together so simple, whether it's breakfast or dinner. But eggs just might be at their best when soft boiled. Soft boiled eggs are the magic that happens right before they become hard. (Not that we have anything against hard-boiled eggs.)When a soft boiled egg is made just right, its whites are set but the yolks are still creamy and rich. And when it's cooked this way, eggs can easily be used to top just about any dish -- and make it better.Want to read more from HuffPost Taste? Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and Tumblr. "

The new virus is not the same as SARS, but similar to it and also to other coronaviruses found in bats.The WHO first issued an international alert in September after the virus infected a Qatari man in Britain who had recently been in Saudi Arabia.Symptoms of NCoV include severe respiratory illness, fever, coughing and breathing difficulties.""Preliminary investigation indicated that the (latest Saudi)patient had no contact with previously reported cases of NCoV infection,"" the WHO said. ""Other potential exposures are under investigation.""Nine of the 15 people confirmed to have been infected with NCoV have died. Most cases have been in the Middle East or in patients who had recently travelled there.Research by scientists in Europe has found that NCoV is well adapted to infecting humans and may be treatable with medicines similar to the ones used for SARS, which killed a tenth of the 8,000 people it infected.The Geneva-based WHO said it was monitoring the situation closely and urged its member states to continue surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections and to carefully review any unusual patterns.""WHO is currently working with international experts and countries where cases have been reported to assess the situation and review recommendations for surveillance and monitoring,"" it said, adding that national authorities should ""promptly assess and notify"" it of any new NCoV cases.

2,WELLNESS,Rand Paul's Bladder: Patriotism and the Micturition Reflex,"Craig Bowron MD FACP, Contributor
I'm a physician and writer on the North Coast",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/rand-paul-filibuster_us_5b9ce9c7e4b03a1dcc82eaa5,"At this point, only a urinal somewhere just outside the Senate chambers knows the truth. And of course, the CIA.",2013-03-12,"This video frame grab provided by Senate Television shows Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. speaking on the floor of the Senate on Capitol Hill in Washington, Wednesday, March 6, 2013. Senate Democrats pushed Wednesday for speedy confirmation of John Brennan's nomination to be CIA director but ran into a snag after a Paul began a lengthy speech over the legality of potential drone strikes on U.S. soil. But Paul stalled the chamber to start what he called a filibuster of Brennan's nomination. Paul's remarks were centered on what he said was the Obama administration's refusal to rule out the possibility of drone strikes inside the United States against American citizens. (AP Photo/Senate Television)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce9c725000036003641de.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Judging by the public's response, Rand Paul's filibuster was somewhere between an impassioned, patriotic ""big tent"" moment for Republicans and a kooky publicity stunt aimed at finally getting the work of rapper Wiz Khalifa into the Congressional record.The issue at stake -- Americans' right to due process before being incinerated by a CIA drone -- was almost overshadowed by the senator's bladder function, which was both derided and praised.Paul himself blamed his bladder for his failure to break the standing 28-hour filibuster record. ""I would go for another 12 hours to try to break Strom Thurmond's record, but I've discovered that there are some limits to filibustering and I'm going to have to go take care of one of those in a few minutes here,"" Paul admitted as audience members snickered. And yet Harry Reid praised it as proof of Paul's conviction: I've been involved in a few filibusters, as Rand Paul did yesterday. And what I've learned from my experiences with talking filibusters is this: To succeed you need strong convictions, but also a strong bladder. It's obvious -- Senator Paul has both.Paul's filibuster was politically gutsy, but was it an act of urological courage?The human bladder is made of muscle, and because it can relax, pressures inside the bladder remain fairly low until it holds around 300 ccs (there are about 350 ccs in a 12-ounce can). For most people, the first faint sense of bladder fullness comes at 200 ccs, and the urge to void (what urologists call ""peeing"" or ""taking a whiz"") comes at 300 ccs. Beyond that, bladder pressures rise sharply and the urge to relieve one's self becomes progressively more intense.You can pee without your brain, but under optimal conditions, your brain gets to say where and when. The squeezing of the bladder, the ""micturition reflex,"" is a completely autonomic (automatic) reflex commanded by a set of nerves coming to and from the bladder and arcing through the spinal cord. But our brain is able to tone down that reflex (to a certain point) so that the expanding bladder doesn't squeeze. And the brain has voluntary control over the external urinary sphincter, a valve that can cinch down and resist the will of a contracting bladder.Republican, Democrat, Independent, that's how the healthy bladder works. How quickly a bladder fills depends on how much urine a person is making, and that depends on a whole host of variables. But the minimum amount of water the kidneys can let go of in a day and still do their job is about 500 ccs, and the average amount of urine produced in a day is about 1,400 ccs -- picture a 1.5-liter bottle of ""nature's calling."" So in Paul's case, the numbers look like this: Assuming he started the filibuster on empty, if he got himself dehydrated up there on the podium and was making 20 ccs of concentrated urine every hour, 12 hours and 52 minutes later he'd have had 260 ccs of urine in his bladder. That's well short of the maximal bladder capacity of 400-500 ccs, and it's a bladder volume associated with only mild urge -- neither newsworthy or laudable. On the other hand, if he kept at the fluids enough to maintain a more typical urine output of 60 ccs an hour, then by the end of the filibuster, his senatorial bladder would have been stretched thin by an excruciating 770 ccs -- a heroic act of patriotism and steely resolve. At this point, only a urinal somewhere just outside the Senate chambers knows the truth. And of course, the CIA.For more on personal health, click here.For more by Craig Bowron, click here."

I've not yet met a person who doesn't underestimate themselves, who isn't shocked to realize what they're able to accomplish and what an incredible impact they can have on other people. My dear friend Leah Curney, who wrote and stared in her first off-Broadway show last week, was stunned by the amazing reception it got. Having read the script, and being moved to tears last time she sang to me, I wasn't surprised in the slightest. But when I got an email last week from a reader writing to thank me for Men, Money & Chocolate, ""for the words that inspired me to become the me I always wanted to be,"" I soaked up startled tears of surprise.It's usually that way. We don't see our own gifts, just as we don't see the self-sabotaging traits that hold us back from success. So it helps to employ the compassionate, honest eyes of friends or mentors -- people we can trust to see the truth and show it to us. But, even then, we're often more able to hear negative than positive feedback. To be told that we're lovely and amazing can, strangely, be a hard thing to hear. How easy is it, after all, to hold the gaze of someone who loves you for a long time? Most of us have a low threshold for such intimacy and adoration. And yet, if we can't let much love in, then life will never work out the way we want it to.

The report, ""Putting Sustainability on the Table: Airport Workers’ Vision for $3 Billion of Food and Drink at O’Hare,"" finds that both passengers and workers want more access to healthy, local, fresh food.Soon, the city of Chicago will set guidelines for and request proposals from food companies interested in providing concessions at the airport. The contract could be worth up to $3 billion. The 200-worker survey found that 57 percent of airport worker respondents said that customers have asked if their food was cooked from scratch or from pre-made or frozen ingredients. Of passengers surveyed, 78 percent said that they would like to see food cooked from fresh ingredients, while 89 percent of workers said they would like to see restaurants that prepare food from scratch.Beyond the demand for fresh food, respondents were also interested in healthy and local food options, with 68 percent of passengers surveyed favoring an increase in healthy food options. Moreover, 86 percent of workers surveyed think that O'Hare should buy food that is grown locally. The survey comes on the heels of the news that New York's JFK airport will undergo a $28 million food renovation in its Delta terminal. The food options there will include fast food retailers, however, so the era of unhealthy airport food isn't quite over yet."

Ask what makes you come alive and then do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive.""-- Howard ThurmanThe average adult who goes to Disney World will walk away with two primary responses. First, they'll note that what Disney sets out to do, it does very well; and second, they'll realize that they've just spent a lot of money to create the very same experiences that on any other day they'd try to avoid (like spending a lot of money). This realization came to me several years ago, when I was waiting in long lines amidst congested crowds of people in the hot sun in my quest to ride down a fake river in a contrived raft. Over the course of four days, not only did I make it down the river, but I was also thrown, spun, flung, dropped, scared, and repeatedly knocked over by an enormous wave. I basically paid to have the crap kicked out of me in the name of being entertained.And interestingly, I was. As I gripped my bathing suit top for dear life while being engulfed by a typhoon, I felt utterly alive. The people around me seemed alive as well. It was a contrast to the experience of walking down a city street and seeing solemn and distant faces. Here, everyone was present. They were animated and vocal, gasping every time the wave would start to come and recounting their adventures to those standing near them as the wave passed. There seemed to be a simplicity in their joy that resembled an infant dropping an object off his high chair over and over and being delighted by its magical return.As I walked around Mickey's Kingdom, I wondered why our average towns can't feel this magical. Isn't that really what we want -- to feel this quality of enchantment and lightness in day-to-day life? I see a yearning for this in how trees stretch up toward the sun, how we look forward to vacations, even in how children draw people's hands as large, open circles with fingers radiating outward. I see it in the actions of my great-aunt, who in her mid-90s hitchhiked to see Engelbert Humperdinck in concert. It's all the same impulse. We want to feel good, to feel happy, to feel alive. Maybe, too, along with wanting to show up fully in life and see the beauty around us, we also want to be knocked over and swept away from time to time -- to fall in love with life and feel enchanted by what it has to offer. Finding our way to this type of aliveness and enchantment isn't always a simple task. One obstacle is that, as a culture, we seem to have a hard time figuring out how to be in relationship with good things. In some ways, our society ignores them. We only have to watch the news to see that happy topics are rarely newsworthy. Leaning in the other direction, our culture, at times, has oversimplified how to feel good. For example, the encouragement in the 1980s to ""just think positive"" suggested that by chopping off our darkness and willing ourselves toward happiness and aliveness, we would find our way there. Maybe as a response to such suggestions, people became a bit suspicious about being positive: questioning if people who are happy are also shallow, or selfish, or even up to something illegal.The journey toward aliveness is also complicated, because what ignites each of us differs. We don't all want to go to an amusement park. Even parts of me didn't want to go to Disney World, feeling much more content to sit in a cabin by the woods. I'm reminded of the movie Pleasantville, in which each of the characters comes into full color at a particular point. For one, it's when she decides to take care of her own needs. For another, it's when he finally honors his true passion in life. My favorite, however, is an adolescent boy who stands up for someone else by slugging a bully. In the moment of stepping into his courage, he comes more fully alive.I love theologian Howard Thurman's encouragement that we need to explore what makes us come alive -- that sitting with this question is more an obligation than a luxury. Sometimes we need to consider this question in terms of what can bring enjoyment and excitement to our lives. Sometimes, too, the key to our aliveness lies in the intersection between what we love to do and how this activity might meet the greater needs of our local or global community. There's nothing like making a difference in the world around us to offer a sense of meaning and fulfillment in our lives.

But what about those long lulls in which not a single noble ties the knot? Thankfully, we have society weddings to hold us over. Sir Richard Branson's son Sam Branson wed Isabella Calthorpe last week in South Africa during a five-day fête chock full of royals and celebs. The extravagant activity roster -- which included costume parties, safaris and bongo lessons -- earned the event the nickname ""the nearly royal wedding.""Unlike a royal wedding, however, Hello! magazine was on the guest lists to report on all of the aforementioned celebrations. In case you're not so familiar with British society circles, the bride is an actress, daughter to a *real* Lady Mary and half sister to Prince Harry's latest flame Cressida Bonas. Oh, and she's that infamous girl who got away from Prince William (he courted her during the on-again-off-again phase of his relationship with Kate Middleton). But we digress. The wildlife-themed nuptials featured the 33-year-old bride in a lace Monique Lhullier confection and lots of white rose petals. Guests, including Princess Beatrice, Princess Eugenie, Natalie Imbruglia and Cressida (without Harry), watched the actual ceremony take place under a ""sacred"" tree in Ulusaba, Sir Richard's private animal reserve. Hello! even reports that Cressida sang a romantic song afterwards. Very cute.""The ceremony was so emotional and beautiful,"" Princess Beatrice told Hello!. ""Sam did so well not crying, but none of the rest of us can say the same. There was hardly any point in wearing make-up."" Awww. Think she donned a fascinator as perplexing as the Philip Treacy number she wore to Kate and Will's wedding?While this might just be the most unique society wedding we've ever seen, how do you think it stacks up against last year's royal Luxembourg and Austrian nuptials? Or, dare we say it, that of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge? And hey, if the Branson wedding was't quite your cup of tea, there's always the Swedish royal wedding in June to satisfy your cravings.See Hello! magazine's full coverage of the Branson wedding here.PHOTO:How did this one compare to the last Brit royal wedding?Want more?
