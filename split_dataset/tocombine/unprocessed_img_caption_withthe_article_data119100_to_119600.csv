It must await the readiness of choice. A choice to open its inner eyes and recognize the cage is always one of our own making.,2014-06-05,2014-06-03-birdwingsskyflyinghdfreeanimalswallpapers.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-06-03-birdwingsskyflyinghdfreeanimalswallpapers-thumb.jpg,"This past weekend, like many others, I found myself vegging out in my pajamas watching Super Soul Sunday on the OWN network. I was refreshed by the collage presentation made in honor of Maya Angelou, an extraordinary woman and teacher. ""Momma Ya,"" as I refer to Maya (Momma, synonymous with Mother in the South, and Ya, derived from a Spanish word meaning ""in this very moment"") shared her profound spiritual wisdom. I watched attentively and with admiration.In one scene, Oprah Winfrey asked Maya, ""Why does the cage bird sing?"" as they discussed her book and poem ""I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings."" Maya responsed, ""The cage bird sings because it must."" At first I did not grasp the significance of her statement, but the words echoed in my mind as I lay down to sleep. What did they mean? I pondered. When have I been a ""caged bird?""   I went in and out of consciousness all night long as these words trickled their way through the many layers of my own experiences, forcing themselves to be understood. I suddenly woke up at 4:32am with a visceral knowing. In my book, Connecting to Love: Unleashing the Power of Yes, I speak of a childhood experience that I had viewed during most of my adult life as being ""traumatic."" I was eight or nine years old when I heard a man voicing a compliment to my mother about my beauty. My little heart sped up with anticipation for it was the first time I felt I had been ""seen."" Seconds passed and my mother responded with modesty in a rather flat tone. ""We are teaching her to be smart."" I felt as if the wind was drawn from me and my heart sank. I was confused. My young mind could not process my mother's words. In that moment it drew a conclusion and made up a lie: ""I must be ugly."" I quickly resigned myself to live under this new perceived reality deeming myself as unworthy. In that instant I became the ""caged bird."" Veiled by the illusion we fathom as reality, we sequester our light. We become blinded by its power and in its place we welcome our ""shadow,"" the catalyst responsible for our conscious awakening. In other words, the realization of contrast. I fully believe that we arrive on this earthly plane with a preset curriculum. One that is repeated time and time again until we learn the lessons of love. Forgiveness, compassion, vulnerability, and wholeheartedness are among the subcategory under the ""Lessons of Love"" umbrella. We come here to master these lessons in order to embody the One Infinite Creator as it sees itself through us, as you and as me. Not until we fully understand the nature of this ""beingness"" and can feel its essence and truths all the way down to our toes, can we begin to pass on this wisdom to others who ready themselves for their own journey. For me, it took over 40 years of spiritual seeking and self-battering before I was able to see the childhood memory for what it was: a reminder of the primordial truth. When I was finally able to perceive beyond my need or desire for acceptance, I recognized the enormity of the gift my mother had offered at the time. My shadow had protected me from vanity and I was now ready to embrace the oneness of love. A completeness and unity with all there is. I am deeply grateful to my mother for her foresight and dedication to hold space for a wholesome upbringing. I fulfilled the most important lesson in the syllabus I had outlined for this existence. ""Look not with your physical eyes but through the window of your soul, for beauty abounds."" The caged bird sings because it must remember who or what it is at its core. It must await the readiness of choice. A choice to open its inner eyes and recognize the cage is always one of our own making. Thank you Maya for the lessons of love you so tenderly imparted to us all. May you sing as a free bird from the highest peak atop the Father's eternal throne."

John Boehner (R-OH) holds his weekly press conference at the U.S. Capitol on May 22, 2014 in Washington, DC. During his statements, Boehner said that he is getting closer to calling on Veteran Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign. (Photo by T.J.

A very big raise.Stagnant hourly wages are the ""core economic challenge of our time,"" economists Josh Bivens, Elise Gould, Lawrence Mishel and Heidi Shierholz wrote in a new paper published Wednesday by the Economic Policy Institute, a think tank focused on labor issues.Many of the country's most taxing economic problems -- including poverty, rising inequality, falling mobility, and the decline of middle-class living standards -- can be tackled simply by paying people more, according to the paper. If the U.S. doesn't raise hourly wages for a broad swath of Americans, then those issues will get a lot harder to fix, they wrote.The trouble is that such a dramatic change will likely need the help of Congress, where wage-hike bills typically go to die.At the root of the problem is a growing disconnect between worker productivity and hourly pay: Workers are doing more and earning less for it. For much of American history, worker productivity and wages rose in tandem, which made economic sense. But that changed in the past half-century. Worker productivity began climbing a lot faster than worker wages. This chart illustrates that point pretty clearly:Not everyone suffered, however: A tiny minority of the U.S. benefited from these productivity gains. That group was the top 1 percent of earners, whose wages have grown a lot faster than the rest of ours.Those who haven't benefited quite as nicely include the middle class, people living at or near the poverty line, blacks and Hispanics. So what gives? Is China responsible, by taking all of our good middle-class jobs? Or are robots the culprit?Not quite, according to the EPI report. The real problem is that our elected leaders are stifling economic growth. The EPI report lists a number of specific government policies to blame. One is the minimum wage: At $7.25 an hour, the federal minimum wage is ""currently more than 25 percent below its peak in 1968,"" when adjusted for inflation, according to the report. Indeed, as other research has pointed out, the federal minimum wage would be around $10 if it were pegged to inflation. Or about $22 if it kept up with increases in productivity. And while President Obama has proposed raising the minimum wage to $10.10, policymakers keep stalling his efforts, despite support from a majority of Republicans and a bunch of leading economists, among others. Labor laws that protect unions from ""employer aggressiveness"" and defend workers from wage theft could also help, according to the EPI. It's also time to update the Fair Labor Standards Act, which sometimes lets employers avoid paying low-wage workers for overtime, the economists write. That last one is a reform that Obama has pushed the Labor Department to pursue.“Once you realize that wage growth has been hampered by specific policy actions we have or have not taken, it becomes easier to find solutions,” EPI president Lawrence Mishel wrote in a statement. “This is the first step in identifying ways that we can jumpstart Americans’ stagnant wages.” "
2,RELIGION,Supreme Court Declines To Hear Case Against Tennessee Mosque,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/islamic-center-of-murfreesboro_n_5439867.html,,2014-06-04,"Construction continues on the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro Thursday, July 19, 2012 in Murfreesboro, Tenn. Tennessee Muslims who won a court battle to occupy their new mosque learned Thursday they won't be able to begin worshipping there for the start of Ramadan because it needs about two weeks more of construction work. (AP Photo/Stephen Lance Dennee)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7e7cb2200005700dd307e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NASHVILLE, Tenn. (RNS) For years, opponents of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro vowed to take their legal fight to shut down the mosque all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.That fight ended Monday (June 2), when the nation’s highest court declined to hear their case.The four-year conflict over construction of the mosque, which opened in 2012, brought national attention to this Bible Belt city of 112,000 about 30 miles south of Nashville.Hundreds marched in protest after Rutherford County officials approved plans for the mosque in 2010. Televangelist Pat Robertson labeled the Islamic center a “mega mosque” and claimed Muslims were taking over Murfreesboro. An arsonist set fire to construction equipment on the building site.Mosque opponents eventually filed a suit against Rutherford County, seeking to block construction of the worship space.On the surface, the fight was over the minutiae of Tennessee’s sunshine, or public notice, laws. Mosque foes claimed local officials failed to give adequate notice of a meeting where plans for the mosque’s construction were approved.But a thriving anti-Muslim movement in Tennessee fueled the fight. Mosque foes asserted that the First Amendment’s guarantee of religious freedom did not apply to the mosque. In court, Joe Brandon Jr., a lawyer for mosque foes, said Islam is not a religion, and he argued that the mosque was a threat to the community.Initially, a local judge ruled for the mosque foes and ordered a halt to mosque construction. But a federal court quickly overruled that decision, paving the way for the mosque to open in 2012. A state appeals court also later overturned the lower court decision.Local Muslims, many of whom had worshipped in the community for years, found themselves having to defend their faith and their status as American citizens at the trial.It was a difficult process, said Saleh Sbenaty, a college professor and longtime member of the Islamic Center.Members of the Islamic Center found help in local interfaith groups and other local leaders who rallied to their assistance. More than 100 local religious leaders signed a letter supporting the mosque.Sbenaty said his faith in the American justice system never faltered.“Today the Constitution prevailed,” he said. “It shows that the Constitution upholds the rights of those who are in the minority.”Remziya Suleyman, director of policy and administration for the Nashville-based American Center for Outreach, said that a lot of good has come from conflict over the mosque. Local Muslims are more engaged in the community, she said, and have closer ties to local interfaith groups. They’ve also gotten a great deal of community support.But she regrets that the county had to spend more than $340,000 in legal fees fighting the lawsuit. Suleyman is relieved and grateful that the lawsuit has finally been put to rest.“Clearly, enough was enough,” she said.Having a new building has been a boon to members of the Islamic Center.For years, congregation members had worshipped in converted offices at an industrial park, where the space was cramped and parking limited.Today, weekly prayer services draw as many as 600 people, and there’s plenty of space for all.“This is home now,” Sbenaty said.Imam Ossama Bahloul said the new facility, which includes a playground, gives the community more space to worship and invite guests. The center has hosted visits from a number of church groups and a Nashville synagogue.He said that the congregation always had faith that the law was on their side.“We believe in the Constitution and we followed the rules,” he said. “Now it’s time to put all of this behind us.”Foes of the mosque haven’t given up yet. A group of plaintiffs recently filed suit to block local Muslims from building a cemetery on the mosque grounds.According to the Daily News Journal in Murfreesboro, a ruling on the cemetery lawsuit is expected in mid-June."

Frankel has since been very open about the caustic process that followed, most recently sharing that Hoppy said he was going to ""destroy her.""As for the fight over their daughter, Frankel's attorney told People that she is ""delighted that this custody battle has been resolved; that his co-parenting status has been acknowledged; that the parties' child will have the benefit of being raised by both parents; and most importantly, that his daughter will no longer be at the mercy of a high-profile courtroom battle."" This is really the first good news in what has been a very long process. As for the future, Frankel told Redbook it's unlikely she'll marry again. Notably, Frankel's recognition that it is ""too soon to think about"" remarriage is at least more optimistic than the time she compared dating after divorce to eating after food poisoning."

I don't enjoy meaningless sex -- which I had the last five years of my marriage -- but I am all for high-octane adult fun. And since I had spent the last 20 years married, I was in no hurry to get back into another long-term, monogamous relationship.My profile essays hinted at my open-mindedness, but the answers to my questions cleared up any doubt. I answered in the affirmative to questions about sex toys, midday masturbation, hair-pulling, safewords, and submission (negative to dolphin-squealing, however). I unleashed my irreverent sense of humor in the explications to the questions. Responding to ""would you ever date someone simply because they were well-endowed?"" I answered yes, with the comment: ""I'm deeeeeeply superficial.""Most of the men who wrote me got my sense of humor, and reached out in part because they thought I was funny. One man, however, took offense at my profile. He said, essentially, that I needed to grow up. He told me it was unseemly for a 50-year-old woman to speak so openly about sex and penis preferences (my facetiousness went about a mile over his head).""How do you ever expect to find a serious relationship if you emphasize sex?"" he asked. He then offered to help me re-write my profile to attract the ""right"" kind of man -- ""right,"" I presumed, being right like him.Although I was tempted to fire off a message reaming him for his slut-shaming and age-shaming, I realized that he was mostly likely jonesing for an outraged response, which would then invite further moralizing about my tawdry nature and dismal long-term prospects.So I deleted his message and tried to forget about it.But I couldn't. As I sat on my bed trying to bring my boiling blood down to a simmer, I found myself wondering, what if he's right?What if all those books and web sites telling women that men won't see them as relationship material if they put out before the eleventh date are right? And if men don't respect a young woman who's honest about wanting sex, how much less will they respect an older woman who still -- still! At 50! -- wants sex? And doesn't try to hide it?There's an extra layer of shame to being told you're an old slut. A young woman's ""sluttiness"" can be excused in part because she hasn't lived long enough to buy into social mores, and she's too hormonal to delay gratification. But an older woman who admits that she likes erotic pleasure without all the packaging? That's not just slutty. Apparently, it's freakish.After a few moments of imagining my 75-year-old self aimlessly padding around my apartment in a tattered negligee like some burlesque cat lady, I decided to stop indulging the narcissism of a guy who perhaps was not eliciting the response he'd hoped for from women, and decided he'd project his sense of inadequacy onto a woman who likely wouldn't want him.If my honesty was weeding out men who liked their women conventional and their sex vanilla, then all the better. That was not the kind of man I was hoping to attract anyway. And if I couldn't find a guy who could love and respect a mature woman who was both overtly intelligent and sexual, then better to share my bed with my books and my cat.I also wanted to weed out serial seducers who con women into thinking they want a serious relationship in order to get sex. So I decided to ratchet up the honesty factor to force suitors to admit their true intentions.I deleted my previous, not particularly attention-grabbing comment in the ""what I spend a lot of time thinking about"" section and inserted the following:Sex and TransparencyAdding this clause did exactly what it was designed to do. It has given men who are really just looking for sex permission to contact me and say just that. It has attracted men who have a sense of humor and who respect a woman who owns her sexuality. It has prompted conversations about the wasted time and hurt feelings caused by the lack of sexual transparency. And, I'm happy to report, it has not elicited a single outraged response from a man who thinks he has the right to regulate my sexuality.Owning my sexuality, both on OkCupid, and in real life, has been profoundly empowering. It's a gift that has come with age. I was so crippled by social conventions when I was young that I compartmentalized my sexual persona -- a move that killed the chance for true intimacy with any man.The only regret I have about coming out of the ""good girl"" closet is that it took me until I turned 50 to do so.Earlier on Huff/Post50:"
5,POLITICS,Tech Titans From Both Parties Get Behind Super PAC To End All Super PACs,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mayday-pac-tech_n_5442230.html,,2014-06-04,"Peter Thiel, president of Thiel Capital, speaks at the annual Milken Institute Global Conference in Beverly Hills, California, U.S., on Monday, April 29, 2013.

Fallon/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8cbd41f00003d0225714f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Big-name technology titans from different ideological backgrounds are backing a super PAC formed by Harvard professor Lawrence Lessig to reform the nation's campaign finance laws.The Mayday PAC, launched on May 1, announced a crowd funding plan to raise $12 million to back supporters of publicly financed elections in 2014. If people help raise $1 million, with contributions of $10,000 or less, in one month, Lessig said wealthy supporters would kick in another $1 million. The group raised its first $1 million by the middle of May.The big supporters providing the matching $1 million include LinkedIn CEO Reid Hoffman, venture capitalist and PayPal co-founder and president of Thiel Capital Peter Thiel, TED curator Chris Anderson, Union Square Ventures partners Brad Burnham and Fred Wilson, Women's Entrepreneurial Festival co-founder Joanne Wilson, and Schooner Capital founder Vin Ryan.""It's kind of a perfect mix of people,"" Lessig, a well-known reform advocate with close ties to Silicon Valley, told HuffPost.The name that stands out among the seven announced donors is that of Thiel, a well-known libertarian and Republican donor. In 2012, Thiel financed a super PAC supporting the presidential candidacy of former Republican Rep. Ron Paul of Texas. Thiel also was a major donor to the upstart campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who on Tuesday decried efforts to reform campaign finance to reduce the amount of money in politics.Thiel is best known for co-founding PayPal and for being the first outside investor in Facebook. He has donated to a series of conservative groups and causes, including the Club for Growth and conservative prankster James O'Keefe. But as a libertarian, Thiel supports gay marriage and the legalization of marijuana, among other socially liberal issues. He has recently taken the unorthodox position -- at least among vocal conservatives -- of supporting an increase in the minimum wage. Thiel argues that a higher minimum wage would mean fewer people dependent on government programs.Support from Thiel for Lessig's campaign to reform campaign finance laws is not only eyebrow-raising because of his libertarian politics -- the Libertarian Party has called for the repeal of all campaign finance laws since at least the 1970s -- but also because of a political treatise he penned in 2009 declaring, ""I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible."" This belief, whether Thiel still holds it, would seem to conflict with the rejuvenation of democracy that Lessig and campaign finance reformers hope to achieve. Still, Lessig said, ""I do think that he's deeply committed that something fundamental has to change.""Lessig's project got off the ground before the crowd funding began, thanks to Thiel and Hoffman. Hoffman worked with Thiel as a former PayPal employee. According to Lessig, the Mayday PAC plan for 2014 prepared by a consulting firm run by former White House official and pro-Obama super PAC head Bill Burton was paid for by the two Silicon Valley billionaires.Hoffman, for his part, has emerged as a major Democratic Party donor in recent years, giving $1 million to the pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA Action and tens of thousands more to political candidates since 2012.The other donors to the Mayday PAC either have little donor profile or also give to the Democratic Party and its candidates. Some, though, are known for getting behind winning investments. Union Square Ventures, founded by Fred Wilson and Brad Burnham, put money behind Twitter, Tumblr and Zynga early in their development.Only Vin Ryan, the Boston-based billionaire investor, has a history of supporting campaign finance reform, having given $500,000 to the Friends of Democracy super PAC launched by investor Jonathan Soros.Lessig previously told HuffPost that it was important to develop a bipartisan cast of supporters to reflect public backing for reform -- high among members of both parties.The super PAC is now on to its next round of crowd funding, with the goal of raising $5 million from donations of $10,000 or less to be matched by another round of yet-to-be-named big-dollar donors."

Ernst emerged victorious from a multi-candidate field. She will face Rep. Bruce Braley (D-Iowa) in November, in the race to succeed retiring Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa). Appel ran unopposed in her House race for retiring Republican Rep. Tom Latham's seat. Both Ernst and Appel have excited national women's groups. Ernst has been endorsed by RightNOW Women PAC, a group aiming to recruit more women to be active within Republican politics. Appel has the backing of Emily's List, a Democratic group that works to elect women candidates. West Virginia also has never elected a female senator, though that will change in November, as Secretary of State Natalie Tennant (D) and Rep.
