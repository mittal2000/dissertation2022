Seaman NEW YORK | Mon Mar 4, 2013 12:07am EST(Reuters Health) - Nearly a third of people diagnosed as children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) still have the condition in adulthood, according to a large new study that also found they're more likely to develop other mental disorders and to commit suicide.U.S. researchers who published their findings in Pediatrics on Monday found that about 29 percent of participants in the study who were diagnosed with ADHD as children ended up carrying that diagnosis into their late twenties.""They still clearly had symptoms that continued to be consistent with that diagnosis. But that in itself has been an area of difficulty and controversy,"" said the study's lead author, Dr. William Barbaresi, from Boston Children's Hospital.ADHD, which is the most common neuro-developmental condition, affects between 3 percent and 7 percent of American school children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It's more common in boys than girls.The CDC says kids with ADHD tend to have a hard time paying attention, to be forgetful, fidget and be easily distracted, to the point that it creates problems at school, at home and with their friends.Until now, most studies looking at ADHD in children and adults used data that's known to be unreliable, or information from people with severe forms of the disorder, according to the new report.For their study - which Barbaresi started while at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota - the researchers followed 5,718 children who were born in that area between 1976 and 1982. Of those, 367 were diagnosed with ADHD as children and gave the researchers access to their medical records.Barbaresi and his colleagues then invited the participants to be reevaluated when they were about 29 years old.Overall, 232 of the childhood ADHD patients agreed to be part of the study as adults, and the researchers found that 68 still had the disorder - about 29 percent.But even those participants whose ADHD diagnosis did not persist into adulthood were still more likely to suffer from at least one psychiatric condition other than ADHD.The researchers found that 57 percent of childhood ADHD patients had at least one psychiatric condition as adults - most commonly alcohol or substance abuse, anxiety and depression - compared to 35 percent of the people in a comparison group who did not have ADHD while growing up.People diagnosed with ADHD as children were also more likely to commit suicide by the time of the follow-up study.The researchers found that 3 of the 367 participants with childhood ADHD had committed suicide, compared to just 7 of 4,946 non-ADHD participants.""The finding about suicide is new. It was suggested in another one of these longitudinal studies, but in this study the sample size was large enough for it to be significant,"" said Mary Solanto, director of the ADHD Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York.Solanto, who was not involved in the new research, said many of the study's other findings have been seen in previous studies. ""What's new is that this is larger and the subjects were drawn from the general population,"" she added.The study's authors caution, however, that their findings may not apply to children across the U.S., because their study participants were from mostly white, middle-class families in one area of Minnesota.""It is possible, if not likely, that the magnitude of the adverse outcomes … would be even greater in populations with additional challenges such as higher rates of poverty,"" they write.Barbaresi told Reuters Health that this study is a ""high-level"" view of some of the most serious outcomes. He said additional studies with more results will be published later.But despite these findings, Solanto said ADHD does not have to be a barrier to success.""There are a lot of people who have had it that learned to cope and deal with it. But in order for that to happen, it's important to diagnose and treat it as soon as possible,"" she said.""The focus needs to be on this condition, because it a serious health problem and we're not treating this way,"" Barbaresi said.SOURCE: bit.ly/HjQ8dI Pediatrics, online March 4, 2013.Copyright 2012 Thomson Reuters.

You'll see up front what different plans are likely to cost you and have the opportunity to enroll in the plan you decide is right for you. Should you need help sorting through your options, there will now be people available to assist you.To help you, your family, friends, and neighbors get ready for enrollment in a plan that you choose through the Health Insurance Marketplace, you can find out more and sign up for email and text updates by visiting https://signup.healthcare.gov/.The Affordable Care Act also gives you greater control over the care you receive. By requiring insurers to provide you with an easy-to-understand summary of your health plan's benefits and coverage -- including a glossary of insurance terms -- you will have the information you need to evaluate your options.The health care law prohibits some of the worst insurance industry practices that have kept affordable health coverage out of reach for millions of Americans when they needed it most. For example, in the past, insurance companies could deny you coverage because you were sick or had a pre-existing condition. Starting in 2014, the law makes it illegal for insurance companies to deny you coverage because of a pre-existing condition. New protections applicable to most plans beginning in 2014 will also prevent insurance companies from charging you more because of your gender or occupation.Because of the law, it's already illegal for insurance companies to deny coverage to children under age 19 because of a pre-existing condition, or to cancel your coverage because you made an honest mistake on your application. The law also ensures your right to appeal health insurance plan decisions.In addition, insurance companies can no longer put a lifetime dollar limit on most of the benefits you receive and starting in 2014, insurers will be prohibited from imposing annual dollar limits.The law also prevents insurance companies from raising your premium rates without accountability or transparency. The law requires insurance companies in every state to publicly provide easy-to-understand information to their customers about their reasons for significant rate increases, and any unreasonable rate increases are posted online. We know this is working. The number of requests for insurance premium increases of 10 percent or more has dropped dramatically, from 75 percent to 14 percent.This rate review program works in conjunction with the 80/20 rule, which requires insurance companies to generally spend 80 percent of premiums on health care (rather than CEO salaries and marketing) or provide rebates to their customers. Insurance companies that did not meet the 80/20 rule have provided nearly 13 million Americans with more than $1.1 billion in rebates. Americans receiving the rebate have benefited from an average rebate of $151 per household. Many elements of the Affordable Care Act protect consumers and make the health insurance market work better for individuals, families, and small businesses. Because of the Affordable Care Act, more Americans than ever before will have access to quality health insurance they can afford."

Jeremy Bush told rescue crews he heard a loud crash near midnight Thursday, then heard his brother screaming. There's been no contact with Jeff Bush since then, and neighbors on both sides of the home have been evacuated.

It's a question that's been on many minds lately, following the news that a sinkhole had opened suddenly beneath a home not far from Tampa, Fla. last Thursday and swallowed up a man who lived there. As the name suggests, sinkholes are naturally occurring holes in the surface of the earth. Sinkholes can form gradually or -- as in the tragic case in Florida -- suddenly. They form in areas where water flowing underground has dissolved rock -- typically limestone -- below the surface, leading to the formation of underground voids into which the surface sediment falls, according to the website of the Florida Sinkhole Research Institute. They vary in size from 1 to 600 meters.Sinkholes are found all over the world. In the U.S., sinkholes are especially common in Texas, Alabama, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and Florida, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.Experts say that thousands of sinkholes form in Florida each year, the Associated Press reported. In addition to sitting on highly porous limestone, the state has additional factors that can lead to the formation of sinkholes, including extreme weather and aquifer pumping.""There's hardly a place in Florida that's immune to sinkholes,"" Sandy Nettles, the owner of a geology consulting company in the Tampa area, told the Associated Press. In an effort to prevent injuries, deaths, and property losses caused by sinkholes, scientists have tested various methods of detecting the underground cavities that can lead to sinkholes. These include radar, seismography, and electrical resistivity testing, according to the institute's website. You don't have to be a scientist to be able to recognize certain signs that a sinkhole is about to open up. A brochure issued by the Southwest Florida Water Management District lists several sinkhole warning signs, including slumping trees or fence posts; the formation of small ponds in areas where water has not collected before; wilting of small, circular areas of vegetation; and structural cracks in walls.But despite efforts to spot sinkholes before they occur, there are still plenty of unpleasant -- and occasionally tragic -- surprises. Said Settles, ""There's no way of ever predicting where a sinkhole is going to occur."""

Maybe Jay Leno isn't the Freddy Krueger of late night after all. If The Hollywood Reporter's sources are correct, his reign at 11:35 p.m. may finally be coming to a close... for real this time.THR is reporting that, according to ""two high-level industry sources,"" NBC will announce in May that Jimmy Fallon is replacing Leno in 2014. While the network still denies the rumor as ""categorically untrue"" -- the possible change was first reported last December -- the sources explained the rationale is in part the result of stiffer competition for a younger audience.Sources believe the network will bring in Fallon partly out of concern about the competition on ABC, which moved younger-skewing Jimmy Kimmel to the 11:35 time slot in January.... Leno's 'Tonight' still performs well for NBC, regularly besting his late-night rivals. But Kimmel is competitive in the 18-49 demo.With NBC falling to an unprecedented fifth place, the network is likely to put all options on the table. Moving Fallon to the coveted spot may allow NBC to fight demographic fire with fire. Both Fallon and Kimmel have found ways to give their shows life beyond their time slot by creating segments that seem custom-made for Internet sharing. Kimmel's show got a boost from the one-two punch of ""F*cking Matt Damon"" and ""F*cking Ben Affleck,"" while Fallon has spun viral gold with comedy bits like Neil Young singing ""Pants On The Ground"" and memorable guest segments such as the recent ""Evolution Of Mom Dancing"" with Michelle Obama.Of course, this news raises several questions. First and foremost, ""Is this for real?"" Second, will Fallon move production to Los Angeles or stay in New York to avoid he and his staff getting Conan'd? Third, and perhaps most importantly, if Fallon goes to ""The Tonight Show,"" who takes over the ""Late Night"" slot?If you're betting, we'd say put your money somewhere in Tina Fey's general vicinity. After all, she signed a four-year contract with NBC late last year.""Late Night With Tina & Amy""?

The Nobel Prize-winning economist and New York Times columnist wrote in a blog post Sunday that lawmakers shouldn’t be pushing for a Grand Bargain on the budget because even if they reached one, Republicans leaders would soon renege and demand more. “In a year — or more likely in a minute or two — Republicans would be back, demanding more tax cuts and more cuts in social programs,” he wrote. “They just won’t take yes for an answer.”In his post, Krugman commends The Washington Post's Ezra Klein for admitting in a recent piece that he was wrong to assume that Republicans would agree to a budget deal with President Barack Obama if they knew how much the president was willing to put on the table. A post by New York Magazine’s Jonathan Chait as well as a recent Twitter exchange ultimately convinced Klein that even if Obama meets their demands, they’ll just demand more. Obama failed to reach an agreement with Republican leaders to avert the billions in across-the-board spending cuts, known as the sequester, that took effect Friday. At issue: Obama wanted to stop the sequester through a budget deal that involved a combination of spending cuts and tax hikes and Republicans have said time and time again that they won’t raise taxes. Obama urged Congress to come to a deal Saturday, saying that Americans are tired of seeing the country “careen from one manufactured crisis to another.” On Sunday Republican leaders disagreed on the effects of the sequester on the nation’s economy. Speaker of the House John Boehner called them “silly” and “random.” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell described the cuts as “modest” while criticizing Washington’s “spending addiction.” Krugman has criticized Republicans’ approach to budget negotiations before. He called the GOP’s strategy of insisting on spending cuts before agreeing to raise the country’s borrowing limit “hostage taking.” He’s also said taking a Grand Bargain approach to the country’s fiscal problems is “just an attempt to create facts on the ground for future confrontations.” CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated Mitch McConnell's title. He is the Senate minority leader."

But federal law allows them to share files,2013-03-03,"In this photo taken Wednesday, Feb. 23, 2011, Lindsay Ehlers teaches math to her fourth grade class at Liberty Lake Elementary School in Liberty Lake Washington. While their students can earn anything from an A to an F for their school performance, nearly every American teacher gets one of two grades unsatisfactory or meets expectations and almost all earn a passing grade. That is about to change in Washington and many other states where more nuanced teacher evaluation systems are being developed, at least partly in response to the federal Race to the Top competition for school dollars. (AP Photo/Nick Geranios)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb3617b3c000020010c5fa6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Stephanie Simon(Reuters) - An education technology conference this week in Austin, Texas, will clang with bells and whistles as startups eagerly show off their latest wares.But the most influential new product may be the least flashy: a $100 million database built to chart the academic paths of public school students from kindergarten through high school.In operation just three months, the database already holds files on millions of children identified by name, address and sometimes social security number. Learning disabilities are documented, test scores recorded, attendance noted. In some cases, the database tracks student hobbies, career goals, attitudes toward school - even homework completion.Local education officials retain legal control over their students' information. But federal law allows them to share files in their portion of the database with private companies selling educational products and services.Entrepreneurs can't wait.""This is going to be a huge win for us,"" said Jeffrey Olen, a product manager at CompassLearning, which sells education software.CompassLearning will join two dozen technology companies at this week's SXSWedu conference in demonstrating how they might mine the database to create custom products - educational games for students, lesson plans for teachers, progress reports for principals.The database is a joint project of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which provided most of the funding, the Carnegie Corporation of New York and school officials from several states. Amplify Education, a division of Rupert Murdoch's News Corp, built the infrastructure over the past 18 months. When it was ready, the Gates Foundation turned the database over to a newly created nonprofit, inBloom Inc, which will run it.States and school districts can choose whether they want to input their student records into the system; the service is free for now, though inBloom officials say they will likely start to charge fees in 2015. So far, seven states - Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Illinois, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Massachusetts - have committed to enter data from select school districts. Louisiana and New York will be entering nearly all student records statewide.""We look at personalized learning as the next big leap forward in education,"" said Brandon Williams, a director at the Illinois State Board of Education.IF DATA LEAKS, WHAT REMEDIES?Federal officials say the database project complies with privacy laws. Schools do not need parental consent to share student records with any ""school official"" who has a ""legitimate educational interest,"" according to the Department of Education. The department defines ""school official"" to include private companies hired by the school, so long as they use the data only for the purposes spelled out in their contracts.The database also gives school administrators full control over student files, so they could choose to share test scores with a vendor but withhold social security numbers or disability records.That's hardly reassuring to many parents.""Once this information gets out there, it's going to be abused. There's no doubt in my mind,"" said Jason France, a father of two in Louisiana.While inBloom pledges to guard the data tightly, its own privacy policy states that it ""cannot guarantee the security of the information stored ... or that the information will not be intercepted when it is being transmitted.""Parents from New York and Louisiana have written state officials in protest. So have the Massachusetts chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union and Parent-Teacher Association. If student records leak, are hacked or abused, ""What are the remedies for parents?"" asked Norman Siegel, a civil liberties attorney in New York who has been working with the protestors. ""It's very troubling.""VENTURE CAPITAL MAGNETFans of the project respond that the files are safer in the database than scattered about school districts. Plus, they say, the potential upside is enormous, with the power to transform classrooms across the U.S.Does Johnny have trouble converting decimals to fractions? The database will have recorded that - and may have recorded as well that he finds textbooks boring, adores animation and plays baseball after school. Personalized learning software can use that data to serve up a tailor-made math lesson, perhaps an animated game that uses baseball statistics to teach decimals.Johnny's teacher can watch his development on a ""dashboard"" that uses bright graphics to map each of her students' progress on dozens, even hundreds, of discrete skills.""You can start to see what's effective for each particular student,"" said Adria Moersen, a high school teacher in Colorado who has tested some of the new products.The sector is undeniably hot; technology startups aimed at K-12 schools attracted more than $425 million in venture capital last year, according to the NewSchools Venture Fund, a nonprofit that focuses on the sector. The investment company GSV Advisors tracked 84 deals in the sector last year, up from 15 in 2007.In addition to its $100 million investment in the database, the Gates Foundation has pledged $70 million in grants to schools and companies to develop personalized learning tools.New products regularly come to market, but both educators and entrepreneurs say adoption has been slow because of technical hurdles.WARNING SYSTEMS TO FORESTALL DROPOUTS?Schools tend to store different bits of student information in different databases, often with different operating systems. That makes it clunky to integrate new learning apps into classrooms.At the Rocketship chain of charter schools, for instance, administrators must manually update at least five databases to keep their education software running smoothly when a child transfers from one teacher to another, said Charlie Bufalino, a Rocketship executive.The extra steps add expense, which limits how many apps a school can buy. And because the data is so fragmented, the private companies don't always get a robust picture of each student's academic performance, much less their personal characteristics.The new database aims to wipe away those obstacles by integrating all student information - including data that may previously have been stored in paper files or teacher gradebooks - in a single, flexible platform.Education technology companies can use the same platform to design their software, so their programs will hook into a rich trove of student data if a district or state authorizes access.That prospect has some companies dreaming big.Larry Berger, an executive at Amplify Education, says the data could be mined to develop ""early warning systems."" Perhaps it will turn out, for instance, that most high school dropouts began to struggle with math at age 8. If so, all future 8-year-olds fitting that pattern could be identified and given extra help.Companies with access to the database will also be able to identify struggling teachers and pinpoint which concepts their students are failing to master. One startup that could benefit: BloomBoard, which sells schools professional development plans customized to each teacher.The new database ""is a godsend for us,"" said Jason Lange, the chief executive of BloomBoard. ""It allows us to collect more data faster, quicker and cheaper.""Whether all this data, and all the programs that use it, will transform education is another question. Most data-driven software has only been tested on a small scale; results are often mixed.Though he is bullish on the sector, Michael Moe, the chief investment officer at GSV Capital, cautions that there is as yet no proof the new technology will produce ""game-changing outcomes"" for students - or, for that matter, sterling profits for investors.Others are more skeptical still.""The hype in the tech press is that education is an engineering problem that can be fixed by technology,"" said Frank Catalano of Intrinsic Strategy, a consulting firm focused on education and technology. ""To my mind, that's a very naive and destructive view.""(Reporting by Stephanie Simon; editing by Prudence Crowther)"

Despite many lengthy conspiracy theories to the contrary, a new report from HitFix has revealed that the plot for ""Tomorrowland,"" Lindelof's upcoming collaboration with director Brad Bird and star George Clooney, is much more complicated than mere UFOs.According to Drew McWeeny, who got his hands on a casting breakdown, the plot for ""Tomorrowland"" is as follows:""A teenage girl, a genius middle-aged man (who was kicked out of Tomorrowland) and a pre-pubescent girl robot attempt to get to and unravel what happened to Tomorrowland, which exists in an alternative dimension, in order to save Earth.""That's a big change from what many had expected, especially after Disney expert Jim Hill, who also blogs for The Huffington Post, speculated that the top secret plot of ""Tomorrowland"" could have something to do with alien contact and Walt Disney's involvement. Wrote Hill in early February: ""During the mid-1950s, the U.S. government supposedly approached Walt Disney and then asked for his help in producing a TV show that would eventually be used to break the news to the American public that UFOS are real.""Lindelof, however, had previously discounted the idea of aliens being involved in ""Tomorrowland,"" writing in January: ""We won't tell you what it's about (yet), but we will tell you what it's NOT about. And that would be ALIENS.""If the circulated logline is accurate -- and not further misdirection, which McWeeny stresses is possible -- that would set ""Tomorrowland"" up as some mix of ""A.I."" ""Super 8"" and the TV series ""Fringe."" Clooney would play the ""middle-aged man,"" with the young roles yet to be cast. Hugh Laurie has been set as the film's antagonist.For more on Laurie's role, as well as what to expect from ""Tomorrowland,"" head over to HitFix.

(AP Photo/PRNewsFoto/AG Interactive, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb41aa72200004301dc0477.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Tomorrow, Mark Burnett and his wife, the star of Touched by an Angel, Roma Downey, will debut their much talked about TV series, The Bible, and Hollywood will closely watch the numbers to see how the series will perform for its home, The History Channel. Several months ago I got a sneak peek at an hour and a half or so of the series and enjoyed a wonderful afternoon of catered food at the couple's beautiful home. As I did, several thoughts came to mind: First, I admire their fervent desire to retell the Bible stories that have influenced the civilized world, and use the positions they've both attained in Hollywood to attempt to do good things. For this they are to be commended and it will be a good thing for American popular culture if the ratings go through the roof and TV executives, obsessed with numbers, can see just how starved average Americans are for meaningful TV, giving the couple opportunities to do more projects like this one. And when and if that happens, it's my hope that this wonderful and well-intentioned couple will go back and carefully study The Passion of the Christ. Mel Gibson's epic film has been accused by its critics of many things, but boring was never one of them. Since they are often approved by various ecclesiastical committees before going into production, Bible films tend to be dry, boring and wooden with characters with bad hair who speak in stilted English and often with British accents. But The Passion changed all of that and because it was made with such a strong commitment to artistry, it held the attention of viewers in a way that could never be said about Jesus of Nazareth, The Jesus Film or even Ben Hur. Gibson never forgot that Bible characters were human, and made a movie that never let us forget that. For me the most memorable example of this was when Jesus, played by Jim Caviezel, was asked by his mother to set the table. Of course, I thought to myself when I first watched that scene, it was a perfectly natural thing for a mother to do-to ask her son to set the table for dinner. Then, when Jesus splashed a bit of water on her, I was once again reminded that he wasn't just the Savior of the world, but somebody's son. But that was a scene that happened only because the film's director refused to separate his own humanity from the work, something that I was powerfully reminded of when I asked Gibson about the water splashing scene. One day, during the film's editing (I produced the inspired by rock soundtrack) I asked him: ""That's you isn't it?"" ""Who do you think wrote it?"" he retorted, as though I was the dumbest rock on the planet. Another time, after a screening, a pastor wanted to know why Satan had a baby on his shoulder. At first, Gibson responded that he created the character because Satan often liked to copy God and since God had a son, he decided to give Satan one. What verse in what chapter of what book of the Bible did it say that Satan had such a child, the pastor demanded. Exasperated, Gibson responded: ""I just pulled it out of my a--!"" There is a possibility that The Bible will be met by a collective national yawn. That would be a shame. There is also the possibility that it will do solid numbers that are not so much a verdict on the quality of the work, but rather an affirmation of the producers' intentions with the hope that they'll make more such dramas and make them better. For the most important lesson of The Passion, was not that people are clamoring to watch faithfully pedantic retellings of Bible stories, but that some of the greatest stories ever told deserve to be told with an artistic flair that while staying faithful to those stories, never forget to put their creators' own humanity into the work, remembering the admonition: entertain first, send a message second."

His comments on Beyonce led into a performance of ""Meat is Murder,"" the title track off of The Smith's 1985 album.Morrissey's steadfast commitment to vegetarianism, and his overwhelming encouragement that others abide by the same values, has led to his recent feuds with Kimmel and McCartney as well. Morrissey was set to appear on Kimmel's talkshow last week but canceled right before the show, citing the inclusion of the cast members of the television show ""Duck Dynasty"" in the episode as his reason for doing so. Morrissey released a statement explaining that he ""cannot morally be on a television program where the cast members of 'Duck Dynasty' will also be guests."" The show ""Duck Dynasty"" focuses on duck hunting, a practice that Morrissey is against. ""As far as my reputation is concerned, I can't take the risk of being on a show alongside people who, in effect, amount to animal serial killers,"" he said.Morrissey's drama continued as he geared up for Friday's concert at Los Angeles' Staples Center. The singer managed to require that the venue go meat-free for his performance, leading to his next beef, this time with Sir Paul McCartney. ""I was amused to hear that [McCartney] was very angry that Staples had said yes to me but no to him, when really, he should be happy for any victory on behalf of the animals,"" Morrissey told THR. ""I know he works tirelessly for the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals [PETA], but he also loves the British royals, whose treatment of animals is abysmal. The Queen herself wears enough fur to blanket most of Russia. He also once sang ‘Give Ireland back to the Irish,’ which was directed at the Queen. Well, she refused, and she still refuses, yet Sir Paul gives her the thumbs up! If he cared passionately about animals, he’d return his knighthood.""While Kimmel took to his Twitter account to respond to Morrissey's statements, Beyonce has yet to comment. Bey's social media presence yesterday consisted of two new photos of the singer on her Instagram, wearing a flat-brim hat that reads simply, ""Beyond."""

But in addition to discovering new talent, the festival celebrates the old in a unique way. Successful filmmakers love their first films, and so, as a unique feature of this festival, Darren Aronofsky, Barbara Kopple, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Nancy Savoca, Hal Hartley, Christine Vachon, Melvin van Peeples, and Todd Solonz will show their debut work. On Friday night, Sofia Coppola screened The Virgin Suicides, with a Q&A that lasted twice the allotted time, illustrating that passion, First Fest co-founder Mandy Ward pointed out, surprised at how well this venture is going -- after only one day. (The festival ends with an awards ceremony on Monday night at the Players Club, with Johanna Bennett's father Tony, Ellen Burstyn, Martin Scorsese, and others.)The panel in question, with Jenny Lumet, Frida Torresblanco, and Harry Belafonte, was supposed to be about Women and Diversity in Film, but stayed closest to the subject of race. Jenny Lumet, a granddaughter of Lena Horne and daughter of Sidney Lumet, described her place in Hollywood: Subversive is a positive word and I am happy to do it any way I can. Frida Torresblanco, producer of Pan's Labyrinth, talked about the demographics of Latinos attending movies, and wanting to carve out a niche in Latin themed horror movies. The conversation quickly went to what might be called the history of optimism in America -- and what has led to some disillusionment. Elegant, eloquent, and wise at 86, Belafonte spoke about marching with Martin Luther King, Jr., the importance of Sidney Poitier's vision to Hollywood, and how inspiring missions become mainstream, commodified, and commercial. His speech, impromptu and focused on the need for active commitment to justice, was a breathtaking history, and it also had the feel of a historic moment.A version of this post also appears on Gossip Central."

Best known for her novel Jane Eyre, Brontë also wrote hundreds of poems during her lifetime. But an original manuscript in private hands is a rarity, and collectors are flocking to it. This despite the fact that the poem is, literally, quite small: Brontë, curiously, inscribed it on a 3 x 3-inch piece of paper.Thankfully, the full text of the poem is available online (though it's mistakenly included in a collection of poems by Charlotte's sister Emily). Its subject is thoroughly Romantic: a young woman reflecting on the beauty and power in nature. It's reminiscent of Byron and Wordsworth -- two of Brontë's influences -- and the final image of the nightingale could come from Keats.  I've been wandering in the greenwoods, And 'mid flowery, smiling plains; I've been listening to the dark floods, To the thrush's thrilling strains.I have gathered the pale primrose, And the purple violet sweet; I've been where the asphodel grows, And where lives the red deer fleet.I've been to the distant mountain,  To the silver singing rill, By the crystal murm'ring fountain, And the shady, verdant hill.I've been where the poplars springing From the fair enamelled ground, While the nightingale is singing With a solemn, plaintive sound.Considering that Brontë was just thirteen when she wrote these lines, they're remarkably accomplished. But this is a Brontë sister after all.The Yorkshire Post speculates that a scarcity of paper necessitated the poem's small size (and it certainly helped that the Brontë sisters were nearsighted). But organizers doubt that size will affect the bidding. One of the Brontë's notebooks brought in £900,000 at auction last year, and this little poem is expected to net a big, big haul of £40,000 to £45,000."

While the chances of costing one's franchise a decade of competitive viability are lower in these post-Lockout days, $25-$30 million for a rookie bust is more than a hiccup on the way to a dynasty. Despite a league-wide history of epic miscalculations, the guys with the stopwatches and measuring tapes still get stars in their eyes over impressive physical specimens. The difference between Olympic medalists and their closest competitors is not physical; it is mental (Kerri Strug anyone?). Is there a links-lover anywhere who thinks that Tiger Woods became the best golfer in the world by virtue of a magical swing? A swing that he has completely overhauled about ten times? At the highest level of competition in any sport, athletic skill is not enough. Nothing in the world can take the place of persistence. Talent will not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent ... Persistence and determination alone are omnipotent. -Calvin CoolidgeFootball, that toughest and most physical of all sports, acknowledges in a somewhat anecdotal way that mental preparedness can provide the winning edge. Players and teams with ""swagger"" can carry the day over opponents generally viewed to be superior in ability. Just ask the New York Giants.An article in Athletic Insight maintains ""there appears to be a shift away from seeing work in this domain as mainly problem focused and towards it being opportunity focused."" So why have only a handful of colleges incorporated professionally led mental conditioning into their programs? Athletes' Performance Vice President of Mindset Programs, Trevor Moawad, presents this scenario:You're a top college football coach. You go into your Athletic Director's office to solicit the funds for adding a formal mental conditioning component to your multi-million dollar program. You tell the Director that this will help improve focus, team Gestalt, coachablity and life management skills, leading to improved performance on the field, in the classroom and in life. And the Athletic Director looks right back at you and says, ""Isn't that your job?""Dr. Lowell Wightman, adjunct professor at Colorado State University's School of Education and author of the Master Coaching curriculum, is dedicated to increasing the collegiate supporters. He believes that the future of college football demands ""closing the gap between coach and educator."" Mental conditioning can increase graduation percentages in addition to winning percentages as improved communication skills and the ability to increase psychological resiliency inform both on- and off-the-field performance. Wightman is launching a multi-year study designed to supply the hard numbers required by those in charge of university budgets. For the moment, mindset training is more valued by agents and other professionals charged with shepherding NFL aspirants through the Draft gauntlet. Athletes' Performance is at the top of the food chain when it comes to preparing NFL prospects for the grueling January-April selection process. Mental conditioning isn't bringing in a Navy Seal the night of the big game to motivate your team to greatness. While valuable and inspirational, those talks tend to have the memory lifespan of last Sunday's sermon. Mindset preparedness as a permanent part of athletic performance training involves exactly the same discipline, practice and reinforcement as position drills. Moawad maintains, ""Your mind is an asset."" Perhaps with the caveat: ""If property trained.""Coaches at every level stress repetition: guide the athlete to finding the optimum way to start a sprint, run a route, execute a touch-pass, tackle a power back. Rinse and repeat. Again and again until their muscles fall naturally into the correct actions. Part of mental conditioning is practicing a relentlessly positive mindset that focuses on believing in one's own competence. Believing that those endless physical reps have ensured that the body knows exactly what to do. How logical. Why does this seem easier to say than to do in the middle of Lucas Oil Field with every owner, coach and scout in the NFL universe staring at you, holding their clipboards and your future? Nick Winkelman, the Director of Training Systems and Education at Athletes' Performance's Phoenix facility, has a mission to make his NFL hopefuls prepared for ""the immensity of the moment."" He and his colleagues employ training techniques based on Self Determination Theory. Developed by Edward L. Deci and Richard M. Ryan at the University of Rochester, SDT is a theory of motivation that emphasizes social connectedness with peers, a confidence in one's own autonomous capability and a system of self-advocacy based on reinforcing a sense of individual efficacy. Mr. Moawad maintains that much of mindset training is ""common sense."" That habit defines you. That mental conditioning helps the young athletes to ""identify successful habits in those they respect and copy them."" That taking responsibility for one's own performance and becoming ""consciously competent"" is the foundation of success in the NFL Draft process and in an NFL career. All of which sounds like the kind of common sense that is ""not so common.""Any young man who has made it to the level of legitimate NFL prospect is no stranger to athletic success. However, undisciplined thinking and negative ""self-talk"" can sabotage a career -- and a life. According to Moawad, it takes ""ten positive experiences to counteract one negative thought."" Mental conditioning can reinforce those positive experiences and retrain the inner dialogue that could derail success.The mindset training component at Athletes' Performance runs through the program like a river of positive thinking. Coach Randall Coburn may be officially tasked with speed and movement training at AP's Florida branch, but he and colleague Anthony Hobgood experienced an exceptional level of success with their 2013 NFL Combine participants after instituting a recurring Saturday session based on the steps necessary to ""leave behind selfish boyish ways and become a man."" Coburn estimated that every day of Combine training included between five and ten elements of mindset work, though the athletes probably wouldn't have noticed or identified them as such.The emphasis on giving their athletes Combine and Pro Day experiences that contain virtually no surprises is a central goal in AP's program: preparing the future draftees for the physical drills, the team interviews, the media presence and the mental challenges leads ideally to a comfort level that frees the athletes to showcase their best selves under the NFL microscope. When asked by OT Terron Armstead for advice on which of the many available cleats to use for his first Combine day, Coburn responded with his own question, ""Which pair makes you feel the most comfortable?"" Armstead responded, ""The ones with my two daughters' names on them."" That choice may or may not have been a defining factor, but young Mr. Armstead established a new offensive lineman record in the 40-yard dash, put up 31 reps on the bench press and sprang 122 inches on his broad jump. For those who weren't glued to the television during offensive linemen drills, Mr. Armstead weighs 306 pounds. That's an impressive number of airborne inches for someone that size. Terron probably moved up at least one round in the April hiring event and has even started rumors that some teams may try him out at tight end. Armstead would probably agree that one can't overestimate the value of a comfort level based on both mind and body preparedness. According to Darin Gantt of NBCSports.com, ""He's at least gotten himself noticed, making whatever he spent on combine prep well worth it for his agent.""Special thanks to those who gave their time to be interviewed and to Peggy Iralson of Athletes' Performance for her help."
