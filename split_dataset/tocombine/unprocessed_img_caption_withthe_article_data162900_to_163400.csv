Its meaning is often fuddled, or expanded to include things such as flavor. The former refers only to taste buds, whereas the latter is a more all-encompassing sensory experience. Writes HowStuffWorks.com, ""with spicy food, the brain will even factor in pain as one aspect of flavor.""So trying to determine how something tastes is no small task. Determining how fat tastes poses a particular challenge for both flavor scientists and food companies such as Nestle or Yoplait, which specialize in making fat-free snacks taste rich and creamy. Until recently, the process used to determine the taste of fat was more archaic ritual than reliable science -- it involved human test subjects describing the bumpiness of the roofs of their mouths. Now, a new, more technical method has been created, and it allows scientists to hear the way things taste. Edible Geography describes the technology, invented by scientist George A. Van Aken, thusly:Van Aken took a tiny contact microphone, packed it in polyethylene to keep it dry, and secured it behind a test subject’s upper front incisor teeth in order to record the acoustic signal produced by the varying vibrations of their papillae as their tongue rubbed against their palate.Pretty cool, right? The implications are even more interesting: Smithsonian writes that this technology could allow artificial foods, such as vegan cheese, to mimic not only the taste but the texture of real cheese.

There have been 12 confirmed cases worldwide - including in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Britain - and so far six patients have died.""This patient had an underlying condition that may have made them more susceptible to respiratory infections,"" the Health Protection Agency said in a statement announcing the death of one of four people in Britain with the NCoV infection.NCoV was identified when the World Health Organisation issued an international alert in September 2012, saying a completely new virus had infected a Qatari man in Britain who had recently been in Saudi Arabia.Since then 12 cases have been identified, including a cluster of cases reported last week in a family in Britain.The HPA said it had identified and followed up more than 100 people who had close contact with the cases in this family cluster.""Besides the identified secondary cases, all tests carried out on contacts to date have been negative for the novel coronavirus infection,"" it said.Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that includes those that cause the common cold as well as the one that caused SARS - which emerged in China in 2002 and killed about a 10th of the 8,000 people it infected worldwide.

There have been 12 confirmed cases worldwide - including in Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Britain - and five patients have died.In one of the first published studies about NCoV, which was unknown in humans until it was identified in September 2012, researchers said it could penetrate the lining of passageways in the lungs and evade the immune system as easily as a cold virus can.This shows it ""grows very efficiently"" in human cells and suggests it is well-equipped for infecting humans, said Volker Thiel of the Institute of Immunobiology at Kantonal Hospital in Switzerland, who led the study.NCoV was identified when the World Health Organisation issued an international alert in September saying a completely new virus had infected a Qatari man in Britain who had recently been in Saudi Arabia.Coronaviruses are a family of viruses that includes those that cause the common cold as well as the one that caused SARS - which emerged in China in 2002 and killed about a 10th of the 8,000 people it infected worldwide.Symptoms of both NCoV and SARS include severe respiratory illness, fever, coughing and breathing difficulties. Of the 12 cases confirmed so far, four were in Britain, one was a Qatari patient in Germany, two were in Jordan and five in Saudi Arabia. POSSIBLE TREATMENTScientists are not sure where the virus comes from, but say one possibility is it came from animals. Experts at Britain's Health Protection Agency say preliminary scientific analysis suggests its closest relatives are bat coronaviruses.What is also unclear is what the true prevalence of the virus is - since it is possible that the 12 cases seen so far are the most severe, and there may be more people who have contracted the virus with milder symptoms so are not picked up.""We don't know whether the cases (so far) are the tip of the iceberg, or whether many more people are infected without showing severe symptoms,"" said Thiel, who worked with a team of scientists from the Netherlands, Switzerland, Germany and Denmark. ""We don't have enough cases to have a full picture of the variety of symptoms.""Thiel said that although the virus may have jumped from animals to humans very recently, his research showed it was just as well adapted to infecting the human respiratory tract as other coronaviruses like SARS and the common cold viruses.The study, published in mBio, an online journal of the American Society for Microbiology, also found that NCoV was susceptible to treatment with interferons, medicines that boost the immune system and which are also successfully used to treat other viral diseases like Hepatitis C.This opens up a possible mode of treatment in the event of a large-scale outbreak, the scientists said.Thiel said that with the future of the virus uncertain, it was vital for laboratories and specialists around the world to cooperate swiftly to find out more about where it came from, how widespread it was, and how infectious it might be.""So far it looks like the virus is well contained, so in that sense I don't see any reason for increased fear,"" he said.

5,DIVORCE,The 5 Worst Mistakes We Make During A Divorce,"Dr. Jeff Gardere, Contributor

In fact, a divorce can become such a complicated and nasty affair that many people have joked that a spouse dying is a less stressful event because at least you don't have to fight the deceased in court!",2013-02-18,Frustrated young man sitting after having an argument with his wife in bedroom,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd1e32200005700d96411.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Divorce can be one of the most stressful events in life, second only to a spouse dying. In fact, a divorce can become such a complicated and nasty affair that many people have joked that a spouse dying is a less stressful event because at least you don't have to fight the deceased in court!The point to be made here is that during this time of stress and duress we are no longer thinking with our brains, but instead with our hearts. Normally a pure heart will win the day, but a heart which is ruled by the pain, sadness and anger of a divorce will exhibit pure emotion -- often in an illogical and dangerous fashion.In the lead-up to a divorce, many people fail to prepare themselves emotionally and focus mainly on the legal side of the process. This, in turn, makes it difficult for them to control their emotions, setting the stage for even well-intentioned partners to make serious mistakes during the divorce process. With that in mind, we now turn to a quick survey of the five worst mistakes we make in a divorce. 1) Refusing to throw in the towel You should make every attempt to save your marriage. That may include going on another honeymoon, re-engaging in romance, making love much more often, going to dinners and talking and getting couples counseling. But after having made these attempts, if your soon-to-be-ex insists on the divorce, and even refuses to go to couples counseling, then you must let go! It takes two to tango, and certainly takes two to try to save the marriage. You just can't do it alone. 2) Giving in to withdrawal pains It's very hard to start a new chapter without a partner that has played a large part in your life, either positively or negatively, for quite a while. We are creatures of habit and it can be difficult to live without that person. We use the term ""withdrawal pains"" because the habit-forming properties of an intense relationship are similar to those associated with a drug habit. An individual experiencing these withdrawal pains will send constant e-mails, texts, or make repeated phone calls to their ex. This is very ill-advised, though -- while it may not be your intention, your former spouse may view this as harassment. Courts don't like harassment. 3) Dating too early While going through the divorce process, some people medicate with alcohol, some with drugs, and many more through sex and dating. You will certainly feel either lonely or liberated after a divorce, but either way you will want to hook up with someone to get you through this very difficult time, or just to plug the emotional void your partner once filled. It is only natural to get out there and shake your moneymaker. In reality, though, it is simply much too soon to begin dating; you are experiencing too many emotions, and that new person will most likely be collateral damage. You may also put yourself in more emotional peril by making decisions while you are in a state of emotional imbalance. 4) Putting the kids in the middle Everybody needs to have someone on their side, especially during a divorce. One of the biggest mistakes we make is dragging our kids into the divorce conflict, by either bad mouthing the other parent or making it difficult for the other parent to see the children. You know who wins here? No one. Everyone loses, especially the kids who may experience everything from parental alienation to depression and anger.5) Neglecting to get help Divorce is a difficult process, but it does not have to be a dirty word. The major reason that people find divorce to be so challenging is that they are unprepared for the tsunami of stress and emotion that comes along with it. As I wrote above, people tend not to put enough of a premium on their own emotions, instead choosing to focus on that of their children or their family. By consulting a professional or even opening up to a close friend, we can avoid the emotional anguish that is often associated with divorce.For more guidance on achieving an emotionally healthy divorce, download Dr. Jeff's new app, The Healthy Divorce, from Google Play or Apple's App Store."
