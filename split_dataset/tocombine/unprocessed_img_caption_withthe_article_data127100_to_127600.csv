Although they have seen it in movies and in TV shows, they tend to have a limited sense of how and why immigrants moved between different neighborhoods over time. Usually, they have no knowledge of the existence of the ""other"" Little Italies in the outer boroughs, let alone in places like Philadelphia or Providence. Above all, they are not familiar with the Italian-American culinary world, which they frequently perceive as merely a derivative interpretation of Italian food rather than a long and rich tradition. As I have discussed in this blog, my exposure to Italian-American food was very limited when I first came to the U.S. Some things looked and tasted very different, but I have grown to appreciate and respect this culinary heritage as an important component in the process of globalization of Italian cuisines, as I argue in my upcoming book Al Dente: A History of Italian Food. For those who are interested in these topics, The Italian American Table: Food, Family and Community in New York City provides great insight. Its author, Simone Cinotto -- a history professor at the University of Gastronomic Sciences in Bra, Italy -- focuses on the foodways of Italian immigrants in East Harlem during the 1920s and 1930s. Many New Yorkers are not aware of this area's Italian past, as its population is now mostly Hispanic. As Italians moved to the outer boroughs, African-Americans and Puerto Rican immigrants trickled in, creating the communities that still reside in those neighborhoods today. When the Italians migrated outward, they did so to leave the small and crowded apartments of the neighborhood, embracing the ideal of social mobility and one of its most beloved symbols: home ownership. They also did so to avoid getting confused with the newcomers, mostly people of color, as Italians had struggled for decades to assert their whiteness. This is particularly significant because Italian immigrants had themselves suffered from discrimination when they arrived in large numbers beginning in the late 1800s.Cinotto explains how educators and other administrative authorities used food and nutrition to try and fold Italians into the American mainstream. At the time, the traditional foodways of those newly migrated from Italy clashed with the widely accepted scientific theories that considered an abundance of vegetables and scarce consumption of meat and dairy to not be conducive to an active and healthy life as a productive member of American society. However, Italian-Americans were not limited by an absolute respect of the customs form the old world. As Cinotto clarifies, ""The symbolic and material 'stuff' from which ethnicity is created need not be rooted in an immemorial past to be authentic, but does need to be meaningful in the lived experiences of people in a group and useful in articulating the relations of power in which they are involved."" In the process of establishing an identity that could work in their new environment, food also played a role in building and enforcing borders and differences. Cinotto observed, ""Ethnic traditions were created by family members drawing selectively on and recasting old values and cultural features as a result of new economic and social realities, including relations with neighboring ethnic groups and emerging ideas about race and morality.""Italians adopted the same behaviors that, in the past, had been used to discriminate them with the goal of underscoring the lack of civility and culture of fresh waves of newcomers, looking for a better future just like they did a few decades before.Because of this, I really hope this book will be translated into Italian and become accessible to non-English speaking Italians. At this historical junction, Italy has become the destination for migrants from Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia. Despite the numbers are still quite limited, many Italians feel threatened in their cultural identity and economic privilege. As it often happens, food becomes the arena were these tensions are played out in everyday life. Grocery stores, stalls at the local markets, and ethnic restaurants opened and managed by immigrants are a source of suspicion. Their specialties and dishes may be fun for an occasional outing or for a party, but very little has been absorbed into the everyday diets of Italians. Who knows, maybe a greater awareness of the discrimination Italians had to endure when they were immigrants would engender reflections about the current situation. And as the Italian economy struggles to recover from the Eurozone crisis, Italians are migrating again. We can only hope history won't repeat itself, this time around."

Many women (my old self included!) are afraid of the weight room due to concerns around getting ""bulky"" or ""big."" Women tend to report that they would like to ""tone"" their muscles and spend hours doing cardio and lifting pink weights. Let's get the record straight: There is no such thing as ""toning muscles."" There is such thing as ""building lean muscle,"" but that cannot happen unless heavy enough weights are involved and muscles are fueled properly. Lifting and building lean muscle have dozens of benefits for women. These benefits include: more defined muscles, stronger bones, injury prevention AND increased calorie burn and fat loss. Studies show that women that lift weights regularly burn more calories both during and after their workout. Plus, each pound of lean muscle burns 35 to 50 more calories per hour than pound of fat. Too much cardio and you'll end up burning fat and some muscle -- not exactly what we're looking for! Women just simply do not produce enough testosterone to get big and bulky like men. So, when you see women bodybuilders that are really big, remember that those women lift full time, eat a TON and potentially use testosterone supplements (read: steroids). So, give it a try! Lifting really revolutionized my fitness ability, not to mention makes me feel powerful, strong and awesome after every workout.So with that said, here's the full-body workout that I did today. This workout is based on the NASM model of ""Muscular Endurance/Stabilization."" Stability is the basis of all exercise modalities. According to the National Academy of Sports Medicine, it is the ""body's ability to maintain postural equilibrium and support joints during movement."" This workout consists of supersets of stability exercises and strength exercises, challenging the same muscle group. Supersets are two exercises completed back to back, with no rest between. While completing this workout, engage your core to generate increased stability. Beginners: Choose a weight that allows you to complete 12 to 15 reps for two to three setsIntermediate: Choose a weight that allows you to complete 10 to 12 reps for three to four setsAdvanced: Choose a weight that allows you to complete eight to 10 reps for three to four setsAs always, warm up and cool down for five minutes on cardio machine of choice and rest one complete minute between sets.Superset #1: Single leg squat and row In-in-out-out (30 seconds, I used cones instead of a ladder)Superset #2: Flat bench flies Push-up on BOSUSuperset #3: Lat pull-down Assisted pull-upSuperset #4: Arnold press Single-leg scaptionSuperset #5: Bicep 21s Tricep dip with elevated feet BurpeeSuperset #6: Leg Press Pop squat on step (30s, as fast as you can)Photo credit: The Weighting Room."
