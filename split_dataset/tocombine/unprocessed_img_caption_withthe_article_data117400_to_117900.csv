David Kwiatkowski, who worked at the cardiac catheterization laboratory at Exeter Hospital, was charged with causing the outbreak, infecting more than 30 people. Records and interviews conducted by The Associated Press show that authorities could have halted Kwiatkowski's career four years ago, after he was fired from a Pittsburgh hospital. But he went on to work at 10 more hospitals, none of which knew about his history.

It now threatens the health of millions more.The discovery of the hepatitis C virus led to effective ways of reducing transmission and, more recently, to highly effective, life-saving treatments. But to truly eliminate hepatitis C in the U.S., these treatments must be used by everyone who needs them. Even as the nation grapples with how to ensure access to these treatments, another major challenge remains -- about half of the nearly three million Americans living with the virus have no idea they are infected.Hepatitis C infection initially has few noticeable symptoms. For years, even decades, it can slowly and silently damage the liver. Chronic hepatitis C can progress undetected to cirrhosis, liver cancer and other life-threatening conditions. Before widespread screening of the blood supply began in 1992, hepatitis C was the disease most frequently spread through blood transfusions -- yet many people infected this way are still unaware they are even at risk. In addition, others may have become infected from experimentation with drug use, even if only once decades ago. And the virus continues to spread, with an approximately 50 percent increase in new cases in just two years; most new infections now occur among injection drug users.Scientific efforts to tackle hepatitis C began as soon as the virus was identified. The development of a test for hepatitis C eliminated the risk of contracting the virus through blood transfusions and provided a way for individuals to know if they were infected. Treatment options also began to emerge during the 1990s -- but until very recently treatments only worked for about half of the patients who tried them and often had serious side effects.In 2011 a new generation of hepatitis C therapies became available. They were effective for about 70 percent of patients. However, the new therapies remained difficult to take and tolerate. Treatment could last for months with potentially severe side effects ranging from fatigue and flu-like symptoms to anxiety and depression. It's little wonder that large numbers of people were not treated.Those days should now be behind us. Today, available hepatitis C therapies are even better, and can cure the vast majority of patients in 12-24 weeks, with far fewer treatment-related side effects. Just as highly effective therapies transformed our national approach to fighting HIV, new treatments for hepatitis C offer the potential to eliminate the virus as a major killer in this country. In fact, we could soon see a day when no one dies of hepatitis C infection.Turning that promise into reality will require more than improved treatments. To end hepatitis C in the United States, we need a concerted effort to put this often-overlooked epidemic on the national radar. We must commit to testing for the virus and ensuring those who are infected have access to care and treatment.Fortunately, hepatitis C infection can be diagnosed with a simple blood test. The test can be done in a doctor's office and is almost always available with no insurance co-pay. Because baby boomers, those born from 1945 through 1965, are six times more likely than other Americans to be infected with hepatitis C, CDC recommends that everyone in the baby boom generation get a one-time test for the virus. Non-baby boomers should also get tested if they have one or more risks for hepatitis C. These can include anyone who has ever injected illicit drugs and people living with HIV.Baby boomers, and anyone else at risk, can help protect their health by asking their health provider for a simple hepatitis C test. Health providers, health departments and insurers should also work together to ensure that testing is as available and encouraged as other routine diagnostic tests, like those for cholesterol and breast or colon cancer.The other important piece of the puzzle is ensuring that anyone diagnosed with hepatitis C gets the right treatment. While hepatitis C therapies have improved dramatically in recent years, choosing the best treatment can still be complex. Treatment can vary based on the specific strain of hepatitis C, the stage of liver disease, and whether the person has been previously treated.Making hepatitis C a disease of the past comes with a price, but it will save lives and money in the long term. In fact, curing 300,000 people will avert an estimated $2.5 billion in health care costs, while preventing 120,000 premature deaths, thousands of liver transplants, and the extraordinary suffering that the virus can cause for infected individuals and their families. We now have the tools to make hepatitis C a disease of the past, just 25 years after its discovery. But scientific progress can only bring about the end of an epidemic if it is matched by our determination to act. Let's step up hepatitis C testing and treatment and begin to write the final chapter to this devastating national epidemic."

According to The Guardian, this is the first time that the MCB, Britain's largest Muslim organization, has explicitly spoken out against the practice of FGM.Dr. Yunes Teinaz, a FORWARD trustee and fellow at the Royal Society for Public Health, said in a press release:FGM is practiced contrary to the teachings of Islam and is prohibited in the UK and most EU-countries. Many girls could be saved from their cruel fate, if there was more awareness among the community of the consequences of FGM. Let us make this possible by the joint work of FORWARD, MCB and religious leaders to build awareness about the negative consequences of FGM in the communities. We will continue to welcome any and every opportunity to raise our voices and to campaign against this illicit practice.The MCB plans to put the flyers in each of the 500 mosques that make up its membership, raising awareness about the violent custom which affects between 100 to 140 million women worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. It is illegal in the UK, carrying with it a prison sentence of up to fourteen years, even if the mutilation took place outside of British borders. The flyer states:FGM is not an Islamic requirement. There is no reference to it in the holy Qur'an that states girls must be circumcised. Nor is there any authentic reference to this in the Sunnah, the sayings or traditions of our prophet. FGM is bringing the religion of Islam into disrepute.It also provides police, charity, and government hotlines to address suspected cases of FGM.Last week, a summit of UK religious leaders met to sign a declaration against FGM, asserting that it is a practice unsupported by any religious doctrines. Sheikh Tayeb Mustapha Cham of the Taiba Welfare Foundation believes that religious leaders are duty-bound to speak out against FGM. ""Now it is only imams who are isolated from society who still support this practice,"" he told The Guardian. ""Together we can remove those barriers and say this is nothing to do with religion. The voice [of religious leaders] will be heard, and if the advice comes from them, they will be obeyed."""

We need to welcome them and open the doors of the synagogues.”Members of the Central Consistory, France’s top Jewish religious authority, elected Korsia to a seven-year term.A slight, bearded man, 50-year-old Korsia ran against five other candidates for the post of grand rabbi. He won handily in a runoff Sunday (June 22). The previous chief rabbi, Gilles Bernheim, resigned last year over a plagiarism scandal.Judaism expert Martine Cohen of the Paris-based National Center for Scientific Research said Korsia represents a shift back to a more “Modern Orthodoxy,” from a more conservative strand embraced in recent years.Korsia’s election comes during a deeply troubled time for France’s Jewish community, the largest in Europe. A record number of French Jews have immigrated to Israel over the past year, partly for economic reasons but also because of a spate of anti-Semitic attacks.The 2012 killings of four French Jews in Toulouse, the shooting deaths at a Brussels Jewish museum last month — along with the surging popularity of France’s far-right National Front party — have served to reinforce Jewish fears.“At a time of despair, I want to restore confidence in the institution and in France,” Korsia said.Addressing a recent money-for-divorce scandal that has stirred debate over women’s rights and their difficulties in divorcing, Korsia also said he would enforce existing “good sense” regulations that would allow women to obtain a get, or religious divorce document.“We cannot change the halakhah,” or Jewish law, said Valerie Kaufman, who backed a rival candidate for the post. “But we can change the way women are supported during this bad period. And it’s important to have a chief rabbi who understands this.”"

(Photo by Raffi Kirdi/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb4643a26000035008257b9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This week marks the start of the 35th Montreal Jazz Festival, an annual celebration of music that despite its name, really elevates a range of styles to an international stage for 11 days in Montreal. In prep for this special landmark year, I caught up with André Ménard, the festival's artistic director and co-founder, who has helped grow it from less than 10 concerts to over 600 performances, each year. Coupled with their team's incredible business and cultural success, Ménard sees the appeal of festivals as a cornerstone to the music experience -- that as much as how we listen to and exchange music has evolved, the live experience has, for the most part, stayed the same. This truth is reflected in the growth Ménard and his team have demonstrated over 35 years, when their festival started ""a little revolution"" that turned sleepy summers in Montreal to a cultural extravaganza that's even inspired redevelopment of the public spaces around the Places des Artes - all to help bring more free music to the city's residents and visitors. However, Ménard admits that they could never have predicted this incredible success, or ""would have been seen as megalomaniac[s].""Back to its name, one that might be confusing when you see Snoop Dogg, Rufus Wainwright, Diana Ross, and the Montreal Symphony Orchestra on the bill. The festival has evolved over the years from being strictly focused on jazz into a true celebration of music. ""The music of our time is still very much influenced by jazz,"" said Ménard. ""The jazz attitude, the jazz way of creating music is present in a lot of our music today.""For Ménard it doesn't need to be so prescriptive. ""I've always seen music as a living body,"" said Ménard. ""We cover the whole gamut of music, especially jazz, from the 30s until now. We [also] experiment with programming that can be quite daring, quite surprising"" while still offering a great musical output.With all that has changed and grown over the years, as much as Ménard focuses on the artistic elements, he and the team take their other responsibilities very seriously, like tourism development.Music festivals have popped up all over the world, including in the U.S., however, Ménard believes their formula in Montreal is unique. Out of the approximately 600 events this year, the majority are free and within a 2-3 block radius of each other, giving it a concentrated and communal feel. It has an impact in the hundreds of millions of dollars each year, but thanks to its focused approach, Ménard believes it has an even more important impact on the perception of music. ""It's not a VIP experience we're selling here. It's really inclusive, socially and economically."" It's also inclusive for all members of the family, with music that can interest all generations. ""The vision of the jazz festival is a bit utopian,"" Ménard said. He also noted that currently sponsors cover nearly half of the festival's $30 million budget each year, which is used to fund more free concerts, including a major performance this year by singer, Diana Krall, who first performed at the festival early in her career. When asked how they might continue to grow what has already become such a major cultural force for Montreal, Canada, and the world, Ménard brought it back once again to the access and quality of music. In fact, he sees growth as challenging the artists to go outside of their routine formula and offer new music, approaches and innovation that provides a unique perspective that can only be experienced at the Montreal Jazz Festival. He said, ""If you're playing the Montreal Jazz Festival, then you should try and do something special, not your usual club set."" It's a chance for them to go ""from digital back into the analog context of a concert,"" conveying an attitude that helps make celebrated music events like the Montreal Jazz Festival a unique opportunity that's got to be experienced live.The Montreal Jazz Festival runs from June 26-July 6, 2014.

See the other side as 'some mother's sons', you are less willing to sacrifice your own."" -- Roger EbertWomen and men are wired differently; men generally prefer the objective, impersonal approach to conflict, dealing with problems swiftly and decisively.Women tend to see issues as more personal -- 'people-related' issues that can be resolved over time for the good of all. They tend to solve family problems through incentives and initiatives -- through cooperation -- realizing that in most cases the solutions won't necessarily be decisive or swift; they involve building trust through a set of skills relating to successful conflict resolution and learning to work together for the good of the family/society. For example: one toy, two children arguing for it. The father may tend to just take away the toy, thereby solving the problem, while the mother may tell them they must take turns; each can play with it for five minutes, then give it to the other. She will set a timer for them. Or, she may encourage them to play together with it. This process involves trust in the mother to fulfill her promise while teaching patience with a long-term vision.As the children grow older, moving into progressively more complex societal situations, they will already have a foundation for negotiating their way through them, with parental guidance. A Woman and Child in a Sunlit Interior painted by Albert Edelfelt in 1889.Grassroots resolution of societal conflicts is taking place in India, Palestine, Africa, Afghanistan, Colombia and elsewhere.The 1996 film Some Mother's Son, set in Northern Ireland during 'The Troubles,' explores the thinking of mothers with sharply conflicting viewpoints as they come to terms with the issue of whether or not to prolong the lives of their sons. The sons, on hunger strike in a British prison, have fallen into near-death comas; the mothers are left to decide about life support. The women gradually begin to understand each other's positions, and to come to terms with their own and the others' viewpoints. It is a powerful film.Through Mothers Across Borders, mothers in strife-torn situations trying to hold their families together in as normal a manner as possible, can take heart in knowing that other mothers are supporting them. Through mothers reaching each out to each other across global borders, more and more mothers learn that they are not alone in working to nurture healthy family lives by teaching their sons (and daughters) how to get along harmoniously. Mothers can encourage each other, sharing experiences, even humorous ones, and tips on coping. And in patriarchal societies wives, patiently and steadily can ideally show their husbands that, by learning peaceful techniques for solving conflicts including leaving grudges aside, they will become heroes in their families because they have the moral courage to change. When husbands are not open to peaceful ways, mothers can teach their sons instead. An excellent similar project could involve Fathers Across Borders, in which they demonstrate that men are far more powerful when they participate in healthy, lasting society-building, beginning with their families, than when they go around bashing and killing. By choosing a positive approach they are building a strong, lasting legacy. As more and more mothers and fathers choose to guide their families harmoniously, their influence can ripple out across society so that, over time they create a more peaceful, safe, stable and productive world. We never know how far we can progress anywhere until we get started and begin moving in the direction of peaceful coexistence. Mothers Across Borders is free of charge on social media, involving only a few minutes whenever convenient, to post messages of support, encouragement, humor, and tips. Getting started is easy. On the Facebook page Mothers Across Borders, on Twitter (#MothersAcrossBorders) and on First-Rate America, we all can add our comments and suggestions. In addition to building family harmony, we also want to build healthy, vibrant societies. And, of course we encourage, scholars and other experts to contribute with suggestions and initiatives for cooperative innovation, sustainability and education. Each of us in our own culture has learned successful family dynamics. Let us share those lessons so that we can learn from each other, and grow together. When you and I are no longer on the Earth and our children take over, let us take comfort in knowing we will have taught them the skills and values needed to provide a 21st century global society based on peaceful, respectful cooperation that they can pass on to their children."

The title of the film comes from the biblical miracle that's echoed in the image of Jan Palach's self-immolation with the conceit lying in the fact that while the body might have died his spirit lived on.Twenty years after his death came the Velvet Revolution of l989 in which Communism was finally overthrown. Apparently, the biblical metaphor still remains relevant. In a flagrant slap in the face to post-modernism with its promise of non-ideological drives in an equally non-Manichean universe, what was deemed unthinkable in our day and age, occurred only weeks ago in the Crimea. Burning Bush splices real life footage as well as characters into its partially fictionalized narrative and the central figure is the real life figure of Dagmar Buresova (Tatiana Pauhofova), a lawyer who brings libel charges against a party apparachnik named Novy (Martin Huba) who had claimed that Jan Palach's death was the result of a reactionary conspiracy. Novy claims Palach's act was intended as a circus trick, ""cold fire"" in which the illusion of burning is created.The conspiracy theory derives from the notion that the Russians would be provoked into a full out annexation of Czechoslovakia if the ante were raised--something which those who preferred a veneer of autonomy to the truth of subjugation were out to forestall.The leitmotif of appearance and reality actually inserts itself from the beginning of the film when the iconic burning scene, which also recalls the Buddhist monks in Vietnam in a similar period, is reflected in a ticket kiosk and a number of other mirrored surfaces, mimicking the distancing effect the mind creates to protect itself from traumatic perception. Kafka's cockroach, an honorary citizen of Prague, makes a cameo appearance in Holland's film and he's neither killed nor freed from the box in which he's kept as food for a lizard, which is one way to view the geopolitics of Eastern Europe at the time.Political films tend to create a black and white universe and Burning Bush is rescued from being a lives of the saints, employing the Czech penchant for ambivalence and irony, which serve to broaden its moral spectrum{This was originally posted to Francis Levy's blog of rants and reactions to contemporary politics, art and culture}"

The paranoia was stoked by the NRA and the gun industry itself, which benefited from fears that the Second Amendment was in peril.But even the most paranoid gun buyers are starting to understand that Washington will be unable to do anything anytime soon to stem the flow of school shootings -- of which there have been 74 since Sandy Hook.Now, a leading gun manufacturer's stock is sliding as the demand for guns is expected to decline.In its financial report released last Thursday, Smith & Wesson reported a 4.6 percent decline in profits for its fourth quarter, compared to last year. The company is also predicting lower demand for the coming year. According to Bloomberg.com, financial analysts think that fears of tighter gun legislation have stalled, which is leading to fewer people buying guns.""Demand for modern sporting rifles has fallen off significantly following the post-Newton [sic] legislation-driven demand and the ensuing post-surge period,"" said Chris Krueger, an analyst at Lake Street Capital Markets, in a note to clients. ""Long gun sales will decline about 25 percent in FY2015 and become a smaller percentage of Smith & Wesson's sales.""Dean Lockwood, a weapons systems analyst at the market research firm Forecast International, told The Huffington Post that gun owners ""have gotten over the panic buying stage and are back to a more normal level.""""Because of all the political furor, there was a huge spike in purchases in guns and ammunition. There were major retailers who could literally not keep things on the shelves -- people were buying things as soon as they put them out there. And that has since eased up. I don't know if you want to say people have gotten their fill, but the panic has subsided somewhat,"" he said.Lockwood noted that gun sales are typically volatile based on political conditions.""We're starting to see the ebb in the ebb and flow of sales. The gun industry is especially susceptible, given the politics of it, and you will see spikes and then it will ease off, spikes and then it will ease off,"" he said.""It doesn't take much for another spike, another panic,"" Lockwood added. ""You could have one announcement -- boom, we're right back. It's that sort of situation. Don't think of it as a rounded bell curve. Think of it as [a] spike and then gradual valley from there, because that's the way it tends to run.""However, he noted that the gun industry also relies on brand loyalty, which can help stabilize the market. In that sense, he thinks Smith & Wesson's sales decline is fairly inconsequential and ""a blip on the radar in the grand scheme of things.""""Smith & Wesson knows that they'll have customers who will always buy Smith & Wesson. It's that sort of loyalty that drives them and sustains them. As long as they can maintain the quality of their products, there's going to be a market,"" he said.Smith & Wesson reported record profits for fiscal year 2014, and overall its stock has risen dramatically over the last year. The company's financial success has been bolstered by rising handgun sales for self-defense purposes and an increase in state concealed-carry legislation. According to The Wall Street Journal, the company has been focusing on a new line of lightweight pistols that can be stowed inside a small purse or a pocket."

My answer is 1) I'm Latina and I do understand and 2) being discriminatory is not part of any 'culture,' but it does exist in all cultures, unfortunately, until the public is made aware of and understands the power of words.In many countries the use of totally racist words were once also defended as 'cultural.' But people of different ethnicities and religions, including African Americans and Jews said 'no more, enough with the jokes and derogatory words.'That's why to all those who want to defend the use of this word I propose this, when they say ""The use of 'puto' is cultural. It's very Mexican"" to substitute the following ""Racism is cultural. It's very Mexican (or Argentine or British or?"" Let's see who wants to go out and defend racism.The other excuse that I hear quite often is ""I didn't intend to insult anyone."" As if the intention behind the action was more important than its result. The intent of the people using a word or taking an action is not what's relevant. What's relevant is the actual impact that the word or action has on someone else.It's downright depressing to hear the excuse of ""culture"" or intention to defend the desire to continue to use a word that hurts us so much.And it does hurt. Those words have a sad place in the lives of many of us, because we grew up listening to them, tolerating their use, hiding our hurt, smiling when really we wanted to cry. Those words have affected many of us (some would say haunted) from childhood.Too bad it had to come to this because, not only in Mexico but also in other countries, homophobia and transphobia are sadly common.How great would it be that the legacy of this World Cup were not solely new buildings or stadiums, but rather a new awareness not just in Brazil or Mexico but throughout the whole world of the power behind words--and not just when used during fútbol games, but also at home, where young people learn everything about the world from their parents.I know that one day soon our children and grandchildren will ask us ""Is it true that people used to say those words openly in stadiums and other places?'' I, at least want to be able to answer 'yes but I did my best to eradicate homophobia.' Instead of looking for excuses.To learn more about slurs, please visit http://www.glaad.org/worldcup."

The excitement lasts for just 48 hours before it closes, usually not to be seen again for years.""I always warn people not to eat lunch before they come see it because they are not going to keep it down,"" said Angel Lara, greenhouse manager at Selby Gardens, located on Florida's west coast.

Nearly 2,000 visitors came during the weekend to goggle at its 6 feet (2 meters) of putrid glory, four times normal attendance.Sibling Audrey - also named after a character in ""Little Shop of Horrors,"" a musical comedy about a blood-thirsty plant - is expected to follow suit in eight to 10 days.In daily Facebook updates, Selby Gardens said Audrey grew 4 inches (10 cm) overnight and now stands 4 feet (122 cm) tall.

Union-backed critics hammer away at the retailing giant for what they say are substandard wages and health benefits for the company's 1.3 million U.S. workers. (AP Photo/April L. Brown)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb30f56260000e9008204ae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Accused of paying its workers too little, Walmart has responded in the most 2014 way possible: by being snarky on the Internet with a ""fact check."" Unfortunately, it is longer on snark than on facts. Walmart rep David Tovar recently took a digital red pen and marked up a New York Times opinion column by Timothy Egan that suggested Walmart could help fix America's income inequality problem simply by raising wages for its low-paid workers. It was a fun idea with a lot of viral potential, and way cheaper than actually paying a living wage. So. Hilarious. At least to right-wingers: The Wall Street Journal's in-house rape apologist James Taranto called it ""devastating."" NewsBusters called it not just ""devastating"" but also ""spirited."" Tucker Carlson's Daily Caller called it ""EPIC."" In the face of such success, it seems almost unsporting to fact-check Walmart's fact-check -- almost, but not quite. (Tovar's full fact-check can be seen at the end of this story.)Egan accused Walmart of draining U.S. tax coffers because its workers make so little that they have to go on food stamps and other public assistance to make ends meet. ""We are the largest tax payer in America,"" Tovar countered. ""Can we see your math?""Actually, we would like to see Walmart's math, because Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Apple and Wells Fargo paid more in taxes than Walmart, according to a January study by 24/7 Wall Street. That study used 2012 data in some cases, but fresher numbers haven't changed the picture much, according to HuffPost's review of company financial reports. It could be that Tovar meant that Walmart has the biggest U.S. tax bill, but that would also not be correct -- Apple paid more in U.S. taxes than Walmart in the latest fiscal year. Wells Fargo, too, if you count deferred taxes, as the bank does, taking a hit to earnings.Walmart spokesman Kory Lundberg said in a phone interview that the company was looking into the discrepancy.Walmart does pay a lot in taxes, for sure -- more than $6 billion in U.S. federal taxes alone in its latest fiscal year. But by not paying its workers a living wage, which does force some unknown number of them onto public assistance, its policies also arguably eat into a lot of tax revenue. A recent study by Americans For Tax Fairness estimated that Walmart workers cost the U.S. government $6.2 billion a year. The group also estimated that Walmart and its founding Walton family cost the government another $1.6 billion in tax revenue through various tax loopholes. Walmart has repeatedly disputed the ATF's $6.2 billion number, and Tovar did so again in his fact-check. Trouble is, Walmart never offers any numbers of its own. Tovar claimed, ""We see more associates move off of public assistance as a result of their job at Walmart."" But that is not a particularly informative statement. ""More"" than what? Do more associates move off of public assistance than move on to it? How many move in each direction annually? Tovar's link takes you to one person's story in a YouTube video -- which, thanks, but without hard numbers, this is not so much a fact-check as it is an unsubstantiated assertion.Walmart's Lundberg said the company has studied the number of its workers who are on public assistance, but declined to share its data.""There are people that come to Walmart on public assistance, and through their job at Walmart, we see that most are able to move off of it within a couple of years,"" he said.Regarding a 2013 study by House Democrats that estimated that one store in Wisconsin costs taxpayers nearly $1 million per year in assistance, Tovar claimed the fact-checking website Politifact has declared it ""mostly false."" But Tovar's claim is mostly misleading -- Politifact was addressing an Ed Schultz segment on MSNBC that cited the study, not the study itself. Tovar also claimed that the company pays hourly employees $12.91 an hour, and that this figure does not include the pay of any store managers. But Walmart's pay figure has not changed much from what it was in previous years, when it did include some store managers who are paid hourly.In a phone interview, spokesman Lundberg conceded that the latest figure does include some department managers who are paid hourly. Tovar's fact-check is not factual.Egan's column cited a November 2013 story by Fortune reporter Stephen Gandel, which argued that Walmart could ""give workers a 50 percent raise without hurting shareholder value."" In his ""fact check,"" Tovar questioned the credibility of Gandel, an established journalist, without offering any reason to do so. He suggested that we should instead listen to Jason Furman, chairman of President Barack Obama's Council Of Economic Advisors, as if Furman had recently written something that countered Gandel's argument. Tovar did offer a link to an unrelated piece by Furman from 2006 about how Walmart helps the poor by letting them buy cheap stuff. Furman's piece was flawed -- Walmart could probably also help the poor by giving them better wages -- but, more importantly, it has no relation to Gandel's argument. In the past, Walmart has also pointed to a 2005 paper by Furman that calls Walmart a ""progressive success story."" But in that paper, Furman also wrote that Walmart ""does not pay enough for a family to live the dignified life Americans have come to expect and demand"" and that the company had tried to shred the social safety net on which many of its low-paid workers rely.Tovar did not dispute a recent Lake Research Partners survey that found Walmart has a 28 percent disapproval rating among Americans. Instead, he used math to point out that this result means that Walmart has a 72-percent approval rating. He did not mention that rivals Target, Costco and Amazon have far, far higher approval ratings than Walmart.Tovar also rather desperately tried to co-opt some of the corporate goodwill that has been accumulated by Starbucks over the years, by marking up an Egan sentence about Starbucks' OK pay and benefits to make it look as if Walmart offers OK pay and benefits, too. Tovar wrapped up his rebuttal by suggesting that Egan write a different story. This story would be one about how Walmart is helping bring back the American Dream by buying more U.S.-made goods -- which is pretty ballsy, after Walmart has spent decades helping to wreck America's manufacturing base by selling us cheaply made foreign goods. This alternative story would also explain how Walmart is ""expanding training, education and workforce development programs,"" all stuff that Walmart says is more important than just paying a boring old living wage.This is the standard corporate objection to raising wages: We're not going to pay people more now, we're going to train them so they can earn more in the distant future. But you can't eat education, or pay your mortgage with a workforce development program. Why can't low-wage workers have some of both?I'm going to have to declare Walmart's fact check ""Mostly Bullshit.""Here's Tovar's response in its entirety: "

Tensions between the U.S. and Russia have been rising. The countries have been at odds over Syriaâs civil war, Iranâs nuclear program and Russiaâs crackdown on domestic opposition. U.S. officials are uneasy about what they see as a more assertive foreign policy by Vladimir Putin, who returned to the Russian presidency in May. (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60d9880d280000ee376ff749.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Russian soldiers on the move, MiG jet flyovers of U.S. naval ships, NATO war maneuvers, a capital of a European country at risk of invasion. American news headlines from the last few months look like they belong to another era. The same can be said for Russian newspapers, which have whipped the country into nationalist frenzy in response to perceived aggression from the West.The Americans are replaying the Cold War, while Russia is replaying World War II -- wars that each side can claim that they won. Neither era has very much in common with the current conflict in Ukraine, but reference to past battles in order to understand and respond to present-day opponents has potential consequences. Allusions to the Cold War in American news and media outlets have made a dramatic resurgence as the Ukrainian Crisis has heated up and dominated headlines. The line of continuity can be read: Budapest 1956, Prague 1968, Kiev 2014. In this particular guise, Putin is behaving like the General Secretary of an only slightly reformed Soviet empire.In Russia, mention of a ""new Cold War"" is scarcely heard. Instead, rhetoric of nationalism, outside invaders, and threat of fascism have become part of a template of rationalization for Russia's opposition to Ukraine's European-oriented government. These are signals to Russian citizens -- codified language belonging to the World War II era when invaders from Western Europe almost destroyed the Motherland. History has always been used -- and often cynically manipulated -- to inform present conditions and make the case for a particular set of political aims and objectives. Yet, in the ongoing Ukrainian Crisis, the two competing sides have appropriated different histories. In asserting their victories, both east and west are reconfiguring the past to align with contemporary narratives rooted more in political necessity than the history books. On June 6, 2014, Russian leader Vladimir Putin attended a celebration on the beaches of Normandy to commemorate the 70th anniversary of D-Day. Russian media downplayed the strategic importance of the invasion and, more generally, the Allies' contribution in World War II.The Motherland lost twenty million people in the fight against fascism, after all, and the battle is not yet over. Now, the fascists in Ukraine, as it is implied, are once again threatening peace. Meanwhile, there is little evidence to support the claims. Paradoxically, significant support in ""New Europe"" for accession to Russia's policies can be found in the ranks of the rising right-wing parties deemed by some to be neo-fascist.The United States, for its part, seems to have dusted off the playbook from the Cold War era, framing the very complex circumstances of the Ukrainian Crisis as having been fueled by ""Russian agents"" in a Soviet-style ""incredible act of aggression"" as Secretary of State John Kerry summed it up for the American public. Kerry implored his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov to resist turning Ukraine into a ""pawn"" for ongoing Russo-American tensions. After a quarter of a century since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the concept of proxy wars with Russia is now back in fashion.Yet, for all the rhetoric, the underpinnings of the Cold War -- ideological competition, threat of Mutually Assured Destruction, and global bilateral balance of power - no longer exist. Without the bitter Manichean struggle that viewed Communism as a global and contagious virus (with nuclear capability), Cold War analogies to present-day Russia appear misplaced or at a minimum grossly overdone.Reacting to historical periods that were enormously antagonistic and bloody to guide action on the emerging battlefield of eastern Ukraine has the potentiality for further escalating conflict, fueled by past victories and memory of old clashes.Rather than appropriating particular histories in service of immediate political goals and provoking further animosity, study of long-term cultural values and social tendencies can provide a foundation for understanding motivations and strategies.If history can inform ongoing developments in eastern Ukraine, Russia is acting as it always has -- as a nationalist entity that transcends both ideology and ruler. Stalin understood this when he dubbed World War II ""The Great Patriotic War."" His soldiers might not fight for him, or even communism, but they would give their lives for Mother Russia, as they did for Tsar Alexander in 1812.And for America's part, intervention in foreign affairs and conflicts might also belong to a tradition much older than the Cold War -- Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points. The idealistic tendency toward active promotion of democracy, self-determinism, and transparency, has the capacity to conflict with others' national interests, including Russia's, even while Russia's own expressions of its geopolitical interests are shrouded in similar democratic rhetoric.Russia will likely always act in what it perceives as its geostrategic interest, protecting its sphere of influence and its Slavic/Eurasian uniqueness. The U.S. will also act in its perceived interest, which often somewhat confusingly includes ideology and idealism as manifestations of American Exceptionalism.History informs us of the past and perhaps its meaning, but memory and rhetoric are used as tools to validate states' interests. For all the differences in how Russia and the United States are representing the current clash in Ukraine, pointing to historical examples that do not stand up to rigorous analysis, both countries share a strikingly similar approach to using past episodes as justification for present action.While this does not tell us anything new about history, it does illuminate the malleability of official versions of ""what happened"" and signal the potential risks of exploiting past conflicts burned into the collective psyche of both countries, provoking antipathy, fear, and possibly war."

Duke won 66-48. (AP Photo/Gerry Broome)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb757512100000002c8f0f5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Duke sophomore small forward Rodney Hood enters the NBA Draft with one of the most unique skill sets available. At 6-foot-8, he possesses a lethal jumper and impressive ball-handling skills, along with an attacking, slashing nature that GMs covet. Yet one of the keys to Hood's on-court success has actually come from his time off the court. After transferring from Mississippi State following his freshman season, NCAA rules forced Hood to sit out a season before he could play again. Despite the frustrations of not playing, Hood embraced the wealth of knowledge that came from legendary Duke coach Mike Krzyzewski, who guided him as a basketball player and as a person during his two years at the school.""He just taught me by being a captain that nobody cares about excuses,"" Hood told The Huffington Post. ""This is what is going to happen in the NBA. Regardless of how you’re feeling that night, everybody is going to expect you to produce, so whatever is happening off the court -- you might have a little injury -- you have to suck it up and be a man for your teammates. ... At first I didn't understand why, but after going through it I really started believing in myself, and I could take that into the NBA, or any profession.""Hood spent an entire year focused just on classes and practice, without the reward of playing in games. That meant a lot of downtime with his teammates and Coach K, as well as ample time for reflection.""Off the court, the biggest thing I learned from him was just to have a presence, not to come in and be quiet,"" Hood said of Krzyzewski. ""Have a presence, because it would benefit the people who were looking up to me."" This required the Mississippi native to push himself out of his comfort zone, facing new challenges in a new environment away from home. ""Leading by example has always been my staple, and that’s why I was a captain in past years -- because I was able to lead by example,"" he says. ""I'm more of a one-on-one type of guy rather than a vocal guy, but I understand I have to change. It's not a hard transition, but it's just different.""What is also different is Hood's game itself, a rare blend of athleticism, size and versatility. During his one season in Durham, he averaged more than 16 points per game, shooting a stellar 42 percent from 3-point range. In doing so, he gladly exchanged ""go-to"" roles with all-everything freshman and potential top pick Jabari Parker.""Playing alongside Jabari was great,"" Hood said, calling himself and Parker the best duo in the country. ""He could go off for four to five minutes at a time, and I could go off [when he] goes to the bench."" Having successfully played alongside a superstar should only help Hood at the next level, as should his ability to play both sides of the ball. While not a lock-down defender yet, he has spent the last several months in Florida improving his strength and overall fitness in the hopes of becoming one, while also honing his offensive interior game.""I think I'm just rare,"" he said. ""I think I'm different than any other guy in this draft. Being 6-foot-8 and able to play the two, just my size and my position. I think me being left-handed is also a strength of mine. ... I think you see some guys just come in and they're a two, they're a one, they're a two trying to play a one. I think I could play the two or the three without any hesitation. I think I could do that easily.""For the 21-year-old Hood, who says he models his game after two-way guys like Paul George, Manu Ginobili and Andre Iguodala, the past two years have been a learning experience both on and off the floor. One reason he wanted to attend Duke was to challenge himself academically while simulating NBA life by living away from his family. His mother, who works in the Mississippi education system, stressed the importance of education throughout his childhood. And Hood rewarded her by earning All-ACC academic honors at Duke.""I learned that I can evolve in the best situations,"" he said. Hood said he took ""great pride"" in being able to do things people thought he couldn't do off the court, and that the academic honors were meaningful for him because of what they proved to his mother. ""I made her proud,"" he said. The next steps for Hood are the same as those for other prospects: He soon will embark on a slew of daily workouts with individual teams potentially interested in drafting him. Given his rising status, he conceivably could be selected in the lottery (the top 14 picks), and likely won't last past the late teens. And as for that draft night suit?""I haven't been really thinking about it,"" he said. ""I've been trying to focus on getting there to New York, but I guess I'll start thinking about it now.""

Should employers care whether you were among the approximately 43 percent of Americans who played at least one sport in high school? New research published this month by the Journal of Leadership & Organizational Studies shows that -- justifiably or not -- people who played a varsity high school sport are expected to be more self-confident, have more self-respect, and demonstrate more leadership than people who were part of other extracurriculars. Beyond expectations, the new article finds separately that people who earned a varsity letter more than 50 years ago actually do demonstrate more leadership, self-confidence, and self-respect -- plus, they donate time and money more frequently than others.While the article's text is free to read, three notable aspects that were left on the cutting floor as part of the peer review process seem worthwhile to highlight. The most prominent aspect? Along with co-authors Brian Wansink and Mitsuru Shimizu, I drafted earlier versions of the new research article to include a pilot study in which we tried to figure out whether former athletes are disproportionately over- or under-represented in Congress.Lots of other information is collected about Congresspeople -- the Congressional Research Service, for example, systematically profiles each Congress and reports patterns in variables like previous Occupation, Religion, and Educational degrees.In our case, we were able to collect information during the 2011-12 legislative session from 45 U.S. representatives' offices and 32 senators' staff -- not enough for a study, but certainly an extraordinary source of anecdotal information.Neat findings from the systematic but incomplete survey suggest that sports-playing Presidents are the tip of the iceberg in the U.S. political hierarchy - that former student-athletes are disproportionately over-represented. For some interesting examples: the independent US Senator (I-VT) Bernie Sanders ran track and field in high school; Cleveland-based U.S. Representative Marcia Fudge played basketball, field hockey, and soccer; and, reportedly, the diminutive and former U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich was part of his high school's football team.Outside of politics? CEO biographical data isn't readily available with respect to past sports participation but students of obituaries and ""profiles"" in major newspapers will recognize that sports experiences are often mentioned in stories about high-ranking -- and often philanthropic -- business and community leaders.What else landed on the cutting floor for the new article?Peer reviewers made it crystal clear that causality should not be attributed to the findings that we presented. We agree. Throughout the article, we discuss how participation in competitive youth sports seems to ""indicate"" or ""signal"" organizationally-beneficial personality traits and behaviors.At some point in the process, though, it's also true that sports or music lessons or parenting or you-name-it must have some influence on causing or influencing the development of helpful traits and behaviors. In other words, unless one buys some form of genetic determinism, then it makes sense that a person's social environment (e.g., being part of a sports team) is going to help form or shape their values and preferences.From my shoes -- and thanks to my parents' investments as well as the resources of volunteer-run youth sports programs -- I learned tons of lifelong lessons about how people should function in organizations from playing competitive youth sports like baseball, football, and soccer. That fact is the third aspect of the article that's not visible since academic articles typically need to be ""theoretically motivated""; and so, authors' hunches usually have no place in a published article.Oh, and a fourth aspect that was left on the cutting floor? We entitled earlier versions of the article ""Revenge of the Jocks"" since the findings generally describe favorable outcomes for former student-athletes in contrast with the stereotype that jocks see their glory days fade at high school graduation (see Al Bundy, Married With Children) while others age much better. The new research article makes no mention of this riff on the Revenge of the Nerds but it does state plainly that people who earn a Varsity letter in high school do tend to enjoy advantages that extend beyond high school graduation day.How much advantage? That's tough to say at this point but it is interesting to note that the one person most would consider closest to being a presidential candidate for 2016 reportedly played shortstop as a girl, knew how to hit a curveball, and, sadly for her, grew up as a Cubs fan.Kevin Kniffin is a behavioral scientist at Cornell University."
