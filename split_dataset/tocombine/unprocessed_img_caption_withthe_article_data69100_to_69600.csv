That move was likely because the tail's barbed stinger can be dangerous when used in self-defense.However, Capello claims that after the babies were delivered, all the animals -- including the mother -- were thrown back into the water.""Guiltiness was heavier than hunger,"" he wrote, adding that they all appear to have survived.""Mom seemed pretty healthy when it swum off, and the sting (is) only a defense tool they don't need it to eat, so I guess they survived,"" Capello wrote.The remarkable birth comes just a couple weeks after a similar YouTube video showing a 12-year-old Australian boy assisting in another stingray's live birth.Miller Wilson counted at least eight babies exiting the massive stingray, which he named ""Big Mama.""Perry Hampton, vice president of animal husbandry at the Aquarium of the Pacific in Long Beach, California, warned against such ""dangerous and risky behavior"" in an interview with The Huffington Post when that video was posted.""It’s never a good idea to handle wild animals,"" Hampton said. ""The act alone causes stress. This is something that is difficult to measure but it affects them negatively in many ways. Added to that is the way he is handling them by picking them up by their spiracles [breathing openings behind their eyes]. Comparing it to lifting us up by our nostrils is overstating it, but you get the point.""Also on HuffPost:"

Are you translating a scientific paper? A website? Legal documents? A website? You may need a specialized translator in your particular field. Go with someone who has experience working in your subject, not just a native speaker.It's not only about the subject of the text you are translating, but also about the intended audience. Who is reading the documents you need to have translated, and for what purpose? Consider working with an agency that understands how to match up a project with a translator who understands the recipient on the other end, as the right combination is key to getting your materials across in the desired language in a clear and accurate fashion.Work with a translator who will strive for clarity and flow. The Language Blog says, ""A translation has to be easily comprehensible and well written, regardless of how poor the original document may be. Good translations commonly read much better than do the originals... an editor will go through the document and make sure that it reads smoothly and sounds as if it were originally written in the target language.""Get a quote first. Be sure you are working with a translator who understands the scope of the entire project and can give you a price quote upfront, so there are no surprises further down the line. Many online services now offer you the ability to upload your document for review before committing to the project.If you are translating your website, remember that it is an opportunity for you to go global with your content. You are now reaching more markets, which means more potential customers and that the eyeballs on your content around the world will increase. Panorama Languages advises that the best translator of a website understands that your ""content can be translated and adjusted to match the cultural expressions used by your target audience."""

THIS POST WILL CONTAIN STAR WARS SPOILERS.*hold music hums while you decide*We all good? Okay. By reading on, you hereby agree to hold the author of this post harmless for any potential Star Wars-ruining experience that may occur, in perpetuity until the heat death of the universe.I saw The Force Awakens yesterday afternoon. When you hit your fifth decade of life, and you've seen so many movies in those forty years that the tropes and cliches of cinematic storytelling have embedded themselves in your neural pathways to the point where your response to them becomes almost Pavlovian, you tend to approach any new theatrical venture, particularly one that has been so excessively hyped, with an unavoidable sense of cynicism. Here we are now, you say warily, paraphrasing Kurt Cobain, entertain us. And how often do you walk away feeling satisfied, or surprised? Rather infrequently, I have to admit. I enjoy the movies for what they are, but I always see the seams at the edges. And I went into The Force Awakens with a healthy distrust of its director, J.J. Abrams, a man whose storytelling style relies primarily on frustratingly circular references to the movies he grew up watching, rather than any particular unique vision.J.J., you sly, sly dog you.Granted, one does not walk into the seventh installment of a 40-year-old movie franchise expecting mind-blowing originality (I certainly don't expect it from Bond, my other great cinema love). I did receive the anticipated reprises of old favorite characters and the homages and tributes to everything that has made the world love Star Wars all these years. But what I also got, and what made me walk out of the theater with a broad, dumb smile on my face, was something that I'd been longing to see realized on screen for ages, and finding it in a Star Wars movie of all places was like the surprise toy inside the chocolate egg. I knew too, that as happy as I was to discover this, there were millions of girls and women to whom it would mean so much more. I'm happy for them most of all.To wit: the absolutely compelling character of Rey, played by English actress Daisy Ridley, is the center of the movie. The ""awakening"" referred to in the title is hers. She is brave, skilled, resourceful, determined, and over the course of the story, as her connection to the Force deepens, grows immensely powerful. She has a past that is not spelled out for us but rather is left as a tantalizing mystery. She is no one's love interest, and is not defined by her relationships with or unrequited longings for any particular man. And she kicks tremendous ass, whether it's outrunning TIE Fighters in a rusty old Millennium Falcon or confronting and defeating Dark Side villain Kylo Ren and saving Finn, the male character whom the movie's poster and trailers would have you presume is the new Jedi of this trilogy. (Abrams' controversial ""mystery box"" promotion style has worked very well here, which is why again, I hope you've already seen the movie as you're reading this.) And Rey achieves all of these things without descending into sassy or sexualized caricature, or a neon sign flashing above her head reading ""LOOK AT THIS AUDACIOUS, ENLIGHTENED STATEMENT OF FEMINISM WE MALE FILMMAKERS ARE MAKING.""Rey just is who she is, and frankly, it's glorious.I've always found the term ""empowered women"" a bit troubling, as it suggests that a powerful woman is somehow an anomaly, a deviation from the accepted norm. It is better to say that a woman is powerful by her very nature as a woman. Goes with the territory, folks. And yet in science fiction and fantasy this is too often the exception and not the rule. Looking back, there has never really been a good reason why in genre movies, women have not been able to take the forefront of the story, other than the increasingly outdated notion that the young boys who make up the presumed primary target demographic for this genre somehow won't be interested in seeing girls buckle their swash, or that somehow casting a female lead means you have to turn the story into a pedestrian rom-com with true love as the object of the quest.Instead, women are usually relegated to the secondary roles of eye candy, love interests or over-the-top man-hating villainesses, their characterizations as sketchy as the anatomically impossible poses in which they are often rendered in comic books. Why have we had eighteen Marvel movies without a female lead? Your guess is as good as mine, but it seems to stem largely from writers, producers and directors (and executives) unable to arrive at what feels like, in the light of The Force Awakens, should be a very obvious conclusion: that women with power and agency won't, in fact, scare men away from fantasy and science fiction movies. They belong there, as much as the boys do, and audiences will thank you for it. And yes, the dudes will love these characters too.Thankfully, there have been huge exceptions of late that may be, at last, softening this attitude. Frozen was a story in the fantasy genre about the bond between two sisters (one with tremendous magical powers), with male characters shunted to the background, and it only became the highest-grossing animated movie of all time. As I write this The Force Awakens has already become the fastest movie to hit $1 billion at the box office, and I'll wager here and now that it will eventually blast past Avatar and take its place on top of the all-time list. Because audiences love Luke, Leia, Han and Chewie, but it's Rey's story they are going to want to see again and again. (Unfortunately, merchandisers have not kept pace with the storytellers, as noted by the embarrassing lack of Rey toys on shelves this Christmas. We can only hope that Disney and its partners recognize this, the same way they were slow to react to Frozen's unanticipated popularity. Failing that, fans will delve into the imaginations that have been ignited by Rey and create their own toys and costumes from spare parts and clothes instead.)Criticism of Rey centers largely on the speed with which she acquires her Force abilities in the movie without any training, suggesting that this pushes her into Mary Sue territory (a trope from fan fiction where a gifted, basically perfect female character, usually a surrogate for the author, runs effortless circles around the established regulars). I would suggest that there are two responses to this, one ""in-universe"" and another examining the broader question. The in-universe explanation is found in a line from the very first movie, where Luke and Ben are discussing the Force and noting that while it obeys your commands, it also controls your actions. The Force is sentient and has an awareness of when people's greed and lust for power has pushed it out of balance, so it creates what it needs to set the universe right again. Rey's awakening is in response to the rising threat represented by dark-sider Kylo Ren and his mysterious master Snoke, and the speed at which it happens is perhaps a reflection of the urgency with which it is needed. (And it also makes for the movie's best scene in which Rey tries the Jedi Mind Trick on a Stormtrooper played by a very famous actor in disguise...)You could also suggest that Rey is just that damn gifted, which is where the Mary Sue question comes in, and my answer to that is, so effing what? In how many movies across how many genres have we seen preternaturally skilled guys? How many times have we seen a young male screw-up transformed into an unstoppable fighting machine in the space of a five-minute training montage? Why is this somehow more valid storytelling technique than seeing it happen to a woman? Yes, Rey may be in some ways an expression of wish fulfillment for fangirls, but thanks to some great writing (by Abrams and Lawrence Kasdan) and Daisy Ridley's magnetic performance she doesn't come off like that, and even if she does, I fail to see why this is a bad thing. We gents have plenty of examples on our side to choose from. I'd love to see more women like Rey in genre films, treated with all the maturity and complexity that those characters deserve, and I'm glad that the gauntlet has been thrown down. All those involved with her creation deserve accolades. (It should also be noted that The Force Awakens passes the Bechdel Test too.)I know a fair number of women who are big genre fans, and I'm excited to hear what they thought of Rey. I imagine they'll be able to articulate what Rey means to girls and women far better than I possibly could, so I'll sign off for the time being and let them take the stage and enjoy their well-deserved moment. And I will wait with bated breath for Episode VIII and the joy of discovering where Rey's story takes her next, my faith in the ability of the movies, and genre movies in particular, to surprise me renewed, and hungry for more."

Yet, they achieve this only because they exert so much influence inside, on themselves.We see only their outside.We see them innovate, speak their mind, and propel themselves forward toward bigger and better things.And, yet, we're missing the best part.The confidence and wherewithal that make their influence possible are earned. It's a labor of love that influential people pursue behind the scenes, every single day.And while what people are influenced by changes with the season, the unique habits of influential people remain constant. Their focused pursuit of excellence is driven by nine habits that you can emulate and absorb until your influence expands:  1. They think for themselvesInfluential people aren't buffeted by the latest trend or by public opinion. They form their opinions carefully based on the facts. They're more than willing to change their mind when the facts support it, but they aren't influenced by what other people think, only by what they know.  2. They are graciously disruptiveInfluential people are never satisfied with the status quo. They're the ones who constantly ask, ""What if?"" and ""Why not?"" They're not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom, and they don't disrupt things for the sake of being disruptive; they do it to make things better.  3. They inspire conversationWhen influential people speak, conversations spread like ripples in a pond. And those ripples are multidirectional; influencers inspire everyone around them to explore new ideas and think differently about their work.  4. They leverage their networksInfluential people know how to make lasting connections. Not only do they know a lot of people, they get to know their connections' connections. More importantly, they add value to everyone in their network. They share advice and know how, and they make connections between people who should get to know each other.  5. They focus only on what really mattersInfluential people aren't distracted by trivialities. They're able to cut through the static and clutter, focus on what matters, and point it out to everyone else. They speak only when they have something important to say, and they never bore people with idle banter.6. They welcome disagreementInfluential people do not react emotionally and defensively to dissenting opinions--they welcome them. They're humble enough to know that they don't know everything and that someone else might see something they missed. And if that person is right, they embrace the idea wholeheartedly because they care more about the end result than being right.  7. They are proactiveInfluential people don't wait for things like new ideas and new technologies to find them; they seek those things out. These early adopters always want to anticipate what's next. They're influential because they see what's coming, and they see what's coming because they intentionally look for it. Then they spread the word.8. They respond rather than reactIf someone criticizes an influential person for making a mistake, or if someone else makes a critical mistake, influential people don't react immediately and emotionally. They wait. They think. And then they deliver an appropriate response. Influential people know how important relationships are, and they won't let an emotional overreaction harm theirs. They also know that emotions are contagious, and overreacting has a negative influence on everyone around them.9. They believeInfluential people always expect the best. They believe in their own power to achieve their dreams, and they believe others share that same power. They believe that nothing is out of reach, and that belief inspires those around them to stretch for their own goals. They firmly believe that one person can change the world.Bringing It All TogetherTo increase your influence, you need to freely share your skills and insights, and you must be passionate in your pursuit of a greater future.What other qualities make people influential?

It bases its preference on candidates' view of the nuclear deal, and their policies toward the Middle East, particularly Syria, Israel, Iraq and the Gulf.Tehran would rather see a Democrat than a Republican as the next U.S. president. At one time there were minimal differences between the parties' views on Iran, but in the last few years the gap has widened.Democrats are more likely to honor the nuclear deal, which Iran needs to push the U.N. Security Council to lift crippling economic sanctions. This will enhance its legitimacy globally, which will facilitate its trade and military activities in other nations.Republicans view Iran's increasing influence in the Middle East as a national security threat. They tend to criticize Tehran more harshly than Democrats for its increasing military activities in Iraq and Syria. Democratic candidates prefer to reduce American boots on the ground in Iraq and Afghanistan, and turn a blind eye to what will fill the resulting vacuum.Democrats believe in further rapprochement with Tehran. With a Democratic president, Tehran will feel empowered to leverage its legitimacy and ratchet up its global position. Democrats view positively Iran's fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). This is a short-term vision, ignoring the long-term consequences of Tehran's military involvements and support for Shiite proxies across the region.The candidates' views on Iran's rival Israel is critical. While both parties publicly support Israel, Democrats have recently had strained ties with it due to their leanings toward the nuclear deal and further rapprochement with Tehran.EngagementDemocrats tend to prefer isolationism to more engagement in the region. From Tehran's perspective, a U.S. withdrawal creates a vacuum that can be filled by it or its Shiite proxies. Also, due to ISIS and the latest regional developments, Democrats lean more toward the idea of Iranian leadership in the region than Arab leadership. For Tehran, a Democratic president will tip the regional balance of power in its favor.Sanders subscribes to these views, and is much more left-leaning than the other Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Martin O'Malley. Sanders is isolationist and in favor of negotiating with Tehran. In the last Democratic debate, he emphasized the role of Iran. He is the only candidate who has frequently and strongly stressed the idea of cooperating with Tehran to deal with regional issues.Clinton prefers more U.S. regional engagement. For example, she favors a no-fly zone in Syria, which would threaten Tehran's interests there. Sanders focuses on domestic issues, and seeks to emulate European countries' domestic and foreign policies. It follows then that if he becomes president, there would be improved U.S.-Iranian ties since European nations enjoy better ties with Tehran than Washington.Since the odds appear to favor a Democratic victory in the 2016 election, bilateral ties are more likely to improve or at least not worsen.--Dr. Majid Rafizadeh, an American scholar and political scientist, is the president of the International American Council on the Middle East.

Trump for gross abuse of the Yiddish language.During a recent rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Mr. Trump said that Hillary Clinton ""got schlonged"" by Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary.But the Academy noted that ""schlong"" (a vulgar term for a penis of unusual size; literal origin, a snake or serpent), is a noun, and may never properly be used as a verb.Noting that this was not Mr. Trump's first offense against the Yiddish language and that Mr. Trump has repeatedly shown flagrant disrespect for the other religious and linguistic groups that make up America's cultural mosaic, the Academy issued a rare second formal reprimand.According to Academy Chair Reb Yankel Rabinowitz, the Academy concluded, after a spirited debate lasting seven hours, 37 minutes, that Mr. Trump is best described not as a ""putz"" (a fool or idiot; literally a penis), but rather as a ""schmuck"" (an odious or contemptible person, a prick; literally a penis).After much shouting and gesticulation, the meeting was adjourned at 4:37 p.m., with a recommendation that its conclusions be communicated to the public as expeditiously as possible.ADDENDUM: Sometimes satire and real life meet in strange ways. My piece on Trump and his misuse of Yiddish was drafted on December 23; the next day, I later learned from a friend, an event called Yiddish New York took place in Lower Manhattan. Trump's recent remarks were much discussed and those in attendance did not shy away from voicing their disapproval. Expressing the views of many at the gathering, Aaron Blacksberg, a Klezmer musician, responded to Trump's comments with a classic Yiddish expression: ""Gai kakhen afen yam"" (go defecate in the ocean)."

You want to pursue your dreams and live a successful life, but you just can't seem to do it.Everyone around you seems content with their lives. They seem to have achieved their dreams. Even those who are in the midst of hardship seem to be living their dreams.And you can't help thinking ... why not me?And it's a good question.After all, they're not healthier than you. They're not smarter than you. They're not more interesting than you. But for some reason, they seem to have achieved their dreams without struggle. And you start to wonder...What's their secret?In fact, I wondered that too. I've been there, and well ... it's depressing. So, I started doing research on what successful people do differently to fulfill their dreams. And I discovered that those who succeeded had certain characteristics in common. And knowing the truth about these traits they cultivated will change everything for you too.Use the following five tricks to help you succeed in fulfilling your dreams:1. Cultivate a growth mindsetPeople can have two mindsets -- the fixed mindset and the growth mindset.  The fixed-mindset person believes leaders are born. This type of mindset person avoids taking risks because they believe their destiny is already mapped out for them.The growth-mindset person believes you can achieve your dreams through practice, persistence, and perseverance. The growth mindset only comes to those who accept it. After accepting a growth mindset, your brain can stretch. And because the brain is like a rubber band, it stretches depending on how much you use it.With that mindset, you'll develop your strengths toward your dreams because you'll understand it's not through birth that dreams are achieved but rather through pursuing your dreams with maximum effort.2. Cultivate confidence in your dreamTrust in your ability to fulfill your dream. Get out of your comfort zone. Take risks, and follow your passion day in and day out.Your dream is a reflection of you, and only you can fulfill it. Without taking the plunge to pursue your dream, you'll stay in the same position, always wishing you had found the courage to pursue it.Make your dream your top priority. Create a schedule that makes it part of your daily habits. By making it a consistent daily habit, you'll prevent your fears from sabotaging your progress. Prove to yourself that you're worth giving that dream a shot. Stick to it, not just for weeks or months but for many years to come. Work hard to make the dream a reality.The more you believe your dream will come true, the more likely you are to achieve it. According to University of Wisconsin neuroscientist, Richard Davidson, the anticipation of achieving your goals makes you work harder toward them. Believe in your dream, and you will achieve it.3. Cultivate delayed gratificationLet your dream be your top priority every day. Commit never to postpone working on your dream even when you don't see results right away or when the urge to quit gets overwhelming.Let the top performers in every field motivate you; they are consistent, and they show up and deliver while everyone else is weighed down by life and that constant battle with procrastination.Be like those kids who waited for fifteen minutes to eat their marshmallow because they wanted an extra marshmallow. By the way, those kids who waited grew up with better social skills and were more successful according to a follow-up study.Choose the pain of discipline, and work on your dream every day, no matter how hard things get. You may not see results immediately, but the gratification you feel when all of your efforts finally come to fruition will be worth the wait.4. Cultivate Healthy RelationshipsHuman beings are created to be social. Relationships influence our mental health and provide a deep meaning and fulfillment in life. To succeed in life, make healthy relationships your top priority because you need other people to thrive to accomplish your dreams.A study conducted by Psychiatric George Vaillant on 268 Harvard undergraduate males from the class of 1938 to 1940 concluded that success depended on how well they related to other people and not how much money they had.So surround yourself with happy people because they'll make you happy too. Refrain from toxic people, those who continuously undermine your dreams. Their negativity will eventually make you doubt your dreams too. Find people who help you believe in yourself and your goals.5. Cultivate GratitudeGratitude strengthens your will power. It keeps you focused on what's working well, which allows you to take actions confidently without letting your fears get in the way. Gratitude is available to all people. Whether you are sick or well, young or old, as long as you had a meal today, and your heart is beating, you've got something to be grateful for.People who always feel grateful are the most successful people in life. They view the world as a place full of opportunities, despite their circumstances.Choose to be grateful no matter your situation. And count the opportunity to pursue your dream as a blessing.Prove to yourself that you can do it.You can do so by staying focused on your dream.Slowly and steadily, keep cultivating a growth mindset, confidence in your dream, delayed gratification, healthy relationships, and being grateful.Because there is no such thing as being born with success; it's all about grit and sticking with it.And if you do, you'll experience firsthand the beauty of achieving your dream.You deserve to succeed.So start taking action today.Ann Davis is on a mission to help people succeed at fulfilling their dreams.

Most others have been killed in clashes with security forces.Almost daily Palestinian stabbing, car-rammings and shooting attacks have killed 20 Israelis and a U.S. citizen, raising fears of a wider escalation a decade after the lastPalestinian uprising subsided.In the latest fatal incident, the Israeli military said a Palestinian rammed his car into Israeli soldiers at a West Bank checkpoint. ""Forces responded to the imminent danger and fired towards the perpetrator,"" the military said, adding that one soldier had been wounded and evacuated to hospital.The 56-year-old Palestinian man died after being taken to hospital, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.The Palestinians disputed the Israeli military's account of the incident. Jamil Dawoud, 49, said he was traveling in the car behind the one of the man shot, at the checkpoint where soldiers were inspecting the vehicles and that the soldier who opened fire appeared to misunderstand what had happened.""There were three soldiers. One soldier signaled for the man to come forward, a soldier was on the edge of the road and he tried to move backward when he slipped. The second soldier opened fire, firing four bullets at the man, after that they tried to give him first aid,"" Dawoud said.Hours earlier police officers shot dead a Palestinian who tried to stab a policeman near Jerusalem's walled Old City.Officers approached a man they said was following Jewish worshippers, spokeswoman Luba Samri said, and asked to see his identification papers. ""The terrorist whipped out a knife and tried to stab a police officer.

Most others have been killed in clashes with security forces.Almost daily Palestinian stabbing, car-rammings and shooting attacks have killed 20 Israelis and a U.S. citizen, raising fears of a wider escalation a decade after the lastPalestinian uprising subsided.In the latest fatal incident, the Israeli military said a Palestinian rammed his car into Israeli soldiers at a West Bank checkpoint. ""Forces responded to the imminent danger and fired towards the perpetrator,"" the military said, adding that one soldier had been wounded and evacuated to hospital.The 56-year-old Palestinian man died after being taken to hospital, the Palestinian Health Ministry said.The Palestinians disputed the Israeli military's account of the incident. Jamil Dawoud, 49, said he was traveling in the car behind the one of the man shot, at the checkpoint where soldiers were inspecting the vehicles and that the soldier who opened fire appeared to misunderstand what had happened.""There were three soldiers. One soldier signaled for the man to come forward, a soldier was on the edge of the road and he tried to move backward when he slipped. The second soldier opened fire, firing four bullets at the man, after that they tried to give him first aid,"" Dawoud said.Hours earlier police officers shot dead a Palestinian who tried to stab a policeman near Jerusalem's walled Old City.Officers approached a man they said was following Jewish worshippers, spokeswoman Luba Samri said, and asked to see his identification papers.

The flag, long a symbol of racism and bigotry, was taken down from Columbia’s statehouse flagpole in July following the killing of nine black church goers by a 21-year-old white supremacist. As part of the flag’s being furled, a resolution was passed to display it in a museum.On Tuesday, the Confederate Relic Room and Military Museum Commission voted to spend up to $3.6 million to display the flag and other civil war memorabilia. The amount was a reduction from $5.3 million that the commission had originally agreed to spend on the display, with more than half a million dollars going to repair a leaky roof by the entrance, The Charlotte Observer reports.The expansion of the Relic Room, where the flag will be housed, would increase the size of the museum by about one-third. State Rep. Chris Corley (R-Aiken) called the plan irresponsible.""You take the flag down and then all of a sudden you’re going to put this huge amount of money into the Confederate Relic Room,"" Corley said. ""It’s a trade-off and I do not like doing business like that.”Corley added that the money should instead be used to repair roads and structures damaged by October floods.“This may blow everybody’s mind and throw everybody for a loop, but I am not voting for that much money to go into it,"" Corley said of the flag display. The state legislature will discuss the changed proposal in the new year."

You can see past features here. To stay up to date with future posts, sign-up here.  Growing up some people just know that they want to become entrepreneurs. They dream about one day starting their own company and growing it into a profitable one. For Sean Conway, entrepreneurship was in his blood. Growing up in a household where his parents were both entrepreneurs, Sean knew from an early age that he wanted to be an entrepreneur as well. So starting at the age of 15, he started reading all the business books he could get his hands on. This early passion for entrepreneurship would pay-off as Sean would start his first company Notehall right after college. Notehall is an online marketplace that allows college students to buy and sell class materials. Notehall would eventually get acquired by Chegg, and Sean would start his second company Pillow Homes, a hospitality platform for short-term living rentals, giving homeowners a pre-determined minimum monthly income from their short-term rentals. I got to sit down and chat with Sean about his startup journey, the early struggles, the challenges he faced, the lessons he learned and more.How Notehall was born - Index Cards  The initial idea for Notehall came about when Sean saw this student at the University of Arizona selling index cards for $10 each. He shared, ""Then one of my club members told me that he wanted to put notes online and I was like 'omg, that's it. Selling notes online'.""Right at that moment, Sean decided to just take a leap of faith, buy a domain name and get started. However, Sean and his co-founder didn't really have any coding experience so they needed to raise money to finance the product development and starting costs. Initially, Sean and his cofounder raised $15k each from their family and friends to get them started. Sean recalls struggling to make ends meet during the early days of the company especially since they couldn't really find any investors since they didn't have much of a track record.The 75 Alumni Cold Calls  Searching for funding sources, Sean decided to pick up the alumni contact list of the University of Arizona and start calling the top donors one by one. He shared, ""I got a lot of people to answer, but I ended up with only 3 meetings and no funding.""While he may not have gotten funding, Sean's grit, hustle and persistence would help Notehall get into the DreamIt Ventures Accelerator program, get funding and eventually grow Notehall to profitability. Early Challenges  He shared, ""I think one of the biggest challenges was going ahead. It wasn't much of the users just trying to figure out this world of the web when you're not a computer scientist, and trying to understand which metrics matter and how you document them.""Sean shared how DreamIt really helped him learn how to focus on the right metrics. However, it was still a challenge having to develop multiple features and tools to help them acquire more users. Sean shared, ""We had to hire these developers for barely anything because we were in a bootstrap budget so we had to convince them to join us even if we didn't really have much experience.""In order to overcome these first few developers, Sean had to make sure that the developers he was bringing in were having fun and enjoyed working on Notehall. He shared, ""At the end of the day, we were all in it as a team together. They would be developing and I would be working on it as a team together at 11 pm at night and I would be seated right next to them. Then we would grab a 12 pack of beer and enjoy it together."" Notehall got the chance to pitch at Shark TankThe Tipping Point  When Notehall was going through DreamIt, they initially focused on building their business around lecture notes. However, they would realize that nobody really wanted lecture notes. Most students wanted study guides and study notes and 85% of the company's revenue came from there. This was something the team only realized halfway through the semester so they had to regroup. While Sean and the Notehall team initially thought that they had to give free notes to everyone who signed up, the reality was they only needed to give it to the first five persons who accessed the document since that was enough for them to review it and get other people to start purchasing the document.Sean shared, ""We stopped the freemium model where we were giving everyone free notes. During finals week, it really turned on and we started doubling our revenue every semester after that and until the third semester.""Education company Chegg started noticing this growth and started checking in on Notehall. At this point, Notehall was beating their revenue projections and meeting their numbers. Chegg Acquires Notehall  While Sean didn't build Notehall with the purpose of selling it to a bigger company, Chegg kept knocking at the door until Sean decided that it was best for Notehall to sell. While Chegg initially came in with a $3-4M offer that Sean decided to turn down because Notehall was about to raise another round of financing at an $8M valuation, Chegg founder Ayush would call him up right before he decided to sign the new term sheet.Sean was at an education conference at that time when Ayush would fly to the conference and ask Sean to have dinner with him. In this dinner, Ayush and Sean were negotiating the right price for Notehall. And finally, after a few back and forth, when the price was right, Sean decided to take it.Sean shared, ""It was like one of the weirdest moments of my life. I didn't think I was going to sell the company until the very end. It was an amazing but very awkward feeling."" The Pillow Homes teamThe Birth of Pillow Homes  After Notehall got acquired, Sean would travel across the world in search of his next adventure. He shared, ""I love to travel. I think the more people travel, the more they become their best person. I'm my best person when I travel.""Sean shared with me his experience of visiting the Philippines and interacting with the locals. He expounded, ""The smile is universal from country to country to country. I think people in America don't know how lucky they are and they don't understand other cultures. This breeds a lot of problems and controversy in the world.""Sean emphasized how traveling helps you gain more empathy and understand what causes problems. He added, ""I want to help more people travel from a real point of view, where you're interacting with locals and your neighbors and immersing yourself in the culture.""It was during this experience of traveling around the world when he saw the impact of Airbnb. At the same time, he also saw a supply issue where people were willing to rent out their homes but didn't how to manage it. This led to the birth of Pillow Homes, which combines the on-demand economy and property management. While Sean had a hard time raising money for Notehall, this wouldn't be the case for Pillow Homes. Sean would get back together with his Notehall cofounder, hire a few developers and raise over $2.6M. The Realities of Starting a Startup  While Sean is on his way to building his second company, he emphasized how 99% of press articles on the media don't really show you the realities of starting a startup. He shared, ""It's really really hard and people never get it the first time. It's tough, but it's worthwhile. It's one of the most gratifying experiences ever once you see your dream and vision come alive. As long as you have delayed gratification beyond the vast majority of people and if you're a really good fisherman and you sit there for two months and you learn how to catch your fish, that's what it's like.""Sean recalled the days he would setup a tent in schools staying in the halls until 9 pm trying to get people to signup to Notehall. He recalled the days they would work even on Sundays when they were going through the DreamIt accelerator. He recalled the days when he would rent out his apartment for Pillow so they could better understand their customers. Indeed, a lot of it boiled down to patience, grit and a lot of sacrifices.Sean shared with me how he doesn't get to hang out as much with his friends anymore and he spends most of his time with his team but in the end, it's worth it. He added, ""That's what most new entrepreneurs don't know. It can't be about the money. You have to do it because you truly love your idea and it's something you truly believe in. That's the passion you need to have because that's the only thing that gets you through the down terms.""It's now Sean's goal to turn Pillow into a global living network and the best hospitality management platform.
