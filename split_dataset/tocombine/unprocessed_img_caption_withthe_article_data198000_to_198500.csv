The 30-year-old superstar showed off her smokin' hot post-baby body in a figure-hugging red Alice Temperly dress as she supported her husband Jay-Z at the first of his two benefit concerts at Carnegie Hall. We love that it has only been a month since Bey gave birth and she's already rocking a tight jersey dress. Bravo! The ""Bootylicious"" singer also wore embellished Christian Louboutin heels and a gold Alexander McQueen clutch. And Baby Blue definitely wasn't far from her mind. Beyonce finished her look with a big blue cocktail ring and blue nail polish. Proud papa Jay-Z dedicated the concert to their daughter and after singing ""Glory,"" the song he wrote for Blue Ivy, the rapper confessed:""I didn't think I was going to make it through that one. That was tough.""Check out the slideshow below to see all the hot-mama pics Bey posted to her website--doesn't she look fabulous?"

When you're mindful, you observe your thoughts and feelings from a distance, without judging them good or bad. Instead of letting your life pass you by, mindfulness means living in the moment and awakening to experience.""The American Psychological Association suggests counting blessings instead of burdens: ""... Positive emotions broaden mindsets and build enduring personal resources. These resources function as reserves to be drawn on in times of need.""And sleep is a total mood changer. The National Institute of Health says:""When healthy adults are given unlimited opportunity to sleep, they sleep on average between 8 and 8.5 hours a night. But sleep needs vary from person to person. Some people appear to need only about 7 hours to avoid problem sleepiness, whereas others need 9 or more hours of sleep. Sleep needs also change throughout the life cycle.""On the seventh day of 29 days of ""Go Red"" blog posts, this heart blogger looks forward to the New York Giants parade at 11 a.m. EST in NYC (and the related overall reduction in mortality the Giants won for their fans). Patriots fans, take good care of yourselves -- fans of losing teams in major sporting events have been known to experience higher risks of heart attacks for a couple weeks following an emotional championship game.
