Despite the noon Eastern start time, the match drew in enough viewers to score a 6.7 U.S. household rating -- the second-highest rating and third-most viewed ever for a men’s World Cup match on ESPN, according to the press release issued by the network. Online, ESPN was even more popular. The release says 1.7 million concurrent viewers were logged on to WatchESPN. That's more than the number that signed in to watch the most recent Super Bowl, Forbes reports. Read the full press release here.  The spike in viewership -- to which workplaces around the nation no doubt contributed -- was so great it crashed ESPN's streaming service during the first half of the match. Spanish-language Univision, meanwhile, boasted to Techcrunch.com that their live stream ""absolutely did not experience any outages” when a record 750,000 concurrent viewers were logged on to their free internet stream. The World Cup has proved to be a ratings bonanza for the networks, thanks to both the tournament's Prime Time scheduling and American's soaring interest in soccer. Sunday's 6 p.m. Eastern USA-Portugal match was seen by a record-breaking 18.2 million viewers making it the most-viewed soccer game in American history. "
1,POLITICS,Stop the Next Iraq War Before It Starts,"William Hartung, ContributorWriter and Foreign Policy Expert",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/stop-the-next-iraq-war-be_b_5537774.html,"President Obama has promised not to send ""combat troops"" to Iraq, but it's hard to see how the U.S. military personnel he is sending there can avoid combat, given that they are being dropped into the middle of a civil war.",2014-06-27,"FILE - This June 19, 2014, file photo shows President Barack Obama pausing as he talks will about the situation in Iraq at the White House in Washington. Obama acknowledged the risks of mission creep when he outlined plans to help Iraq combat the Islamic insurgency that has made gains with lighting speed, but he pledged that the U.S. will not be ""dragged back"" into a lengthy conflict or become ensnarled in ""mission creep."" The deployments mark a sharp shift for a president who oversaw the full withdrawal of American forces from Iraq in late 2011 after Washington and Baghdad failed to reach an agreement to keep a few thousand troops in place. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ce4b200000f90101d059.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"President Obama wants you to know that he has no intention of going to war in Iraq, even as U.S. military personnel arrived in Iraq this week to begin their mission of advising the Iraqi military on how to be more effective in its fight against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The president has promised not to send ""combat troops"" to Iraq, but it's hard to see how the U.S. military personnel he is sending there can avoid combat, given that they are being dropped into the middle of a civil war.First off, just because the U.S. forces call themselves advisers doesn't mean that they will be out of harm's way. The current plan is to station U.S. troops at joint operating centers that are supposed to be far from the front lines. But the front lines in the war are fluid, and could move into areas where U.S. troops are going to be based. Furthermore, if U.S. personnel are to make an accurate assessment of the state of the Iraqi military, it will be tempting to send at least some of them to combat zones to get an up-close look at the fighting. And if ISIS fighters shoot at U.S. advisers, they will be compelled to take on a combat role whether they want to or not. This in turn may lead to an increase in U.S. forces in Iraq to protect those who are already there. The distinction between advisers and combat troops may quickly disappear.And it's not just ISIS that U.S. forces will have to worry about. Associates of Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, whose militias fought the U.S. military when it was stationed in Iraq, have threatened to attack any U.S. personnel who return to the country. And if that's not bad enough, three current and former CIA officials told Newsweek that Iraqi government military personnel are likely to spy on U.S. advisers and share that information with their allies in Iran.The greatest danger of sending U.S. advisers to Iraq is that they are likely to be just the first wave of a larger intervention. One of their main missions will be to identify bombing targets, thereby increasing the likelihood of U.S. air strikes. And once they assess the needs of the Iraqi military, more U.S. arms transfers and additional trainers are likely to follow closely behind.All of this activity will be carried out against the backdrop of accelerating sectarian violence. Reports from Baghdad indicate that Shiite militias have begun to kidnap and kill Sunni residents who have no connection to ISIS, just because they are Sunni. Meanwhile, in the north, armed Sunni groups have formed a tactical alliance with ISIS in hopes of overthrowing the al-Maliki regime. The Obama administration has called for a more inclusive government in Baghdad, but al-Maliki is still in power, and U.S. military involvement has already begun. Washington is now on al-Maliki's side whether it wants to be perceived that way or not.Events are moving rapidly in Iraq. Before the Obama administration gets involved any further, Congress and the public should be consulted. Nearly three-quarters of Americans think the last Iraq war was a mistake. Let's not repeat it by sliding into a new military intervention in Iraq under the guise of sending advisers."

Republican lawmakers criticized potential security flaws in the U.S. health exchanges as Obama administration officials said they have made protecting customer privacy a top priority in their efforts to fix the website. Photographer: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ce4b2500008e013a51cd.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The IRS has been under loud scrutiny as of late by House Republicans regarding the agency's role in targeting conservative-leaning political nonprofit groups applying for tax exempt status. Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA) has led the charge in these fiery hearings, earlier this week accusing IRS Commissioner John Koskinen of ""game playing"" by failing to produce key emails from a senior IRS official. Ranking minority Committee member Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD) provided a very different account of the entire episode, apologizing to Koskinen for having to ""go through this hell."" All of this political gamesmanship is, however, a distraction, from the real issue facing the Internal Revenue Service -- funding. Many Americans dislike the IRS and will paint you a vivid picture of the tax man knocking down your door for a slice of your hard earnings. Those Americans might be surprised to learn that the current IRS annual enforcement budget has been cut to about $11.3 billion. As a comparison, that's less than the $14 billion Apple Inc. used to buyback its own stock in one month this past February, a move that only serves to provide meager benefits to its shareholders. The IRS simply does not have the budget to do its lawful job effectively, which is to collect revenue for the U.S. government. What does that mean for taxpayers?According to an April article from The Associated Press: ""This year, the IRS will have fewer agents auditing returns than at any time since at least the 1980s."" The IRS loses an estimated $300 billion a year due to tax evasion -- a key contributor to deficits. A proposal by the Obama Administration claims that the IRS could bring in an additional $6 for every dollar it adds to the enforcement budget. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen, a highly regarded veteran public servant, said that he pushes this rather convincing point in Congress to little reception or reaction. ""I say that and everybody shrugs and goes on about their business,"" he told AP. ""I have not figured out either philosophically or psychologically why nobody seems to care whether we collect the revenue or not."" Congress certainly seem to care when it comes to heated party politics, however. The U.S. tax code has long been perforated by corporate lobbyists and corporate tax attorneys whose primary purpose is to circumvent its laws so that their profit-rich companies can avoid paying their fair share to Uncle Sam. In many states, it is a literal race-to-the-bottom for elected officials to offer corporations sweeter tax deals to keep jobs in-state, as illustrated by the Boeing controversy in Washington State earlier this year. Notably, besides getting a state tax holiday, Boeing paid zero in federal income tax on large U.S. based profits last year -- along with many other major U.S. corporations such as GE and Verizon. Some of these Fortune 500 companies even get a rebate check! (See ""The Sorry State of Corporate Taxes"" report from Citizens for Tax Justice. )And of course multimillionaires and billionaires, by taking full advantage of tax loopholes, deductions, deferrals and other forms of creative accounting, often pay less in taxes than middle-class Americans. Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan that passed the House of Representatives earlier this year would shamelessly benefit the wealthy elite with even more tax cuts at a time of rising mass poverty.The end result is that the wealthy 1 percent continues to profit hand-over-fist using public resources and infrastructure while the 99 percent pay the bills for it -- all the while struggling to pay their own bills, mortgages, student loans, and more. And when Wall Street runs amok, it's the taxpayers who must pay the bills for the catastrophic damage resulting from regulatory slumber, as we saw back in 2009.It's abundantly clear that significant, transformative tax reform is necessary. What remains unclear is who will benefit the most from such reform. Americans from both the left and right must seriously ask why individual U.S. taxpayers are fronting the money for hugely profitable corporations -- the right calls it ""crony capitalism"" and the left calls it ""corporate welfare."" Both agree that it is a serious problem. This is taxpayer money that could potentially be used to repair critical public infrastructure, create decent paying jobs, or, simply, to reduce the tax burden on individuals. (See my new book Unstoppable: The Emerging Left-Right Alliance to Dismantle the Corporate State.) One solution to ensure that the interests of small taxpayers are accounted for and protected is to establish taxpayer watchdog associations across the country. These organizations would work full-time in each state to make sure that individual taxpayers get the best deal possible. After all, big corporations can afford to support an army of tax accountants and attorneys to continually update the playbook of tactics to avoid having to pay their share. Most taxpayers don't have this luxury. What they do have, however, is sheer force of numbers. Organization of such watchdog organizations could be as easy as a notice on the 1040 tax return and state tax forms inviting people to join. These non-profit advocacy groups would be supported by modest membership dues and would receive no tax money. The members would elect a board of directors that could hire researchers, organizers, accountants and lawyers to work as taxpayer champions.Such pressure from united citizens would provide an avenue to enhance the influence of individuals and small businesses in a fairer, more efficient tax collection and policy-making process -- something that is much needed in our current American oligarchy. Perhaps even Republicans like wealthy Cong. Darrell Issa could see the benefit of having such groups actively watchdogging for the people.A simple motto to consider when asking what we choose to tax is: ""Tax what they burn before we tax what we earn."" Before we place the largest burdens of taxation on workers, we should tax areas that have the most potential negative or damaging influence on our economy and our society. Tax the polluters, the addictive products industry, the Wall Street speculators, the junk food peddlers, and the corporate criminals. Consider this: A fraction of a 1 percent sales tax on high velocity speculation in derivatives and trading in stocks could bring in $300 billion a year!If taxpayers really want to protect their interests, they must organize and fight for themselves. The corporations certainly have the money -- but they can't match the envoy of an engaged citizenry, especially one that is informed and turns out to vote.

Earhart (1898 - 1937) disappeared without trace over the Pacific Ocean in her attempt to fly around the world in 1937.

He took me to the edge of the 880-foot-long Thompson Graving Dock, where RMS Titanic was hauled to check and clean its hull and fit the propellers. It was the last place she sat on dry ground.Standing on the edge of this naked 44-foot-deep footprint I got a sense of how huge the ship was, or at least it allowed imagining. Colin, a self-professed Titanorak, brought it home sharing that the dock could hold 21 million gallons of water, or, in terms better understood in Ireland, 168 million pints of Guinness. Back home in California I recently got a call from Colin. He now heads something called The Stratus Project, which is set to find the plane Amelia Earhart was flying when she disappeared attempting to circumnavigate the world in 1937. There have been rafts of searches for her Lockheed Electra, all in vain. The Stratus Project claims new information previously overlooked, pointing to a search area Colin believes to be the location of the Electra. If he's right, it could solve one of the greatest mysteries in human history. After she flew the Atlantic solo in 1932, landing in a farmer's field in Londonderry, Northern Ireland, Amelia Earhart became the most famous woman in the world. So, five years later it gripped the world when she vanished. At the time it seemed almost incomprehensible that such a legend could merely run out of fuel and crash into the ocean. Theories flew like popcorn, ranging from the famous aviatrix being captured by the Japanese, to her landing on Gardner Island and dying as a castaway, even a theory that she returned to the U.S. and lived under an assumed identity. Colin subscribes to Occam's razor, that the simplest solution is the likeliest... that Earhart ran out of fuel while searching for Howland Island and crashed into the Pacific Ocean.The Stratus approach is based on an understanding of techniques used by navigator Fred Noonan, especially celestial navigation. I ask Colin where the plane is, and he says that due to the competitive nature of the Earhart search, he can't tell me. Unless I sign a non-disclosure agreement.The Lockheed Electra used for the World Flight was the first all-metal plane, and specially modified for long distance, with the 10 passenger seats in the cabin removed and replaced by 12 fuel tanks. The refitted plane had a theoretical range of 4,000 miles. Here is one of the places Amelia landed on her final flight. Can you guess where it is? It was an advanced aircraft for the time, with variable pitch propellers and retractable landing gear, and Amelia's had a Bendix radio direction finder with a loop coupler above the cockpit, and a Western Electric transmitter. The cabin windows were blacked out and in the back of the plane a navigation station was added along with a special window for Noonan to use celestial navigation.Frederick Noonan was Pan Am's chief navigator when he left to join Earhart's World Flight as the sole companion, and Colin thinks the answers lie in recreating Noonan's likely analysis and flight path directions. The fatal flight began in Oakland, California, and pointed south and east, following a route that stitched around the Equator for some 27,000 miles. She made it as far as Lae, New Guinea (where I once stood looking eastward into the void). Earhart departed Lae at 00:00 GMT July 2 with 1,100 gallons of fuel on-board. Distance to Howland, a sand spit 1.5 mile long, was 2,222 nautical miles. With no headwinds, the minimum flight time would have been 17:05 hours. Radio communications were few and unclear, and after a message at 20:13 Earhart was never heard from again. She never landed on Howland. The cutter Itasca, stationed off Howland, began what would become the largest US search in history for a missing person. On July 18th the US Navy gave up. No sign of Earhart, Noonan or the Electra has ever been found.Colin intends to conduct his Amelia Earhart search near Howland Island, where the water is as much as 18,000 feet deep. Status is planning on using a full ocean depth autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), using sonar to locate targets on the seabed. ""Finding Earhart's Electra would be the greatest discovery since the Titanic,"" Colin says. ""When I was a boy I dreamt of discovery and venturing into the unknown.

Ms. Barra has testified twice before the Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, where I serve as the Ranking Democrat. While I have had (and continue to have) substantive concerns about Ms. Barra's answers to me and the actions of her company, I never once thought that her gender or her family had anything to do with these questions.  Nor should I.  Tens of millions of parents go to work every day and dedicate themselves to their jobs without sacrificing an ounce of love for their children. I have been proud to serve my constituents in Colorado's First Congressional District while raising two smart, independent, and loving daughters with my husband. And while the demands of my job didn't always make things easy, I felt I could do right by the people I serve and the children I love so much.  I have every confidence Ms. Barra feels the same way about her career and kids, and rightfully so.  Loving parents are often accomplished professionals as well. While we balance two very different but demanding roles, many of us do both, and do them well. This is true of people in different professions, with various family situations, and of both mothers and fathers. By 2014, most of us appreciate all of this, but in spite of our common acceptance of the jobs that both mothers and fathers can be present at work and at home, NBC's Matt Lauer asked Ms. Barra a series of questions that belong to a long-passed generation. Instead of asking about GM's activities while it sold unsafe cars, Mr. Lauer chose to ask Ms. Barra if her gender helped her get ahead, or if she couldn't lead the company because she is a mother.  Mr. Lauer was wrong, and he should have known better.  The idea that Ms. Barra had an easy ascent up GM's corporate ladder is absurd; otherwise, the company's first female CEO would have come along well before now. And professional women -- Ms. Barra included -- are not given free passes; instead, we often face absurd questions about divided loyalties or assumptions that we have some skewed perception because we are also active parents. Mr. Lauer implied in his questions that Ms. Barra was somehow unfit as a leader because she is a mother, or that she should experience different feelings as an executive because she has children. Such ridiculous questions would never be asked of a father or male executive, much less in an interview on a national broadcast network. Mr. Lauer should recognize as much and apologize to both Ms. Barra and his viewers.   There are plenty of legitimate questions on which to press Ms. Barra; I have asked my fair share of them and will continue to. What Mr. Lauer asked had no place in modern discourse. It disrespects parents and professionals alike."

LinkedIn's stock has nearly quadrupled in value from its $45 IPO price two years ago.

LinkedIn works very well for the millions of people who make the effort to understand how to leverage it effectively. And those people are very likely not spending more than fifteen a minutes a day on LinkedIn, once they have a solid, complete Profile.Done right, your next job could find you...LinkedIn Job Search MistakesLinkedIn understands what recruiters are looking for (recruiters are the main revenue source!), so they help you feed recruiters the information they want. 1. An empty -- or skimpy -- LinkedIn Profile.Cram your Summary full of the things you have done in your work life that you are proudest of and that are relevant to the job you want next. Your Summary should be a keyword-rich description of you and your accomplishments (quantified whenever possible). Describe your what you have done -- related to your current job search goals -- and what you want to do next. LinkedIn offers sections for Experience -- your relevant work history, including any volunteering you have done that supports your goal. Employers and recruiters often also look for Recommendations, Certifications, and Languages. Adding these sections to your Profile, as appropriate, can help make your level of expertise very visible as well as adding more great keywords.NOTE: When you are describing your accomplishments and achievements, don't limit yourself to your current (or most recent) job.If you helped your local food bank develop a better planning process when you volunteered there two years ago, include it! As long as those accomplishments prove that you are qualified for that next job you want, include as many as you have room for.2. No head shot photo on the Profile.Nothing labels you as clueless or your LinkedIn Profile as fake or abandoned like the lack of a photo identifying the member. If you think that omitting the photo will minimize discrimination, think again.When recruiters are looking through LinkedIn search results, Profiles with head shots are eleven times (1,100 percent!) more likely to be visited.  People looking for new connections also prefer Profiles with photos, too. That's just human nature. We are all ""wired"" to respond to faces. With a photo on your Profile, you'll also be much easier for former colleagues or friends from the past to recognize. Just you -- no kids, pets, or partners.3. A generic, useless, keyword-less Professional Headline.A vague Professional Headline provide no clues about what you do, contains few (or, no) keywords, and will attract no interest! Your Professional Headline should describe your future -- your goal for that next job, not your past -- when you are job hunting. To provide those all-important keywords, it should be as specific as possible. You aren't writing this in concrete -- it can change if needed in the future (even if the future is next week)!Too many LinkedIn Professional Headlines are vague (e.g. ""Operations Manager""), and, thus, lack essential keywords that bring employer and recruiters to your Profile. On the other hand, ""Data Center Operations Manager, Finance/Banking Industry, Experienced with SysTrust, OTC Support, and Cyber Security"" provides great keywords (assuming they are true)!4. Inactivity. Post something intelligent and relevant at least once a week in the Updates section of your Profile's home page. More often is better! Updates will be seen by all of your connections. And, remember that -- unless turned off -- your contributions and comments in LinkedIn Groups will also show up in your Updates stream.5. Missing the opportunities provided by Groups.LinkedIn Groups are available for locations, professions, industries, hobbies, employers, and countless other ideas and things that people share. Typically, Group Discussions provide opportunities both to learn and to share good information, including your own work.More than two million Groups exist, and each LinkedIn member may belong to up to 50 Groups. When you are in a job search, join that maximum. It's very easy to ""un-join"" whenever you want to leave. You are much easier for recruiters to contact (and, note, vice versa!) since Group members can send each other ""private"" messages without being connected on LinkedIn otherwise!6. Having a low number of LinkedIn Connections.The more connections you have, the greater your visibility into and inside the LinkedIn community. Try to add one or two new connections every week. With more connections comes more credibility. When you have few connections, you look like a LinkedIn ""newbie"" or, possibly, like your Profile may be fake. Once you hit the ""500+"" Connections mark, you will look like the vast majority of LinkedIn members, your credibility and reality confirmed, and the number of connections you have will no longer be visible or particularly relevant.7. Not acting like a grown-up.LinkedIn does require active participation to be effective, and, the more active you are, the more visible you are. Keep that activity positive and professional. Communicate clearly and well (demonstrating your skill in written communication) and nicely and politely (unless you are looking for a job as a nasty person). A recent study of recruiter use of LinkedIn found that 93 percent of recruiters (who regularly use LinkedIn) used LinkedIn to ""keep tabs on"" job candidates while 92 percent used it to ""vet candidates."" So, recruiters are paying attention to your LinkedIn activitiesBottom LineEven if you are very happy in your job, stay active on LinkedIn. Know anyone who really has a ""permanent job"" these days? Non-existent! Using LinkedIn, recruiters find good candidates, get to know them a bit, and approach them with job opportunities when the right opportunity develops rather than posting a job and being inundated with applications from unqualified applicants. Of course, your mileage may vary, but, for most industries and professions, time invested in LinkedIn is usually time well spent.More about LinkedIn:To learn what your best keywords are and how to effectively leverage them in LinkedIn and your other social profiles, see Be Found to Be Hired: the 20 Best Keywords for Your Job Search.

It is also a reminder that support as well as opposition to civil liberty these days can come from unexpected quarters. Or maybe it is no longer much of a surprise that our constitutional law professor turned president cares so little for the protections enumerated in the Bill of Rights.In an opinion endorsed by all factions on the court, Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. summarily rejected the assertion of the Obama Justice Department and the liberal Attorney General of California, defending that state's top court's view, that a warrantless search of the vast data contained on a cell phone is comparable to looking into a detainees cigarette pack or reading a few pages tucked into his pocket. Limited searches that the court has previously accepted as consistent with the Fourth Amendment. Instead of treating ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures"" as an irrelevant antiquity of the pre-computer age Roberts turned the argument on its head insisting that a cell phone's data requires greater constitutional protection because the personal information it contains is so vast. As Roberts wrote in dismissing the U.S. Justice Department and California's equation of cell phone data to previously acceptable incidental body searches:That is like saying a ride on horseback is materially indistinguishable from a flight to the moon. Both are ways of getting from point A to point B, but little else justifies lumping them together. Modern cell phones, as a category, implicate privacy concerns far beyond those implicated by the search of a cigarette pack, a wallet, or a purse...Before cell phones, a search of a person was limited by physical realities and tended as a general matter to constitute only a narrow intrusion on privacy... Today, by contrast, it is no exaggeration to say that many of the more than 90% of Americans who own a cell phone keep on their person a digital record of nearly every aspect of their lives -- from the mundane to the intimate.The modern cell phone is a mobile file cabinet of all of the personal data once stored in a home that the Fourth Amendment was designed to protect. Writing of the cellphone Roberts argued for the unanimous majority: ""They could just as easily be called cameras, video players, Rolodexes, calendars, tape recorders, libraries, diaries, albums, televisions, maps or newspapers."" The implications of this pro-privacy ruling at a time of the exposure of a vast government surveillance regime centered at the NSA are obvious. All of that troubling cell phone data is a relatively small fraction of what the NSA scoops up employing precisely the general warrants that the Fourth Amendment was designed to prohibit. While it is certainly questionable whether Roberts will lead the court into applying that prohibition to the modern surveillance state logical consistency would demand it.What is truly radical about the court's unanimous endorsement of Roberts's opinion is that it asserts the primacy of privacy in the survival of the American political experiment in representative governance. Responding to the Obama Administrations suggestion that law enforcement agencies ""develop protocols to address"" privacy concerns raised by the vast amounts of private data stored on cloud computers Roberts responded ""Probably a good idea, but the founders did not fight a revolution to gain the right to government agency protocols."" Presumably they also didn't fight the revolution to transfer their rights to FISA courts whose judges Roberts appoints. Perhaps he trusts his own motives in such matters but the basic message of the constitution is to fundamentally mistrust those in power. That much Roberts does recognize in his classic conclusion that is bound to resonate over time:Our cases have recognized that the Fourth Amendment was the founding generation's response to the reviled ""general warrants"" and ""writs of assistance"" of the colonial era, which allowed British officers to rummage through homes in an unrestrained search for evidence of criminal activity. Opposition to such searches was in fact one of the driving forces behind the revolution itself. In 1761, the patriot James Otis delivered a speech in Boston denouncing the use of writs of assistance. A young John Adams was there, and he would later write that 'every man of a crowded audience appeared to me to go away, as I did, ready to take arms against writs of assistance.' According to Adams, Otis's speech was 'the first scene of the first act of opposition to the arbitrary claims of Great Britain. Then and there the child Independence was born.' Now, about the NSA and its rummaging, might Edward Snowden come to be viewed as the contemporary James Otis?"

The 53-year-old preacher deported from Britain who faces terrorism charges in his native Jordan has appealed to al-Qaida fighters in Syria to unite their ranks and end infighting. He spoke during a hearing Tuesday, Dec. 24, 2013, appealing to the two main al-Qaida factions in Syria â the Nusra Front and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant â to offer ""unequivocal submissiveness"" to al-Qaida's chief, Ayman al-Zawahri.(AP Photo/Matt Dunham, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc1392a2400004f0024e7fa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"* Court acquits Abu Qatada over lack of evidence* Upholds confession that convicted Qatada in absentia* Muslim cleric faces another hearing in September (Adds color, lawyer, rights activist, British comment)By Suleiman Al-KhalidiAMMAN, June 26 (Reuters) - A Jordanian court on Thursday acquitted radical Muslim cleric Abu Qatada, who was extradited from Britain last year, of charges of conspiring to commit acts of terrorism.But authorities will continue to detain the preacher because of separate charges related to a plot to attack tourists during Jordan's New Year celebrations in 2000.""The court announces the acquittal of the defendant for lack of evidence,"" said Ahmad Qatarneh, the judge presiding over the three-man military tribunal, which has drawn the criticism of human rights advocates.Abu Qatada, sitting on a bench in an enclosed iron dock, smiled and looked relaxed during the half-hour court session. Dressed in brown prison fatigues, he was flanked by black-clad security officers.Members of his family cried out for joy when the verdict was read and his wife and her relatives burst into tears.""Thanks and praise to God!"" they shouted.Abu Qatada had previously been sentenced in absentia by a Jordanian court to life imprisonment for conspiracy to carry out al Qaeda-style attacks against U.S. and other targets inside U.S. ally Jordan.Thursday's session was a retrial in which the prosecution had argued Abu Qatada was a mentor to militant cells in Jordan while he was in Britain, providing spiritual and material support to a campaign of violence during the late 1990s.But the court quashed the conspiracy charges and postponed another hearing on the New Year plot charges until Sept. 7.Abu Qatata's defense lawyer Ghazi Thunaibat said he hoped the second trial would bring a similar sentence.""My client has spent too long in prison unfairly and we hope the next verdict will finally end his plight and allow him to resume a normal life with his family,"" he told Reuters. DISPUTED CONFESSIONIn December, Thunaibat called for his client's release, saying his rights had been violated by the presence of the military judge in court and reliance on hearings of evidence extracted under torture from other defendants.Despite the acquittal, the court upheld a confession which had convicted Abu Qatada in absentia in the earlier trial. The defense said the confession had been extracted under torture.European and British courts used the confession to delay his deportation until he agreed to return to Jordan for a retrial.""Human Rights Watch is troubled by the verdict that made it permissible to include allegations of a confession made under coercion that was held in doubt by British courts and the European court of Human Rights,"" said Adam Coogle, a Human Rights Watch researcher who attended the session.Abu Qatada's return to Jordan was made possible by an extradition treaty adopted by Jordan and Britain that satisfied the concerns of British judges about the use of evidence obtained through torture..Jordan regularly arrests Islamist suspects and puts them on trial in military courts that rights groups say are illegal and lack proper legal safeguards. Jordan denies it convicts people using confessions extracted under duress.Linked by a Spanish judge to the late al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, Abu Qatada has been in and out of jail in Britain since 2001. He was extradited to Jordan in July last year.Jordanian security officials and experts on Islamist radical groups say Abu Qatada's ideological writings have influenced many youths involved with al Qaeda.""This is a man who the British courts have deemed a risk to national security. He is not coming back,"" British Prime Minister David Cameron's spokesman told reporters on Thursday.""He will not be granted permission to enter the UK, end of story. He was deported on an indefinite deportation order.""Abu Qatada has used some hearings to lend support to global al Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri in a row with a splinter group, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), which took control of swathes of land in Iraq this month and is in Syria.

United States and upheld a lower court decision in Hollingsworth v. Perry, striking down Proposition 8 and bringing marriage equality back to California. In an instant, the world changed forever.Like many people, I will never forget that day for as long as I live.Each day that week, I and hundreds of other marriage equality supporters went to the steps of the Supreme Court, hoping to be there when the rulings were announced. But nothing came on Monday or Tuesday, so we knew that the decisions in the DOMA and Prop. 8 cases would come down on the last day of the term: Wednesday, June 26.On Tuesday, as I reflected on the magnitude of what was about to take place, I realized that no matter how the Supreme Court ruled the next day, there was only one person I wanted by my side in that historic moment: my beloved husband Michael, with whom I'd been working for marriage equality on the state and national levels for the entire seven years of our own marriage. I asked him if he'd come down to the Court with me, and even though he was nervous about asking for time off at a job he'd just started, he said yes.On the morning of Decision Day, we grabbed our ""Married With Pride"" sign -- which we made back in 2008 for two rallies we helped organize in Wisconsin to protest the passage of Proposition 8 -- and headed down to the Supreme Court. I also grabbed my camera, thinking that I'd want to document the occasion.Just before 10 o'clock, a hush came over the massive crowd and the smartphones came out. All of us, demonstrators and reporters alike, now began frantically checking and refreshing SCOTUSblog, which we knew would be the quickest way of finding out what had happened.Suddenly the news flashed across my screen: Section 3 of DOMA, an unjust law and the source of daily heartbreak and humiliation for same-sex couples across the country, was no more. For a split second, I couldn't speak -- I just gasped, looked up to the sky, and closed my eyes. I didn't even need to speak; Michael knew from the look on my face exactly what had happened. But then I found the words: ""DOMA. It's gone. Unconstitutional.""As those words left my lips, the overwhelming magnitude of what was happening washed over me. For the first time in seven years of marriage, our country was saying to us, and thousands of married couples just like us -- I see you. I affirm you. The United States no longer viewed us as strangers, but as spouses.Michael and I felt amazement and disbelief and gratitude and relief, all at once. We burst into sobs and just held and kissed each other. Everything else fell away in that incredible moment: the crowd, the oppressive summer heat, the crush of reporters and the clicking of cameras. It felt, as Michael would later say, like a second wedding day. (Little did we know then that the DOMA ruling would set off a tsunami of freedom-to-marry court rulings across the country and allow thousands more couples to have their first wedding day!)The one thing I forgot to do that morning -- the one thing that ended up being furthest from my mind, in fact -- was to take pictures. I never even took my camera out of its case; it sat between my feet the entire time. But as fate would have it, I didn't need to: photographers captured our reaction to the rulings, and soon images of our intimate moments of joy were being shared with people all over the world, in outlets like the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, BBC and CNN. Friends in Canada, Germany, France, Switzerland, the Netherlands and even as far away as Thailand and China saw our sobbing faces on their phones, televisions and computer screens. And the next day, photos of us appeared on the front pages of at least 70 newspapers in the U.S. and Canada --- including my hometown newspaper, the Green Bay Press-Gazette -- and inside dozens of others.It was both surreal and humbling to see those photos, which captured the way so many of us felt on that Decision Day, go viral and become iconic images. Our hope -- then and now -- is that they speak to people and help them find room in their hearts to embrace the freedom to marry. If even one mind is changed about marriage equality, if even one heart is opened as a result of seeing our sweaty, joyful faces, it'll all have been worthwhile.Those are my memories from DOMA/Prop. 8 Decision Day 2013, one year ago today. Please share your own memories in the comments section. Where were you when the world changed?"

But given this 24/7 access to infinite information, why do most people still think success is all about being the smartest person in the room? You're meant for so much more.Years ago, I worked at a newspaper during a financial downturn. I was unsure about the future in a fading industry, with a boss who told me to work ""as if I had a gun to my head."" This wasn't what I had prepared my whole life for. For my first 20-something years I had been groomed to take on the world as a ""mover and shaker."" But I found myself suddenly out of a job and light years away from my potential. I thought if I worked ""harder and smarter"" than the next guy, things would work out. Now I had to admit to myself my success formula was flawed. If working harder and smarter wasn't enough, then what was? I started searching for answers with a Brazilian and a pair of Albanians, launching a network to empower people to lead, rather than lose to, the largest trends of the 21st century. We interviewed 300 CEOs, inventors, artists, and change agents in every field. What we found may surprise you. It surprised us. Here's the big idea: It's no longer about only working harder and smarter. The days of the Knowledge Worker and Information Age are over, and the days of the Connection Worker and Integration Age have begun. Now it's about working more creatively with everyone -- connecting more. How do we know? In January of 2011, engineers at IBM fused parts together in a Frankenstenian frenzy to unseat Ken Jennings, the Jeopardy! all-time winner. Their supercomputer, dubbed ""Watson,"" would need to share near-infinite trivia answers in milliseconds and in the form of a question to keep Alex Trebek smiling. But Jennings was confident he'd win against Watson, having practically put the ""Knowledge"" in Knowledge Worker. His Jedi-level training had led to his break on Jeopardy! , crushing opponents for 74 straight games, and taking home $2.5 million. This was no ordinary human, and Watson should rightly beware. On that fateful day, Jennings stood in IBM's auditorium next to Watson as programmers pumped their fists in the stands. Jennings was wary but unfazed:""I expected Watson's bag of cognitive tricks to be fairly shallow, but I felt an uneasy sense of familiarity as its programmers briefed us before the big match: The computer's techniques for unraveling Jeopardy! clues sounded just like mine. That machine zeroes in on key words in a clue, then combs its memory (in Watson's case, a 15-terabyte data bank of human knowledge) for clusters of associations with those words. It rigorously checks the top hits against all the contextual information it can muster: the category name; the kind of answer being sought; the time, place, and gender hinted at in the clue; and so on. And when it feels ""sure"" enough, it decides to buzz. This is all an instant, intuitive process for a human Jeopardy! player, but I felt convinced that under the hood my brain was doing more or less the same thing.""I made up ground against Watson by finding the first ""Daily Double"" clue, and began furiously hunting for the second one, which was my only hope for catching Watson. By process of elimination, I became convinced it was hiding in the ""Legal E's"" category, and, given a 50-50 chance between clues, chose the $1200 one. No dice. Watson took control of the board and chose ""Legal E's"" for $1600. There was the Daily Double. Game over for humanity....""  (""My Puny Brain"", Ken Jennings, Slate, 2/16/11, italics added)Once upon a time, we could expect to grow up, graduate from college, apply our newfound knowledge, and collect paychecks forever. But those days are gone. Knowledge is a commodity. It's no longer about knowing more. It's about connecting more.  Here's how: - Connect with an inspiring vision. Ponder, explore, and focus on what inspires most.  - Connect creatively with others. Inspire others by engaging in selfless and powerful ways.  - Connect others with success. Empower others to be successful, and they will love you for it. What does a Connection Worker look like? In October 2011, David Beckham got into an unexpected dust up. Beckham had led the L.A. Galaxy against Real Salt Lake and was now nearly in a fistfight with the opposing coach, Jason Kries. Beckham had approached Kreis to share his frustrations about an inept ref, but Kreis wasn't interested in engaging an opposing player, especially one who values his name more than the game. To Kreis, Beckham was the ultimate anathema: the guy who's only in it for himself.   For years, Kreis had preached to his players the power of selflessness. In a world where the Beckhams earn the most coin, get the paparazzi, and marry the Spice Girl, this might seem old-fashioned. But Kreis has made the conventional unconventional. In 2009, he started what most deemed the impossible dream: to make Real Salt Lake into more than a joke. Kreis believed success depended on connection -- to his heart, to his players, and to the game. Hired as the youngest coach in history at age 34, Kreis leveraged his inexperience as a strength. He called top coaches, praised them, explained his mission, invited them to dinner, and picked their brains. Next, Kreis built his team. While most coaches rely on scouts to bring in recruits, he insisted on meeting potential talent in person. And Kreis didn't want Rock Stars like Beckham. He wasn't interested in the player who'd light up the field only to bask in his own glory. No, Kreis wanted the opposite -- guys who loved the game and would give everything for the team to be successful. What happened next was nothing short of miraculous. Kreis converted Real Salt Lake from a struggling franchise into a selfless force that overwhelmed opponents. In the 2009 MLS Cup, Real Salt Lake went head to head with Beckham and the Galaxy and beat them soundly. What could have possibly resulted in the embarrassment of the great Beckham? Kreis. And he did it by connecting more.  (""Real Salt Lake's Kreis Deserves Coach of the Year for Team-First Mantra, Gordon Monson, Salt Lake Tribune, 11/6/11)  Today, don't focus as much on knowing.

Ted Cruz, and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee _ headline a conference Saturday in New Hampshire, hosted by the conservative groups Citizens United and Americans for Prosperity. (AP Photo/Jim Cole)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ce1e210000d601c96243.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Christopher Hitchens got a chance to analyze the Tea Party in 2011, the same year cancer took his life. In a Vanity Fair article titled ""Tea'd Off,"" the great polemicist explains that populist movements like the Tea Party are a reaction to social and political change. Hitchens writes that before the Revolutionary War costumes, America had seen a somewhat similar phenomenon with the John Birch Society: The John Birch Society possessed such a mainstream message--the existence of a Communist world system with tentacles in the United States--that it had a potent influence over whole sections of the Republican Party. It managed this even after its leader and founder, Robert Welch, had denounced President Dwight D. Eisenhower as a ""dedicated, conscious agent"" of that same Communist apparatus. Right up to the defeat of Barry Goldwater in 1964, and despite the efforts of such conservatives as William F. Buckley Jr. to dislodge them, the Birchers were a feature of conservative politics well beyond the crackpot fringe...Would staunch conservatives in this day and age ever accuse Eisenhower of being Communist? Probably not, but the rhetoric from Tea Party politicians bemoaning everything from Obamacare to gay marriage indicates that America is moving more to the left than to the right. While William F. Buckley Jr. was prescient enough to know that the John Birch Society wasn't good for Republicans, Eric Cantor found out too late (with the Tea Party he helped create) to keep his seat in Congress. The Tea Party miraculously began its existence when Barrack Obama was elected president, but remained oddly quiet when George Bush started the bank bailouts and racked up his own debt prior to the Wall Street collapse. Since then, its rhetoric has been polarizing and meant to speak primarily to a staunchly conservative base. The more people like Sen. Marco Rubio say, ""I do not believe human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate"" (contradicting 97 percent of climate scientists), Americans who care about science question their motives. The more politicians like Michele Bachmann evoke the Republican in Heaven by claiming, ""I believe God is going to answer our prayers and we'll be freed from the yoke of Obamacare,"" Americans who don't have knowledge of God's political views simply roll their eyes. As for Obamacare, the good Lord didn't listen to Michele Bachmann's prayers and the Supreme Court upheld the health care law as constitutional. A 2012 New York Times article explained how the ruling legitimized the most controversial law of the Obama administration:The Supreme Court on Thursday upheld President Obama's health care overhaul law, saying its requirement that most Americans obtain insurance or pay a penalty was authorized by Congress's power to levy taxes. The vote was 5 to 4, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. joining the court's four more liberal members...Despite all the effort put forth by the Tea Party, including trying 40 times to repeal the law, the Affordable Care Act remains the law of the land-socialist or not.In addition, Ted Cruz can make statements like, ""Judicial activism is judges imposing their policy preferences on the words of the Constitution"" and the Supreme Court (and lower courts) can completely disregard his analysis. In America, politicians pretend to speak for the founders and interpret the Constitution based on the beliefs of their constituents. A New York Times article in 2013 explained that two landmark Supreme Court rulings have paved the way for an eventual federal case that could make gay marriage legal in the U.S.: In a pair of major victories for the gay rights movement, the Supreme Court on Wednesday ruled that married same-sex couples were entitled to federal benefits and, by declining to decide a case from California, effectively allowed same-sex marriages there...Ted Cruz can claim ""marriage is under assault"" and whatever else he wants to express about gay marriage. Gov. Rick Perry is also free to express his knowledge of genetics by saying, ""I may have the genetic coding that I'm inclined to be an alcoholic, but I have the desire not to do that, and I look at the homosexual issue the same way."" What counts in this country is what the Supreme Court says and from recent rulings, this country is becoming more liberal.  As for how Americans feel about gay marriage, the Pew Research Center confirms that the majority of citizens don't share the Tea Party viewpoint. According to the Pew Research Center, more Americans now support same-sex marriage than ever before:In Pew Research polling in 2001, Americans opposed same-sex marriage by a 57% to 35% margin. Since then, support for same-sex marriage has steadily grown. Today, a majority of Americans (54%) support same-sex marriage, compared with 39% who oppose it.Finally, the Tea Party has become a wing of the GOP that Republicans never envisioned in 2008. Perhaps nothing illustrates this dilemma better than the words of Chris McDaniel after losing the Mississippi Senate race to Thad Cochran:""So much for bold colors,"" McDaniel said. ""So much for principle. I guess they can take some consolation in the fact that they did something tonight by once again compromising, by once again reaching across the aisle, by once again abandoning the conservative movement. I would like to know which part of that strategy today our Republican friends endorse. I would like to know which part of that strategy today our statewide officials endorse. This is not the party of Reagan, but we're not done fighting and when we're done it will be.""When ""reaching across the aisle"" is a bad thing, you know a political party has become extreme in its views. Chris McDaniel's belief that voters ""abandoned the conservative movement"" simply because they voted for another conservative illustrates the Pandora's Box opened by Republicans as a result of President Obama's first election victory. When 73 percent of Americans today believe that illegal immigrants should be able to legally stay in the U.S. and 8 million people have signed up for Obamacare, all the loud pontificating by Ted Cruz and other ""real"" conservatives can't deny one simple fact. The angrier and more vocal the Tea Party gets, the more we know that issues like gay marriage and Obamacare are becoming not only mainstream, but protected under the Constitution. Even if they break away from the GOP and form their own party (which would help liberals immensely), the Tea Party won't be able to stop the country from becoming more liberal with every generation."
22,POLITICS,Surveillance: It's Worse Than You Think,"Tom Engelhardt, ContributorEditor, TomDispatch.com",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/surveillance-worse-than-you-think_b_5533215.html,"Sooner or later -- count on it -- the company or business you work for will be capable, via intelligent software, of monitoring every move you make, not to speak of everyone you may be in touch with while on the clock.",2014-06-26,"Surveillance cameras in airport, blue toned image, adobe rgb 1998 use.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ce202400005000577061.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When it comes to spying, surveillance, and privacy, a simple rule applies to our world: However bad you think it is, it's worse. Thanks to Edward Snowden, we've learned an enormous amount about the global surveillance regime that one of America's 17 intelligence outfits has created to suck into its maw (and its storage facilities) all communications on the planet, no matter their form. We certainly know a lot more than we did a year ago about what the government is capable of knowing about us. We've also recently learned a good deal about ""big data"" and what corporations can now know about us, as well as how much more they may know once your house is filled with ""smart"" technology.Less is understood about how corporate surveillance is coming to the workplace, but sooner or later -- count on it -- the company or business you work for will be capable, via intelligent software, of monitoring every move you make, not to speak of everyone you may be in touch with while on the clock. The truth is, whatever the euphemisms, just about every imaginable way of knowing and surveilling you is here or on its way. In Oakland, California, for instance, you could mistake the anodyne name of ""the Domain Awareness Center"" for the latest in New Age spiritualism. In fact, as CNN recently reported, it's a ""proposed central surveillance facility where authorities can monitor the Port of Oakland and the city's airport to protect against potential terrorism."" Someday, it may integrate ""live, 24/7 data streams from closed circuit traffic cameras, police license plate readers, gunshot detectors, and other sources from all over the entire city of Oakland."" This means that, despite theoretically being on the lookout for terrorists (how many of those are there in Oakland?), it will be able to track you anywhere in the area.It's no exaggeration to say that in our developing brave new world of surveillance, inside or outside your house, there will be nowhere that you aren't potentially trackable and surveillable, no space that is just yours and no one else's. This also means that, however bad you think it is, government and corporate employees somewhere are already creating the next set of processes, technologies, and facilities to monitor you in yet more vivid detail.Now, let's add rule two: However bad you think it is, you don't know the half of it. Yes, you've been following the Snowden NSA revelations, but no Snowden has stepped forward (yet) to reveal what the CIA or FBI or Defense Intelligence Agency or Department of Homeland Security or National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency is doing. And as far as the national security state is concerned, the less you know, the better. Take, for example, a recent Associated Press story with this revelation: citing ""security reasons"" (as always), the Obama administration ""has been quietly advising local police not to disclose details about surveillance technology they are using to sweep up basic cellphone data from entire neighborhoods.""It might even be your neighborhood. In such a situation, it will be easy enough perhaps to forget the value of the sense of privacy in your life, whether you feel you have something to hide or not. Just yesterday, the Supreme Court put a rare brake on the loss of privacy, ruling that the police must have a warrant to search your cell phone after your arrest. In the second of a three-part series on the shredding of the Bill of Rights (amendment by amendment), State Department whistleblower takes on the destruction of the protections for American privacy in the Fourth Amendment -- destruction that, if we're not careful, could soon seem as American as apple pie.

The American Enterprise Institute and the Federalist Society held a book discussion with Justice Scalia, who co-authored the book 'Reading Law: The Interpretation of Legal Texts.' (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ce3325000094003a51bf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Thursday's Supreme Court ruling in McCullen vs. Coakley, despite the unified outcome and facade, makes it clear that abortion is and will continue to be a wedge issue dividing the justices for years to come.At first blush, that fracture is masked by what appears to be unanimity in favor of the First Amendment and free expression. After all, in striking down a Massachusetts law imposing a 35-foot buffer zone outside of medical facilities that perform abortions, all nine justices were united in the outcome. Not a single one disagreed with the result that the law was unconstitutional.McCullen thus appears to cut across the political lines that often split the justices neatly into blocks of four conservatives and four liberals, with Justice Anthony Kennedy typically providing the pivotal swing vote. Adding to this mirage of harmony in McCullen is the fact that Chief Justice John Roberts, nominated by former President George W. Bush, wrote the opinion of the court. He was joined by the Court's typically liberal members -- Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan -- who were nominated by Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.   The other justices, including Kennedy and a typically conservative trio of justices -- Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito -- also agreed with the result reached by the Roberts' majority.But that is where the mental image of the justices joining hands in bipartisan fashion around the high court campfire and singing a collective Kumbaya quickly comes to a close.It is in the concurring opinions -- a typically biting one authored by Justice Scalia and joined by Justices Kennedy and Thomas, and a much briefer solo one penned by Justice Alito -- where the illusion of accord is shattered.Although Roberts and his sometimes band of liberal friends -- he also was controversially joined by them back in 2012 in upholding the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius -- deemed the Massachusetts law content neutral, Scalia called it a content-based law. Alito went even further to call it viewpoint based, a worse subset of a content-based law.What's the difference between content-neutral and content-based laws and why does any distinction matter if the result is the same?It matters enormously because if a law is classified as content-neutral, it is subjected to a much lighter and more deferential form of scrutiny by the court than if it is categorized as content-based. In turn, content-neutral laws are more likely to be upheld.Roberts and the majority, in applying this form of relaxed review for content-neutral laws, found that the Massachusetts buffer-zone statute might have been okay if it had just been tightened up a little and refined a tad. In legal terms, the Massachusetts law simply was not narrowly tailored. As Roberts wrote, Massachusetts ""has available to it a variety of approaches that appear capable of serving its interests."" The Bay State only needs to go back to the drawing board and find some other means.Justice Scalia lambasted the notion that the Massachusetts law was content neutral, asserting:It blinks reality to say, as the majority does, that a blanket prohibition on the use of streets and sidewalks where speech on only one politically controversial topic is likely to occur - and where that speech can most effectively be communicated - is not content based. Would the Court exempt from strict scrutiny a law banning access to the streets and sidewalks surrounding the site of the Republican National Convention? Or those used annually to commemorate the 1965 Selma-to-Montgomery civil rights marches? Or those outside the Internal Revenue Service? Surely not.For Scalia, the majority's conclusion that the law is content-neutral makes it just that much easier to declare valid other laws across the country that ostensibly target the speech of anti-abortion individuals. Roberts' opinion, Scalia asserts, ""carries forward this Court's practice of giving abortion-rights advocates a pass when it comes to suppressing the free-speech rights of their opponents."" As Scalia writes:the majority can preserve the ability of jurisdictions across the country to restrict anti-abortion speech without fear of rigorous constitutional review. With a dart here and a pleat there, such regulations are sure to satisfy the tailoring standards applied in . . . the majority's opinion.Scalia even attempts to lessen the impact of the majority's conclusion that the law is content neutral by asserting that the majority's discussion of that issue was simply ""dicta"" -- matter extraneous to the real issues before the court, a sort of judicial jag irrelevant to reach the decision in the case.The bottom line is that despite agreement among all nine justices on the result in McCullen, abortion drives a deep wedge into the heart of the Supreme Court, even when the issue is not overruling Roe v. Wade but a First Amendment controversy. The future of Roe remains in jeopardy."
