According to a new survey by J.D. Power & Associates, the ""cheap seats"" may actually be the best in the airline industry.The company's ""2013 North American Airline Satisfaction Study,"" released earlier this week, ranks each of North America's top airlines on a scale from 1 to 1,000, relying on performance metrics in seven categories. In order of importance, those categories are: cost and fees; in-flight services; boarding, deplaning and baggage; flight crew; aircraft; check-in; reservation. The findings are based on 11,800 responses from passengers who flew on a North American carrier between April 2012 and March 2013.With a score of 717, Alaska Airlines took the top ranking in the ""traditional airline"" category. According to CNN, this is the sixth consecutive time Alaska Airlines has taken top honors, a distinction the company's president and CEO, Brad Tilden, said reflected ""the 13,000 Alaska Airlines and Horizon Air employees who show their dedication to customers every day and on every flight.""Delta came in second in the ""traditional airline"" category with a score of 682, while Air Canada's 671 points earned the company a third-place finish.Surprisingly, competitors at the ""low-cost"" level roundly bested their brethren in the ""traditional"" group. The top three low-cost carriers -- JetBlue (787), Southwest (770) and WestJet (714) -- all posted scores higher than Alaska Airlines.Reached for comment by The Huffington Post, study director Jessica McGregor said a direct comparison between the two categories would be accurate, as the survey used ""the same measures of satisfaction/scale"" for both segments.Interestingly, the study found travelers are beginning to accept extra charges for checked bags and booking changes, though such charges continue to have a negative effect on customer satisfaction overall.""Charging for bags still has a pronounced negative impact on passenger satisfaction,"" Ramez Faza, senior manager of travel practice at J.D. Power & Associates, said in a statement. ""But with each year, passengers are increasingly more accepting of carriers unbundling baggage and other fees.""Ultimately, it may all come down to service with a smile. The survey found airlines with employees who are more likely to smile -- even if it only happens some of the time -- had an average score 105 points higher than competitors. Airlines with employees that smiled more consistently saw an even higher boost of 211 points.Explained Faza, ""With the increasing use of technology reducing some personal interactions in the reservations and check-in processes, making the most of the rest of the passenger interaction with airline staff is imperative."""

Between the rips, sheerness and black bra, it's almost as if she's begging for a wardrobe malfunction (or an entirely new wardrobe).

5,TRAVEL,"Iceland's Northern Lights, Demystified","Cynthia Ord, Contributor
Writer, The Travel Word",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/icelands-northern-lights_us_5b9d28fbe4b03a1dcc850483,"Iceland is one of the world's most accessible spots for viewing the northern lights, making it one of the country's top tourist attractions. So what is the best way to go about seeing the phenomenon?",2013-05-15,2013-05-14-northernlightsglacierwalkinginiceland.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-05-14-northernlightsglacierwalkinginiceland.jpg,"Sublime. Celestial. Surreal. Since this is the kind of language used to describe the northern lights, I wanted to keep some sense of wonder intact while hunting the heavens for it in Iceland. At the same time, I knew that a bit of planning and research would be needed in order to maximize my chances of seeing that rare green glow. Iceland is one of the world's most accessible spots for viewing the northern lights, making it one of the country's top tourist attractions. Capitalizing on its mystique, enterprising Icelanders have designed borealis-oriented cruises, overland tours, and even a concept bar at far-flung Ion Hotel. So what is the best way to go about seeing the phenomenon?Here are a few things I learned while reading up on the northern lights in Iceland, seeking it out on my own, booking a tour to see it, and finally catching a glimpse.Gusts of solar windFor ages, humans stared up at the northern lights with little more than myth and superstition to explain it to themselves. Icelandic folklore has it that if a pregnant woman gazes at the northern lights, her child will be born cross-eyed. Ancient Nords and native Inuits both took the lights as a frightful omen. Now we know that the phenomenon isn't a precursor to calamity and that there's no need to shield your eyes or hide your kids.Aurora borealis, as it known scientifically, occurs when solar wind (gusts of charged particles that the sun releases) collides with the magnetic forces of the earth's atmosphere. Its southern counterpart is aurora australis. Both occur at extreme latitudes close to the earth's magnetic poles. Solar wind essentially illuminates wavy magnetic fields in the sky, which is where the rippling ribbon shape comes from. The most common color of light is green, but other colors can occur depending on the kind of particle and the altitude of the collision. The higher up, the more rare the color. Blood-red auroras happen at heights of up to 200 miles from the earth.A 10-year peak in 2013Winter is the best time for viewing the northern lights, since darkness is a must. August through mid-April of 2012-2013 has been an especially good season for viewing. This is because we're coming close to an 11-year peak in sunspot activity, which means lots of solar wind. It's not too late -- the peak isn't over. Another two or three fantastic winters are anticipated.Aurora-gazers have the best chances around the spring and fall equinox, so anytime around September 22, 2013 and March 20, 2014 are looking good, or anytime in between.Chase them on your own, or book a tourI spent four nights in Iceland; four chances to see the northern lights. The first night, I booked a stay in the small town of Hveragerdi, about a 45-minute drive from the light pollution of Reykjavik. When conditions align, the outdoor thermal hot tubs of Frost and Fire Guesthouse are an ideal viewing spot. Alas, my one night there was full-mooned and overcast. No green dazzle.One night down, three nights left. Noticing northern lights tours advertised in all the tour offices in Reykjavik, I was skeptical. Can something as elusive and capricious as the northern lights really be canned and commoditized?Hedging my bet on the celestial spectacle with an outdoor adventure beforehand, I opted for a tour that combined both glacier walking and northern lights viewing. The day was well-planned: spend a few hours romping around in crampons on SÃ³lheimajÃ¶kull glacier, then pass the time waiting for darkness to fall with an Icelandic dinner and visit to the volcano museum. The last stop before the lights chase began was Seljalandsfoss waterfall, imposing and floodlit in the dusk. Even if the tour had ended there, it would have been worthwhile.Forecasted, but not guaranteedNight was falling. Just before the aurora hunt began, our guide Stefan searched the most updated forecasts online. To forecast the northern lights, he explained, five criteria are taken into account: 1) It has to be nighttime 2) The sky has to be clear or at least partly clear of clouds 3) There has to be an eruption on the sun that releases solar wind 4) The solar wind has to be directed toward the Earth 5) The particles from the eruption must reach the Earth's magnetic fieldThat night, we had four out of five criteria on our side. Working against us: cloud coverage. We piled out of the bus for our first viewing attempt, bracing ourselves against the cold wind outside. I stared at the clouds forcefully, trying to will them apart with my gaze. Nothing. Back in the van, back out again for another attempt, strike two. A sense of defeat was sinking in.  Hard to photographIn Iceland, images of the northern lights had greeted me at every turn. On an airport billboard glowed dreamy swirls of luminous green against a black licorice sky. Maps and city guides, websites and brochures -- anything printed in English, it seemed -- was set against a background of wavy neon light in the sky. The marketing material had me thinking that all I'd have to do was look up, camera in hand, point, and shoot.At dinner before the lights hunt began, our guide Stefan offered some photography help. To really capture the effect, he said, you'll need a camera with manual settings, and probably a tripod. Experience with long-exposure shooting is a plus. I had already decided that photos were out of the question. if I was going to see the northern lights, it was going to be through my corneas, not on a camera screen.After two failed viewing attempts, the tour bus bounded back toward Reykjavik. I was dozing off in disappointment when the bus suddenly veered to the side of the road and lurched to a halt. A hole in the clouds! We spilled out of the bus and stared at that small patch of sky, imploring. Slowly, faint streaks of green made an apparition. We cheered them on, and another wave appeared above them, less shy this time. Three seconds, and the show was over. A curtain of clouds closed in. More applause.Of the 12 passengers on the tour, only one had set up a camera with a tripod. We huddled around to see how his image had turned out. It wouldn't make the cut for a travel brochure, but it was proof -- we had seen the northern lights, briefly."
6,FOOD & DRINK,Cooking Off the Cuff: Are They Beets Yet?,"Edward Schneider, Contributor
Travel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-are-they-beets-yet_us_5b9d2960e4b03a1dcc85091d,I'm always a little surprised when I see people discarding the greens from the beets they buy at the market.,2013-05-15,At New York's Union Square Greenmarket: Beet Greens With Incipient Roots,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d295f1f000050002180a5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"I'm always a little surprised when I see people discarding the greens from the beets they buy at the market. I'm sure they make good compost, but they make better eating; they taste very much like Swiss chard, which is no surprise considering how closely related the two plants are. So, on a recent visit to New York's Union Square farmers' market I smiled when I reached the Migliorelli Farm stand and saw big bunches of early-season beet greens with the tiny roots still attached. In a couple of weeks, these would be recognizable beets, but for the moment they were sub-bite-sized nodules sprouting luxuriant red-veined foliage. I imagine they'd been picked with the purpose of thinning the rows, but that took nothing away from their potential as dinner.So I bought a big bunch, washed them thoroughly (it took four vigorous rinses to get rid of the grit captured by the stems down at the root end) and with Jackie's help plucked off the wispy root strand at the end of each plant. We did not separate the leaves from the minuscule roots or cut them up in any way: they were young and would be tender when cooked.The way forward was pretty clear: I simply crammed them into a pan with some olive oil in which I'd previously sweated some finely chopped ginger, covered the pan over medium-low heat and turned the beets with tongs until they were wilted and tender but not mushy, removing the lid when they were nearly done. Why ginger? Why no onion and/or garlic? On the latter question, it was because I'd never before used beets at this pre-beet stage and wanted to leave the flavor as clear as possible. As to the ginger, it seemed to me that this would offer a boost without too much complication. (Plus, truth to tell, I've been on a ginger binge recently; as I write this, a pot of sauerkraut is simmering, and in addition to the usual aromatics it contains a couple of slices of ginger. These little fads often lead to good discoveries.) Once they were done, I checked for salt and let them cool: they are best served tepid -- and with a squeeze of lemon juice. (And yes, of course you can do this with normal beet greens.)What would we serve them with? It somehow wasn't a day for meat or fish, though the beets would have been good with either. One idea was simply to grill some bread, brush it with olive oil and have a dinner of beet-plant bruschetta. But while in this Italianate frame of mind I remembered half a basket of excellent sheep-milk ricotta from Dancing Ewe Farm, and this got me thinking of pancakes (even though this kind of fluffy, well-drained ricotta is best eaten plain, perhaps with honey and toasted walnuts). There was also a bunch of farmers-market scallions that would make these especially delicious. I made the batter by creaming the ricotta (300 grams -- a bit more than 10 ounces) in the food processor then transferring it to a bowl. I beat in three egg yolks: the whites of the scallions well sweated in butter -- almost starting to caramelize; three tablespoons grated pecorino (to maintain the sheep theme, though in retrospect I'd have been better off without its assertive flavor and its distracting texture); the grated zest of a medium lemon; about 2/3 cup of chopped raw scallion greens; and salt and pepper. Chopped sage leaves would have been a good addition too. I then beat the three egg whites until they formed soft peaks and folded them in. I cooked them fairly slowly in neutral oil with some butter for flavor. (Such pancakes are best eaten fresh out of the skillet: the egg whites collapse quickly, and the texture changes.)  These pancakes were a fine accompaniment to the not-quite-beets and their greens -- or was it the other way around? For Jackie and me, the tangle of tender red and green vegetable was the star; others might have seen it as a side dish. Either way, I'm glad the farmer brought these to market."

French food makes you nervous. Even worse? French sauces. With French names. BÃ©chamel sauce -- just reading the name might make you want to skip this article. But don't. Take a deep breath, we're going to sort this out together. Here is a dirty little secret about BÃ©chamel sauce: it only has three ingredients! How hard can it be to make something with only three ingredients? This simple, basic sauce is one of the five mother sauces (if you can list all five, your chef friends will be impressed), and is probably the simplest and most versatile one.First, watch this CRAZY SIMPLE bÃ©chamel sauce video tutorial. Then, we'll talk about why bÃ©chamel is such a great tool to have in your roster of kitchen tricks.SO simple, right? Lots of recipes will tell you to gently warm your milk before you add it to the roux. You CAN, it will make your sauce creamier, but you don't HAVE to if you don't want to dirty another pot. We also rarely utilize the egg yolk trick, because usually when we make BÃ©chamel, it is only because we are about to add cheese to it. Which brings us to the reasons why not being afraid of BÃ©chamel will really improve your life: Cheese Sauce You add Parmesan and Gruyere to your BÃ©chamel and you've got a classic Mornay sauce. Add cheddar to it, instant cheese fries. Toss in some cooked pasta and the cheese of your choice, creamy stovetop mac and cheese. A quick BÃ©chamel is a perfect start to a Velveeta-free chile con queso. Cream of _______ Soups Cream of mushroom, cream of potato, spinach, celery, chicken -- once you've got BÃ©chamel under your belt, you'll never buy a can of condensed soup again. Homemade Casseroles Now, don't turn your noses up. We know that you guys, like us, probably secretly crave green bean casserole come Thanksgiving-time. There are definitely a few of you who love hotdish and cheesy rice and broccoli casseroles -- here is the thing, the more ingredients you make yourself, the better these things taste. And your homemade BÃ©chamel is going to make your homemade cream of whatever soup taste amazing, and everyone knows cream of whatever soup is the secret ingredient to a great casserole.Lasagna There are those who believe that the best lasagna is made not with ample ricotta and mozzarella, but with delicate layers of BÃ©chamel. Are they right? You'll never know until you start making BÃ©chamel. Want to read more from HuffPost Taste? Follow us on Twitter, Facebook, Pinterest and Tumblr. "

Not this girl. The plan was to lie on the beach in a sun-induced stupor, a day alone with my thoughts. But there it was on the wall, the poster pasted at eye-level, two-inch-high letters blaring ""Bullfight on Sunday."" A swirl of browns and oranges, the illustration -- a blurry over-painted photo -- depicted a man on horseback leaning so far out of his saddle toward an angry bull that a trampling seemed inevitable. Now, if the photo had been of an ordinary matador I might have blown it off. Gold-embroidered jacket, red cape, ballet slippers, sharp sword, ho hum. But a man on horseback, head-to-head with an angry bull? That got the juices flowing and with them, the adrenaline. It was the oh-so-familiar tug of war, the battle between fight and flight, between want-to and shouldn't. It was the way you feel when an ambulance suddenly flashes in and out of your rear view mirror and passes you, sirens screaming.Not me, you tell yourself, I'm not an ambulance chaser, a blood-sucking ghoul. This is immediately followed, by, ""What's the buzz? I've got to know!"" And so, when Sunday afternoon rolled around, there I was in the Plaza de Toros, one of a packed crowd of men and women, girls and boys excited but patiently waiting for the big moment. Then the trumpets blared, the crowd roared and the first bull tore into the arena, big head, curved pointed horns, shoulder muscles rippling, hooves tearing up the dirt as he circled the ring. Spotting three helpers -- capeadores -- stepping out from behind a guard fence to shake their capes and attract his attention, he lowered his head and charged full speed into the fence. Wham, bang, crunch! as 2,000 pounds of bad-tempered testosterone skewered the fence, horns raking the boards until one of them fell off.   Of course, he was enraged. For four years he'd had the run of the ranch, roaming grassy pastures, gorging on muscle-building meals, sparring with other young bulls and relishing the satisfaction of driving away the occasional horseback rider come to provoke him into an outburst and test his mettle. And now, entering the ring, was another annoying man on horseback! Meanwhile I, from my seat in the stands, was as surprised as the bull. For instead of a matador, the fighter entering the ring was the world-famous rejoneador, Pablo Hermosa de Mendoza, the man on the poster. An equestrian bullfighter and practitioner of the ancient tradition of bull-fighting on horseback, the charismatic Hermosa travels with a string of high-strung, trained Lusitano horses -- necks arched, coats shining, hooves polished, tails knotted, manes woven with ribbons. And once a year he comes to Mazatlan, where he's a guaranteed sell-out. Whether or not you condone bullfighting, you can't tear your eyes away as Hermosa circles the ring, his horse prancing sideways, nerves a-jangle. Then he gets down to business, teasing the bull until it charges, then wheeling away. Leaning and turning, he circles the ring then doubles back as the bull, its horns just inches away, tries to gore the horse. Whirling, spinning, leaping, taunting, Hermosa is a tour de force, wearing down the bull, impressing riders with his horsemanship and astonishing everyone else with the horses' acrobatic dexterity (they are every bit as impressive as the Lipizzaner stallions). Handsome, brave, daring, Hermosa molds the crowd into a single-brained cheering, gasping, groaning, clapping, handkerchief-waving, adoring mass.Four bulls entered the ring that afternoon, each more aggressive than the ones before it. Hermosa was matched with two; the matador, notable only for an especially mediocre performance, faced the other two. As expected, each bull met the expected fate, Hermosa's bulls dying quickly, the matador's more painfully. Was the bullfight cruel? Animal activists say it is. But is raising cattle for food any less cruel? Castrated as calves, typically at two months of age, steers raised for meat live one, maybe two years before they're fattened up on corn (a grain they can't digest) and butchered. Bullfight supporters make the case that a bull raised wild and free, even if destined for the bullring, lives better and longer. I'm heading to the BIG M again, for the next Mardi Gras celebration, touted as the world's third largest after Rio and New Orleans. Would I go to the bullfights again, when I'm there in Mazatlan? Maybe. But only if those magical horses -- and their owner-- are on the poster. After Spain, Mexico is the country with the greatest number of bullrings and fans, with bullfights held on Sundays from October through April. In Spain, where the region of Catalonia has banned the sport, the Spanish Parliament is currently considering whether to strike down the ban and is debating legislation to protect bullfighting as a national cultural heritage.
