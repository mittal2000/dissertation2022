0,TASTE,Cooking Off The Cuff: Using That Homemade Ricotta,"Edward Schneider, ContributorTravel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-usin_b_5540040.html,"Could I have done all these things with store-bought ricotta and, say, buttermilk? Yep. Would I? Not in the space of two weeks, that's for sure.",2014-07-02,"Tart, savory ricotta gnocchi with simple tomato sauce",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e2ac7240000320053ded3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Not long ago I wrote about making ricotta at home. I've made it several times since then, both as written and in a ""sweet"" version without the garlic and herbs, and Jackie and I have been eating lots of it, sometimes plain but mostly as an element of other dishes. I've also discovered a versatile ingredient in the whey -- tart with lemon juice and with a fine dairy flavor.Here are some of the ricotta things we've eaten. (All of them can, of course, be prepared with ricotta that someone else has made. If you use supermarket ricotta, leave it in a fine sieve, refrigerated, to drain for 24 hours; farmers' market ricotta is usually dry and fluffy enough to use as is, but keep your wits about you as you cook, and if the dish needs tinkering with, tinker away.)Our new Favorite Food in the Whole World is ricotta gnocchi, made with the savory version as described in the original post. The recipe works perfectly by weight, so I won't give volume measures. For two or three generous portions (four to six starter portions), use a wooden spoon or (better) a rubber spatula to beat an egg into 250 g ricotta, then add 125 g flour and 60 g grated parmesan, plus salt and pepper (taste the resulting mixture for seasoning). When kneaded for half a minute, this should yield a dough that's firm enough not to be sticky but that's easy to form into a ""rope""; adjust as needed with additional flour or spoonfuls of whey (or milk). Form a 5/8-inch (1.6-cm) rope, then cut it into gnocchi. Emulating our friend Zoe's boyfriend, I use a sort of Chinese roll-cut, cutting at a 45-degree angle, giving the rope a quarter turn, then cutting again. Here's a video demonstrating the cut -- though I turn the rope toward rather than away from me as I go. Use immediately or hold in the fridge on a waxed-paper-lined, well floured tray (or put the tray into the freezer until the gnocchi are hard, then transfer them to a plastic bag for storage). If not frozen, they take five minutes to cook in gently boiling salted water; use a skimmer to transfer them to the pan containing whatever sauce you're serving them with and toss to combine.We've eaten these gnocchi with a simple tomato sauce; with lots of freshly shelled peas (cooked with spring onions, chicken stock, mint and butter); and with mixed-herb butter with a few peas and strips of lettuce, topped with shredded ricotta salata (store-bought). Each one was the best thing we'd ever tasted. The gnocchi are tender but bouncy and are just so delicious: Move over, potatoes.The same herb/garlic-infused ricotta has found its way onto a pizza bianca, too -- much more interesting than bland ricotta; it would be excellent in calzone too, or of course in ravioli.From a little batch of ricotta made without the garlic and herbs, but with some grated lemon zest, I made an elegant dessert tart - a small one, about 6 inches (15 cm) across. I first completely baked the pastry shell (4 oz / 115 g flour; 2.5 oz / 70 g butter; a little simple syrup to hold it together; and salt), lined with aluminum foil and dried beans to keep it from bubbling up. The filling was a good cup (250 ml by volume) of ricotta vigorously beaten with 3 tablespoons (35 g) of sugar, a whole egg and an egg yolk, plus a few (very few) rum-soaked raisins. It took 15 minutes to set in a 350-degree F (175 C) oven and was served at room temperature.I've done a number of things with the whey, too. In the original post, I wrote about cooking spring garlic in whey, then pureeing it into a creamy, garlicky sauce. I've since made mashed potatoes in a similar way -- and have also cooked small dice of new potatoes in whey, then added them to that spring garlic puree: this aromatic, lemony-tart sauce/vegetable was terrific served with scallops.The whey has also ended up in two kinds of savory pancakes. One was made with stale bread soaked in whey and broken down in the food processor to a sort of pap, to which I added eggs, sweated shallots and slivered herbs before cooking in oil flavored with butter. Bread pancakes of any kind are a great thing, and the whey added a new dimension. The other was a grand way of using a scant cup of leftover basmati rice that had been cooked as a gently spiced pilaf: I warmed the rice in whey (this softened the grains, which were fridge-hard), pureed it with an immersion blender, then added more whey, an egg and lots of herbs. The aroma of the basmati rice was striking, and the tartness of the whey made perfect sense -- we eat yogurt with pilafs, don't we?Could I have done all these things with store-bought ricotta and, say, buttermilk? Yep. Would I? Not in the space of two weeks, that's for sure. And there's more to come, I'll bet."

Szostak of USA speaks during a joint news conference held by the Nobel Foundation at the Karolinska Institute on December 6, 2009, in Stockholm. The Nobel Prize ceremony will take place on December 10, 2009, in Stockholm.

Yes, he's a Nobel laureate, but the moment of silence seems to be more for a man who is trusted. He's also a handsome man, with fine Polish features. (His paternal grandfather was from Cracow.) The elegance he and his wife brought to the Nobel events, captured in photos, says more.Szostak's autobiography mentions that his father Bill, an aeronautical engineer, built a chemistry lab for him in the basement of their home in Montreal during his high-school years, encouraging and sometimes participating in the scientific exploration. Vi, his mother, supplied the ""remarkably dangerous chemicals"" from her job -- the mixing of which, he notes, ""frequently led to explosions.""Szostak graduated from high school at age 15 and entered McGill University that same year. He earned a B.S. in cell biology from McGill, and then a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Cornell University.I was first introduced to Jack Szostak's work in 2008 during a conversation with astrobiologist Bob Hazen, who liked what Szostak was doing with self-organization in synthetic biology. ISSOL (International Society for the Study of the Origin of Life) president Dave Deamer later steered me to Szostak's ""great molecular animations."" Jack Szostak is a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School, Alexander Rich Distinguished Investigator at Massachusetts General Hospital, an investigator at Howard Hughes Medical Institute< and a professor of chemistry and chemical biology at Harvard University. He also directs a lab at Harvard where he is researching the origin of life and synthesizing a protocell -- from scratch.Other big names in science, like Matthew Powner and Irene Chen, found a home early on in the Szostak lab as postdocs. Powner told me he was inspired by the ""free-thinking"" environment there.Szostak, along with Harvard astrophysicist Dimitar Sasselov, also coordinates a team of origins scientists funded by the Simons Foundation, among them Gerald Joyce, John Sutherland, and Matt Powner. Jack Szostak is the recipient of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences Award in Molecular Biology, the Hans Sigrist Prize, the Genetics Society of America Medal, the Lasker Award, the Dr. H.P. Heineken Prize, and the 2009 Nobel Prize, with Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, ""for the discovery of how chromosomes are protected by teleomeres and the enzyme telomerase.""He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the New York Academy of Sciences, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.Szostak is co-author, with Dave Deamer, of the book The Origins of Life and a large number of scientific papers. He is also the author of a much-discussed commentary, ""Attempts to Define Life Do Not Help to Understand the Origin of Life,"" in which he says:An inordinate amount of effort has been spent over the decades in futile attempts to define ""life"" -- often and indeed usually biased by the research focus of the person doing the defining.I first met Jack Szostak at the Simons Foundation this spring, and then again at the World Science Festival, where he announced he'd have ""life in the lab"" in three to five years. Our conversation follows.Suzan Mazur: What properties of life are you looking to synthesize in your protocell, and what are the outstanding issues in making the synthetic cell? Jack Szostak: What we're trying to build in the lab is a protocell, a simple cell that can grow and divide and, most importantly, start to evolve in the Darwinian sense. That requires several things. With a cell model you need to have a cell boundary, a cell membrane that can grow and divide. We already have that; we've published on that. The other thing that is really critical is to have some kind of genetic material that can replicate so that useful information can be inherited -- in other words, can propagate from cell to daughter cell.What we're thinking about mostly these days is that that genetic material might be RNA or some closely related material. One of the reasons we like RNA is that it acts even now as a genetic material. We also know that it can act as a catalyst. There are ribozymes, which are basically enzymes made of RNA.Suzan Mazur: What are you missing at this point?Jack Szostak: What we're missing is the ability to replicate RNA molecules without enzymes.Suzan Mazur: What is the distinction between ""self-reproduce"" and ""replicate""? Is there a distinction?Jack Szostak: Some people make a distinction between perfect replication and replication with errors. Any kind of replication always has errors. To me the distinction is pointless.Suzan Mazur: Is there another outstanding issue in making the protocell aside from getting it to replicate?Jack Szostak: That is the big issue, getting it to replicate. That problem has a number of sub-problems.Suzan Mazur: Norm Packard, whose company ProtoLife has worked on synthetic cells, recently told me this:Right now, the way we see RNA getting produced is with this enzyme that catalyzes the production of RNA. But how do you get that enzyme? Well, that enzyme is a thick, giant protein. So somehow you have to bridge this gap of getting RNA production to happen without this enzyme or create a story of how the enzyme gets created along the way. But so far this hasn't happened.You're exploring non-enzymatic RNA replication.Jack Szostak: That's right.Suzan Mazur: So this continues to be the sticking point.Jack Szostak: People have been trying to solve the problem of non-enzymatic replication for the last 50 to 60 years. The late Leslie Orgel and his colleagues and students, including Jerry Joyce, spent a lot of time on that problem. They made a lot of progress, but ultimately they got frustrated and concluded that it was impossible.Everybody started to look at alternatives, either alternatives to RNA or different modes of catalysis. For example, RNA catalyzed RNA replication, which we spent a lot of time on. Now we've come back to the idea of reassessing those problems. We know a little bit more.Suzan Mazur: But you've said you think you'll have ""life in the lab"" -- as Mario Livio put it -- in three to five years. So what kind of life do you think you'll have?Jack Szostak: I might have been feeling optimistic that day. I think we've solved most of the issues on the way to RNA replication. The big one that's remaining is how to bring chemical energy into the system. The problem is RNA falls apart. The activated nucleotides we use to do the non-enzymatic replication -- they react with water, so they fall apart. There needs to be a way to bring energy back into the system to essentially keep the battery charged, to keep all the nucleotides activated and to keep things running. If that problem can be solved, then I think we will be able to do non-enzymatic RNA replication.And because we've solved a lot of the other issues, that will allow us to generate a replicating protocell. Suzan Mazur: How collaborative an effort is this? Aside from your own team there at Harvard, are you looking to external labs like John Sutherland's?Jack Szostak: Sure.Suzan Mazur: For the mix that you're going to put into your lipid vesicles. Is that right?Jack Szostak: Yes, we definitely talk a lot to John and his lab in Cambridge, and to Matt Powner, who was a student of John's and a postdoc with me. We talk frequently with Jerry Joyce and Donna Blackmond at Scripps -- basically everyone who's active in the field and thinking creatively about these problems. We all talk to each other and hope we can together come up with a solution.Suzan Mazur: Are you referring to the Simons Collaboration on the Origins of Life?Jack Szostak: Those people I mentioned are part of the Simons Collaboration.Suzan Mazur: What Matt Powner told me a few weeks ago was that he and John Sutherland were able to come up with a ""robust and high-yielding synthesis for two of the four nucleotides, uridine and cytidine,"" and that they will ""get to the purines as well and maybe DNA.""Dimitar Sasselov, your co-coordinator at the Simons Collaboration, told me that synthesizing the protocell will require special ultraviolet light, which he's making.It sounds like there's a bit more work to do.Jack Szostak: The problem of the origin of life, if you stand back and look at the whole thing, is a whole pathway all the way from planet formation to the various chemical steps, like making nucleotides, to assembling a protocell, which is what we're working on, and then on to the evolution of the genetic code, etc. What I meant when I said ""three to five years"" was, given the building blocks, if we have the building blocks, we'll be able to generate an evolving protocell. There may still be gaps in our knowledge of how, prebiotically, to make nucleotides, or maybe gaps with what happens afterwards. We're just working on that little part of how you get the molecules to work together and act like a cell.Suzan Mazur: We may never know precisely the origin of life, but how much insight into the actual origin of life do you think a protocell like yours might give us, say, on a scale of 1 to 10?Jack Szostak: We've been working on one part of the problem. Other people are working on other parts of the pathway. I don't worry, at this point, whether we'll know exactly how it happened on the early Earth. What we're trying to do is to work out a plausible pathway where all of the steps seem chemically and physically reasonable, and maybe we'll end up with multiple pathways which are all possibilities.Suzan Mazur: Aren't there a half dozen or so labs working on some type of synthetic cell right now, all with different approaches?Jack Szostak: Most of the other people who are working on artificial [synthetic] cells are taking existing biological cells and trying to take them apart to reconstitute them from components, or they are trying to simplify them. Suzan Mazur: Minimal cells.Jack Szostak: Right.Suzan Mazur: What applications might result from a successful protocell synthesis?Jack Szostak: At the moment I can't see any practical applications. To me it's just intellectually interesting.Suzan Mazur: What are the potential dangers of unleashing ""Generation II,"" as Sasselov describes it? Could the cell have the robustness to interact with the environment outside the lab?Jack Szostak: The things that we're trying to make, even if we're successful, will be totally dependent on an environment that will only exist in our lab. There is no place on the modern Earth like the early Earth.Suzan Mazur: Do you think we need more public awareness about the origin of life and what the plan is regarding the synthetic cell? People are curious as to why you're doing this. Yes, it's a fantastic intellectual exercise, but there must be some sort of vague goal. Do you think the public should be better informed about it, maybe by way of a series of roundtables on the Charlie Rose show, underwritten by one of the sponsors of the World Science Festival, or Pfizer, perhaps, like the Paul Nurse 13-part series on Charlie Rose a few years ago? Jack Szostak: I think there's already been huge public interest. Almost everyone would like to know how we got here. With all the excitement of NASA and the exploration of our solar system and the detection of planets around other stars -- almost anybody who has any interest in the world we live in knows about that. I think that's already stimulated a lot of interest about the origin of life.We do try to do things like public lectures. Being on TV shows takes a certain talent. Not everybody has the television charisma of Paul Nurse.Suzan Mazur: When we met at the Simons Foundation in April, you told me that you ""don't believe"" in autocatalytic sets. Why is that? Haven't the Europeans integrated autocatalytic subsystems into their systems science?Jack Szostak: Autocatalytic sets is one of those concepts where the people who came up with the original idea, like Stuart Kauffman, rather than admit being wrong, kept changing their story until it was basically the same concept everybody was already working on.The original idea was that there would be large numbers of compounds where one would help another to replicate, and that one would help some other one to replicate, and that somehow, out of this huge population of interacting molecules, autocatalytic replication would emerge.In my opinion, that was never chemically realistic. Now you see people talking about non-enzymatic RNA replication and calling that ""autocatalytic sets."" If that's what you want to call it, that's fine. But it seems like the concept has lost all meaning.Suzan Mazur: I see. Thank you."

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7642b250000360039e380.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's the football (soccer) season again, and I find myself in a good mood. Growing up, I always looked forward to the Olympic Games and, during middle school, the World Cup. My reason was simple: I would have an excuse to watch more TV for some exciting stuff, not all of which I understood, but still, some exciting stuff which was better than no exciting stuff. Even better, I'd have something to discuss with my classmates the morning after -- anything from players' flops to commentators' gaffes. Everyone would join in, even the quiet kids who were often too shy to participate in a rowdy conversation that might involve the teachers. Bonding, so to speak. Even better, I might be allowed to stay up for a late-night game if my parents also happened to be interested in it. The night when the Barcelona Olympics opened, I as a preschooler could only steal a few glimpses from my bedroom. But in those few glimpses, I saw what seemed to me like such an extravaganza beyond worldly existence. For a kid who had barely left her block with two channels available on TV, moments like that were a big deal. Even just seeing the daylight in another country when it was pitch dark at home was enough for me to know that the world really was round, and there was a whole lot out there to be seen and lived one day. This is the feeling that I only got to revisit at the recent World Sports Values Summit for Peace and Development in New York City. The Summit's co-organizer, Professor Katherine Marshall, has already made a succinct statement of the Summit's multifaceted outcome, which is also captured by the Summit Declaration. Young people today, in particular, were recognized as using sports to address challenges in both conflict and post-conflict settings. But where does one find the ""significant potential"" of sports to ""overcome cultural divides, build community and advance peace and the common good,"" as the Declaration suggests? Clearly, ""sports"" could mean very different things for different people. To me, its meaning is not complete without invoking the middle-school bonding after World Cup matches and those glimpses through the bedroom door. To many of my friends here in the U.S., it often entails beer on a Sunday night. To some in Africa, it might mean making and playing with a football made from plastic bags. But this is exactly how sports unite by highlighting commonality among those who are otherwise very different. From the thousands who worked for the Beijing Olympics one would get thousands of different defining ""moments."" In my case such a moment came quite unexpectedly. It was just another morning in the summer of 2008, when my coworkers and I were waiting for the bus to the Olympic Village where we worked. As our bus wobbled to a halt, barely able to support itself from the overload, the bus conductor got off and started to use her bull strength to push the outflowing passengers onto the bus. As we were in the middle of the intensive shoving and pushing my coworker turned to me and said, half-jokingly: ""Even at a time like this?"" By ""a time like this"" she meant the Olympics. Sure, bus conductors in China had been doing this since the beginning of time (though not as professionally as those in Japan), but it still took a moment of being in the spotlight for one to be self-aware of such facts. Oftentimes, it's in moments like this that we're made to face our shortcomings and decide to finally do something about them. Such attempts may succeed, or they may fail miserably. But over the centuries, sports have provided all nations with many more opportunities to do so than otherwise. Since ancient times, people have put down fighting to do sports. When the reverse happens, it's often a sign that the world is undergoing turmoil of some sort. The absence of sports, in this regard, is much like a symptom of a malaise, an outward expression of something much deeper. These were among the brief thoughts I shared at the World Sports Values Summit, which was much like an assembly of proactive idealists. A proactive idealist knows that just because one can't do everything doesn't mean one has to sit there and do nothing, as Lord Michael Bates from one of the panel sessions pointed out. Through sports, many of us have got to know better and even make friends with those who were our enemies. It's up to us each to take that further and let sports help promote peace and foster development through the building of social capital. Just as trade and interdependence have many times played an important pacifying role from the Pax Romana through today, sports can and should continue to be a stabilizing force especially in regions that are undergoing increasing tension, and we are all responsible in ways great and small to make it a reality."

To his credit, before his death, Gwynn shared with the world the deadly consequences of using tobacco, but will we listen?   All tobacco products, even e-cigarettes, can be highly addictive. Many deniers choose to look at Gwynn's death as a freak circumstance and the ""it can't happen to me"" response is pervasive in our culture. Will such denial continue to overpower the facts? Smokeless tobacco contains almost 30 cancer-producing chemicals.As an oral health professional, I see the initial stages of oral, gum, throat and salivary gland cancers all too often. For the purposes of this conversation, I will focus solely on chewing tobacco. Just in the sports industry alone, two-thirds of major league players are addicted to smokeless tobacco. That's a staggering percentage of men as well as women -- putting their very lives at risk for the sake of a nicotine high.For both genders, cancer of the mouth and pharynx ranks sixth overall in the world.A recent study showed that tobacco chewers have a 2-3 fold increase in nickel compared to non-chewers. Large quantities of nickel consumption increase the chances of developing chronic bronchitis and lung and nasal cancers.In terms of etiology, the effects of tobacco use, heavy alcohol consumption, and poor diet combined account for over 90 percent of head and neck cancer cases. There are even studies that show that smokeless tobacco is more carcinogenic than smoked tobacco!Gwynn is not the first baseball legend to dip and die, but his is the most recent and his death should stick in our collective conscience for more than just a second. I find it appalling that the baseball union proposes continuing player education about tobacco cessation as opposed to a ban. So many young people, especially high school-age boys, are influenced by seeing their baseball heroes dipping that it's become as natural to them as another staple of baseball life: hot dogs.The rush from the nicotine isn't worth the risks of devastating consequences of lives cut way too short. It's a self-destructive habit that is known to lead to mouth, tongue, cheek, gum and throat cancers. As naive or Pollyanna as this may sound, I have to suggest another type of rush. Chocolate. The caffeine in a piece of 75 percent dark chocolate provides a natural increase in endorphins, and so it makes for a great alternative to the nasty and health destroying aspects of smokeless tobacco."

She had to deal with her grief as well as become the sole breadwinner and a single parent for her three kids. Seven years later, she's moved her food-selling business from a street cart into a restaurant of her own: Her specialty is a Peruvian delicacy: lamb's-head stew. Part 5 of our 5-part series from Peru.Eulalia and her employee-niece Gabi in front of their restaurant, Caldo's Café. Juliaca, Peru: If you travel to Peru and find yourself in the ""windy city"" of Juliaca, 12,549 feet above sea level in the Andes Mountains, you can stop by Caldo's Café for a local treat. Customers come from near and far to nibble on Eulalia's lamb's-head stew (caldo de cabeza), a traditional Andean delicacy that she still simmers fresh each morning. Cooking and serving, running the cash register and keeping inventory stocked, Eulalia Martinez Quispe runs her seven-table café from 6 a.m. till 9 p.m. At 44, she doesn't take this work for granted -- it's been a long road from selling food off a street cart to owning her own restaurant.""I am [both] the mother and the father of my children, so I need to work many hours,"" she lifts her hands open as she speaks. Two children, ages seven and seventeen, still live with her; her oldest son, 24, is married and has a daughter of his own.Eulalia (R) serves her speciality to one of her regulars. Bright sunlight fills the café as regulars hide behind newspapers or lean back in their chairs to watch the Peruvian soap opera on the television bracketed to the wall. It's lunchtime, and Caldo's fills every table. Eulalia and her employee, who also happens to be her niece, 24-year-old Gabi, sashay their way through narrow spaces in-between, delivering plates full of trout, potatoes, and that fragrant lamb. Gabi has nearly completed college at the technological institute in accounting. They've been a big help to one another, as Gabi's been able to earn money working here in the mornings while she attends classes in the afternoons. But when she graduates, she expects to jump from $25/week waiting tables to $100/week in her field.As for Eulalia, every promotion and raise she's received has been made, as a microentrepreneur, by her own two hands. Twenty years ago when she was a young mother of three, she cooked food at home and sold it on the street. Ten years ago, she joined a credit group to rent her own space. She uses her current loan to stock up on rice, dehydrated potatoes, and other ingredients. She's also been able to refinish the floor and add new tables and chairs to the café. Currently, she makes $75-100/day. She says, ""Some people are afraid of risk, but I'm not. [Each cycle] I ask for a bigger loan, but it's a calculated risk.""Usually, Eulalia closes the café for a few hours during siesta to purchase inventory and maybe take a bit of a rest herself, before returning to serve api, a hot beverage made of corn flour, to passersby heading home from work in the evening hours. However, once a month she posts the ""Cerrado"" sign and walks across town to meet with the 34 members of her ""Amauta"" (""Leader"") credit group. It's a family affair, as her 20-year-old daughter-in-law, Juliana -- also a member of the group -- joins her and between the two of them, they hold grand-baby Karla, age one-and-a-half, on their laps.""I've already lived through the hardest part"" of life, Eulalia shakes her head, ""when my husband died. He was fat, and he had a heart attack. He died seven years ago, at age 34."" Now she has access to private health insurance through her credit group, and she gladly invests $40/month - -which covers the entire family. ""Every month, I go for a checkup,"" she tells her friends, because she doesn't want to take any chances with her own health.Since becoming both a widow and single mother in one moment -- choices she never would have made -- Eulalia has felt the strain of worrying about her children and working many long hours. She says she would never have endured these years without the support of her group.""We like to be together,"" Eulalia comments. ""The field officer comes and makes us sing and dance. We are all really close in this group."" Each monthly meeting includes a class. This month, it's women's empowerment; next, they'll study ""My Health First"" and ""Increase Your Business.""""We come here to de-stress ourselves, because it's really fun,"" Eulalia says. As you can see, the field agent makes us dance and sing. We've also learned to be on time, be responsible, be kind to our clients.""Eulalia with 24-year-old niece Gabi, who's also her #1 employee.Tonight, they'll celebrate three members' birthdays that fall within the month. It's Eulalia's job to coordinate these fiestas de cumpleaños, and she hasn't forgotten to bring a large marble cake and liter bottles of soda, plenty to go around the room. The volume in the group president's living room rises as the women chatter and laugh, and sleepy Karla begins to fuss. Eulalia and Juliana step outside with little Karla. A cool breeze lifts their hair, and they breathe out as they step across the street into a small city park where Karla can toddle freely. Behind the roof of the small adobe home they've just left, the equatorial sun vanishes, leaving just a streak of purple in its wake.""My dream is to rent a larger restaurant, but lots of people work for me instead of me having to do everything!"" Eulalia laughs. Then her face darkens, just for a moment, as she thinks back to the circumstances that got her here.""I want always to be with my children,"" she says to Juliana, ""and for them to work hard and be professionals. I always teach my kids not to take life for granted, because I could die at any moment. They have to work hard.""Eulalia believes that their city is a place of opportunity, where anyone who works hard can get ahead. ""Here in Juliaca, you could sell stones if you wanted to,"" she jokes, but she is not really joking. Residents do sell stones from nearby Lake Titicaca to tourists: lake rocks that supposedly bring blessings and money. Eulalia thinks it's a grand sales scheme... but she's bought a few lake rocks herself, just for luck.Learn more about Freedom from Hunger's approach to ending poverty and injustice in Peru through access to education, healthcare, and enterprise here.Photographs by Jim Cline for Freedom from Hunger and Suzanne Skees."
