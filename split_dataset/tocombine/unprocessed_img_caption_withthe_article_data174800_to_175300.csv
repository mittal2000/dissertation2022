Phil lifts up your mood with his upbeat attitude and makes you feel good all day! Carol, on the other hand, makes you feel like running for the emergency exit!Each and every one of us brings energy to our co-workers, loved ones, and even the stranger in line behind us at the grocery store. It would serve us all well to realize that the energy we radiate affects others' lives, and we need to be responsible for it. The following are ways to recognize what we're ""putting out there,"" how to deal with people who don't, and why it's so important:1) Vibrate ResponsiblyAsk yourself this question: ""Are you taking responsibility for the energy you're bringing to others?"" If you've had a tough day, does everybody hear about it from you? Does everyone know how rotten and unfair you think your life is? Do you have ""pity parties"" for yourself on a regular basis? (You know who you are.) When you come home from work, school, or wherever, does your family immediately sense whether you've had a good day or a bad one? (Believe me, they do... They can feel your energy.)We live on a vibrational planet, and everything on the planet vibrates, including people. We either put out a high vibration or a low vibration. A high vibration results from feelings of happiness, love, respect, and so forth. A low vibration comes from the emotions of anger, depression, stress, and so on. When you come home to your family or go to work each day, recognize how your vibration affects and influences the degree of joy or sadness in other people's lives. Step back and check yourself: What type of energy are you carrying from place to place, person to person? Is it going to enhance another's well-being or deteriorate it?If you radiate a positive, high vibration, and someone comes into contact with you who is radiating a rather negative, low vibration, you have a choice. The choice is either to 1) maintain your alignment with that positive vibration by politely excusing yourself from them or staying and deciding not to attach to their petty dramas, or 2) lower yourself to the other person's negative vibration, letting their drama change your mood for the worse. For those times when you encounter particular individuals who, without fail, ""push your buttons,"" no matter how hard you try to remain centered, remember that when you start getting all worked up, those people are your ""Peace Teachers."" They are teaching you how to find peace. They are testing you! You can ""pass the test"" by learning to be peaceful as an alternative to anger or frustration -- accepting that they are who they are, and it is what it is -- to keep you on the right track.2) Join the Club!Have you ever noticed how certain people gravitate toward each other? In school, we called them ""cliques."" For instance, if you look closely enough, you'll tend to see that people who are always complaining about something seem to be friends with other complainers. Those who are rather judgmental usually hang out with people who also hold critical views. And consequently, folks who like to laugh and just have fun normally get together with others who have similar interests and share their sense of humor. To put it another way, animal rights organizations don't attract members that enjoy hunting, and hunting clubs don't attract vegetarians. However, angry people do attract other angry people, and happy people do attract other happy people. Individuals who are on the same vibrational level are magnets to one another. Therefore, be the type of person you would like to attract to yourself. Be the kind of person you'd like to have as a friend. Take a moment and look around you... What ""clubs"" have you joined?3) The Ripple EffectLet's look at ""the big picture."" When we contribute to a shift in another person's energy, either positively or negatively, it actually affects humanity on a much larger scale. It's like throwing a rock into a lake and watching the ripples of water multiply and get bigger, traveling further and further out until they spread so far and wide that the ripples eventually become one with the body of water as a whole. When you ""throw out"" that one smile or helping hand to someone who needs it, you spark a ""ripple effect."" Creating change in a person's energy toward the positive raises their vibration. In turn, they will then affect whomever they come into contact with, and on and on and on...Conversely, that one rude comment or little ""meltdown"" can spark the ripple effect in a very negative way... Who knows just how many people could end up shifting into a lower vibration because of something you said or did without even thinking about the consequences?Everything we say and do does matter. We have a lot more power than most of us realize.So let's choose to be more self-aware and really stop and think about our words, our actions, and our attitudes before we combine our energies with the energies of others. Are we communicating things that are really meaningful and necessary? Do our words and behaviors build people up or tear them down? Let's be thoughtful and considerate of the lives of those around us and bring the positive energy to each other that we all truly deserve.For more by Donna Labermeier, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."

Some 203 people have been sickened with meningitis in 14 states and the numbers continue to mount.The illness is believed to be linked to fungus contamination in some of the steroid shipped from NECC used mostly for epidural injections to control back pain.Since the beginning of the month, some 330 patient have gone to the St. Thomas 29-bed emergency room, where the triage area is named after the mother of comedian, actress and star of ""Laugh In"" Lily Tomlin, whose family is from Nashville and donated privately to the facility.But it is no laughing matter of late, as two people have died of meningitis at St. Thomas and the hospital has treated 33 of the 53 cases of meningitis in Tennessee, the hardest hit state.While the hospital has not given patient names, one of the casualties at St. Thomas was Reba Temple, 80, of Centerville, Tennessee, according to a family friend. Temple herself was a former health director of Hickman County.More than 275 patients have undergone spinal tap tests at the hospital, a painful procedure to determine if they have meningitis.""That has to be some type of entry for the Guinness Book of World Records, an entry I wish we could have avoided,"" Dr. Robert Latham, chief of medicine and director of the Infectious Diseases Program at the hospital, said on Friday.At one point 40 to 45 patients who had received injections were being treated at St. Thomas each day, officials said.Of those who have survived so far, two remain in critical condition, 28 are in stable condition and on Friday the hospital sent the first of its victims home, where the patient will continue intravenous anti-fungal therapy.""Our first case (of fungal meningitis) has been in the hospital for over four weeks on continuous anti-fungal therapy,"" Latham said. CLINIC GOT MORE VIALS THAN OTHER FACILITIESOf the 17,676 vials of steroid suspected of being contaminated, 2,000 vials went to the ninth floor of the Nashville hospital, to St. Thomas Outpatient Neurosurgery Center, more than any other facility in the nation. The clinic is not affiliated with the hospital though it is on the property.Latham, who has worked around the clock and personally supervised the treatment of every infected person at the hospital, praised the staff.""My involvement with these patients has also made me a key eyewitness to another extraordinary story -- one of selfless sacrifice and caring among nurses, associates and physicians who have come forward to help in ways that I never imagined,"" Latham said.He said hospital employees ranging from telephone operators answering calls from scared patients to heart doctors who volunteered to work in the ER have helped the hospital cope with what was a ""horrific"" situation.St. Thomas is not out of the woods yet. On Friday, officials confirmed another 111 patients of the Outpatient Neurosurgery Center in the building may have received tainted medicine from one of the lots as early as early June. Some of them may have to come in for tests. (Reporting by Tim Ghianni; Writing by Greg McCune; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)"
2,WELLNESS,Nestle And General Mills To Cut Sugar In Kids' Cereals Outside Of US,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nestle-cereal-sugar-general-mills_us_5b9c685ae4b03a1dcc7e6920,"""The food industry is really focusing on reformulating products that they've always marketed to children, which are some",2012-10-14,"In this June 16, 2011 photo, boxes of Cheerios are shown in a store in Akron, N.Y.

America* Food and beverage firms under pressure over obesity* Campaigners say unhealthy cereals still targeted at kidsBy Emma ThomassonORBE, Switzerland, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Nestle SA and General Mills Inc will cut sugar and salt in the children's breakfast cereals they jointly market outside North America, the latest attempt by major food companies to respond to health concerns.The two have been in a joint venture since 1990 to sell Nestle-brand cereals such as Cheerios in more than 140 countries outside the United States and Canada, markets which account for about half total global cereal sales of some $25 billion.They say they will reformulate 20 cereal brands popular with children and teenagers by 2015, boosting wholegrains and calcium and aiming for average reductions of 24 percent in sugar and 12 percent in sodium.The reformulation will affect about 5.3 billion portions of cereals sold each year.The 50/50 joint venture called Cereal Partners Worldwide (CPW) is the second-biggest breakfast cereal producer after Kellogg Co but is Europe's leading manufacturer of children's cereal. It had sales of 1.9 billion Swiss francs ($2 billion) in 2011.CPW Chief Executive Jeffrey Harmening said the plan builds on efforts started in 2003 to improve the nutritional profile of cereals. The group has cut almost 900 tonnes of salt and more than 9,000 tonnes of sugar from its recipes since then.""A certain number of moms don't want their kids to have as much sugar as they do right now, so that is a barrier for some to purchasing breakfast cereal,"" Harmening told Reuters at CPW's new global innovation centre in the Swiss town of Orbe.The move comes as food and beverage companies seek to preempt tougher regulation due to the global obesity epidemic by offering healthier products or smaller portions.The World Health Organisation estimated there were over 42 million overweight children under the age of five in 2010. It says obesity in Europe is already responsible for up to 8 percent of health costs and up to 13 percent of deaths. HIGH IN SUGARA study this year by British consumer magazine Which? found that 32 of the 50 top-selling cereals were high in sugar, with almost all those aimed at children - including Cheerios - recording levels of sugar similar to chocolate biscuits.However it did say that most cereals had significantly lower levels of salt than a few years ago and judged Nestle's Shredded Wheat the healthiest, with low levels of sugar, fat and salt.Malcolm Clark, coordinator of the Children's Food Campaign of Britain's Sustain charity, which seeks to protect children from junk food marketing, was sceptical about the Nestle move.""Reformulating is great, but the question is how they then talk about their products. They can't talk about them being healthy. They will be mildly less unhealthy than they were before,"" he said.Harmening defended breakfast cereals as a low-calorie, high-nutrition option and said children who eat them tend to have a lower body mass index than those who do not.Kellogg - which makes some of the sweetest cereals according to several surveys - has also reformulated some brands in recent years to cut sugar, as has General Mills for the cereals it produces for the North American market.McDonald's Corp is including apples and cutting calories in its Happy Meals for kids, while Kraft Foods Group Inc has stopped advertising Kool-Aid and Oreos to children. It has also cut sugar and salt in some products.In a report earlier this year, Yale University's Rudd Center for Food Policy & Obesity said U.S. cereal producers are offseting the benefits of cutting sugar and adding wholegrains by targeting kids with more ads for their unhealthiest products. LESS MARKETING""There is a fundamental difference between what the food industry thinks is improvement and what the public health community thinks is improvement,"" said Dr Jennifer Harris, director of marketing initiatives at the Rudd Center.""The food industry is really focusing on reformulating products that they've always marketed to children, which are some of their highest-sugar products, whereas what we want to see is less marketing overall for unhealthy products.""Harmening said CPW's move was driven by consumers rather than a threat of tougher regulation, which he said could backfire as people might switch to less healthy alternatives.""If we're not delivering what they want, somebody else will deliver what they are looking for. The consumers are the judge.""He said the biggest challenge was to improve the nutritional profile of cereals without compromising on taste.At CPW's research centre in Orbe, food scientists are already testing recipes that comply with the new targets, experimenting with cooking and drying techniques to maintain flavour even with less sugar and salt and more wholegrain.Trained teams of sensory experts sample the new products in laboratories where different coloured lights force them to focus on taste rather than appearance of the cereals.""We spend an enormous amount of time and money so that consumers don't perceive the changes,"" said Harmening. ""That is a competitive advantage for us because - to the extent we can crack that - we will receive a benefit from consumers."" ($1 = 0.9349 Swiss francs) (Editing by David Holmes)"

To start off, the central bank will buy $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities per month.""This policy not only helps strengthen the U.S. economic recovery, but by boosting U.S. spending and growth, it has the effect of helping support the global economy as well,"" Bernanke said.When the Fed launched its second round of monetary policy stimulus, known as quantitative easing, in 2010 many finance ministers around the world accused the United States of pursuing a beggar-thy-neighbor policy.Bernanke argued the open-ended nature of the third round of bond buys or QE3 makes the program more flexible and should make people feel more certain that economic growth, which registered a paltry 1.3 percent annual rate in the second quarter, will pick up steam.""An easing in financial conditions and greater public confidence should help promote more rapid economic growth and faster job gains over coming quarters,"" said the Fed chief, a student of the Great Depression by training.In response to the financial crisis and deep recession of 2007-2009, the Fed cut official interest rates to near zero and bought some $2.3 trillion in mortgage and U.S. Treasury securities in an effort to stimulate investment and boost employment.U.S. job growth remains lackluster, but the unemployment rate did fall to 7.8 percent in September, its lowest in nearly four years.For Bernanke, what is good for the world's largest economy is ultimately, on a net basis, good for the world economy as well.""Assessments of the international impact of U.S. monetary policies should give appropriate weight to their beneficial effects on global growth and stability,"" he said."

It feels too quick for an intermission. Such was the case at the Manhattan Theatre Club revival of Henrik Ibsen's An Enemy of the People, starring Richard Thomas and Boyd Gaines and running through November 11 at the Samuel J. Friedman Theatre. Partially that had to do with Rebecca Lenkiewicz's abbreviated adaptation, but it also says something about the ensemble. One member of the cast displaying a lot of fire is John Procaccino, who plays the rabble-rousing newspaper editor Hovstad.Procaccino, who previously played the character of Billing (portrayed by James Waterson in this production) in an Arthur Miller adaptation of An Enemy of the People at Seattle Rep., is making his first Broadway appearance in over a dozen years with An Enemy of the People. His girlfriend, Pam Mackinnon, is also in town, directing the highly anticipated revival of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? at The Booth Theatre. So it's a pretty good time for Procaccino.I decided I wanted to do my ""quick questions"" feature, where I ask questions based on lines from the relevant play or musical, with him. But before those questions started, Procaccino began speaking about the play and his character.""In our adaptation, Dr. Stockmann is a very flawed man,"" Procaccino stated. ""You feel the audience wanting a hero. Miller makes Dr. Stockmann a hero in his adaptation, in our adaptation you see a very flawed man. It becomes apparent that Dr. Stockmann is a flawed man with an exaggerated sense of himself. He's not wrong, but he makes it all or nothing.""While much has been made of the fact that Enemy is coming back in an election year, Procaccino believes it has timeless themes. ""In the show, we see how quickly human beings can change,"" he said. ""How do people deal with ethical issues? How much pressure do you deal with before you flip? I truly believe what I'm saying to Stockmann. We have to give the power to the people, not the bureaucrats. But how far am I willing to go? I wish there was a little more material to give me to make my flip a little more plausible. But this is a guy who is out for himself and probably can't be trusted.""And now onto the main part of the interview...Are you the type of person who proceeds in moderation or do you jump right into things?I used to jump right into things. I used to dive into things head first with a great deal of passion. As I've gotten older, I've developed the great skill of moderation. I don't want to lose the passion I had as a person. I would just like to direct the passion in a wiser direction.When I was young, I was very much like Hovstad. 'We're right, they're wrong, we can destroy these people.' It doesn't work for me anymore. I can't get away with being like that anymore in real life, but I can get away with it onstage. I can take out all my frustration onstage, then I don't have to go see a shrink.Your character uses the word ""grizz."" How would you define ""grizz?""Out of sorts. Irritated.Are you a liberal?Yes on some things. No on others. I have to say, yes.Do you like to read rubbish?I read political websites, but mostly I read books on theology. I read a lot of Thomas Merton, a monk who was one of the great catholic spiritual mystic writers of the 20th century. He lived a pretty wild life as a young man, but all of those experiences informed who he became... I read a lot of Merton. It guides me; it helps answer a lot of questions for me. It helps me deal with political things that I don't understand.But people like to read rubbish. It is reassuring. I think you can change that to people want to watch rubbish. You don't watch the Fox News to be troubled. You watch it so you can be told what to think. You don't read the New York Post to think, you read it because you don't want to think. When you buy the New York Post you buy it to read rubbish page 1 to the end. I don't care what they are politically. USA Today, that is for kids. That's a perfect example of the rubbish that Hovstad is talking about. We've all been dumbed down. Everybody knows that. We've long known that.  Is there any person you can name that you believe is an enemy of the people?I can't think of any one person. I think the current state of the Republican Party has been an enemy of the people. When you make a conscious decision to do anything you can to make people's lives miserable, to not alleviate suffering, that makes you an enemy of the people. To not write, craft, pass or even vote on one law that would alleviate suffering, that makes you an enemy of the people. There was a time when I voted for moderate Republicans. I would still vote for a moderate Republican. But these people have behaved monstrously -- they have done nothing. They wanted America to fail and they did it. You have to be out of your mind to reward these people for doing this. It makes absolutely no sense.Photo © Joan Marcus"

But in the end, a laboratory in Cambridge won this year's Stirling Prize, a dark horse whose victory was announced yesterday. (Scroll down for images of the contenders).Talking to the Guardian, Stirling judge Joanna van Heyningen called the triumphant Sainsbury Laboratory, designed by Stanton Williams, a ""sublime piece of calm, beautiful architecture."" (The Guardian wasn't quite so lyrical with its description of the ""relatively modest"" building.)Not only has Stanton Williams never before won the Prize -- which the past two years has gone to work by architecture hotshot Zaha Hadid -- this year also marks the 50-person firm's first on the Stirling shortlist. The lab itself is set in the campus' botanical gardens, and features a historically important 19th century garden that orients the rest of the building, as well as a rainwater collection system for irrigation. The final call was made by Van Heyningen and four other judges, including Sir Mark Jones, former director of the Victoria and Albert Museum, all of whom visited the six shortlisted buildings scattered around the United Kingdom before deciding on a winner. When the shortlist was announced by the Royal Institute of British Architects, the prize's overseers, in July, president Angela Brady described the contenders as ""human-scale buildings"" that ""don’t shout ‘look at me,'"" noting that ""even the tallest building, New Court in the City of London, has created good views for passing pedestrians.""Reviewing the shortlist this summer, the Observer's Rowan Moore offered a more conflicted take, calling the ""simple,"" ""restrained,"" ""sober,"" ""plain,"" and ""very much not iconic"" crop a reflection of the ""zeitgeist of our straitened times, with their mistrust of extravagance and waste.""Click through the shortlisted buildings below and let us know what you think.

Massachusetts board officials were not immediately available for comment.The panel, which oversees health issues including drug safety, said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was aware of production problems at Framingham, Massachusetts-based NECC in 2006, including potential public health risks involving a different sterile injectable drug.The rare fungal form of meningitis has killed 14 people in six states, with the first case reported in Texas on Friday. The number of cases nationwide reached 184, an increase of 15 from Thursday, CDC said.The outbreak is a major national health scandal, with multiple investigations under way and a leading Democratic lawmaker, Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, calling for a criminal investigation of the company.The House committee asked the Massachusetts regulator to agree to a briefing no later than Oct. 19 and requested all inspection reports, records and communications related to NECC and its sister pharmacy, Ameridose LLC, which has the same owners.""The committee is investigating whether any remedial measures were taken after this inspection and why the NECC was able to continue operating in this manner more than six years after the fact,"" Republican Fred Upton, the committee chairman, said in a letter co-authored by six other panel members. CONGRESSIONAL BRIEFINGSThe committee also has asked for briefings from NECC and has had what an aide called ""several preliminary discussions"" with FDA and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.One of the nearly 14,000 patients given potentially tainted injections of pain medicine has sued the maker of the treatment in the first of a wave of lawsuits.The lawsuit was filed in a Minnesota federal court on Thursday by a woman who said she was given a steroid injection for back pain and has experienced symptoms consistent with meningitis. She is awaiting the results of tests.Lawmakers and organizations including the advocacy group Public Citizen have raised questions about whether the FDA and Massachusetts regulators had the knowledge and authority to act against NECC before the outbreak occurred.The compounding company has recalled the suspect product, surrendered its operating license and has said it is cooperating with the investigations.The regulatory issue involves a little-known segment of the pharmacy industry called drug-compounding, in which pharmacists alter or recombine ingredients from FDA-approved drugs to meet the special needs of doctors and their patients.Pharmacies like NECC are allowed to compound drugs for specific prescriptions, mainly under the supervision of state pharmacy boards rather than the more stringent safety and efficacy standards that the FDA imposes.FDA officials have called for a new regulatory framework, saying the agency's power to oversee compounding pharmacies is limited, partly as the result of legal challenges that have popped up in courts across the country over more than a decade.The House committee noted a 2006 FDA letter that said NECC's actions were not consistent with traditional compounding practices and likened the operation to a drug manufacturer.An FDA official at a briefing on Thursday said NECC assured the agency that it was producing safe products. Also at that briefing, Massachusetts health regulator Dr. Madeleine Biondolillo said the company appeared to have flouted state laws for pharmacies.She said the state inspected of NECC facilities in 2011 and currently is investigating a complaint from March. She provided no details. 14,000 AT RISKThe CDC is working furiously to contain the meningitis outbreak from medications shipped to 23 states. Deaths have been reported in Tennessee, Florida, Michigan, Indiana, Maryland and Virginia.Of the 14,000 people at risk of infection, medical practitioners still were trying to reach about 2,000 patients to warn them to be tested immediately.""We are not out of the woods yet,"" Dr. Todd Weber, manager of the CDC response to the meningitis outbreak, said during a briefing on Thursday.While most of the patients at risk received epidural injections to alleviate back pain, the CDC said patients who received injections in joints such as a knee or ankle also should be checked.They disclosed that a Michigan patient had developed an infection after an injection in an ankle. Tests have not yet been completed to determine if it is a fungal infection.Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. Symptoms include headache, fever and nausea and it must be treated quickly to improve chances of survival. Fungal meningitis is a rare form and is not contagious.Most people infected so far have displayed symptoms within two weeks of receiving the medication and as long as 42 days afterward. They cautioned that patients should be vigilant for several months if they received one of the injections.Health officials in Tennessee, the state with the most cases, said on Friday that a facility there may have received one of the suspect shipments of medication as early as the beginning of June. There could be 111 more patients needing testing who were not on the original list of those at risk, they said.More than 50 vials of the steroid, out of more than 17,000, had so far been confirmed as contaminated with more tests under way, health authorities said.The lawsuit is Barbe Puro v. New England Compounding Pharmacy Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Minnesota, No. 12-2605.
