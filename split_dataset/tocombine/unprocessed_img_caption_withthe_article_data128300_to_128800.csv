0,FOOD & DRINK,Raw Talent: Sarma Melngailis,"Elsa Giannakoudaki, Contributor
Editor and Media Curator",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/raw-talent_us_5b9de249e4b03a1dcc8e252e,"Although Sarma is quite vocal about her animal views on social media forums, she does not want to isolate anyone interested in even just trying a raw and/or vegan diet.",2014-02-20,2014-02-19-HeirloomTomatoFennelandAvocadoPressedSalad.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-02-19-HeirloomTomatoFennelandAvocadoPressedSalad-thumb.jpg,"It was in 2003 when Sarma Melngailis first tried a raw and vegan diet. It was supposed to be a two week trial. That two weeks turned into more than ten years. Today, she is at the helms of one of the best raw restaurants in New York called ""Pure Food and Wine."" She is also the woman behind ""One Lucky Duck,"" a small chain of pressed juice and healthy snack shops. Sarma has lots to tell us about her conversion to a raw and vegan diet and offers up tantalizing recipes for Morning Sun Juice, Heirloom Tomato, Fennel, and Avocado Pressed Salad, and Chocolate Macaroons, treats found at some of her shops.""I think after the first week I knew it was going to be permanent,"" she says. ""I felt amazing, like I'd woken up and a fog had lifted, which sounds corny but that's the only way I can describe it. I felt happier and more alive. I was sleeping better, I was rarely hungry, I had more energy, and my skin and eyes felt clear. I was also reading whatever I could get my hands on or find on the web about eating this way, and it all seemed to make perfect sense.""One thing she learned in researching and initiating the diet was that at certain temperatures food loses nutrients. This decimation of nutrients is said to occur at 118 degrees. ""I've never gotten hung up on the exact temperature and as far as I know it varies for different ingredients, but it's said that the enzymes along with nutrients begin to be destroyed at that temperature,"" she says. Without overly going into the science of the diet, Sarma will testify that this type of diet has truly enhanced her health and that of her patrons. ""For me, I know from experience how much better I feel eating raw food, so I'm happy to rely on my experience and intuition, as well as the experiences of others. I've heard countless stories of people healing from all kinds of ailments when they switch to an all plant-based and raw diet.""Feeling good wasn't the only benefit she gained from a raw and vegan diet. For an animal lover like Sarma, it is also a responsible and kind way to live. ""I've always loved animals and have been vocally opposed to factory farming and any sort of animal cruelty or exploitation."" Her stance strengthened with the adoption of her beloved pit bull mix ""Leon,"" whose friendship has brought her to have immense love for all sentient creatures.Her pup Leon, along with a pet cat, are given a diet that is optimized for health. Both of her pets eat raw organic chicken and vegetables, produced by Nature's Variety. Cats, by nature are a bit more finicky in their dietary needs. Leon, on the other hand, gets a regular dose of produce. ""Leon gets a lot of fresh food added to his bowl, including parsley, blueberries when they're in season, baked sweet potato, sometimes raw egg from the greenmarket, etc. He also loves coconut butter, which I think is good for his coat. And when we're out walking, he gets Bocce's Bakery treats that we sell at 'One Lucky Duck' -- sometimes I eat them too! They're vegan and organic.""Ironically, animals are a big inspiration for One Lucky Duck, a place where no meat is served. In sourcing artwork for her restaurant Pure Food and Wine, she was encountering what you would call typified imagery; fruit and vegetables. Being archetypal wasn't in the works for Sarma's brand, so she waited for a fresh idea to surface. One day, while reading Gourmet magazine, Sharma was stricken by a photograph of a duck. ""I became a bit fixated on it. Finally I managed to track down the photographer and purchased that print as well as two others from the series for the walls. When I needed to come up with a brand name for my online store and snack brand, I wanted something fun and unique that people would remember. The photos of that duck always stood out at the restaurant, so 'One Lucky Duck' it was."" Although Sarma is quite vocal about her animal views on social media forums, she does not want to isolate anyone interested in even just trying a raw and/or vegan diet. Sarma wants to entice and educate as many as possible, including those who eat meat. ""I'd rather not cater to a vegan crowd, I'd rather cater to a non-vegan crowd, and draw them into a plant-based lifestyle. I feel like this is how, as a business, we can make the largest contribution.""Pure Food and Wine, complete with a gorgeous outdoor dining area, is located near Union Square in New York City. The restaurant, which is about to celebrate its tenth-year anniversary, serves a diverse menu made from organic, plant-based ingredients. While plenty of the staff do follow vegan or raw diets, not everyone working at the restaurant or juice shops adheres to the diet. That's totally okay with Sarma who never wants to single out anyone for their culinary choices. ""I want our guests, who are predominantly not raw vegan, to feel welcome. Everything about what we do should be inclusive vs. exclusive,"" she says. ""The restaurant often attracts people who may not be that health conscious but want to try what we do, or they're dragged in by someone else. Those are my favorite customers as we generally blow away their expectations.""One Lucky Duck, her small chain of juice and snacks shops has a menu that is mostly gluten-free; and features light meals and fresh pressed juices. They offer two types of cleanses, ""Glow"" or ""Shine"" that are designed to feel a little less stringent than some you might encounter elsewhere. ""I think it's way less scary for people to do a cleanse knowing there'll be some food to chew,"" she says. Although some might employ the juice as a regular mainstay in their raw and vegan diet, for others it truly poses as a cleanse. ""The cleanses are meant to be a break from what most people view as regular food. An all plant-based, organic, raw diet including lots of juice is definitely a cleanse for your average New Yorker."" As with the food served at her restaurant, her juice shops also feature ingredients from organic providers, local whenever available. One of Sarma's favorite menu items at One Lucky Duck is the ""Portabella and Hempseed Burger."" The burger features Lapsang tea smoked cashew cheese, house-made mustard, pickled pink onions, caraway kraut, all on sprouted manna bread. As for the juices, a personal favorite of Sarma's is the bottled pressed ""Swan Greens"" juice. ""It's made from cucumber, spinach, dandelion, grapefruit, pear, spearmint, tarragon, and yuzu. It's not too sweet and not too green, and it's all organic, of course. Of all things to make sure you're consuming organic, juice is probably number one. I also love how this juice has different herbal notes,"" she says.Pure Food and Wine has one location in New York City, while One Lucky Duck has three locations. Two of these locations are in New York City. The third location is in San Antonio, Texas, which seems rather random. Turns out, it was all about making her business a ""family business."" Her brother lives in San Antonio and oversees the location and will be much apart of any other expansion plans. Certainly more expansion is coming as they continue to add to her shops, which feature not just food. You can also find a variety of other goods for the home, body and your pets. Ten years ago when she got started, a raw and vegan diet was not as well-known and accepted. ""People were much more surprised back then to hear about an all raw and vegan restaurant, and were confused about what it meant. Now people are much more familiar with it,"" she says. Evidently, more and more people are reaping the benefits of such a dietary plan, which continues to propel the popularity of her restaurant and juice shops.Morning Sun Serves 2Equipment: Juicer 4 medium oranges, peeled 1 apple 1 pear 4 cups chopped pineapple One 1-inch knob of ginger 2 tablespoons raw honey 2 orange slices, for garnishRun the oranges, apple, pear, pineapple, and ginger through the juicer. Pour a few tablespoons of the juice into a small bowl and whisk in the honey until completely smooth. Pour this mixture back into the juice, shake to combine, and pour over ice to serve. Garnish with the orange slices.This recipe was taken from Living Raw Food by Sarma Melngailis.Heirloom Tomato, Fennel, and Avocado Pressed SaladCaper Dressing, Pistachio, and Mint Serves 6Caper Dressing ½ cup capers, smashed Zest of 1 lemon 2 tablespoons finely minced chives 5 turns of coarse black pepper 1 cup extra-virgin olive oilPlace all the ingredients except the olive oil in a bowl, then add the olive oil slowly while mixing with a spoon. Salad 2 fennel bulbs, cored and thinly sliced 6 large heirloom tomatoes, roughly chopped into 1-inch pieces 2 shallots, minced ¼ cup pistachio nuts, roughly chopped 1 large handful mint, finely chopped 1 large handful basil leaves, finely chopped Freshly squeezed juice of 1 lemon 3 tablespoons pistachio nut oil (or substitute extra-virgin olive oil or macadamia nut oil)  2 ripe avocados, peeled and pitted, chopped into 1-inch pieces  Sea salt Freshly ground black pepper 1 small bunch chives or additional mint or basil leaves, for garnishIn a large mixing bowl, very gently toss all the ingredients except the garnish, adding salt and pepper to taste. Keep in mind the caper emulsion will round out the flavors, so only a small amount of seasoning is needed. Place a wide ring mold in the center of each plate and fill with the salad. Gently press down to compact. Remove the ring and drizzle the caper emulsion over and around the salad. Garnish with the chives (at the restaurant, we serve it with two long chives crossed over each other, leaning on the salad), mint, or basil. This recipe was taken from Living Raw Food by Sarma Melngailis.Chocolate MacaroonsMakes 24 to 36 macaroons3 cups dried, unsweetened coconut flakes 1 ½ cups cocoa powder 1 cup maple syrup ⅓ cup coconut butter 1 tablespoon vanilla extract ½ teaspoon sea saltIn large bow, combine all the ingredients and stir well to combine. You can also use a standing mixer with the paddle attachment. Using a small ice cream scoop, your hands, or a big tablespoon, spoon rounds of the dough onto dehydrator screens. If you are using your hands, it helps to refrigerate the mix a bit prior to forming the macaroons. Dehydrate at 115°F for 12 to 24 hours, or until crisp on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside. For blonde macaroons: replace the cocoa powder in the recipe above with an equal amount of fine almond flour (see page 230). This recipe was taken from Raw Food Real World by Sarma Melngailis.

For a pourable consistency and photo-worthy results, follow these tips.1. Check and Assess: Let the glaze cool, stirring often, until just room temperature. It should stream off your spatula into the bowl, leaving a visible ribbon on the surface before smoothing out again.2. Pour Right: Place the cake on a wire rack set inside a baking sheet to catch the runoff. Transfer the glaze to a liquid measuring cup and pour it onto the center of the cake, where it will pool and spread.3. Go to the Edge: Use an offset spatula to gently spread the glaze to the edge of the cake, allowing it to spill over the side. Let sit at room temperature until the glaze sets to a smooth, shiny, firm finish.SEE MORE: How to Make Turkey Chili That Actually Tastes GoodCHOCOLATE-ON-CHOCOLATE TART WITH MAPLE ALMONDSIngredients Crust: 2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder 2 tablespoons sugar 3/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling 1/2 cup (1 stick) chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1 large egg yolkMaple Almonds: 1/2 cup raw almonds 1/2 cup maple sugar or (packed) brown sugar 1 tablespoon pure maple syrup ¼ teaspoon kosher saltFilling and assembly:  10 oz. bittersweet chocolate (at least 70 percent cacao), chopped 1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, cut into pieces 1 1/2 cups heavy cream 3 tablespoons honey 1/2 teaspoon kosher saltSEE MORE: 13 Leftovers That Taste Better ColdPREPARATIONCrust: Pulse cocoa powder, sugar, salt, and 1 1/4 cups flour in a food processor to combine.

(Photo by Phil Mislinski/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dde622100003100c5b103.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LOS ANGELES -- You're a parent, volunteering to supervise recess at your child's campus when suddenly you spot him. A masked shooter, armed to the teeth, heading straight into the building.Do you consider yourself responsible for the students around you, and herd them to a safe place? Or do you try to locate your own child first?Los Angeles Police Department Officer Charles Dinse posed this startling scenario recently to a group of 60 or so parents gathered in Woodland Hills, Calif., to hear his presentation on active-shooter drills. There is no right or wrong way to react to the scenario, said Dinse, but hypothetical situations like these are what schools need to grapple with in a post-Sandy Hook world.And the more schools have active-shooter drills, the easier it'll be for staffers to make split-second decisions that could end up saving lives, he said.During his presentation, Dinse compared the need for such drills to the need for fire drills, which became the national norm after a fire in 1958 at Our Lady of the Angels school in Chicago. Because of the reforms instituted after the tragedy, which killed 92 children and three nuns, deadly school fires have largely been eradicated in the United States. No other school fire has killed more than 10 people since then, according to the National Fire Protection Association, and an average of only 1.5 people per year died on an ""education property"" from 1980 to 2005, most of whom were adults or ""juvenile firesetters"" on school grounds after hours.""Everyone, from yard workers to principals, needs to know what they’re going to do"" during a shooter scenario, said Dinse during the presentation, which is part of an ongoing LAPD outreach effort started a few months after Sandy Hook. ""Even the kids have a responsibility.""For example, Dinse said administrators should consider installing lockdown alert systems that are distinct from fire alarms, as well as panic buttons with a direct line to police stations. Teachers need to learn how to lock and barricade their own doors, as well as quickly cover up windows to block shooters from looking inside. Finally, children need to be taught about gunman scenarios, and how to listen when an adult tells them to run or hide.""If you don't know how to lock your door under low stress, you're not going to be able to lock your door during go time,"" Dinse told HuffPost. ""The quicker the school can respond to protect themselves, the less likely they are to have casualties. Without that training, you just have chaos."" In this Aug. 13, 2013 photo, police officers participating in an active-shooter drill move down a hallway in a college classroom building in Salisbury, Md. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)There have been 44 school shootings on K-12 and college campuses since the December 2012 massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School, according to an analysis released recently by the anti-gun advocacy group Moms Demand Action. This figure includes assaults, homicides, suicides and unintentional shootings. Such statistics make Dinse and others wonder why active shooter drills aren’t treated like fire drills -- at least in California, the most populous state in the nation. Dinse, who has two young children, knows he can’t enact change through the legislative process as an LAPD officer, so he’s hoping his community meetings will increase awareness.The federal government does not explicitly recommend that schools conduct active-shooter drills, but a 2013 guide to school emergency plans published by the FBI and the U.S. Departments of Education and Homeland Security provides a few guidelines on incorporating them into emergency plans. Given the leeway, most school districts are left to decide on their own if and how to integrate active shooter drills. Currently, 25 states, including Illinois, Florida, Texas, Minnesota and Virginia, have laws that explicitly mandate schools practice some form of drill for human-caused threats, such as shootings or bombs, according to the Education Commission of the States, a bipartisan research nonprofit. Thirty-two states have laws that mandate some kind of emergency drill beyond fire, earthquake or tornado, but leave the definition up to local entities, a rep from the National Conference of State Legislatures said to HuffPost. A recent bill that would have required law enforcement lockdown drills in California schools failed to move forward in the Legislature because it was flagged for its potential to add costs to California's already multimillion dollar mandate for annual school safety plans. New Washington, Ohio, Chief of Police Scott Robertson talks with fourth-grade students as they huddle in closet a during a lockdown drill at the St. Bernard School, Jan. 14, 2013. A month after the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School, St. Bernard Principal Susan Maloy decided to hold lockdown drills each month to increase school security. (AP Photo/Craig Ruttle) It's that cost, both in time and financial resources, that makes criminologist Jessamyn Tracy skeptical about comparing active-shooter drills to fire drills. Tracy, who recently helped develop a report for the Department of Justice on crime trends, believes active-shooter drills may do more harm than good. They could take resources from crime-prevention issues that affect children the most, such as physical assault and sexual victimization, she said.""The chance that someone could face a fire is reasonable,"" said Tracy to HuffPost, ""But the chance that any one person is going to be involved in a mass shooting -- whether in school or out of school -- is incredibly low."" For instance, the DOJ crime report states that 71 percent of U.S. teens aged 14-17 have been assaulted, 32 percent had been maltreated and 28 percent were sexually victimized at some point in their lifetime. By contrast, mass shooting incidents (in which four or more people are killed) were responsible for less than 90 deaths out of about 12,000 homicides in the U.S. during 2012, according to PolicyMic.com.And since research on how active-shooter drills impact children is still in its infancy, districts could be making decisions with unforeseen consequences for children and schools. Examples of children traumatized during such drills are surfacing around the country. Last December, administrators at a middle school in Austin, Texas, surprised their staff and students with an unannounced active-shooter drill that involved emergency teams rattling doorknobs and beating on doors, as if they were trying to break into classrooms. Both children and teachers screamed and cried during the drill because they thought it was real, reported Texas Monthly, and one teacher ""had a complete meltdown,"" the article detailed. In Manhattan, Kan., an active-shooter drill that involved law enforcement inspections reportedly gave at least one young student nightmares about being killed by a ""bad guy,"" reported The New York Times.But a study published in 2007 in School Psychology Review suggests that there are certain best practices that shield children from harmful psychological effects while still teaching them how to protect themselves. ""We clearly found that if the drill was done like a lesson, and they practiced it, it appeared to increase their knowledge of what to do without increasing their anxiety,"" said researcher Amanda Nickerson, Ph.D. to HuffPost. ""There were no scare tactics, no dramatization, no fake guns and fake blood -- that's a really important distinction.""Nickerson, who is now an associate professor at the University at Buffalo, SUNY, helped develop a guide for the National Association of School Psychologists on conducting crisis drills based on her research (one big no-no: Staff and students must never be tricked into believing the drill is real). But she said more studies are needed to examine active-shooter drills' effects on school children's emotional functioning.""There really is very little, if any, empirical research on this issue,"" said Nickerson. ""It's sorely needed."" Kindergarten students lie on the floor during a classroom lockdown drill in Oahu, Hawaii. Lockdown procedure is used to protect school children from possible threats on campus such as intruders, terrorism or military attacks. (Photo by Phil Mislinski/Getty Images)There's also no empirical evidence about whether active-shooter drills actually save lives. To conduct such a study would require ""thousands of schools studied for many years,"" because mass school shootings are so rare, said Dewey Cornell, Ph.D., a threat assessment expert and a professor at the Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia.Anecdotal evidence from Sandy Hook suggests that the effects of these drills are mixed. The 2012 shooting in Newtown, Conn., is one of the worst mass school shootings in U.S. history, and it happened at a school many considered to have one of the best campus security systems. For instance, just weeks before Adam Lanza carried out the attack, Sandy Hook underwent an active-shooter drill in which teachers covered their classroom door windows with black construction paper to prevent anyone from seeing inside.It’s that piece of black construction paper, Dinse argued, that saved lives; Lanza reportedly bypassed the classroom that still had the paper taped to the door. However, neither the drill nor the security system prevented Lanza from shooting his way into the school.But during the Arapahoe High School shooting in Colorado last December, authorities attributed the quick neutralization in part to the school’s “well-rehearsed lockdown practice,” instituted after the 1999 Columbine school shooting, reported CNN. Karl Pierson critically wounded one schoolmate before killing himself, but he had packed enough firepower to do a lot more damage.Researcher Nils Böckler, editor of the book School Shootings: International Research, Case Studies, and Concepts for Prevention, doesn't deny the need for school emergency plans, but he noted that active-shooter drills could have an unintended and tragic side effect.""We know that perpetrators often fantasize about their deeds long time before committing them,"" wrote Böckler in an email to HuffPost. ""If they are part of lockdown drills and the like, they will anticipate this in their plans."" In 1998, for example, two students in Jonesboro, Ark., pulled the school fire alarm to trigger an evacuation. As children and teachers streamed out of the building, the boys started shooting, killing five people and injuring nine others before they were caught.Dinse believes stories about botched shooter drills and the varying effects they've had on staff and students only underscore the need for more comprehensive training. He argues that it doesn't take many resources to teach staff how to lock their doors or cover their class windows. ""There will be more shootings. It's inevitable because we don't pick up on signs of mental illness or bullying,"" he said. ""Help us protect the flock. We’re coming, but you need to step up in schools and classrooms to spread the word.”"
