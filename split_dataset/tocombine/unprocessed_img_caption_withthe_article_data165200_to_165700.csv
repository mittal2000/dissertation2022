The more you reshape your expectations of yourself, the more you'll find yourself sticking to your goals.",2013-01-26,2013-01-23-Samuel_Leavitts_Journal_to_Westpoint_pages.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-01-23-Samuel_Leavitts_Journal_to_Westpoint_pages.png,"When former U.S. Marine Jason Scott Johnson set out to write a book on everyday fitness, he faced an unusual challenge. Not only would he have to boil down his intensive workout regimen into widely accessible tips, but he'd also have to translate his sense of discipline into words that would motivate ordinary readers to set clear health goals and stick with them.Johnson arrived at a set of motivational tactics that, interestingly enough, have been used by psychologists for decades and studied by neuroscientists for nearly as long. The wide range of personal problems to which psychotherapists have applied concepts like these, and the level of detail at which brain researchers have explored them, can help us pinpoint some of the subtle tricks that our minds play on us every day. These ""trade secrets"" of the brain can also provide us some clues about how to hack our mental processes and get them working on our side.Take, for instance, Johnson's suggestion of keeping a ""Win Journal"" for noting small successes on a daily basis. Psychotherapists have a long history of advising patients to keep a journal like this, for purposes such as sticking to new year's resolutions and overcoming chronic depression. And that's because these two problems -- bad habits and poor self-esteem -- often share a common and surprisingly simple cause: We're wired, on the whole, to relive negative memories more vividly than positive ones.We've found evidence that even animals like mice share this tendency of ours, and scientists have a pretty good idea of why natural selection tends to preserve it. For a mouse (or an ape), preserving a vivid memory of a sweet-smelling flower or a cool swim doesn't offer any particular survival benefit, but if a certain shape of shadow means a predator lurks nearby, quick recognition and reaction are all that separate survival from death. In fact, as I've talked about in a previous blog post, traumatic experiences can work like drugs, activating unique sensory and emotional pathways that cement vivid memories in long-term storage.Of course, that's not to say that you can't form vivid long-term memories of your first kiss or your latest roller-coaster plunge, nor does this evolutionary adaptation lessen the importance of recognizing when your bad habits and memories turn into destructive obsessions. In fact, that's one crucial trait that separates you from your mammalian relatives: You can choose to keep a record of happy memories to counteract an overactive survival mentality.Whether you keep a ""Win Journal"" or just a photo album, your story will serve as a constant reminder of what you're capable of -- and inspire you to shoot even higher in the future. And psychologists suggest coupling this technique with a related one: giving yourself little rewards, like a dinner out or a drive in the countryside, every time you meet a milestone or step outside your comfort zone. The more you reshape your expectations of yourself and reward yourself when you defy those old limits, the more you'll find yourself sticking to your goals.The stories we tell ourselves about ourselves, whether we're conscious that we're telling them or not, exert quite a pull on our will power and self-control. From birth until death, our brains never stop looking for ways to perform common tasks more efficiently, and that means it's not easy to reshape neural pathways that have gotten comfortable playing out the same old habits. But the good news is that dread of change is nowhere near as powerful as expectation of rewards, once you get into the habit of expecting them. So what kind of story do you want to tell yourself this year?"
1,IMPACT,What We Can Learn About Privacy From Jodie Foster and Steubenville,"Marianne Mollmann, Contributor

But who are we to determine what, when and where anyone else must share about their private lives? Privacy is a human right.",2013-01-26,"This image released by NBC shows Jodie Foster, recipient of the Cecil B. Demille Award, during the 70th Annual Golden Globe Awards at the Beverly Hilton Hotel on Jan. 13, 2013, in Beverly Hills, Calif. (AP Photo/NBC, Paul Drinkwater)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb1a3141f000025012358c0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week Jodie Foster received a lifetime achievement award at the Golden Globes and accepted it by thanking her loved ones and sharing her dislike of intrusions of privacy. Since then she has been subject to much criticism, ranging from swipes at her continued friendship with Mel Gibson to bitterness that she didn't say ""I am lesbian"" to anger that she hadn't come out as gay before. Many pundits seem to think she was ""rambling,"" and some were clearly amused that she shared so much in a speech about not wanting others to pry.Maybe I don't watch enough award ceremonies, but to my mind her acceptance speech was neither rambling nor exceptional in its content. Jodie Foster thanked her family, agent and friends coherently and with grace. The delivery, perhaps, was exceptional. In a time when reality television has made even over-sharing seem superficial, Jodie Foster managed to be simultaneously vulnerable and in control. In fact, the most interesting aspect of Jodie Foster's speech is the criticism it has caused. Why do we think we get to tell people who their friends should be? Why are we obsessed with Jodie Foster saying, specifically, that she is a ""lesbian"" when she did actually say her co-parent and ex-partner of many years is a woman? And who are we to determine what, when and where anyone else must share about their private lives?Privacy is a human right. It is also intimately linked to privilege. The most destitute among us -- the homeless -- live their lives entirely in public. In fact, the connection between privilege and privacy is nuanced and linked to other expressions of privilege and power than mere possessions. In her book Sister Citizen, Melissa Harris-Perry explores the effect of race and gender stereotypes on black women's sense of privacy. Harris-Perry argues that many black women in the United States are caught between negative stereotypes that paint them as lazy, angry and oversexualized on the one hand, and, on the other, positive stereotypes that set impossible expectations for them as fiercely independent and unfailingly strong in the face of adversity. As a result, many have little truly private spaces, as their actions and motives are subject to exaggerated scrutiny. A white woman's decision to apply for food stamps, for example, may be vilified by some but is rarely attributed to her color, and her private motivation to do so is not scrutinized against the backdrop of an expectation that she mooch because she is white. The point here is not so much that gender, class and race stereotypes can be damaging -- though they obviously can and are. The point is that, as a society, we feel entitled to strip people of their privacy rights when they appear to transgress how we believe they should live their lives. Dharun Ravi felt entitled to expose Tyler Clementi's private life because Clementi wasn't heterosexual. Ma'lik Richmond, Trenton Mays and many other students from Steubenville High School felt entitled to expose the private life of a fellow adolescent because she wasn't sober. Hordes of anti-choicers believe it is entirely reasonable to require women to lay bare their private reasons to want to terminate a pregnancy before they can access health care they know they need.In fact, we are extremely hypocritical in our approach to privacy. Juxtapose the outcry over Jodie Foster's not-quite-out-enough speech with growing concern over adolescent over-sharing and (malignant or ignorant) non-consensual exposure of others over social media. We chide children for ""outing"" each other but are outraged when a perfect stranger doesn't ""out"" herself and her private life enough to us. Meanwhile, those who are homeless or otherwise forced to live their lives in public are often criminalized for doing so, in the shape of laws that punish sleeping rough, vagrancy, loitering or public urination. And in Jodie Foster's case, it is her failure to disclose that she is gay that angers pundits; had we believed her to be straight, it is unlikely that her call for respect of privacy would have caused such a stir.Thinking about privacy in a more coherent (and rights-related) manner doesn't mean we can't have opinions about the politics of sharing. I believe that those of us who are able and ready should challenge the stereotypes that cause injustice and abuse. Activism, as they say, is the rent we pay to live in this world. But this is my private belief, and I don't think I have a right to impose it on others. Moreover, I don't think any of us can know when someone else is able and ready to use their private experience and identity to bust myths. For some, decisions about when and if to stand up against injustice have to do with privilege and power. It is, after all, easier to challenge an unjust arrest, for example, if you can pay for a proper lawyer and aren't fighting assumptions about your guilt because of your race, gender, age, previous arrests or marital status. For others, it has to do with privacy as a precious possession they don't want to lose, often because they don't have much of it. This is where privilege and lack of resources converge: We expect both celebrities and those who are homeless to have very little privacy. Jodie Foster has chosen to transgress these expectations by demanding her right to share if, when and what she wants about herself. This, in itself, is a form of human rights activism we should celebrate.This article was first published on RHRealityCheck."

Stay up to date by signing up at www.educationenvoy.org.If one thing was made clear by the scale of the recent anti-child slavery demonstration of 200,000 young people in the Burmese capital Rangoon, it is that regimes can repress for a time but they cannot maintain their repression indefinitely. The marches show that while children may disappear one by one into slavery, sold off by relatives or neighbours, becoming in effect invisible people - the victims' cries for help cannot be silenced forever, and eventually the truth will out.The protests by girls planned for February across Africa and Asia show that while men may try to stereotype women as second-class citizens, truth will travel faster than lies -- and that girls are fighting back, connecting with other girls on Twitter, Facebook and YouTube. So, in 2013, we are starting to move from decades of adult complacency, dominated by a false assumption that progress to end child exploitation -- whether it be child labour, forced marriage, or discrimination against girls -- was somehow inexorable and only a matter of time. The next stage is for girls, who have been the victims of the world's inaction for so long, to force the world to see that change will only happen if it is made to happen. And what's happened so dramatically in India and Pakistan is also happening elsewhere as the power of girls takes on a new form. Even before the Indian rape, Nepal had been witnessing widespread demonstrations condemning violence against women. In Burma, a campaign against child trafficking brought 200,000 young people to that country's first open-air pop concert of modern times. And again in India, a march against child labour was led by 100 boys and girls who at ages as young as 8, 9 and 10 had been rescued from bonded labour. But perhaps even more significant is the growth in Bangladesh of 'child marriage-free zones'. Here girls themselves declare that they will not be forced into marriage, and demand that, through their community, their right to say 'no' is upheld. They assert that in their area not just they themselves but all girls will be protected from early marriage against their will. The new self-conscious assertion by girls of their collective rights is the shape of the year to come. Given that so many female rights in so many countries have been promised and yet have still to be established -- the right to a childhood free of marriage, the right to go to school, the right to be protected against violence -- then the Bangladeshi movement is one that is likely to spread to the rest of the continent. Laws will have to change, to guarantee girls' rights in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (adopted in 1979). UNICEF has collaborated with the NGO Working Group for Girls, an international network of 400 non-governmental organisations, as well as many other civil society organisations, specialised agencies and professional media groups to push for girls' empowerment. But the quickest and most effective advance we could secure immediately is to move girls out of exploitation and into education. Before Malala was shot she was planning to link her call for universal girls' education to a demand for an end to the child labour that imprisons girls in everything from cocoa farms to domestic service, and can hold them back from schooling. Thirty-two million girls do not even get to first grade in primary school. In 2013 we could target the off-track countries -- Pakistan, Nigeria, India, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and the conflict-affected countries of Yemen, Afghanistan, South Sudan and Democratic Republic of Congo -- and make big progress. Of course, the issues will now be fought out on the streets and on the airwaves, but the hallmark of 2013 is already clearly visible: it is the year when a new form of female empowerment will not only change the way we see the world, but finally deliver rights that have been denied for too long -- and that starts with every girl's right to an education."

Since it's my first time attending, my goal in coming here to the World Economic Forum was to attend the sessions where I could gain the greatest insights to take back to my work at Adecco Staffing U.S. Yesterday I was lucky enough to attend a session titled, ""The Human Capital Context,"" and it was one that really resonated with me, given that talent is a core part of Adecco's DNA.The session featured a panel of experts from different facets of the employment equation --including the London School of Economics and Political Science, Hilton Worldwide, PricewaterhouseCoopers International, China Europe International Business School, and Adecco Group's global CEO Patrick G. De Maeseneire.What was especially interesting for me to learn is just how serious the youth unemployment issue is globally. More than 75 million young people around the world are unemployed and those numbers continue to increase, given the ongoing economic problems facing areas such as Europe and the U.S. Despite the seriousness of this issue, however, it interestingly hasn't gotten as much attention in the states as it has in other parts of world. Given the U.S. unemployment rate for this demographic is 15 percent, it seems we should be making this a higher priority issue.An element even more troubling than the youth unemployment rate is a theme I've heard over and over during the past few years -- and again during this panel. It's not that there aren't jobs out there -- because there are in many cases -- it's that there aren't enough qualified candidates to fill those open positions; something that's especially true for young workers. I learned that in Europe there are an estimated 3 million jobs that cannot be filled, despite the fact that 25 million people, mostly young people, are out of work.This is, quite simply, troubling -- not only for a professional like me who works in the staffing industry and prides myself in helping put people to work each day, but it should also be for business owners, the U.S. workforce, and educational institutions. The panelists agreed that the education system is not serving students well by teaching skills that simply don't translate to the ""real world."" It's no longer just about the need to train around the hard skills anymore -- soft skills and behaviors, such as discipline or reliability, are also lacking.Perhaps this issue in particular really resonated with me because I feel so passionate about the importance of fixing the skills gap that exists in our country. Certainly big business can't bear all of the blame about the unemployment rate among youth, but organizations must begin to invest time and effort into candidates that have promise but may not have 100 percent of the skills or the training that are required. And for someone like me, who is in the business of putting people to work, I take responsibility in ensuring we're doing what we can to provide job seekers with the right training. The goal is for them to not only find a job that is the right fit for them from a skill level, flexibility, and industry standpoint, but also a meaningful career path."

This has been possible due to deliberate efforts in providing prevention and healthcare, and improving the various social determinants of health. Yet, nearly ten million children die before reaching their ﬁfth birthday and half a million women die each year in child birth. Many others die in and as a consequence of natural disasters and pandemics. We now know that it is not realistic to end such threats to public health; the real key lies in increasing the resiliency of individuals, communities and systems to face the odds that lead to death, disease and disability. I am fascinated by the concept of resilience in the public health sector and want to share four poignant examples of how different actors in and around Bangladesh are contributing to building such resilience by implementing innovative ideas and actions.Saving Lives From Killer Diseases: The Case Of Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT)Until recently, diarrhea was a major killer of children. In the late 1960s, scientists in Dhaka and Kolkata simultaneously discovered a simple treatment that revolutionized the management of the disease. Called Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORT), the secret lay in replenishing orally what is lost in diarrhea stools. Unfortunately, this discovery, which The Lancet called ""the most signiﬁcant advance"" of the century, was conﬁned to hospitals and not available to the vast majority of millions who needed it at home. In this case, the technological solution was relatively simple and the science behind the diarrhea remedy was already complete. Having the answer is only part of the solution, however; the next challenge was to build up the social networks that help provide health care services in places like Bangladesh to build community resilience to diarrhea by replicating ORTat scale. Enter BRAC, a Bangladeshi non-governmental organization (NGO) that developed a home-made version of ORT using salt and unreﬁned sugar. Aiming to educate mothers on how to treat their children's diarrhea, BRAC female health workers visited every household (numbering over 12 million) in the 1980s and taught them face-to-face how to mix a pinch of salt and a ﬁstful of sugar into half a liter of drinking water. A built-in evaluation system monitored the performance of the workers and how well the mothers were learning the method. Bangladesh now has the highest rate of ORT use in the world, and BRAC's work is attributed to a major increase in the resilience -- and the accompanying fall in child mortality rates -- that Bangladesh's public health system has witnessed over the past two decades.Resilience Through Local Capacity Building: Community Health Workers (CHW)The global community's effort in scaling modern healthcare to those who need it is hampered by a crisis in the health workforce. There is a perennial shortage of appropriately trained health care workers in low income countries. In addition, in the few places where there are enough workers, there are problems of maldistribution and inappropriate skill-mix. To address this, countries have tried various measures, one of them being the training of ﬁeld community health workers (CHWs). Following China's barefoot doctors concept, BRAC trained over 80,000 such workers in rural Bangladesh. Female and often illiterate, these workers are now trained to treat common illnesses and refer more complicated cases to formal health centers. Availability of CHWs in a village increases access to basic care and connectedness to the broader health system, and thereby resilience against disease. Like Bangladesh, many countries have adopted this as a way to increase their communities' capacity to manage their own health affairs to a great extent.Reducing Deaths from Natural DisastersNatural disasters in the form of cyclones, tornadoes, droughts and ﬂoods still cause havoc to people's lives in many parts of the world, and have a particularly negative impact on poor and vulnerable communities. Fortunately, our capacity to deal with such disasters has improved tremendously over the past decade. Bangladesh is common prey to such natural disasters, including ﬂoods and cyclones. But in recent years, the situation has improved dramatically, due mainly to increased individual resilience and concomitant actions from the government, NGOs and development partners. For example, the cyclone that struck the coastal belt of the country in 1970 is estimated to have killed up to 500,000 people. Compare this to a most recent cyclone in 2007 which, at about the same force and fury, killed less than 3,000. This improvement was a result of many actions taken by different stakeholders. The Red Cross and Red Crescent Society trained thousands of volunteers who, upon receipt of early warnings, moved people from their impoverished homes to cyclone shelters built by the government and NGOs. Similarly, ﬂooding is a common phenomenon in Bangladesh but the damage to the health of the public as a result of ﬂoods has been reduced signiﬁcantly over the years. The work of the government and NGOs has built resilience by making people aware of the value of clean water, and the knowledge of and familiarity with ORT has ensured that nobody dies from diarrhea. As a strategy to empower and capacitate the health systems to face health threats due to climate change, the Life Centre, an NGO in Southern Vietnam, is training functionaries of local health departments in the Mekong Delta. Such an effort is designed to increase the capacity and resiliency of the health systems to face any unpredictable threats.Building Resilience against Pandemic Threats: Networking In The Mekong RegionPandemics such H1N1 or Avian Flu remain a constant threat to human health across all countries, rich or poor. With globalization in full swing, outbreaks that swept through Asia in 2002 and 2003 can spread infections across borders continents. The Mekong Basin Disease Surveillance (MBDS), a network of six countries in the Mekong subregion was formed in 1998 to facilitate cross-border collaborations in containing pandemics. MBDS countries collaborate on improving health outcomes, empowering and educating health workers, and slowing the spread of disease by working collaboratively to exchange information, training, response efforts and disaster preparedness. Supported originally by The Rockefeller Foundation, the Network has now become a pioneer in such cross-border collaborations which is based entirely on trust. Just as risk managers have learned it is impossible to eliminate risk, the public health community is learning the value of building resilience -- the ability to absorb and bounce back from chronic shocks and stresses. When we take technological innovation and apply the critical real world experience of bringing solutions to hard to reach communities, we can make a real difference. Further focus on the concept of resilience and applying it to all sectors -- not just public health -- will beneﬁt the world's poor more than we know.This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post and The Rockefeller Foundation on resilience, a topic being discussed at the 2013 World Economic Forum in Davos.

California Gov. Jerry Brown signed State Senate Bill 1298 that allows driverless cars to operate on public roads for testing purposes. The bill also calls for the Department of Motor Vehicles to adopt regulations that govern licensing, bonding, testing and operation of the driverless vehicles before January 2015. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2e60c240000310055b203.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"DAVOS, SWITZERLAND -- I've just come from an amazing discussion by some brilliant people about how connected vehicles and transportation systems will transform mobility. The discussion focused on how self-driving cars will improve road safety and traffic flow and reduce transportation's carbon footprint.The idea is that if cars on the roadway can connect with one another and with the roadway itself, there will be fewer accidents and the system will function more efficiently. Cars will drive themselves, and the driver is freed up to do other things. The president of UPS's international division said his drivers typically make 200 deliveries a day. If a UPS truck were smart enough to drive itself, the driver could ready the package for delivery and process the paperwork while enroute. Driver efficiency would rise and fuel consumption would drop.Imagine your car taking you from your driveway at home to your office's parking lot without you having to touch the wheel. It would be commuter heaven. Long drive times would not be as oppressive now that you could do other things during transit, such as read a book, surf the web, or watch a university lecture. And since the cars of tomorrow will be electric, the concern for exhaust fumes will have gone away.Europe has been funding research on self-driving cars for more than a decade under a program called Intelligent Co-operative Systems. The project's website catalogues the incredible array of benefits when such a system is fully introduced. They include increased road network capacity, reduced congestion and pollution, shorter and more predictable journey times, improved traffic safety for all road users, and lower vehicle operating costs.Additional benefits are more efficient logistics, improved management and control of the road network (both urban and inter-urban), increased efficiency of the public transport systems, and better and more efficient response to hazards, incidents and accidents.Google is also leading the way in research. Google-designed self-driving cars are used in the search engine giant's street-level photos of cities around the world. The project was put in motion by former Google vice-president Sebastian Thrun, now director of the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and co-inventor of Google Street View. He was one of the session's panelists.Google's driverless cars have logged more than 480,000 kilometres without the technology ever being responsible for an accident. One car had an accident while a driver was controlling the vehicle, and a second car was hit from behind at a stoplight.Technology journalist Jeff Jarvis in the audience asked what the timeline is for self-driving cars, and Mr. Thrun said within five years. Mr. Thrun, a great evangelist for self-driving cars, said the first time in the vehicle is exhilarating. Within 10 minutes people are willing to trust the car totally. In normal driving the car's controls are better than the best human drivers. Passengers feel uncomfortable when the human driver takes over.But accidents will be sure to happen, and the question that was put to the Davos audience was: Would the citizens of your country accept some level of fatalities in accidents caused by ""technology failure"" attributed to a centrally controlled system, in exchange for fewer overall transportation fatalities provided by reduced human error? Only 46 percent said yes, while 54 percent said no. This prompted an interesting discussion on technology failures on planes and trains.The audience was also asked: Autonomous transportation systems require a free flow of information between transportation providers. Will governments accept facilitating and/or managing the process and liabilities associated with this information exchange? The audience was divided between 53 percent Yes and 47 percent No.Don Tapscott is an adjunct professor at the Rotman School of Management and the author of 14 books.

Already, staff has been instructed to cut costs by avoiding making color copies; physicians serving Medicare patients may receive a cut in payments.“We don’t want people to be afraid, but things are different,” Aurora spokeswoman Myrle Croasdale told the Journal Times.Aurora isn’t the only one in the health care industry to claim Obamacare is forcing layoffs. Orlando Health, a Florida network of community and specialty hospitals, said it would be laying off 400 employees due to new Obamacare costs, One News Now reports. Likewise, small medical device company ADM Tronics says Obamacare will mean the company will have to lay off employees for the first time in over a decade, according to Fox News.Obamacare has had positive effects on the health care industry, as well, however. While these companies have reported increased costs, hospitals and insurance companies alike are expected to receive a large influx in payments due to the new health law, Forbes reports. As a result, investors are betting that the industry will see big profits, already driving stocks of various health care companies in the S&P 500 up 7.3 percent this year, The Washington Post reports.

If anything, the political and social events of the last few years are evidence that no one is ultimately ""in control"" and that every player, from the President to the Speaker to captains of industry, is each equally frustrated. If the United States were a software program, it's clearly poorly maintained with many hasty hacks working around several buggy components. However, I have friends who see smoke screens everywhere. One of my friends is convinced that the proverbial jackbooted thugs with ATF and FBI badges are going to take his guns away. While he is otherwise a normal family man he see ominous signs where I can't find them. He's talked this way for over 10 years. His paranoia has nothing to do with Obama or the attention the media pays to lunatic murderers. From the first day I met him he tried to clue me into the plot of a bad Hollywood movie where he is the hero and the rest of us are fools.Another friend of mine is very technical and a wannabe member of Anonymous. In most respects he is completely normal: He has great tech job and a great family. He is absolutely sure the CIA and the NSA are listening to his phone conversations and reading his email, text messages, and Facebook posts. He tweets random links just to throw the bad guys off. Like my gun-owning friend he too has been acting this way for more than a decade. If he takes a liking to you, he will pull you aside, in a public place, cover his mouth to thwart lip reading cameras, and explain how every keystroke we type is logged into a secret government cloud for nefarious purposes. This behavior has been going on long enough that it clearly has nothing to do with cyber-surveillance, The Matrix, or over zealous prosecutors throwing the book at idealistic hacktivists.While these guys seem to represent two very different extremes they do share a common thread (beside a form of tightly focused mania).Guns and computers are powerful tools. In the right hands they level the playing field for individuals and make it more difficult for an organized group of bullies to boss us around. In the wrong hands, or in misguided, immature, or emotionally unstable hands, both guns and computers are powerful weapons, creating tragedies.I do not believe either of my friends, the gun nut or the cyber nut, have ever misused their favorite tools. I'm going to presume them innocent. I do try to calm them down and to point out how they are both very actively looking for trouble. I've told each the same story from my past:One summer while I was home from college I worked at McDonalds in Stamford. I worked until closing, mopping the floor and giving the local police the leftover hamburgers and fries. At around 2:00 a.m. I would start my 45 minute walk back home to Springdale. I had to walk though some rough neighborhoods on my way to the well manicured suburbs but never experienced trouble.It takes more than one college kid to clean up a fast food restaurant. There was this other guy who worked same hours I did, was about my age, and walked most of the same way. This guy always got into trouble. He got jumped. He was followed. He was bullied. Luckily, he was a trained martial artist. He frequently had to use his skills to fend off attackers. One day he quit. He explained to me that it was just too dangerous to walk through Stamford at night. I drew a different lesson. It's too dangerous to be a martial artist at night. He had a ""tool"" and it was too much fun not to use it as a ""weapon."" He didn't walk fast, he looked tough guys in the eye, he didn't cross the street when he spied a drug deal going down.Maybe I am blaming the victim but I really believe he brought this all on himself. Yes, he didn't start trouble. Yet because he thought he could handle trouble he didn't take the rational steps I took to avoid trouble.There is an argument that gun control or restrictions on the free flow of information only harms law abiding citizens. The criminals, shooters, and cyber thieves, will get their hands on guns and hacking tools anyway, as they disregard laws without compunction. That's clearly true about the criminals.But we need mostly to protect ourselves from ourselves. The gun nut, who is a model citizen, really doesn't need many guns to exercise his second amendment rights. The cyber nut, who always returns library books, really doesn't need tools to control botnets. They certainly don't need armor piercing bullets or strong crypto. They are both going to get themselves in trouble. They will piss off the wrong people and get into a fight for no other reason that it's kinda cool to use your weapons for a just cause (the trap of righteous indignation).When I imply my friends will draw the attention of the wrong people, I don't mean the government, the shadow government, Anonymous, or the Illuminati. I mean other guys like them only more crazy. Gun nuts with bigger agendas or cyber nuts looking for credit cards and social security numbers. Or they will get their family members in trouble. No matter how many locks you put on your gun safe or how many characters in your passwords, your kids always seem to circumvent your safeguards. Kids are natural hackers.This is why I'm an advocate for both sensible gun safety and sensible intellectual property laws. And before you start yelling at me how any compromise in principles leads to a slippery slope remember that an argument is a rhetorical tool used to win a contest of words. ""Slippery slope"" is a tool and when it's misused, it becomes a fallacy.If you are truly worried about the big brother or big government stealing our constitutional rights, words are, and will continue to be, our best and most powerful weapons that keep us free. In a war of words there is no collateral damage, and in the end everyone gets to walk away and play again another day."

""The reason why they changed the world is that they were doing something that no one else was doing, and they weren't scared to do it. It's our generation that gets safe with music. A lot of people from my generation of music are so focused on playing things correctly or to perfection that they're stuck in that safe place. They're not willing to, like, f----n' get rad.

It is the story of a revolution, initiated in the least likely place imaginable.The women behind the movement were hippies, mothers, artists, and members of a caravan of school buses making its way across the country to establish an intentional community in the heart of rural Tennessee. Led by Stephen Gaskin, a spiritual teacher and former academic, The Farm community grew from a group of inspired young activists to a sprawling village. And from the beginning, from the nests and beds within their buses in fact, natural birth was at the heart of their cause. The ""revolution"" began in these beds and buses, on country roads, in the hands of accidental midwives and doulas. It began with a contraction, a sigh, a groan, a baby's blessed cry of life...Puffy and blue, the baby's face peeks out from between his mother's legs. We're not sure he's going to make it. The head is out now, but labor has stalled, and it is becoming increasingly apparent that his shoulders aren't getting any smaller. We're just cresting crisis mode now, sweating and panting with the mother to deliver her more-than-10 pound baby.Her husband labors in his own way at her side -- kissing, fretting, encouraging, checking the baby. His long, unruly beard hangs down onto a bare chest, mirroring his wife's own taut and bare skin, her swollen breasts and belly.Just before panic reaches its climax, a thought dawns on the birth workers. All energies suddenly spring alive to help shift the woman to all fours. Call it a miracle or just plain anatomy, but within seconds the baby is born. And both rooms -- ours and theirs -- register a collective sigh of gratitude and almost giddy relief.Their room, captured on film some thirty years ago, witnessed one of the best examples of The Gaskin Maneuver, a powerful technique used by midwives around the world to combat shoulder dystocia. Ina May Gaskin, the maneuver's namesake, was present in that room, alongside several other midwives who pooled their efforts to make the 'miracle' happen. She had learned the technique from a Belizean midwife who had, herself, received training in Guatemala.Our room, packed with folding chairs and embroidered pillows, witnessed the film that brought Ina May's story to the big screen. The above birthing scene is just one of many poignant vignettes included in Birth Story, through which the untold history of the natural birth movement comes alive.If you aren't tapped into birth culture, you might not know that Los Angeles is home to a vibrant natural birth community, rife with doulas, midwives, progressive doctors, prenatal yoga instructors and more. As a pregnant woman in this city, you can find free childbirth education classes and doula services through the LA Doula Project; you can find practitioners of hypnobirthing, water birthing, placenta encapsulation, prenatal acupuncture and holistic pediatrics. With a bit of research and planning, you can have a birth experience tailor-made to your preferences and needs.Thus it came as no surprise when I heard that a group of radical doula activists from the Shodhini Institute would be hosting the screening of Birth Story, the perfect way to spend a sunny Sunday in L.A. The room filled with doulas, nurses, expectant mothers and their eager partners, packed side by side in chairs and spilling onto yoga mats and cushions spread out against the walls. Several women from Shodhini introduced the film and fielded questions afterwards.Named after the Sanskrit word for ""female researcher,"" The Shodhini Institute is an activist organization with reproductive health at the core of its mission statement. Through their 16-hour trainings, the Institute teaches women the skills necessary to perform self-exams using a speculum, flashlight and mirror. This is the legacy of the Farm midwives: women's health, in women's hands. And it lives on in Los Angeles, as it does around the globe.Despite the strength of the natural birth community, the film reminds us of the challenges that remains. Ina May emphasizes that, with more than 30% of US births carried out by Cesarean, we are in grave danger of losing the wisdom accumulated over centuries by midwives and doulas. The practice of midwifery is still illegal in ten states, though the maternal mortality rate continues to rise and shows no signs of subsiding. Clearly we are no better off for all the invasive procedures and routine surgeries -- though, granted, there is a time and place for everything.The lesson illustrated throughout the film is simple: Birth is natural. Sticky, sweaty and sometimes bloody? You bet. A big problem requiring pre-emptive abdominal surgery? Not a chance.In the final scene of the film, we join Ina May in witnessing a mother deliver her own baby. The midwives stand to the side, their gloves and instruments untouched and, in this case, unnecessary. From the warmth of a birthing tub, the woman breaths and groans and pants her way through labor, while husband and daughter look on in anxious anticipation. The scene is peaceful, interrupted by only a few soft words of encouragement from the midwives and the mother's own gentle encouragement to her baby. As the newborn makes his final descent into the water, quickly scooped up by mama and brought to her breast, both rooms -- ours and theirs -- fill with laughter and tears and the awe that birth never ceases to inspire."

If you're usually careful about how much TV they watch, then the big game can be an exciting occasion -- and something to savor instead of stressing over. But as we all know, there are plenty of interferences to enjoying sports as a family: age-inappropriate commercials, unsportsmanlike conduct on the field and waaay overdoing the tube time.Keep these tips in mind to enrich your family's sports watching.1. Just say no to ""enhancements."" In other words, mute the commercials. Your kids don't need to see ads for Viagra, liquor or other adult products advertised during sports events. Use the break to talk to your kids about the game instead.2. Share your love of the game. Involve your kids in your enjoyment of the game. Many a fond memory has formed from the experience of watching the game and hanging out with dear old Dad (or Mom!).3. Be a good sport. Point out good sportsmanship (and call out sore losers). And remember, your kids watch how you respond to the game -- so emphasize athletic effort and teamwork.4. Get in the game! If it's basketball you love, practice hoops by lobbing things in the trash. Use half-time to dribble a soccer ball around the living room. Or get outside and practice the sports you love to watch.5. Have a game plan. While you can't always predict when the Celtics will be in the playoffs, you can take advantage of your DVR or TiVo. Not everyone in the family will be into every game, and some won't want to be ""forced"" to watch. As always, create a balance.More on Sports from Common Sense Media  Best Football Movies Sex, Beer, and the Super Bowl: Are Your Kids Watching?

Author, wellness coach, and math teacher",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/planning-a-marriage_us_5b9cbd80e4b03a1dcc816159,It's easy to get carried away in the romance and the idea that a single ceremony represents the entirety of a relationship.,2013-01-25,Bride and Groom enjoying a moment together kissing,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cbd802000003000fdb1b2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I visited my local Starbucks the other day to enjoy some coffee and free Wi-Fi. I was engaged in relatively simple research, so I let my ears wander to the conversations around me. One in particular caught my attention, as it pertained to my current status as a bride-to-be. There was a large group at the table across from me -- a young engaged couple, parents, wedding planners (yes, plural) and a priest. The plans they were making were as detailed and complex as those made for a presidential inauguration. We hear so much about wedding planning. There are entire industries built around helping the couple carry out their ""perfect day."" It's easy to get carried away in the romance and the idea that a single ceremony represents the entirety of a relationship. It's easy to confuse the ability to control the details of a day with the potential for controlling an entire life. It may be easy, but like the eyes of the audience at a magic show, it is attention focused in the wrong direction. Wedding days should be special; it is a time to celebrate your bond and make a public declaration of your relationship. However, don't be so busy planning your wedding that you neglect to plan your marriage. Here are a few things to keep in mind for your Big Day, and the days (and years) after you say ""I do.""Compromise Weddings begin with compromise. Perhaps she wants to elope and he wants a large, family-filled church ceremony. Hopefully, a middle ground is agreed upon where each partner feels listened to and has his or her critical needs met. Compromise only begins with the wedding day. As two lives become entwined, differing views and priorities are inevitable. Make sure you know how to navigate these differences in a balanced way.Influence Have you ever been to a wedding where you couldn't tell if it was a day for the bride or the bride's mom? Just as your wedding is your day and should be created in your image, your marriage is yours and yours alone. By all means, listen to the advice of those around you but remember that you make the ultimate decision of what your relationship will look like.Invitations  Most people are very deliberate about the friends they invite to be a part of their wedding. They want to surround themselves with others who will be supportive, realistic, and share in their joy. Be just as deliberate in choosing the friends that surround your marriage. We are influenced by those we spend our time with; choose wisely.Beauty Much time and money is put into creating the décor and ambiance of a wedding day. Just because the day is over and the budget is back to reality does not mean that you have to forgo beauty. Find ways to incorporate items that make you smile into your daily life. Any table is brightened by even the simplest centerpiece.Words The focus of a wedding is on the words spoken between the spouses-to-be -- the promises and declarations to love, honor, and cherish. Even after the walk down the aisle, words, whether spoken or written, are still an important part of a marriage. Never assume that your spouse knows how you feel and never underestimate the power of a positive word or two. The best part? When you say how much you love or appreciate your partner, it fuels those positive feelings in you as well. Balance Many wedding traditions have a deliberate balance between the time spent as a couple and the time spent apart. Even when you married, it is important to spend time away from your partner, either alone or with other friends or family. Make sure you have discussed your needs and expectations for your balance of time; it's important to reach an agreement between the two of you so that no one feels smothered and no one feels abandoned.Tradition Some of the meaning in a wedding comes from tradition -- elements handed down through generations that create a sense of unity and belonging. Just because the ceremony has ended does not mean that there is not room for traditions in your marriage. Look to your families of origin for rituals that you can implement in your new union or seek to create your own traditions. These conventions will serve to strengthen the bond between you and your spouse and give you a foundation upon which to build lasting memories.Money It is the rare couple who marries without a budget. Just because the presents are unwrapped and put away and you have begun to get used to married life does not mean that the budget goes out the window. Make sure you and your new spouse continue to talk about money. Agree on common financial goals. Separate needs from wants. Don't let nickels and dimes create a wall between you and your betrothed.Publicity A wedding is a public vow, whether it be made in a private ceremony or in front of thousands, it is still declaring your commitment to the world. After the wedding, life settles down and it's easy to confine your marriage to your private life. Or, even worse, expose your frustrations with your spouse but keep mum about the joys. Even after the wedding, make a habit of speaking positively about your spouse and your marriage. Sharing this commitment publicly helps to keep it alive.Fun The best weddings are fun. They have a sense of levity and humor. Any mishaps are laughed about and the challenges are kept in perspective. That's pretty good advice for a marriage, as well. Not every day will be a party but you can strive to find humor and laughter in every situation. Find ways to bring excitement and fun into your marriage. The associated smiles are priceless.I'm sure that the couple I overheard at Starbucks will have a lovely wedding. I just hope they have planned as thoroughly to have a lovely marriage."
