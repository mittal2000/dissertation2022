Photo by Ben Montemayor. © Halfway Film LLC, 2015Q: Tell us a little about your background -- where did you grow up, where did you go to school, what inspired your writing and your love of film?A: I'm half British (father) and half American (mother) and I grew up in London. My father is a writer and director of theatre, opera and pretty much anything else that can be staged. My mother also worked in theatre through which she met my father in New York. My brothers and sisters (the ones of working age) all work in the arts. One sister is an art, culture and travel journalist, the other a musician. One brother is a theatre director and AD, the other a fine artist and graphic designer. We were encouraged to get stuck into whatever industry we wanted to; it just so happened that we all ended up in artistic pursuits. There aren't really any individual seminal moments I can think of that drove me to what I do; rather I don't really know what else I would do. When your family and so many close friends have careers in the arts, you do have some examples around that make it seem a tangible dream, however crazy it truly is. My technical training ground was starting a small video production company with a friend that saw us produce music videos, short films and other viral media for tiny budgets where we performed almost every role ourselves. This really allowed us to experiment with cameras, lighting, editing, and the host of other jobs required. However, I knew I wanted to get more into narrative work so I decided to go to film school which is really where I kicked on my storytelling.Once at The London Film School I really became a full-time student of cinema, an education ever ongoing. Every film I watch, script or story I read or set I work on, whether the experience is positive or negative, I learn a little more about what I think I can offer in my own work.  Ben writing in the shed on the set of Halfway. © Halfway Film LLC, 2015Q: Is Halfway your first feature-length script?A: Halfway is certainly my first completed feature-length script. I have other pieces in various stages of development, some as far along as redrafted full scripts, but given that the writing, especially when writing for yourself as a director, is never truly over until the scene is shot (and then even sometimes dialogue is rewritten and rerecorded whilst in post-production) Halfway probably must therefore be considered my first.Q: Is this the first time you've been both writer and director?A: I wrote [and directed] all of the short films that I've made that preceded Halfway. As a new director I think it's invaluable being able to write for yourself. This is not to say you're the best writer in the world, simply that, as a director, without being able to write for yourself, you're relying on good writers letting you cut your teeth on their work. Then, if you do find a great script you want to make, be it short or feature, you have two egos you have to massage through the process. The most important thing I've learned in my young career is not to be too precious about what you're doing because things change very quickly and you have to be able to react to that. That becomes harder if you're not just ""killing your own babies,"" but someone else's too. This often plays into director's careers later, when they're perhaps better equipped to deal with it (or not as the case may be), but I think mitigating that in your first works is rather more liberating. Ben directing on the set of Halfway with cinematographer Benjamin Thomas. © Halfway Film LLC, 2015Q: Does directing change how you write? In what way?A: I think knowing you're going to be the one that directs the script can change the way you write, though it shouldn't. I know in the beginning it did for me. I think it's fine if a director's voice is known. A PT Anderson or Coen Brothers script can be read by financiers, actors, all the key players and know what the deal is. I'm not saying their scripts won't be complete, just that the bits left out can be filled in by the reader knowing what has come before so what is likely to be filled in. As a first timer, it's no good me giving a draft to my producer, who knows my work/style from my shorts, and expecting them to have all the time to make everyone watch my shorts and mood reels to get the tone/content. The script needs to stand-alone as a good piece of writing. Then, if drawn in by it, our collaborators will still want to see what I've done before and if I'm someone that has enough of a voice to carry the script. Ben on the set of Halfway with the film's star, Quinton Aaron. © Halfway Film LLC, 2015Q: What inspired Halfway?A: Although I was born and raised in London, UK, my mother is from Wisconsin, USA, so as a child I would spend summers in the States seeing family. With fond memories of playing on my family's Wisconsin dairy farm, I always felt like an outsider in my inability, even as a child, to do the things my farm-raised cousin could.As an adult revisiting my family's farm, I found the chores performed incredibly hypnotic and calming to watch. Farms are a place of tremendous upheaval and mechanical power, but also of baseness, of simplistic physical duty. Farms are so little understood by the urban dweller, of which our societies are increasingly more becoming. By in essence, sending my protagonist to a farm to cleanse him, I want to show an American Dream story, of social movement and rejection of his past transgressions through physical hard work in a new frontier. The outsider element at the core of the film is race. I find perception and discrimination due to race fascinating. Clearly the United States still has a problem with race relations in many parts of the country and whilst I cannot try to tackle everything in this film, I certainly wish to pose some social questions. I'm very much drawn to rite-of-passage stories as I find tremendous drama in looking through a microscope at an individual's life at certain stages of change, of challenge. In this film I wish to take my certainly less-than-perfect protagonist and make his battle the audience's battle. Q: Did you do research while you were writing to help you understand the story?A: I've spent a lot of time in the last few years in Wisconsin, so my understanding of the setting and people was pretty good. I've also kept a keen eye on race relations (as I'm sure many do), and the systemic incarceration flaws over the last years, too, so thinking about the sort of a voice I might be able add to the conversation was key. As a white Brit writing a story dealing with American race issues I thought a good way in for me was by making my protagonist an outsider, as that is where my experience comes from (though of course in very different ways). Ben on the set of Halfway with producer Jonny Paterson. © Halfway Film LLC, 2015Q: Do you remember the first thing you wrote? What was it?A: The first story I really remember writing was at twelve years old in an entrance exam to my middle school (secondary school in the UK). I was given a series of titles to select from and I chose ""No Man's Land."" The story involved an island a ship wrecks off of, and the protagonist swimming ashore to find only Amazonian women. I was very proud of my punny take on the title. Q: When did you write your first script?A: I wasn't a filmmaker that started at eight with a video camera telling stories with my friends; far from it. In the last few years of high school I got into reading literature, mainly our course materials, and started to quite enjoy the required essay writing that went along with it. When I left school I took a ""gap-year"" (a pretty standard break from education in the UK where teenagers work and travel before starting further education). Having lost my school writing to deadline, I started to really miss the process of writing. I started, like I'm sure many teenagers do, writing what I thought was a novel or a novella, a short semi-autobiographical piece based on a particular experience of mine and some friends. I gave a first pass to my father and he suggested that my writing felt like it had elements of screen/stage direction accidentally incorporated in it. He showed me a basic script structure and I started reworking it in that form. I never made that piece but it was certainly the first actual script I wrote. Ben on the set of his London Film School MA graduation film Drift. © Halfway Film LLC, 2015Q: What else have you written?A: I have written numerous shorts. During my MA course at the London Film School I wrote many different pieces, some of which materialized as films, many of which hit the script graveyard. I wrote and directed two traditionally narrative shorts during my time there, one set entirely in a prison cell that we built on a school soundstage, The Castle, and my graduation film entitled Drift.Q: What role do you think film has in our social awareness and in driving our discussions about culture and humanity?A: I don't think that filmmakers, or anyone in fact, has a responsibility to drive awareness or discussion of anything. However, clearly there are enough people that take it on themselves to do just that, and, for me, that's vitally important. Any art form that has an audience, a reader or a listener has the opportunity to evoke some human emotion. Since its genesis film has been used as a platform to engage and inform its viewer, be that for social good or bad. I can't see this changing. I certainly hope to be able to continue making films with themes I see as important to discuss.  Ben on the set of Halfway with star Quinton Aaron, who plays Byron in the film, and Linda Bright Clay, who plays Byron's parole officer. © Halfway Film LLC, 2015Q: What are your short- and long-term goals as a writer and director?A: I hope that Halfway is received well and that I get to follow it up with another in the coming years. I have lots of stories I'd like to tell so hopefully this is the first of many. Q: Do you hope to branch out even further, or is writer/director your niche?A: I also produce. I've just finished a small film set in the countryside in the UK, a dark love story, entitled Long Forgotten Fields. We're just taking that film out to the market now so hopefully there will be some positive news on that front in the coming months. I also have some other projects of varying scopes in the works, some other US, that we'll hopefully have some exciting announcements about soon.Two weeks ago: Halfway: the movieLast week: Q&A with Halfway Producer Jonny Paterson.Coming next week: Q&A with Halfway star Quinton Aaron.Find Halfway on Facebook and Twitter.

Her choice to visit the site of the Sandy Hook Elementary shooting was in response to the U.S. government's increased focus on surveillance and security in the wake of the massacre that took place there on December 14, 2012, and the national mourning it met with. Demolition of Sandy Hook started the day after we visited, the plan being to destroy it entirely before the first anniversary of the homicides. Incidentally, construction of the new school has just been completed on the same site. It's scheduled to open in the fall of 2016.While in Newtown we visited a number of locations related to the shooting, including the outer grounds of Sandy Hook (the site was blocked from public access), a cemetery at which some of the victims are buried, and the home of the perpetrator, Adam Lanza. The latter in particular was pretty macabre, although we weren't there for speculative reasons. Sitting in the car on the street outside, looking up at the two-story house, we were struck by its normalcy. There was nothing to signal it as a crime scene, bar some boards in the ground level windows and a tiny, torn ""No Trespassing"" sign plugged into the ground by the driveway -- which had a couple of newspapers on it the mailman was, unnervingly, still delivering.We didn't talk to anyone in the community about the shooting, figuring they'd had enough of that, but it was moving to see small tributes all around the town to the people who died, and to think of Adam's mother, who he also shot and killed. Used as I am to feeling disconnected from tragedies I hear about in the media, being in Newtown messed with me more than I expected, and I felt more and more affected by the experience in the days following.Reading about the incident, seeing pictures of the kids who died after seeing their names on tiny plaques surrounded by their favorite toys -- planted in the ground with them by family and friends, I felt the anger and disbelief, and sadness, one would expect to feel when confronted by such a massive abuse of vulnerability. At the same time, I also felt what some might consider a misplaced empathy for Adam. He was 20, a kid himself.I kept wondering how he'd arrived at a point where he could wake up one morning, shoot his mother, then drive the 10-minute drive between his house and old school to do the same to 20 children and six adults before also shooting himself. He left no conclusive clues, at least that have been reported on, as to his motives -- he just got out of bed that day and went on what certainly appeared to be a calculated rampage.The last place we stopped at was the site in a neighboring town that Sandy Hook school had been relocated to (pictured) while the old one was being demolished and rebuilt. It was a Sunday so there was no one around, but I stood in front of the building for a while and thought about the kids who every day walked through its doors. Some of them would've lost siblings, others buddies, their teacher. How do you carry that when you're a kid? What do you do with all the stuff you don't understand, or you're angry about? Has it ultimately reset their course for better or worse?Like I said, the recent killing of nine people in Charleston has this trip back on my mind. While the Emanuel shooting was overtly racially motivated and Lanza had no clear MO, the two incidents aren't dissimilar.Perhaps their most striking commonality is that both perpetrators were very young, yet both had relatively free access to firearms. One would think the ease with which both Lanza and allegedly Dylann Roof were able to obtain weapons would in and of itself make a solid case for gun control legislation in the U.S. to finally be tightened. However, even a 21-year-old acting on his hate doesn't seem to shake the certainty of many gun owners that no one has the right to strip them of their right to possess and use a firearm.Beyond acts of terror like Sandy Hook and Charleston, gun violence in the U.S. is an institutional, systemic issue. U.S. police shot and killed 59 people in the first 24 days of 2015 -- four more than in the last 24 years in England and Wales combined. As at July 1, the number of people shot and killed by U.S. police in 2015 totaled 547 (and yes, the majority have been black). Whatever country you compare that to, within whatever timeframe, that's an unusually high, horrific number.It's fair to argue that the factors involved in civilian and police gun use are varied enough to make them separate issues. But, while I agree they're not one and the same, I don't believe they're exclusive. I'm not going to attempt to unpack the racial element further here. It's pretty basic: hate leads to hate, man. Unfortunately, curbing its effects isn't as straightforward as just getting people to be nicer to each other, but Martin Luther King Jr acknowledged a profound truth when he stated, ""Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.""As yet more victims of gun violence are laid to rest in the U.S., what will this mean for gun control legislation? Changes that may inhibit some citizens' right to possess, but ultimately lead to reduced gun violence and unnecessary death? Or further denial that lax gun laws and gun violence are linked, and another ramping up of state and civilian ""security""?Sarah Illingworth is a freelance journalist and Editor at Impolitikal.

On Monday, state lawmakers passed the bill striking down California's personal belief exemption for immunizations with a 24-14 vote, The Associated Press reported. Children must be vaccinated by kindergarten and seventh grade. Those with medical exemptions can go unvaccinated, but personal belief exemptions will not be accepted.Carrey posted series of tweets that advanced the notion that vaccines contain mercury in the form of thimerosal. (The Centers for Disease Control states that vaccines distributed in the U.S. do not contain thimerosal, which was ""removed or reduced to trace amounts"" as a precaution between 1999 and 2001 in all childhood vaccines, other than some flu vaccines.)Carrey's ex, Jenny McCarthy, has been at the center of the anti-vaccine debate since a 2009 Time magazine interview during which she discussed her views on a possible link between vaccines and autism. McCarthy's 13-year-old son, Evan, was diagnosed with autism in 2005. Last year, she said she is not anti-vaccine, but rather wants the public to demand safety. The CDC has conducted multiple studies that have failed to demonstrate a link between autism and vaccinations. Democratic state senators Richard Pan of Sacramento and Ben Allen of Santa Monica introduced the legislation in California after an outbreak of measles at Disneyland last year spread to more than 100 people, per AP. Parents who do not want to vaccinate their kids can try to get medical exemptions or homeschool them. "

Gomez appeared on New Zealand's ""The Edge Afternoons"" radio show Tuesday and talked about her relationship with Zedd, who she dated earlier this year, and responded claims by Diplo that their romance was phony. Dilpo went on Radio.com in early June and said they were faking it.""I’m actually not enemies with Zedd by any means,"" he said, after criticizing the 22-year-old's latest album. ""I just think that he came from such a cool place, and now he’s been pegged as a money-maker for a major label to do EDM, which to me isn’t even a genre. But they’ve pegged him for that, they’ve marketed him, even the fake relationship with Selena Gomez, all the things to sell records took away from the music."" The ""Good for You"" singer brushed it off as a joke, but questioned why Diplo would have any input on -- or knowledge about -- her personal life. ""He said that was a joke!"" Gomez said. ""He said that was a joke cause I talked to him. First off, it's very interesting that Diplo would think he knew about my personal life, but he doesn't. I adore Anton [Zedd] a lot and I definitely had a thing with him, which was nice."" The 22-year-old sparked more dating rumors Monday when she stepped out for ice cream with Gigi Hadid's ex, Cody Simpson. Oh, to be young, famous and single. "

AFP PHOTO/ Pierre-Philippe MARCOU (Photo credit should read PIERRE-PHILIPPE MARCOU/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55943e061b0000c2a1f619bb.jpeg?ops=crop_29_14_1781_936%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"There are dysfunctional families, and then there are those who write tell-all books. The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed that Ronald Miscavige Sr., the father of Scientology leader David Miscavige has inked a deal with St. Martin’s Press to write a memoir titled If He Dies, He Dies. The title is a reference to David's alleged total lack of concern for his father's health. Reportedly, an investigator hired to watch Ronald called the church leader at one point, claiming he witnessed his father in what appeared to be the throes of a heart attack. According to a Los Angeles Times article from April, David allegedly told the investigator in response, that ""if it was Ron's time to die, to let him die and not intervene in any way.""David, who was brought up as a Catholic before his family joined the Church of Scientology the late 60s, has been the head of the controversial religion since its founder, L. Ron Hubbard, died in 1986. Over the years, Scientology has come under fire with harrowing claims made by former members. Alex Gibney's recent documentary, ""Going Clear: Scientology and the Prison of Belief"" only scratches the surfaces when it comes to allegations of human rights violations, and fraud perpetrated by its members. Of course, his father isn't the only family member David Miscavige has issues with. His wife, Shelly Miscavige, disappeared in June 2006 and has not been seen publicly since August 2007 (actress Leah Remini filed a missing persons report after she left the church in 2013, however, police closed the case when they had a face-to-face meeting with Shelly). To this day, Shelly's whereabouts are still a public mystery, but the church claims the notion she's being held against her will is a ""conspiracy theory.""Meanwhile, David's niece Jenna Miscavige Hill also penned a tell-all book in 2013, titled Beyond Belief: My Secret Life Inside Scientology and My Harrowing Escape, claiming that her experience growing up in the church was ""mentally and at times physically abusive.""The publication date for If He Dies, He Dies has yet to be released. UPDATE: Church of Scientology spokesperson Karin Pouw sent the following statement to The Huffington Post: Mr. Miscavige has always taken care of his father and continues to do so. Beyond that, as a matter of policy, neither the Church nor Mr. Miscavige comments on members of his family. The Church knows nothing beyond media reports about any purported book.As for the purported emergency incident involving an investigator and the second-hand account of an alleged conversation containing a despicably false quote, Mr. Miscavige's attorney, Michael Lee Hertzberg, is on record stating that Mr. Miscavige does not know the investigator, has never heard of the investigator, has never met the investigator, has never spoken to the investigator, never hired the investigator and never directed any investigations by him.So let me be clear: No such conversation with Mr. Miscavige ever took place and any claim that one did is provable bullshit."

But the girls didn’t bond over the shared experience, Kardashian told Rolling Stone. “I don’t think she was that happy. We didn’t really talk about it. I probably would have thought, ‘Oh, my gosh, let me give her advice,’ but we had no communication,” the 34-year-old told the magazine. “But our friendship had fizzled before that.” Fizzled seems to be a bit of an understatement given some of the remarks Hilton would go on to make about the reality star. Though, the two now seem to recognize that a truce, or at least the illusion of a fondness for each other, is beneficial at least where throwback photos are concerned. Still, Hilton and Kardashian continue to have plenty in common. They both maintain they had nothing to do with the release of their tapes, but Kardashian doesn’t really care anymore. “We’re in major confidentiality, so I can’t talk about it,” Kardashian said of whoever leaked the tape, adding that she doesn’t really think about the millions of people who have seen it over the years. “I thought about it for a long time. But when I get over something, I get over it.”  For more with Kim Kardashian, head over to Rolling Stone. "

Historic towns such as Sarlat-la-Canéda and Bergerac dot the area, the weather is often warm and there are duck dishes and St. Emilion red wines on seemingly every menu.Cuisine is one of the area's big draws. Small-scale restaurants concentrate on local flavors using the region's chestnuts, walnuts, mushrooms and famous truffles. And even though it has prehistoric cave art and stunning vertical villages built into cliffs along the river, the Dordogne tends to be less touristy than Provence. It's also a shorter ride from Paris on the TGV, France's efficient high-speed train. From Charles de Gaulle airport or Gare Montparnasse, the ride to Libourne takes three hours.  Especially in summer, when the river Dordogne and its smaller sister, the Vézère, are meandering lazily along, you can rent canoes or kayaks at one of the outlets that dot the riverbanks here, paddle away an afternoon, and drop the boats off at designated points downstream.Even the odd rainy day can lead to some good exploring. Because the area has a long history of being battled over by the English and French, the Dordogne is up to its ears in walled towns known as bastides, fortified churches and hundreds of châteaux and castles, including those open to visitors at Beynac, Montfort and Castelnaud.Saint-Avit-Sénieur itself is microscopic.

Whether we have barbecues with friends or family time at the beach, we try to celebrate the beginning of summer. However, as we all head outdoors for these sun-soaked get-togethers, be mindful that alcohol consumption is often higher during this time of year. In our role as parents, it is important to be cognizant of our own drinking, be aware of others' consumption and be prepared for questions from our teens. At this point in their lives, teens are taking in all kinds of information that help to form the views they will hold for years to come. They are intensely perceptive, carefully watching the world around them; and they pay particular attention to the actions of their parents. Communicating effectively about alcohol is difficult in its own right, but an adult who has too much to drink or allows their teen to drink can make it even more complicated. How do you navigate a situation where you tell your teen one thing and another parent's poor judgment contradicts your advice? Or how about the delicate situation of prohibiting your teen from drinking when you yourself are drinking? These situations make direct communication pivotal. Understandably, these conversations can be daunting. Over the course of my career, I've heard all kinds of questions from parents about effective role modeling strategies and have included some of the most important questions below:Why should I worry about my teenager having a few beers at our annual July Fourth barbecue? My parents let me drink on special occasions at his age and I turned out fine.  Beware of the ""double message."" By allowing your teen to drink even once, you may be signaling that it is OK for them to drink alcohol, regardless of the occasion. There is a reason that the drinking age is 21. Teenagers do not have the experience or knowledge to conduct themselves safely while drinking. Teens who drink are more likely to be involved in accidents or engage in risky behaviors. And they do not know their limits so are more prone to overconsumption. Additionally, there are negative effects of alcohol on the still-developing adolescent brain. So if you allow them to drink, even once, you are implicitly sending the message that drinking is OK at other times. Is it OK if I drink just a little at a party and then drive home?  We demand that our children not drink, let alone drink and drive. However, many parents feel it is permissible to drink moderately and then drive. According to a recent National Highway Transportation Safety Administration report, drivers with a BAC of 0.05 are approximately 2 times more likely to crash than drivers with no alcohol in their systems, and drivers at the legal limit of 0.08 BAC are approximately 4 times more likely to be involved in an accident. This is at or under the legal limit. So be careful, and remember to not only talk the talk, but walk the walk.Are there other ways that I can be a better role model for my teenager?  Absolutely. And while these tips are relevant to the summer holidays, they certainly can apply year-round. Be the adult who doesn't always drink when the others are drinking. We ask our kids to have a good time in social situations without the use of alcohol. Show that we, as parents, can do the same. If you do drink, do not drink excessively. Be an example of a responsible and moderate drinker. If you have too much, you can not only create an embarrassing situation for your teenager, but you also undermine your own credibility for when you talk about drinking in the future. Finally, just remember that you as a parent have a critical role in teaching your child about acceptable social behaviors. And you do this primarily by setting a positive example. We are not perfect, but it helps if we are cognizant about how important our own actions are to our children's development and their future decision-making.

""We tried lots of things, figuring out how to destroy the images in an interesting way,"" says Terrell. ""We went through her entire cleaning closet and applied solvents with a Q-tip. We put some in the oven too, but all those just turned brown and red."" Then Bunnen put hundreds of slides on her deck and forgot about them. Three weeks later, when her gutters were being cleaned, she found the images transformed.In ""Shriner,"" a man with an outstretched arm appears engulfed in fiery patterns that evoke a state of psychological intensity.

From October 2 to November 10, select ""weathered chromes"" will be in a group show at Mason Fine Art, as part of Atlanta Celebrates Photography, a citywide festival held every October. Bunnen, who grew up on a farm in Katonah, NY, without much of an art background, discovered her passion for photography in 1970 after taking a 40th birthday trip to Peru. ""No party. I just want to go somewhere,"" she had told her family. She bought a Super 8 movie camera to record the trip and took a photography course when she got home. Her classmates went crazy when seeing an incredible shot on her first roll of film (""Nuns on the Beach,"" now in the collection of the Museum of Contemporary Art of Georgia).Six years later Bunnen was traversing thousands of miles of Georgia roads with co-author Frankie Coxe for her first book, Movers & Shakers in Georgia, published by Simon & Schuster in 1978. The book, conceived as President Jimmy Carter thrust Georgia in the spotlight, intended to show that the state was more than ""sharecroppers and 'good ol' boys.'"" Bunnen shot black-and-white photos of media mogul Ted Turner, Coca-Cola president Robert Woodruff, Atlanta Mayor Maynard Jackson, singer Gladys Knight, and other celebrities, leaders and socialites with a not always flattering documentary style.

I could not agree more. These comments are an important reminder of the many faces of racism as we lay to rest this week the last of the victims of the mass killing at the Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. These killings were an overt act of terrorism designed to reassert white supremacy and to terrorize the black community. As one Reverend reminded us, the perpetrator has been caught but not the killer. The alleged Charleston perpetrator chose the historic black church not just to kill nine innocent blacks people but to send a message. And while his method was vicious and extreme, there are still many messages and symbols driven by the anxiety of the decline of white dominance and the growing population of those considered ""other."" Senator John McCain was honest enough to acknowledge that his support of the confederate flag, a symbol of white supremacy, was a crass political calculation to pursue votes and stoke the racial anxiety of whites. We know there are many others among the elites that continue their careful parsing of the issues into coded messages about the racial other for the gain of political support. They trade on the lives of blacks and others for political gain. This is an important subject to be explored in more depth, but for now I will refer readers to Ian Haney Lopez's work in Dog Whistle Politics, Rick Perlstein's work on the rise of the right wing, and the book Deeply Divided by McAdam and Kloos.For this piece, I want to turn my attention to a question that came up after we finished the day's training. An attendee asked an important question about the struggle around the #BlackLivesMatter movement and targeted universalism. She asserted that when she, as well as others she knew, proclaimed ""Black Lives Matter,"" that there is often a rejoinder from liberal whites to reject that phrase and instead insist upon and declare that ""All Lives Matter."" She asked me how would I respond to this exchange from the perspective of targeted universalism? Before sharing my answer, I will take a minute to talk about the concept of targeted universalism. In my teachings and writings, I have long asserted that we should be universal in our goals and aspirations, but targeted in our strategies based on where we are situated in our structures, our cultures and our environment. Too often our strategies are universal under the claim that we are treating all people and groups the same.Consider if we are trying to get everyone from the first to the third floor. This is the universal goal. We may build an escalator to take people from the first to the third floor. The escalator is the structure. Now someone comes along in a wheelchair. The escalator does not work for her. She is situated both differently to the structure of the escalator as well as from those who can walk. The strategy that we might use for the group is, therefore, to build an elevator. Some could claim she is asking for something special -- after all everyone else was ok with an escalator. But while an escalator and an elevator would both get everyone to the third floor, an elevator would take into account the different situation of someone in our group.Two other quick examples. What if we want to raise everyone up, so we use the metaphor of the structure of a rising tide? It turns out that some folks may not have a boat and the rising tide does not raise them up but instead drowns them. Consider the universal goal of getting everyone out of New Orleans as the levees broke after Hurricane Katrina. The strategy was: get in your vehicle and drive to safety. But as it turned out many people, a disproportionate many of whom were African American, did not have cars. The universal strategy -- safety for all -- turned out to not be attainable for many.Targeted universalism acts like the proverbial canary in the coal mine: drawing our attention to structures and how different groups are situated with the structures so that we can develop strategies and pathways to get all to the universal goal.Back to the question of the lives that matter. The universal aspiration is a society where all lives matter. But if we just proclaim that and stop there, we are ignoring the reality in America. All lives do not matter in America and some of this difference is how whites and blacks are differently situated not only in our geographic and psychic structures, but also in relationship to police and other institutions. Blacks lives have been constrained and cut short.When one replaces ""Black Lives Matter"" with ""All Lives Matter,"" one may be slipping into a false assumption that we are all similarly situated. We are not. As Justice Kennedy noted in the important housing decision last week from the Supreme Court, discrimination in our housing practice and in our unconscious prejudice remains a reality in America. Some have cautioned that by saying Black Lives Matter, we are evidencing concern for blacks and no one else. This is apparently seen as being targeted without also stating the universal. There might be times when we choose to be universal without targeting, or targeting without being universal. But I would suggest that these times are rare and need to be done with some careful consideration.So back to the question at hand. How would we apply targeted universalism in this situation? We might respond, All lives should matter -- however, there are many expressions in our society that make it clear that black lives do not matter as much as whites. It becomes especially problematic when people are aggressively killed solely because of their blackness. When we adopted the concept of a hate crime, we were acknowledging specific types of crime that, when attached to race or another group characteristic, are somehow different. As we mourn the loss of all lives lost, we must also recognize when someone is killed solely because of their group membership and the hurt is particularly painful as it is often intended to be for the entire group.Of course it is a mistake to suggest that only black lives matter. And these questions may also lead us to ask: what about Latinos, Native Americans, the disabled community, our transgender brothers and sisters, and many other groups who are treated as Other in our society? These are legitimate questions and an approach from the lens of targeted universalism could help. But I will leave that for another blog. For now, I will just say the circle of human concern should have none outside the circle as evidenced by our words, our deeds, and our stories.All lives should matter but in this America -- from Ferguson to Charleston -- we are constantly reminded that blacks lives have not mattered as much as whites lives. And by proclaiming our target of fully embracing that black lives matter, we come closer to our aspirations of a society where all lives matter."

A remote plateau on the Arctic Ocean floor, where thousands of Pacific walrus gather to feed and raise pups, has received new protections from the Obama administration that recognize it as a biological hot spot and mark it off-limits to future oil drilling.

Sonsthagen)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb902ac250000cf003a6064.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Shell's plan to drill in the Arctic this summer has met plenty of opposition from environmental advocates. But it might be the walrus that stops them from proceeding. The Department of Interior's Fish and Wildlife Service issued Shell  a letter of authorization on Tuesday allowing the company to have a small number of what are known as ""incidental takes"" of polar bears and Pacific walruses -- or harm caused to the animals or their habitats unintentionally in the course of permitted activities. But the letter lists precautions the company must take to avoid contact with the walruses, which includes a directive to maintain a minimum of 15 miles between drilling sites in compliance with provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The act requires this distance between drilling operations to avoid impacts on foraging or migrating walruses, and as a number of environmental groups pointed out last week, Shell's two proposed drill sites are only 9 miles apart -- a violation of that law. Interior granted Shell ""conditional approval"" to begin exploratory drilling in the Arctic this summer, but the company still needs additional permits before it can begin. The letter is another step in the process toward obtaining final permission, but the spacing requirement may present a challenge.""We are evaluating the Letter of Authorization issued today and will continue to pursue the 2015 program that was conditionally approved by the Bureau of Ocean and Energy Management in May,"" said Shell spokesman Curtis Smith in an email to The Huffington Post. ""That includes drilling in the Chukchi Sea once open water permits."" The Interior Department said the letter isn't the final deciding factor in whether Shell will drill in the Arctic this summer. ""It is important to note that today's action does not green-light Shell's activity this summer, nor does it preclude Shell's proposed activity,"" said Interior spokeswoman Jessica Kershaw in an email. ""If Shell's exploration program proceeds this summer, it will be subject to compliance with all applicable regulations and conditions, including the [Fish and Wildlife] Service's LOA and strong federal oversight.""But environmental groups balked at the letter as helping move Shell one step closer to drilling. ""Shell's failure in its Exploration Plan to follow the law is just the latest chapter in a long history of the company's incompetence, but the Obama administration is still giving the company permission to go forward,"" said Greenpeace spokesperson Travis Nichols.""We are disappointed the Administration continues to move towards offshore Arctic drilling this summer,"" said Chris Krenz, Arctic campaign manager and senior scientist for Oceana. ""While we appreciate that the Fish and Wildlife Service continues to be concerned about drilling impacts on walrus, the appropriate course of action would be to rescind the [Bureau of Ocean Energy Management] approval of Shell's exploration plan."""

Greece has imposed capital controls with the banks being closed until the referendum and a daily limit of 60 euros has been placed on cash withdrawals from ATMs. (Photo by Milos Bicanski/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc151dc240000330022a166.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BRUSSELS -- Countries plagued by a history of large deficits, high inflation and economic stagnation often look for external anchors. Pegging the exchange rate to the currency of a stable partner is one way to do it. But experience has shown that these ""hard pegs"" can quickly become a source of trouble when they are no longer credible. About 15 years ago, the Greek people thought they could do something even better: instead of just pegging the exchange rate, they decided to throw away their inflationary currency and adopt the euro instead. This seemed to work wonders initially. For almost 10 years the country prospered as never before. Large borrowing from abroad allowed huge increases in consumption and wages. But when the music stopped, the country had a serious debt problem, which has not been solved until today. This should not have come as a surprise. ""This feeling of belonging to Europe might make the difference.""Almost exactly a decade before Greece entered Europe's ""Economic and Monetary Union,"" another country had also thought it had discovered a foolproof way to get financial stability. The year was 1991, and Argentina introduced a new currency that was pegged by law  ""irrevocably"" one-to-one to the U.S. dollar.Initially, the new arrangement worked very well. Growth returned, and confidence among foreign investors was such that large inflows of foreign capital arrived. But, after about 10 years, the success story turned bitter. Argentina's dominant trading partner devalued, the U.S. dollar appreciated and the prices for the main export products fell. The country thus had problems exporting. It developed external deficits and growth slowed.Moreover, fiscal policy had not been kept under control, resulting in increasing public debt. International investors were initially quite willing to finance the government, but risk premia started to increase when the deficits became chronic. At this point the ""irrevocable"" currency peg started losing credibility and risk premia became unbearable. Argentina had to turn to the International Monetary Fund and some friendly countries (like the U.S.) for financial support. ""The one key difference between Argentina then and Greece today is political: in Argentina the hard peg to the dollar was a project of the elite, which had never been popular.""The first rescue package envisaged a resumption of growth, a decline in the fiscal deficit and structural reforms. None of this was achieved, as the economy deteriorated under the impact of the tight fiscal measures, which were not offset by a surge in exports, because the export base was too narrow and wages did not fall much. One year later, a second bailout package had to be put together, followed by a large ""voluntary"" debt rescheduling.But none of this was enough to restore the confidence of international investors, who were not convinced that the government could service its debt in the face of mounting social resistance and an economy that continued to contract. Even worse, the country's savers lost trust in their own government, and started to withdraw their deposits. The government imposed capital controls, but then the economy went into a tailspin and social tensions exploded. The government fell, and one of its fleeting successors announced a cessation of payments to foreign bondholders and an end to the currency peg. Argentina took about 10 years to move from its hard exchange rate peg to the dollar to its messy default at the turn of 2001-02. Is Greece a Replay of Argentina?The Greek experience until 2011-2012 looked like a replay of the Argentine drama. During the first decade of the euro the government had overspent massively and the country lost competitiveness relative to Germany, just as Argentina had lost competitiveness to Brazil. Greece also had to ask its private creditors to forego part of their claims. But once this was done in 2012, the situation stabilized -- also thanks to financial support on an unprecedented scale. But even after 2012, the economic situation did not improve despite relative financial stability. The export sector had always been small in Greece (just like in Argentina) and the country is exporting few competitive products whose sales could be increased by lower wage costs. The election of an ""anti austerity"" government this year then reignited the vicious cycle of political uncertainty and deposit flight. When Prime Minister Tsipras broke off negotiations with the creditors last week and called for a referendum, he had hoped for continuing support from the European Central Bank. When that was not forthcoming, a bank holiday and capital controls were inevitable.What's Next?What next? The experience of the last months of the hard currency regime in Argentina is instructive: it took only 36 days from the imposition of capital controls to the end. Law and order broke down as people saw their savings disappearing. When nobody paid taxes anymore, the government could no longer function. In the end, a newly elected president had to be rescued by helicopter from his residence.What could help Greece avoid the experience of Argentina? The best solution would of course be a new agreement which would allow for the banks to reopen soon with only mild controls on capital exports. However, this is unlikely despite the flurry of new proposals coming from Athens, which betray the increasing nervousness of the Syriza government.The one key difference between Argentina then and Greece today is political: in Argentina the hard peg to the dollar was a project of the elite, which had never been popular. By contrast, in Greece, it seems that support for euro area membership, even if the price is austerity, is stronger among the population than the present government. The electorate feels vaguely that returning to the Drachma means somehow leaving Europe. Legally this is not correct. The country could default on its European partners, possibly even go back to the Drachma, without formally losing its EU membership. But, in reality, Greece might be relegated to a, de facto, second class membership if it turned its back on the euro. This feeling of belonging to Europe might make the difference. It might lead a majority of Greeks to accept another austerity program, and prevent Greece from repeating Argentina's tragedy."

That tax rate fluctuated over the years as Bush's income rose and fell, topping at nearly 40 percent in 2013 as his income soared to $7.5 million, thanks to hefty consulting and speaking fees. Only the financial documents dating from the end of Bush's tenure as governor are wholly new to the public. He had filed older tax returns during his gubernatorial campaign, and had made personal finance disclosures during his term in office.Bush accrued the vast majority of his income after leaving public office. He has earned $30 million in adjusted dollars since the end of his second term as Florida governor, vaulting from a six-figure public servant to a multi-million-dollar earner.The Bush campaign voluntarily disclosed details about the candidate's speaking and consulting fees to select reporters, telling Bloomberg News that he earned $1.3 million a year from failed investment banking titan Lehman Brothers, and $2 million a year from British banking giant Barclays. Both firms have been embroiled in scandal since the 2008 financial crisis, with Lehman filing for bankruptcy and Barclays pleading guilty to manipulating key interest rates and being fined by U.S. regulators for rigging energy markets. The Bush campaign also told reporters that Bush has reaped $9.9 million in speaking fees since leaving office.None of those figures can be verified from Bush's tax returns. That's because the payouts were routed through a company he heads called Jeb Bush and Associates. While Jeb Bush the candidate reports annual payments from that firm to the Internal Revenue Service, he does not detail the original sources of that income. The maneuver was confirmed to HuffPost by a Bush campaign spokesperson. The finances disclosed by the campaign provide a window into Bush's dealings before he launched his political career. In 1989, Bush signed on with a water pump company, MWI Corp., to market the company’s products through his consulting firm co-founded with MWI founder David Ellis, dubbed Bush-El Corp.Bush-El Corp. earned little in its early stages of operation -- just $815 in 1990 and $349 in 1991. But that income soared in 1992, after MWI Corp. secured $74.3 million in loans from the Export-Import Bank of the United States. The contract greased the wheels for water pump sales to Nigeria that would soon become the subject of controversy. According to Bush's tax return from that year, Bush reported $150,074 in earnings from Bush-El Corp. that year. The deal would ultimately result in an FBI bribery investigation, followed by a decade-long court battle that ended in 2013, when MWI was found to have made dozens of false statements in pursuing government loans at a cost of millions of taxpayer dollars. The company has appealed the ruling.In addition to the Nigerian pump deal, Bush was closely involved with Miami businessman Miguel Recarey Jr., who eventually fled the country after being charged with defrauding Medicare.Some of Bush's post-gubernatorial endeavors also have been scrutinized. And his tax returns reveal nothing about those operations. In 2013, Bush agreed to pay back $270,000 he received from work with convicted fraudster Claudio Osario and his company InnoVida, which Bush began dealing with in 2007 (Bush was paid $468,901 for his efforts). The InnoVida payments are not directly mentioned in Bush's tax returns.Bush's early disclosure of decades worth of tax returns likely reflects a desire to avoid the criticisms that plagued 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who was pilloried by Democrats as an out-of-touch plutocrat for shielding his tax returns from public scrutiny. Romney eventually published his 2011 tax return, revealing an effective tax rate of only 14.1 percent on millions in income. The Bush returns, moreover, serve as a broadside against Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. In a post on his campaign website, Bush writes about his business successes and calls for tax reform. But his campaign cleverly includes charts and graphs comparing his average federal tax rate to the average tax rate paid by Clinton. In another section of the website, he touts speaking fees (as high as $40,000) he earned after in the years after he left office.""I made less than Chelsea Clinton,"" Bush says, referring to a reported $65,000 speaking fee paid to Clinton's daughter.Much of Clinton’s tax record, from her long career of public service, is already public record. Her husband, former President Bill Clinton, released 12 years of joint tax returns when he ran in 1992 (as noted by Bush in his chart) and each year of his two-term presidency. When Hillary Clinton ran for president in 2008, she disclosed tax returns for herself and her husband from 2000 to 2006. If she releases her tax returns for the years 2007 to 2013, she will have disclosed 33 years of tax records, the same as Bush. "

Clementa Pinckney,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb803d91f00002a02252ff1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Below is an edited version of the Keynote delivered in at the United Church of Christ General Synod on June 29, 2015 in Cleveland, Oh. The theme of the Synod was ""Unexpected Places.""It is great a honor to speak with all of you this morning and I feel very fortunate that I am here, with the United Church of Christ, because walking among you and hearing the important conversations you are having is giving me hope for the church in this historic time for our country. These last few days have been deeply emotional, with a whiplash between outrage and elation. The tears of joy at the Supreme Court vote to grant marriage equality to LGBT Americans blends with tears of loss and rage at the burial of Rev. Clementa Pinckney and the rest of the 'Beautiful Nine.' And so, I want to use these few moments I have with you to talk about the church, and what I see as the ongoing struggle for the soul of the body of Christ. Church is not a particularly fashionable place these days. The theme of this gathering is ""Unexpected Places,"" and according to current wisdom, the absolutely last place anyone expects to encounter the living God is within the walls of a building with a steeple on top where two or three are gathered in the name of Jesus. Well, don't try telling that to Emanuel A.M.E. Church in Charleston. And don't try telling that to Dylann Roof. That young man knew what he was doing when he committed his racist terrorism at Emanuel AME. Emanuel was founded almost 200 years ago as an act of resistance to white Christian racism. Within a brutally hostile world, Emanuel provided spiritual power, dignity and active resistance -- so much so that the church building was burned to the ground by a white mob and the congregation was forced to meet in secret, as their faith was feared for the gall of having attempted to follow Jesus and liberating the oppressed.Emanuel has been Church for thousands of lives over the years; people who individually and collectively lived out the Gospel. It is a community that provided the healing balm needed to mend bodies, minds and spirits bruised from a world rife with systematic racism and everyday challenges. Within that sanctuary, the living body of Christ praised God and strengthened their faith. The congregation also flirted, giggled, fell in love and got married. In that sanctuary, they baptized babies and new believers, prayed for the healing of sick friends, had great meals together, celebrated new jobs or collected funds to support those in need. In that church, people mourned the loss of loved ones and sent them home. We saw the power of the Church when, just days after the shooting, the congregation reopened, held worship and refused to let sin and death have the final word. Both in its prophetic and pastoral ministries, Mother Emanuel has known since its very beginning that black lives matter -- Because Mother Emanuel is the Church. But it is not the only church. Immediately after the murders, many white pastors and commentators on the right attempted to describe the attack not as racism, but as an attack on Christianity. They did this in what appeared to me as an effort to subsume the event under their broader agenda that they term ""religious freedom."" It was a painful display of willful ignorance after such a devastating loss. Emanuel A.M.E. wasn't attacked because it was a church. This is Charleston -- there are hundreds of churches Dylann Roof could have picked. No, Emanuel was targeted because it was a specific kind of church. And since the shooting in Charleston, five other black churches around the south have been targeted by arsonists.The shooter knew the history enough to know that all churches are historically not his enemy. White southern churches legitimized slavery from their pulpits, although they repent for it today. Prof. Harry Stout at Yale explains: ""If you pull the church out of the whole equation, it's highly likely that there never would have been a Civil War. Southern clergy had no doubt that slavery was not a sin."" White Churches were complicit in Jim Crow and responded to the mandate to integrate public schools by founding independent ""Christian"" schools so that they could keep segregation alive. The KKK continues today to insist that it is a Christian organization. And so we must struggle for the soul of the church. Likewise, as we celebrate marriage equality it is worthwhile considering the role of the church in that fight for justice. Unfortunately, the record is equally mixed. Self-described Christian leaders have legitimized discrimination and destroyed LGBT lives under the guise of maintaining morality. Over the past few decades, Christian conservatives have been politically organized and activated to counter even the smallest efforts at non-discrimination legislation. On Friday when the Supreme Court made its decision to include millions of Americans in the privileges and responsibilities of marriage, a group of evangelicals put out their prepared pledge called ""Here We Stand,"" saying they will resist the ruling every step of the way. With no irony, the Southern Baptist Rev. Mike Huckabee quoted Dr. King's Letter from Birmingham Jail as he called for civil disobedience against a law that granted a minority group equal rights.But that is not the whole story -- the history of gay activism includes courageous religious leadership starting in 1965. Prof. Heather White says that in the 1950s and 1960s, homophile organizations saw religious leaders as likely allies and there were times when clergy stood up to police and protected queer bodies from being imprisoned. And some of the biggest gay rights organizations, such as PFLAG, started their work in churches. If you want to know more about this history, study The LGBT Religious Archives Network. They were first located in the Chicago Theological Seminary and now are at the Pacific School of Religion. Throughout the '70s and '80s, even as the religious right had the microphone and formed the perception that the church was uniformly against LGBT equality, there was slow but steady movement within mainline churches, often led by the UCC. Roberta Kaplan, who was one of the lawyers on the DOMA case, told me how important the amicus briefs of religious groups supporting LGBT rights were in convincing the Court to strike down DOMA in 2013. The story of the church and LGBT rights is also my story. I first came back to church as a gay, recovering alcoholic. My cousins invited me to a UCC/ABC church in the village in New York City, and by some miracle, I actually went. (The moral of that story, in case you missed it, is that it is OK to invite people to church.)Of course, I was wary of church. But once inside, I came to love the church for teaching me that I was beautifully and wonderfully made; and that to love myself and care for myself was a form of gratitude to my Creator. Years later, after I had been with my partner for 11 years, I was married in the Episcopal church we now attend, and It was one of the most moving events of my life, only rivaled by the baptism of our son, Walter, on this last Easter vigil. You see, the Church for me, as a gay man, has been literally life-saving. Through its prophetic and pastoral care, the Church affirmed my humanity as a beloved child of God. In doing so, it called me to solidarity with others different from me, allowing me to recognize them as my sisters and brothers, all of us children of a God who loved us into being and wishes us to live together in peace with justice.The issues of race and sexuality are just two recent examples of the vastly different ways people understand the role of the church and underscore the struggle that is happening right now. I know you can all think of many more examples from your own lives -- starting with gender, approaches to science, immigration, climate change income disparity, militarization and the list goes on and on. In order to give us some clarity around the real purpose of church, I want to turn to the recently martyred Rev. Clementa Pinckney, who, in a 2013 speech, spoke about the essential quality of the church. Rev. Pinckney said: ""Could we not argue that America is about freedom whether we live it out or not? Freedom, equality and the pursuit of happiness. And that is what church is all about: freedom to worship and freedom from sin, freedom to be full of what God intends us to be, and to have equality in the sight of God. "" Or to go more immediately to the source we can just listen to Jesus' first sermon when he quotes Isaiah in Luke 4:18: ""The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me, to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, and to let the oppressed go free""In a world that continues to discriminate, denigrate and even murder, God's church can be recognized when it provides sanctuary for all people are free to be fully themselves and free to feel the dignity and pride in who God made them -- whatever race, gender, sexuality, culture, religion or size. The church should not be fighting for the freedom to discriminate, but for people to be free from discrimination. God's church will be known as really God's church when it is out there on the streets demanding justice, as well as offering spiritual health within its walls using the spiritual resources of our faith. That's the church. And we need to let people know it. Believe or not, there are people who never have met a Christian like you all. And I hope that they do and so I want to urge the UCC to get fired up and get out there, and show the world what the real church is all about. We are living in a crucial moment in history -- in America and around the globe. Let us honor the beautiful nine of Charleston, as well as those LGBT lives that never made it to this moment of dignity. Let us live out Rev. Clementa Pinckney's vision for the church. The world crying out for redemption, for liberation, for freedom. Let's be God's church -- in both expected and unexpected places -- and respond to the call.Also on HuffPost:"

I have 5-month-old twins at home.My wife and I were lucky enough to bring our twins home in late January, and our lives haven't been the same since.Stumbling out of bed at 3:00 a.m. to change the dirty diaper of one screaming baby while another baby cries in the crib across the room is an extremely high pressure situation.You do your best to complete the task at hand, but your mind is racing in a thousand different directions at once, and different parts of your brain are sending conflicting messages.""That's horrid! Do I really have to touch this shit? It's OK, baby. For the love of all that is holy and right in the world, what is that smell? I hope I'm doing this right. How do these damn tabs work? Please don't pee on me. Is this diaper on upside down? Please stop crying! I'll give you a hug as soon as I can. God, I want to go back to sleep.""Is that fatherhood? How do you become a father, let alone a good father?The closest I have come to answering that question came from a moment of philosophical reflection while the babies were sleeping.Elements of Process philosophy floated to the surface of my mind from wherever it is I store unused information from my college philosophy classes.To put it simply: the motion of the thing, is the thing.You can't step in the same river twice, to quote Heraclitus. You also can't change the same diaper twice, much to the delight of anyone who has ever changed a diaper.You can't really quantify a flowing river. You can figure out how much water is flowing past, but does flowing water make a river?You can point at the effects of the wind, but not at the wind itself.You can't really wrap your arms around a moment and say ""this is fatherhood.""Being a father isn't a thing in and of itself. It's a process.The motion of being a father is the real essence of fatherhood.For me, it's cradling my son at 4:00 a.m. while watching How It's Made as his stomach cramps subside and he slowly goes back to sleep.It's my daughter's face lighting up in the morning when she sees me walk into the room. It's worrying with my wife about the prohibitive cost of daycare for twins (it costs twice as much!) or washing bottles while she feeds the babies upstairs.Fatherhood is all of these things, but it is also none of those things on their own, especially when you start to determine if you are doing a good job or not.You changed a diaper at 3:00 a.m.? Great job, slappy. There's more where that came from.  You're worried about finances and the future? So was your father and his father before him. It's a never ending cycle. How you react to it is up to you, and what you make of the process is yours to decide.Just keep moving. Just keep doing your best. The rest will fall into place."

But more often than not, this first impression does not allow the very essence of the artwork to be revealed and understood. Two current gallery exhibitions -- of two very different artists -- present an excellent case to illustrate my point.

The various artwork in her exhibition refer to these improbable parallels and similarities. However, the works that appear at first glance to be the most straightforward and innocent-looking turn out to be tongue-in-cheek artistic statements, particularly rich in context. I'm talking about a series of medium-sized color photographs depicting what looks like modest, American, suburban homes, fresh off the assembly line. But upon second glance, there is something strange happening. We notice a hand in the foreground holding a photo of a house in front of an actual house, thus creating the illusion that we are looking at one seamless image. But actually, in each of Clarissa Tossin's photographs, we are seeing two images of two almost-identical houses built by Ford Motor Company thousands of miles apart. And the more you stare at her photos, the further she pulls the rug from under your feet. When you venture into the ROSEGALLERY exhibition of San Francisco-based artist John Chiara, you might be slightly confused by the first impression of his large, color photographs. The subject of most of his images are ghostly landscapes shot in Mississippi, all of them blurred and looking slightly damaged during the developing process. And for some mysterious reason, each image is not printed in standard, rectangular format, but on unevenly-torn photo paper. John Chiara uses custom-built cameras loaded on his flat bed truck. His largest camera measures 7'x10'x12'. Yes, feet, not inches. Such a camera accommodates large sheets of paper that are 50""x 80"". Obviously the artist is not intent on giving us a picture-perfect impression of the landscape that for some reason stopped him in his tracks. With all of these ""imperfections,"" his images convey the smell of the earth, the humidity of the air, or could it be the affect of one shot of vodka too many? Who knows? But the result is totally poetic and captivating.And let me finish today's Art Talk with the ""you-ought-to-be-kidding"" improbable story of the escaped killer, Richard W. Matt, who turned out to be an amateur portrait artist. While in prison, he attended art classes that enabled him to make decent painterly renditions of photos of celebrities, politicians, and prison family members. Some of his portraits were even sold to customers outside of prison for up to $2,000. Do I hear you gasping with disbelief?

With each family member facing the prospect of shattered beliefs about personal safety, one clear question emerged: Why choose forgiveness and justice to rebuild a sense of security?The unknown can be scary -- especially after a traumatic event that invades a space once considered a safe haven from the world's threats. At the heart of post-traumatic stress disorder and other forms of extreme anxiety is a pervasive sense that the threat of that traumatic event has not passed and there is a need to protect oneself from the future unknown, even if there is no threat present to support that belief. Trauma, like the event in Charleston, can truly get into an individual's head by restructuring how the brain appraises situations and compelling the body to remain on high alert for safety threats. Despite the amazing capabilities of our brains and bodies, constantly remaining on alert depletes many of our mental resources for navigating other life responsibilities and compromises one of our most valuable tools for maintaining sanity: psychological safety. Believing that we have the resources to manage life stressors or can connect with someone who will help reflects one of our innate needs to form secure connections that foster a sense of stability and safety that supersede life stressors. The unknown that follows trauma can strip that sense of psychological safety we spend our entire lives building.In the aftermath of 9/11, it was clear that many people at the towers and around the country were struggling to feel safe, regardless of reassurances from leaders. To address this challenge, mental health professionals began employing a technique called psychological first aid. Like CPR, psychological first aid was intended to help the person move beyond the crisis by stabilizing their mental state and restoring a sense of psychological safety. A key contributor to the success of this technique was its ability to help the person to see the threat accurately (it's real but not overwhelming) and create a concrete plan for how to get through the immediate aftermath of the crisis. For the families of Charleston victims, forgiveness was that plan. The burden of hating someone and giving permission for them to remain in ones personal mental space can be mentally destabilizing and recent research has shown that forgiveness provides a pathway for restoring a sense of wholeness that the traumatic event tries to steal. The forgiveness given in the courtroom was likely more about healing for the families than blind willingness to accept the act of a killer. Despite the circumstances that continued to surround these families, forgiveness and faith provided a secure connection that made the unknown future more manageable.The tricky part about the unknown future is that real danger still abounds. Inspiration for much of the killer's actions in Charleston hid in plain sight: a website, an organization supporting white-separatism and a flag signifying much more than southern pride to many. These muses for the killer represented both explicit and implicit forms of bias that feed hostile beliefs, which can lead to tragedies such as Charleston. Fortunately, Charleston is the exception because most forms of bias are implicit, or outside our awareness, and rear themselves in more subtle ways. That guy (insert ethnic name) just didn't feel right for the job. You talk 'white' (read: articulate and grammatically correct). Here's the truth: We all show bias and good people with the best intentions can still hurt others with their biases without knowing it. Combating such a covert foe requires effortful awareness about all of our susceptibility and an active pursuit of correcting intentional and unintentional consequences of our biases. It is this ideal of justice that the United States was founded to create and strives to achieve regardless of threats to our physical and psychological safety that remain."
26,POLITICS,Bill De Blasio Says What He Really Thinks About Andrew Cuomo,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bill-de-blasio-andrew-cuomo_n_7701160.html,,2015-07-01,"NEW YORK, NY - OCTOBER 23: Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City and Governor Andrew Cuomo of New York speak at a press conference October 23, 2014 in New York City. Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo addressed Dr. Craig Spencer, who had returned to New York City from Guinea where he was working with Doctors Without Borders treating Ebola patients. Spencer had been quarantined after showing symptoms consistent with the virus and was taken to Bellevue hospital to undergo testing. According to reports, test results have confirmed that Spencer has contracted the Ebola virus.

Andrew Cuomo came to a head Tuesday when the mayor ripped into the governor's ""lack of leadership,"" accusing Cuomo of prioritizing deal-making and vengeance over doing what's best for the city.In a remarkably candid interview with NY1, de Blasio laid out his concerns with fellow Democrat Cuomo and his dealings with New York City. De Blasio accused the governor of wielding influence over the Republican-led state Senate, which dealt the mayor's progressive agenda a series of defeats earlier this month. ""What I found was he engaged in his own sense of strategies, his own political machinations, and what we've often seen is if someone disagrees with him openly, some kind of revenge or vendetta follows,"" the mayor said. ""I don't believe the Assembly had a real working partner in the governor or the Senate in terms of getting things done for the people of this city and in many cases the people of this state.""De Blasio specifically pointed to the fight over a tax credit for developers, which the mayor has proposed changing to require more construction of affordable housing. Last month, Cuomo accused the mayor of favoring developers over labor unions and coming too late to the game with a proposal. De Blasio, meanwhile, called Cuomo's criticism ""disingenuous.""""I find that to be a lack of leadership because here was an opportunity actually to get something done for people,"" he said to NY1 of Cuomo's opposition. The mayor continued his criticism in a Tuesday afternoon session with reporters at City Hall, charging Cuomo with derailing his legislative agenda.""It is fundamentally the wrong way to go about this work,” he said, according to the Wall Street Journal. “Sometimes it’s about deal making, sometimes it’s about revenge. But it's not about policy, it's not about substance.”According to The New York Times, de Blasio also criticized the governor for increasing inspections of the city's homeless shelters and for battling the city on funding for public housing.Cuomo's office brushed off the criticism while taking a dig at de Blasio's political experience. ""For those new to the process, it takes coalition building and compromise to get things done in government,"" Cuomo communications director Melissa DeRosa said in a statement provided to The Huffington Post. ""We wish the Mayor well on his vacation.​​​"""

28,PARENTS,Accepting Feelings: The New Frontier in Parenting,"Patty Wipfler, ContributorFounder and Program Director, Hand in Hand Parenting",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/childrens-feelings-the-ne_b_7701164.html,Parenting is hard work. It's emotional work. It may be the hardest work we'll ever do. And listening to our children's feelings can be heartbreaking. But the alternative is costly.,2015-07-01,2015-07-01-1435780191-9015028-TinoandchildforHP.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-07-01-1435780191-9015028-TinoandchildforHP-thumb.jpg,"Parents! You're in for a treat! The netherworld of emotion we grapple with daily comes alive in the new film, Inside Out. We parents don't relish dealing with emotions! We've been urged to pat, rock, walk, sing, scold and threaten when crying crops up. We grudgingly deal with kids' feelings all day, then go to sleep at night hoping that tomorrow will be all sunshine and birdsong. Ain't gonna happen! The movie offers encouragement to us parents to give a little breathing room to the world of emotions. We don't have much of a problem with Joy, of course, but on the screen, Sadness, Anger, Fear and Disgust are each winning in their own way, too. If emotions are finally OK, we can begin to listen to our children's upsets. Not argue. Not explain. Not cajole. Listen. It's still our job to set necessary limits: to step in and be the barrier against biting, grabbing, wrecking, or hurting. When we hold a necessary limit, feelings will run through our upset child like storm water down a gully. It's noisy! It's messy! But then, the feelings clear away, and because we've cared, our child is surer that she's loved.The acceptance of emotions is a new frontier in parenting, and a promising one. ETR Associates did a review of over 600 research studies to learn what is known about preventing teen pregnancy. They found that the strongest preventive factor is a feeling. A feeling. What might that powerful feeling be? A teen's sense of warm connection with their parent! And -- this was more than the researchers bargained for -- they found that the feeling of parent-child connectedness is a ""super-protective factor"" that prevents teen pregnancy and keeps teens from dropping out of school, drug use, tobacco use and violence. Connection. Not rejection.By listening to our children's feelings, we can actively build that vital sense of parent-child connection. We've all noticed that while our kids are upset, they have a Teflon shield up against our words and demands. An upset child literally can't think. In the movie, hurt feelings drive Riley, the 11-year-old heroine, to run away. Her parents couldn't listen, so her sense of connection crumbles. She can finally remember their love when her tears begin to fall. She makes her way home, and her parents quietly embrace her. They listen. More tears fall, and warm connection is restored. It may even be that listening to our children's feelings can enhance their intelligence. Neuroscientist Daniel J. Siegel, MD, says, ""Researchers have found that intense emotion by itself is not the problem. When parents provide support during difficult emotional experiences, children actually have the opportunity to develop a more sophisticated understanding of the mind.""Listening to feelings can mend deep rifts between parent and child. For example, one mother came to Hand in Hand Parenting in a terrible bind. Her toddler, diagnosed with failure to thrive, refused to take his medicine. Daily, she had to physically pin him down and force the liquid down his throat. She could see that he no longer felt safe with her. Their days were miserable. We suggested that she tell him, ""It's time to take your medicine, sweetheart,"" stay close, and listen to his protest, all the way through. His tears and fears might need a way out. The first day, he cried for a long time, then reluctantly took his medicine. No battle. She listened to big feelings again for two more mornings. Each day he cried and stormed, she listened, and then he could tolerate his medicine. After that, he took his prescription willingly, and their relationship began to mend. Her respect for his feelings won him back to her.Parenting is hard work. It's emotional work. It may be the hardest work we'll ever do. And listening to our children's feelings can be heartbreaking. But the alternative is costly. Small stresses keep mounting. Our children lose the light in their eyes. Their behavior gets tangled in upsets. Listening to them with love relieves their hearts, and most often clears their behavior, as well. And when we're all keyed up with our own sets of feelings, we need that same kind of support. A good listener! A kind adult to hold out respect for us, while we fume and fuss and change our energy from alone and negative to more connected, more ourselves.Many good people still say that children's feelings and behaviors must be managed, like tigers in a cage, with rewards given with the parent's right hand, and punishment given with the left. But there's not much joy in administrating such a system, and the price for a child's compliance gets higher as she grows. We want our children to think, not comply! And in the end, we're happier when we can connect with our precious little ones. It's the shared giggles and that sense of no barriers between us that keeps our love for our kids alive. So check out this movie! Meet the emotions that you've been told are a bad influence. Delight as they kvetch, deliberate, and vie to be heard. And then, on a good day, experiment. Listen warmly all the way through your child's meltdown. Feelings will pour out. Pour your caring in. You'll be an explorer on the frontiers of parenting."

On Tuesday, the 34-year-old further explained her reasoning during an appearance on Howard Stern's SiriusXM show. ""It felt like it would be betting against myself,"" she said. ""OK, this way I'm secure and I know I'll make [money] and I'll have this job ... but I'm like, 'No. I'm gonna bet on myself that I can do more.'"" Schumer said she wasn't quick to turn down the offer, and even met with Jon Stewart over pizza to discuss the job, where she inquired about its perks. Ultimately, Schumer decided she simply wasn't right for it. ""I think if I heard I was hosting 'The Daily Show,' I'd be like, ‘Oh, give me a fucking break!'"" she told Stern, adding that the five years' worth of potential blazers kind of had something to do with it.""But I just pictured all the fittings, like all the blazers I’d have to wear and I was like, 'I don’t want to do that,'"" she explained to Stern. ""I just thought, I don’t think it’s right for me. Trevor [Noah] will be so much better at it than I would ever have been.""Meanwhile, Schumer also spoke about one gig that she actually said agreed to -- opening for Madonna for three nights in New York City in September. The ""Trainwreck"" star told Stern that she's the first comedian to open for the Material Girl, but she doesn't have high hopes for it. ""I really think that it will be a bad set. I'm going to try my hardest. I'm going to write some Madonna material, I'm going to practice. I'm going to do everything I can. Like you said, they're not here for me,""she said. ""So I'm planning on just taking one to the chin every night, and then getting to see a Madonna show."" "
