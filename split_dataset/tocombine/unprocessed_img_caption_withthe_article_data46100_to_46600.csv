0,POLITICS,Colin Powell Attacked Hillary Clinton's 'Hubris' In Leaked Emails,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colin-powell-hillary-clinton_us_57d96524e4b09d7a6880bf1c,"He threw a ""mini tantrum"" in the Hamptons to get the Clinton campaign's attention.",2016-09-14,Colin Powell complained in private messages about Hillary Clinton's email issues.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d9665f1300002b0039bef3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Secretary of State Colin Powell ripped his successor Hillary Clinton for linking him to investigations over her use of her private email server during her tenure, leaked emails show.“Sad thing it [sic] that HRC could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me into it,” Powell said in one email. He wrote that he “told her staff three times not to try that gambit.”“I had to throw a mini tantrum at a Hampton’s party to get their attention,” Powell wrote, referencing an interview he gave to People Magazine at the Apollo in the Hamptons 2016 Night of Legends party. “She keeps tripping into these ‘character’ minefields.”He had told People that “her people have been trying to pin” her use of emails on him. “It doesn’t bother me,” he told People. “But it’s okay; I’m free.”Over the past two years, in response to questions about her use of a private email server, including from the FBI, Clinton and her campaign have brought up comparisons with Powell’s use of a private email account during his time in the same position under President George W. Bush. Clinton stated that Powell had even recommended she use private email.Powell told People that he did not recommend the use of private email to Clinton until a year after she was already using a private server. Clinton’s own emails show that she sought Powell’s advice on June 16, 2009, about six months into her service and that he gave her written guidance soon after.He explained in an email to Clinton how he used private email to keep some of his communication from going through official State Department systems and potentially becoming part of the public record.“What I did do was have a personal computer that was hooked up to a private phone line (sounds ancient),” Powell wrote. “So I could communicate with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the State Department on their personal email accounts. I did the same thing on the road in hotels.”He went on to state, “Government or not, to do business, it may become an official record and subject to the law. Be very careful. I got around it all by not saying much and not using systems that captured the data.”Powell’s leaked emails were provided to representatives of DCLeaks.com, which has a relationship with the hacker or hackers who refer to themselves as Guccifer 2.0, which has been alleged to be connected to the Russian intelligence apparatus. This is the second time Powell’s email has been hacked in recent years. The now-jailed hacker Marcel Lazăr Lehel, better known as Guccifer, first hacked his account. BuzzFeed first reported on the leaked Powell emails Wednesday.In another leaked email, Powell complained about Clinton’s speech fees costing him his own speaking payment from one university.“Everything HRC touches she kind of screws up with hubris,” Powell wrote in an email to private equity investor Jeffrey Leeds. “I told you about the gig I lost at a University because she so overcharged them they came under heat and couldn’t any fees for awhile. I should send her the bill.”In the same email Powell complained that the attention paid to Clinton’s emails will “dick up the legitimate use of emails with friggin record rules.”UPDATE: 2:39 p.m. ― In yet another leaked email, Powell provided his thoughts on whom he would vote for in November.“I would rather not have to vote for her, although she is a friend I respect,” Powell wrote in the July 2014 email, which was posted on Twitter by Will Rahn, CBS News’ managing editor for politics."
1,MEDIA,Donald Trump’s Dr. Oz Gambit Makes Mockery Of Transparency Norms,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-dr-oz-media_us_57d9b7e8e4b08cb140938acc,And he still won't release his tax returns.,2016-09-14,"Donald Trump revealed medical information on ""The Dr. Oz Show.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d9b8171800006c32bd176d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― Reporters hoping to glean details about Donald Trump’s health turned Wednesday to an unlikely source: the audience of “The Dr. Oz Show.”Trump, who NBC News dubbed Tuesday as the “least transparent presidential nominee in modern times,” continued to defy the norms of presidential campaign disclosure by providing what he said were results of a recent physical during a taped appearance on Mehmet Oz’s syndicated talk show. Even for an election season full of reality show theatrics, the Dr. Oz gambit stands out. Here was the 70-year-old Republican nominee, known to exercise little and indulge regularly in fast food, giving more information about his health to a celebrity doctor than the press that has long been requesting it. News organizations were left scrambling Wednesday afternoon to reach audience members about what Trump revealed, including his weight (which differed depending on the source). “Trump said he currently weighs 236 pounds, according to two audience members,” Politico reported, while noting that “other reports had audience members giving conflicting readouts, with some saying Trump put his weight at 267 pounds.”Daniel Sinasohn, an audience member, offered his recollections during an appearance on MSNBC. Sinasohn said Trump described his hand movements at rallies as a form of exercise, and explained that he opts for fast food on the road because he expects consistency from chain restaurants. Sinasohn found the moment in which Trump dramatically pulled out the results of his physical onstage to come off as scripted.“I think he knew what he was doing,” Sinasohn said. The only medical details provided before Wednesday came in the form of a four-paragraph letter from Trump’s longtime physician Harold Bornstein. The doctor said he only spent five minutes on Trump’s letter, which lacked objective details despite proclaiming the candidate’s health to be “astonishingly excellent.”Trump has been even less revealing when it comes to releasing his tax returns. He’s broken with a four-decade tradition by refusing to disclose them, even amid serious questions about his business ties and charitable contributions. Trump gave journalists several different excuses over the past year for why he wasn’t releasing his returns, eventually saying he couldn’t because he’s under audit. Even if under audit, there’s nothing legally prohibiting Trump from disclosing his records. Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, 68, by comparison, has disclosed decades of tax returns and has also been more forthcoming than Trump when it comes to providing medical information. Neither Trump nor Clinton have gone as far in releasing medical details as Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who was 71 while running for president in 2008 and faced questions about his health. But Clinton released a more detailed two-page letter last year from her doctor stating she was in “excellent physical condition and fit to serve as president of the United States.”Hours after Trump appeared on Dr. Oz’s show, the Clinton campaign disseminated a new letter from her doctor covering a recent bout of pneumonia that caused her to nearly faint Sunday and sidelined her from the campaign trail for a few days. The campaign released the information publicly rather than having the candidate brandish it before a celebrity doctor. "
2,POLITICS,This Letter From Louisiana Prosecutors Perfectly Explains Why Criminal Justice Reform Is So Hard,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/criminal-justice-reform_us_57d87019e4b0aa4b722d3af0,The state wants to save money by locking up fewer nonviolent offenders.

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d8728c1800006c32bd13a5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Louisiana can lower its staggering incarceration rate — and save taxpayers money — by locking up fewer nonviolent offenders and devoting more resources to people who are actually dangerous, the state’s legislative auditor argued in a report last week. The auditors’ suggestions are fairly standard: Politicians and activists on both sides of the aisle, from the Koch brothers to #Cut50, support fiscally conservative reforms that will lower the prison population. That’s what makes a response letter from the Louisiana District Attorneys Association, included in the report’s appendix, so revealing. Although the group says it “generally” finds the auditor’s report “thoughtful” and the recommendations “worthy of serious consideration,” it goes on to push back against many of the auditor’s proposals. Sentencing some non-violent offenders to probation or community service “sounds reasonable on paper” but could actually constitute “a significant risk to public safety,” the group claims. Nonviolent criminals in Louisiana should be locked up not just because of their convictions, the DAs argued, but also because they’ve been arrested a lot.The DAs’ argument exposes a little-known obstacle to lowering prison populations: DAs and judges regularly use arrest records in determining how to charge and sentence people, regardless of whether those arrests resulted in convictions. If you were arrested for any crime in the past — even if you weren’t convicted — you can possibly face a longer sentence.This policy has horrific consequences for black communities. Black people are disproportionately subject to arrest in the state of Louisiana, according to a 2014 investigation by USA Today. They also make up the majority of the state’s prison population.Police in Gretna, which sits right across the river from New Orleans, arrest more people per capita than any other department in the U.S. Most of those apprehended are black. The same is true in Baton Rouge, where 284.3 out of 1,000 black residents are arrested, compared to 104.8 out of 1,000 for every other racial group combined, according to USA Today’s analysis. In Jefferson Parish, that number is 94.2 for black residents and 25.2 for everyone else.But many arrests do not result in convictions, as the Center For American Progress noted in a 2014 report.District attorneys and judges in Louisiana give prior arrests particularly heavy weight when considering charges and sentencing, says Derwyn Bunton, the chief district defender for Orleans Parish. The DAs’ desire to continue using nonviolent arrests that didn’t result in convictions as a justification for locking people up shows that Louisiana’s justice system is “wed to over-incarceration” and “points to how difficult criminal justice reform can be,” he added. “The larger the criminal justice system is, the more DAs we need to prosecute crimes and keep our communities safe. A larger criminal justice system ― one which criminalizes more and more conduct ― allows DA offices to justify budget increases and a need for more resources,” Bunton said. “They are a very active co-conspirator in mass incarceration in Louisiana. It is not all district attorneys, by any means, but generally as an organization, the culpability of our district attorneys in the mass incarceration problem is quite high.”The DAs stand by their argument.“If a person has an arrest record of 10 or 15 felony arrests and for purpose ― like intimidating witnesses or killing witnesses ― but there is no conviction, I believe it’s very relevant to the judge and the district attorney to judge how to proceed with that defendant,” said E. Pete Adams, the group’s executive director. Prosecutors “seem reluctant to let go of long-term Louisiana traditions favoring incarceration and relying on arrest records as a primary source for sentencing data ― even to the extent of giving them more importance than the offense of conviction,” said G. Paul Marx, the chief district defender for Lafayette Parish.Using arrest records to determine sentences is especially problematic in the context of Louisiana’s extremely harsh habitual offender laws, Bunton said. In 2012, Louisiana had around 160 people serving 20 years or more “whose most recent crime involved nothing more harmful than marijuana,” according to an investigation by The Times-Picayune. There were also over 300 inmates serving life without parole who were never convicted of a violent crime.The costs of housing and feeding these nonviolent offenders adds up. As the report notes, the state spent approximately $680.4 million in fiscal year 2015 keeping people behind bars.“Our money would be better spent on people who have a demonstrated history of really going upside somebody’s head,” Bunton said. “But it is the philosophy of many in our district attorneys’ association ― and the association as a whole ― that it’s OK to lock up people with those kinds of criminal histories, mostly because where there’s smoke there’s fire.” Read the entire report below:  "
3,POLITICS,It's Time For Colin Powell To Make His Presidential Preferences Known,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colin-powell-2016-race_us_57d9759be4b09d7a6880dfb7,"Based on what he's said in the past, his decision should be clear.",2016-09-14,When will retired Army Gen. Colin Powell reveal his presidential pick?,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_0_56_3149_1815%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Over the past year, retired Army Gen. Colin Powell ― like many other conservative elites ― has been reluctant to be much more than a fence-sitter in the 2016 presidential race. The Huffington Post’s Michelle Fields reported toward the end of July that as attention was being turned toward the political conventions, Powell was a portrait of reticence ― even as prods to play an influential role came from both directions. But this week, Powell has been dragged into the spotlight all the same, after ― what else? ― a cache of hacked emails were publicly leaked.So, his days as a fence-sitter could be numbered. But while it may be enlightening to know which of the two major party’s candidates Powell prefers, we are waiting for an even more interesting revelation: Is Colin Powell still guided by the same principles that have governed his previous endorsements? It’s an open question.The content of Powell’s leaked emails ― which have been confirmed as authentic ― can be easily caricatured. In many ways, Powell is an example of that Everyman voter that media outlets love to use as a broad characterization of the electorate, unenthusiastic about the major party candidates and unhappy with the need to choose. It’s like a photo-negative of where Powell was in 2008, when he could offer both Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) equal heaps of praise, and yet come to a clear decision about whom he wanted to support.Prior to this year’s conventions, Powell had criticized the cornerstone of Trump’s policy proposals ― the deportation of all undocumented immigrants ― telling the audience at the Washington Ideas Forum, “If I was around Mr. Trump, Donald, who I know rather well, I would say, ‘You know Don, let’s see what happens. Let’s tell all the immigrants working in Trump hotels to stay home tomorrow. See what happens.’” But Powell’s leaked emails don’t suggest the general would like to be “around Donald Trump” to offer his point of view. In them, he describes Trump as “a national disgrace and an international pariah.” He’s also unsparing about Trump’s views on race, writing that “there is nothing he can say” to black voters that would bring them to his side. “He takes us for idiots,” Powell writes. “He can never overcome what he tried to do to Obama with his search for the birth certificate ... the whole birther movement was racist.” Elsewhere, Powell notes that Trump “appeals to the worst angels of the GOP nature and poor white folks” and “has no sense of shame.”But if Powell’s criticisms of Trump are broad and severe, what he has to say about Clinton ― while less scathing ― seems more personal. As The Huffington Post’s Paul Blumenthal notes, in one, Powell is aggrieved that Clinton’s large speakers fee diminished his own opportunities in the same arena:“Everything HRC touches she kind of screws up with hubris,” Powell wrote in an email to private equity investor Jeffrey Leeds. “I told you about the gig I lost at a University because she so overcharged them they came under heat and couldn’t any fees for awhile. I should send her the bill.”But more broadly, Powell is not pleased with the way he’s been tied to Clinton’s personal email account. Dogged by the story throughout the election cycle, Clinton has frequently opted to use Powell as her easy out ― characterizing her decision to use a private server as informed by advice from her State Department predecessor.Clinton’s defenders point to an email she received from Powell, in which he discusses having set up the means to “communicate with a wide range of friends directly without it going through the State Department on their personal email accounts.” Powell has pushed back on this characterization throughout (and fact checkers have found the analogy wanting). That pushback continues in these leaked emails as well:“Sad thing it [sic] that HRC could have killed this two years ago by merely telling everyone honestly what she had done and not tie me into it,” Powell said in one email. He wrote that he “told her staff three times not to try that gambit.”There is a certain element of tone-deafness to the Clinton campaign’s attempts to deploy Powell as their bulwark against further criticism of the choices she made with regard to her emails. After all, Clinton spent a good portion of the post-convention period wooing just about every other Bush-era foreign policy figure, angling for their endorsement. Needlessly getting Powell’s back up over decisions that she alone made wasn’t exactly the best way to secure his support ― especially when you consider that Powell’s support may have been larger looming.After all, Powell’s endorsement of Obama back in 2008 was freighted with significance, partly because the retired general remains a revered figure among media elites. When he decided to make his endorsement that year, he did so in a special segment of “Meet the Press,” in a conversation with Tom Brokaw that was more focused on pomp than probing. During that segment, Powell offered that the next president needed to “[convey] a new image of American leadership, a new image of America’s role in the world.” A more on-his-game Brokaw might have interjected at this point, pointing out that this “new image” was necessitated by the one left by President George W. Bush, whom Powell had served.Of course, what this reveals is that Powell’s endorsement of Obama was at least partially undertaken as a way to rehabilitate Powell’s own image. But if you’re wondering how Powell might actually be leaning, between a former secretary of state who’s shown “hubris” and a reality television performer who is a “national disgrace,” we should consider another part of that “Meet the Press” segment, in which Powell reveals what inspired him to pick Obama over McCain:POWELL: I’m also troubled by, not what Senator McCain says, but what members of the party say. And it is permitted to be said such things as, “Well, you know that Mr. Obama is a Muslim.” Well, the correct answer is, he is not a Muslim, he’s a Christian. He’s always been a Christian. But the really right answer is, what if he is? Is there something wrong with being a Muslim in this country? The answer’s no, that’s not America. Is there something wrong with some seven-year-old Muslim-American kid believing that he or she could be president? Yet, I have heard senior members of my own party drop the suggestion, “He’s a Muslim and he might be associated terrorists.” This is not the way we should be doing it in America.There are some obvious, more current echoes to the grotesque Islamophobia Powell saw back then, and the leaked emails indicate Powell has noticed them in Trump. “When Trump couldn’t keep [birtherism] up he said he also wanted to see if the certificate noted he was a Muslim ... As I have said before, ‘What if he was?’ Muslims are born as Americans everyday.”So, one has to wonder if Powell has the desire to return to these past reflections, which he experienced when the standard-bearer of his party was not a flamboyant anti-Islamic bigot ― it was just a bewildering and troubling atmospheric condition in his party. Now that Powell can no longer separate the Republican presidential candidate from the creeping stench of Islamophobia, how can his zeal for “what we should not be doing in America” have faded?As it happens, Powell has never been quick to offer endorsements. In the past two presidential election cycles, he’s held out until October before finally making his preferences known. So far, none of the attention paid to his leaked emails has prompted him to move up his timeline ― if anything, they’ve only fueled speculation that he may never move from the fence. Nevertheless, the only person who can clear up whether Powell is going to follow his conscience down the same path that led him to make a break with his party in 2008 is Powell. And so, we wait.Jason Linkins edits “Eat The Press” for The Huffington Post and co-hosts the HuffPost Politics podcast “So, That Happened.” Subscribe here, and listen to the latest episode below."
4,POLITICS,Melania Trump Photographer Backs Up Her Immigration Claims,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/melania-trump-immigration-photographer_us_57d9bd09e4b04a1497b24b62,His past comments prompted questions about whether she once worked in the U.S. illegally.,2016-09-14,"Melania Trump, wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, says she came to the U.S. for the first time in 1996.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d9c17c1800006c32bd17a5.jpeg?cache=NG2Oi3eWdd&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Alé de Basse­ville, the photographer whose July comments led to questions over whether Melania Trump lied about her immigration history, is now backing up the timeline the GOP nominee’s wife has offered regarding when she started working in the United States. The former model again denied allegations on Wednesday that she worked in New York City in 1995, which would have been illegal if she did not receive work authorization until the following year. The allegations were prompted, in part, by the New York Post publishing photos from the now-defunct French magazine Max ― and de Basse­ville saying the photos had been taken in Manhattan in 1995 and published in January 1996. But de Basse­ville told the New York Post on Wednesday that he misspoke.“[T]he photo session actually took place in 1996 in Manhattan, and appeared in a 1997 issue of the magazine,” a spokeswoman for the newspaper said he told the publication. The Post has since updated its piece. De Basseville’s clarification gives some credibility to Melania’s claims that her immigration record has been misreported. The issue over her early immigration status first erupted in August, when Politico reported the discrepancies between her story and other published reports. Critics quickly noted that her husband, Donald Trump, has been hypercritical of both unauthorized workers and even legal immigrants using H-1B visas, as his wife says she did.Melania posted to Twitter a letter from her attorney, Michael J. Wildes, on Wednesday. Wildes writes that Melania “never worked in the United States in 1995 because she was was never in the United States in 1995” (emphasis his). She first entered the U.S. on Aug. 27, 1996, on a visitor visa and received a work visa on Oct. 18 of that year, he said.The Trump campaign did not produce any documentation of Melania’s immigration record, and there are still discrepancies between the letter and past reports and remarks. A recent biography of Melania published by Slovenian journalists also says she came to the U.S. in 1995, according to Politico. Melania has said she left the country “every few months” to get her visa stamped before she became a legal permanent resident ― which contradicts her latest statement that she received five one-year H-1B visas to work between 1996 and 2001.

Finally, in March — after years of boycotts and impending legal pressure — SeaWorld announced that it would end its orca breeding program as well as the theatrical shows that had featured its killer whales.Now, California is hammering the nail into the coffin. Gov. Jerry Brown signed legislation this week that will outlaw orca breeding and captivity programs in the state. The new law, which Assemblyman Richard Bloom (D-Santa Monica) authored, will also ban California parks from featuring orcas in performances for entertainment purposes. Starting in June 2017, killer whales in captivity can only be used for “educational presentations,” the Los Angeles Times reports. The legislation makes other exceptions for scientific and educational institutions that have orcas in their care. SeaWorld said earlier this year that it planned to “fundamentally change” its business model, not just ending its orca breeding program but also stopping theatrical shows at its parks in San Diego, California, San Antonio, Texas, and Orlando, Florida.The marine park said it would instead focus on education programs, and animal rescue and rehabilitation.Though activists have pressed SeaWorld to free their captive orcas, it’s believed the animals will live out the remainder of their lives there.“A lot of people just don’t realize that without facilities like SeaWorld, there are no places for these creatures to go,” said CEO Joel Manby in March, adding that the company cares for many sick and injured animals as part of its conservation initiative.There are more than 50 orcas held in captivity in several U.S. states and at least eight countries worldwide, according to the Whale and Dolphin Conservation. SeaWorld’s parks are home to more than 20 of them. "

7,BUSINESS,Workplace Health Insurance Premiums Finally Stopped Skyrocketing. Now For The Bad News.,Jeffrey Young,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/health-insurance-costs-2016_us_57d81823e4b0fbd4b7bb75b2,"Deductibles keep getting bigger, and costs are still growing faster than paychecks.",2016-09-14,This is the story for the more than 150 million Americans who get their health insurance through employers.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d818831300002a0039bb2e.jpeg?cache=7NdzetJ3FP&ops=crop_0_31_3203_1828%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Employers that provide health insurance, who cover nearly half of all Americans, saw modest premium increases this year, which is good news. But wait until you see the rest of the findings of a new survey.The average annual cost of an employer-sponsored family plan rose just 3 percent to $18,142 this year, and the average annual cost for an individual plan stayed virtually the same at $6,435. Those figures, which combine the amounts that employees and employers pay, come from the survey published Wednesday by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust and from an article appearing in the journal Health Affairs.In the messy, expensive U.S. health care system, such small increases constitute a positive development.The National Business Group on Health previously reported that companies expect just small premium increases next year, too. And all this is happening during a period of lower-than-normal growth in overall health care spending.But beneath those top-line figures are some not-so-positive developments, like a continuing trend toward workers facing higher and higher deductibles they must meet before their benefits kick in and having to pick up a larger share of the premium costs while employers kick in less and less.The following charts from the Kaiser Family Foundation/HRET report show just how much more expensive and less generous Americans’ job-based health benefits have become over time.A family plan cost workers about $1,500 in 1999, $4,000 in 2010 and $5,300 this year, while their employers’ percentage share of the total premium has been creeping downward.Even more striking is this graph, which shows how job-based health insurance costs have dramatically outpaced incomes and economic growth (as measured by inflation) over that same time period. And that continues despite relatively slow premium growth over the past five years.These next two graphs show that the value of health care coverage has declined even as premiums rose: A growing share of workers are enrolled in plans with high deductibles, and the deductibles themselves are increasing. As a result, employees are shouldering more of the costs of their health care over time.This is happening because health care keeps getting more expensive ― a trend that began long before the Affordable Care Act was enacted. Higher costs are the main driver of rising premiums and larger deductibles.But the employer insurance market isn’t struggling with other problems that plague the Obamacare market. Perhaps most importantly, the employer market covers a sustainable mix of healthy and sick customers, unlike the Affordable Care Act exchanges.All the attention lately on Obamacare’s challenges makes it easy to forget that most Americans don’t get their health coverage that way. Despite a widespread public misconception, none of its issues affect health care costs and benefits for the vast majority of people.Jobs are the biggest source of health benefits, and the more than 150 million people who are covered by employer-sponsored health plans dwarfs the 22 million who use an exchange or buy plans directly from insurers. Another 68 million are enrolled in Medicaid and 55 million use Medicare.The Affordable Care Act left the employer market for health insurance mostly untouched. Even provisions of the 2010 law directed at employers ― such as the requirement that companies with at least 50 full-time workers offer health benefits ― have had minimal effect overall to date. The main reason: most employers, and nearly all large businesses, already provided health benefits that met the standards of the law ― and plan to continue doing so, as the new survey shows."

The children, who fled war and poverty, are stranded in camps and refugee centers all across Greece, where opportunities for learning have been limited.But the ministry’s decision to help them gain access to formal education has already been met with resistance. Two parents associations in Oreokastro, a town on the outskirts of Thessaloniki in northern Greece, have issued statements saying they will not accept the 420 migrant and refugee children living in the area in their schools.The two associations, for the 1st primary school of Paleokastro and 5th primary school of Oreokastro, said their decision was “unanimous” and threatened to occupy school premises to oppose the children’s entry.HuffPost Greece contacted the parents associations to find out the reasoning behind their opposition.Fotini Kitsiou, president of the Paleokastro school’s parents association, claimed the parents were primarily concerned about health: “These children have not been vaccinated and we are worried about diseases.” If refugee children met health and vaccination standards, she added, the parents would not have a problem with them attending school.But she also mentioned cultural and religious differences as a reason for the parents’ opposition, saying, “These children are raised in a different way and they wouldn’t feel comfortable in our schools.”Oreokastro Mayor Asterios Gavotsis said he believed the best solution would be for refugee children to attend classes in a separate location. If the government does not agree with the proposals Oreokastro residents have submitted, he warned, they will mobilize in protest.Not everyone in town stands behind the two parents associations, however. Athanasios Tsolakidis, the president of the Union of Parents Associations of Oreokastro, told HuffPost Greece the two parents associations were “two isolated cases” and said their views do not resonate with the majority of parents associations in the area. Tsolakidis later resigned, citing attacks from the public.Education Minister Nikos Filis said the groups’ opposition to admitting refugee children is “incomprehensible” and attributed it to lack of information and prejudice. “This attitude stands completely at odds with the love, solidarity and understanding that the great majority of Greek parents, students and teachers have shown [towards refugees] in our country,” he said.According to Filis, the government’s integration plan already addresses health concerns and includes an immunization program. “We have taken all necessary measures,” he affirmed in a radio interview. “Refugee children will be received at schools, will be vaccinated and will have their teachers. We want them to play with the Greek children and they will gradually be introduced in classrooms. I don’t understand why parents would not accept these children at school.”Meanwhile, the prosecutor’s office in Thessaloniki ordered an investigation on Wednesday into the two parents associations’ stance and the mayor of Oreokastro’s statements to determine whether their actions can be prosecuted under a law that prohibits hate speech and the incitement of racist violence.A version of this story originally appeared on HuffPost Greece."

They were allegedly aware of the teenager’s radicalized activity, according to BFMTV. He was filed under the “S” category, meaning that he was being monitored by the state.It’s work that “is keeping us busy night and day,” interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said on Wednesday. “Our investigation work is more intense than it’s ever been given the heightened threat level and the calls, coming from various players based in Syria who communicate via encrypted messaging, for French people to carry out attacks.”There are about 20,000 people who fall under the “S” category in France, roughly 10,000 of whom have shown ties to radical Islam.The cases of all three minors are connected. They all used Telegram, an encrypted messaging service, to receive guidance on attack planning. They’d also all been in contact with Rachid Kassim, a French jihadi well known to authorities. Kassim is suspected of having mentored the boys via social media from somewhere inside a part of Syria or Iraq controlled by the so-called Islamic State, HuffPost France reported.Kassim was allegedly linked to the car full of explosives placed in central Paris by female commandos on Friday. He is also believed to have been involved in the murder of two French police officers in June and a priest in July. “Women and sisters are executing attacks. So where are the brothers? … If these women are ready to act, it’s because there are too few men who are ready to act,” Kassim said in a Telegram message quoted by Le Monde.Authorities across Western Europe are being kept busy staving off attacks, a mission of unprecedented importance given the recent terror attacks in Paris, Nice and Brussels. German police arrested three Syrian young men on Tuesday suspected of being instructed by ISIS to carry out an attack.The trio arrived in late 2015, likely thanks to the same smuggler network that funneled militants into Paris to carry out November’s attacks, according to interior minister Thomas de Maiziere."

Aleppo residents told The WorldPost they don’t want to get their hopes up as they don’t know what sort of goods to expect, even if the promised aid eventually shows up.

The Jews of Calcutta are one of them.As the capital of British India in the late 1800s and early 1900s, Calcutta in eastern India was once a migrant hub. Communities such as the Parsis, Armenians, Burmese, Chinese, Greeks, and Jews settled there to establish trade and escape their respective wars and displacement. In the early 19th century, it became home to Baghdadi Jews, who comprised one of the Middle East’s most significant Jewish populations until they began to travel as merchants during the 16 century. But after India’s independence from Britain in 1947, nearly all of the 6,000-odd populace re-emigrated west or re-settled in the newly formed Israel.Today, only about 20 Jewish descendants of the original Baghdadi Jews remain in Kolkata (as it was renamed in 2001 in recognition of its Bengali moniker). The city’s Jewish Community Affairs body has stopped counting the number of Jews who call the city home, and nearly all of them have aged into their seventies. This has prompted fears that the Jews of Calcutta will soon be history.But there is one thing that may be able to preserve the legacy of this unique community: food.A new restaurant, Calcutta Stories, aims to draw attention to Kolkata’s Jewish heritage. Calcutta Stories is trying to pique the city’s interest in the migrant cuisines of Kolkata’s roots, including Jewish, Parsi, and Armenian Indo-fusions. It is owned by Prithvish and Baishali Chakravarti, who launched the traditional Kolkata-Chinese eatery Tak Heng last year. The Jewish section of the menu was crafted by 86-year-old Flower Silliman, who has been chronicling Jewish-Calcuttan cuisine through cookbooks in a bid to preserve an essential part of the community’s culture.Silliman was born in Calcutta, where she lived for about half her life before moving to Israel and, later, to the US to live with her children. “My mother wasn’t a good cook, but my grandmother was,” Silliman says of her younger days in Calcutta. “She was incredibly inventive. For instance, she used to make a delicious jam with the pith of pomelos, and even though the fruit is bitter, the jam wasn’t. It was her way of combining the cooking techniques of the Middle East—she was from Basra—with what was available in India.”Over time, Middle Eastern culinary traditions began to merge with Indian ones, creating a unique flavor profile. The most popular Jewish-Calcuttan dish within the Jewish community is probably alu makallah. “I always say this dish came about because two Bengali and Jewish housewives were neighbors,” Silliman says.Believed to have been inspired by the chopped fried potatoes that are indispensable throughout West Bengal, the state of which Kolkata is now capital, alu makallah is made by peeling whole potatoes, pricking them all over with a fork, and deep-frying them in oil with salt and turmeric. The outside turns crisp and brown, while the inside is soft and delicious. They’re best eaten by hand, because they tend to jump off plates if you try to cut them with a knife and fork.The gradual fusion of Bengali and Jewish cuisines over the centuries included assimilating Judaism’s strict dietary laws with Indian culinary techniques. Having trained as a nutritionist, Silliman’s interest and expertise in Indian food led her to open the world’s first kosher non-vegetarian Indian restaurant, Maharaja, in Israel in the 1970s. “At the time, Israelis were starved for information about India,” she says. Silliman hired a cook from India and decorated the restaurant with classical paintings to make it as authentically Indian as possible, and ran it successfully for around eight years.Silliman retained the “Indian-ness” of the food at Maharaja without combining it with local flavors, but at Calcutta Stories, she has reflected the marriage of Middle Eastern and Indian cuisines. Jewish food was blander and lighter in the deserts of the Middle East, but it became spicier and fuller when the Baghdadi Jews came to India.New ingredients and access to fresh greens made unique interpretations of standard dishes possible. For example, Jewish households in Kolkata added fresh ginger—which isn’t available in the desert—to hilbeh, a green chutney traditionally prepared with fenugreek seeds, garlic, lemon juice, coriander, and green chilies. Some versions also added mint leaves and/or parsley.Living between these two cultures didn’t just mean applying different cooking techniques to foreign vegetables—it also meant finding ways around Jewish food preparation laws in a non-kosher country. Ian Zachariah, a 73-year-old food writer who works with Jewish Community Affairs, grew up in the only Jewish family in Jamshedpur, a city 290kms (180 miles) away from Kolkata. Since Jews make up only a small minority in India, kosher rules were tough to follow. “Our cook used to slaughter the meat because no one knew the kosher way,” he says.When he moved to Calcutta over 50 years ago, kosher meat was easier to find because of the larger Jewish community. But as the number of Jews in the city shrank, they had to adapt. One alternative was to go to a halal butcher, because the method of slaughter as per Islamic and Jewish dietary laws is very similar. The meat would then be salted for an hour to draw out all the blood before it was cooked.Other Jewish culinary rules were easier to adhere to, such as not mixing dairy products with meat. Coconut milk became a valuable substitute for dairy. Freshwater fish was a staple in every household, thanks to the abundant lakes and rivers in the state. A common stew was made by flaking fried fish into boiling coconut milk with fresh coriander and chilies. Tamarind also began to appear in some traditionally Jewish dishes, such as chitanee, which is a sweet-and-sour chicken preparation.Until now, the new generations of Kolkata have only known of the city’s Jewish legacy through oral history.

Job-related dissatisfaction experienced in your 20s and 30s can lead to overall health issues just 10 or 20 years down the line, according to a new study from the American Sociological Association.“We found that there is a cumulative effect of job satisfaction on health that appears as early as your 40s,” said lead author Jonathan Dirlam, a doctoral student in sociology at Ohio State University. Dirlam and his team analyzed data from over 6,000 participants in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, which has been tracking outcomes of participants since 1979. The researchers examined the participants’ job satisfaction trajectories from age 25 to 39, and then compared that data with the health conditions reported by the same participants after they turned 40.What they discovered was people who were unhappier in their jobs early in their careers were also the most prone to illness, particularly mental health problems, in their 40s. They were more depressed, had more emotional issues and sleep problems and suffered from excessive worry.Physical ailments were also more likely, though to a lesser degree. Those with lower job satisfaction tended to report more problems like back pain and frequent colds than those who were happier at work.“We found that those with lower job satisfaction levels throughout their late 20s and 30s have worse mental health compared to those with high job satisfaction levels,” Dirlam told CBS News. “Those who initially had high job satisfaction but downwardly decreased over time also had worse health.” Co-author Hui Zheng, an associate professor of sociology at Ohio State, said the findings reveal the importance that early jobs have on people’s lives and well-being. “You don’t have to be near the end of your career to see the health impact of job satisfaction, particularly on your mental health,” he said.Zheng added that though researchers found little difference in other health problems like cancer and diabetes, those issues might be expected later in life among those with lower job satisfaction levels.“The higher levels of mental health problems for those with low job satisfaction may be a precursor to future physical problems,” he said. “Increased anxiety and depression could lead to cardiovascular or other health problems that won’t show up until they are older.”The study, presented on Aug. 22 at an annual meeting of the ASA, supports earlier research that suggests a clear correlation between job satisfaction and health.In a 2003 meta-analysis of 485 studies on the subject, job satisfaction was found to be strongly associated with psychological problems such as burnout, depression and anxiety. A modest link between job happiness and physical illness was also found.Job satisfaction is “an important factor influencing the health of workers,” the authors of the analysis concluded.“Organizations should include the development of stress management policies to identify and eradicate work practices that cause most job dissatisfaction as part of any exercise aimed at improving employee health,” the authors advised. “Occupational health clinicians should consider counselling employees diagnosed as having psychological problems to critically evaluate their work— and help them to explore ways of gaining greater satisfaction from this important aspect of their life.” "

She was treated with Levaquin, an antibiotic, and advised to take it for 10 days. “She is recovering well with antibiotics and rest. She continues to remain healthy and fit to serve as President of the United States,” said Clinton’s physician, Dr. Lisa Bardack.Bardack characterized Clinton’s last physical as “normal” and said the Democratic nominee “is in excellent mental condition.”“My overall impression is that Mrs. Clinton has remained healthy and has not developed new medical conditions this year other than a sinus and ear infection and her recently diagnosed pneumonia,” the doctor’s letter said.The campaign also released the medical details of Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Clinton’s vice presidential running mate. His doctor said he is in “overall excellent health.” He works out three times a week, takes no medications, has no history of tobacco use and drinks alcohol in “modest” amounts, it notes.The release comes on the same day that Republican nominee Donald Trump shared some details about his own health with Dr. Mehmet Oz, on Oz’s eponymous TV show. Trump revealed that he weighs 267 pounds, takes medication to manage his cholesterol and gets annual cancer screenings. Trump has not, however, released the same depth of medical details. Until now, the only information on his health was a letter from his longtime physician, Dr. Harold Bornstein, in which he said the nominee’s health was “astonishingly excellent.” Bornstein later said the letter took him only five minutes to write. Clinton’s medical details come as her campaign seeks to deflect criticism from both allies and opponents over its decision to withhold the news that Clinton had been diagnosed with pneumonia last Friday.When the Democratic nominee stumbled leaving an event honoring the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York on Sunday, her campaign initially blamed the heat, saying Clinton had become “overheated.” It was not until hours later that Clinton’s campaign released a statement from Bardack revealing the pneumonia diagnosis. Clinton spent the first part of this week recuperating at her home in Chappaqua, New York, while her husband, former President Bill Clinton, filled in for her at campaign events. According to Clinton’s campaign, the nominee plans to return to the campaign trail Thursday. Trump and his supporters have been questioning Clinton’s health for months. (Clinton is actually two years younger than the GOP presidential nominee.) He has called her “low energy” and said she likes to take naps. And last week, conservative media made hay out of Clinton’s coughing spells. This post has been updated with information on the release of Kaine’s medical information.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

And, for many, it’s nice to see some ladies dominating the country music scene. Ballerini remembers it was a bit of a different story just a couple of years ago.“It was really hard for females at that time,” she told The Huffington Post, recalling a lot of talk around men taking prominent spots on country radio and elsewhere in the music world.“It was just this constant conversation happening in Nashville. And I remember it was talked about everywhere, like, ‘Where are the girls on country radio other than Carrie [Underwood] and Miranda [Lambert]?’ I think, like everything, it was a trend,” the 23-year-old explained. “They called it bro country … and I don’t think there was anything wrong with that. It’s really cool when in every genre of music you can listen to a song and know what era it was from. I think that bro country became kind of an era for country music, and I like that there’s a new era and it’s women. It’s Maren [Morris], It’s Maddie & Tae.”You can also add Ballerini to that growing list of female singers taking over the country music scene. Also a songwriter, Ballerini co-wrote “Peter Pan,” about heartbreak and past relationships. “I try to be as honest as I can in writing. That’s what ends up translating and relating to people,” she said. “It’s so fun to make up stories, but I find that the songs that I’m most proud of came from a real thing in my life. ‘Peter Pan’ being one of those.”Writing comes naturally for Ballerini, who says she always loved music and grew up singing in church choir and glee club. She just wasn’t sure how to go about pursuing her passion. “I was living in Knoxville, Tennessee, and I didn’t really know how you would become a singer. I didn’t even think that I could do it. I didn’t even dream about it. But when I was 12, it was that year where I got tall, boys got cute, everything was weird,” she said. “Then my parents split up on top of that, so it was a big year of change for me. I just randomly started writing songs. It honestly just fell into my lap. It became an obsession.”And luckily others have caught on, including Taylor Swift. The country-turned-pop superstar actually helped push Ballerini’s career along.“Taylor tweeted about my EP two years ago … No one knew who I was. And she randomly heard ‘Love Me’ when she was in Nashville and tweeted about it and completely changed the course of my life. We just started talking from there and now we’re buddies. She’s awesome.” Ballerini says she looks to people like Swift for advice on navigating the music industry, touring and more. Coming up, Ballerini, who’s opened up for the likes of Lady Antebellum and Rascal Flatts, will mark her first major headlining tour this fall. She’s also plotting a full-length sophomore album. “We’re four songs in right now. I’m still figuring out what the heartbeat of it’s going to be,” she said. “But what we have so far I’m really proud of.”The Huffington Post receives a percentage from the purchase of tickets bought via a link on this page."

I am also blind. How do I reconcile these two seemingly contrary notions?That’s a question I’m asked often, along with, “How do you use knives without cutting yourself? Do you ever burn your hands? How do you know when something’s done cooking? Has your sense of taste heightened since you no longer have your sight?”Sighted people are fascinated by my methodology in the kitchen. They watch with wide eyes (or so I’m told) whenever I give a cooking demonstration. They applaud with awe, as though I’d just pulled a rabbit out of a hat. “You’re amazing,” they say to me afterwards as I clumsily fumble for their outstretched hand.“Thank you,” I say, meeting their palm, truly appreciative of the praise. But honestly, I don’t feel very amazing.Cooking is something I just do. It’s as much a part of me as my penchant for prose and my disdain for soggy sandwiches. Slicing shallots and searing pork skin are routine, things I do day in and day out, much like my morning coffee and bedtime flossing habits. Sure, I have to do things a little differently nowadays. I pay more attention to what I hear, smell, feel and taste when I work my way through a dish.Simply by scent, I know when garlic has gone from raw to just right and then quickly to burnt. Feeling the flesh tells me if the pork is uncooked, still too tough, or perfectly tender. There are raised bump dots pasted on my stove knobs, marking the various heat levels from simmer to ripping hot. And as a nod to the technique by which all Asians were taught to measure water for rice, I use the knuckles on my fingers to determine the volume of coconut juice in a cup.When people ask me how I cook without sight, I say I’ve just learned to adapt. We humans are much more resilient than we think. Our bodies heal, and even when they don’t, we find a way to compensate. I’m almost certain if you were to lose your vision like me, you’d learn how to keep living life with abandon, doing the things you do without apology.I cook because it’s what I love to do, because it’s a meditation on memory. When I braise pork belly in this sweet and savory sauce, I am recreating the past, and this privilege—to be able to share my story with you—is what I find truly amazing."
26,POLITICS,Supreme Court Won't Rescue 'Golden Week' Of Early Voting In Ohio,Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ohio-early-voting-supreme-court_us_57d715a6e4b0aa4b722bef0a,Ohio Democrats wanted the court to reinstate a six-day period that allowed voters to register and vote at the same time.,2016-09-13,"Some cutbacks to early voting in Ohio have been subject to a flurry of legal challenges, and the Supreme Court has largely sided with the state.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57d723131800006c32bd0f3a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The Supreme Court on Tuesday turned away an effort by Ohio Democratic groups that sought to restore a special week that allowed voters to register and vote early on the same day.In a brief order, the justices denied the groups’ request but did not note where they stood in the dispute. At least five of them are needed to grant an emergency petition.Without this six-day period, known as “Golden Week,” Ohio voters now have four weeks to vote early, beginning on Oct. 12 ― either in person or via absentee ballot.State lawmakers eliminated Golden Week in 2014, leading to legal challenges alleging discrimination against minority voters. An early lawsuit couldn’t stop cutbacks for the 2014 election ― and the Supreme Court at the time agreed to let Ohio officials move forward with the shorter early-voting period. But following a new round of litigation, a federal judge in May concluded that eliminating Golden Week was an unconstitutional burden on black voters.“Indeed, it may be more difficult for voters with time, resource, transportation, and childcare restraints to make two separate trips to register and vote, and Golden Week allowed individuals to do both at once,” wrote U.S. District Judge Michael Watson in his ruling.An appeals court last month reversed that decision, observing that Ohio, even without the benefit of extra days of early voting and same-day registration, was a “national leader” in providing additional opportunities to vote early.“Ohio continues to provide generous, reasonable, and accessible voting options to all Ohioans,” said the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit. Ohio Democrats contended that the reversal was too close to the formal start of early voting and that it risked creating confusion and long wait times at the polls.Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted (R) said in a statement that he hoped the Supreme Court’s move would mark the end of the road for these legal challenges, which he called “wasteful.”“This much is perfectly clear: Ohio is a place where it is easy to vote and hard to cheat. In fact, with voting now slated to begin in less than a month for the November election, Ohio is one of the easiest states in the nation in which to register and cast your ballot,” Husted said.With Tuesday’s order, the Supreme Court has so far declined to reverse or put on hold every voting rights ruling that could have an impact on Election Day ― including cases involving North Carolina’s restrictive voting law and a Michigan ban to “straight-ticket” voting.Unlike the Ohio case, these last two controversies resulted in net losses for Republicans ― underscoring the ideological divide among the justices when it comes to voting rights, as well as the politics surrounding the replacement for the late Justice Antonin Scalia.In a statement, the Ohio Democratic Party suggested as much.“We’re disappointed in the outcome, but we’re not surprised given the fact that the Supreme Court is hamstrung with only eight justices because of Republican obstructionism,” said David Pepper, the state party chairman.This story has been updated to include a statement from the Ohio Democratic Party."

Donald Trump has made one doctor's note public.,2016-09-13,Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) stands behind Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton at Sunday's ceremony for the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON ― Top House Democrats this week defended how Hillary Clinton has handled being diagnosed with pneumonia, arguing that the candidate faces more intense scrutiny than Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.), who stood next to Clinton during a 9/11 memorial ceremony on Sunday, pushed back when asked at a press conference if the candidate hadn’t been transparent about her health. “All of a sudden it’s about the transparency of Mrs. Clinton,” Crowley said Tuesday. “What about the transparency of Mr. Trump, who refuses once again ― beside his doctor’s note ― he continues to refuse to show any of his tax returns.”Piling on, Crowley pointed to a recent Washington Post report showing that Trump used his foundation to contribute other people’s money to charitable organizations and take the credit.“There’s a double standard for Mrs. Clinton,” Crowley continued. “[Trump] doesn’t have to show anything. He could walk right up to the election and show absolutely nothing, continue to repeat lies. Lie after lie after lie, and he’s not held accountable.”Clinton’s campaign made her pneumonia diagnosis public hours after she stumbled while exiting the memorial ceremony, but critics argued that the former secretary of state hadn’t been transparent about her health because her doctor had issued the diagnosis on Friday. Clinton previously released a summary of her health and plans to make more medical records available, her campaign said this week. A number of top Democrats have come to Clinton’s defense, attempting downplay the severity of her pneumonia. Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) revealed on Monday that he was diagnosed with pneumonia weeks ago and that the illness has passed, The Associated Press reported. Vice President Joe Biden said during a visit to Charlotte, North Carolina, on Monday that he had walking pneumonia last year, according to a pool report. Trump released one note from his doctor in December. In it, gastroenterologist Harold Bornstein said Trump would be “the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.” Bornstein revealed last month that he wrote the note in just five minutes, while a car sent by Trump waited for him outside. Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) conceded that it is fair to ask about Clinton’s health and question the campaign waiting to announce the diagnosis, but added that Trump’s campaign should be treated the same way. “We know less about Donald Trump’s health today than we’ve known about Hillary Clinton’s health for some time,” Becerra said.

They noted that after the donation was received, Bondi declined to pursue a case against Trump’s controversial real estate seminar program or to join other states’ litigation. They also cited other donations in support of Bondi’s bid for re-election.“This fact pattern indicates that these payments may have influenced Mrs. Bondi’s official decision not to participate in litigation against Mr. Trump,” wrote the Democrats, led by Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.). “A number of criminal statutes would appear to be implicated by this course of conduct,” they argued, pointing to laws against bribery, public corruption and hiding charitable foundation payments from the Internal Revenue Service.Trump’s campaign slammed the complaint as a stunt that was meant to take the focus off Hillary Clinton, whose weekend bout with pneumonia has attracted massive press attention.“That is a totally ridiculous and false mischaracterization that blatantly disregards the facts,” said a statement from Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks. “This is clearly a politically motivated attempt to distract from all of Hillary Clinton’s issues.”Nevertheless, foundations are not allowed to make political contributions, and Trump’s foundation did not report the pro-Bondi contribution to the IRS until reporters uncovered it. He has since paid a $2,500 fine. Democrats argue that a fine is insufficient.“Our concerns extend beyond Mr. Trump’s violation of tax laws,” they wrote. “We also note that this allegation ― that Mr. Trump bribed a Florida state official to protect his business interests ― is consistent with Mr. Trump’s own statements about using money to influence politics,” they wrote, referring to a Wall Street Journal interview in which Trump said, “As a businessman and a very substantial donor to very important people, when you give, they do whatever the hell you want them to do.”They also highlighted a quote that Clinton’s campaign featured in a new ad, which also accuses Trump of breaking laws. “I’ve given to everybody. Because that was my job. I gotta give to them. ... Because when I want something, I get it. When I call, they kiss my ass,” Trump said back in January, according to The Washington Post.The Democrats are hardly the only ones asking for such an investigation.Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which is now run by a Clinton ally, is also calling for an investigation. But CREW’s complaint is broader, pointing to a fundraiser that Trump held for Bondi at his Palm Beach mansion that may have been worth $150,000.Another group, the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, has similarly charged that he broke the law.The Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee did not respond to requests for comment.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

And recently Trump changed his tune, saying he’ll release his returns as soon as Hillary Clinton releases the 33,000 emails she deleted from her email server.”“What this means, of course, is that there’s no real reason that Trump is keeping his returns secret, except that he sees them as a bargaining chip to utilize,” he added.In his post, Hoffman told the story of Peter Kiernan, a 26-year-old Marine who’s launched a campaign on the fundraising site Crowdpac. Kiernan hopes to raise at least $25,000 for charities supporting veterans if Trump releases his tax returns by Oct. 19.With Trump’s 2012 offer to Obama in mind, Hoffman said that if Kiernan’s campaign meets or exceeds its fundraising goal, he’ll match the total fivefold. Hoffman said he is prepared to donate up to $5 million. “The ingenuity of Kiernan’s proposal is how it gives Trump a strong incentive to act but doesn’t reward him directly for something he should have already done,” Hoffman wrote at Medium. “Instead, men and women to whom all Americans owe a great debt of gratitude will benefit from any positive action he takes.”Last year, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton released her personal income tax returns spanning eight years ― 2007 through 2014 ― shortly after declaring her candidacy. Her 2015 tax return, which was released last month, showed that she and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, took in $10.6 million last year and paid $3.24 million in taxes.Because of Clinton’s 2008 presidential campaign and her husband’s decades-long political career, the couple’s tax returns are available going back to 1977.If Trump doesn’t make his tax returns publicly available, it will break from a tradition more than 40 years old. Nearly every major presidential candidate since 1973 has released his or her personal returns, with the exception of Gerald Ford, who released a tax summary that covered several years but never made his full returns available.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

The website also reported that Nelly owes his home state of Missouri $149,511 in unpaid taxes, dating back to 2013, which The Huffington Post can confirm. It’s unclear why the 41-year-old has yet to pay his taxes, but it has been more than a decade since the rapper had a No. 1 album, and his last hit in the U.S. was 2010’s “Just a Dream.” Spin had the brilliant idea to help the rapper generate some revenue and capitalize on all the nostalgia surrounding the early aughts right now.According to the site, if everyone bands together and streams Nelly’s 2000 hit “Hot in Herre” 287,176,547 times we can help him with his tax dilemma. (Spotify recently said they pay artists between $0.006 and $0.0084 for each song streamed). It’s a plan that just might work.

The gift will allow the program to operate in perpetuity and expand its work.Rosenthal said in a statement that the Ohio Innocence Project “has a laudable mission” in seeking to free every innocent person in the state.“I’m proud to help ensure its life-saving work continues now and forever,” Rosenthal said. “Thank you to everyone who has helped make the OIP so successful in its mission – I’m inspired daily by the students, faculty and staff who work tirelessly in the pursuit of justice.”Rosenthal’s single gift was roughly triple the amount that the program had raised over the course of more than a decade, and several times its existing endowment, Godsey said. He added that Rosenthal and his late wife, Lois, had been “instrumental” in shaping the organization, which was founded in 2003.One of the people that the Ohio Innocence Project helped clear is Ricky Jackson (pictured above with Rosenthal), who spent 39 years in prison after being sentenced to death row at the age of 18 for a murder he didn’t commit.“The English language doesn’t have the words to express how I’m feeling right now,’’ Jackson said upon his 2014 release.Godsey said there has been increased interest in programs like the Ohio Innocence Project in recent years, in part thanks to shows like “Making a Murderer” and “Serial,” which have helped depict what lawyers working on these cases have known for years.“I think these shows have been tremendously helpful in making the public aware of the problem,” Godsey said. “To be honest with you, I’ve got many cases that are just as interesting and fascinating and crazy as ‘Making a Murderer,’ but nobody was there filming them. When I’d talked about them, the public is in disbelief, because the public is sort of in this fog that the system is nearly perfect and doesn’t need reform. But now when I talk about these cases, they understand the problem and they’re nodding along, and that is extremely helpful.”"

Then in July, it was announced that Oprah would be joining the cast, and Mindy Kaling and Reese Witherspoon were reportedly in talks to join, too. Now, the news is just getting better: “12 Years a Slave” alum Storm Reid will be playing lead Meg Murry, the preteen heroine of the fantasy/sci-fi novel. The 13-year-old actress made her film debut in the 2013 Steve McQueen–directed project, and has also acted in roles for “NCIS” and “Chicago P.D.”The upcoming adaptation marks a milestone for DuVernay: She’ll become the first woman of color to direct a live-action film with a budget upwards of $100 million. According to The Hollywood Reporter, Disney is also looking for a nonwhite actor to play Meg’s friend Calvin, a schoolmate who travels with her and brother Charles to other planets.If you need a refresher in fantasy children’s literature of the 1960s, here’s a brief synopsis: Meg and Charles’ father, a scientist, has gone missing after working on something called a tesseract. After a series of curious happenings, the misfit Meg joins forces with her younger brother and Calvin — a fellow outsider at school — to rescue Mr. Murry from his extraterrestrial exile, with the help of some supernatural neighbors.The themes addressed in L’Engle’s classic are just as relevant today as when they were penned more than half a century ago. Her characters battle with good versus evil, love versus hate, moral responsibility and embracing one’s individuality. The book won the Newbery Medal in 1963, and more recently, Chelsea Clinton named it as an influential book of her childhood during her DNC speech.What makes this news so exciting — aside from getting to see one of our favorite books come back to the big screen — is Disney’s apparent commitment to selecting a diverse cast for this project, for characters who have previously been portrayed as white, and in doing so, presenting a project for viewers that better reflects the diversity of our world.It’s much-welcomed news after this past Oscar year’s #OscarsSoWhite landscape. Giving actresses like Reid leading roles is certainly a celebration for the books."

On early Monday morning ― the beginning of the Eid al-Adha, one of Islam’s holiest holidays ― a man allegedly walked up to a mosque in Florida and set it on fire. And on Monday night, someone repeatedly backed a tractor-trailer into a Maryland mosque. Eid al-Adha is a four-day period of community and celebration, marked by prayer, feasting and gift-giving. But in America this year, it was also marked by fear and sadness. “I’m running out of things to say, really,” an exasperated Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, said on Monday. “Each [incident] is followed by another.”“At this sacred and joyous time for Muslims in the U.S. and around the world, the surge in anti-Muslim attacks is particularly shocking and disheartening,” Nazir Harb, a senior research fellow at Georgetown University’s Bridge Initiative, told The Huffington Post. Muslims in America, Harb said, “began scrambling months ago when it was determined that this year’s Eid holiday would fall on or around the 15th anniversary of the September 11th attacks.”The concern was this: Americans reliving the horrible memories of 9/11 might wrongly perceive public celebrations of Eid as disrespectful, and then lash out against Muslims. But despite a media campaign and a grassroots effort to educate the American public about why Eid was occurring so close to the 9/11 anniversary (answer: the lunar calendar), Harb said that “some of the most gruesome Islamophobic attacks since 9/11 occurred around Eid this week.” “Muslims in this country frequently report potential terrorist incidents and condemn all attacks carried out wrongfully in the name of Islam,” Harb added. “While it is easy, and perhaps comforting, to blame all Muslims for terrorism in the world, such beliefs give rise to violence that hurts innocent, ordinary people.”It’s unclear whether the celebration of Eid had anything to do with this most recent series of vicious Islamophobic crimes. But Islam’s other major holiday, Ramadan, was also marred by anti-Muslim aggression this year. HuffPost documented at least 20 anti-Muslim crimes in the U.S. from June 4 to July 6, including shootings, assaults and acts of vandalism. All of these attacks, of course, have occurred against the backdrop of a presidential election season awash in vitriolic anti-Muslim political speech, most notably from Republican nominee Donald Trump and his advisers. Since 2015, Trump has proposed banning Muslims from entering the U.S., called for a national database of Muslims, said that mosques should be surveilled and Muslims should be profiled, suggested that the Muslim mother of a fallen American soldier didn’t speak at the Democratic National Convention because she wasn’t allowed to talk, and flat-out said that “Islam hates us.”Meanwhile, this election season has also seen a frightening surge in anti-Muslim attacks. According to the group Muslim Advocates, there have been over 100 hate crimes targeting Muslims in the U.S. since the Paris terror attacks last November. A report from The Bridge Initiative found that there were more acts of anti-Muslim violence and vandalism in 2015 than in any year since the 9/11 attacks. And a report from the Council on American-Islamic Relations found 78 instances in 2015 where mosques were targeted for vandalism, arson and other types of destruction ― quadruple the number from the year before.HuffPost has recorded more than 260 acts of anti-Muslim violence, discrimination and political speech in the United States so far in 2016.“It’s just really alarming to see that no matter how many times we publicly talk about these incidents, there still doesn’t seem to be an end in sight,” said Madihha Ahussain, a staff attorney at Muslim Advocates. “And we aren’t able to sort of change the way we’re talking about this. There needs to be some sort of action, like a large-scale solution to this problem.” Harb thinks there’s a small-scale solution, too. “One of the most important facts about Islamophobia to keep in mind is that most people who think all Muslims are terrorists have never met a Muslim,” he said. Sixty-three percent of Americans, in fact, don’t know any Muslims personally, a 2014 poll found. “There’s a starting point for all of us,” Harb said. “Before you allow yourself to hate all Muslims and buy into conspiracy theories about ‘Islamic radical terrorism’ peddled by the Trumps of the world, make a small effort to meet a Muslim and ask a question.”Eid al-Adha ends this Thursday. “Eid Mubarak,” a common Arabic greeting during the holiday, means “have a blessed celebration.”"

There needs to be some sort of action, like a large-scale solution to this problem.” Harb thinks there’s a small-scale solution, too. “One of the most important facts about Islamophobia to keep in mind is that most people who think all Muslims are terrorists have never met a Muslim,” he said. Sixty-three percent of Americans, in fact, don’t know any Muslims personally, a 2014 poll found. “There’s a starting point for all of us,” Harb said. “Before you allow yourself to hate all Muslims and buy into conspiracy theories about ‘Islamic radical terrorism’ peddled by the Trumps of the world, make a small effort to meet a Muslim and ask a question.”Eid al-Adha ends this Thursday. “Eid Mubarak,” a common Arabic greeting during the holiday, means “have a blessed celebration.”"
