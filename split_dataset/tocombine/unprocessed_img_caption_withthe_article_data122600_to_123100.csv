(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb75546240000320056fe5b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Joe Fortenbaugh, National Football PostThe NFL’s annual release of its regular season schedule is a beautiful thing. Wedged in between the commencement of the Major League Baseball season and start of both the Stanley Cup and NBA playoffs, our country’s most popular sport is capable of generating a ratings bonanza simply by announcing a bunch of dates. That’s it. Nothing has been won or lost this fine Wednesday evening, no players have switched teams, no franchises have moved cities. The only thing that has happened is that we now know Team A is playing Team B on this specific day at this predetermined time.And, for good reason, we can’t get enough of it.In essence, the National Football League has turned an administrative scheduling task—like that 1:00pm power lunch you have with Cliff from accounting—into a feeding frenzy of fandom complete with a televised primetime special. Juice like that simply isn’t available for purchase.We all have our favorite teams, most intriguing rivalries and preferred primetime matchups. Here are 15 I can’t wait to watch after the base tan fades away and the leaves fall from the trees.Note: We’re all going to be stoked for the Green Bay-Seattle Thursday night season-opener, so I left it off the list.15. Kansas City Chiefs at San Diego Chargers (Week 7, Sunday, 4:05pm eastern): The Andy Reid-Mike McCoy rivalry didn’t disappoint in its inaugural campaign, as McCoy’s Bolts squeaked by Reid’s Chiefs in both showdowns last season via a 26-yard touchdown pass with 24 seconds remaining on November 24 and a 36-yard overtime field goal on December 29. Four of the last six meetings between Kansas City and San Diego have been decided by a field goal or less.14. Indianapolis Colts at Denver Broncos (Week 1, Sunday, 8:30pm eastern): The first installment of “The Forehead” vs. “The Amish Beard” resulted in a 39-33 upset win in favor of Andrew Luck and the boys from Naptown, marking Denver’s only defeat during the first ten games of the 2013 campaign. Peyton Manning failed to stick it to his old club in his first attempt since departing from Indy. Will Round 2 be any different?13. Dallas Cowboys at Washington Redskins (Week 17, Sunday, 1:00pm eastern): If for no other reason than to laugh at the Cowboys when this inevitably becomes the fourth time in as many years that Dallas loses a postseason play-in game. Romo takes the heat while Jerry Jones brings Jason Garrett back for another spin.12. Baltimore Ravens at Pittsburgh Steelers (Week 9, Sunday, 8:30pm eastern): You want high scoring? Don’t worry, this list has plenty of shootouts to quench your thirst. As for the sadists walking among us, note that nine of the last 11 title fights between Baltimore and Pittsburgh have been decided by a field goal or less.11. New England Patriots at Green Bay Packers (Week 13, Sunday, 4:25pm eastern): It’s the first time Super Bowl MVPs Tom Brady and Aaron Rodgers will face each other as starting quarterbacks.10. San Francisco 49ers at Denver Broncos (Week 7, Sunday, 8:30pm eastern): The cheapest pair of khaki pants this side of the Atlantic Ocean gets its first crack at Peyton Manning since these two went head-to-head as starting quarterbacks back in 1998 and 1999. Jim Harbaugh and the Baltimore Ravens defeated a rookie Manning in ’98, 38-31, only to see the up-and-comer from Tennessee exact his revenge the following season on Harbaugh’s Chargers by way of a 27-19 victory.9. Green Bay Packers at New Orleans Saints (Week 8, Sunday, 8:30pm eastern): Three career meetings between Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers have resulted in a grand total of 2,067 passing yards, 19 touchdowns and 211 points scored. I wasn’t bullshitting you when I said this list had some surefire shootouts contained within. For the record, Rodgers owns a 2-1 edge over Brees in the series.8. Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Chicago Bears (Week 12, Sunday, 1:00pm eastern): Can you imagine the Windy City headlines if Chicago castoffs Lovie Smith and Josh McCown saunter off Soldier Field with a win over Marc Trestman and Jay Cutler? Highly unlikely anybody questions J-Cut’s $126.7 million contract in that scenario.7. Carolina Panthers at Baltimore Ravens (Week 4, Sunday, 1:00pm eastern): “I want to make sure that whatever team I go to, they’re going to get the best, in shape 35-year-old guy they can get. If that happens to run through Bank of America Stadium, put your goggles on cause there’s going to be blood and guts everywhere.”--Ravens wide receiver Steve Smith, shortly after his release from the Carolina PanthersIn case you were wondering, yes, that’s the same Steve Smith who got booted from Carolina’s training camp back in 2008 after flooring cornerback Ken Lucas with a punch to the dome.6. Denver Broncos at New England Patriots (Week 9, Sunday, 4:25pm eastern): Because it’s the 15th installment of the Brady-Manning rivalry. Because their legacies will be linked together until the end of time. And because none of us has any idea how many of these epic showdowns we have left.5. Seattle Seahawks at San Francisco 49ers (Week 13, Thursday, 8:30pm eastern): There’s no more denying it: Pete Carroll owns Jim Harbaugh. Carroll got him in college (two championships to zero) and now he’s done it at the professional ranks. What makes this matchup so damn mouth-watering is that both guys know it. Carroll knows he owns Harbaugh and Harbaugh knows he answers to Carroll. This, in turn, is why both men hate each other, even if neither will admit it. It’s also why their respective teams want to dismantle each other and why their fan bases despise one another. Simply put, it’s the best rivalry in football and we get to witness this installment of it Thanksgiving evening.4. New York Jets at New England Patriots (Week 7, Thursday, 8:25pm eastern): Because of that moment we all know is coming, when newly acquired Patriots cornerback Darrelle Revis intercepts Jets quarterback Michael Vick and takes it 95 yards to the house. Because Belichick will play coy with the media after while laughing on the inside. Because it will drive Rex’s fist through a wall.3. San Francisco 49ers at New Orleans Saints (Week 10, Sunday, 1:00pm eastern): That 23-20 Saints victory over San Fran last November left a bad taste in the mouths of many due to a highly controversial fourth quarter call made in New Orleans’ favor. This matchup gives both teams the opportunity to settle the score in one of the most hostile venues in the National Football League. These are the games for which safety Jairus Byrd was signed.2. Washington Redskins at Philadelphia Eagles (Week 3, Sunday, 1:00pm eastern): This is going to be the NFC East’s most ferocious rivalry for the next five years. New head coach Jay Gruden, a 100 percent healthy Robert Griffin III and wide receiver DeSean Jackson—complete with his copy of Philadelphia’s playbook—travel north on I-95 to challenge Chip Kelly’s fast-rising Eagles. Keeping with traditional South Philly fashion, Jackson will be booed every time he touches the football. The question is whether or not he can make the big play to break Philadelphia’s back. Remember, it was Washington who was supposed to take control of the NFC East with the arrival of RG3, but the Birds stole the ‘Skins thunder with the hiring of Kelly.1. Denver Broncos at Seattle Seahawks (Week 3, Sunday, 4:25pm eastern): It’s the rematch of one of the most lethal ass-kickings quarterback Peyton Manning has ever been forced to endure. Except that this time it’s taking place in the supersonic jet engine known as CenturyLink Field. The Seahawks hosted two primetime games in the Pacific Northwest last season (San Francisco and New Orleans), winning both by the combined score of 63-10.Hit me up on Twitter: @JoeFortenbaugh"

Paul Ryan (R-WI), House Budget Committee Chairman, speaks during the American Conservative Union Conference March 6, 2014 in National Harbor, Maryland. The annual conference is a meeting of politically conservatives Americans. AFP PHOTO/Brendan SMIALOWSKI (Photo credit should read BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c5e9220000bb01dd770f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It is not clear whether Paul Ryan's comments last month about poverty and African Americans were intended to be racist, but it is difficult not to interpret them that way. Perhaps Ryan did not realize that ""inner-city"" is racial code for African American or that Charles Murray is seen by many as a racist psuedo-scholar rather than an authority on poverty. It is also possible that Ryan does not understand that poverty and unemployment are hardly problems limited to the inner cities or to African Americans.Ryan's true intentions may not be knowable, but the comments themselves are revealing, but not because of their substance. We already know that Ryan's views on economics lean toward lowering taxes cutting programs that might help poor people and relying on the magic of the market. Anybody with those beliefs will naturally support any argument that suggests the way to solve poverty problems is not through increased social spending, so there is no surprise there.Ryan, however, is not just another conservative member of Congress. He has spent several years trying to establish his bona fides as deep conservative economic thinker, largely by pouring old supply side wine into new powerpoint bottles. He is also a past, and very likely future, candidate for national office. Ryan may have made these comments deliberately, knowing the anger it would precipitate from African Americans, as a way to signal to the Republican base that he could be trusted to be sufficiently conservative. If that is the case, then Ryan was indeed speaking in a racist way.There is another, perhaps more plausible, but equally disturbing explanation. Perhaps Ryan believes that cultural issues contribute to poverty, and meaning to speak about poverty generally, unwittingly used racially coded language and invoked the name of a writer who has been accused of being a racist. If this is true, it reveals that a national Republican figure has thought so little about race in American that he does not know the very basics of how to speak about poverty without stumbling into accusations of racism.This, is unfortunately a reasonably plausible scenario, but one that underscores that in a country that is more racially diverse every day, the Republican Party, Ryan after all is generally presented as one of the smarter and more thoughtful nationally prominent Republicans, does not understand the very basics of how to speak about race and poverty. To some extent this is to be expected given not only that African Americans vote heavily Democratic, but that Republicans rarely even seek African American votes anymore. In this regard Ryan is simply a representative of his party and his time. The impact this has had and will continue to have on the US is nonetheless significant. Because Republicans do not seek African American votes, there is no need for them to have a lot of contact with African Americans at all. Therefore, Republicans do not need to, and generally do not, understand the problems, challenges and concerns that are particularly distinct for African Americans. For example, for inner city African Americans, the absence of good jobs, predatory lending, the prison-industrial complex and bad schools are considerably more serious issues than Ryan's amorphous cultural explanations.A Republican Party that has over a period of decades removed itself from any close political contact with African Americans not only will naturally have a very poor understanding of that group, but will be committed to the belief that race is no longer an important issue in the US. If race is not an important issue, it is much easier for Republicans to explain away their lack of success with or interest in African Americans. This contributes to the Republican insistence that racism is a thing of the past and that any suggestion that race or racism is driving a policy or campaign tactics is dismissed as somebody else is playing the race card.Ryan's comments last month reflect a political climate where Republicans not only do not meaningfully speak to African American citizens, but they tell themselves and their supporters stories about politics and economics that will ensure that they do not have to speak to African American voters in the future. This is, in the short term, bad for the Republican Party as it means that in order to win elections in many states, they have to run up margins among white voters that are increasingly difficult to attain. More significantly it institutionalizes a political environment where denying the enduring effects of racism becomes a political and psychological survival strategy for almost half of the polity."

The document proposes that low-level marijuana cases ""will be immediately dismissed"" if the defendant has a minimal criminal or no criminal record at all.The memo goes on to state, “We are pouring money and effort into an endeavor that produces no public safety benefit for the community.""For multiple years, marijuana possession -- which is only a criminal charge in New York City if the marijuana is ""in public view"" -- has been the city's most common reason for arraignment in New York City. In 2013, Brooklyn alone dealt with more than 8,500 arraignments for criminal possession in the fifth degree, the majority of which were ultimately dismissed. The proposal is in line with Kenneth Thompson's statements about marijuana at his inaugural address in February.""I not only want to keep Brooklyn safe, I want to protect the future of our youth,"" he said at the address. ""That means we must change the policy regarding those who are arrested for possessing small amounts of marijuana."" A 2011 report by the Drug Policy Alliance states that black and Latino men are disproportionately arrested for marijuana possession due to the NYPD's stop-and-frisk policy, which unfairly targets these demographics. During these searches, police frequently tell individuals to empty their pockets. When an individual pulls a small amount of marijuana out of their pocket, that person can then be charged with having marijuana in public view. The number of stop-and-frisk street stops has declined sharply in recent months, and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has pledged to reform the tactic. "

Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) has repeatedly said he wouldn't jump into the race to unseat Florida Gov. Rick Scott (R). But that doesn't mean Nelson isn't tempted. The Daytona Beach News-Journal reported Wednesday that Nelson expressed a lingering interest in the Florida gubernatorial race as he met with local business leaders. He cited Scott's decision to decline federal dollars for high-speed rail and to not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act as two areas where he doesn't like Scott's decisions. “I think it’s not only a shame, I think it’s a moral abscess,"" Nelson said in reference to effects of the Medicaid decision, according to the paper. Florida’s refusal to expand the program means more than 1.2 million Floridians lose out on the opportunity for Medicaid coverage. Scott's presumed general election opponent in November is former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist, who served as a Republican before becoming an independent and then subsequently a Democrat. Former Rep. Jim Davis (Fla.) and national Democratic officials speculated in 2013 that Nelson would run, though they expected him to have made his decision by now. “I firmly believe he is considering the race,” Davis told MSNBC in November. Nelson criticized Scott in December over restrictions on voting via absentee ballot, saying it was ""so obvious"" the governor's administration was working to make it harder for people to vote. "
6,POLITICS,The Usual Suspects Aim To Spoil Iran Nuclear Deal,"John Tirman, ContributorExecutive Director, MIT Center for International Studies",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iran-spoilers-redux_b_5206603.html,"The longtime pattern of the U.S.-Iran relationship: spoilers never go away, they just regroup and try to despoil again and again.",2014-04-24,"Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks as he chairs the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem on Sunday, March 9, 2014.

(AP Photo/Gali Tibbon, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c5f2250000cf003a4f30.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the negotiations over Iran's nuclear program proceed -- apparently with steady progress toward a comprehensive agreement -- and Iran demonstrates to the world it is abiding by the interim agreement signed last fall, the usual suspects who hope to derail this progress have been relatively quiet. But we can expect the calm to end soon. That's the longtime pattern of the U.S.-Iran relationship: spoilers never go away, they just regroup and try to despoil again and again.The attempt by the Israel Lobby in particular to scuttle the negotiations at the behest of Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu failed earlier this year. The gambit was to intimidate Congress into passing crippling conditions on the talks and indeed new sanctions, even as Iran was complying with the interim deal. The most powerful pro-sanctions group, American Israel Public Affairs Committee, or AIPAC, finally backed off, seeing that several Democratic leaders in the Senate were not going to be coerced. So the last three months have been quiet as the P5+1 (the five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, plus Germany) negotiate with Iran to reach a comprehensive -- that is to say, final -- deal that will constrain Iran's capacity to ""weaponize"" its civil nuclear power program, to which it's entitled under the terms of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). The high probability is that a final deal will permit Iran some capacity for enrichment of uranium, also permitted under the NPT, but at levels so low that there is no danger of weaponizing. The interim deal implicitly has that provision, and Iran would not accept anything less. (Israel, not so incidentally, is not a signatory of the NPT and has up to 200 nuclear weapons.) It will be this aspect of the final agreement that will provoke the spoilers yet again, even though airtight inspection and monitoring provisions will prevent breakout toward a weapon.But the spoilers are gearing up using a different tactic, which is to undermine the legitimacy of Hassan Rouhani, the reform-minded president elected nearly one year ago. The Wall Street Journal, owned by right-wing majordomo Rupert Murdoch, chimed in this week with an attack on Rouhani for the treatment of some prisoners in a Tehran lockup. In a piece entitled ""Rouhani's Republic of Fear"" (recalling Kanan Makiya's book about Saddam Hussein), the Journal opined: ""Perhaps a regime, and a president, that can brutalize political dissidents as a matter of routine can prove reasonable at the nuclear negotiating table. We wouldn't count on it, and neither should the West."" Coming from a country that has the highest number of imprisoned citizens and a shameful system of racial bias in sentencing, that's a bit much. But the strategy is clear: disparage and delegitimize the popular Rouhani, who has pushed for more openness in society and is, by all accounts, adhering to nuclear obligations.The Heritage Foundation has similarly been at work. In a forum last week, it raised not only the human rights issue, but Iran's alleged support for terrorism. The longstanding protocols of arms control have always excluded extraneous issues, not because they're unimportant, but because the challenge of nuclear restraint -- filled with technical details and political compromises -- is complicated enough without entering into a rhetorical contest over who is worse on other issues. Then there's the tempest-in-a-teapot over Iran's naming an envoy to the U.N. who had served as a translator in the 1979-80 U.S. embassy hostage crisis. This appointment of a reformer who has long served as a diplomat was turned absurdly into a virtual new 9/11 threat. From this thin reed the right-wing Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin went ballistic:""Iran remains a terrorist state and will manipulate international institutions to its advantage with no intention of changing the underlying nature of the regime,"" she wrote on April 3. This view, she avers, ""is so obviously true, one wonders why any responsible lawmaker would indulge the administration in its folly."" So, you see, Rouhani is an abuser of human rights and a terrorist. Iran is hence beyond redemption and should not be treated as a ""normal"" state. The implication, of course, is that a nuclear deal of any kind -- no matter how much in keeping with the NPT and how tightly regulated Iran's nuclear program would be -- is not worth pursuing. This is classic spoiler behavior. Just about everyone sees a nuclear deal as a godsend to a region in perpetual turmoil. Such an agreement could have powerful, salutary effects on Iran's relations with its Gulf neighbors, on possible diplomatic approaches to the Syria crisis, and other nettlesome problems. And one suspects that because it has such potentially positive effects, the deal is opposed by Israel, which has fed off the specter of a nuclear Iran for many years. We will see more of this hysteria as an agreement between Iran and the P5+1 draws near. It would be a small miracle if the United States and Iran, who have nourished each other's misperceptions of the other for 35 years, could ignore the spoilers and write a new narrative of a new relationship. John Tirman is coauthor and coeditor, most recently, of U.S.-Iran Misperceptions: A Dialogue (Bloombury). "

Rayman will need to turn over mostly documents written by Schoolcraft himself.""I was very impressed with him and I think it's a very fair order,"" the former Village Voice reporter said of the judge. ""He eliminated all of the really broad demands that the city had made for documents.""Schoolcraft's lawsuit alleges that his superiors at the NYPD had him sent to a psychiatric ward after he complained about quotas used to force officers to make bad arrests. Rayman chronicled Schoolcraft's ordeal in a series of articles for the Voice and then a book.The city's request for what Rayman estimates could be hundreds or thousands of documents in his possession had threatened to spark a municipal version of the ongoing battles at the federal version over a reporter's right to keep communications with sources confidential.Rayman said Wednesday he still has to discuss the judge's order with his lawyer, but it looks it's narrowly tailored enough that he could be ready to comply. Schoolcraft lawyer Nathaniel Smith did not return a request for comment. The city law department told the New York Daily News that it was pleased with the decision.In a March declaration to the court, Rayman had noted the irony of the city trying to bring more information about Schoolcraft into the public record now, after it stonewalled his requests for information about the case for years.""The city should always be given a hard time about trying to do this, and it shouldn't feel comfortable in subpoenaing reporters,"" said Rayman.

So it's only fitting that the former congresswoman was chosen to profile the Pakistani teen activist, named one of Time magazine's ""100 Most Influential People in the World"" Wednesday.Giffords wrote for Time that she, like many people, draws inspiration and strength from Yousafzai, who was shot in the head by the Taliban in 2012. ""Malala is a testament that women everywhere will not be intimidated into silence.""Giffords, who was shot in the head in Tuscon, Ariz. in 2011, also wrote that Yousafzai's courage is rare, comparing her to military members or global leaders:""I have seen courage in many places…but Malala’s courage is uncommon,"" Giffords wrote. Yousafzai advocates for young people worldwide through the Malala Fund, an organization that partners with local nonprofits to educate youth. She highlights the fact that is much at stake in providing education. UNESCO reports, for example, that a child born to a mother who can read is 50 percent more likely to live past age 5. The young education advocate spoke at the UN this past July and reminded viewers that everyone's voice matters in the fight for education:""One child, one teacher, one pen and one book can change the world,"" said Yousafzai, who told CNN that she wants to become prime minister of Pakistan one day.The teen activist, who published her first book ""I Am Malala"" in October, was also nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize last year year.

11,SPORTS,American Soccer Fans Not Impressed With Gus Johnson,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gus-johnson-american-fans-not-impressed_n_5206457.html,,2014-04-24,"NEW YORK, NY - AUGUST 16: Bill Raftery, Gus Johnson, Regis Philbin, Katie Nolan and Georgie Thompson ring the opening bell at the NASDAQ MarketSite on August 16, 2013 in New York City. (Photo by Craig Barritt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb755462600003001834675.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Matt Yoder, Awful Announcing Before this knockout round of the Champions League began, I called this slate of European games a “make or break” season for Gus Johnson as a Fox Soccer announcer.  In his second year with Fox Soccer, this would be the time the narrative would be set on Johnson’s viability as a soccer announcer.Without the ability to lean on his rookie status, this is the time for American soccer fans to embrace or reject Gus Johnson as the present and future voice of the sport. He’s not a rookie anymore and the training wheels have to be taken off at some point. Although Johnson is relatively new at soccer announcing, viewers are now well within their rights to set him alongside the likes of Ian Darke and Martin Tyler.They say you only get one chance to make a first impression. That chance has come and gone. Soccer fans are notorious for being the most difficult and most demanding fanbase to please as far as television announcers go. Fox knew that and still went with the experimental route. Unfortunately for Fox and Johnson, fans are saying they’ve had enough. These were the reactions during the Champions League semifinal between Real Madrid and Bayern Munich.listening to gus johnson commentate soccer is akin to waterboarding.The reaction to Johnson (and broadcast partner Eric Wynalda) was universally negative in social media. Naturally this should come with a warning that Twitter reviews don’t speak for everybody. But it’s concerning that you could hardly find a single viewer praising Johnson or Wynalda for their work yesterday. We’re talking Tim McCarver territory, here. The feedback for Johnson & Wynalda is in the same ballpark as the vociferous outrage over Chris Berman appearing at golf’s US Open.This shouldn’t just concern Fox executives that have expressed their commitment to this grand experiment, it should alarm them. It should send them into a panic, cracking each others’ heads open and feasting on the goo inside. If fans are this opposed to Johnson now, it might be too far gone for them to change their minds.Even if Johnson shows slight improvement year over year from now until 2018, he will have already lost fans by the time the World Cup comes around. That’s the cold, harsh reality that Fox is missing.If you watched yesterday’s game between Bayern Munich and Real Madrid and compared it to last year, there was certainly a marked improvement. Johnson seems more comfortable calling the flow of the game and not just the big moments. Fans criticize Johnson for sounding like he’s reading off the media guide to drop in factoids throughout the broadcast, but that’s a particularly harsh and unfair criticism. If it was another announcer dropping those stats, he’d be applauded for being informative. But there are clearly still enough mistakes and enough moments when Johnson mixes up his verbage or doesn’t execute a call that causes fans to turn away.And all of this is not withstanding the fact that Fox has still not found a reliable partner for Johnson as an analyst. Ian Wright and Warren Barton had their respective spells and after watching yesterday’s Champions League semifinal, Eric Wynalda does not seem to be the answer either. At times yesterday it was difficult to tell if the pair were in the same broadcast booth, let alone on the same continent.ESPN and NBC have set the bar ridiculously high for quality soccer coverage in this country. We’re light years away from the days of Fox Sports World and ESPN’s coverage of the sport as a foreign novelty. To their credit, Fox has improved their overall soccer presentation. The studio is a lot better, the tactical analysis is better, and there are no more Michael Strahan segments. However, the network has come under fire when compared to their competitors because Gus Johnson isn’t up to the standard of Arlo White, Ian Darke, or Phil Schoen (anyone who says there aren’t any good American soccer commentators is just being lazy). If Piers Morgan walked into the ESPN studios to analyze soccer, Bob Ley would self-combust.As a soccer fan and a fan of Gus Johnson, I hope this doom and gloom is not the final chapter. I hope there’s still a way forward and viewers can remain patient while Johnson grows into a top flight soccer announcer. If Fox and Gus are successful, the long term impact for American soccer would be a huge positive. Soccer fans should be rooting for Fox to succeed and carry the coverage of the sport forward.But it’s tough to ask viewers to be patient for two years during the most prestigious yearly soccer tournament on the planet over a broadcasting experiment. I’m afraid Fox is inching ever closer to the reality that it’s going to be nearly impossible to win the very vocal, loyal soccer fan back if major changes aren’t eventually made. Their minds might already be made up. "

""The diamond, the decorations, and the dread of yet another losing season.""Sure, the Cubs haven't won a pennant since 1945, or a World Series since 1908.

14,HEALTHY LIVING,Recovery Expressions That Blew My Mind,"Anna David, ContributorAuthor",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/addiction-recovery_b_5194789.html,"Sitting in meetings, or just talking to people outside of them, I'd hear stuff that some could say was were nearly cliché-like in its simplicity but it made so much sense that I couldn't help repeating it to nearly everyone I came into contact with.",2014-04-23,http://kuaijibbs.com/istockphoto/banner/zhuce1.jpg ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9e01722000003100fe2e70.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My first six months in recovery, it's no exaggeration to say that I felt my mind expanding on a regular basis. Not only was I shocked that I didn't actually have to ingest vats of cocaine up my nose every few days, but I was also astounded by the rules for living that I was suddenly being given.I grew up in a house where my dad used to joke so often that the Golden Rule was that whoever makes the gold makes the rules, I never actually knew there was another Golden Rule. In short, I grew up believing that in order to be happy, you had to go to an Ivy League school, make six figures at your first job and sue people before they sued you. I had no idea that it was my self-absorption that was making me miserable, let alone that I had esteem issues and was angry to an almost un-live-able degree. Sitting in meetings, or just talking to people outside of them, I'd hear stuff that some could say was were nearly cliché-like in its simplicity but it made so much sense that I couldn't help repeating it to nearly everyone I came into contact with. Some people didn't get it -- I already explained where I come from -- but often those who did would think I was some sort of a genius (I'm reasonably certain I took credit at least some of the time). The expressions I got the most mileage out of were:When you point a finger at someone, there are three pointing back at you.I'll never forget a guy named David saying this to me outside a meeting when I was maybe three months sober. I was complaining about someone -- a skill I excel at, even today -- when this guy who had what I thought then was a nearly unfathomable amount of sober time (five years, maybe?) casually offered up this chestnut as feedback. It was his way of saying that those things that enraged me the most about the object of my disdain were actually the exact same things I did when I was at my most egregious and that's why I was so pissed off. (I did get a little hung up on trying to figure out where the fifth finger went, though.)Resentment is like drinking poison and expecting someone else to die.Oh, how this one blew my mind. I had spent a large portion of my life enraged at the various and sundry people I felt had wronged me (see above) and I truly, genuinely believed on a certain level that I was so powerful in my anger, my dirty looks and silent seething actually had an impact on them, rather than realizing it only made me look slightly unhinged. I thought I was protecting myself with all this anger, not realizing that the only one I hurt was me. This isn't, of course, to say that I don't occasionally still indulge in juicy resentments now and again.I'm not much but I'm all I think about.This one, and its stepsister, ""I'm the piece of crap in the center of the universe,"" was another one that stopped me in my tracks. Most of my life, my self-absorption had been off the charts and it was matched only by my self-loathing. And I didn't have any idea until the day I heard this one and felt how much it resonated. Before recovery, I thought the world revolved around me but I also regularly told myself I was stupid and unlovable. Again, I'm much better now, but I still make some trips to the annex of self-obsession and self-hatred.Expectations are resentments under construction.Boy, were my expectations high back in the day -- expectations of you mainly. This meant that I regularly wondered why I had such bad friends, horrible family members and terrible bosses. I basically decided that you were all going to do exactly what I felt you should and then felt incredibly hurt and resentful when you did not. And I had no idea I was writing scripts in my head for everyone to follow! I still have a hard time keeping my expectations low but I'm inspired by the most serene people I know, who seem to expect very little from other people and save a lot of time resenting them and expecting them to die.Hang out in the barbershop long enough, and you'll find yourself getting a haircut.Okay I'll admit that this is my least favorite of the five listed here, only because I think it sounds a little silly. But I'm wholly behind its message -- which, to me, basically means that you'll probably eventually drink if you bar hop with your old crowd, will have an urge for powder stimulants if you keep in touch with your dealer and will inevitably enter slacker-dom if you piss away your time with sad people who aren't motivated. And also, of course, that your hair will surely come out shorter if you do a lot of time at the barbershop.Need help with substance abuse or mental health issues?

But the New York campaign was just a small one. ""100 different Wack Donald's characters are waiting to pop up, each one chosen for special reasons for different countries."" You can expect the social campaign will also follow the postering campaign closely because Mr OneTeas considers the fast food to be on par with tobacco. ""On the cigarette packs in France you can read 'Smoking Kills'. My thoughts are that I would like to make people realize that eating junk food can kill as well,"" he says.Guess we'll just have to follow his Instagram to see how the campaign progresses.

18,BUSINESS,IKEA To Roll Out Vegetarian Meatballs,Kevin Short,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ikea-vegetarian-meatballs_n_5193646.html,,2014-04-23,"Meat balls are served in a restaurant of Ikea in Amsterdam on March 23, 2013. Swedish furniture giant Ikea said last week it had started gradually reintroducing meatballs in its restaurants worldwide after horsemeat was found in the product last month.

The vegetarian meatballs are part of IKEA's effort to reduce the environmental impact of its estimated 150 million meatballs sold per year.""We are aware of the meat issue with greenhouse gases,” Joanna Yarrow, head of sustainability for Ikea in the UK, said at an environmental conference in London, according to a report last week in the Telegraph. “We are looking at all our food products from a sustainability perspective but specifically meatballs. They are very popular and they are also our most carbon-intensive food item on our menu.”IKEA's furniture has been a staple of dorm rooms and apartments for years. But that doesn't mean the ubiquitous wooden desks, beds and dressers come without a cost: The Guardian reported in 2012 that according to its calculation, almost 1 percent of the world's commercial wood is used to build IKEA products. Merely switching over to the oxymoronic ""meat-free meatballs"" won't single-handedly solve the larger issue at hand (though they do sound a lot more appetizing than horsemeat balls).That being said, it's a welcome step. According to the environmental news site Business Green, the World Wildlife Fund will advise Ikea on how to revise some of its recipes so they have less of an environmental impact. A full 98 percent of IKEA products are made from recycled or recyclable products, according to company reports, and the brand aims produce as much renewable energy as it consumes by 2020. "

The winner of three Academy Awards and a 12-time nominee (the most by any male actor), he remains one of the most iconic figures in American film history. He first rose to prominence in the late sixties and early seventies, reflecting a grittier, more earthy screen male in New Hollywood era films like Chinatown, Easy Rider and Five Easy Piece, and has been a fixture at Lakers games and red carpets ever since. Though rumors have spread recently that the star intends to hang it up for good as a performer, not even a prolonged absence from the screen can remove that smirk -- and those shades -- from our collective hearts. In honor of the man's name day, here's Jack at his most insightful:""I'll tell you one thing: Don't ever give anybody your best advice, because they're not going to follow it.""  ""It's very easy to go down, so always live up. Incline yourself upward."" ""Always try in interviews to avoid the cliches about the problems of public life. Always try to avoid interviews."" ""If men are honest, everything they do and everywhere they go is for a chance to see women."" ""There's only two people in your life you should lie to... the police and your girlfriend."" ""With my sunglasses on, I'm Jack Nicholson. Without them, I'm fat and 60."" ""The minute that you're not learning I believe you're dead."" ""People who speak in metaphors should shampoo my crotch.""
