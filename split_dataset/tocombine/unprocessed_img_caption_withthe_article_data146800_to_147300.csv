Usher has yet to respond to the request, but we hope he says ""yes!""We'd like to urge Usher not to take a cue from Michael Bublé, who last month announced that he hates being asked to sing at weddings. ""People know how successful I am, but they don’t give a s**t, they don’t,"" Bublé said. “The best part is that people are so cute about it. They will literally look at you and they will be so sincere and say, ‘Listen, my daughter is getting married in August and if you could come, honestly your whole band, they will eat and drink for free.’ And I’m like, ‘OK I’ll be there,’ but of course, I will never be there!""That's harsh, Bublé.Click through the slideshow below to see which celebrities have performed at weddings.Keep in touch!
