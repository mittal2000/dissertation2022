The tech giant has drawn employees to move to the city, which has helped drive up rents, and the company has also been criticized in the past for failing to do its part in donating to local charities, the Seattle Times reported. Now, however, Amazon says it’s prepared to step up to help its homeless neighbors.The company is temporarily donating a 34,500-square-foot building it recently bought as part of its campus expansion, according to the Times. It’s giving it to Mary’s Place, a local nonprofit that provides housing and resources to homeless families. The group will be able to use it as an emergency shelter until the spring of 2017, which was when Amazon was slated to start construction on the building.“As we grow in Seattle, we recognize the importance of investing in our hometown in ways that benefit our neighbors and our employees,” John Schoettler, Amazon director of global real estate and facilities, said in a statement. “We wanted to help out in a time of great need.”The move comes at a time when Seattle is facing “dramatic” increases in homelessness.On a single night in January last year, there were 10,047 people living in shelters, on the streets and in transitional housing. That marked a 19 percent increase from 2014, according to the point-in-time count.Seattle outlined a $5.3 million plan in November to address the crisis. King County proposed an additional $2 million. The Amazon property will shelter between 60 and 70 families, and each family will have their own room with a bathroom, according to the Times. Families will be able to stay in the center from 5 p.m. to 8 a.m. on weekdays, and it will remain open 24 hours a day on weekends, according to the Times.“We are so excited about our new home,” Mary’s Place announced on Facebook."

Her statements, initially given in a private interview to the FBI, were leaked to the press, causing the committee to further investigate. During her testimony, Hill said that after the leak, ""I felt I had to tell the truth. I could not keep silent."" At the time of the hearings, Hill was a law professor at the University of Oklahoma and testified that Thomas initiated conversations with her about lewd sex acts and porn films. Thomas, a staunch conservative, has always vehemently denied these accusations and eventually went on to win the confirmation and to succeed Thurgood Marshall, the court’s first black Supreme Court Justice. ""Confirmation"" focuses on the grueling three-day hearings, and explores how race, sex and politics intersected in a polarizing case that divided America. “It was such an earthquake in terms of how we deal with sexual harassment and how we deal with race,"" Famuyiwa said. ""Even though we don’t talk about that event as much, the reverberations that came from that politically and how we even cover news like this was really altered by this one event.""Race was pushed to the forefront of the hearings when Thomas gave a statement denouncing them as ""a high-tech lynching for uppity blacks,"" and insinuated that Hill was being used as a ploy to destroy him. It was a description so damning that many, including Hill, believed it instilled dread among the all-white, all-male committee members who distanced themselves from challenging Thomas to the full degree. These moments marked some of the most riveting in the film, including a moment when Hill's counsel admits to her that the hearings would have gone much differently had Hill looked like Thomas' wife, a white woman. Ultimately, the hearings became a case of “he said, she said.” And although Thomas was confirmed in a 52-48 vote, the outcome wasn't perceived as a total defeat by all. Hill’s testimony drew admiration and support from women who were encouraged enough by her bravery to speak up about their own experiences of sexual harassment. ""Sexual harassment was a dirty little secret that most women had but they didn't talk about,” NPR's Nina Totenberg, who was the first reporter to break Hill’s story, told with the network’s politics podcast Wednesday. ""Now suddenly, it gets popped into the open.

The press even called it “The Year of the Woman."" To Washington, whose poignant portrayal of Hill was not a far departure from the fearless, smart and outspoken woman she plays onscreen as “Scandal” star Olivia Pope, Hill's story is one that still inspires her, and many others, to this day. “You can say she lost but you can also say she won,"" Washington said.

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) came under fire earlier this month for implying that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was “not qualified” to be president of the United States. Women who support Clinton found the comment particularly insulting because of its gendered implications.Sanders has claimed that it was merely a response to the Clinton campaign’s insinuation that he was not qualified, which was in a Washington Post article headline. Neither Clinton nor her campaign has said that explicitly.Sanders has said Clinton is qualified because of her political experience, but that he questions her policy judgment. He reiterated that argument on Thursday.“Does Secretary Clinton have the experience and intelligence to be president? Of course she does,” Sanders said. “But I do question her judgment.”He went on to list her vote for the Iraq War, her receipt of campaign donations from super PACs and other decisions as evidence of this flawed judgment.Clinton was not having it.“I’ve been called many things in my life,” Clinton said of the “not qualified” descriptor. “That was a first.”“The people of New York voted for me twice to be their senator from New York and President Obama trusted my judgment enough to name me secretary of state,” Clinton added.She went on to cite Sanders’ grilling at the hands of the New York Daily Newsearlier this month as evidence that he is unprepared on policy.“Talk about judgment, talk about the kinds of problems he has answering questions about even his core issue: breaking up the banks,” Clinton said.Sanders finished the exchange by again enumerating the policies on which he believes Clinton has exercised flawed judgment such as the Iraq War and the influence of big money in politics."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) sided with the striking Verizon workers this week, Democratic congressional candidate Zephyr Teachout had already made their cause a core part of her campaign. Teachout, best known for her 2014 primary challenge to New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, is running to fill an open seat in a Hudson Valley district. She's an academic who specializes in antitrust issues and economic history, and sees big telecom companies as a threat to both consumers and workers.""We really have the worst aspects of monopolization,"" she said. ""This is bad for customers. It's also terrible for workers, which is what we're seeing with Verizon right now, because basically the company can say to customers as the company says to workers, take it or leave it. It doesn't have to provide good service, it doesn't have to take care of its workers."" Listen to our interview with Teachout on ""So That Happened,"" the HuffPost Politics podcast.

Teachout said Franklin Delano Roosevelt's efforts to remake the economy after the Great Depression, and particularly after the Rural Electrification Act, inspire her politics. ""It lit up the country. It changed the economy of the country not just in the installations but in actually creating the possibility for economic growth everywhere,"" Teachout said.Signed by FDR in 1936, the act began a process that eventually brought electricity to the vast majority of American farms, which had been underserved by power companies unwilling to invest in the infrastructure needed to carry electricity to sparsely populated areas.""The Rural Electrification Act of the 21st century is broadband,"" she said. ""Every farmhouse, every garage, every home, every business needs high-speed, competitive, affordable broadband.""Tens of millions of Americans lack broadband at home, and various members of Congress have looked to rural electrification as a model for expanding broadband. Since the 1980s, the Federal Communications Commission has run a program called Lifeline that helps poor people get telephone access, which is crucial to securing employment. The service is popularly known to some conservatives as the ""Obamaphone"" program even though it started under Ronald Reagan. The commission voted in March to expand Lifeline to help poor people pay for broadband service, though the subsidy amounts to $9.25 per month. ""I'm not against programs that certainly allow people to pay for tough bills, but that's a Band-Aid, that's not a fundamental solution,"" Teachout said."

While his national profile has since skyrocketed, much of the public is still paying only cursory attention to Sanders or his positions -- especially with Donald Trump overwhelmingly dominating the airwaves.Sanders has also faced very little in the way of negative advertising. Of the roughly $383 million spent on campaign television advertising so far this year, only about 2 percent has gone to anti-Sanders ads, according to Elizabeth Wilner of the research firm Kantar Media. Much of those ads only briefly mentioned the candidate's name or image. Perhaps the most sustained barrage he's faced to date was a $600,000 conservative-backed campaign attacking him as ""too liberal,"" a charge that likely did little damage in the Democratic primary.And regardless of how durable Sanders' advantage in general election polls might be, his argument that he's more electable faces the same problem that Clinton's does -- it doesn't work if primary voters see both candidates as capable of winning in the general election, which, for the most part, they do. That's effectively neutralized the issue, with exit polls to date showing a fifth or fewer of Democratic voters in each state naming electability as their main concern.

13,POLITICS,Dennis Hastert Facing 'The Worst Of Both Worlds' Ahead Of Sentencing,Kim Bellware,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dennis-hastert-sentencing-lies_us_570ec219e4b03d8b7b9f6775,"The judge said Hastert's recent false statements will be a ""big"" factor in his sentencing decision.",2016-04-15,Dennis Hastert coached the wrestling team at Yorkville High School for nearly two decades.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/571028ba1900002e0056b439.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CHICAGO -- The legal woes of once-powerful former House Speaker Dennis Hastert have gone from bad to worse.A judge on Wednesday warned that false statements Hastert made to investigators last year will factor into his sentencing decision for a case that began as a white-collar crime probe and later unveiled claims of sexual abuse from decades ago.""That's not conduct that's 40 years old, that conduct is ... a year old,"" U.S. District Judge Thomas Durkin said, noting that he considered the particular conduct a ""big"" aggravating factor.In a damning 26-page filing from last Friday, prosecutors detailed how Hastert's lies inadvertently led investigators to five separate claims of sexual abuse or misconduct from individuals who where on the high school wrestling team Hastert coached more than 40 years ago.Among them was Individual A, who claimed Hastert molested him in a motel room during a wrestling trip when he was 14, prosecutors said. Hastert had initially told federal investigators he withdrew cash in small enough amounts to avoid bank reporting rules (an illegal practice known as structuring) because he was being extorted by Individual A.But after arranging to record Hastert demanding that Individual A end the extortion, investigators realized Hastert's claim of victimization didn't add up. Investigators found Individual A's response and tone to be ""inconsistent"" with that of an extortionist and noted he was even calm and understanding when Hastert said he couldn't get more money. In subsequent interviews, investigators learned from Individual A about the history of his relationship with Hastert.Prosecutors said Individual A asked Hastert for $3.5 million in compensation for the alleged abuse and Hastert agreed, but refused suggestions they formalize the agreement with lawyers.The judge's decision to flag Hastert's recent lie is ""significant,"" said Patrick Collins, a former assistant U.S. attorney in Chicago who prosecuted former Illinois Gov. George Ryan's corruption trial. ""That’s a pretty big deal — arguably, [Hastert's] calling the victim of his sexual misconduct an extortionist. It’s not exactly a way to curry favor with the government."" Hastert faces sentencing on April 27 over charges he tried to evade banking rules about cash withdrawals and lied about it to federal investigators -- a crime for which the recommended sentence is zero to six months, though it carries a maximum of five years in prison. Hastert, who is now 74 and in poor health, admitted guilt in October as part of a plea bargain to avoid a highly public trial and even more public airings of the salacious abuse allegations. ""It’s sort of the worst of both worlds for him: He pleads guilty to avoid the details of the misconduct going public, but now because of his denials, they’re going public anyway,"" said Hugh Mundy, a professor at John Marshall Law School in Chicago and former federal public defender.Both Collins and Mundy said the tone of the prosecution's sentencing position filing -- and subsequent response by Hastert's defense team, which suggests Hastert's ""groin rub"" and massage of Individual A doesn't qualify as sexual misconduct -- indicate the two sides disagree on what is appropriate punishment.Hastert's defense team has previously argued that he should be sentenced to just probation as the humiliation over the sexual misconduct allegations is punishment enough. ""Mr. Hastert acknowledges that as a young man he committed transgressions for which he is profoundly sorry,"" his legal team said in a recent statement. Hastert has not explicitly admitted to the specific sexual misconduct allegations against him. The lack of acknowledgment, Mundy said, will only make Hastert's sentencing day worse: One of his alleged victims and the sister of a now-deceased alleged victim are slated to testify at his hearing in two weeks. ""[Hastert’s] denials give the government a real avenue to bring in testimony that would otherwise be irrelevant in the sentencing,"" Mundy said. Mundy said the mitigating factors of Hastert's age and failing health will now be measured against those testimonies. The statute of limitations for the alleged sexual abuse has long since lapsed, but Collins acknowledged it is undeniably compelling that prosecutors would want to see Hastert punished with more than what amounts to a probationary sentence."

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) argued during Thursday's Democratic debate that the Palestinian people should be treated with dignity and that the United States shouldn’t always kowtow to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Hours earlier, Sanders' campaign suspended its new Jewish outreach director for advocating the exact same positions. The ninth debate between Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton featured a heated discussion about whether Israel’s invasion of Gaza in the summer of 2014 was a disproportionate response to rocket attacks fired into its territory by Hamas, as Sanders has said it was. It was a seminal campaign moment, made more salient because it happened in New York, a state where Jews comprise a larger share of the Democratic primary electorate than elsewhere. Clinton argued that Israel had a right to defend itself from terror attacks and blamed the Palestinians for failed peace negotiations. Sanders said something relatively sacrilegious for an American politician -- that Netanyahu “is not right all of the time.” “As somebody who is 100-percent pro-Israel ... in the long run, if we are ever going to bring peace to that region, which has seen so much hatred, and so much war, we are going to have to treat the Palestinian people with respect and dignity,” Sanders explained. “I believe the United States and the rest of the world have got to work together to help the Palestinian people. That does not make me anti-Israel. That paves the way, I think, to an approach that works in the Middle East.” This is what Simone Zimmerman, Sanders’ now-suspended Jewish outreach director, said she believes. And it's a good distillation of what J Street, the progressive advocacy group fighting for a two-state solution and against inertia in the American Jewish community, believes. (Zimmerman was president of J Street’s campus arm, J Street U, while in college.) As The New York Times reported Thursday evening, Sanders' campaign suspended Zimmerman just two days after it hired her, after the conservative Washington Free Beacon published a past Facebook post of hers in which she wrote, “F--- you Bibi,” using Netanyahu’s nickname, and described the Israeli leader as “arrogant, deceptive, cynical” and “manipulative.” She criticized Netanyahu for trying to “derail” the Iranian nuclear negotiations and for leading the charge into Gaza, where roughly 1,500 Palestinian civilians were killed during the 2014 invasion. (President Barack Obama also seems to agree with Zimmerman: He has complained about having to deal with Netanyahu, and a member of his administration reportedly called the prime minister ""chickenshit."" In turn, Netanyahu's spokesman has called Obama anti-Semitic and Secretary of State John Kerry ""childish."" Obama and Netanyahu's personal relationship, setting aside their countries' working relationship, is the worst ever between an American president and an Israeli prime minister.)Zimmerman’s suspension suggests a couple of things, including that Sanders’ campaign does not vet staff members and that it feared alienating New York's Jewish voters if it didn’t respond to the calls for her firing. ""The smear campaign being waged against Simone Zimmerman is a reflection of how out-of-touch the American Jewish establishment is with the Jewish community,” said Yonah Lieberman, who co-founded IfNotNow with Zimmerman and others. The group is dedicated to ending the American Jewish community’s support for the occupation of the Palestinian territories. “This is not the first sign of this disconnect -- it just the most blatant example of the American Jewish establishment trying to intimidate and silence young people acting on the very Jewish values we were taught by our community,” Lieberman continued. “The Jewish establishment won’t stand for anyone criticizing Israel -- no matter the truth or reason. When young Jews call for freedom and dignity for the Palestinians, the establishment can only respond with intimidation and fear.""Those who would otherwise have been thrilled with Sanders' debate rhetoric about being more “even-handed” in approaching the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were instead furious with him for suspending Zimmerman. Max Berger, another IfNotNow co-founder, started an #IStandWithSimone hashtag campaign on Twitter, which picked up more tweets as Sanders spoke during the debate. Sanders’ comments about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during the debate would have made waves at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee’s annual policy conference last month in Washington. He gave his stellar AIPAC speech at a high school in Utah, speaking at length about how settlements are counterproductive to peace. Clinton, in contrast, mentioned Israeli settlement construction just once in her AIPAC remarks and said the sorts of things that AIPAC supporters love to hear. Sanders criticized Clinton for “barely mentioning” the Palestinians. “I heard virtually no discussion at all about the needs of the Palestinian people,” he said. “Almost none in that speech. ... Of course Israel has a right to defend itself, but long term, there will never be peace in that region, unless the United States plays an even-handed role, trying to bring people together, and recognizing the serious problems that exist among the Palestinian people.”Clinton responded: “Describing the problem is a lot easier than trying to solve it.""""I was the person who held the last three meetings between the president of the Palestinian Authority and the Prime Minister of Israel … and I was absolutely focused on what was fair and right for the Palestinians, I was absolutely focused on what we needed to do to make sure the Palestinian people had the right to self government ... and get an agreement that will be both fair to the Israelis and the Palestinians without ever undermining Israel’s security,"" she added. Clinton capped her defense by arguing, “Nobody is saying that any individual leader is always right.” Said Sanders: “There comes a time when if we pursue justice and peace, we are going to have to say that Netanyahu is not right all of the time.” That’s the sort of tough talk that might get Sanders fired from his own campaign.

Hill, played by the stellar Kerry Washington, is distraught after Clarence Thomas makes his game-changing ""high-tech lynching"" statement, suggesting that Hill's allegations against him are simply perpetuating racist sexual stereotypes about black men. Hill's attorney, Charles Ogletree (Jeffrey Wright), tries to calm her down, but he also concedes that it was smart for Thomas to bring racism into the conversation.""This is political theater. And Thomas just performed,"" Ogletree explains. ""I hate that it was him of all people, but he did tell a truth."" Thomas, that day in 1991, did tell a truth about what it means to be a black man, a powerful black man, a black man with dissenting views, in America. But he used that truth to diminish another truth: Black women are constantly being thrown under the bus in the interest of propping up black men. Watch a clip from ""Confirmation"" in which Anita Hill and Charles Ogletree discuss Clarence Thomas's deposition below:In ""Confirmation,"" this second truth is epitomized as Hill, during her deposition, reveals that Thomas warned her to keep his inappropriate sexual remarks about pubic hair and his penis size secret because, ""If I ever told someone about his behavior, it would ruin his career."" The pressure of knowing one could be responsible for toppling everything a man like Thomas has achieved, is the kind of pressure that echoes throughout the lives of so many black women, during moments when they've felt the need to change or silence or hide themselves in order to protect or accommodate men.The implication is always, always, always that to get these men in trouble is to, somehow, betray them. And by betraying them, we are betraying our communities as a whole. It feeds into the false narrative that black women are endlessly strong. This narrative is glorified. And it is dangerous. It strips black women of their right to be vulnerable, our right to be weak, our right to ask for help, and our right to challenge abuse.The parallels between the events in ""Confirmation"" and sexual abuse cases involving black men today are uncanny. In 2016, there are people still espousing conspiracy theories about the rape allegations against Bill Cosby, R. Kelly, and more recently Afrika Bambaataa. These people scrutinize the alleged victims of these men more than they do the men themselves. They remind us how these men have done so much for the community, as if their legacies are more important than the lives and the trauma wrought upon their many victims. But like the victims in these cases, what Anita Hill was trying to do in 1991 was get justice for herself and other women abused by Clarence Thomas, not ""bring down another good black man.""Solidarity between black men and black women is important, perhaps now more than ever. But speaking out against abuse of any kind, if that abuse is being perpetrated by a black man, isn't about bashing black men as a whole or bringing good black men down. Black women should not have to compartmentalize their identities in the interest of others. Using race as a way to dismiss sexism against black women does not combat racism. All it does is silence the voices and diminish the experiences of black women. As Anita Hill's actions showed, it's the system that's messed up, not the black women who ask that black men be held accountable for their transgressions. The fact that Thomas, or Cosby, or R. Kelly are put under scrutiny for their actions isn't racist. The fact that many white men in power aren't put under an equal amount of scrutiny is.To silence black women instead of calling out that disparity is simply to perpetuate the scary, dangerous idea that black women's voices don't matter -- not even on Capitol Hill.

The pressure of knowing one could be responsible for toppling everything a man like Thomas has achieved, is the kind of pressure that echoes throughout the lives of so many black women, during moments when they've felt the need to change or silence or hide themselves in order to protect or accommodate men.The implication is always, always, always that to get these men in trouble is to, somehow, betray them. And by betraying them, we are betraying our communities as a whole. It feeds into the false narrative that black women are endlessly strong. This narrative is glorified. And it is dangerous. It strips black women of their right to be vulnerable, our right to be weak, our right to ask for help, and our right to challenge abuse.The parallels between the events in ""Confirmation"" and sexual abuse cases involving black men today are uncanny. In 2016, there are people still espousing conspiracy theories about the rape allegations against Bill Cosby, R. Kelly, and more recently Afrika Bambaataa. These people scrutinize the alleged victims of these men more than they do the men themselves. They remind us how these men have done so much for the community, as if their legacies are more important than the lives and the trauma wrought upon their many victims. But like the victims in these cases, what Anita Hill was trying to do in 1991 was get justice for herself and other women abused by Clarence Thomas, not ""bring down another good black man.""Solidarity between black men and black women is important, perhaps now more than ever. But speaking out against abuse of any kind, if that abuse is being perpetrated by a black man, isn't about bashing black men as a whole or bringing good black men down. Black women should not have to compartmentalize their identities in the interest of others. Using race as a way to dismiss sexism against black women does not combat racism. All it does is silence the voices and diminish the experiences of black women. As Anita Hill's actions showed, it's the system that's messed up, not the black women who ask that black men be held accountable for their transgressions. The fact that Thomas, or Cosby, or R. Kelly are put under scrutiny for their actions isn't racist. The fact that many white men in power aren't put under an equal amount of scrutiny is.To silence black women instead of calling out that disparity is simply to perpetuate the scary, dangerous idea that black women's voices don't matter -- not even on Capitol Hill.

Australians can now get the big-screen experience under the stars, all from the comfort of a double bed. Mov’In Bed (short for “movie in bed”), an outdoor film festival offering the movie-in-bed experience, is currently running for two weeks in Sydney through April 23. Organizers have plans to take it on the road throughout Australia next, the festival’s creator and producer, Vincent Hernandez, told The Huffington Post.“It’s all about the experience,” Hernandez said in an email. “We created the idea of the beds because it’s fun, romantic and unusual -- and because when you watch a movie in a park you break your neck using your backpack as a pillow and start to get cold sitting on the grass.”General admission gets ticketholders a spot on an inflatable bed (a single ticket for a single bed, or two tickets for a double) and clean sheets and a blanket for when the temperature starts to drop. Moviegoers can order wine, beer or Champagne from their beds during the movie. And an adjacent food festival offers an eclectic spread of global cuisine from paellas to crepes to gourmet fish and chips from a variety of local vendors. “It’s a crazy idea -- the logistics and risk of rain makes it almost impossible,” Hernandez said. “But we found a way to make the beds waterproof so people can still enjoy movies even in a light rain. Pure romance!” The festival, in Prince Alfred Park, features a different film each night. Among those on the international lineup: ""Muriel's Wedding"" (Australia), ""Where Do We Go Now?"" (Lebanon), ""Saving Grace"" (England), ""Ponyo"" (Japan), and ""Into The Wild"" (U.S.).All 100 tickets for each screening sold out within two weeks of becoming available, Hernandez said.While sleep experts may not condone the big screen before bedtime -- or doing anything other than sleeping in bed to begin with -- the experience might be worth the splurge if a festival like this comes to town.Sarah DiGiulio is The Huffington Post’s sleep reporter.

Pinkett said Trump ""is not worthy of the highest office of the land."" He said there were glimpses of those attitudes in private conversations and time spent off-screen with Trump during the making of the TV show.Running for 14 seasons, ""The Apprentice"" gave Trump a national platform. His often blunt and unfiltered style helped make the show a major hit. The show featured groups of business-minded contestants vying for a titular apprenticeship in Trump's organization. At its peak, nearly 21 million people watched the show.Trump's proposals to ban Muslims and build a wall at the Mexican border have drawn criticism even within his party. His campaign has been accused of tacitly encouraging violence at large and rowdy rallies where Trump supporters have at times clashed with protesters.Pinkett told Reuters he had contacted former ""apprentices"" and said their effort was independent and timed to precede a crucial nominating contest on Tuesday in New York. At the news conference, Pinkett was joined by former ""Apprentice"" contestants Tara Dowdell and Kwame Jackson; Marshawn Evans Daniels participated via video link.'FAILING WANNABES'It seemed unlikely their effort would dent Trump's comfortable advantage in New York opinion polls against rivals Ohio Governor John Kasich and U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas.In response, Trump dismissed his former aspiring protégés on Friday as ""failing wannabes out of hundreds of contestants.""""How quickly they forget. Nobody would know who they are if it weren't for me,"" he said in a statement. ""They just want to get back into the limelight like they had when they were with Trump. Total dishonesty and disloyalty.""Trump pulled ahead of Cruz and Kasich this week in the national Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll. Among Republicans, 45 percent support Trump, compared with 29 percent for Cruz and 21 percent for Kasich. Meanwhile, Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are tied at 47 percent. The poll had a credibility interval of 4.6 percentage points.NEW YORK POST ENDORSEMENTIn an apparent bid to establish a more presidential footing, Trump turned from his usual platform of Twitter to the opinion pages of The Wall Street Journal to denounce the Republican National Committee over a nomination process he said was rigged.Friday's piece, along with an endorsement by the tabloid New York Post, signaled a possible detente with media magnate Rupert Murdoch, whose company News Corp owns both newspapers. A News Corp spokesman declined to comment on the relationship between the two billionaires.Murdoch took to Twitter last year to denounce Trump's comments that many illegal immigrants from Mexico were bringing crime to the United States, tweeting: ""Trump wrong."" The Journal in July called Trump a ""catastrophe"" in a withering editorial.Trump on Wednesday met privately with Fox News Channel anchor Megyn Kelly after a feud that had lasted months. Murdoch's company 21st Century Fox owns the channel.NBC, the network for ""The Apprentice,"" cut ties with Trump last year as he rose to the top of opinion polls with his descriptions of some Mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists. Trump’s other well-known NBC venture, the Miss USA pageant and Miss Universe pageants, was also dropped from the line-up around that time.Other ""Apprentice"" contestants have backed Trump, including actors Stephen Baldwin, Gary Busey and Lou Ferrigno, former basketball star Dennis Rodman and reality television star Jesse James.But in remarks directed at Trump, Pinkett said, ""I am calling, we are calling, for you to do better.""(Additional reporting by Chris Kahn in New York, Bill Trott in Washington; Writing by Alana Wise and Doina Chiacu; Editing by Howard Goller)"

Donna Edwards (D-Md.) is black.,2016-04-15,Donna Edwards is in a tight primary race with Chris Van Hollen for an open Senate seat. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5710e55b220000360025399f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A white Republican lobbyist has been giving money to Democratic Senate candidate Rep. Donna Edwards (D-Md.), who is African-American, because, the lobbyist says, the Senate's not diverse enough. Sam Geduldig first gave $200 to the Edwards campaign last year, an amount too low to appear on federal campaign finance documents. But now he's giving more. ""I was lobbying the Senate the other day and I noticed Cory Booker was the only black Democrat,"" Geduldig told The Huffington Post in an email, referring to the Democratic senator from New Jersey. ""The institution needs diverse senators, like the House. That's why I am contributing.""Geduldig served as a top aide to former House Speaker John Boehner before switching to the private sector in 2007. With a $400 donation on Thursday (for which he shared an email receipt with HuffPost), Geduldig said his total giving to the Edwards campaign has topped out at $800 so far.""I think the Senate is broken and I think the reason the Senate is broken is there's no diversity,"" Geduldig said. ""I think the only way it will work is if there's more diversity in the Democratic caucus.""An Edwards campaign spokesman said he didn't have much to say about the donations, other than to ""agree that we believe the Senate needs more diversity and the perspective of someone like Donna Edwards.""Edwards is in a tight race with Rep. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) for the Senate seat being vacated by Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D). Van Hollen, a longtime member of House Democratic leadership, is white.Other than Booker, the only Democratic members of the Senate who aren't white are Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.). Minorities among Senate Republicans include Tim Scott (S.C.), Ted Cruz (Texas) and Marco Rubio (Fla.). On the House side, however, white men actually make up a minority of Democratic members. Republican lawmakers are mostly white men in both the House and Senate.Geduldig considers the House more functional than the Senate, though diversity in the House Democratic caucus has not helped the lower chamber pass a budget so far this year. A type of basic functionality known as ""regular order"" has eluded both chambers for most of the last several years. Geduldig is a partner in the lobbying and PR firm CGCN Group, representing a range of corporate and banking clients. He's donated $635,400 to political candidates, PACs and party committees over the past 12 years. The only reported contribution that went to a Democrat was a $250 donation to Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis.) in 2013. At the time, Moore was the head of the Congressional Black Caucus and a powerful member of the House Financial Services Committee.Geduldig has also donated $3,000 to HuffPost's crowdfunding campaign supporting a full-time reporter position in Ferguson, Missouri. Geduldig said he made the donations because HuffPost isn't diverse enough, either. Geduldig's crusade on behalf of greater diversity in the media and in the Democratic Party is not new. For years, he has missed few opportunities to remind reporters at the New York Times, MSNBC, HuffPost, Politico, The Wall Street Journal and elsewhere that criticism of Republicans for lacking diversity is coming from glass houses. Now, it seems, he's putting his money where his mouth has been."

25,POLITICS,MacArthur Foundation Bails Out Jurisdictions That Jail Too Many,Ryan J. Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/macarthur-foundation-jail-reform_us_570d42efe4b01422324a5d88,Eleven places will each get at least $1 million to reduce their jail population.,2016-04-15,"The Rikers Island jail complex in New York houses some 10,000 inmates on any given day.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/570d57d01e0000b300706dad.jpeg?cache=ldnYwszpgB&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The MacArthur Foundation named the jurisdictions this week to which it will distribute millions of dollars in an effort aimed at reducing jail populations.The number of people held in American jails has tripled over the past few decades. Many people stay locked up ahead of their court date simply because they can't afford to pay bail. The Chicago-based foundation sees jails as the starting point in the country's cycle of over-incarceration and therefore the place to begin decreasing the numbers.Eleven different jurisdictions will receive between $1.5 million and $3.5 million each over a period of two years as part of MacArthur's Safety and Justice Challenge. The initiative launched last year when a larger group received smaller sums to develop reform plans.The recipients of the latest grants range from major cities like New York to more rural locations like Pima County, Arizona. Several of the recipients -- such as Charleston County in South Carolina, which includes North Charleston, and St. Louis County in Missouri, which includes Ferguson -- have come under heavy scrutiny in recent years following high-profile police killings.Also on the list for million-plus grants are New Orleans; Philadelphia; Harris County, Texas; Lucas County, Ohio; Milwaukee County, Wisconsin; Spokane County, Washington; and the state of Connecticut. Nine other jurisdictions will receive $150,000 grants and access to experts to help them keep up their reform efforts.In Charleston County, where an average 70 percent of the daily jail population are sitting behind bars awaiting their court dates, many of them simply because they can't afford bail, authorities will receive $2.25 million to reduce that population over three years. Officials will work to cut the numbers by such tactics as issuing citations for some low-level offenses and screening for poor individuals whose bond would be set at only a nominal amount in any case.“The basic premise is we’re going to provide the right services to the appropriate folks we run into on the street, and for the folks that do come to jail, we’re going to make sure that money is not the only reason that you’re staying in jail,"" said Assistant Sheriff Mitch Lucas. The 32-year law enforcement veteran said the grants will give his office the opportunity to implement changes he would've liked to make years ago.Lucas said he's been in regular communication with community interests, including representatives of the Black Lives Matter movement and the NAACP, since the death of Walter Scott last spring. Scott was shot and killed by a police officer in North Charleston when he ran from a traffic stop. Former officer Michael Slager has been charged in his death. Scott likely fled because there was a warrant out for his arrest over missed child support payments.""I would like to think that we would’ve found a way for Walter Scott to take care of his responsibilities with the criminal justice system without him seeing the need to flee,"" Lucas said.Some ask whether it makes sense to distribute money to jurisdictions that routinely violate the civil rights of those they have in custody. Thomas Harvey of ArchCity Defenders said the plan to address problems in his area amounted to a ""Band-Aid."" ArchCity Defenders represents indigent individuals locked up for long stretches of time because they couldn't afford the stiff fines and fees levied by St. Louis County's network of municipal courts.St. Louis County will receive $2.25 million from MacArthur. The county's plan reportedly involves training court employees in ""responsiveness and sensitivity"" to the community's needs and creating an app that will give individuals access to information about court dates. Many of the poorest people in the region, Harvey pointed out, don't have smartphones.""Everyone knows the problem is the continued existence of the 81 individual courts that make up the municipal court system. Instead of tinkering around and making surface-level changes to address problems that arose as a result of this system, get rid of the system,"" Harvey said. ""Consolidate the courts and create a regional, professional, full-time court system that follows the Constitution instead of pretending like poor people are criminals who need to be taught a lesson or otherwise punished for their poverty.""Laurie Garduque, director of justice reform at the MacArthur Foundation, said that her organization purposefully chose jurisdictions that have deep problems but where politicians, law enforcement leaders and the judiciary have bought in to the push for reform. “We made a conscious decision to pick tough places, because those are the places that needed reform,” Garduque said. The foundation will be able to keep up the pressure on the jurisdictions and hold them accountable, she said.“We’ll continue to support them as long as they have demonstrable effect. In turn, we’re going to press them and encourage them to tackle some of the underlying structural issues that advocates are concerned about,” said Garduque. Moreover, she said, MacArthur's involvement means “there’s not going to be a way to cover up or not talk about their failures if they bump into those along the way.”While many of the plans developed by the various cities and counties share characteristics, they are also specific to each community. Philadelphia is home to an overcrowded jail facility, visited by Pope Francis last year, where many inmates remain incarcerated only because they cannot afford bail. The city will receive $3.5 million in part to screen out those individuals who pose little risk to the community as they await trial.In Pima County, the justice system has been strained by the Great Recession, and authorities say the money to implement reforms simply wasn't available. There have been times in recent years when the jail exceeded capacity and individuals had to sleep on mattresses on the floor in communal areas.“Budgets are extremely tight here,” said Ellen Wheeler, assistant county administrator for Pima County. “This grant is really making a difference and allowing us to be creative and try some new approaches.""Wheeler noted that a ""very sizable percentage"" of the jail population is behind bars awaiting a court date on a charge that likely wouldn't result in incarceration. “Most of them are for misdemeanor offenses they wouldn’t be jailed for, they wouldn’t be held, because they were such low-level offenses,"" she said.New York City isn't facing the same kind of budget issues, and it has already undertaken an effort to lower its jail population. So the MacArthur money will be dedicated toward very specific purposes. One project is to create a public website that breaks down how many people are in jail for what purposes, with the hopes of identifying ways to streamline the system.“It comes down to kind of deconstructing everyone in our jail system to sort of understand why they’re there,"" said Elizabeth Glazer, director of the Mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice. She said gathering all the data in a website could ""demystify why people are there and how long it takes to go through the system, and what effect certain reforms have.""The city will also create a means by which jailhouse officials can efficiently alert court officers as to which defendants will actually be coming to court that day. “It’s so simple, and yet that by itself is a huge driver of the delay,” Glazer said.Getting an overall picture of New York's vast system should help officials identify other solutions. For instance, does a courthouse need private spaces where defendants can meet with their lawyers before a court appearance, which could avoid the need to ask for continuances, which in turn could lead to less time spent in jail?“There are all kinds of things that contribute to delay that really require getting under the sink with a wrench to understand it. It’s not sexy, it’s not sound-biteable, but it’s absolutely critical to add all of those things up,” Glazer said.Reducing the length of jail stays is the main goal.“We think that's where we’re getting our biggest bang for the buck... shortening the amount of time people stay,"" Glazer said. ""Everything after that we should do because it reduces the jail population and because it’s a matter of fairness.”Editor's note: Authorities in one of the jurisdictions that received a grant, St. Louis County, are currently prosecuting the author of this story and a Washington Post reporter for alleged ordinance violations stemming from their arrests in Ferguson in August 2014."

Donald Trump’s polling numbers seem okay in the primary, but abysmal in the general election. And a research company is experimenting with polling people who dial wrong numbers. This is HuffPollster for Friday, April 15, 2016.VOTERS ARE UNLIKELY TO RALLY BEHIND A THIRD PARTY CANDIDATE - Matt Dabrowski (R): ""Pollsters regularly ask about third-party support, often in one of two ways. One way is to ask voters if they’d support a third-party candidate in some kind of yes-no question….Another way is to add the third-party candidate to the general-election horse race question….Pollsters know that both these question styles aren’t very predictive….But there is a way to accurately gauge potential third-party support using survey research…. A potential third-party voter must reject both the Republicans and Democrats (1,2) and both the Republican and Democrat nominees (3,4). In effect, voters have to say ‘no’ four times before they’re truly open to stepping outside the two-party system, making this a four-part test….This potential pool of third-party support will wax and wane with the nominees’ favorables. And the odds are that disgruntled primary voters today will become loyal partisans in November."" [HuffPost]Post-election analysis confirms that polling non-major party candidates is tough - A comparison of polling and actual results in the 2014 midterms, presented last year by exit pollster Joe Lenksi, found that if pollsters included the third candidate in their election tossup questions, the numbers overestimated support for that candidate. If they didn’t ask about the third candidate, though, the polls underestimated the vote share. The bottom line: it's very difficult to poll on independent and third-party candidates. [HuffPost]REPUBLICANS ARE LESS SURE ABOUT VOTING IF THEY DON’T LIKE THE NOMINEE - Mark Blumenthal: ""Seven out of ten registered voters (70%) describe themselves as 'absolutely certain' to vote on a Trump-Clinton contest, with 80% at least 'very likely' to vote. Slightly fewer (67%) say they are 'absolutely certain' to vote if Clinton faces a Republican other than Trump, with 81 percent at least 'very likely' to vote. However, these overall results mask shifting preferences among about a quarter of registered voters, with potentially important consequences for the ultimate Republican nominee….[A] quarter of Donald Trump’s backers (25%) rate their chances of voting as 50–50 or less if he is not the nominee, while a similar share of Cruz and Kasich supporters (24 and 27% respectively) say they are 50–50 or less if Trump gets the nod. Under either scenario—Trump or another Republican as nominee—the results reverse the usual pattern by party. Typically, the most likely voters are slightly more Republican than other registered voters. In this case, however, the potential hesitance of either Trump or #NeverTrump voters gives Democrats a slight edge on self-reported vote likelihood under either hypothetical scenario."" [SurveyMonkey] TRUMP’S POLLING NUMBERS ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY AWFUL AND OKAY - Greg Sargent (D): “The basic case for nominating Ted Cruz rather than Donald Trump is that, while Cruz would arguably be the most right-wing nominee in modern American history, and would probably lose to Hillary Clinton, he would not unleash the sort of blood-dimmed tide of down-ticket destruction that Trump would. A new Washington Post/ABC News poll lends some support to this view: It finds that Trump’s numbers are unspeakably awful among all the voter groups that Republican strategists had hoped to improve the party’s performance among in 2016.” [WashPost]... But on the other hand - Philip Bump: “[A] new CBS News poll suggests that Republicans are pretty comfortable with the idea of Trump as the nominee -- or, at least, they are compared to the other two candidates….Republicans are slightly more likely to say that they would support Trump's nomination 'enthusiastically' than they were last month. Overall, two-thirds of Republicans say they'd support him enthusiastically or with some reservations -- a higher percentage than says that about Cruz or Gov. John Kasich. More Republicans are likely to say they'd support Kasich simply because he would be the nominee than any other reason.” [WashPost]So which is it -- do Trump’s numbers show “unspeakably awful” or “pretty comfortable”? - Both are true. Trump’s numbers are awful among the general public and the minority groups that are discussed in Sargent’s piece. Among just Republicans -- the group Bump is discussing -- his support has declined overall, but his favorability ratings are higher than either of his opponents. The two pieces and the polls they discuss highlight a substantial gap between how Republican voters and general election voters feel about Trump and his potential nomination‘RECONNECT’ POLLING ROUTES WRONG NUMBERS TO POLLS - Eric Chemi and Nicholas Wells: ""Reconnect Research works with technology that accepts inbound calls and turns them into research and polling opportunities. One problem with traditional polling is it depends on respondents answering calls from unknown numbers and using landlines. With cellphones and caller ID, most people won't answer their phone if a random person or unknown number is calling. People hardly pick up landlines at all. However, people still have to call important numbers like banks, insurance or credit card companies. When people call those numbers and misdial, Reconnect can send that call to a researcher….Reconnect Research has been continuing to prove out its thesis. One example of this — the results of the Florida primary. Reconnect's polling was the most accurate in measuring Democrat Hillary Clinton's performance...Similarly for John Kasich's number. Reconnect's poll was number one out of 10 polls analyzed."" [CNBC] It’s hard to assess claims of accuracy on polling released after the election - It doesn’t appear that the Reconnect Research polls were publicly released prior to the elections in Florida. As with any new way of doing polls, skepticism is warranted until there’s evidence that the method performs well over time.HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

Polio remains endemic in Pakistan after the Taliban banned vaccinations, attacks targeted medical staffers and suspicions lingered about the inoculations. (AP Photo/Shakil Adil)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"LONDON, April 15 (Reuters) - In a huge immunisation effort in 150 countries, health teams will on Sunday launch what they hope will be the final push against polio.Stopping transmission of the contagious viral disease that has infected millions is possible within a year, experts say. And full, official, global eradication could be declared by the end of this decade.First, however, the vaccine that has successfully fought polio for more than 30 years needs to be switched for one that targets the last few areas of risk.It won't be easy, or cheap, but the World Health Organization's director of polio eradication, Michel Zaffran, says failure now - when there have only been 12 cases worldwide this year, in Pakistan and Afghanistan - means the virus could spread across borders again.Success would make polio only the second human disease to be eradicated since smallpox was banished in 1980.""Taking our foot off the pedal now could mean polio will within a few years spread straight back into large parts of the world and create 100,000 or 200,000 cases,"" Zaffran told Reuters.

""We're entering into uncharted territory. This has never been done before. But there's no going back now.""That's partly because polio vaccine manufacturers - among them France's Sanofi Pasteur - have moved production to the bivalent shot and would find it tricky, costly, and time-consuming to reverse that move.Anil Dutta, a vaccine expert at British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline, which also makes polio shots, is looking beyond eradication to 2019 or 2020, when all ""live"" oral polio vaccines need to be discontinued.Then the world will switch again, to ""inactivated"" polio vaccine, or IPV, to further reduce any risk of causing disease through immunisation. Scaling up IPV production to meet the needs of the entire world takes years, he warns, and work must start now to avoid potential supply concerns.HISTORY OF MISSESBut prediction has never been easy in the fight to wipe out polio, and health authorities have missed targets along the way.The Global Polio Eradication Initiative, launched in 1988, originally aimed to end all transmission of the disease by 2000.And while there has been a 99 percent reduction in cases worldwide since the GPEI launch, fighting the last 1 percent of polio has been far tougher than expected.In 2013, the GPEI said the global fight against polio would require $5.5 billion in funding, and more will be needed beyond that to keep a lid on the disease.The virus, which invades the nervous system and can cause irreversible paralysis within hours, spreads rapidly among children, especially in unsanitary conditions in war-torn regions, refugee camps and areas where healthcare is limited.In Pakistan and Afghanistan, the last two countries where polio currently remains endemic, conflict and propaganda have hampered progress, and in the past posed risks to others.The campaign to eliminate polio in Pakistan is fraught with risk, with Islamist militants attacking health teams they accuse of being Western spies.

After being declared polio-free by World Health Organization officials in 2014, Indonesia is observing National Polio Immunization Week by vowing to inoculate millions of children. The expanded mass immunization drive against polio and measles began simultaneously. The polio immunization drive is targeting children aged 9 to 59 months old, and that for measles infants nine month to 59 month old.

And full, official, global eradication could be declared by the end of this decade.First, however, the vaccine that has successfully fought polio for more than 30 years needs to be switched for one that targets the last few areas of risk.It won't be easy, or cheap, but the World Health Organization's director of polio eradication, Michel Zaffran, says failure now - when there have only been 12 cases worldwide this year, in Pakistan and Afghanistan - means the virus could spread across borders again.Success would make polio only the second human disease to be eradicated since smallpox was banished in 1980.""Taking our foot off the pedal now could mean polio will within a few years spread straight back into large parts of the world and create 100,000 or 200,000 cases,"" Zaffran told Reuters.
