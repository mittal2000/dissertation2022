So I was really interested to hear that American Airlines is now offering baggage delivery to its passengers. They are the first carrier in the US to offer this service and they are partnering with BAGS VIP Luggage Delivery in order to provide it. American Airlines is promising its passengers that within four hours of arrival, their luggage will be delivered to their home, office or hotel, as long as it's within 40 miles of the airport. (Anything over 41 miles and under 100 miles requires six hours and costs an additional $1 per mile.)The cost is $29.95 for one bag, $39.95 for two and $49.95 for three to ten. This charge is on top of the checked luggage fees that American Airlines already has in place. Up to two hours prior to their flight, passengers can book luggage delivery at the airport. Or, they can book it in advance online at www.aa.com.More than 200 U.S. domestic airports and select international Pre-Clearance cities will have this service seven days a week, including holidays. And America Airlines says that bags will be specially tagged when they are checked in so that the delivery folks can identify and deliver them as quickly as possible.   American Airlines recently tested this service with Holland America Cruise ships and is reporting the following passenger feedback:""The BAGS VIP Luggage Delivery service was everything that was promised. We would definitely use this service again.""""It made the return home from our cruise so easy. It was worth every penny it cost."" ""Your follow up with time of delivery to our home was impressive; the cost is reasonable and best of all, of course, is not having to ""mess with"" finding luggage ...Thank you for a job well done."""

The company has set money aside to refund customers, the report said. On Monday, CFPB spokeswoman Moira Vahey said the disclosure by American Express does not necessarily mean the company will be penalized or refund customers' money. She said the bureau does not comment on pending investigations. A spokeswoman from American Express said, ""The discussions with regulators are confidential and we have not announced anything beyond what we said in the 10Q."" Bank of America also disclosed in its quarterly filing that it received queries from regulators regarding identity-theft products it offers cardholders. Discover Financial Services expects to face the CFPB regarding its sales of add-ons too, the Wall Street Journal reported.The latest disclosures from some of the nation's biggest credit card companies reveal the teeth of the year-old government bureau. In July, the CFPB ordered Capital One Bank to refund customers $140 million for deceptive advertising of add-on credit card products. Credit card add-ons like payment insurance, identity theft alerts or credit monitoring are lucrative up-sells for credit card companies, and mean hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue each year. Discover Financial reportedly made $300 million in 2009 on the sale of add-ons, according to a report from the Minnesota attorney general's office. But some credit card experts said a crackdown on add-on products will only mean new customer fees, such as new costs to redeem rewards points. ""[Credit card companies] are not going to sit on the sidelines and take a punch to the bottom line without trying to offset revenue,"" said Curtis Arnold, founder of CardRatings.com, a credit card consumer education and comparison website.Consumer advocates have long complained that these products mislead consumers, and rope them into fees they did not intend to sign up for and result in products with little meaningful value.""[These add-on products] often have terms that make it sound like something you can't live without,"" said Linda Sherry, director of national priorities of Consumer Action, a consumer advocacy group. ""Very few people understand that this [results in a recurring] fee and unless you're watching your account closely, it will continue to bill.""Several states have tried to take on credit card companies themselves. In April, Hawaii sued seven banks over deceptive marketing of payment protection services. West Virginia settled with Capital One for $13.5 million in January 2012, and Minnesota sued Discover at the end of 2010.The bureau released a bulletin last month detailing its expectations surrounding advertising and marketing of add-on products, including clear terms and conditions, and forbidding credit card employee compensation from being tied to the sale of these products.Since June 19, when the CFPB's new credit card database opened to the public, at least 100 new consumer complaints about credit card protection programs or company marketing have been logged. There have been more than 2,561 complaints logged since the database was made public in June."

Golden Gate Bridge officials are preparing to unveil a proposal to bring corporate sponsorship to the world famous span to help pay down an $80 million deficit. Officials say that no advertising will be on the bridge itself, but will be prominent on benches, garbage cans and park facilities.

Well what if you really did walk around naked where mostly everyone else is dressed? It can happen in The Castro neighborhood in San Francisco.San Francisco has a long history of being tolerant of birthday suits. The city hosts a number of famous events many of which have a clothing optional element every year. One of the most famous is the Bay to Breakers Race held in May every year. It just celebrated it's 100th anniversary last year. Depending on weather, from 50,000-100,000 people participate. It's very much a party atmosphere. About half the runners wear costumes. When the weather is nice, thousands run or walk nude. The annual Pride Parade in June has around 500,000 attendees many of whom wear nude-themed costumes.The Folsom Street Fair is held in September every year and will have around 400,000 attendees. Nudity is very common at this event.Finally, the World Naked Bike Ride is held every June. Nude recreation is so popular in northern California that the San Francisco Bay Guardian publishes an annual clothing optional beach guide.San Gregorio Beach, which is located about 20 miles south of San Francisco, is the first official nude beach in the U.S starting back in 1967. The City of San Francisco has three nude beaches. Baker Beach in the Golden Gate National Recreation Area is the most famous. On clear days, it has fantastic views of the Golden Gate Bridge and Marin county. My wife and I went there on Monday, July 30. Although the weather was a little foggy, and it was midweek, there were around 25 nude regulars and tourists. We learned on a warm, sunny weekend day, there will be upwards of a few hundred skinny dippers relaxing on this beautiful beach. The view here is breath-taking. Travel writer Mary Moore Mason says, ""The Golden Gate Bridge's daily strip tease from enveloping stoles of mist to full frontal glory is still the most provocative show in town."" We agree.How about urban nudity? San Francisco does not have a law against being naked in public. In 2010, a small urban park was created at Castro, Market and 17th Streets. Almost immediately, neighborhood nudists started to use this park. Last fall, national news was made when city supervisor Scott Wiener proposed a law requiring nudists to sit on towels.You've heard the expression, ""when in Rome do as the Romans do."" Naturally, I had to join in with the nudists of The Castro. At lunchtime, we joined regulars Craig, Robert and Lloyd plus a few other people including a tourist from Kansas City enjoying the warm San Francisco day wearing just their smiles. I learned the regulars eat lunch at this small park everyday (weather permitting). Usually from 10-15 people are relaxing here on any given weekday -- on weekends, you'll find maybe 40-50 people. Almost everyone including the local business community are very positive and friendly towards the nudists. One of the reasons is the nudists I met were very likeable and friendly, too.Vacationing in San Francisco, it's very easy to leave both your heart and clothes there."

I see strength that reaches far beyond physical. I see potential bursting through preconceived boundaries and I see unending capabilities and power. This is my fitness. Realizing true potential through the simple act of exercise.While Olympic athletes seem to be superhuman, they all started as regular people who decided to make a firm commitment to training. If you are like me, when the torch marches across continents, there is a surge of inspiration that pours out from the Olympic coverage. Stories of lifelong hardship, impossible training conditions and unthinkable comebacks inspire us to do more with our lives. But before you start hurdling park benches and pole-vaulting over the dog, here are a few points to keep in mind. Being an an Olympic athlete is a full-time job. Inspiration is great, but dedication and consistency are more important when it comes to winning a gold medal. As an example, Olympic triathlete Jonny Brownlee trains about eight hours a day. Besides the daily time commitment, it's common for athletes to invest four to eight years training in a sport before making an Olympic team. Most of us struggle to find one hour out of our day to exercise, and hardly know what we are doing next Friday. So where does that leave your aspiring inner athlete? Lesson One: Make a Plan The first thing you need to do is make a plan. Unless you are a career athlete, making a plan will be a bit more challenging than you think. The best thing you can do for yourself is hire a trainer. It will make you accountable and consistent. Think of a trainer as an investment in yourself. A good trainer will put together a program designed specifically with your goals in mind. Olympic cyclist Kristin Armstrong has said that she believes, ""One of the best things I did for myself was hire a coach,"" because he helped her focus on things she wasn't good at, allowing her to be a well-rounded athlete. Lesson Two: CommitmentYou can always exercise tomorrow, right? Without a concrete schedule, exercise will inevitably take a backseat to happy hour, an extra hour of sleep or the office. Your workout routine will grow into a habit, but the schedule needs to be nurtured and reinforced. If you calendar starts to fail you, try working out with a friend. The added commitment of another person will keep you on track. The time working out can double as a venting session about your annoying boss, or it can be an opportunity to get closer with someone who caught your eye. (I can let you in on a little secret -- exercise can be a huge turn-on. Don't believe me? Just ask my boyfriend. He gave me one piggy-back and I was sold.)Lesson Three: Be Consistent Once your plan is in place and the workouts are scheduled, all you need to do is be consistent. Half of the battle of exercise is showing up. Even a bad workout is still a workout. Your routine builds on itself. If you skip a week or two it might not set you back to square one, but it will require a re-start. You want to carry momentum throughout the year so that you only move forward. There will be days or even weeks that you just do not want to exercise. Even Olympic gymnast Alicia Sacramone says she has ""days when I really don't want to do anything, but I make it a point to do something physical every day.""In the words of Aristotle, ""We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.""Let's take these lessons as a base for building a Summer Olympics training program. You may have to wait till 2016 to show off your skills, but I created routines to get you started. Over the next few weeks, I will outline themed exercise routines based on our favorite Olympic events. While the workouts might not turn us back into prepubescent gymnasts, it will get us off the couch and into the spirit of the games.For more by Stacy Berman, click here.For more on fitness and exercise, click here."

He is charged with 24 counts of first-degree murder and 116 counts of attempted murder.In most court cases, documents are available to the public, but Judge William Sylvester sealed the Holmes case on July 20 at the request of prosecutors. Major media organizations have asked the judge to unseal the documents, citing the public's right of access.Sylvester has set a hearing for Thursday to decide whether to do so. He has asked prosecutors to respond to the motion by Monday and Holmes's lawyers by Thursday, according to an attorney for the media companies.Among the documents the media want to see are affidavits that law enforcement officers would have filed before arresting Holmes, which would show why the officers thought that Holmes was the shooter.The media companies also want to see the prosecutors' motion to seal the case, other motions that have been referenced in court, plus two defense motions ""that we don't know what they are about at all,"" a lawyer for the media companies, Steven Zansberg of Levine Sullivan Koch & Schulz, said in an email.It is unclear whether prosecutors or Holmes' attorney will oppose the media's request.In similar cases, the government often raises concerns that making certain documents public would jeopardize an ongoing investigation. Defendants, meanwhile, often raise privacy concerns and the fear that pretrial publicity would jeopardize their right to a fair trial. Judges may also lean toward sealing such cases out of respect for victims and their families.A representative of Arapahoe County District Attorney Carol Chambers said her office is not commenting on the case. Douglas Wilson, a court-appointed attorney for Holmes, did not return a call seeking comment. PUBLIC'S RIGHT OF ACCESSIn their motion, the media companies argued that Sylvester's order ""violates the public's constitutional right of access to the records of criminal prosecutions, and undermines our nation's firm commitment to the transparency and public accountability of the criminal justice system.""The outlets that filed the motion include The Associated Press, ABC Inc, Bloomberg LP, The Denver Post, and The New York Times Co. Thomson Reuters was not part of the motion.The media companies cited a Colorado Supreme Court case that adopted American Bar Association standards governing public access to criminal court records.Under those standards, the media companies argued, public access can only be denied when there is a ""clear and present danger to the administration of justice, or to some equally compelling governmental interest, and no alternative exists to adequately protect that interest.""It is up to Sylvester to weigh the competing interests. But law and precedent require that judges start with the presumption that all court records should be open to the public, according to experts.""You don't have a presumption of sealing,"" said Jonathan Sherman, an attorney at the law firm Boies, Schiller & Flexner who has worked for media companies. ""You have a presumption of openness.""In addition to sealing court records, Sylvester also sealed the court docket, which lists what documents have been filed in connection to the case. ""We don't know how many other documents are in the court file because there is no public docket,"" said Zansberg, the attorney for the media companies.Legal experts said the move is highly unusual.""You can't even see the progress of the case and make an assessment of what should be unsealed,"" said Thomas Julin, an attorney at the law firm Hunton & Williams who has represented media companies in disputes over access to court records.The media has recently been successful in getting some documents unsealed in the case of Jared Loughner, who was charged last year in a deadly shooting spree that gravely wounded Representative Gabrielle Giffords.As the Holmes case gets further under way, there may be other parties who express concerns over what is sealed. Julin of Hunton & Williams said attorneys representing victims of the families may insist that certain photographs from the crime scene not be released.The issue was raised in the death penalty phase of Danny Rolling, who admitted to killing five students in Gainesville, Florida, in 1990. In that case, Julin represented Florida media outlets that opposed a motion by prosecutors to keep pictures and videos from the murder scene under seal. The government request was supported by the parents and siblings of the murder victims, who said their privacy would be violated by the disclosure of the photographs.A compromise was reached that allowed reporters and the public to review the material in the presence a court clerk but prohibited them from reproducing the material.""Some, including the trial judge, thought that having the right to see the photographs was cathartic for the community,"" Julin said.

(AP Photo/Charles Sykes)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5badbe87260000cf00810588.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Performing at a sold out MGM Grand, Las Vegas August 2, 2012, legendary comedian-turned-author, actor, and all-around media conglomerate Steve Harvey called it quits -- from live stand-up performances.Harvey, who has enjoyed a highly successful show business career for nearly 30 years, retired from the thing that brought him fame -- stand-up. During his self-proclaimed final stand-up comedy show, Harvey hit us with what has been his M.O. since his early days -- Leaving Everything Funny On The Stage. True to his lengthy run as one of the nation's most beloved comics, Harvey under-scored his wild romp around comedic bits with some themes that have always managed to come through loud and clear -- themes that speak to the passions of a man who may be a comic, but is certainly no joke.From informing his swan song audience that ""cussin' started with Moses,"" to boldly offering plain-speak about ways to make the alleged triggerman behind the Colorado shooting massacre who now claims amnesia to remember his actions -- via the formation of an ""A$$-Whuppin' committee"" -- Harvey did in his final stand-up show what Harvey has always done: make people laugh, cry and shake the cobwebs off their brains in order to wrestle with the more serious issues of our times.Harvey, author of the national best-selling book-turned-movie, Act Like a Woman, Think Like a Man, shared that he wrote the book as advice for his daughters. Harvey has been giving straight talk advice to his audience for 27-years -- and not only advice on relationships.One of Harvey's recurring themes has been living an honest and sincere life of faith. Never professing to be perfect -- ""Being a Christian is hard; they got too many rules -- on a good day I get seven out of ten."" Harvey has always challenged his audience members to treat others the way they themselves want to be treated -- even while taking the time to laugh about those church seniors who come to service after more than 8 months on the sick and shut in list to sing in the choir. The MGM roared with laughter as he asked, ""Why at 95 do they still have to read out of the hymn book, they should know the songs by now?""""Always encourage your kids; I don't care what kind of crazy ideas they come home with,"" said Harvey, serious as a heart attack, while somehow finding a way to make people laugh at the painful moment in his own childhood when a teacher belittled Harvey's own crazy dream of one day being on TV.Harvey revealed that it was the support of his father during that incident that made all the difference in the world. Thus, it stands to reason that one of Harvey's recurring refrains during his three decades worth of shows has been a call for parents to be parents. Harvey's life off stage reflects this same commitment in a multiplicity of ways, not the least of which is his legendary work with mentoring programs across the U.S. And from that, and other such work, Harvey will still be going full speed ahead. Just don't expect to see him on stage live, cracking jokes.With the feel of a long goodbye, Harvey told his MGM Grand audience, ""People ask, 'Where do you get this stuff from?' I let them know, I just report the news."" And report the news he has -- whether it's sharing stories about personal family issues or old childhood friends like ""Ug,"" or providing side-splitting, behind-the-scenes insights about hosting the game show Family Feud. Harvey also reflected on and thanked those persons who have been by his side in various capacities throughout his lengthy stint in the limelight.""Seeing him up there was nostalgic,"" said Brandi Harvey, commenting on her father's last show. ""I can remember as a child going to see him; my sister and I use to watch my dad perform live, the ups and downs, before he became such a success."" ""People ask me if he is really finished with stand-up. For the most part, he is done when he says he is done. My father is going to be on a different stage via Family Freud, his new talk show, and of course, fans can still enjoy him on his nationally syndicated radio show,"" said the proud daughter.Thus, through it all -- his final live stand-up performance and his entire career, Harvey's audiences could feel his sincere love of children, his appreciation for the opportunities he has been afforded, the hard work he put forth to take advantage of those opportunities, and his undying belief that we as a society can do and be so much better.""I just want to thank everybody for 27 years of love and support and God willing I'll do 27 more, it just won't be at this. But I really just want to thank everyone!"", Steve expressed at the close of his last performance.Harvey will certainly be around in many other shapes and forms. When fans take in a show at comedy stages around the country and wonder where the humor with heart went, they will remember that the great Steve Harvey, one of the original kings of comedy, rocked his last live MIC, August 2, 2012, Las Vegas, Nevada; and he will be missed.Steve Harvey Photo Credit: Lavan Anderson"

We witness a 16 year-old whose confidence in her ability to win a gold medal was central to every vault, every jump, every spring, every step that led her to be the all-round, best female gymnast in the world. As the recipient of the nickname's impact, I wonder what her thoughts are on the use of the flying squirrel nickname? I wonder if there is a generational difference among those who believe it to be negative and those who do not? I wonder if only Blacks think it might be offensive? I wonder if thinking that the term is offensive holds us to a segregated racial past where nicknames were given by dominate culture as yet another way to suppress minorities? I wonder if we limit our imaginations and hold our perspectives hostage by assuming that the term is demeaning instead of assuming we share a global identity and on the global stage of the Olympics there is a level playing field.I have read many tweets from blacks upset about Gabby's hair from individuals who feel that, as Blacks, they have a right to dictate how Gabby must represent us. I have read fewer tweets and Facebook posting about the nickname. Are these comments a distraction to the wonderful accomplishment or are they advocacy for racial justice? Hair comments aside, in my opinion, the answer to whether the nickname is offensive or progressive lies with Gabrielle Douglas. I know there will be disagreement about this and those who believe that she represents all African Americans and is a role model (the same authority from which those who comment about her hair claim as their rationale for speaking out). However, I believe she is first and foremost the individual who gets to say what she finds offensive and what she might find a term of endearment. I do not know what impact the nickname has for her and I will take my cue from her. Those of us from a different generation and who are not on that balance beam, training side by side with her and her coaches and other teammates are in no position to educate her to their intentions. Family members have nicknames; whether or not NBC and other media outlets should use the term should be dictated by Gabby Douglas. We can choose for ourselves not to use the nickname in reference to her (as I have chosen to do) but is this really an issue we should bring to national attention? I believe there are bigger battles to focus on in order to create opportunities for future Gabby Douglas'. Continuing to make this an issue, do we not do the same thing we are accusing the media of -- deflecting from her great accomplishment?Gabby Douglas is an African American young woman, who was raised by a very supportive family, who trusted her development as an athlete to a coach of Chinese descent while she lived with a white family in Iowa, who then went on to win a gold medal and was cheered and celebrated all over the world by people of all races and ages. Nicknames will come and go. This is a time to celebrate diversity as a driver of excellence."
