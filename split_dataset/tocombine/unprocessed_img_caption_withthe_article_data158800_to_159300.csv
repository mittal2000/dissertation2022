The famous sister of Kate is easy to skewer -- as a social climber, a bad writer, a wild partier or an opportunistic lover of the limelight.But as turns out, Pippa knows exactly what people think about her... and she's not so uptight that she can't skewer herself, too. In a recent blog post for the Spectator (she's a blogger too??), Middleton writes about her difficult journey in a recent cross-country ski marathon: What made my rucksack so heavy? Well, I had to pack my Cheltenham fur hat, various other bits of clothing that PR people have sent me, and several signed copies of my book Celebrate. We KNEW IT.No, not really. In fact, it was mostly taken up with various crampons, a harness with karabiner, avalanche probes, snow shovel, ski skins, and the all-important under-thermals.Oh. Wait. Pippa has acknowledged all the gossipy chatter about her before. In her party-planning book, Celebrate, she wrote, ""It is a bit startling to achieve global recognition before the age of 30 on account of your sister, your brother-in-law and your bottom.""Startling indeed -- but not as startling as hearing Pippa speak so candidly about it.

1,WELLNESS,Is There a Formula for Making the Law of Attraction Work for You? You B	+E =T! (Belief + Expectation = Truth),"Donna L., Contributor
Author, ""The Healers Trilogy""",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/law-of-attraction_us_5b9cfd71e4b03a1dcc839223,"The only things holding us back are our repetitive thoughts of doubt and negativity which, with some determination, can completely turn around into repetitive thoughts of possibility, in which we have sole creative control.",2013-04-03,"Girls holding flowers in field in sunlight, California.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cfd712000002d00fdcad8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If you were given the key to unlock access to anything in life, would you use it? Unconsciously, we open ourselves up to life circumstances all the time, good ones and bad ones, but what if we could deliberately create? It would be absolutely amazing, wouldn't it?By being complacent about the all-encompassing law of attraction, we unwittingly allow experiences into our lives by default, experiences that make us unhappy and hold us back. Just like the law of gravity, we may not see it or understand how it works, but the minute we forget it's there, we fall and hit the ground! However, our lives don't have to play out ""randomly"" or be a constant uphill battle. I'm sure you've noticed that some people seem to lead charmed lives. They make it look effortless, but I'm willing to ""BET"" they use a particular strategy -- Belief + Expectation = Truth -- whether they realize it or not. It is a rather short, straightforward equation, yet the ease or difficulty with which it is solved in your own life is entirely up to you. Let's look at step one:Step 1: What You Believe:The ideas that you believe are simply uncontradicted thoughts that you keep thinking over and over and over again. And so you say, ""This is true."" But I ask you, ""Is it really true?"" Is this a belief of yours because your parents believe it, or your friends agree with it, or you hear it on the news every evening during dinner? Does this belief feel good or bad? Does it uplift you or depress you?Your belief system is the foundation for your entire life. Wouldn't you enjoy a better life if you believed you could? Take some time to think about what you believe and why. This activity alone causes a shift in energy that can turn negative ideas into positive ones. When you have a negative, ongoing thought, which has or will become a belief, question it! Do you believe you can own a beautiful home? If not, why? Is it because you've been conditioned to think you don't deserve it, or because the news is telling you that the economy is bad? Here is the issue: External forces that you cannot control are controlling you.  So forget about what is going on outside of you. Focusing on external circumstances only creates excuses and blame, which are never in alignment with those things that make us happy. If we train our brains to regularly think about and feel the positive aspects of life, that higher, happier energy frequency will be a vibrational match to the abundance we desire. The law of attraction is a universal force that is always working, whether we are aware it is or not, and it never yields different from our vibrational frequency. We're constantly receiving from the law of attraction and asking for what we want with our vibration, so why not get what we want?Begin taking negative beliefs you hold and flipping them to their positive opposites. Think those new, positive thoughts over and over and over again until they become your dominant beliefs. This may take a while -- again, the equation can be easy or difficult for you depending on your willingness to let go of the negative beliefs you have about yourself and the world around you. You must be sure, though, to approach this exercise with kindness and compassion for yourself. If you do, you'll raise your vibration to the level of that which you seek. If you beat yourself up about your thinking and become angry or frustrated, or let yourself become exhausted and depleted from stress or lack of rest, that which you seek will always elude you. You will unintentionally become vulnerable to circumstances of the lower vibrational frequencies, which the law of attraction will have to bring you instead. Choose your beliefs based on how they make you feel, not on ""fact."" Think about perfect health, prosperity, peace, and so on. If this is hard for you, and feels more like denial, then do not place these thoughts within the context of the current circumstances of your life. You won't be a vibrational match to something you're too aware you don't have. Don't think of the ""hows"" -- ""How am I going to have a beautiful home?"" ""How am I going to find a career that I love?"" Just think of the good things in life as positive concepts all their own. The emotional connection you make with these ideas, without trying to figure out how they would fit into your current situation, will activate them in your vibration and begin the process of allowing the law of attraction to do its job in a positive way for you.That brings us to step two, because what you believe is...Step 2: What You Can Expect:So when your mind has given its attention to a thought long enough that it has become a belief and has accepted without a doubt that it will transpire, then an expectation of it has been created. You know for a fact that whatever it is that you believe will eventually occur. You are focusing on it without resistance. There is a knowing inside of you that it must be coming, and therefore, you're looking for it.This leads us to the final step, because your expectation of ""it""...Step 3: Makes It True: Maintaining the vibration of a certain belief, and thus, a certain expectation, allows the law of attraction to bring it into alignment with you and make it your truth. The universe must show you the evidence of that which is active in your vibration. You have included ""it"" in your vibration. This can indeed work for you or against you.The crux of our inability to create in our lives is the self-defeating belief that we cannot have, be, or do that particular thing that we want so badly. For then we certainly will not expect to have, be, or do that thing, and therefore it will never be true.However, it is so hard to fool yourself by saying, for example, ""I believe I own a new car!"" (When you know damned well you don't). Therefore, think of whatever you are wanting to have as existing out there in the realm of all possible worlds. If it's out there somewhere, then could it be possible... ever? Has it happened before? Have you seen it or heard of it happening to someone else? Then maybe, just maybe, you can expect it to happen again. And so it's true that it is likely to happen... don't know when, don't know where, don't know how. All you really need to know is the possibility of it.Now use the equation: Belief + Expectation = Truth:""It is possible to own a new car + I can expect to own a new car = I own a new car.""Bring your focus and attention inward and realize that anything is possible. The only things holding us back are our repetitive thoughts of doubt and negativity which, with some determination, can completely turn around into repetitive thoughts of possibility, in which we have sole creative control. Try it. Experiment with it. Use your imagination. Repeat that belief of possibility over and over again until you can expect it. You'll be amazed at your deliberate creations!For more by Donna Labermeier, click here.For more GPS for the Soul, click here."

The other five are in a",2013-04-03,"A woman and her daughter are frightened while ducks approach closely for food at an amusement park in Beijing, China, Wednesday, April 3, 2013. Scientists taking a first look at the genetics of the bird flu strain that recently killed two men in China said Wednesday the virus could be harder to track than its better-known cousin H5N1 because it might be able to spread silently among poultry without notice. The bird virus also seems to have adapted to be able to be able to sicken mammals like pigs. (AP Photo/Alexander F. Yuan)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cfff62400005000536a45.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Ben Blanchard and Kate KellandBEIJING/LONDON, April 3 (Reuters) - China has found two more cases of a new strain of bird flu and one of the victims has died, state media said on Wednesday, bringing to nine the number of confirmed human infections from the previously unknown flu type.A 38-year-old cook fell ill early last month while working in the province of Jiangsu, where five of the other cases were found. He died in hospital in Hangzhou city on March 27, the Xinhua news agency reported. Samples tested positive on Wednesday for the new bird flu strain, H7N9.The second patient, also in Hangzhou, is a 67-year-old who is having treatment. Xinhua said no connection between the two cases had been discovered, and no one in close contact with either patient had developed any flu-like symptoms.The World Health Organization said it was ""following the event closely"" and was in contact with Chinese authorities, which it said were actively investigating the cases amid heightened disease surveillance.Flu experts across the world are studying samples isolated from the patients to assess H7N9'S human pandemic potential.Other strains of bird flu, such as H5N1, have been circulating for many years and can be transmitted from bird to bird, and bird to human, but not generally from human to human.So far, this lack of human-to-human transmission also appears to be a feature of the H7N9 strain.Of the seven other cases of the new strain, two have died, both in the business hub of Shanghai. The other five are in a critical condition in hospital in Nanjing. Shanghai, Nanjing and Hangzhou are all close to each other in eastern China.China's Agriculture Ministry said it had yet to find any animals infected with H7N9, though added it was possible it had been brought to China by migratory birds.The WHO says so far it has seen no evidence of human-to-human transmission, but there are questions about the source of the infection and about how it may be being transmitted to people.""We still don't know the mode of transmission or host (of the virus),"" said WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl. ""Those are the two most important pieces of information we would need. In order to control it, we need to know where it is coming from.""The WHO said in a statement it was also focusing its efforts on encouraging collaboration between researchers to ensure information and materials are available for scientists wanting to develop diagnostic tests, drugs and vaccines.No vaccine is currently available for H7N9 flu, but preliminary test results provided by the WHO Collaborating Centre in China suggest it is susceptible to the antiviral drugs Tamiflu, sold by the Swiss drugmaker Roche, and Relenza, sold by Britain's GlaxoSmithKline.Chinese authorities dismissed speculation on some websites that the H7N9 outbreak may be related to more than 16,000 pig carcasses found dumped in rivers around Shanghai.Yin Ou, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Committee, told reporters on Tuesday that the city had tested 34 dead pigs found in the city's Huangpu River for the H7N9 virus, but the tests had all come back negative.China has a chequered record when it comes to tackling disease outbreaks, which some officials have previously sought to cover up. However, since the H7N9 cases have been identified, China has stepped up its alert level and said it is being transparent in dealing with them.In 2003, authorities initially tried to cover up an epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, which emerged in China and killed about a 10th of the 8,000 people it infected worldwide."

I met her three years ago when she was dating my stepson, she came on a family vacation to my favorite place in the world, the island of Tinos. It was a delight to get to know her -- she is gorgeous, a straight-A student, half French and one of the funniest people I know. Today, she is a model. I think she might actually be the next Gisele... I have always wondered about what it is like to be a model, is it as glamorous as I imagine? Do models really live on lettuce and vodka? Her answers to my questions were quite enlightening...  The photo that started it all by Megan Claire.AP: How did you decide to get into modeling?  CS: Modeling found me! I had some photos done with one of New Orleans' most talented photographers, Megane Claire. Her website was discovered by Ford, who asked her to shoot their girls. She asked them to take a look at the pictures she had just taken of me, and I got a call and a contract that very same day. I was in New Orleans volunteering at a women's shelter when I got the call about being a Ford model, there was such a disconnect between what I was witnessing and the opportunity that fell on my lap, it was odd. I was scared but ecstatic. AP: Did you model as a child?  CS: No. People would always say ""you will be a model"" or ""you will be an actress,"" I think partly because of my physique, and partly because I have always been so animated, never shy. I remember once when I was 9 years old and in an Abercombie and they were playing music and I started dancing around, one of their employees said I should model for them. As a kid, that happened a few times, but school was always most important. I never wanted to leave school, so I told myself if modeling was meant to be, it would find me. And it did!AP:What do your parents think of your career choice?  CS: They are very supportive. I have my own income and am traveling the world... Who wouldn't want their child to take advantage of that opportunity? They also trust me. There is a lot of darkness that surrounds this job, but they know that I have a strong head on my shoulder. I also have travelled a lot when I was a child, so they knew I was going to be ok. Actually, Dad begged me not to go to college right after high school. I had been such a hard worker, dedicated to school my whole life, and he thought I should take some time off to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. He was right. I am seeing this as an opportunity to learn more about myself. AP: Do you see yourself being a model forever?  CS: I am not thinking about this as a career. It is not stimulating enough for me to do for the rest of my life. It comes with a lot of perks, and this is a great way to learn about life, but I am thinking this will be a two or three year thing for me. Of course, this job can change overnight: you can go from being nobody to somebody in a week. If that happens to me, then who knows... but I do have going back to school in my plan. AP: Tell me about the lifestyle.  CS: I sleep on someone's couch, I am not really in one place for more than 3 months (in the year I have been doing this, I spent 3 months in Miami, 3 months in Paris, and I have now been in NYC for about 5). I am staying with a family friend -- she is like an aunt, she has been in our family forever. I didn't want to sign a lease that I will leave in two months. There is such a thing as ""model apartments,"" which are managed by the agencies, like group corporate housing for 5 or 6 models together, but that never appealed to me. The hardest thing about the lifestyle is that I don't know what I will be doing tomorrow. I am such a planner, but I can't plan, because usually the day's schedule is announced to me the morning of. The other really hard thing is that the lifestyle can be excruciatingly lonely, because people come and go so fast and it is hard to build relationships. It's not like you go to work and see the same people every day... When I got my first contract, I was in a very serious relationship with someone who did not approve of my career choice; he thought I was being exploited for my looks. Some guys have a really hard time letting their girlfriends be in front of the camera... I dated someone after that, but then I had to move to Paris, so it was long distance thing, and that didn't work out either. I am really trying my best to stay single... it has been hard, I am a lover, I fall in love quickly!On the bright side, I am learning so much more than I would be in school. I am learning about real life, and am meeting people that have done things I would not even have imagined possible. I'm not meeting doctors and lawyers... There are also some amazing perks, such as being invited to the Cannes Film Festival, on ski trips, never really having to pay for a meal. I do love those perks even if sometimes I feel guilty about taking advantage of them. AP: Do you eat lettuce and exercise like crazy?  CS: I was raised to eat everything. My Mom is French, so there was always lots of fruit, bread and salad on the table. I was taught to include all of the food groups. I eat pretty much whatever I want, although I try not to eat massive amounts of anything. But honestly, I am super low maintenance and I can't say I have ever dieted. It also helps that I enjoy eating healthy food. I do a lot of underwear and bathing suit work, so I need to have some meat on me (relatively!). In terms of exercise, again, I am very low-maintenance. I walk everywhere. I love walking around New York City. I go to castings an hour early so that I can walk there instead of taking a taxi. It saves money, it is great exercise and I get to learn about the place I live in. Overall, I have to say that food and exercise are not talked about a lot between the models... AP: Any beauty or fashion tips?  CS: In terms of beauty, I am super low maintenance. I try to not wear makeup unless I am working because they put so much makeup during photoshoots that I feel that I need to give my skin a break. In terms of clothing, I live out of a suitcase a lot... I wear a lot of simple clothing like white t-shirts, and a lot of black because it is slimming, and it goes from day to night easily (for example black jeans with ballet flats during the day and with high heels for evening). My typical outfit will be black pants, a tank top with a sweater on top and a leather jacket. I have a pair of heels in my bag at all times, which I need for castings and to go out at night. Right now, my favorite heels are my Dolce Vitas, they look good with everything. I just bought a second pair of the same heels because I love them so much! No hair or makeup, photo by Michael Nafzinger.AP: Tell me about your current agency, One Management, and about the work side of things. CS: I am on the Women's Board at One Management. There are three people on that board -- the director and two bookers. They all work to book me for shows and photoshoots. I love One because they are a smaller agency, they only have 60 girls in New York City, and really only about 30 are in town at the same time. I am with Ford in Miami and Chicago, and also still have a contract with my Parisian agency. AP: Do you do photoshoots and runway shows?  CS: Shows really only happen during a very specific part of the year -- i.e. fashion week. I much prefer photoshoots, I really am not a runway girl. I have curves, and I look different than a lot of the typical runway girls, so I don't get booked for those that often. I did do a Chloe runway show in Miami, as well as a couple bathing suit shows... Runway shows actually don't pay as well, if at all. A lot of times, you get paid in trade, which means I get to keep some clothes. But that doesn't really help in terms of paying rent! My father likens runway shows to being a walking coat hanger... I much prefer the photoshoots, which can pay between $2,000 and $3,000 for an 8-hour day. AP: Where will you be in 6 months?  CS: Who knows! I really have fallen in love with New York City, and I just recently started working with One Management, so I would like to stay put for a few more months. But part of me also is dreaming about going back to Paris. From a work perspective, that was the most successful city for me, I think because in Paris I am different-looking. I am tanned and blond and I have curves... Often I would almost leave castings because I felt so out of place, everyone was so fair, stick thin and brunette! I think personality has also a lot to do with it. Europeans tend to be reserved, whereas I am this funny New Orleanian that happens to speak French. I laugh a lot during castings, I have fun, I crack myself up and I think the French photographers really responded to that."

I love One because they are a smaller agency, they only have 60 girls in New York City, and really only about 30 are in town at the same time. I am with Ford in Miami and Chicago, and also still have a contract with my Parisian agency. AP: Do you do photoshoots and runway shows?  CS: Shows really only happen during a very specific part of the year -- i.e. fashion week. I much prefer photoshoots, I really am not a runway girl. I have curves, and I look different than a lot of the typical runway girls, so I don't get booked for those that often. I did do a Chloe runway show in Miami, as well as a couple bathing suit shows... Runway shows actually don't pay as well, if at all. A lot of times, you get paid in trade, which means I get to keep some clothes. But that doesn't really help in terms of paying rent! My father likens runway shows to being a walking coat hanger... I much prefer the photoshoots, which can pay between $2,000 and $3,000 for an 8-hour day. AP: Where will you be in 6 months?  CS: Who knows! I really have fallen in love with New York City, and I just recently started working with One Management, so I would like to stay put for a few more months. But part of me also is dreaming about going back to Paris. From a work perspective, that was the most successful city for me, I think because in Paris I am different-looking. I am tanned and blond and I have curves... Often I would almost leave castings because I felt so out of place, everyone was so fair, stick thin and brunette! I think personality has also a lot to do with it. Europeans tend to be reserved, whereas I am this funny New Orleanian that happens to speak French. I laugh a lot during castings, I have fun, I crack myself up and I think the French photographers really responded to that."

After years of working through the issues, effects and emotions of their early divorce, I now regard them not as parents accountable for my life's hardships, but rather as two extraordinary people, different in many ways, each possessing strength, wisdom and heart that are amazing gifts to me and to the world. Countless times have I made the drive back and forth between my parents' homes, able to experience and soak in the ineffable treasures of their presence and being. Whatever loss I may have felt in my earlier life resulting from their divorce has been supplanted by a rich harvest of days and blessings. It is as if I am at a 10-mile long dining table, receiving sustenance and nourishment from both ends. With my father's recent passing, this commute has taken on a previously-unrecognized poignancy. Traversing the intervening neighborhoods evokes a cascade of sensation, an emotional sonata, as I pass between the mingled fields of parental love and history. Driving, I'm like a bow being pulled across the strings. Now, I am in the rondo, the third movement, where things that used to matter don't and things that never mattered do; where the mundane appears vivid and even the simplest, most ordinary routines become holy.info@kindsightfoundation.orgwww.robertzuckerman.comFor more by Robert G.

But if you've ever suffered the misfortune of being cheated on, you know that it's pretty easy to get caught up in the ""leave"" part the equation and neglect the ""gain a life"" part. The logistics of divorce are hellish. It's painful and draining. Understandably, you can get sidetracked from the important work of rebuilding a new life when you're still stumbling around in the ruins of the former one. But that's where the pay off is -- the new life.If you've ever tangled with a narcissist (and in my opinion, cheating is narcissism), you know the default channel for your life is set at ""narcissist."" Their needs. Their reactions. What fresh hell are they up to now? We scramble around and waste precious time and energy trying to appease them, or decode them, or commiserate about them.But what about you? How does it feel to have this idiot out of your life (or almost out of your life... keep going). Does the air breathe cleaner? Have you felt the relief? Does it feel a bit disorienting?I know some days are lonely as hell. But take the opportunity to enjoy the free fall. The raw nerved excitement/terror of ""what next""? And build, build, build! Make this new life yours and fill it with awesomeness. People who love you right. Activities that you feel passionate about. Parenting with your values and your traditions.Oh shut up Tracy, I hear you saying. My life is an endless drudge of single parenting and luke warm, limp Hot Pockets for dinner.

They can cheat on you, lie to you, steal your 401K, malign you to the neighbors, and dress your kid funny -- but they can't take away your awesomeness. That's the investment you get to control -- how much you put into this new, improved life. Whether that's making it through each day right now without sobbing on strangers, or going back to school, or buying new bed linens. (Get all new bed linens, you know that right? Burn the marital bed if you can, but at the very least invest in a dust ruffle.)It's hard work. It's important work and you've only got so much energy. So when you feel yourself obsessing over the injustice of your divorce, or what stupid thing the nitwit is posting on Facebook today, put that energy back on your new life. It needs you.

9,FOOD & DRINK,Cooking Off the Cuff: Two-Ingredient Pasta -- Literally Mac And Cheese,"Edward Schneider, Contributor
Travel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-twoi_us_5b9cf92ae4b03a1dcc836a25,Macaroni and cheese is almost never just macaroni and cheese. But with the right cheese you can quickly cut the ingredients list to the two items in the dish's name.,2013-04-02,Gorgonzola Cremificato: All You Need To Dress The Pasta,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf92a2000003100fdc909.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Macaroni and cheese is almost never just macaroni and cheese. Typical recipes include milk or cream and a flour-and-butter roux to make a sauce base into which the cheese is melted -- plus any number of add-ins from prosciutto to mushrooms. And I shall merely mention the fact that one version of the stuff in a cardboard box contains 20, few of which count as food.But with the right cheese you can quickly cut the ingredients list to the two items in the dish's name (plus salt, pepper and water for boiling the pasta). What is the right cheese? It is one that melts into a smooth, creamy sauce that won't seize up and turn to concrete. And it is one whose flavor has complexity and interest enough that it needs no help.For me, that cheese is gorgonzola, specifically gorgonzola cremificato, which has those attributes in spades. It is at once creamy, blue-cheese-moldy and piquant, and it melts into as smooth a goo as, dare I say it, Velveeta. It is sometimes sold sliced from a somewhat amorphous blob, and sometimes, if it is especially soft, scraped into a container. Its rind is edible, though I tend to remove most of it for this dish for aesthetic reasons.Besides there being nearly no shopping list, there's almost no recipe. For two portions: When a pot of salted water comes to the boil, add 200 grams (or half a pound, which is a little more) of short pasta and cook it until done. While that is happening, put five or six ounces of gorgonzola cremificato into a skillet and melt it over low heat, stirring and prodding it with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon. If you cannot find this particular cheese, normal ""sweet"" gorgonzola will work well, too, but you'll need to add a couple of tablespoons of milk to the skillet to help it melt into a sauce.When the pasta is done, drain it (saving some of the cooking water) and stir it into the melted cheese. If necessary add a little of the water. It won't need salt, but you may want to grind in some black pepper -- I always do.You can call it Cappelletti with Gorgonzola Cremificato if you like, but I say it's macaroni and cheese and nothing but macaroni and cheese."
