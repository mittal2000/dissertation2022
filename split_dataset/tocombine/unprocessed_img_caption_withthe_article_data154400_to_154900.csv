Krugman discussed the performance of bonds, Fed monetary policy, and the U.S. economy compared with that of Japan. Photographer: Scott Eells/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2f5501f0000250123b761.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"They say hindsight is 20/20, but according to Paul Krugman it may actually be much worse than that when it comes to economic policy-making. The Nobel-Prize winning economist and New York Times columnist wrote in a blog post Sunday that current policymakers are basing their decisions to cut spending, leading in many cases to high unemployment, on the false notion that the recession of the late 1970s and early 1980s was caused by too much government debt and too many government handouts. During the period leading up to that recession government debt was low and stable or falling as a share of the economy. What actually caused the recession of the late 1970s, Krugman writes, was an unfortunate vicious cycle of workers demanding more money because they expected prices to rise, companies raising prices to pay for their increased costs as well as big oil price shocks. “It would be bad enough if we were basing policy today on lessons from the 70s,” Krugman wrote in the blog post Sunday. “It’s even worse that we’re basing policy today on a mythical 70s that never was.” Though Krugman has been criticizing some policymakers’ obsession with austerity for years, the strategy has recently come under fire after a widely-cited paper by Harvard economists Carmen Reinhart and Ken Rogoff thought to prove that high levels of government debt correlated with economic downturns, turned out to be riddled with errors. For their part, Reinhart and Rogoff have tried to disown the austerity movement -- which included Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), the U.K.’s George Osborne and other prominent politicians -- which cited their research as a way to justify their policies.Earlier this month former President Bill Clinton backed Krugman’s argument that a laser-sharp focus on cutting the deficit can lead to high unemployment and other economic problems, saying “It's obvious that if you overdo austerity, you get Europe.” The average unemployment rate in the Eurozone is at a record 12.1 percent and the region is currently mired in the longest recession in its history. Some experts blame the region’s policymakers’ obsessive focus on slashing government debt for the eurozone’s economic woes. At least in the U.S., it turns out runaway debt may not be as much of a concern as originally thought, despite politicians’ panic. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office found earlier this month that the deficit is likely to shrink rapidly through 2015. "
1,BUSINESS,Bangladesh Factory Banned By Walmart Still Making Wrangler Shirts,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bangladesh-factory-wrangler-shirts-walmart_us_5bb2f551e4b0480ca65f8910,It was not clear whether this audit included a Ferro scan.

VF, whose other clothing brands include North Face, Timberland and Nautica, said its philosophy was to ""stay and improve"" working conditions.""We are in daily contact with the facility and VF's leadership is closely monitoring the status in this facility and others in our Bangladesh supply chain,"" the company said in a statement to Reuters.VF's continued relationship with Liz Apparels stands in stark contrast to the approach by some of the world's best-known retailers, who immediately severed ties with the same factory.The differing views show how Western retailers and brands are struggling to assess safety risks at thousands of Bangladesh garment factories after the April 24 collapse of Rana Plaza in another Dhaka suburb, which killed 1,127 people.Their task is made tougher by a lack of robust safety rules, a severe shortage of trained building inspectors and equipment needed to make proper safety assessments, and widespread concerns about corruption. ""RED LIST""Wal-Mart told Reuters on Friday that Liz Apparels in Gazipur, near the capital Dhaka, had previously made clothing for its stores but was now on its ""red"" list of unapproved suppliers after a safety audit in early May found the cracks.Wal-Mart has not published the full findings of that audit, conducted by testing and inspection company Bureau Veritas , which also included checks for fire hazards and a review of building plans. It has asked the Bangladesh government to investigate what it called ""potentially dangerous conditions"" in the building.Inditex, which owns the Zara clothing chain, said it sent inspectors to the factory on Wednesday after seeing Wal-Mart's report, and they too saw wall cracks, which the company plans to report to the Bangladesh authorities.But VF said the building was cleared for ""normal operations"" after the May 12 inspection. VF, headquartered in Greensboro, North Carolina, later said it would pay for its own inspections which had not yet been completed.""The cracks that developed here are not really dangerous, not dangerous for the structure,"" said Mohammad Jasim Uddin, an executive director of the Nassa Group. He said he had studied civil engineering and was responsible for looking after structural safety of all the factories owned by the group.The day before Rana Plaza crumbled, the building's owner dismissed concerns over cracks in the wall and insisted the structure would stand for a century. The 8-storey building had three additional floors added without proper approval. There was no indication that the building housing Liz Apparels deviated from its approved plans.Reuters Television video taken inside Liz Apparels on Wednesday showed a vertical crack running up one wall, which appeared to have been re-plastered recently. Other cracks were visible near the ceiling. Reuters could not independently assess whether the cracks posed a structural risk, and it was not clear how they compared with those seen at Rana. NORMAL OPERATIONSLiz Apparels, which is not currently making clothes for Wal-Mart or Inditex, is one of 34 factories owned by Nassa Group, a major player in Bangladesh's fragmented $20 billion garment industry with annual sales volume of $270 million.Inside the factory on Wednesday, rows of workers stitched denim-coloured fabric into long-sleeved shirts, adding Wrangler labels and price tags. Nassa has about 3,500 employees working in the 7-storey building, which was built in 2003.Liz Apparels was inspected on behalf of Nassa Group by Shaheedullah and New Associates Ltd, which VF called ""one of the top three engineering companies in Bangladesh."" The third-party engineering consultant examined all the columns and beams on all floors and found ""no significant or impermissible foundation settlement has taken place.""""We also certify that the building can continue to be used for normal operation,"" Shaheedullah wrote in a letter dated May 14, a copy of which Nassa officials gave Reuters.Sultan Mahmud, a civil engineer who works for Shaheedullah, said he inspected the building on his own and spent two hours taking measurements, studying soil reports and structural and architectural drawings. He also used a hammer to knock on columns to listen for any void and to gauge the strength.On Wednesday, VF said based on Shaheedullah's inspection and a review by the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers & Export Association, ""it has been determined that normal operations can continue at this facility.""Two days later, in response to further questions from Reuters, VF said it was paying for additional inspections but provided no details on who would conduct the reviews or when they would take place.""VF will continue to be diligent about following up on any concerns in relation to structural integrity, fire safety and any issues where we determine there is a concern of worker safety,"" the company said, adding that it had increased the frequency of unannounced inspections in Bangladesh.Inditex declined to comment on the inspection done for Nassa. Wal-Mart said its ethical sourcing team had asked to see the entire Shaheedullah report and will review it.$10,000 AUDITSJamilur Reza Choudhury, a former professor of civil engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology, said Shaheedullah's founder was a ""very reputed engineer"" but that a proper inspection required machines such as Ferro scanners which are used to check for steel reinforcement in concrete. Visual inspections were not enough.""To complete a proper, thorough and dependable inspection it requires up to two months, not two hours,"" he said.Because Bangladesh is prone to earthquakes, groups such as the Asian Disaster Preparedness Center recommend Ferro scans. However, a review of Bangladesh's building code posted on its website found no requirement for these scans.Wal-Mart has asked Bureau Veritas to examine the 279 Bangladesh factories that make clothing for its stores, part of its response to a series of garment factory disasters including a fire that killed more than 100 people in late November.Wal-Mart said the review conducted at Liz Apparels included thermal circuit imaging to check for possible electrical faults, a comparison of approved building designs against the actual building construction, and a visual inspection.It was not clear whether this audit included a Ferro scan. The retailer has so far released only a few details of the inspection, but said it intends to start publishing results from its Bangladesh factory audits on its website starting in June.Bangladesh has only about 200 trained building inspectors and should have 200,000, said Emdadul Islam, the chief engineer of the state-run City Development Authority. The country's population is above 160 million, making it the world's eighth largest, according to the CIA World Factbook.""There are 1.25 million buildings in the capital city alone and there are no statistics on how many buildings there are in the country,"" Islam said.Jay Jorgensen, Wal-Mart's chief compliance officer, said Veritas sends in a small team of engineers to conduct fire, electrical and structural reviews at the Bangladesh factories. It takes between 8 and 20 days to complete each safety audit at a cost that can exceed $10,000 per factory, he said.""The audits that we're doing now, with this special focus on safety, I still don't know anybody else who does that level of detail,"" Jorgensen told Reuters on Thursday.When a review turns up safety concerns, Wal-Mart notifies the factory owner and the local authorities, and also calls other companies that may use the same supplier.After Rana Plaza collapsed, Nassa Group voluntarily shut down three of its factories for safety reasons, said Khandaker Mohammed Saiful Alam, managing director of the group.But it left Liz Apparels operating because ""the tiny and hair-like crack lines are only on plaster and not the bricks on the main wall,"" Alam said.

The annual slate for the film institute in Qatar will include two festivals, the Qumra Film Festival Doha, to focus on emerging directors and kicking off in March 2014, with a competition to expand to films from around the world, and the Ajyal Film Festival for the Young which will offer community-based programming, with its first edition in November 2013. This announcement follows the recent appointment of groundbreaking filmmaker Elia Suleiman as Artistic Advisor to DFI. For someone like me who sees within cinema the single most important bridge between cultures that haven't always seen eye to eye, the announcements are huge.I caught up with Abdulaziz Al Khater, CEO of DFI, Fatma Al Remaihi, the Festival Director of the Ajyal Film Festival for the Young and Elia Suleiman at the Majestic on the Croisette and asked them each to define their own vision for DFI, within their very important individual roles in the organization.Abdulaziz Al KhaterWhat do you hope to achieve with this new format?  AAK: DFI's mission is to develop a culture of film appreciation, to develop filmmakers from the Middle East and the region. When you look at that, it seems like a one-statement goal but for us, for me personally it is a very important one. Our region is incredibly rich in stories and we come from a storytelling culture, I think it's very important that we're able to tell these stories in a way that's compelling and that has reach. And film, in today's world, is one of the most powerful mediums.What to do about the current ""us against them"" mentality present in the world? AAK: We only have ourselves to blame for this feeling. When we reevaluated our festival, our grants program we realized so long as we keep it MENA and Arab we will always be closed in on ourselves. Hence the primary motivation for the change has been to internationalize what we're doing. To create a meeting place, where people can share ideas and collaborate. Not exclusive to Middle Easterners. One of the expressions H.H. Sheikha Mayassa always uses and I like very much is ""We want to bring the world to Qatar, and take Qatar to the world.""Why two festivals?AAK: The format of our festival had family days but we realized that we couldn't afford that kind of lack of focus. We love the family days and the ideas of our festival and lets give them each what they deserve and create two festivals, one for the youth, their parents and their teachers in November, while the other festival will be very, very focused on emerging filmmakers but international. The competition will be open to first and second time filmmakers. With the March festival, it's a tremendous opportunity to gather people in Doha and discuss what we love, which is cinema. We want to create a year-round hub, not only seven or eight days of festival, in support of a year-long program of our grants, our programs, our labs, also refocused on emerging filmmaker.Fatma Al RemaihiWhy an Ajyal Film Festival for the Young? FAR: From the past experiences we learned many things, like for example that our community needs a lot of focus. We are building an industry and if you are doing it, you need to build an audience with it, build the filmmakers and we want to start with the very young and get them interested. We saw from the past four years that there's a huge appetite for it. People will be very excited that we're focusing on them and building a cinema culture within this community. Everyone will have something in the family festival.What do you think of cinema as a means to bridge cultures?FAR: For me, I've been going to festivals and watching films from around the world, and personally it has made me see that we all share the same issues, the same difficulties in life, day by day. A story may take place in Europe but I face the same problem in my house or my family. When I even talk to producers from around the world, their challenges are the same as ours in Qatar, though they are established industries. It makes me believe that this big world of ours is really a small village. And watching a film is so much better than watching the news.So when you say ""family festival"" it's not going to be just about Finding Nemo?FAR: No, absolutely not. It will include films with substance, films that bring families together, that bridge the gap between the generations that we have now, with kids so tech savvy and their parents trying to keep up. The clash that is happening, even for me on a personal level, I want to benefit from the festival as a woman with a family. Elia SuleimanJust by being you, culturally so complex, you shatter the divides of ""the other"" mentality. How do you think you can help bridge the Arab world and the Western world? ES: There are many levels where we could take this conversation but if we talk about what I'm doing in Doha, I can at least say this, I come with that package because of the sort of films that I make. Because of the sort of upbringing I have. I was not educated in one place, it was a nomadic culture experience. I'm fed on American and European and far worldly cinema and books, in NY at its best time, in the 80s and 90s.How will this help the Doha Film Institute?ES: I don't believe in Occident and Orient, and I don't think that the Orient is so oriental and the Occident is so occidental. I think it has been an interchange. If we put colonialism and post-colonialism on the side, I don't know how we can point out one thing that is truly Arian and one thing that is purely Arab, it's all mingled for centuries. I'm coming naturally to continue what has been happening for hundreds of years. The problem is when we are saying Occident and Orient, Arab and non-Arab or us and them, I think this is a post-colonial residue. This festival is not going to be about what is Arab and what is not Arab, this is a house of culture - and not a question of ""whose culture"". It's an equally shared interchange, cultural esthetic environment. We are talking about an international film festival. And it's not a new invention, it's to bring back what has been happening for hundreds of years.What are going to be your challenges?ES: What I'm doing is as an artistic advisor so I'm not on the ground level, I'm throwing concepts and debating ideas. I don't have a particular challenge because I'm absolutely certain that if one is sincere, if one is well intentioned I don't think it's a challenge but exciting, interesting and it simply gives me pleasure to do this.Photo of Abdulaziz Al Khater by ©Brigitte Lacombe, all images courtesy of DFI, used with permission"
