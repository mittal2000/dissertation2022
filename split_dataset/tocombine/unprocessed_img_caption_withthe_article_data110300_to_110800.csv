Human Bean.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-congress-challenges-a_b_5808404.html,"In the end, by subverting reality, going around and beyond it, The Congress manages to circumvent the brain and deliver meaning straight into the heart.",2014-09-12,2014-09-12-thecongressrobinwrightpaulgiamattikodismitmcphee.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-09-12-thecongressrobinwrightpaulgiamattikodismitmcphee-thumb.jpg,"I'm going to save you 10 bucks, but it's not on a movie. Take an ordinary piece of paper and cut out a section about a centimeter square. Then place it on your tongue and go see The Congress. Sure as death and taxes, at some point in watching this movie you'll swear there was something on that paper.This is the third full-length movie from director Ari Folman, who won a slew of awards for his second, 2008's arrestingly emotive documentary Waltz With Bashir. Like that film, this one is a combination of live action and cartoon animation, though here the story is fictitious and favors far more real life visuals than the earlier release.On a superficial level, The Congress is the story of Robin Wright (played by herself), who at the age of 44, faced with a sick son and a history of ""bad decisions"" in the industry, agrees to be ""scanned"" by not-so-subtly named ""Miramount Pictures"": meaning she's digitally recorded, and will be reproduced in any film they choose. Although the scanning technology is relegated to the beginning of the move (and becomes obsolete in ways that can't be explained without spoiling things), it's a device that's been latched onto by critics and used to judge The Congress  as a hollow or heartless indictment of the movie industry. Which is a criminal offense in missing the point of a movie.Once The Congress gets past a fairly tired re-utilization of tropes in the scanning storyline (which can feel like a train driver barely awake at the controls -- or worse, a recreation of April's dud Transcendence), it delivers in spades on questions larger and far more interesting. Questions about what the essence a person is, what truth is, and what makes people so desperate to escape reality -- if that's even an absolute thing. This is undoubtedly the aim of both the director and Stanislaw Lem, whose novel The Futurological Congress the film is based on.The opening scenes aren't a total loss -- they're saved by great performances by Harvey Keitel, Danny Hutson, Robin Wright, and even relative newcomer Sami Gayle, whose slyly impudent, just-treading-on-a-parent's-patience performance of Wright's daughter is poignant enough to pluck the nerves of anyone who's ever met a teenager.After the story is wound in the opening, viewers have but a short wait to what can only be called an orgasmic ode to Max Fleischer on a healthy dose of drugs. From their broken beginning, the animated sequences flower into a no-holds-barred trip that bends reality in half and bounces mercilessly on the curve like some kind of Dr. Seuss character.For all their glory, these scenes will likely prove the film's biggest challenge for viewers. They are unquestionably psychedelic, resolutely unusual, and can at times feel impenetrable. Folman does scatter almost painfully literal signposts throughout, but at over two hours long, The Congress can at moments feel like you're slogging through a swamp with no end in sight.Keep watching anyway. Less than a vital story element, these animated lengths are a tool that Folman is using to larger and better ends: to alienate audiences from the person of the actors, make pleasure feel purposefully cold, and if nothing else at all, serve as a canvas for some first-rate voice acting.In the end, by subverting reality, going around and beyond it, The Congress manages to circumvent the brain and deliver meaning straight into the heart. Though Folman asks viewers for a necessarily two-handed commitment to the conceit, once it's given he makes more than good on his promise of the vision of a lifetime."

Andrew Michael Nisbet, 32, had been facing 75 felony counts for allegedly molesting boys between the ages of 12 and 17 who were his students, according to CBS San Francisco. While in jail last year, he allegedly tried to hire a hit man to kill the children making the accusations. Police say Nisbet wrote letters from behind bars saying he wanted to have two victims ""taken care of,"" according to the San Francisco Chronicle.“From my training and experience that means he is asking to have the victims killed,” Alameda County District Attorney Inspector Jeff McCort said in a probable cause statement cited by CBS. An undercover agent working for the district attorney visited Nisbet in jail and recorded a meeting in which the suspect provided information about the kids he wanted slain. The Oakland Tribune says Nisbet wanted the killings to look like robberies gone wrong.On Thursday, Nisbet pleaded guilty to three counts of child molestation, three counts of solicitation of murder and one count of possession of child pornography, the Chronicle reported.As part of a plea deal, 79 other charges -- enough to put him in jail for life -- were dismissed, the Tribune said. Instead, he'll be sentenced next month to 27 years and four months in prison and waive credit for time served. He'll also have to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life. Nisbet was an instructor at the Las Positas Golf Course in Livermore, Calif. He was arrested in December last year, just one day before he was to receive the PGA's Northern California Section 2013 Junior Golf Leader Award ""for his dedication and leadership in developing a wealth of exciting and educational golf programs for juniors,"" ABC 7 reported.

Even if you happen to not recognize his name, you most likely visited, stayed, or eaten in one of his many establishments. Earl is the founder and CEO of Planet Hollywood International and the chairman of the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino in Las Vegas. He is also the owner of the popular restaurants Earl of Sandwich and Buca di Beppo. Earl's new venture puts him in front of the camera with his show on the Cooking Channel called Be My Guest. Each week Earl takes his passion for food on the road visiting restaurants and other food venues all over the world. During his travels he visited a variety of places from four-star restaurants to food trucks. He also searches for the ""hidden gems,"" the restaurants that might not be as popular, but that does not mean the quality of food or service is lacking. So why would someone (who already has thriving businesses) want to take time out of his business schedule to run around the world? ""I got tricked into doing it!"" Earl exclaims. ""I thought I was planning the show and when we didn't have a host, I ended up doing it and quite enjoyed it.""While on his travels, he doesn't just take the viewer to great places to eat, but they also venture into the kitchen where he learns some of their award-winning dishes. Famous chefs like Robb Lucas (Koi), Yi Jia Qjan (Mr. Chow), and Hung Huynh (Catch) are among the many that viewers will see and learn from. He also doesn't typically dine alone with a variety of guests joining him on his journey including the likes of Holly Madison and Lisa Vanderpump as well as the Knick City Dancers.  (Robert Earl)With all the travel and cooking shows out there (or a combination of the two), what separates this show from the competition? ""It is a combination of all of those great things the other shows offer."" Earl says. ""It truly is a travel show, a restaurant guide and a cooking show, presented with a bit of humor and some interesting guests."" Besides watching the show, does Robert Earl have any tips for all the traveling foodies out there who may want to venture out on their own? ""To find good restaurants while traveling, I would advise that you search local publications online for prior reviews from the past two months and cross-reference them to see if there is any consistency."" Earl exclaims. ""Try and find out if there is a similar message and you will see which places regularly garner positive feedback.""With all his accomplishments, this advice is something that traveling food lovers should take. However, Robert Earl also has a likeability factor that clearly comes off on-screen. The show is more laid-back and light-hearted, while still teaching the viewer about new places and dishes. ""It is different than the others out there right now and provides a fun experience for viewers,"" Earl states.   He doesn't like what he does, he loves what he does. With the show Be My Guest this is shown clearly on-screen. Plus, when I asked him what went into an exceptional dish, I expected something fancy or expensive. Robert Earl's answer? ""Butter."" Exactly. ""Be My Guest"" airs Monday at 12 P.M. EST on the Cooking Channel. To learn more about the show, you can visit the official site here."

It's going to be here for a while."" Berry was one of at least four major stars wearing pixies at the Emmys and the MTV Video Music Awards held just days earlier.I don't know that I would have watched these if I wasn't writing about them. I would have seen the galleries online but, now, I'll never miss them again. There was Halle Berry, Lena Headey from ""Game of Thrones,"" Kaley Cuoco-Sweeting of ""The Big Bang Theory"" and Miley Cyrus all wearing pixies, no two the same. I got an update on trends, and I was challenged to make them happen. In my head I began tweaking them for my own clients. I also saw what wasn't there. Nearly absent were the dramatic hombres. Colors are moving toward softer, more subtle combinations and natural-looking tones. Even Miley Cyrus chose to go with a soft, relatively quiet pixie.I love being a stylist, and I know that you do, too. It is such a wonderful profession for a lot of reasons. It can, however, become routine if we're not careful. We get a handful of cuts and colors that we're really good at, and that's where we stay. That's not so good for us or our clients, and it's partly their fault. ... Yes, let's blame them for a minute! We make them beautiful, they come back for more and what do we do? The same cut and color! Another client comes in with the same cheekbones and skin tones and we do a variation on them, as well.Our work is beautiful, but grows stale. So, onward we must go.

A lot of what I've seen includes slick-back wet looks, ponytails, center parts and loose braids, but gorgeous variations. Much of this is totally within the realm of broadly wearable styles, This isn't just for the fashion elite.

4,POLITICS,Why The Top GOP Corporate Lobbying Group Is Fudging The Math To Help Democrats,Zach Carter,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/chamber-of-commerce-export-import-bank_n_5807218.html,,2014-09-12,"US President Barack Obama smiles after making a statement in the briefing room of the White House on August 1, 2014 in Washington. Obama declared that the US economy was getting stronger and had generated 'the longest streak of private sector job creation in history.' AFP PHOTO/Nicholas KAMM (Photo credit should read NICHOLAS KAMM/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d5b6200000c70101d2d8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- America's flagship corporate lobbying group seems to have a problem with math.The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is a reliable backer of the Republican Party. So it was unusual to see the organization invoke a narrative straight out of the Democratic Party playbook last week, calling for the re-authorization of the Export-Import Bank as a way to tear down barriers to the economic success of women. The numbers it invoked were also eye-catching, to say the least.""Nearly 90% of Ex-Im’s transactions support the exports of small and medium-size businesses, and one in five of the Bank's authorizations supported women- and minority-owned businesses,"" the chamber wrote in a blog post titled ""The Export-Import Bank: Fostering the Spirit of Enterprise for Women.""That sentence is simply not true. The clear implication is that 20 percent of the bank's transactions aid businesses that are owned by women or minorities. But according to Ex-Im's own website, just 476 of the 8,499 companies that received its subsidies from 2007 to 2014 are owned by women -- 5.6 percent. About 8.1 percent are minority-owned. Together, that's 13.7 percent, assuming none of the women who own businesses that receive Ex-Im subsidies are also minorities.The Ex-Im Bank guarantees cheap loans to foreign firms that want to buy U.S. goods, effectively providing subsidies for American exports. Many progressive Democrats -- including then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) and then-Rep. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) -- once attacked the agency as a dispenser of ""corporate welfare,"" since a huge proportion of its subsidies end up supporting very wealthy corporations. In 2013, nearly half of its activity benefited just three companies: Boeing, General Electric and Caterpillar. But Democrats, including President Obama, are now rallying around the bank as it faces the same corporate welfare attack from hard-line conservatives. Ex-Im's current congressional authorization expires on Sept. 30, and Democrats have been fighting to extend its charter.That has left the Chamber of Commerce seeking new friends to save the Ex-Im Bank -- something many Democrats had explicitly hoped for -- with appeals to economic opportunity for women, which is a losing issue for Republicans. The Chamber of Commerce could have made its blog post correct by writing that it reached the 20 percent figure by excluding all of the bank's subsidies to big businesses, with their multiple shareholders. But that wouldn't have made reauthorizing the bank sound so beneficial to women and minorities. The Washington Examiner's Tim Carney argued that even the chamber's fudged numbers are not particularly flattering to the bank. At best, he wrote, they show the bank keeping pace with the percentage of women-owned businesses in the economy. Economists have previously expressed skepticism about Ex-Im's statistics on its work, pointing out that highlighting the number of transactions, instead of the overall monetary value of those transactions, obscures the amount of aid that goes to wealthy corporations. The definition of ""small business"" that the bank deploys is also particularly expansive.As Veronique de Rugy, a senior research fellow at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, pointed out recently, ""If you're a company with 1,500 employees or less than $21 million in annual revenue, you're a small business in the eyes of Ex-Im."""

The newly-mobilised soldiers take part in a combat training prior leaving for the east of the country to carry out an Anti-Terrorist Operation (ATO). A senior Ukrainian defence official said on September 11 there was no contradiction between President Petro Poroshenko's announcement of a major Russian troop withdrawal and NATO's assertion that 1,000 Kremlin troops remained in the eastern war zone. The European Union has agreed to introduce new sanctions against Russia on September 12 targeting oil and defence firms, but could lift them if a Ukraine ceasefire holds, EU head Herman Van Rompuy said. AFP PHOTO/ SERGEI SUPINSKY (Photo credit should read SERGEI SUPINSKY/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13d2c240000130a51ad64.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Last week's NATO meeting in Wales showed an unexpected and sobering realism on the most pressing issue it has faced in some years, namely the Ukrainian crisis. Despite many pressures on the body to take some sort of decisive action to counter the Russian threat to Ukraine -- beyond sanctions already instituted -- the 28 NATO countries agreed to make only a few limited measures on Ukraine, but mainly focused on strengthening their own security interests. The most important pronouncement NATO made was that it would not be sending NATO troops into Ukraine to help drive out the anti-Kiev rebels and their Russian allies and retake Crimea. NATO was, in effect, saying it was not worth a war with Russia over a non-NATO country in Europe -- conceding that Ukraine was within Russia's ""sphere of influence."" The backroom calculation behind this diplomacy was to seek a Georgia-type solution for Ukraine. As one may recall, in 2008, Moscow, asserting its ancient boundaries, threatened to go to war with Georgia over that nation's claim to two lands adjacent to Georgia -- Abkhazia and South Ossetia. But given Russia's threat of intervention, Georgia realized it could not win such a fight, and, so Georgia, along with the West, acquiesced in the Russian occupation of these states. Since then, though, only a few nations have recognized the independence of those territories. So NATO basically has, in a similar way, tacitly admitted that Moscow will hold onto Crimea and will retain significant influence over Eastern Ukraine through wider autonomy for the region and renewed economic ties with Russia -- though, in both cases, the West will never grant formal diplomatic recognition either to Crimea's takeover or to Russia's intrusion into Eastern Ukraine. But the message that President Poroshenko of Ukraine, who was present at the Wales meeting, got directly from NATO was that, while he might, at best, get a few small tokens of military assistance from the group, he must otherwise work out a cease-fire with the insurgents and the Russians as soon as it was feasible. And as we know, the Ukrainian leader followed up the next day by agreeing to a deal with Putin to put a truce into place. Then, perhaps the most telling outcome of the NATO meeting was NATO's decision not to invite Ukraine to join the organization. For the Russians have seen Ukraine as historically an extension of the Russian empire, so the notion of Ukraine enlisting in NATO has long been one of their red lines. In this case, NATO acceded to Russia's long-term security concerns over Ukraine. In the end, NATO's most substantive response to the Ukrainian crisis was to approve a modest plan for a 4000 member rapid-reaction force based in Eastern Europe which will rotate in and out of all those NATO states that border on Russia. This was done to reassure nations formerly under Soviet rule that their freedom will be guaranteed. There were two additional resolutions -- first, that the 28 nations collectively aim to spend at least 2 percent of each member-nation's gross domestic product over the next ten years on the military, and, second, that NATO backs new European Union sanctions on Russia should Moscow increase its military pressures on Ukraine. Still, with all of these moves, NATO was assuring one thing -- there will be no East-West war in Europe."

9,POLITICS,Dark Money Groups That Spent Millions In 2012 Vanish In 2014,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/dark-money-2014-election_n_5807618.html,,2014-09-12,"NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 09: David H. Koch speaks at the unveiling of the David H. Koch Plaza at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on September 9, 2014 in New York City. (Photo by Paul Zimmerman/WireImage)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d5b82600002d0183babf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- The Iowa-based conservative nonprofit group American Future Fund released new advertisements nearly every week from the spring of 2012 through Election Day that year, hitting President Barack Obama or Democratic Senate candidates in competitive races. By mid-September, the group had spent $9.5 million. It went on to spend north of $30 million on federal races after receiving massive funding from the network operated by the billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch. This year, with eight weeks before the 2014 midterm elections, American Future Fund advertising is nowhere to be seen on the air. The nonprofit, which does not disclose donors, has spent less than $250,000 in federal campaigns and has announced little in the way of issue advocacy targeting candidates.The American Future Fund is not the only nonprofit disappearing act. The conservative nonprofits 60 Plus Association, Americans for Tax Reform, and Americans for Job Security also have largely evaporated from the federal election scene after spending millions in both 2010 and 2012.The disappearances show how nonprofit political networks use groups with the capability for electoral action as fronts for their own campaigns and, when they are no longer useful or become a distraction, how easily they can be cut loose.Nonprofit groups have been a major feature of political campaigns since the Supreme Court's 2007 Wisconsin right to life ruling, and they proliferated after the 2010 Citizens United decision. The groups can raise unlimited sums from corporations, unions and individuals, with the added bonus of keeping donors' identities secret -- so long as they abide by barely enforced rules requiring them to spend the majority of their time and money on the purpose they claimed to obtain tax-exempt status. Collectively, nonprofits have spent more than $142 million on campaigns targeting federal candidates in 2014.Running afoul of federal and state laws and regulations, or the desires of their funders, appears to be a prime reason for this year's lack of spending from these nonprofits. The disappearance of American Future Fund and Americans for Job Security, responsible for more than $15 million in reported 2012 election advertising, came after they were caught laundering campaign contributions into two California ballot initiative campaigns. This revelation by California's Fair Political Practices Commission led to a record settlement requiring the groups to disgorge improperly donated funds and to release a donor list that revealed identities of some secret funders. Neither group responded to inquiries.American Future Fund was almost entirely funded by the Koch political network. The group raised $68 million in 2012, with more than $60 million from Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce and the Center to Protect Patient Rights. This total included $7 million passed from Americans for Job Security through the Center to Protect Patient Rights. Of that amount, $4 million landed in a California ballot campaign committee.The Center to Protect Patient Rights, run by then-Koch point man Sean Noble, was used by Americans for Job Security to funnel money into the California ballot campaigns. The Virginia-based group sent $24 million through the Center to Protect Patient Rights. This contribution was split into the $7 million to the American Future Fund and $13 million to Americans for Responsible Leadership, both of which then passed contributions onto California groups.Another disappearing group, the 60 Plus Association, formed in the early 1990s as a conservative counter to the AARP, was largely funded by the Koch network. The organization received more than $18 million from Freedom Partners and the Center to Protect Patient Rights in 2012, and spent $13 million on election and issue ads attacking federal candidates. In 2014, the 60 Plus Association has spent $525,000 on advertising that targets members of Congress and other congressional candidates. The group's big advertising campaign opposing a mortgage reform bill sponsored by Sens. Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) and Tim Johnson (D-S.D.) led to a rebuke by its funders. According to The Associated Press, political advisers in the Koch network were ""frustrated"" by the advertisements. The 60 Plus Association didn't respond to a request for comment.Anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist's Americans for Tax Reform, meanwhile, has gone from spending $15.8 million in the 2012 election to less than $40,000 on the 2014 midterms. Crossroads GPS, a nonprofit founded by Karl Rove, provided $26.4 million to Americans for Tax Reform in what was supposed to be non-political spending. Norquist's group, however, spent more than half of its funds on electoral advertisements, while claiming on tax filings to the Internal Revenue Service to have spent less than one-third of its funds on election ads.The controversial spending by Americans for Tax Reform has seemingly led to the end of its role as a dark money front. The group didn't answer an inquiry from The Huffington Post. In an email conversation with New York Times reporter Tom Edsall, Crossroads spokesman Paul Lindsay wrote that the group has ""implemented stricter due diligence"" in determining which groups to fund.Lindsay provided a statement to The Huffington Post: ""Like labor unions, we invest in a number of organizations that have complementary missions that help us advance our issue agenda. Our grants to other 501c4’s, which are made public in our 990, are predicated on a review of their financial records and a stipulation that the funds only be used for their exempt activity and not for political purposes.""While American Future Fund, Americans for Job Security, Americans for Tax Reform and 60 Plus Association appear to have stopped being conduits for big sources of undisclosed money in federal elections, they remain a useful resource for other sources of money.For Americans for Job Security and Americans for Tax Reform, the plan has been to simply go back to engaging in their declared social welfare purpose: Advancing a conservative anti-tax, anti-union and pro-business agenda. Americans for Job Security is registered as a business trade association and has a long history of serving as a hired gun for corporations. Americans for Tax Reform has its staple of anti-tax policies to promote, including Norquist's Taxpayer Protection Pledge, and has also done work for industry lobbying campaigns, including tobacco companies.The two pro-business groups have, however, found themselves on opposite ends of business lobbying battles in Washington. Americans for Job Security, a routine ally of the retail industry, supported rules limiting swipe fees imposed on stores for customer debit card purchases in 2011, and backs the current proposal to allow states to impose a sales tax on online purchases. Americans for Tax Reform took opposite positions on both issues.The 60 Plus Association appears to have maintained a place in the orbit of Noble, who was excommunicated from the Koch network following his involvement in the California investigation and his exorbitant consulting fees. The seniors group ran ads in the Arizona Republican gubernatorial primary attacking opponents of the eventual nominee Doug Ducey. What remains of Noble's nonprofit network had mobilized outside support for Ducey.In Iowa, the American Future Fund continues to operate as a front for whomever has the funds. It received $750,000 from the Judicial Crisis Network, a conservative group promoting a right-wing judiciary and supporting Republican candidates in state attorney general races, and promptly gave $670,000 to the Republican Attorneys General Association, according to IRS documents.After pro-gun control groups ran ads blasting Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) for opposing background check legislation, the American Future Fund launched an advertising blitz on her behalf. Prior to and during the ad campaign, the nonprofit received $125,000 from the leadership PACs of Ayotte's Senate Republican colleagues.The group spent $287,000 to boost Nebraska state Sen. Beau McCoy's campaign for the Republican gubernatorial nomination -- likely at the behest of McCoy's sole donor: Nebraska businessman Charles Herbster. When asked by the Omaha World-Herald whether he funded the American Future Fund ads, Herbster said, ""That's one of the questions I'm going to take the Fifth Amendment on, OK?"" McCoy ultimately lost the GOP nomination to Pete Ricketts.American Future Fund's most recent advertising campaign is a far cry from its history of backing conservative candidates. For the past three months, the nonprofit has run ads in newspapers including Politico and The Wall Street Journal as part of a lobbying campaign by Doral Financial Corp., a Puerto Rican bank. The bank is in a spat with the commonwealth government over a refund for overpaid tax bills it says it is due, and hired the DCI Group, a PR firm with longstanding ties to the American Future Fund, to pressure Congress to intervene on its behalf.And so the world of dark money nonprofits turns."

Keeping meals and snacks consistent is a good way to stabilize energy levels and maintain digestion, but as the seasons change so does the temperature and availability of many foods, likes fruits and vegetables.There is no need to change the blueprint of your meals as far as your distribution of carbohydrate, protein, and fat, but instead change the sources of these forms of energy. Just like it is important to have your oil changed to help your car run better, it is a great idea to change up the components of meals to maximize your vitamin, mineral and antioxidant intake. With cool spring mornings a thing of the past, swap your warm bowl of oatmeal for a refreshing yogurt parfait or smoothie. Choose a yogurt of your choice for the base. I recommend a plain Greek yogurt in order to skip the added sugar from flavored versions and boost the protein to keep you full and help maintain your energy throughout the morning. Go for non-fat or 0-percent fat if you are watching overall calories or limiting saturated fat. Next, layer on colorful fruits. Fruits are ""functional foods"" because they not only provide nutrients our bodies need, but they also contain phytonutrients, components of plant-based foods that illicit positive health benefits. The more colors you choose the more nutrients you will consume. Let's go through the rainbow of seasonal summer fruits:Red/pink: cherries, grapefruit, grapes, nectarine, strawberries, raspberries, watermelon. Grapefruit and watermelon are excellent sources of lycopene which has been shown to have heart and prostate protective benefits. Berries, cherries and grapes contain anthocyanins, which research has shown can decrease post exercise muscle damage and may help support brain health.Orange: apricots, cantaloupe, peaches. Orange fruits are a rich source of beta-carotene, which helps to boost our bodies antioxidant defense by neutralizing damaging free radicals. Green: grapes, honeydew, limes. Grapes are packed with a variety of flavonoids that promote heart health and enhance antioxidant defense.Blue: blueberries. Blueberries are one the most nutrient-dense foods you can choose because they contain five classes of phytonutrients that offer antioxidant and antinflammatory benefits.Purple: blackberries, plums. Blackberries contain many of the same phytonutrients as blueberries. Plums are high in vitamin C. Adequate intake of vitamin C is important all year around, so keep plums on your grocery list this summer. Other great ""functional food"" additions to your summer meals are nuts and seeds. Almonds and walnuts are praised for providing heart healthy fats which offer heart protective benefits, but the truth is all nuts contain heart healthy fat, not to mention protein and fiber. Be outrageous and try pecans, pistacios, peanuts, or macadamia nuts! Ground flaxseed is a great staple to incorporate in a healthy diet as a source of omega 3 fats and soluble fiber, but chia and hemp seeds are two types to consider. Chia seeds are also a source of omega-3 fat and fiber, but one tablespoon has more protein, calcium and iron than flaxseed. Plus, they can be eaten whole or ground, while flaxseed has to be ground. Hemp seeds' perk is that they are a plant-based complete protein source, meaning they contain all essential amino acids, which many plant-based protein sources lack. Vegetables are also ""functional foods"" that are in prime season. All vegetables offer the same positive health benefits as fruits do. Summer is the time to transition from roasting vegetables in the oven and adding them to soups, to picking veggies straight from the garden to eat raw, grill, add to salads, sandwiches, grain or bean salads, or even use in cold soups like gazpacho. If you are like most Americans who choose vegetables as the smallest portion on your plate, I urge you to make an effort to revamp your summer meals to incorporate more fresh vegetables. Here are some ways to add in vegetables • Breakfast o Add raw green leafy lettuce (spinach, baby kale, parsley), carrots, beets to smoothies o Add any fresh vegetable to omelets• Lunch o Add raw veggies to sandwiches, wraps o Pack side salad or raw veggies instead of chip or pretzels• Dinner o Add extra vegetables to pasta, potato, or grain salads o Throw veggies on the grill with your preferred protein source o Load kebobs with more vegetables than meat o Try a cold vegetable soup as a side dishBefore you head to your local grocery store or farmers market, I recommend planning a few new meals that incorporate functional foods and make a list accordingly. Choosing a variety of new and seasonal foods can help keep you happy and healthy all summer long."

Brooklyn will have to compete for the DNC alongside other cities including Philadelphia, PA and Columbus, OH.

""And by making it more secure, do what we’ve done in the rest of the city -- where you’ll come in and invest, where you will commit to areas of the city that years ago people thought you would’ve been crazy.”The News published an analysis on Tuesday that showed minorities are also disproportionately targeted for arrest in wealthy neighborhoods, not just low-income ones.New York Civil Liberties Union Executive Director Donna Lieberman said there's more to the NYPD's enforcement than cops going after whomever commits low-level offenses.""The NYPD’s targeting of New Yorkers of color for broken windows policing even in white neighborhoods exactly mirrors how the police department abuses stop-and-frisk,” Lieberman said in a statement sent to The Huffington Post. “Even in white neighborhoods, black and Latino New Yorkers are more likely to get stopped and interrogated than their white counterparts, and now we see the same thing is happening with summonses. This data confirms that there are two kinds of policing in New York City – one for white people, and one for everyone else.”Bratton is one of the forefathers of ""broken windows"" policing, a crime fighting strategy in which police aggressively go after low-level offenders, in the belief that this also cuts down on the number of more serious infractions.There are many criminologists who question whether broken windows is responsible for the drop in crime New York has experienced over the last 20-plus years.Stop and frisk, a procedure in which police stop and pat down people they reasonably suspect could be carrying something illegal, like a gun or drugs, was the subject of a recently settled lawsuit in which a judge found that minorities were being unfairly targeted.

McConnell is locked in a tight race against Democratic challenger Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8d5a3200000c70101d2d4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This story was published by The Center for Public Integrity, a nonprofit, nonpartisan investigative news organization in Washington, D.C.Don’t believe for a bluegrass minute that Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., is taking his challenge from Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes lightly.During the week following Labor Day, McConnell’s campaign aired, on average, one TV ad every five minutes — about 2,200 ads in all, according to a Center for Public Integrity review of data provided by Kantar Media/CMAG, an advertising tracking service.That’s roughly twice as many ads as Grimes’ campaign aired during the same period and more than any U.S. Senate candidate nationwide.But for Republicans, Kentucky’s big-money Senate contest is an anomaly during a week that saw Democrats and their allies produce more TV spots in most battleground states.It’s the latest indication that Democrats, who have long feared being outgunned this cycle, are willing to spend whatever’s necessary to prevent the GOP from seizing the six Senate seats it needs in November to win a Senate majority.During the week following Labor Day, Democrats and their allies aired significantly more TV ads in Alaska, Georgia, Michigan and North Carolina, according to estimates from Kantar Media/CMAG.In Arkansas, Colorado, Iowa and Louisiana, Democrats and their allies also edged out their rivals by narrower margins, airing less than 10 percent more TV ads than conservatives in each state during the week following Labor Day.To see a graph of last week's TV ads in the 2014 battle for the Senate, visit the Center for Public Integrity.Much of this air cover came from the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Senate Majority PAC and Vote Vets Action Fund.These three groups that exemplify the range of political players behind the advertising barrages in battleground states this year.The DSCC is an official arm of the Democratic Party. It discloses its funders and can only accept contributions no larger than $32,400 per donor per year.Senate Majority PAC and Vote Vets Action Fund, however, don’t have a limit on the size of donations they may receive. As a super PAC, Senate Majority PAC discloses its donors’ name, while Vote Vets Action Fund, as a “social welfare” nonprofit organized under Sec. 501(c)(4) of the U.S. tax code, does not. Both types of groups have flourished in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission ruling that loosened campaign spending rules for companies.Generally, candidates themselves may only accept $2,600 per donor per election, with a primary and general election counting as separate elections.To view a graph of total TV ads in the 2014 battle for the Senate through Sept. 8, go to the Center for Public Integrity.Super PACs are making their marks in other Senate races, too.In Virginia, for instance, incumbent Democratic Sen. Mark Warner is favored to win re-election but is being challenged by former Republican National Committee Chairman Ed Gillespie.But Warner’s allies aren’t taking chances, as a pro-Democratic super PAC called Virginia Progress PAC has roared to life, airing roughly 630 TV ads during the week following Labor Day — about 40 percent of all ads in the state during this period.Virginia Progress PAC has raised about $1.7 million this year, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Its largest donor? A limited liability company called Alcantara LLC, which, as the Huffington Post first reported, is owned by tech entrepreneur Michael Saylor, who is also Warner’s close friend.Meanwhile in New Hampshire, a quixotic super PAC that advocates for campaign finance reform failed to propel favored candidate Jim Rubens to victory in a Republican primary that former U.S. Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts easily won. He now faces incumbent Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen in what’s likely to be a close race.Mayday PAC argued it helped Rubens finish second and thrust campaign finance reform into the race’s spotlight. But Mayday PAC leader Lawrence Lessig acknowledged afterward, “We lost. Badly.”According to FEC records, the super PAC spent $1.6 million overall on various messaging to do so — or about $59 per vote Rubens received. That includes 70 TV ads — about one-fifth the number of ads Brown’s campaign aired — during the week after Labor Day, according to Kantar Media/CMAG. Rubens himself did not air TV ads.In the past week, Kansas also emerged as potential battleground state in the fight for control of the Senate.Democrat Chad Taylor dropped out of the race on Sept. 3, a move that some observers say could boost independent Greg Orman’s chances of defeating incumbent Republican Sen. Pat Roberts.In the week following Labor Day, Orman’s campaign aired about 450 ads, while Roberts’ campaign aired zero, according to Kantar Media/CMAG.To date, the better-funded Roberts has aired more than 3,800 ads, while Orman has aired about 2,700, including ads during Roberts’ heated GOP primary in August.Dave Levinthal contributed to this report."

That's where domestic violence usually occurs. We are disturbed by its aftermath -- the bruising, black eyes, broken bones -- but not enough to take real action as a team, a league, or even a nation.This week, after TMZ released the video of Baltimore Ravens' Ray Rice punching his then fiancé now wife Janay Palmer in the head and knocking her unconscious, the Ravens immediately released Rice and the NFL suspended him indefinitely. It was the right consequence but a knee-jerk reaction. Did the Ravens, the NFL or even the general public need to see the most recent video to know what happened inside the elevator to take action? Apparently. Wasn't it enough to see Ray Rice dump the unconscious Janay Palmer like a bag of garbage outside of the elevator, and then kick at her feet so the doors could close, and then render no assistance (or call for help) to know what happened inside the elevator? I guess not. But for the millions of Americans, myself included, who have witnessed domestic violence firsthand, the second video was not needed for us to know what happened behind those closed doors or to be outraged by the original slap on the wrist for Ray Rice. Forty years ago, I grew up in a home where domestic violence and child abuse took place on the level of torture -- at a time when there were no hotlines or shelters or laws in place to protect my mother from my father's wrath. At 12 years old, I went to my city's police department and disrobed in a roomful of male police officers. I was covered in bruises, welts and burns. They were shocked and horrified. Yet I was sent home that day with these words: ""It's a private family matter."" Why? Because the police needed to catch him in the act to make an arrest or take action against my father. Did such constraints influence the Ravens' and the NFL's response this week? Maybe. Thankfully, with legislation, protective services and even abuse prevention campaigns, much has changed over the last four decades. We should acknowledge that the movement to end violence against women and domestic violence was championed and led by women. The news this week brings a reminder that it's time for men, all men, to be a part of the solution. This horrific event, caught on camera, of violence against a woman gives men an extraordinary opportunity to further the conversation about what it means to be a real man; in particular, it's time to talk about the role male athletes play at every level of sports. In male culture, many men and young boys look at male athletes as the true definition of masculinity and success. We desperately need more real men to stand up and lead on the field, in the locker rooms, and in their communities -- as champions in the movement to end all forms of violence, especially in ending violence against women. The response to the second Ray Rice assault video from many current and former professional athletes -- the more visible as well as the lesser known -- gives me hope. As a former football player at the college and professional levels (Florida State Seminoles and the Miami Dolphins), I know the culture firsthand. The public assumes that we play a violent game and we lack the social or moral components to shut down the violence off the field. Nothing could be further from the truth. The overwhelming percentage of professional athletes, including football players, are good men, husbands and fathers; many of them giving their free time to charitable causes. The media has a propensity to cover the ""bad boys."" After all, much as we try, it's hard to resist watching the train wrecks. But here's the problem: the majority of those male athletes who are outstanding role models for our young boys and young men are not standing up and raising their voices when it comes to ending violent and disrespectful behavior towards women. Many times, they'll rally around a Ray Rice and even say that it's ""a private family matter,"" or a private team issue. It's not. It is, in fact, a public matter. Domestic violence impacts the entire community. One in three women in the United States will be a victim of a violent crime in their lifetime. Those women are your mothers, daughters, sisters, girlfriends and wives. This week we commemorated the 20 year anniversary of the Violence Against Women Act. I urge all citizens to contact your legislators and make sure that they support the Act and that they vote to fund the vitally important services covered by VAWA. It's also time that the NFL and all of our sports programs implement policies that are applied consistently for players who commit acts of violence. Most of all, I want to urge us to continue the conversation about what we as men can and should do to play our part in creating safer relationships, homes and communities. It's simple. How we treat women in our society is a measure of our collective character. Stand up and raise your voices to end violence against all women, rich and poor, black or white, straight or gay. Be a ""real"" man."

Her lawyers also reportedly told TMZ that if it is the rapper in the video then it was possibly shot ""without her knowledge or consent,"" possibly while she was a minor.Well, this all sounds terrible. Completely terrible. EARLIER: Reps for Iggy Azalea slammed reports that the 24-year-old Australian rapper ever made a sex tape. “It is categorically not Iggy Azalea in the video in question. She has never been involved in any sexually explicit recordings,"" Azalea's rep wrote in an email to HuffPost Entertainment. Azalea's rep denied such a video exists following a TMZ report that Vivid Entertainment reached out to the rapper to negotiate ""what could be a multi-million dollar deal,"" though the company was also told it was not the musician in the footage it had obtained. Just two weeks ago, nude photos of many celebrities -- including Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton -- were hacked from their iCloud accounts and shared online. Iggy herself took to Twitter later on Sept. 11 to further slam rumors regarding the alleged sex tape."
