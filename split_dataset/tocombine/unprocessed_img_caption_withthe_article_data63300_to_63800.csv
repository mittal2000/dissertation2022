Martin Molin is using his -- 2,000 to be exact.The Sweden-based musician has spent the last 14 months working on a musical instrument that uses marbles to play both melody and rhythm.Molin officially unveiled his ""Marble Machine"" on Feb. 29 with a YouTube video featuring an original instrumental composition.The Rube Goldberg-like instrument is played by a crank that lifts the marbles up to the top so they can roll down.The Marble Machine is versatile: Molin is able to make it play bass, percussion and a vibraphone using a series of levers that direct the rolling marbles where he wants them.The 33-year-old was inspired to build his machine after visiting a museum with mechanical instruments in Utrecht, Netherlands.""I always loved the Marble Machine subculture and when I knew how to cut wooden gears I wanted to build this machine,"" he told The Huffington Post via email. ""I think it was when I was watching a marble machine video on YouTube that I thought, 'It would be nice to be able to program the falling pattern of the marbles and let them fall on different musical notes.'""Molin built the machine himself, even taking on the expense of buying various woodworking tools, including a bandsaw, table saw and drill press.""After putting the machinery together I started with the programming wheel and then built the whole machine around that,"" he said.Considering that Molin was building an instrument he had never played, composing on it was a bit of a challenge.Luckily, he learned the nuances of the instrument during the construction process.""I was test composing constantly during the whole time,"" he said. ""It is quite quick to reprogram but it takes a lot of concentration to put the nails on the right places.""Molin says songwriting on his Marble Machine was a challenge because the instrument only allowed compositions of a certain length.""With other instruments you are totally free to do whatever but these limitations on the marble machine act as a starting point, something to be creative with,"" he said.He also had to figure out the right amount of marbles to make the machine work best.""I first bought 500 which I thought was plenty,"" he said. ""Then I reordered 500 again three times over.""Molin, who plays with a band called Wintergatan, would like to take the instrument out on the road with him, but that's not going to work.""The machine is too big to travel with,"" he said. ""Right now I can not get it out through the door from the place I built it in without deconstructing it. I will build a smaller motorized music box that we will take with us on tour and it will act as a fifth member of the band."""
1,POLITICS,Don’t Assume Bernie Sanders Supporters Will Back Hillary Clinton If She’s The Nominee,Samantha-Jo Roth,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-supporters-wont-vote-hillary_us_56d7571ae4b0871f60edb9fe,Some of the Vermont senator's fans would rather not vote -- or even vote for Donald Trump -- than vote for Hillary.,2016-03-02,Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has many supporters who wouldn't shift their loyalty to Hillary Clinton if she triumphs over him in the Democratic presidential primary. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ST. PAUL, Minnesota -- A horde of Bernie Sanders supporters at a local pub were watching closely as the Super Tuesday election results rolled in, a few booing as Hillary Clinton’s smiling face, accompanied by a green check mark, repeatedly flashed across the screens. When they learned their candidate had beaten Hillary Clinton in Minnesota, taking the largest share of the state’s available delegates, they chanted and cheered the Vermont senator’s name -- and many vowed never to support his opponent, even if she goes on to win the Democratic nomination.“I will never support Hillary Clinton,” said Adam Burch, 28, of Minneapolis. “I identify as a socialist. She stands for everything that I’m against. It’s Bernie or nothing.”Burch isn’t alone. He's part of a group on social media called Grassroots Action for Bernie that has promised to support only Sanders in the election, using the hashtag “BernieorBust” to spread its message. Similarly, 50,000 people have signed an online pledge to write in Sanders’ name or vote for the Green Party candidate in the general election if the former Secretary of State wins the nomination.If that happens, some in this crowd are willing to go a step further in the general election and cast their ballot for Republican front-runner Donald Trump.“I would vote for Donald Trump over Hillary Clinton in a heartbeat,” said Patt Coltem, 60, of St. Paul. “She’s just too shady. She’s a pathological liar.""Although the Democratic front-runner has adopted much of Sanders’ platform, Coltem acknowledges that she cannot vote for Clinton. Clinton is still the establishment-backed candidate, and her ties to Wall Street and refusal to release transcripts of her paid speeches is feeding a growing mistrust among voters. Coltem said Donald Trump’s outsider status makes him a little bit more appealing.""He’s the only other person in this race who doesn’t have someone backing him,” Coltem explained. “Trump is crazy; he does a lot of weird stuff. I would prefer not to vote for him for president, but that’s how much I dislike Hillary Clinton.”Not all Bernie Sanders supporters agree. Some admitted they would vote for Clinton if she won the Democratic nomination because they’d like to see another Democrat in the White House.“I’m a lifelong Democrat, and I can’t see myself voting to support any of those wack-a-doos on the Republican side,” said Carol Wilcox, 77, as she waited for her precinct caucus to begin at Highland Park Middle School. “I’ve voted blue all my life and I will continue to do so, no matter how much I dislike Hillary Clinton.”Many of Sanders’ voters say they have felt slighted by the Democratic Party, pointing to DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s support for Clinton in 2008 and her investigation into the DNC voter files a week ahead of the Iowa caucuses, which they believe was an effort to undermine Sanders' chances at the nomination.Catherine Pollock, 30, of St. Paul says she doesn’t believe the DNC will embrace meaningful reforms to campaign finance or income inequality without Sanders’ leadership, which is why he's the only option for her.“I will not be voting for Hillary Clinton in November if she becomes the nominee,” Pollock explained. “I’ll either write in Bernie’s name or decide to not vote at all.”Signs of growing resentment against Clinton among Sanders backers emerged early in the cycle at an annual fundraiser for the Iowa Democratic Party last October. Thousands of supporters sat on bleachers, listening to speeches from each Democratic candidate running for president, but even before Clinton took the stage, Sanders’ supporters headed toward the exits. As Clinton mingled with voters after wrapping up on stage, not a single person remained in Sanders' cheering section.At a Sanders rally on caucus night in Iowa a month ago, a crowd booed loudly as TV monitors around the room showed Hillary Clinton giving her speech. When Clinton said she was a progressive, voters began chanting “she’s a liar,” before the campaign turned off the live stream.A CBS/New York Times poll released in January found less than than half of Democratic voters nationwide said they would enthusiastically support Hillary Clinton if she were to become the Democratic nominee. Fourteen percent would not support her in the general election, 27 percent would support her with “some reservations,” and 11 percent said they would only back her if she becomes the nominee.Sanders supporters sipping on craft beer in downtown Minneapolis on Tuesday night said they were still optimistic that their candidate could be the Democratic nominee, pointing out that a win in Minnesota is a huge boost for the senator, who received about 60 percent of the state’s delegates.“Hillary has won states that vote Republican in the general,” Burch said. “Bernie has won states that are more progressive than the mainstream. He’s done extremely well in the Midwest and I expect him to do well in some of the Western states. It’s not over until it’s over.”Many Sanders supporters believe their candidate is the most electable, and warn that a Clinton Democratic nomination would greatly benefit the Republican nominee, especially if it is Donald Trump.“If Bernie wins the nomination, all of these Republicans that are not fans of Trump would probably vote for Bernie,” Patt Coltem explained. “The Republican hatred for Hillary Clinton outweighs their disapproval of Trump, and they would do anything to defeat her.”"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), and California businessman Roque “Rocky” De La Fuente, who registered with the local Democratic party. As many voters headed to the polls during Super Tuesday, American Samoa was the first of five contests held in the United States territories.American Samoans cannot vote in the general election in November, but they can participate in presidential primaries. The territory consists of a group of small islands about 2,500 miles from Hawaii.This year, American Samoans will send 11 delegates to the Democratic National Convention. Six of these delegates were selected on Tuesday.Unlike the caucuses that are held in the states, which consist of many different locations, the Democratic Caucus in American Samoa only took place in the Tradewinds Hotel in the capital of Pago Pago for a two-hour period. In 2008, Clinton won the American Samoa Caucus against then-Sen. Barack Obama.On Tuesday, Clinton called into the American Samoa's sole caucus site, according to a campaign aide.""She also highlighted her commitment to breaking down barriers and building ladders of opportunity for the people of American Samoa -- specifically citing her commitment to raise incomes and tackle the epidemic of substance abuse,"" the aide said.Republicans in the U.S. territory will hold their party’s caucus on March 22."

5,POLITICS,Texans Voting On Super Tuesday Have To Abide By A Racist Voter ID Law,Samantha Lachman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/texas-voter-id-law_us_56d5d1e9e4b03260bf78357f,"More than 600,000 people don't have an acceptable form of ID to vote in the primary.",2016-03-01,"Voters line up to cast their ballots on Super Tuesday, March 1, 2016, in Fort Worth, Texas.

But Texans will still have to present one of a handful of acceptable forms of government-issued photo ID Tuesday when they go to vote in the state’s primary.Texas passed its strict voter ID law in 2011, but it was blocked by a federal court under a now-defunct provision of the VRA that required the state to get federal pre-approval for any changes to its election laws. In August 2012, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals ruled that the law would impose “strict, unforgiving burdens” on low-income voters of color. But Texas was able to implement the law in 2013 anyway, after the Supreme Court gutted that section of the VRA in a controversial 5-4 decision. The law is more strict than other states’ photo ID laws because it deems only a few forms of photo IDs acceptable. IDs from state universities don’t count, for example, but handgun licenses do. Courts have found that more than 600,000 eligible voters in the state lack an acceptable form of ID. Republicans who passed the law say that voter ID laws prevent voter fraud, even though documented cases of in-person voter impersonation are exceedingly rare. Democrats and civil rights advocates meanwhile, argue that Texas' requirements disproportionately affect people who are less likely to have the acceptable forms of ID, such as people of color, students, seniors and people with disabilities.The Texas law is also more likely to present a challenge for women, who may not have the documentation to prove that they had name changes when they got married or divorced, and for low-income people, who may not have birth certificates or other forms of documentation needed to get an ID.Republicans in the state legislature agreed to create a new form of ID called an election identification certificate, or EIC, which would be provided free to eligible voters. But as The Texas Observer reports, the state Department of Public Safety has issued just 653 EICs, or only one ID for every 1,200 Texans who lack an eligible form of ID to vote.In October 2014, a federal judge called the state’s voter ID law a ""poll tax” that was intentionally discriminatory, ruling that it was an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote. But the Supreme Court refused to intervene, allowing the law to remain in effect for that November’s midterm election. As The Huffington Post documented, the law did, in fact, prevent Texans from voting in that election. In August 2015, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit found that the law violated Section 2 of the VRA, which prohibits election procedures that discriminate on the basis of race or color. The justices avoided making a judgment to whether Texas legislators had a discriminatory purpose in passing the law, so they sent that question back to a lower federal court to re-evaluate its determination that lawmakers had been intentionally discriminatory.The appeals court suggested that the lower federal court could either reinstate voter registration cards as documents that allow someone to cast a ballot, or allow voters to sign an affidavit saying they do not have an acceptable form of identification before they can vote, as other states with less stringent voter ID laws do. Texas is appealing the court’s decision and asking the entire 5th Circuit to hear the case. If the court declines to hear the case with all of its justices, Texas will likely appeal to the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, as the litigation process remains ongoing, Texas voters without an acceptable form of ID will be disenfranchised again on Tuesday."

Rockefeller's great-granddaughter doesn't want shares in a company that's ""really hurting the world.""",2016-03-01,"Neva Rockefeller Goodwin speaks at a ceremony in Mount Desert, Maine, May 22, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Neva Rockefeller Goodwin was born into a family whose ancestors built the American oil industry. But now she's taking steps to direct some of the family's considerable wealth away from oil and toward addressing climate change.Goodwin, the great-granddaughter of oil magnate John D. Rockefeller, recently gave away all her stock in ExxonMobil to one of the family's foundations. The Rockefeller Family Fund, led by other descendants of the late oil baron, sold the stocks for $400,000 and will use the proceeds for its environmental work.Goodwin is an economist with a focus on sustainable development. She's also the co-director of the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University. She was inspired by the recent reporting from Inside Climate News and the Los Angeles Times that found that Exxon's experts knew that burning fossil fuels was causing climate change, but the company hid that information for decades and publicly worked to undermine the science. Exxon has denied the assertions and says the reporting mischaracterizes the company's position on climate change.Her decision to dump her shares in the company, Goodwin says, was both a financial matter and a moral one, as fossil fuels are no longer a sound investment. ""This was practical move, as well as one driven by my sense of what's wrong and right in the world,"" Goodwin told The Huffington Post.Her great-grandfather's company, Standard Oil, was split following a 1911 Supreme Court antitrust case, out of which emerged Exxon. Rockefeller's holdings in the company were part of the fortune he amassed in his lifetime.Goodwin's Exxon shares had been placed in a trust for her in 1954, she said. And while she doesn't feel ""deeply identified with Exxon,"" she said she does ""feel some heightened sense of responsibility.""""There's a strong argument that the use of fossil fuels had a big role in increasing standards of living. That's all good, but that was the 20th century,"" Goodwin said. ""I'm not happy owning stocks that have benefited me in the past, but [that] are really hurting the world in the present and the future.""She likes to think that her great-grandfather would have seen the need to shift away from fossil fuels, too. ""He was a very, very clear-eyed and practical person,"" she said. ""I am certain that faced with the realities, he would say, 'Of course we have to invest heavily in alternative sources of energy.' It's the practical answer.""In the past, Goodwin and other relatives tried to sway the company as shareholders, lobbying its leaders to pay attention to climate change. But they were not successful. In February, Goodwin announced her decision to drop her Exxon stock in an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times.She's not sure that abandoning the holdings outright will have much of an impact either.""They are pretty darn impervious to what anybody thinks,"" she said.But she hopes that the recent reporting on the company will help.""If all these things together create a groundswell of public opinion, that may finally get to the point where Exxon has to pay attention,"" Goodwin said. ""They have been very good at not paying attention for decades."""

(The CBC's PAC endorsed Clinton a few weeks ago, and its leaders said they believe Sen. Bernie Sanders' socialism is not a sufficient solution to eradicate the country's racism.)Wasserman Schultz did not endorse a candidate, since as party chair she must remain neutral. More broadly, she worried that the leading Republican candidates would create a national atmosphere similar to that of post-World War II McCarthyism, when Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin launched aggressive attacks against suspected communists, often falsely scapegoating people.The DNC chair has previously accused Republicans like Trump of not having depth or substance in their campaigns and relying on inflammatory words instead.""America is better than this. Better than Donald Trump or Marco Rubio or [Ted] Cruz or any of the slime that are oozing all over our Constitution and our future. We are not going to let it happen,"" Wasserman Schultz said. Editor's Note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

""It's quite another possibility for the other significant political party in this country to nominate someone who will actually unravel American values.""Butterfield explained that the election -- specifically the need to vote Democrat -- was in the hands of people like those in the crowd.""Who occupies the White House, beginning in 2017, will have the unrest of the world at her or his hands. This is a critically important election,"" Butterfield said. ""The Republicans are choosing their nominee as we speak, and I think it's going to be the worst nightmare of our lifetime. This election is in your hands.""Butterfield briefly argued that former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton would be the best option for the Democratic Party. (The CBC's PAC endorsed Clinton a few weeks ago, and its leaders said they believe Sen. Bernie Sanders' socialism is not a sufficient solution to eradicate the country's racism.)Wasserman Schultz did not endorse a candidate, since as party chair she must remain neutral. More broadly, she worried that the leading Republican candidates would create a national atmosphere similar to that of post-World War II McCarthyism, when Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin launched aggressive attacks against suspected communists, often falsely scapegoating people.The DNC chair has previously accused Republicans like Trump of not having depth or substance in their campaigns and relying on inflammatory words instead.""America is better than this. Better than Donald Trump or Marco Rubio or [Ted] Cruz or any of the slime that are oozing all over our Constitution and our future. We are not going to let it happen,"" Wasserman Schultz said. Editor's Note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

Scott Rigell (R-Va.) urged his fellow Republicans to pick anyone but Donald Trump in the primary elections, adding that he refuses to back the real estate mogul even if Trump becomes the GOP nominee for president. Rigell emailed his supporters on Tuesday, the day Virginia's primary voters head to the polls. ""Trump is a bully, unworthy of our nomination,"" Rigell wrote. ""My love for our country eclipses my loyalty to our party, and to live with a clear conscience I will not support a nominee so lacking in the judgement, temperament and character needed to be our nation's commander-in-chief. Accordingly, if left with no alternative, I will not support Trump in the general election should he become our Republican nominee.""The third-term congressman, who has announced that he's not running for re-election, pointed to Trump's recent refusal to disavow former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, his admiration for Russian leader Vladimir Putin and his frequent hurling of insults at the other candidates. ""Never before have I grabbed a word like catastrophic to make a political point,"" Rigell wrote. ""It's like pulling a fire alarm; if you do it, there had better be a fire. There is a fire and it's raging within our Republican party. I am convinced that if Donald Trump becomes our nominee, the harm done to our party would be nothing short of catastrophic.""Republicans are becoming increasingly worried that Trump remains their front-runner and could clinch the nomination. Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) was the first sitting senator to say he will not back Trump even if he becomes the nominee, releasing a statement on Sunday that was similar to Rigell's. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has not publicly disavowed Trump, but The New York Times reported that McConnell has come up with a plan for lawmakers to break with Trump if he gets the nomination. Trump also received his first congressional endorsements this week, when Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and Reps. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.) and Duncan Hunter (R-Calif.) backed him. Rigell's full open letter: Never before have I grabbed a word like catastrophic to make a political point. It's like pulling a fire alarm; if you do it, there had better be a fire. There is a fire and it's raging within our Republican party.

It is a necessity.""",2016-03-01,"Pamela Lewis' new book, <em>Teaching While Black</em>, argues for teachers who aren't colorblind.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d086f71e00002200702da6.png?cache=8Jq3ERCJj2&ops=crop_0_6_423_377%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Pamela Lewis isn't like most of her fellow teachers. Lewis is black. She's from the North Bronx and grew up in housing projects. She attended schools in which it was not a given that students would go on to colleges and careers.So, in a country where only 17 percent of K-12 public school teachers identify as minorities, she believes she has rare and valuable insight into the issues facing students of color. In her book to be published this month, Teaching While Black: A New Voice on Race and Education in New York City, she argues that educators should refuse to be colorblind and should give deep consideration to their students' racial backgrounds. ""I pray this book will help you to never be so naive as to think that racism has no grip on your classroom,"" Lewis writes. ""I simply ask you to see us, and to promote our children's ability to see themselves. Instilling black pride is not a threat. It is a necessity.""Teaching While Black makes a broad call for a more culturally responsive curriculum. In detailing Lewis' own experiences during her first decade of teaching in New York's public schools, it takes readers inside classrooms where students are sometimes distressingly poor and deeply uncomfortable in their own skin. The Huffington Post spoke to Lewis about her new book and why more teachers should embrace race in the classroom.What made you decide to write this book?I've read a few teacher memoirs over the years, and they're typically by white men and women. I wrote Teaching While Black because I wanted to show a perspective from a teacher of color. I'm experiencing the joys and stresses of teaching differently than other teachers -- [teaching] as a black woman from the same community as my students. Being a woman of color, I bring different things, including my own history and my style, to the table. I really wanted to write the book with students of color in mind. I've been thinking a lot about this over the past few days after seeing a few things happening on social media. It seems like there's an awakening among many black folk. We really feel like it's our time to control our own destiny when we see things happening around us. We're kind of fed up, we're angry, we're passionate about what we're seeing because we want change to happen.Why did you decide to go into education?I really always knew I wanted to help my community. That was a driving passion -- I've always been somewhat of an activist. I knew I wanted to help people of color, and it became very clear that the way to do it was through education.As someone who grew up in the same type of community as a lot of your students, what are the things you're able to see in your students that someone else might miss?One thing that sticks out for me is understanding the need to change the self-perception of black and brown students. I speak about this lack of self-love that many of our children face as a result of living in a white supremacist world. I think sometimes if you don't have that perspective, you might not necessarily pick up on how many times it rears its ugly head. If we had more black and brown leadership that knew how to speak to these issues, then we could have a massive shift in our children's state of minds, which would only bring forth greater achievement.It's not that I don't think white teachers can be change agents. That's not what I'm saying at all. But at the same time, don't tell me you think you totally get my students in the same capacity that I could. It's nothing against you. We need to have more faces of color showing students where we came from and how we still were able to achieve despite where we came from. I don't want students to grow up thinking that white people are the gatekeepers of education. When they only see white teachers, they think education is whiteness, and that sends a message, and that's the wrong message to send.I read a report that talked about how teachers of color are more likely to leave the profession. What, in your experience, contributes to this trend?I think that the same way that our current school system is disengaging to our students of color, it's disengaging to our teachers of color as well. There are many teachers or potential teachers that take issue with the current system of micromanagement or the lack of respect for teacher expertise.It's not that only teachers of color feel that. I think that pressure is something all teachers are feeling. But considering that there's a legacy of us being controlled in this country, the history that we bring to the classroom makes it even worse and makes it even more difficult for some of us to handle.Research shows that New York City has the most racially segregated schools in the country. How do you think that impacts your students?We have people who are poor among all races. But when you live in areas of concentrated poverty, and all the people around you are not just poor but all black and brown, it sends a message. They think all poor people are black and brown. The only time they see people who are not of that color, they are their teachers.To them, if you're smart, you're ""acting white."" If you're pretty, you ""look white."" It's really screwing up their self-image. This interview has been edited for length and clarity."
13,POLITICS,Advocates Fire Back After Judge Rules Filming Police Isn't A First Amendment Right,Andy Campbell,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/filming-police-isnt-a-first-amendment-right-federal-judge-rules_us_56d5d57ce4b03260bf783785,The decision flies in the face of previous rulings.,2016-03-01,"A Philadelphia police officer on duty on Jan. 8, 2016. A federal judge ruled in February that citizens don't have a First Amendment right to record police if they aren't explicitly challenging officers' conduct.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d6066a1e0000b300703253.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Free speech advocates say a federal judge's recent ruling on the right to film police officers on the street won't set any legal precedent, but they still call it way out of line.Last month, U.S. District Judge Mark Kearney ruled that citizens are not protected by the constitution when they film police officers -- unless they're doing it for the purpose of criticizing police activity.In the decision, Kearny concluded:We have not found, and the experienced counsel have not cited, any case in the Supreme Court or this [Third Circuit] finding citizens have a First Amendment right to record police conduct without any stated purpose of being critical of the government ... We decline to create a new First Amendment right for citizens to photograph officers when they have no expressive purpose such as challenging police actions.The ruling stems from a lawsuit from two Philadelphia residents, Richard Fields and Amanda Geraci, who claim that their constitutional rights were violated when police took their cameras away as they recorded officers in action.Because the pair didn't identify a purpose for recording the officers beyond the fact that ""it was an interesting scene,"" Kearney writes, ""we find no basis to craft a new First Amendment right based solely on 'observing and recording.'"" Mary Catherine Roper, an attorney with the ACLU of Pennsylvania who represents Fields and Geraci, told The Huffington Post on Tuesday that Kearney's decision is contrary to Philadelphia's own policy of allowing citizens to record officers in public no matter what the situation. ""The reason we have these types of lawsuits in the first place is because police violate that policy,"" Roper said. ""The most important point of the First Amendment is to ensure that we can criticize our government.""That power hasn't been taken away by Kearney's decision, which does not set a legal precedent or overrule any higher federal court ruling -- and also does not find that filming police is illegal. However, it does differ from previous decisions in higher courts that consider recordings of police officers to be protected under the First Amendment. UCLA free speech professor Eugene Volokh made this point when he condemned Kearney's decision in The Washington Post last week.""Some restrictions on such recording may be constitutional, but simply prohibiting the recording because the person is recording the police can’t be constitutional,"" Volokh wrote. ""This is the view of all the precedential federal appellate decisions that have considered the issue.""Paul Hetznecker, a civil rights attorney who represented a photojournalist arrested for filming officers at a protest, told The Philadelphia Inquirer that he was ""surprised"" by Kearney's findings.""Gathering information for dissemination is a fundamental part of what we do under the First Amendment, and videotaping a police officer conducting their duties in a public space is a fundamental example of gathering information,” he said, adding that other federal judges in Philly have classified recording as a First Amendment right.Roper called Kearney's decision an ""outlier"" that will ""certainly"" be overturned when it hits the appellate courts. Indeed, the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals already reaffirmed that such recordings are protected in several decisions:[Previously], we held that the Constitution protects the right of individuals to videotape police officers performing their duties...The ruling could become dangerous, however, if it influences future decisions. But Roper says the rest of the country -- including higher courts, the Department of Justice and your average citizen -- finds filming public police events to be an act of free speech.""You do not need to change what you do on the street,"" she said. ""What you find is that sometimes the court system lags behind reality ... What we need going forward is very clear guiding authority from the Court of Appeals."""

Ted Cruz returned to his roots Monday night for a rally in the chapel auditorium of Houston Baptist University, where he was touted as a man of faith by his own pastor.After laudatory speeches from former Gov. Rick Perry (R) and current Gov. Greg Abbott (R), the senator bore witness to his faith -- ""I know the meaning of God’s grace through Jesus,"" he said -- and recited a long list of reasons why Donald Trump should not be the Republican presidential nominee.Conspicuous by its absence was any mention of Trump's reluctance to distance himself from David Duke, a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. Not a word from the preacherly Cruz about the evils -- for the country and the GOP -- of white supremacists. Nothing about the Christian teachings urging you to love your fellow man.Cruz has mostly gone missing in this fight. On Sunday, when the Trump-Duke controversy broke, he dutifully, if gingerly, joined the amen chorus of cautious denunciations of The Donald.""Really sad,"" Cruz tweeted of Trump's tepid reaction to Duke's endorsement of him. He sanctimoniously advised the front-running Trump, ""You're better than this. We should all agree, racism is wrong, KKK is abhorrent.""And that was it.While Florida Sen. Marco Rubio continues to hammer Trump on the issue of Duke and the KKK, and while other Republicans in Congress -- including House Speaker Paul Ryan -- express their dismay, Cruz hasn't picked up that line of attack. He hasn't done so even though his own Baptist denomination has a long and rich history of opposing slavery in the U.S. and the world. The reason is simple: On Super Tuesday, Cruz is fighting for every delegate he can get, and that means reaching out to every would-be GOP voter, even those with racist inclinations. In the South -- in such Super Tuesday battle sites as Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Arkansas and Texas -- the old term for them was segregationists, or ""segs."" You know one when you meet one: There's an undercurrent of deep and abiding resentment, a sense they are under siege in a ""cultural"" war with ""them,"" and the use of ""Washington"" and ""New York"" as code words for a federal system that puts ""them"" above you.The modern segregationists became a force in 1948, when South Carolina's ""Dixiecrat"" senator Strom Thurmond led his delegation out of the Democratic Party because it had placed a pro-integration plank in the platform. Those Dixiecrats became Republicans in the era of Ronald Reagan, who launched his 1980 campaign in Philadelphia, Mississippi, with a ""states' rights"" speech near the site where civil rights workers had been murdered in 1964.In later years, Republicans sought to hide those appeals to racial division behind the rhetoric of a ""Big Tent"" party, which the Bush family in particular saw as an outreach to Hispanic voters. They succeeded to a surprising degree in Texas, in Florida and in national elections.Trump is threatening to undo all of that. His governing metaphor isn't a tent; it's a wall.And Cruz isn't laying into the billionaire for it. Just the opposite. With only the merest gloss of legalism (he is, after all, a self-proclaimed constitutional scholar), Cruz is still trying to match Trump stride for stride on immigration, ""radical Islamic terrorism"" and race.He's hoping that will allow him to pick up delegates across the country on Super Tuesday, even if he doesn't actually win anywhere but Texas and Arkansas (his best hopes). He needs the old segs to get there.But if you've been to enough Trump and Cruz rallies -- and I've been to many of both -- you know from the tenor of the crowds that Cruz is fighting a losing battle for those votes.Trump has got 'em with his wild rhetoric, his jaw-jutting anger and his disdain. Cruz is too pious and too Ivy League to match his rival.His own crowds are full of wholesome, Bible-believing, church-attending types. They mostly are drawn to Cruz's message that he will use his legal skills to defend their freedom to worship as they please, where and when they please. It can be a positive message, showing the connection between secular and religious liberty, and it is what his supporters want to hear.I spoke to a young professional couple attending the rally that night. He's an Anglo non-denominational Christian; she's a devout Catholic from an old Texas Hispanic family. They want to be free to worship in the way they choose for themselves.They both abhor Donald Trump and his strident views about ""them."" They would have cheered Cruz had he denounced The Donald and Duke.But Ted was silent, in a chapel no less.Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

But Twitter says it uses an algorithm to automatically identify and promote trending topics, and remove ones that are no longer trending.""As elections approach in countries around the world we hear conspiracy theories about political trend manipulation, from activists on the left, the center, and right,"" a Twitter spokesman told The Huffington Post. ""But the actual reason a topic doesn’t trend is because its popularity isn’t as widespread as supporters believe.""Twitter's algorithm -- the internal workings of which are private -- ""uses multiple factors, such as the volume of discussion, freshness, and velocity,"" to pick trending topics, the spokesman explained. The algorithm tailors suggestions based on who a user follows, and where they're located. Users have the option of viewing what's trending elsewhere. Twitter designed the algorithm to promote topics that are newly popular over old ones that are discussed repeatedly by the same people. The #WhichHillary hashtag exploded after Ashley Williams, a black queer organizer, displayed the message on a sign while protesting a Clinton fundraiser this month. Williams was attacking Clinton's 1996 use of the word ""super-predators,"" a term that was used to paint black teenagers as being programmed to commit violent crimes and has since been debunked and criticized as racist. Clinton, who said last week that she ""shouldn't have used those words,"" is calling for criminal justice reform in 2016. Online activists are using the hashtag to draw attention to other issues where Clinton has appeared to waffle. On Friday, some activists claimed that Twitter had deliberately removed #WhichHillary, which was reportedly used over 68,100 times in a 14-hour period, from its list of trending topics. A chart provided by Twitter shows that the volume of tweets with that hashtag dropped off: Activists nonetheless pointed to a fundraising event Clinton was scheduled to attend earlier this month with Omid Kordestani, Twitter's executive chairman, to bolster claims the censorship was intentional. Users started using a second hashtag: #WhichHillaryCensored.""Twitter's decision to censor the trending #WhichHillary hashtag is the latest example of the corporate media's collusion with Hillary Clinton,"" Rudy Panko wrote in Russia Insider, a website with the tagline ""bias bashers."" Clinton's campaign did not respond to a request for comment.Guerrilla Socialists, a group that supports Clinton's competitor, Bernie Sanders, and was pushing the hashtag campaign, claimed that its account was suspended ""at the height of the #WhichHillary hashtag trend."" The group said it received a notice that its account was accidentally locked because it looked like it was spamming. Signs of spamming that Twitter looks for include a user following or unfollowing a large amount of accounts, tweeting out a lot of links or being blocked by a large number of people. ""We will suspend accounts that violate our spam policies, with zero regard for their political ideology or message,"" the Twitter spokesman said. A person who runs the Guerrilla Socialists account (who did not give a name, citing online harassment concerns) denied the account was used for spam, and claimed that beyond the algorithm, Twitter could take down a hashtag by suspending popular accounts. ""I can't say for certain what Twitter did to my account,"" the person told HuffPost. ""All I can say for certain is that I clearly did nothing wrong.""This isn't the first time activists have accused Twitter of censorship. The social network has been blamed for blocking hashtags related to Wikileaks, Occupy Wall Street and even Steve Jobs. ""Most of those who have looked at the issue are reassured that Twitter is not in fact censoring these topics,"" Tarleton Gillespie, a principal researcher at Microsoft Research New England, wrote in 2011. Gilad Lotan, chief data scientist at Betaworks, also wrote that year, ""what we’re seeing is an outcome of a purely algorithmic mechanism, with its built in biases, hence not always intuitive or logical."" Twitter promotes itself as a free speech platform, and has faced criticism for not censoring users fast enough -- like those who make racist or sexist threats, or who support the self-proclaimed Islamic State.With that said, ""persistence of the charge of censorship is not surprising at all,"" Gillespie wrote in 2011. ""Advocates of these political efforts want desperately for their topic to gain visibility."" "

According to the head of CBS, the foul-mouthed presidential candidate is ""damn good"" for the network and the ""money's rolling in"" thanks to his antics.Les Moonves, executive chairman and CEO of CBS, made the comments during a speech at the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom Conference in San Francisco, according to The Hollywood Reporter.""I've never seen anything like this, and this going to be a very good year for us,"" he said at the event. ""Sorry. It's a terrible thing to say. But, bring it on, Donald. Keep going.""The outlet notes Moonves said ad sales this season have been particularly strong, partly due to an election cycle rapt with attacks and ""bomb throwing"" that keeps Americans interested.""It may not be good for America, but it's damn good for CBS,"" he said.His comments reflect an ongoing media blitz that revels in lambasting the xenophobic, racist and often false comments Trump makes, but outlets still opt to put him on the air. The Huffington Post's Michael Calderone noted in September that the business mogul has long been afforded the privilege of calling in to many political programs.Some members of the media have also been chastised for being too soft on the candidate, who's been known to throw tantrums over negative coverage and threaten to blacklist reporters.Other Republican candidates, including Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), have struggled to keep up. The New York Times noted that the Florida senator has ramped up the mudslinging in an effort to scrounge some of the aggression -- and subsequent media salivation -- for himself.It appears to be working. CNN and Fox have both broken debate ratings records this election season and Trump's polling numbers are already crushing Mitt Romney's from 2012.Also on HuffPost:"

At 23, she's not particularly interested in cultural norms, between her face piercings and a psychedelic scarf draped around her neck over a mismatched shirt that exposes her belly button (and then some). She's also not scared of Republican candidate Donald Trump becoming president.""I think everybody else is a little more afraid than I'll ever imagine to be, because honestly, I don't think the world is going to come to a complete end if he is president,"" said Allen, her face decorated with glitter. ""But he does have to do something with that hair before he becomes president, if he does.""Allen said she has a free place to live in New Zealand if she wants.

This is House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's turf, where the crosswalks are painted like LGBT-friendly rainbows and people break apart their disposable Starbucks coffee cups before tossing them into three different color-coded trash bins -- for compost, recycling or landfill. Residents here actually celebrate diversity instead of demanding deportations and walls. It's as progressive as it gets.""The only Republican we have in town is Dianne Feinstein,"" said Connor Ryan, 60, making a crack about the state's semi-moderate Democratic senator.The Huffington Post spent Sunday afternoon in Haight-Ashbury, asking people like Allen and Ryan what they make of the racist, sexist, Islamophobic wave sweeping the nation -- otherwise known as the Trump campaign.It's a mood that runs counter to everything that this district, the birthplace of hippie subculture and free love, has traditionally represented. People's level of freak-out was as diverse as the city's residents, and their blunt assessments of Trump appear here uncensored.To Ryan, who has lived in San Francisco for 40 years and is now retired, Trump doesn't stand a chance of winning.""I'm fairly confident at this point that he won't get it because it's pretty much Hillary Clinton's or Bernie Sanders' race to lose,"" he said.

At 23, she's not particularly interested in cultural norms, between her face piercings and a psychedelic scarf draped around her neck over a mismatched shirt that exposes her belly button (and then some). She's also not scared of Republican candidate Donald Trump becoming president.""I think everybody else is a little more afraid than I'll ever imagine to be, because honestly, I don't think the world is going to come to a complete end if he is president,"" said Allen, her face decorated with glitter. ""But he does have to do something with that hair before he becomes president, if he does.""Allen said she has a free place to live in New Zealand if she wants. Her ex-boyfriend's mother lives there and is urging her to move in the event of a Trump presidency. Allen says she's overreacting.To be clear, though, this millennial is no fan of Trump: ""I think he's an idiot and he's a drama-stirring, reality show asshole.""If there's anywhere in America where Trump isn't winning, it's San Francisco. This is House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's turf, where the crosswalks are painted like LGBT-friendly rainbows and people break apart their disposable Starbucks coffee cups before tossing them into three different color-coded trash bins -- for compost, recycling or landfill. Residents here actually celebrate diversity instead of demanding deportations and walls. It's as progressive as it gets.""The only Republican we have in town is Dianne Feinstein,"" said Connor Ryan, 60, making a crack about the state's semi-moderate Democratic senator.The Huffington Post spent Sunday afternoon in Haight-Ashbury, asking people like Allen and Ryan what they make of the racist, sexist, Islamophobic wave sweeping the nation -- otherwise known as the Trump campaign.It's a mood that runs counter to everything that this district, the birthplace of hippie subculture and free love, has traditionally represented. People's level of freak-out was as diverse as the city's residents, and their blunt assessments of Trump appear here uncensored.To Ryan, who has lived in San Francisco for 40 years and is now retired, Trump doesn't stand a chance of winning.""I'm fairly confident at this point that he won't get it because it's pretty much Hillary Clinton's or Bernie Sanders' race to lose,"" he said. ""Trump is obviously right out of a book in terms of a demagogue. It's scary … But I think he's stoppable, unless Hillary Clinton totally screws up or Bernie Sanders screws up.""Others aren't so sure Democrats will prevail.

Republicans quickly decried the actions when they were announced in November 2014, and have attempted in the past to block funding for the programs. But filing a brief in the case before the Supreme Court is a more extreme response to what they say is Obama's unconstitutional ""amnesty"" for undocumented immigrants. ""This is a very extraordinary step. In fact, it has never been done before,"" Ryan said at a press conference after meeting with GOP members, adding the ""executive amnesty is a direct attack on"" Congress' powers to legislate. The programs are currently at a standstill because of a lawsuit from 26 states, led by Texas, that is set for consideration at the Supreme Court. Justices asked lawyers from the federal government and the states to address whether Obama violated the Constitution's ""take care"" clause, even though lower courts had not ruled on that matter. ""The president is not permitted to write law,"" Ryan said. ""Only Congress is. The House will make that very, very clear, and we will do so as an institution on behalf of the American people, on behalf of representative self-government."" Every Republican presidential candidate has vowed to end Obama's deportation relief programs, including one already in effect for young people who came to the U.S. as children, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.If allowed to go into effect, Obama's 2014 executive actions would have expanded DACA and created a new program for parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA.Obama has argued the programs fall within the administration's authority to set priorities and allow Immigration and Customs Enforcement to focus on deporting criminals and recent border-crossers rather than people with long-standing ties to the U.S."

But there are deep fissures inside the base as well and the GOP is poised to crack wide open….The strongest attacks on Trump charge that he is an ego-maniac who cares more about himself than the country, that he is very disrespectful towards women, and that he is a threat to national security and should not have control of our nuclear weapons.” [Democracy Corps]The establishment's inability to stop Trump could signal a Republican realignment - Nate Silver: ""If a Trump nomination happens, it will imply that the Republican Party has been weakened and is perhaps even on the brink of failure, unable to coordinate on a plan to stop Trump despite the existential threat he poses to it. Major partisan realignments do happen in America — on average about once every 40 years. The last one, which involved the unwinding of the New Deal coalition between Northern and Southern Democrats, is variously dated as having occurred in 1968, 1972 and 1980….It’s almost impossible to reconcile this year’s Republican nomination contest with anyone’s notion of 'politics as usual….' The rules of the old regime — the American political party system circa 1980 through 2012 — might not apply in the new one. [T]he assumption that the parties will rally behind their respective nominees may or may not be reliable….[W]e may be entering a new era, and through the broader sweep of American history, there’s sometimes been quite a bit of voting across party lines."" [538] WHAT TO WATCH IN SUPER TUESDAY COVERAGE - David Byler: “Watching primary and caucus results roll in on Tuesday night is going to feel like drinking from a firehose….If you’re not a veteran political journalist or a data geek, it might be tough to digest that cascade of information….On the Republican Side: Most Super Tuesday states allocate their delegates proportionally with a threshold of either 15 percent (Arkansas, Oklahoma) or 20 percent (Texas, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Vermont) of the vote. In other words, the state divides up its delegates proportionally between the candidates who surpass the threshold….In the Democratic primary, delegates are also awarded to the winner of each congressional district (or sometimes smaller political subdivisions)....If Clinton wins a state by driving up her margins in a few heavily or significantly African-American congressional districts, Sanders could still pick up a modest haul from the more numerous districts that are whiter and more rural. Clinton will almost assuredly win a substantial majority of the votes cast on Super Tuesday, but the data nerds will be watching how much those pad her delegate lead."" [RealClearPolitics]Polling points to Trump and Clinton winning big - Mark Blumenthal: ""Trump held a significant lead throughout the week, winning the support of 36% of Republican voters who reside in 11 states holding primaries or caucuses on Tuesday….Trump also held comfortable leads in 6 of 7 states holding Republican primary elections on March 1....Trump’s leads were widest in Alabama and Tennessee, where his vote total approached half of Republicans….On the Democratic side, Hillary Clinton held wide leads over Bernie Sanders in 3 states where SurveyMonkey was able to conduct more than 500 interviews among Democratic voters over the past week. She led by margins ranging between 17 and 23 percentage points in Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia. Sanders ran far closer in Massachusetts, where Clinton had a slight edge (48 to 46%)."" [SurveyMonkey] Prediction markets agree with the polls - Andre Tartar and Ben Brody: “As of Sunday, PredictWise had Trump up in 10 of 11 states—all except Texas, where home-state Senator Ted Cruz is at 85 percent. Otherwise Trump is dominant, with his odds of winning ranging from 67 percent in Minnesota to 96 percent in Tennessee. As for Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, he's second most likely to win in every state except Alaska, Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. On the Democratic side, Clinton is expected to win 10 of 11 states, according to the PredictWise model, up from eight before her win in the South Carolina primary on Saturday. She has a greater than 95 percent chance of winning delegate-rich Texas, Georgia, and Virginia. The odds lean toward Senator Bernie Sanders in his home state of Vermont and have shifted away from him in Colorado and Massachusetts.” [Bloomberg]AMERICANS AREN’T CONVINCED OBAMA CAN CLOSE GUANTANAMO BAY - HuffPollster: ""Americans are about evenly split on whether Guantanamo Bay prisoners could safely be held in the U.S., a new HuffPost/YouGov poll finds.

Thirty-nine percent of Americans polled say prisoners could safely be held at a U.S. prison facility, while 40 percent say they couldn't be, and another 22 percent aren't sure….Public opinion, like the debate in Washington, divides along partisan lines, with 54 percent of Democrats, compared to just a quarter of Republicans, believing the U.S. has the capacity to bring some of the detainees stateside….

24,POLITICS,No One Knows Who's Behind This Senator's Re-Election Campaign,Paul Blumenthal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/richard-shelby-dark-money_us_56d4adb0e4b0bf0dab330979,Campaign ads for five-term Senator Richard Shelby have been financed with nearly $1 million in dark money.,2016-03-01,Sen. Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) is benefiting from nearly $1 million in undisclosed spending ahead of the March 1 primary election.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d4adfd1e0000950070f050.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Independent groups that don't disclose their donors have put nearly $1 million behind campaign ads for Senate banking committee chairman Richard Shelby, who faces upstart conservative John McConnell and three other challengers in Alabama.Citizens for a Sound Government, a Colorado-based social welfare nonprofit, is the lead group backing Shelby. The conservative group has spent more than $400,000 on its own to fund ads for Shelby and contributed another $400,000 to fund Citizen Super PAC's pro-Shelby ads. In addition, One Nation, a nonprofit connected to a former aide of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, has spent $140,000 on radio ads to support the five-term senator.Since the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision opened the door to unlimited corporate, union and individual spending on elections, the amount of untraceable money supporting political campaigns has soared. While super PACs must disclose their donors, nonprofits like Citizens for a Sound Government do not. Usually, they direct this undisclosed dark money toward the most competitive races -- but, as Shelby’s campaign shows, unknown donors are supporting even relatively safe incumbents.“The problem with dead-end disclosure situations is we have no idea who is behind it and no way to find out,” said Jordan Libowitz, communications director for the campaign finance watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington.It's not clear who's funding the pro-Shelby ads, but tax forms show that Citizens for a Sound Government is connected to Republican party insiders working to influence government policy. Citizens for a Sound Government was created in 2011 by Gentry Collins, James Anderson and Alan Philp, founders of the “grassroots” lobbying firm CAP Public Affairs. All three are also former Republican National Committee staffers. CAP Public Affairs helps its clients promote topics they care about by encouraging ordinary citizens to reach out to lawmakers about them. This practice of manufacturing grassroots support for an issue is also known as ""astroturfing,"" and it's not mandatory to disclose the groups behind it. CAP Public Affairs' only publicly disclosed client is the government of Angola, which the firm worked for in 2012.In 2014, Citizens for a Sound Government paid CAP Public Affairs -- in other words, its own founders -- nearly $500,000 to cover project management fees.Philp is still the president of Citizens for a Sound Government, but in 2013, Jeff Burton and Reeves Barbour replaced Collins and Anderson as board members. Barbour is a lobbyist for Crest Investment Company, a private equity firm with global energy holdings. He's also the son of Haley Barbour, the former Mississippi governor and super-lobbyist.Burton runs a political consulting firm called Prevail Strategies. In 2014, Burton’s Prevail Strategies received nearly $150,000 from the Independent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America trade group to support Republican candidates in the midterm elections.Citizens for a Sound Government has also been active in past elections. In 2014, the nonprofit group spent $1.3 million on “research” and “education” related to the Nebraska gubernatorial campaign. Some of this money went toward so-called ""issue ads"" promoting Republican Pete Ricketts’ successful gubernatorial race and attacking his primary campaign opponent, Jon Bruning. The group also funneled $685,000 to a super PAC supporting Connecticut Republican gubernatorial candidate Tom Foley, who lost that election.Just last year, Citizens for a Sound Government spent more than $200,000 on TV ads to support Kentucky gubernatorial candidate Hal Heiner, a Republican, and gave $200,000 to a super PAC supporting him. Heiner lost the Republican primary race to Matt Bevin.Citizen Super PAC, which received $400,000 from Citizens for a Sound Government, is a for-hire group with no clear objective except to provide a super PAC shell for donors to fund ads without their names on them. Established as a crowd-sourced super PAC to fund election ads -- along the lines of Kickstarter or GoFundMe -- the group features three pro-Shelby projects on its website that have all been fully funded.Due to the mercenary nature of Citizen Super PAC, it’s unclear whether its other donors are funding ads to support Shelby or other candidates. A super PAC called New Generation PAC donated nearly $130,000 to Citizen Super PAC on Jan. 20 before closing up shop. New Generation had received $100,000 from the coal company Murray Energy Corporation and a couple of five-figure donations from California-based Ramat Medical and S&F Management Company.All of this spending to support Shelby shows just how hard it is to determine who is helping to elect powerful politicians.Citizens for a Sound Government did not respond to a request for comment."

NASCAR's CEO and four other drivers endorsed Trump on Monday.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d4da261e0000220070f0a5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In July, NASCAR decided not to return its annual postseason awards banquet to a Donald Trump-owned resort in Miami after the business mogul called Mexican immigrants ""rapists"" and ""criminals"" in the speech that launched his presidential campaign.But Monday night, the stock car racing organization's CEO, Brian France, appeared on stage at a Trump campaign rally in Valdosta, Georgia, to endorse the Republican front-runner. Three current NASCAR drivers -- Ryan Newman, David Ragan and Chase Elliott -- and retired driver Bill Elliott joined France in endorsing Trump.A NASCAR spokesman maintained in July that the organization was not taking a position on Trump's comments, but instead made the decision to move its event based on ""what we heard from our sponsors and our partners and what we feel we should be doing."" Camping World, the sponsor of NASCAR's truck series, had reportedly urged the organization to relocate the awards banquet.France made his personal position clear Monday.""Mr. Trump is changing American politics forever and his leadership and strength are desperately needed,"" France said in a statement released by the Trump campaign. ""He has had an incredible career and achieved tremendous success. This is what we need for our country.""In the summer, Trump slammed NASCAR and ESPN, which also moved events away from Trump resorts after his comments, for their decisions.But he hailed the endorsements of France and the other drivers on Monday, saying he was ""proud to receive the endorsement of such an iconic brand.""Trump has not backed off his racist and xenophobic comments about Mexicans and other groups since an assortment of sports leagues and organizations -- including NASCAR, the PGA Tour, ESPN and NBC -- broke ties with him or moved events last summer. If anything, he's gone even further: In December, he called for banning Muslim immigrants from entering the country.On Sunday, Trump refused to denounce white supremacist groups and David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader who has supported Trump's campaign, during an appearance on CNN, though Trump later said he had spoken out against Duke at an earlier press conference.Editor's Note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

The lights came back on after about five minutes.""I don't remember the light ever going off,"" said Lyle Denniston, a veteran reporter for SCOTUSblog who has covered the Supreme Court for 58 years -- longer than Kagan has been alive.Flummoxed by the incident, an unidentified reporter in the court's press office was overheard saying, ""Scalia still finds a way to shut them down.""There have been other malfunctions during open court in the past -- including a clock going nuts in November and an exploding lightbulb shortly after Roberts started on the job in 2005.""It's a trick they play on new chief justices all the time,"" he said at the time, also to an uproar from attendees. ""We're even more in the dark now than before.""This is the second strange thing that happened at the court this week. On Monday, Justice Clarence Thomas asked an astonishing 10 questions from the bench for the first time in a decade -- perhaps one question for each year of silence.With a major abortion case slated for arguments on Wednesday, there's no telling what other historic moments await the high court."

Chris Christie to resign in a searing editorial published Tuesday, expressing frustration with the former GOP presidential candidate and his newfound allegiance for GOP frontrunner Donald Trump.Local papers the Asbury Park Press, Home News Tribune, Courier News, Cherry Hill Courier-Post, Daily Journal and Morristown Daily Record said Christie should step down after ""his long neglect of the state to pursue his own selfish agenda.""""We’re disgusted with his endorsement of Donald Trump after he spent months on the campaign trail trashing him,"" the editorial reads. ""And we’re fed up with his continuing travel out of state on New Jersey’s dime, stumping for Trump.""The piece goes on to note that Christie spent 261 full or partial days out of the state last year alone. It questions his recent pledge to Trump and lambasts his lack of correspondence with the media since he suspended his presidential campaign. The editorial also calls on citizens to initiate a recall should their governor refuse to leave his post.""For the good of the state, it’s time for Christie to do his long-neglected constituents a favor and resign as governor,"" it reads. ""New Jersey needs someone whose full attention is devoted to making life better for New Jersey’s citizens.""The news comes just a few short weeks after the Trump endorsement, which could indicate Christie is vying for vice presidential consideration under the business magnate. But the allegiance has been met with harsh backlash from GOP leadership, who say the governor has tarnished his own brand.But that brand may already be facing some serious tests, as Christie's popularity in his home state has waned in recent months. A poll released in January found just 31 percent of New Jersey voters had a favorable opinion of their governor, while 59 percent said they disapproved of his administration.Christie's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Also on HuffPost:"
