0,WELLNESS,The 6 Things That Helped Me Get to the Finish Line of the Chicago Marathon,"Ana Beatriz Cholo, Contributor
Mom, award-winning journalist, adventurer, Navy vet, Latino Ou...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marathon-tips_us_5b9da8c4e4b03a1dcc8af7ae,"I would reach that finish line, even if I had to crawl, which is why I sought the help of professionals, like the podiatrist and a good physical therapist who preached that you don't run to train, you train to run.",2013-11-14,"Runners participate in the Chicago Marathon in Chicago, Sunday, Oct. 13, 2013. (AP Photo/Nam Y. Huh)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9da8c42000002d00fe0c9e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When I set out on a run at the Lake Hollywood Reservoir Sunday, my first since participating in the Chicago Marathon a month earlier, I was eager. My mp3 player was dead so I figured I would just listen to Pandora on my iPhone. But when I realized there was no reception in the area, and I would not be able to listen to music, I almost quit -- like a big crybaby.I have a good reason, though, for my histrionic behavior. When I run I need motivation to keep me going because, several miles in, my right knee starts throbbing, then my left, followed by the ugly bunions on my feet. TMI much? Then there's my iliotibial band issue, a common injury which often affects the outside of the knee all the way to the gluteal region, i.e., the buttocks. Music distracts me, and that's key for me -- anything to keep me from thinking of the pain. A month before the marathon, my podiatrist inserted expensive, non-insurance-covered orthotics into my running shoes to address my foot deformity. He promised they would help prevent the blood blisters I had been getting, but my anxiety was not assuaged. With all my injured body parts, my overactive imagination went into overdrive and I envisioned lunging for my medal at the finish and then collapsing into a heap. I needed to graduate to long-distance runs, but I could not get seem to get past running more than half marathon distance -- a mere 13.1 miles. My boyfriend, who was also running the marathon with me, kept telling me it was time to start tapering, in other words, slowing it all down, but I brushed him off. How could I taper if I still needed to train? With his close-to-perfect, German engineered body parts, he had never experienced this kind of discomfort while running. What did he know? It irked me when he kept telling me that he was confident I would finish. How annoying to have to deal with someone who believes in you so much. I tried for 17 or 18 miles, but I only made it to 14. That was the longest I would run before the marathon. Don't worry, marathon vets assured me. You can probably walk the entire thing and still make it within the six and a half hour cutoff. What? I screamed inside: But, I don't want to walk a marathon! I want to run like the wind. I wanted to resemble those strong, athletic, long-legged women featured in Nike ads with the breeze blowing through their hair whilst carrying that air of invincibility. Despite my doubts, I knew it wasn't in me to give up and that was cause for worry -- that I might push too much and injure myself even more. Not only do I have a high threshold for pain, but I've long suspected I'm a closet masochist. I would reach that finish line, even if I had to crawl, which is why I sought the help of professionals, like the podiatrist and a good physical therapist who preached that you don't run to train, you train to run. Work on strengthening the glutes, my PT recommended, so less pressure is placed on the aging knees. Squats, side-lying hip abductions, monster and crab walks, and clam exercises all became my frenemies. Ultimately, it was strength training, along with these six things, that I believe helped get me to the end. 1. Chicago. I mean, it's an amazing city. I lived here for five years when I worked as an education reporter for the Chicago Tribune covering the city's schools as my beat. I had to move back home before my sixth winter, however, because this wimpy California girl simply not withstand that kind of cold. Besides, I was becoming alarmingly obese due to my relative lack of activity and exercise. Who wants to go outside when it's freezing? So on that marathon Sunday a little over a month ago, I ran through old haunts in 29 diverse neighborhoods and thoroughly enjoyed it. From the Loop in downtown to Pilsen, where I stopped to take a photo with my iPhone of Nuevo Leon, my favorite Mexican restaurant in the entire world, all the way to the end at Grant Park and Buckingham Fountain. 2. The perfect weather. It was a sunny high of 65 degrees. Hey, you never know what to expect with the Windy City. It's entirely plausible that the marathon could have taken place during a blizzard and I would have had to don a parka. In years prior, the marathon has been marked by freezing rain, heat and humidity, below freezing wind chills, snow and death. Yes, people have died running this thing. I tried really hard not to dwell on that sad fact. 3. The cheering masses. You would not expect to find that kind of support in LA. Who wants to stand on a street corner cheering when you can be at the beach or on an obnoxious, double-decker bus tour gaping at movie star homes? Thankfully, Chicagoans come out in droves for the marathon with incredibly clever signs. I especially liked one that said ""I don't know you, but I'm proud of you."" At mile 23, I laughed aloud at the one that said: ""Consider the first 23 miles a warm-up. The 5K fun run starts now."" And that is exactly how I looked at it. I was able to smell the end, at that point.4. Sentimentality and nostalgia. What do I know -- this was my very first marathon, but I think it must help when you have a real connection to the city you're running in. I mean, my first day at work here was Sept. 11, 2001. My kids spent their formative years here -- attending a public school in the city, cheering for the Cubbies and getting to know all of the city's wonderful museums and cultural landmarks. In fact, when I moved back home to LA, I retained my Chi Town cell phone number. I'm still reppin' the 312, baby.5. Drugs (Advil). I popped one in early in the race and then at mile 16. I have no proof that it helped alleviate the pain from my aforementioned body parts, but I don't think it made them any worse. 6. Music. This one is probably the most important to me. For some reason, I must have played Mary J. Blige's ""Family Affair"" at least five times. ""Knights of Cydonia"" from Muse got me through miles 20 to 23. Additional shout-outs to Garbage, No Doubt, Shakira, Enimen, Rihanna, AC/DC, Guns n' Roses and Garth Brooks. I know, my tastes are a bit on the eclectic side. They were all there for me. By mile 14, only halfway done, I was confident, and even quasi cocky, that I would make it to the finish line. When I got to 20, I was like, ""I got this. It's a 10K now."" It really was all a mind game to me. At mile 25 I saw my boyfriend on the sidelines patiently waiting. He had finished two hours earlier and had the coveted medal in his possession. I was tempted to yank it off his neck, but thankfully, I maintained my composure and restrained myself.I wanted that medal but figured I should earn it.And although I wasn't running fast, I was steady and took very short walk breaks. It took me five hours and 51 minutes to finish with a 13:30 minute per mile pace. The ""problem"" with accomplishing something as big as a marathon is that it makes you believe you're capable of doing another one, which is why just days after I finished the race I signed up for the LA Marathon in March. I haven't told my bunions, knees or hips about the race yet. With this particular race I will have an added motivation to finish this one -- raising money for iPads that will be used in my autistic son's public school kindergarten classroom. If you want to join me, read more.And I'm open to most music suggestions. Well, except for jazz and speed metal."
1,FOOD & DRINK,The NYC Craft Beer Festival Winter Harvest,"Caitlin Colford, Contributor

The brewery calls hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, used to free natural gas from shale, a 'material threat' to its business.

The festival will feature three sessions over two days on Saturday, November 23rd and Sunday, November 24th. With a 15 percent growth spurt from 2012, the craft beer industry is vaster and more extensive than ever. Given the larger industry and higher demand, brewers are allotted room for creativity, and therefore are mastering the art of inventive beers for every occasion. To show for it, the NYC Craft Beer Festival will feature the winter releases from 75 of America's top craft breweries. Aside from general admission tickets for the NYC Craft Beer Festival, which cost $55 each, beer lovers can choose to purchase a VIP pass -- allowing and advance hour of tasting -- or a connoisseur package that include the additional hour as well as access to a connoisseur lounge for rare beer tastings.After touring New York breweries as research for their forthcoming book Beer Lover's New York: The Empire State's Best Breweries, Brewpubs and Bars, beer aficionados Sarah and Giancarlo Annese decided to hone in on New York local beers when curating the NYC Craft Beer Festival. I spoke to the married couple for a closer look inside the current state of craft brewing.Imperial IPAs, a high alcohol strong ale, were once the fad amongst craft beer lovers, but over the summer there was an onset of session beers that saturated the market, for example the newly popular Founders All Day IPA that has a low ABV of 4.70 percent. What do you equate this new trend to? Giancarlo: When someone first discovers craft beer -- ourselves included -- they want to investigate and taste the most different, most interesting beers out there. Until quite recently, those beers have been fairly high in alcohol, because the lower alcohol beers really didn't taste that great. When you start out the night with a 10 percent beer, it's probably not the best idea to drink too many more. Sarah: We've been really excited about the lower alcohol, ""sessionable"" beer trend, because innovative craft brewers have started to shift their focus to brewing flavorful beers with low alcohol. It's really great to be able to enjoy an hours-long drinking session and still be able to carry on a coherent conversation. In 2012 there were 2,403 breweries, the highest number since the 1880s, providing an estimated 103,585 jobs for Americans (American Brewers Association). Is it only upward from here on out? S: In the craft beer industry, as is common in any industry that's trendy and exciting, there are breweries opening that are really awesome but then there are others that aren't so great. We think as the industry continues to grow, breweries that are creative and focused on quality will continue to thrive but those that don't keep up with the rest will struggle. G: The more players there are, the more interesting and unique a brewery will have to be to get noticed in the industry. How else has the craft beer industry positively impacted the economy? S: We've seen so many breweries open up in and help to revitalize neighborhoods, towns or cities that were struggling. A really great example of this is Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The Brooklyn Brewery has consistently supported the growth of the neighborhood, when it opened up, Williamsburg was pretty much dead. G: The number of breweries in the country has exploded even through the long recession. Craft beer has such a great impact on the local economy, it's a local product, it provides neighborhood jobs, and it's such a great way to put money back into the community.  Limited run brews are also quite popular this year, including Stone's ""Enjoy By"" or even Dogfish Head's ""Firefly Ale,"" brewed specifically for the Firefly Music Festival. And those are only two examples out of many. What allows brewers to make such small batches? G: Experimentation has been one of the hallmarks of craft beer. The process of brewing small, limited batches allows brewers to explore new ideas and experiment with new techniques. This creativity pushes them to make more interesting and flavorful beers. Some of these beers eventually make it into the regular line up for breweries. Limited releases also help generate interest in breweries and increase interactions between brewers and beer enthusiasts at events.  In 2012 over 13,00,000 barrels of craft beer was sold domestically versus over 11,000,000 barrels of craft beer sold in 2011. What is making America fall in love with craft beer? S: Sometimes there's no better way to spend an afternoon or an evening than having conversations with friends over food and libations. Enthusiasm for craft beers has mirrored the increased focus on quality food; drinkers can find flavorful beers brewed close to home instead of mass produced beers that don't focus on quality. We also think the explosion of craft beer has a lot to do with people really wanting to support their local economies. Wanting to promote independent, passionate business owners and small businesses.  What are among your favorite beers of 2013? S: 2013 was a really exciting year for us and beer because we had the opportunity to travel around New York State working on a book and tasting all the exciting beers New York has to offer, so really our favorite beers of 2013 are from small New York brewers. We'd have to put C.A.F.E sour from Newburgh brewing Company on the list, Simple Sour from Peekskill Brewery, Naysayer Pale Ale from Rushing Duck Brewing Company (all in the Hudson Valley), Peacock golden oat ale from Birdland Brewing Company in Horseheads, and The Whale from Community Beer Works in Buffalo. G: New York State has so many experimental and exciting brewers, which is why when designing the list for the upcoming New York City Craft Beer Festival we tried to focus as much as we could on New York beers. You will have the opportunity to taste Ommegang's Take the Black stout, which is a collaboration ""Game of Thrones"" beer series with HBO. Sixpoint Global Warmer will be on hand to taste, you'll get beers from the Bronx Brewery, Southern Tier and Blue Point.    What are a few exciting things brewin' within the craft beer industry for 2014? S: What we are most excited to see is incredible growth the country is going through in terms of craft beer. Breweries in New York City alone are expected to double by next year. So we're excited to see more and more people following their passion and making delicious beers. G: As breweries take advantage of the new Farm Brewery license in New York we are excited to see what they can do with local hops and grain. We've already seen them turn to local hop farmers to brew wet hopped beers but there is potential for even more collaboration. We had the opportunity to try some great beers from Good Nature Brewing out of Hamilton New York where the focus is on creating a strong connection between local farms, brewers, and drinkers. More breweries like this can help distinguish New York as a beer destination.  Are there any new beers on the horizon you are looking forward to? S: We're down to try any beer that you put in front of us! G: We also look forward to seeing more session beers and sour or wild fermented brews. We are always impressed with beers from Crooked Stave, Founders, Greenport Harbor, and Barrier to name a few.  What state do you feel is ""the one to look out for"" within the craft beer industry in the U.S.?   S: There's no way we can't be biased when answering this question -- we think New York! Usually, when someone is asked to name a great beer state, they'll mention Oregon, California, Colorado, or North Carolina. New York often gets overlooked. But there are some amazing things going on here and there is a lot of room to grow. G: Hudson Valley brewers in particular like Jeff O'Neill of Peekskill and Chris Basso of Newburgh are setting a standard for the state's brewing community and the agriculture is just starting to supply brewers with hops and grain. There are a lot of creative people who are experimenting with ingredients and styles to produce great beers.

I'd heard about this fizzy, fermented tea of sorts. I'd heard it might serve to settle your guts after you'd possibly abused them by eating too many cheeseburgers and drinking too many Manhattans. I'd heard it had probiotics, which sounded like it made sense -- isn't that what the queen of healthy guts, Jamie Lee Curtis is always talking about? I'd also heard that it tasted really weird, which is ordinarily something I'm keen decide for myself. But for some reason, whether it's the bottles it is usually packaged in or the hefty price tag, I still expected that it was going to taste vaguely like juice. For those of you who are not already laughing at me, kombucha does not taste like juice. Let me repeat that, just in case you are about to take your first sip: kombucha does not taste like juice. Kombucha tastes like what it is -- fermented tea. In case you are having an understandably difficult time guessing what fermented tea tastes like, I have another descriptive flavor word for you: vinegary. Those who know me will report with absolute certainty that I really like vinegar. I really like kimchi. I really like beer. Fermented foods and I are bros. Which is why, when I opened my first bottle of kombucha, took a big gulp, widened my eyes into saucers and spit it immediately into a nearby garbage can, my husband was very surprised. ""It's vinegar soda!"" I shouted (I did, actually, shout that -- apologies to the other people on the train platform that day). I tried to choke down a few more sips, but ultimately resigned myself to failure and threw the bottle away. Over the next few weeks, I acted truly grumpy about this maybe-health-food-but-maybe-not that everyone else seemed obsessed with. I made barfing noises when someone mentioned it. I really, really wanted to hate it. But. Slowly, surely, after one too many cheeseburgers or Manhattans, kombucha started staring at me in bodegas. It was looking right through me, daring me to give it another shot. I am rarely content to not like something after only trying it once, and I knew it had to be done. One day, on my lunch break, without friends or co-workers, I slipped into a deli I don't normally go to, like I was trying to cover my tracks or something. I bought a kombucha, dealt with the fact that it costs as much as a pint of beer in a bar, and gave it another shot. It IS vinegar soda, but guess what -- I like vinegar and I like soda. Does it repair my gut health after abuse? I have no idea. But it does serve to settle my stomach, and at least for a little while provide me with the satisfaction of doing something good for myself. Even if that is an illusion, it usually helps me think more clearly, motivate to do other good things for myself and also get ready to eat another cheeseburger and drink another Manhattan.Oops, I accidentally love kombucha.Want to read more from HuffPost Taste?

5,FOOD & DRINK,Cooking Off the Cuff: A Brighter Lamb Stew With a Versatile Sauce,"Edward Schneider, Contributor
Travel, cooking and food writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cooking-off-the-cuff-a-brighter-lamb-stew_us_5b9da86be4b03a1dcc8af380,"Lamb stew: Typically rich and dark, starting with deeply browned meat; maybe with tomatoes, maybe with olives, always slick with olive oil.",2013-11-13,"Lamb neck from 3-Corner Field Farm seasoned with salt, pepper and fennel seed",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9da8692500003300368c12.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Lamb stew: Typically rich and dark, starting with deeply browned meat; maybe with tomatoes, maybe with olives, always slick with olive oil. Jackie and I never get tired of it. But that doesn't mean we're not open to new options.At the farmers' market the other week, I found myself buying pale-colored things, such as leeks, fennel, celery root (celeriac) and tart green tomatoes destined never to ripen. Also, at the 3-Corner Field Farm stand, there were thick slices of lamb neck, one of the great braising cuts, in many ways better than its neighbor the shoulder or the ever-popular shank (either of which you can use for today's dish).Before that market run I'd been thinking of a lamb goulash, but once I got the meat home, its delicacy drew me to the conclusion that it would be overwhelmed by all those dark-brown lard-cooked onions and all that paprika. That's where the pale ingredients came in: I decided a lighter, more acidic accompaniment would give the lamb a fairer shake. Once I'd figured the dish out, I made it twice within a week, the second time in a slightly simpler version that yielded a sauce/accompaniment of amazing versatility, so that's the version I'll describe.First of all, as soon as I got home from the market, I used some of the tops of the leeks, fennel and celeriac, along with a carrot, a few sage and parsley leaves and some fennel seed, to make a quick pressure-cooker vegetable stock that would echo the flavors planned for the lamb. Then (this was the day before dinner), in a casserole, I lightly -- lightly -- browned the four slices of lamb neck (one per person), which I'd seasoned with salt, pepper and whole fennel seed. I removed the lamb to a plate and added to the casserole chopped leek, fennel tops, celery (regular stalk celery), sage, parsley and lemon zest. When the aromatics had wilted, I added a cup of white verjuice - just because I had some: 2/3 cup of white wine would have done the job -- then returned the meat to the casserole. I added vegetable stock to not-quite cover the meat, set a shred of lemon zest on each piece of lamb, and brought the liquid to the simmer, at which point I checked for seasoning. The casserole, with the lid ajar by just a crack and the meat covered with a circle of parchment paper, went into an oven preheated to 325 degrees F. After an hour I turned the meat; after another 45 minutes it was tender. Start checking after a total of 75 minutes: shoulder or neck may just be done by then -- or it could take much longer, depending on the lamb.I removed the meat to cool and strained the sauce into a bowl, pressing to extract maximal goodness from the vegetables. When everything had reached room temperature, I wrapped up the lamb and refrigerated it; the sauce too went into the fridge.When dinner time approached, I prepared the vegetables that would appear in the final dish: I cut celery root, leeks and fennel bulb into neat 3/8-inch dice and got them started in the clean casserole, with a little butter (olive oil would be another way to go) and another few sage leaves, slivered. I removed the fat from the sauce (it had congealed and was easy to lift off the surface) and added the sauce to the vegetables. When the vegetables were nearly tender, I added two green tomatoes cut into the same size dice and the grated zest of a medium lemon, then tasted for seasoning and -- crucially -- acidity. Of that, more was needed, so I added the juice of half a lemon. Now, I laid in the pieces of lamb to heat through, then served them with plenty of vegetables and sauce. Boiled potatoes, crushed then lightly browned in butter with mushrooms, were a good accompaniment. This didn't explicitly recall Greek/Middle Eastern lemon sauces, though it had some of their brightness, but with an undertow of earthiness from the autumn vegetables and the meat.The amount of liquid and vegetables I used guaranteed leftover sauce - quite a lot of it. That was intentional: we repurposed it. Twice, no less. The following night, we ate some of it as a vegetable soup with bread and butter, then the night after that we used the last of it - just a third of a cup per portion -- as sauce for a tiny piece of striped bass served as a first course. For that, I freshened it up with chopped fennel fronds and slivered celery-root leaves, a little more sage, and an additional squeeze of lemon juice. And no, it was not weird to serve a lamb-based sauce with the bass: meat sauces with fish are not uncommon, and this one was so vegetable-y and lemony that it made for a pretty perfect start to the meal."
