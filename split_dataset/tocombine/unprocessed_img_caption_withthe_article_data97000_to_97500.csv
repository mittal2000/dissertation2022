""Simpsons"" executive producer Al Jean set the record straight to TMZ:It would mean back in 1993 we would presume the show was going on for years and years more and right before we left, threw this hidden monkey wrench in for all our successors. In the April 1993 episode, ""So It’s Come To This: A Simpsons Clip Show,"" Homer goes into a coma after being blown up by Bart's April Fools' Day prank. The theory, proposed on Reddit by Hardtopickaname, stated that Homer never recovered and the whole show was happening in his head. Evidence included the more fantastical plots that came after the episode and the fact that all the characters remain the same age.Though the theory gained a lot of positive feedback and traction online, it has now obviously been disproven. In addition, Jean also debunked the ""Dead Bart"" theory, which claims a ""Simpsons"" episode where Bart dies was produced and locked away, saying both bits of speculation go in the ""intriguing but false file.""The good news is there are still plenty of ""Simpsons"" theories out there for everyone to get excited about. For instance, did you know every member of the Simpson family is a genius? It's true! You know, maybe ..."

Miami won 30-23. (Photo by Tom Szczerbowski/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb778a32200004301dd1271.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Richie Incognito, the NFL player fighting to repair his image and rejuvenate his career after his long history of racist and homophobic bullying became public knowledge, just wants everyone to know he’s not actually a “racist jerk” anymore. He just might find some things kind of funny that other people might think are kind of horrible. In a text message to NFL.com this week, Incognito wrote that he has learned from his past mistakes and hopes to “bring attention to a sensitive subject” (presumably bullying, racism or homphobia) next season with the Buffalo Bills, the team he agreed to sign with over the weekend.""I told [the Buffalo Bills] what I had learned from the whole situation,"" Incognito wrote in the text, ""that I needed to respect those around me more and that I needed to realize I may find things funny that other find offensive.” ""[I want to take] the opportunity to bring attention to a sensitive subject while proving to people that I'm not a racist jerk,"" he continued. ""We talked about possible ways to turn this situation around and ways we can impact the community.”The deal with the Bills is Incognito’s first since he was suspended by the Miami Dolphins in 2013 over his treatment of players and trainers. A report conducted last year by an independent investigator for the NFL found that Incognito repeatedly hurled racial slurs at one of the team’s trainers and subjected an anonymous player known as “Player A” to “homophobic name-calling.” Two telling snippets from the report: On December 7, 2012, the anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Incognito, Jerry and Pouncey donned traditional Japanese headbands that featured a rising sun emblem (which the Assistant Trainer had given them) and jokingly threatened to harm the Assistant Trainer physically in retaliation for the Pearl Harbor attack. According to Martin, the Assistant Trainer confided in him that he was upset about the Pearl Harbor comments, finding them derogatory toward his heritage. But a large portion of the report focused on the team’s starting right tackle, Jonathan Martin, who eventually left the team to receive help for “emotional issues."" Martin, in particular, was “subjected to persistent harassing language,” according to the report. If that seems vague, here’s a voicemail he was sent by Incognito: Hey, wassup, you half n----r piece of sh-t. I saw you on Twitter, you been training 10 weeks. [I want to] sh-t in your f--king mouth. [I'm going to] slap your f--king mouth. [I'm going to] slap your real mother across the face [laughter]. F--k you, you're still a rookie. I'll kill you.For now, anti-bullying advocates in Buffalo are trying to remember that people can change, but seem dubious about whether Incognito really has. ""Can people be redeemed? Should we give second chances? Absolutely, if we're talking about a kid or a first offense,"" Amanda Nickerson, director of the University at Buffalo's Alberti Center for Bullying Abuse Prevention, told The Buffalo News this week. ""[But] I'm concerned about it. If it was just Incognito's issues from 2013, that would be one thing. But there's been a history of aggressive and violent and demeaning behavior that is hard to ignore."""

This inequality threatens the entire economy's future growth and stability. But whenever someone offers a solution to this growing problem, someone else on the right is likely to accuse them of ""class war.""Class war is precisely what we've been seeing for decades now -- but it's been waged for, not against, the wealthy. And Republicans have been its dutiful servants from the start. It might make a good hashtag, come to think of it: #RepublicanClassWar.The wreckage of this war can be seen all around us. Incomes for the top 1 percent of households have more than doubled since the 1980s. The top 0.1 percent has increased its share of this nation's total wealth from 7 percent in 1978 to 22 percent in 2012, a level not seen since before the Great Depression. Ninety percent of American households saw no increase in their wealth after 1986.There's a war on -- but the middle class didn't start it.Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee opened up a new front in that war today by targeting disabled Social Security recipients. They didn't say they were conducting a class war, of course. Instead they claimed that they were concerned about the future financial stability of the Social Security disability program. They're expressing that concern in a strange way: by blocking an adjustment between trust funds that would restore it to financial health, something previous Congresses have done 11 times in the past.The Los Angeles Times' Michael Hiltzik lays out the flaws in the GOP's position. I explored some of their arguments, and the human toll their past actions have taken, earlier this year. Among their discredited ideas is the notion that the disability fund is ""going broke."" (It can pay 80 percent of benefits with no changes, and a slight rebalancing from the retirement trust fund would restore the remainder.)A 20-percent benefit cut would almost certainly be a ""death sentence"" for many disabled Americans, as Acting Social Security Commissioner Carolyn Colvin told the committee today. Broader cuts to retiree benefits -- which the Republicans have made clear is their real goal -- would be disastrous for the elderly.But what makes this assault on Social Security part of a class war?One clue can be found in a trope that was trotted out by Budget Committee Chair Mike Enzi again today. ""Don't trust a federal trust fund,"" said Enzi. ""There are no dollars in the disability trust fund, and there are no dollars in the Social Security trust fund. We spent the money."" (Note that by ""Social Security trust fund"" he presumably means the retirement trust fund.)What does he mean, exactly? The Treasury Department executes legally binding instruments, similar to government bonds, in return for the money it borrowed from these trust funds. They're as legitimate as the Treasury bonds held by Wall Street banks. If the government wants to renege on its financial commitments, it would be just as legal to start with Wall Street's bonds instead.Not that they would, of course. No Republican would ever tell a bank executive that ""we spent your money"" -- even though that executive undoubtedly benefited from policies that increased government deficits. Today's conservatives apparently have no qualms about hijacking money collected and held in trust on behalf of working Americans. Can you picture them doing that with funds owed to the rich and powerful?Then there's Enzi's telling phrase: ""We spent the money."" Who is the ""we"" in that sentence, exactly? Republicans drove the government's deficits with a trillion-dollar tax break for the wealthy and multitrillion-dollar military spending. ""We"" -- the Republicans and their patrons -- have had quite a party, and it's not over yet. Now they want the disabled and the elderly to pick up their tab -- by living lives of ever-increasing privation.A better alternative, as Sen. Bernie Sanders reminded the committee today, would be to increase contributions from high earners by ""lifting the cap"" on the payroll tax that funds Social Security. ""A Wall Street CEO who makes $20 million a year pays the same amount into Social Security as someone who makes $118,500,"" said Sanders. ""That is wrong.""""Lifting the cap"" would go a long way toward balancing the books for the next 75 years. It would also be fair. As a recent analysis from the Center for American Progress (CAP) shows, inequality contributed significantly to Social Security's projected shortfalls.CAP concludes that the trust funds would have an additional three quarters of a trillion dollars today if wage increases had kept pace with rising productivity -- as they did for our three greatest decades of postwar economic growth. But the wealthy have been keeping more of the profits for themselves, aided by deliberate policy choices.If the payroll tax cap had continued to capture 90 percent of the nation's earnings, as it was intended to do, CAP estimates that the trust funds would have an additional $1.1 trillion on hand. But rising wage inequality has left a greater share of the nation's income above the cap's cutoff point.A new analysis by Benjamin Veghte, Research Director of Social Security Works, calls for increasing Social Security benefits and notes that this could be funded not just by lifting the cap but by raising taxes on other forms of high-net-worth income and earmarking the revenues for Social Security.Veghte observes that Social Security expansion would help offset the effects of lost middle-class wealth. That's an important point. Inequality is our era's gravest economic challenge. When it comes to meeting that challenge, Social Security isn't a problem; it's part of the solution.The Republicans won't tell you that, of course. They're too busy waging class war."
3,POLITICS,Why Scott Walker's Views On Evolution Are Totally Relevant,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/scott-walker-evolution_n_6671786.html,,2015-02-12,"Scott Walker, governor of Wisconsin, speaks during the Iowa Freedom Summit in Des Moines, Iowa, U.S., on Saturday, Jan. 24, 2015. The talent show that is a presidential campaign began in earnest Saturday as more than 1,200 Republican activists, who probably will vote in Iowa's caucuses, packed into a historic Des Moines theater to see and hear from a parade of their party's prospective entries. Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8e8762200005700dd8150.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Scott Walker doesn’t want reporters to ask him about his position on evolution. That’s one more reason why they should.Walker, the newly re-elected governor of Wisconsin, is a front-runner for the 2016 Republican nomination. This week he was in London to promote his state’s business interests and, undoubtedly, to establish himself as a credible figure on the world stage. But then a reporter asked Walker whether he believed in evolution. Walker said he would “punt” on that question and added “that’s a question a politician shouldn’t be involved in one way or the other.” Later, he took to Twitter:Supporters and other conservatives rallied to Walker’s defense, suggesting that the question itself was out of bounds -- or at least another example of the mainstream media ganging up on Republican candidates. But there’s a reason reporters are curious to learn what Walker thinks about evolution. Some 90 years after the Scopes Trial, the theory of evolution and its place in the schools remain matters of public debate. Two states, Louisiana and Tennessee, now allow public schools to teach “alternatives” to evolution. Several others allow public funding to support such teaching through charter schools or vouchers. At least for the sake of politics, the issue isn't really whether “faith & science are compatible,” as Scott put it; Pope Francis has said he believes in evolution, for example. Rather, the issue is whether discussions of divine intervention belong in the classroom. That raises fundamental questions about the boundaries between religion and science that Walker, as a president appointing federal judges, would have to consider.Basic respect for, and appreciation of, science is another issue. Put a bunch of evolutionary biologists in a room and you'll get a lively debate over the precise origins of some species, such as the bat, and the extent to which ""random processes,"" rather than the familiar power of natural selection, shaped populations over time. What you won’t get is denial or skepticism of the insights we now associate with Darwin -- the idea that the species on Earth emerged over a very long time, through a process of hereditary, generation-to-generation change. The science on this is just not up for reasonable debate. ""You have to be blinkered or ignorant not to know that,"" says Jerry Coyne, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Chicago and author of the book Why Evolution Is True.Interrogating Democrats about whether they accept the expert consensus on evolution, or any other scientific issue, is absolutely fair game. But Republicans have given the press, and the public, more reason to ask questions. Walker's silence turns out to be typical of the GOP presidential field, as Salon's Luke Brinker noted this week. And Republicans have shown similar disregard for science on other issues -- most critically, climate change. As with evolution, you can get a spirited, meaningful debate among the experts over precisely how quickly global warming will take place or exactly what consequences it will have. What you won’t find is a significant number of scientists questioning that the planet is warming because of human activity. And yet Republicans routinely deny this, citing supposed uncertainty over the details as reason not to take action on reducing emissions or pursuing alternative energy more aggressively.It’s possible that Walker believes in evolution and is simply wary of offending voters -- particularly the white evangelical voters who hold enormous sway in the Republican primaries and are more likely than other groups to question the theory’s basic tenets. Walker’s carefully worded tweets, which manage to talk about science without using the word “evolution,” would be consistent with such caution. Of course, this would only render the question more relevant. As president, Walker would surely have those same voters in mind when contemplating decisions about other issues -- reproductive rights, for instance, or same-sex marriage.Jon Huntsman proclaimed his belief in evolution when he sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2012. So did Mitt Romney, whose support among white evangelicals was notoriously weak. Is Walker less willing to take stands that might not play with this group, whether out of political expediency or philosophical affinity? The question certainly seems worth asking."

But Smith's return as leading man is set for the end of the month in ""Focus,"" followed by many other films, including ""Concussion,"" ""Suicide Squad"" and, eventually, ""Bad Boys 3."" Sitting down with Esquire, courtside at a 76ers and Grizzlies basketball game, Smith discussed a wide variety of subjects, including the topic of Ferguson and race in America.The change that has to happen is about to be so brutal and so painful. It’s not unlike the sixties. I think there’s actually a deeper issue at play that America is going to have to face. What we’re really talking about in this issue is people walking around the street with guns that can make a decision whether or not they’re going to kill someone, right? And that’s even more difficult, because there’s really no way back from that. This is a gun culture. And it’s painful for me, because I cannot figure out how to be helpful. I’ve always been telling my sons, We have to separate fault from responsibility—whose fault it is that black men are in this situation, whose fault it is doesn’t matter. It’s our responsibility to make it go right. It’s our responsibility. It’s a lot of people’s fault, systemic racism, and it’s a lot of people’s fault that the black community is in the situation that we’re in, but it’s our responsibility to clean up the mess.Smith also opened up about 2013's ""After Earth,"" which co-stars his son, Jaden (who, according to Smith, owns just five shirts, three pairs of pants and one pair of shoes). The film was a flop domestically, earning only $60 million, and garnering three Razzies. While Smith considers ""After Earth"" his greatest failure, he went into detail about the devastating news that soon followed that brought about a great revelation in his life:""Wild Wild West"" was less painful than ""After Earth"" because my son was involved in ""After Earth"" and I led him into it. That was excruciating. What I learned from that failure is how you win. I got reinvigorated after the failure of ""After Earth."" I stopped working for a year and a half. I had to dive into why it was so important for me to have number-one movies. And I never would have looked at myself in that way. I was a guy who, when I was fifteen my girlfriend cheated on me, and I decided that if I was number one, no woman would ever cheat on me. All I have to do is make sure that no one's ever better than me and I'll have the love that my heart yearns for. And I never released that and moved into a mature way of looking at the world and my artistry and love until the failure of ""After Earth,"" when I had to accept that it's not a good source of creation.  ""After Earth"" comes out, I get the box-office numbers on Monday and I was devastated for about twenty-four minutes, and then my phone rang and I found out my father had cancer. That put it in perspective -- viciously. And I went right downstairs and got on the treadmill. And I was on the treadmill for about ninety minutes. And that Monday started the new phase of my life, a new concept: Only love is going to fill that hole. You can’t win enough, you can’t have enough money, you can’t succeed enough. There is not enough. The only thing that will ever satiate that existential thirst is love. And I just remember that day I made the shift from wanting to be a winner to wanting to have the most powerful, deep, and beautiful relationships I could possibly have.For the whole interview, head to Esquire."

Deah Shaddy Barakat, Yusor Mohammad Abu Salha and Razan Mohammad Salha were community-minded, warm, loving and loved. It was clear that they touched many, many lives and were dedicated to service - to making meaningful sacrifices in order to improve the lives of the less fortunate. In death, we tend to air brush the blemishes and highlight further the most attractive features of the souls of the departed. Certainly, Deah, Yusor and Razan had their moments of frustration, irritation -- when they were less than their best selves. Were that not the case, they wouldn't have been human. But the breadth and heartfelt depth of the testimonials made clear that they were, indeed, uncommon in life.That they were such good people is a blessing to all whose lives they touched. That, in a sense, they had to be so good speaks to a deep, pervasive problem about how Muslims are judged in America and in other societies in which they are a minority. Like other non-dominant ethnic groups, Muslims face an inescapable and insidious representation problem: that the actions of one of their number won't simply reflect the character of the individual in question. Instead, those actions will be seen as confirming or disconfirming evidence about the group more broadly. In this regard, minorities always carry an additional burden in their private and public lives - they are really never *just* themselves. Instead they are exemplars, for good or bad, of a larger social entity.A particular privilege of being a ""normative person"" in a culture -- part of the dominant group -- is the freedom not to carry the weight and expectations of all those others with whom you are instinctively associated. Non-normative individuals in America, whether Blacks, Latinos or Muslims have no such luxury. If they don't lead exemplary lives, the consequences of their perhaps less-than-stellar conduct is likely to have cascading effects for those who look, or dress or sound like them.Muslims face their own distinctive form of the representation problem. Widely viewed as professing a faith that too readily gives license to ""terrorism,"" each heinous act carried out in the name of Allah -- however warped the interpretation necessary to justify those acts - requires a kind of public penance from *all* Muslims. That in order to be regarded as safe, credible, accepted and acceptable members of the human family, Muslims are called upon to denounce the actions of an infinitesimal number of killers, just as crimes committed by some black men are deemed evidence of a larger pathology to which all black men -- unless they demonstrate otherwise -- are prone. They are, in other words, guilty until proven innocent.Marking, celebrating and memorializing the beautiful lives of Deah, Yuzor and Razan is, in addition to whatever comfort and solace it can bring the aggrieved, an opportunity for all of us who didn't know them to reflect on how we ourselves might be better people. But there's additional work to be done to avoid falling into the trap of representation. Were they not the magnanimous, generous, selfless people they were, the three young people shot dead in Chapel Hill two days ago would have been no more deserving of their awful fate and the killer's actions would have been no more justified. In sum, Muslims are no less entitled to be ordinary than anyone else, no less entitled to be something other than martyrs to salve the prejudices of the rest of us."

Gerry Connolly (D-Va.). Perkins lost the race to Connolly by 25 percentage points.Harber is the first person convicted of illegal coordination between a political campaign and a super PAC. Super PACs are registered political committees that can raise unlimited sums of money from corporations, unions or individuals so long as they do not coordinate the content or conduct of their spending with political campaigns or parties they aim to support. These groups were created after the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision and a subsequent lower court ruling based on that Citizens United ruling.“Today, Mr. Harber took responsibility for violating federal election campaign laws by illegally coordinating payments between a super PAC and a candidate’s campaign committee,” Andrew G. McCabe, assistant director in charge of the FBI’s Washington field office, said in a statement. “The FBI will continue to investigate allegations of campaign finance abuse which are in place to ensure openness and fairness in our elections so the people’s interests are protected.”U.S. District Judge Liam O'Grady in Alexandria, Virginia, scheduled sentencing for June 5. Harber worked as campaign manager and general political consultant for the Perkins campaign in the 2012 election, according to court documents. At the same time, he helped form and operate the National Republican Victory Fund. This super PAC spent $325,000 attacking Connolly and an additional $130,000 on three unrelated campaigns.Harber admitted hiding his connection to the super PAC by using a false name when questioned about it. Then he lied to investigators looking into the case, according to the documents. His lawyer declined to comment after the court hearing.Campaign finance reform advocate Fred Wertheimer hailed the prosecution as an ""extremely important development,"" as super PACs have proliferated with seemingly little enforcement and oversight of laws against coordination.""With today’s groundbreaking criminal prosecution, the Justice Department has sent a clear and compelling warning that presidential and congressional candidates who engage in illegal coordination activities are no longer risk free and can face criminal prosecution for their campaign finance violations,"" Wertheimer said in a statement.Harber was most recently employed at the Republican consulting firm Harden Global. He was working at Harcom Strategies International at the time of his admitted crime. While all of Harber's social media profiles have been taken down, a profile of him for the Leadership Institute details his 12-year career as a political consultant and polling expert. He was named a ""rising star"" by Campaigns & Elections magazine in 2010 and one of the top 500 political influencers in 2012. The profile says Harber helped train hundreds of political operatives at the Republican National Committee and the Leadership Institute.UPDATE: 10:06 p.m. -- The Department of Justice released a statement of facts in Harber's case, detailing how Harber directed payments from the National Republican Victory Fund to a fake company under the control of his mother. This false company then paid $20,000 to Harber's mother and $118,000 to Harber. Campaigns & Elections magazine rescinded Harber's ""rising star"" designation.Ryan J. Reilly contributed reporting."

John Kitzhaber (D) said on Thursday that she was a little bit confused about why exactly Kitzhaber asked her to cut a trip short and immediately fly back to Oregon for a private meeting amid rumors that the governor was on the verge  of stepping down. Kitzhaber is currently under criminal investigation.Kitzhaber reportedly was on the verge of announcing that he would step down yesterday, but changed his mind and announced that he would remain in office. That announcement came after Kitzhaber asked Secretary of State Kate Brown (D) -- the next in line to become governor -- to return to Oregon immediately from Washington so that he could meet with her privately.Upon returning to the state, Brown immediately went to meet with Kitzhaber. Then things got weird.""I got on a plane yesterday morning and arrived at 3:40 in the afternoon. I was escorted directly into a meeting with the Governor. It was a brief meeting. He asked me why I came back early from Washington, DC, which I found strange,"" Brown said in a statement. ""I asked him what he wanted to talk about. The Governor told me he was not resigning, after which he began a conversation about transition.""Brown called the situation ""bizarre and unprecedented,"" and said that her staff would be ready if he resigned.Kitzhaber's office did not immediately return a request for comment on the details of the meeting. Despite his defiance on Wednesday, Democratic leaders in the legislature met with Kitzhaber on Thursday and told the four-term governor to resign,  according to The Oregonian. State Sen. Rod Monroe (D) told the paper that he thought Kitzhaber would probably resign on Thursday.""I've known John Kitzhaber longer than anyone else in the building,"" Monroe told The Oregonian. ""This is a sad day for Oregon."" Rumors that Kitzhaber would resign intensified this week after Oregon Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum (D) announced that  she had opened a criminal investigation into allegations that his fiancee, Cylvia Hayes, used her proximity to the governor for personal gain. Last week, The Oregonian reported that Kitzhaber did not disclose $118,000 in income she received from a clean energy group while also advising Kitzhaber on energy issues.Kitzhaber has said that that income did not constitute a conflict of interest that he needed to disclose.UPDATE, 9:34 p.m.: Willamette Week and 101.9 KINK/FM News 101 KXL also reported on Thursday that Kitzhaber's office had requested state officials delete thousands of e-mails from the governor's personal account on state servers. A Kitzhaber spokesperson told The Oregonian that the e-mails were inadvertently archived. "
9,POLITICS,Could A Court Ruling Keep DHS Open?,Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/obama-immigration-lawsuit_n_6672956.html,,2015-02-12,"US President Barack Obama speaks before signing the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act, H.R. 203, in the East Room of the White House in Washington, DC, February 12, 2015.

U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen of Brownsville, Texas, is expected to issue a ruling soon on an injunction requested by 26 states to prevent the Obama administration from going forward with recent executive actions on immigration as their lawsuit goes through the courts.Should he rule with the states in favor of an injunction, some Republicans in Congress say it could break the impasse on funding DHS, which is currently at a standstill despite a nearing Feb. 27 deadline.   The Republicans said it could be a game-changer, but they don't quite agree on how. Some said it might make them open to a bill to fund DHS without immigration measures, while others said that it would convince Senate Democrats to get on board with their bill to gut Obama's policies. ""That will bring in a different dynamic to the debate that we will have to think about,"" Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho) said Thursday at ""Conversations with Conservatives,"" an event with fellow conservative members and reporters. He added that it was too soon to speculate on what their actions would be should the judge issue an injunction. Labrador's state of Idaho is one of the 26 involved in the lawsuit, which is being led by Texas, and could be followed by legal action from the House. The states' suit contends that President Barack Obama went beyond his constitutional authority by announcing executive actions in November, largely aimed at parents of U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents, that could allow millions of undocumented immigrants to remain in the U.S. and work. The executive actions are also set to expand the existing Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals policy, or DACA, that lets undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children stay and receive work authorization. The White House has argued both policies are well within the president's authority of prosecutorial discretion. The first day the government will start accepting applications for the expanded DACA program is Feb. 18, so if the judge wants to issue the injunction before the actions begin, he would need to rule within the next several days.In the meantime, Congress is stalled on DHS funding. House Republicans have remained firm that they will not accept a bill that does not block Obama's actions, like the one they passed last month. Senate Democrats are blocking that legislation from moving forward. Republicans are somewhat boxed in -- if they accept a bill that funds DHS without immigration measures, they would be going back on numerous statements. If they don't, they could get the blame for a department shutdown. A ruling could give them a way out. Rep. Mick Mulvaney (R-S.C.) said he would not support a funding bill that lets the executive actions go forward. But should the judge issue an injunction, he said, he could consider approving funding for the department -- at least short-term -- without measures that defund the programs. ""My objection to the DHS funding is I don't want to do anything that gives the president the ability to fund the executive amnesty,"" he said at the same event for conservatives. ""If a court issues an injunction then I think it would be appropriate for us to consider the possibility of funding appropriations during the pendency of the injunction."" He noted there is a difference of opinion among conservatives on that point, which was quickly proven true when Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.) said an injunction would not be enough to convince him Obama would follow the rule of law. Some conservatives speculated -- perhaps optimistically -- that an injunction could convince Democrats to support the House-passed DHS funding bill. ""I think it's a great opportunity for the Senate Democrats to actually allow our bill to move forward,"" Rep. Tim Huelskamp (R-Kan.) said at the event. ""There should be no concerns to them if the courts are saying this is not going to be implemented.""Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), one of the biggest opponents of the executive actions in the upper chamber, took a similar view when asked if an injunction would change anything for the DHS funding impasse. ""I think it would have a huge impact,"" he told HuffPost. ""I would think it would be further proof that the president overreached and shouldn't be funded, and it would cause the Democrats to re-evaluate their obstruction."" "

Partner of Tasha Thomas. Son of Tressa Sherrod and John Crawford, Junior. Prospective university enrollee. But, above all, John Crawford III was a human being. Not a petty criminal, not a statistic. A human being.A man whose two sons, aged one and six months, are left fatherless. A man whose girlfriend was subjected to hours of verbal abuse and threats from Beavercreek Police before officers alerted her to the death of her partner, and died, tragically, less than a month after videotape of her ordeal went public. A man whose mother smiled at his plans to return to school and pursue his dream of becoming a meteorologist. A man whose father, upon learning of the passing of his namesake, said in response:""I worked under this system off and on for almost 20 years, under the criminal justice umbrella, and never before have I been so ashamed - that the same system that I carry out my duties is the same system that I'm receiving injustice from, the same system that we all are receiving injustice from.""In less than two seconds, from first contact to final gunshot, another life was lost.Tamir Rice, like John Crawford at one time, was a child. Tamir Rice, like John Crawford, was the boundless potential of youth. Most fatefully, Tamir Rice, like John Crawford, was an African-American with a toy gun in a public place in Ohio. A victim of incomplete or wholly inaccurate information provided to police, and of a bias older than the nation itself.What does it say about our nation when these facts alone are not enough to merit universal outrage? When a man can lie to the police and suffer no penalty, even as a toddler and infant are left fatherless as a result of his prevarications? When thought leaders suggest that protesters ignore the slaying of an 18-year-old college freshman to take up the defense of a slain 12-year-old child, because the optics are more disagreeable to the American mainstream? When video of a man being choked to death by a police officer is not strong enough evidence to warrant even a simple charge of reckless endangerment, though chokeholds have been outlawed by the police force in question for over twenty years? What does it say about our priorities? Our desires? Our values?It says that the premium paid to ensure our security is Black and Brown life. That wrongful death at the hands of law enforcement is simply the ""cost of doing business,"" to be shrugged off as abstract. That those who believe that this violence is a very real and present concern that must be addressed are extremists who must be silenced to preserve social order. That there are issues more pressing than the inability of a large swath of the American population to build and protect that which is most sacred, the foundation upon which our society is built -- a family, a community, a life.And so, the question becomes: what is left to say?I don't know that there's a quick and easy answer, or even a hope for an end to the perpetual state of terror under which Black women and men exist -- that is, no answer beyond the immediate and irrevocable end of White supremacy in the Western world. No discussion of ""privilege"" can adequately convey the state of the world, or the state of our Union, because so many White Americans can truthfully lay claim to being ""underprivileged"" in a social and economic sense, and thus ignore our plea for empathy. And so we must address our enemy by its name, clearly and openly. It is White supremacy that tells us that John Crawford's killer is not worth prosecuting. It is White supremacy that tells us that he and his girlfriend were on drugs at the time of the shooting. It is White supremacy that tells us that he pointed the BB gun at children in the store as shoppers ran, terrified. It is White supremacy that tells us that a Black man exercising his Second Amendment right in an open-carry state is a threat that must be neutralized with extreme prejudice, or that the law's suspicion and suppression of Black and Brown bodies is necessary to preserve order and liberty. It is White supremacy that we must combat -- and defeat -- in order for justice, in John Crawford's name, to truly be served. And, cliché as it sounds, this is only achievable through radical, defiant, revolutionary love.Genuine compassion for, and communion with, the families of our fallen must take place, and it must be universal. We must acknowledge and affirm the basic humanity of every living soul. We must stand together as one and proclaim loudly and honestly: Black lives matter. We need to believe it, and we need to follow through with it. Because only after Black life is loved, respected, and valued will Black life finally be allowed to flourish. Only then can our nation be made whole. This post is part of the ""28 Black Lives That Matter"" series produced by The Huffington Post for Black History Month.

Though Republican lawmakers in nearly every state have proposed drug tests for recipients of government benefits in recent years, Tennessee is one of only 12 states that have followed through with a testing program. Its results are typical: Very few poor people seeking benefits actually turned out to have dirty urine. Yet despite the dubious results, an additional dozen states have already started considering similar legislation this year. NCSL says that legislatures are looking at proposals to drug test welfare applicants in Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, Mississippi, Montana, New York, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas and West Virginia, where lawmakers advanced a bill in the state Senate on Tuesday. And Gov. Scott Walker (R) wants Wisconsin to become the next state to put such legislation on the books. He wants statehouse Republicans to mandate drug tests for unemployment insurance and a number of other state programs, and to seek permission from the Obama administration to drug test food stamp applicants. Wisconsin lawmakers haven't yet introduced a bill.Most drug testing proposals target Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the federal program most closely associated with the word ""welfare."" Federal law gives states some leeway to screen TANF applicants for drug usage. However, states are not permitted to make testing a condition of eligibility for unemployment insurance or food stamps, which, like TANF, are federal programs administered locally by states. Food stamps, which benefit 46 million Americans, have a much larger reach than TANF, which serves 3.4 million. Tennessee's testing program is typical of state schemes enacted since federal courts in 2011 stymied a testing regime in Florida that required every single applicant to urinate in a cup. At that time, the courts ruled that the program ran afoul of constitutional privacy protections. To circumvent the decision, Tennessee now asks all applicants to answer written questions about drug use, and those people who say they've used drugs are then physically tested. Such ""suspicion-based"" screening makes the law less vulnerable to challenge from the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, though it doesn't make the group happy. ""These latest reports that less than one quarter of one percent of Tennessee TANF applicants tested positive for drugs underscore that such testing is a waste of taxpayer money,"" Hedy Weinberg, director of Tennessee's ACLu chapter, said in a statement Wednesday.Backers of the drug test laws generally base their case on anecdotes from employers who say job applicants frequently fail drug tests. They also argue that even if the drug testing costs more than it saves, preventing taxpayer dollars from supporting drug abuse is a worthy expense.
