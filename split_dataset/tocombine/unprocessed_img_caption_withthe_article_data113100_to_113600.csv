Over the decades, Ebola cases have been confirmed in 10 African countries, including Congo where the disease was first reported in 1976. But until this year, Ebola had never come to West Africa. (AP Photo/Abbas Dulleh)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7ed9c2400005100572801.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NAIROBI, Kenya (RNS) As Western nations evacuate their citizens from West Africa’s growing Ebola outbreak, some Christian leaders have begun to speak of the virus as a curse from God.On Friday (August 8), the World Health Organization declared the Ebola crisis ravaging the region an international health emergency. On the same day, Nigeria became the latest country in West Africa to declare the virus crisis a national emergency, the day after Spain evacuated a priest and a nun from Liberia to Madrid.On Saturday (Aug. 9), a Congolese nun died from Ebola in Monrovia, the capital of Liberia, the AP reported.The outbreak started in December in Guinea, but was not discovered until March. It has since killed more than 1,000 people in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.“People are having different misconceptions that this is (a curse) from God,” said Bishop Sumoward Harris, now retired from the Lutheran Church in Liberia. “This is depending on how they are interpreting the Bible. But I don’t think God is angry and is issuing a punishment.”In Liberia, more than 100 Christian leaders meeting in early August declared that God was angry and Ebola a plague. They called for prayers to seek God’s forgiveness for sins including corruption and immoral acts such as homosexuality.Liberia’s Wilmot Kotati Bobbroh, head of the Living Water Pentecostal Church, later described the outbreak as a national curse brought by God to force repentance. Bobbroh said chlorine and soap were not working, but God’s mercy was saving people.In Sierra Leone, a similar view is gaining credence, according to Ebun James–Dekam, general secretary of the Council of Churches in Sierra Leone.“It has some similarities to what happened when the HIV/AIDS epidemic first occurred,” said James-Dekam.Initially those infected with Ebola in Sierra Leone had relied on treatment from traditional healers, but this was shown to be ineffective, she said.“Virtually all churches are relying on medical professional for treatment,” she added.Harris said the virus spread quickly because little was known about it and the government had not mounted a robust response.“The people had started taking relatives to prayer houses, while others administered herbal treatment,” Harris said. “By the time we realized this was an epidemic, it had grown out of proportion. We are now overwhelmed,” said Harris, while citing an urgent need for medical personnel and services."

2,ENTERTAINMENT,It's About Time to Renew Playing House,"Cara Joy David, ContributorNew York-based entertainment journalist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/its-about-time-to-renew-p_b_5669359.html,"Let me tell you, none of the new comedies this summer are as good as Playing House.",2014-08-11,2014-07-28-playinghouse_aspot_generic_2490x1418_watchfinale.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-07-28-playinghouse_aspot_generic_2490x1418_watchfinale-thumb.jpg,"It has been two weeks since my last post on Playing House. It still has not been renewed. Last week, as part of TV Line's regular ""Burning Questions"" feature, the site asked: ""Isn't it about time Playing House got renewed?"" Yes, it is. Yet there has been no word.Meanwhile, I've upheld my tradition of watching at least the first episode -- and usually the first two episodes -- of every scripted show. Let me tell you, none of the new comedies this summer are as good as Playing House. Despite Rory O'Malley's welcome presence, Partners is one of the worst sitcoms I've seen in years. Seriously. Absolutely charmless. FX's other comedies fare better. Married is fine. As it stars Judy Greer, I wanted it to be better than fine, but it's fine. (It may improve when, and if, it focuses more on Greer. Right now it feels very Nat Faxon heavy. On a semi-related note, I highly recommend Greer's book, I Don't Know What You Know Me From: Confessions of a Co-Star.) You're The Worst is actually the best of the summer crop. I'm not sure where it is going -- I can already feel it getting slightly tired -- but I've been entertained by it thus far. I very much wanted to support two-time Tony winner Andrea Martin (soon to return to Pippin) by watching Working the Engels. Sadly, she has to push too hard to carry the material, which is simply not funny. Welcome to Sweden has potential, but half of the humor is in subtitles. Is it wrong that I think that requires too much commitment? A show has to be really funny to be worth that much focus. This one is okay, but not worth the energy. I also tried out The CW's Backpackers and Seed and I think maybe one or two others. Playing House was superior to all of these.Of course, like Playing House,none of the above have been renewed yet. Thankfully last week it was announced that Black Box (which was not a comedy, but was hilarious for about five minutes) will not be returning, so there is hope that someone controlling decisions on at least one network has some sense. If another person with sense is at USA, Playing House will be renewed. The others can suffer whatever fate they will. I only bring them up because they are each not as successful as Playing House.What makes Playing House more effective in my mind? The ability to find humor in honest relationships. Of the new summer comedies, the show that feels the most fundamentally honest is Married. But that just isn't that funny. (Welcome to Sweden is second in this respect.) Even with the over-the-top scenarios in Playing House, the fundamental relationships all seem very real. (In an odd juxtaposition, when you search ""Playing House"" on Google news, you get my last post first and then a story about ""The Playing House Project,"" which involves mannequins and one real woman posing as a typical family.) I have always believed the thing that makes Modern Family so successful is that it is somehow relatable. We all think we have that family, or at least some aspect of it. Lennon Parham and Jessica St. Clair are best friends and it shows in the comedy. Many people have friends they would totally move in with if they were pregnant and needed someone. Many people have a goofy sibling (though possibly not one as sympathetic as Zach Woods). Many people have a boy they left behind (played brilliantly in this case by Keegan-Michael Key). As I stated in my last column, I think the audience for this show will only grow next season when the characters are experiencing motherhood. I know when Modern Family's Cam and Mitchell were experiencing certain things with Lily, I told my best friend, who has a young son, to watch. As for Playing House, I've basically made all my friends watch every episode already. But, for the one pregnant friend who isn't watching, I did make the birth episode required viewing. After all, that is so something my friends would do. Most of us do not lie (I personally could never go into sales for this reason), but we're not opposed to going along with something we know isn't true... to a point. This will hopefully be my last Playing House post as I am confident by the time I return from vacation it will be renewed. USA Network, do it. TV Line and countless others are right -- it is about time. Read my latest New York Times Story here. Tweet me your comments to this post and more @CaraJoyDavid or email me at carajoy@gmail.com."

Kurdish authorities at the border believe some 45,000 Yazidis passed the river crossing in the past week and thousands more are still stranded in the mountains. (AP Photo/ Khalid Mohammed)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13ba226000052007099ca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The international community's response to the humanitarian crisis in Iraq driven by ISIS jihadists against minorities has been grossly inadequate and slow. The founding words of the United Nations -- ""Never again"" -- ring hollow as the UN and powerful member states lack the willpower to intervene and prevent the genocide of religious minorities, yet again.As ISIS seeks to establish a Sunni Caliphate in the Middle East, their advances ""bear all the warning signs and hallmarks of genocide"" against communities and individuals who do not share their faith. Hundreds of thousands of Christians, Yazidis and other minorities have been forced to convert, pay jizya and live in submission, or flee empty-handed. There are plentiful accounts of the massacring of minority men, the kidnapping, rape and selling of minority women and even the murder of innocent minority children. ISIS militants killed at least 500 Yazidis, burying some alive and taking hundreds of women as slaves, an Iraqi government minister told Reuters Sunday. Cultural cleansing has reached unprecedented levels. With such abominable barbarities, humanity is facing a real incarnation of evil.The UN Security Council's statement last week, condemning ISIS actions and calling on member states to provide humanitarian aid, rings hollow and shows duplicity when compared with others. The effacement of Europe on the international scene at this tragic moment is shameful.President Obama has finally started to react, by authorizing limited air strikes to defend ""American interests"" in Iraq, bolster the threatened Kurdish region and deliver some humanitarian aid. Yet, the response is woefully inadequate. It falls far short of what the catastrophic situation on the ground requires. Essentially preserving the status quo, this response fails to make it an objective to drive the dark forces of ISIS into retreating. It also fails to recognize that ISIS is an international -- not just Iraqi -- problem, as a hotbed of terrorism makes roots in such a vital area.In response to the current genocide and humanitarian crisis, the UN and its member states, especially the United States, need to take these six steps:1. Authorize air strikes against ISIS by NATO or an alliance of willing countries.2. Refer ISIS leaders to the International Criminal Court.3. Create safe havens for the minority communities in Iraq and Syria.4. Provide arms to the Kurdish Peshmerga for their self-defense and protection of the minorities who have sought refuge in the Kurdish-controlled region.5. Expose and block the financial networks that support ISIS.6. Develop a plan to assist refugees' return to their homes.The West has blood on its hands by its past actions and inactions that helped ""create"" the current situation. Leaders of the international community bear responsibility for the agony and deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children. Now is the time for immediate action -- not for more empty, feel-good statements and posturing by the international community."

He created an investigative commission that lurched into the world of petty thievery, and then lurched into the more interesting question of who was giving huge dollars to who, and for what.",2014-08-11,"New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo speaks at a rally in support of charter schools on the steps of the Capitol in Albany, N.Y., on Tuesday, March 4, 2014. Thousands of charter school supporters from around New York state took part in the rally. (AP Photo/Tim Roske)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e69159b230000841839f66a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There's been some, not a lot, of national attention to a New York scandal that has kept the chattering and political classes agog and aghast. Long story short, Cuomo kept hammering the legislature as corrupt, evidenced by a series of thefts and misappropriations. He created an investigative commission that lurched into the world of petty thievery, and then lurched into the more interesting question of who was giving huge dollars to who, and for what. This is the murky world of legal corruption.The Cuomo operation decided this was not where things should be heading. He's raised well over $30 million (more than all other governors combined, I'm told), largely from real estate, oil and gas, financial and marriage equality interests. There were memos from lobbyists saying they pay to play, subpoenas issued or planned, and a series of hypocritical and dishonest statements by Cuomo. The consequence was a New York Times article that laid out public and private evidence that as soon as the inquiry shifted to Cuomo, he shut it down hard and fast.It's played intensely in the press. His Republican opponent, Rob Astorino, has been unable to make much of it, largely because he was unable to figure out how to talk about a real scandal, after honing his style on a series of fake ones (sounds like DC). His Democratic primary opponent, Zephyr Teachout, is a smart academic with progressive credentials but she's been struggling to make the ballot and raise money.Cuomo was hoping it would blow over. He laid low for a couple of weeks, and then, in an amazingly clumsy move, orchestrated a chorus of support from witnesses and participants. The US Attorney smacked him hard for possible witness tampering, so he finally shut up.Sounds like the stuff of electoral upset.Well, no, or not yet, if you believe the polls. A new poll by Siena College shows that voters 1) don't know a lot about the events, 2) believe he did interfere with the investigation and 3) don't care. Jobs, schools, health care and economic growth are what they want to hear about.No surprise and probably not a bad thing. While comforting to Cuomo in the short run, the poll is really a blueprint for a real electoral attack that could work. What the goo-goos view as issue No. 1 is well behind voters concern for their well-being and the well-being of their communities.However, there's on ongoing investigation by the US Attorney apparently looking at obstruction of justice charges. And there's a real opportunity for Teachout and Astorino to connect the big givers in real estate, fracking, charter schools etc with Cuomo's policies and proposals. Either could connect the dots and shift the landscape.Cuomo developed a meme for a Democrat interested in national politics. He became a ""progractionary"" leftleftleft on social issues like gay marriage and guns, and rightrightright on economic issues where he cut taxes for business and the wealthy. Hillary aside, he may have stepped all over his own chances to sell that to Democratic voters nationally. Character and temperament matter even if corruption doesn't move the electorate. If nothing else it will be an interesting few months."
6,MEDIA,A New Host On 'Meet The Press' Isn't Going To Solve Its Problems,Jason Linkins,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/meet-the-press-chuck-todd_n_5669635.html,,2014-08-11,"WASHINGTON - MARCH 23: NBC News Political Director Chuck Todd (L), speaks as moderator Tim Russert (R) looks on during a taping of 'Meet the Press' at the NBC studios March 23, 2008 in Washington, DC. Todd discussed the presidential race for the elections in November, 2008. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images for Meet the Press)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb5bec41f00003901247dc9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As noted earlier this morning, the David Gregory rumor mill has spun round to the news, courtesy of Politico's Playbook, that Chuck Todd is reportedly now the ""likely successor to David Gregory"" as the show's master of ceremonies.""Meet The Press"" has been a somewhat troubled institution lately, but this isn't the move I would have made to fix it. Of course, I would have simply canceled the show in favor of broadcasting more soccer games. Or tennis! The best iterations of ""Meet The Press"" in the past few years have been when ""Meet The Press"" was actually The French Open. I've learned a lot more about the state of contemporary politics from watching clay-court specialists than I have from watching David Gregory.But I reckon that if you'd read this far (why did you do that?), then you'd probably like a ""more productive"" answer than ""cancel 'Meet The Press.'"" Well, here we go.""Meet The Press"" has been experiencing a prolonged period of debacle-licious ratings woes this year, with Gregory himself frequently being presented as the origin of said woe. But while it is true that Gregory's chief qualification as a host of ""Meet The Press"" is his ability to reflect waves of light, the show's ratings problems really cannot be blamed solely on Gregory. As I've previously explained, none of these Sunday shows get impressive ratings as a general rule. And that's because their audience is basically limited to three groups of people: Beltway insiders, really old people, and people who have become immobilized on a semi-permanent basis and are thus unable to reach their remote controls and change the channel. Ratings for ""Meet The Press"" for Aug. 3 were, according to TV Newser, 2.113 million total viewers, with a scant 584,000 coming from the demographic of 25-year-olds to 54-year-olds. However, Aug. 3's big winner, ""This Week,"" only notched 2.587 million viewers, with a mere 746,000 coming from the 25-54 demo. So it's wrong to say ""Meet The Press'"" ratings are bad. ""This Week's"" ratings are bad! ""Meet The Press'"" ratings are just worse. This is one big ""tallest hobbit"" contest.The question then becomes, ""How do we build a new audience for this show?"" And I'm afraid there are no easy answers. (I mean, besides the super-easy ""cancel the show"" answer.) But you can comfortably disabuse yourself of the notion that simply replacing David Gregory will somehow fix the problem. This part of Playbook's reporting says it all:The move is an effort by NBC News President Deborah Turness to restore passion and insider cred to a network treasure that has been adrift since the death in 2008 of the irreplaceable Tim Russert. Although Todd is not a classic television performer guaranteed to wow focus groups, his NBC bosses have been impressed by his love of the game, which brings with it authenticity, sources, and a loyal following among newsmakers and political junkies.Chuck Todd is an intelligent, reasonably informed journalist who seems to be a genuinely decent person. That's an improvement over Gregory. Is he passionate? He loves politics and process. Beyond that, his sense of passion seems to have limits. Passionate people, for instance, can't wait to explain stuff to ordinary human Americans. That's not a job Todd wants. Todd is the guy who once lamented that a poll indicated that a majority of Americans didn't understand what the debt ceiling was, and then shrugged and said that ""the president has to use political capital and time to flip these numbers,"" as if there wasn't a teevee camera pointed at him at that moment with the ability to broadcast information to people. Chuck Todd exists somewhere on the spectrum between ""disinterested"" and ""uninterested.""More to the point, however: If there's one thing that ""Meet The Press"" does not need right now, it's a greater emphasis on the following: ""insider cred,"" ""love of the game,"" ""authenticity,"" ""sources"" (unless we are talking about some other, different group of ""sources"" -- and we aren't) and more ""newsmakers and political junkies"" in the audience. What the people behind ""Meet The Press"" don't seem to understand is that they are currently maxed out on these things. They have gone just as far as they possibly can with those ingredients. There needs to be some tough coming-to-grips.The big problem is that ""Meet The Press"" isn't participating in the modern, 21st-century news environment. If the show was participating in the same world as the rest of us, they'd recognize that the audience they want is well-versed in the stories of the week, and that they've already absorbed the talking points of the major players, availed themselves of a wealth of insight and expertise, and have even participated in their own discussions on current events. So when Sunday rolls around and ""Meet The Press"" indulges itself in its childlike devotion to starting over at the beginning, people think, ""Really, what's the use?"" Imagine slogging your way through a long novel, taking the time to document and ruminate upon the experience, supplementing your own discoveries by seeking out relevant insights and criticism, and then at the end of the week some 10th-grader jumps in your face, recites the Cliffs Notes to the novel out loud while asking you to consider buying an erectile dysfunction treatment. That's basically how most normal human Americans view ""Meet The Press.""One doesn't get the sense that the producers of ""Meet The Press"" have in any way accounted for the sophistication of the show's potential audience. Instead, they are operating at the lowest level of news-gathering -- the perfect level for their guests to dispense the talking points they've been whittling into a fine point over the course of the week. The host's only purpose, it seems, is to move the guests off their talking points. It's a hollow enterprise with rare impact in the real world. Rather than enjoin a high-level dissection, the Sunday shows present a remedial form of news that simply cannot appeal to any significant section of the population. So, how to solve a problem like this? Previously, Jonathan Bernstein and Paul Waldman have made a lot of great suggestions. Waldman's First Rule should be gospel: ""The people you bring on should 1) know as much as possible about the things you're going to discuss, and 2) have little if any interest in spinning."" Many people have suggested that ""Meet The Press"" return to the format of its heyday, in which officials were subjected to a no-frills grilling by a panel of reporters. I also tend to think that shows like ""Meet The Press"" suffer from an access problem -- that is to say, they are so concerned with maintaining their access to political elites that the shows are now effectively a no-accountability salon. Somehow, somewhere a wire has gotten crossed and ""Meet The Press"" has become party to a set of perverse incentives. I've previously highlighted how Las Vegas-based political reporter Jon Ralston has managed to keep his journalistic enterprise running according to the correct polarity. Ralston benefits from the fact that the people who avoid his tough questions are quickly and easily branded as cowards. Somehow, the Sunday shows have got to figure out a way back to that. If they're to have guests, those guests should be made to feel uncomfortable. If they refuse to come on the show, they should be further brutalized. Let's face it: If the prevailing idea is, ""We need to keep Beltway toffs happy or our ratings will suffer,"" then that idea isn't working anyway, so it's well past time to get the knives out.Beyond that, ""Meet The Press"" should of course never have anyone who carries the title ""campaign consultant"" or ""political strategist"" anywhere near its studio. And it should dispense with all panel discussions altogether, because they are entirely without value. There are Funyun crumbs on the floor of the PATH train that have fewer empty calories than the average ""Meet The Press"" panel-wank.But all of these suggestions ... they are just as hoary and overplayed as John McCain. And they don't really get to that whole ""adapting to the modern news environment"" and its sophisticated, curious and purpose-driven audience that's long avoided tuning in on Sunday. So here's a radical idea that can set ""Meet The Press"" on an entirely new path -- one that might worry its competitors.Go longform. One of the most surprising things about the Sunday shows in general is that they are producing the same disposable content as the average cable news show, and expecting their vaunted time slot and more elite guests to take them to the summit of broadcast news. But shows like ""Meet The Press"" have a six-day lead in which to craft their broadcast. There's no reason that it should look like it was slapped together in the parking lot on Saturday afternoon. The obvious adaptation is to make use of the resource of time, and go deeper and longer into the stories.I mean, why not? As social media increasingly becomes the new front page, the whole notion of broadcast television as the pre-eminent source of both ""breaking news"" and disposable content is going to become more and more passe. The future of television news belongs to people who can take their cameras places other people can't, use the medium creatively, and deliver ""slow"" news. The future of CNN's content, for example, isn't ""Crossfire,"" it's ""Blackfish."" Why not make ""Meet The Press"" the first to join the future?Right now, NBC News can deploy all sorts of reporters across the country, finding out how normal human Americans are struggling or succeeding and explaining how and why that is. Great opportunities lie in wait beyond the Beltway, to do things like Frontline's ""Two American Families."" But even if the world beyond the Potomac River is scary to ""Meet The Press'"" producers, a lot of work can still be done on Capitol Hill: Reporters can take us inside the legislative wranglings, explain the interests the drive the debate, and expose the identities of the people who pay members of Congress to think a certain way.One of the best things that has happened to broadcast news this year is the advent of HBO's new show, ""Last Week Tonight."" ""Last Week Tonight"" was advertised in a shaggy-dog sort of way, with its host -- former Daily Show correspondent and fill-in host Jon Oliver -- explaining what a poor job the show was going to do at keeping up with the newscycle and reporting the news. Then it debuted, and instantly demonstrated that what they'd always intended was to do a better job then everyone else. (The fact that it is, technically, a ""Sunday show"" is not a coincidence.)The speed with which ""Last Week Tonight"" has surpassed nearly all comers in terms of quality should really alarm people. As a representative example, here is ""Last Week Tonight's"" segment on the legislative wranglings and regulations surrounding the nutritional supplement industry, a topic that at first blush seems like it would be more dull than a test pattern designed by Samuel Beckett:This content beats ""Meet The Press"" coming and going. The show literally wandered right onto ""Meet The Press'"" Beltway turf and delivered a report with a sophistication that no Sunday show has pulled off in years. It explains without being condescending. It gets ""inside"" the story without fronting like an ""insider."" It treats the audience as people who are capable of handling the material, while remaining concerned enough about the matter to show its audience things they don't already know. And then they really report the facts that have remained occluded. This is one of those enterprises where the secret, hidden information is actual information and not some pundit's exercise in counter-intuition. This 16-minute segment attracted 3,889,379 views in its YouTube shell alone. If ""Meet The Press"" could pull off numbers like that, it would be time to throw a parade down Constitution Avenue. At this point, you would hang a ""Meet The Press"" segment with that large an audience in the Newseum. (As it happens, NBC News doesn't do a good job tending to its brand on YouTube. There's no dedicated ""Meet The Press"" channel. Still, for a representative demonstration of the level of interest in its content, here's David Gregory's interview with John Kerry, attempting to defend President Barack Obama's foreign policy record. It's taken home a scintillating 497 views.)Of course, it helps that ""Last Week Tonight"" is also screamingly funny. This is something that ""Meet The Press"" would definitely be better off never, ever attempting, ever. But it's not jokes that that are getting people to stick around and watch 16 minutes on nutrition supplements. It's the purpose. It's the fact that the show wanted to have a point. It's the fact that the producers and writers and host visibly put in the work. And it's the fact that they convincingly demonstrate real respect and genuine concern for their audience, instead of trying to get over by posing as an ""insider"" operating under a veil of savviness.The dirty little secret of ""Meet The Press"" and its Sunday show ilk is that you can very easily distill them down to their essence: ""Bomb or don't bomb, have a debt ceiling default or don't have a debt ceiling default, fix the problem or don't fix the problem -- we get paid either way."" The ethos of ""What, me worry?"" is a turn-off for most rational people, all of whom have someone that they have to take responsibility for -- spouses, siblings, parents, children, friends -- while Sunday show hosts promise softballs for access and brand-management opportunities for wealthy thought-havers. The most compelling and honest thing one can say about ""Meet The Press"" is that a radical change will do it a lot of good.But I guess it's Chuck Todd and a new deck chair configuration instead. That's OK. People clearly have better options.[Would you like to follow me on Twitter? Because why not?]Enjoy reading this article?

Following one scandal after another, the Acts 29 Network -- which he helped found -- removed his standing and his church's standing within the network. They also encouraged him to step down as the leader of Mars Hill.To add to that, Lifeway Bookstores, which is one of the biggest faith-based book chains around, decided to stop carrying all of Driscoll's books. Basically this just means he can join me and all of us progressive Christian authors who have been edged out by Lifeway. You'll get used to it, Mark.All of this is good for Christianity as a whole. For starters, it demonstrates the autonomy of the Acts 29 Network from their founder. And despite their many misguided policies regarding women and their proclivity for hyper-calvinism overall, it shows that they, too, have their limits.As for Lifeway, I can't really tell if their decision to drop Driscoll is an ethical one, or a matter of mitigating further PR risk by having his titles in their stores. Either way, props for getting his face off the shelves, regardless.I'd not be surprised, too, if Driscoll chooses to step down from Mars Hill in the near future. At some point, even he will recognize his leadership as untenable.In the midst of all of this, I'm conflicted. Yes, I've been as vocal of a champion as anyone else for removing his authority as voice advocating for the Gospel in the world. His actions, words and general demeanor are hurtful toward women, non-Christians or pretty much anyone who doesn't agree with him or conform to his mandates for what it means to be a man or a follower of Jesus.So where's the conflict? Frankly, I hate that it comes to this. There are plenty of ways his voice could have been attenuated or silenced without the drama and humiliation. Granted, he's done it to himself by continuing down these many self-destructive paths, but it doesn't make it pleasant to watch.I'm also saddened when I see anyone -- especially someone who calls themselves a Christian -- rejoicing in his humiliation or suffering. Yes, we can find hope and encouragement in him being held accountable, but to revel in his public shaming is not Christ-like.Finally, anyone who suggests this is God's way of dishing back to Driscoll what he deserves, shame on you. First, do we honestly believe a God of infinite love, mercy and compassion plays such games, keeping tabs and then pulling the proverbial trigger right at the moment when one's fall will be the hardest? That's not the God of my understanding. Second, so help us if any of us gets everything we deserve. Think, just for a moment, of the sum total of your own sins and shortcoming; now, imagine ""getting what's coming to you."" Is that ""eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth,"" sort of justice really what we want from God and for ourselves?Or do we really believe the things Jesus said about responding to hate with love, about loving our enemies, and about finding creative, divinely inspired ways for grace and beauty to emerge even from the shit-piles we make of our lives sometimes, Mark Driscoll included?Driscoll has an opportunity here to re-invent himself into someone who embodies resilience, grace and humility? Will he do it? Only God and he know. Whatever his course of action, it should be done out from behind the public microphone he's had the privilege of dominating for so long.But as for you, Mark Driscoll the man, I'll be doing my best to pray for you. I don't want to, but that's exactly why I need to."

Meaning is Personal If there were sound effects, you would be hearing the needle scratch across a record right now. Why? Because I am not a content marketer. I am not a marketer. I am not here to tell you what or how to think. I am here to create. I create something that means something to me. A place I've been, an experience I've lived through. I can tell you how I got there, what happened to me and what I did about it, but you will never go through the same thing as me. It's impossible. To start with, you are not me. You are you. Personally, I like it that way. But even if you experience the same thing as me, it didn't happen at the same time or the same place and if you look at all the details, for as similar as the situation was, it has many more differences. So why would I even share anything with you?The Art of Creation  By creating something, and allowing others to see it, we are sharing our art. My words may never be compared to a painting by Dali or statue by Picasso, but they are my creation. The beauty of art lies in how you view it. It's personal. You may relate to it, you may not. You may take something away from it or you could ignore it. My job as the artist is to create, not to form judgement.  As soon as I started deciding what I wanted you to take away from my writing, I was altering my work to elicit a specific response from you. I was forming a judgement on how you would react. All storytellers could be marketers, but not every marketer can be a storyteller. So What Truly Matters? If I wanted you to buy this, or sign up for that, or make you want to go tell your friends about them, this post could still be told as story, but would have a very different message. And that is the point of this post. Do we really need everything to have a point? I think this has been what has been holding me back. Preventing me from creating. It had me focused on producing, which is work, not art. So take from this what you want, because I certainly didn't have any point when I started writing it and still don't."

'The Kurdish peshmerga forces have succeeded in making 30,000 Yazidis who fled Mount Sinjar, most of them women and children, cross into Syria and return to Kurdistan,' said Shawkat Barbahari, a Kurdhish official who is in charge of the Fishkhabur crossing with Syria.

There seems little doubt that the self-styled radical Islamist group, Islamic State, is committing genocide in Iraq, certainly against the Yazidis, and has targeted Christians to ""convert or die"" as well. The question is, can you bomb and drone Hell back into the pit of human evil from which it came? The world has come to think so, but we need to be very cautious in making this case. Fixing ""Hell"" is the very definition of moral dilemma. In fact, it is important, in my view, not to mistake this U.S. effort in Iraq for anything other than military interventionism wrapped in humanitarianism. That does not mean, however, the humanitarianism should not be undertaken. That's why this is a ""problem from Hell.""   Genocide is called ""A Problem from Hell"" by Samantha Power, now U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, in her extensive 2003 book by that name because genocide is the destruction of human life for the sake of wiping a whole people from the earth. As the United Nations defines genocide, it is ""any act committed with the idea of destroying in whole or in part a national, ethnic, racial or religious group."" The United States has now intervened in Iraq, both with humanitarian supplies and by bombing Islamic State targets. The doctrine of humanitarian intervention, or what is now more technically called Responsibility to Protect (R2P) was developed following the genocides in Rwanda and the Balkans in the 1990s. While the Holocaust during World War II had produced solemn pledges of ""never again,"" the fact was that genocide did happen again, and especially in regard to Rwanda, the world did nothing. I devote considerable attention, when I teach Peacemaking and Human Security courses, as this syllabus with Sharon Welch shows to the question of humanitarian intervention, and how Responsibility to Protect fits in with that concept. States rarely, if ever, act out of purely out of humanitarian impulses, as the ""Christian Realist"" theologian and ethicist, Reinhold Niebuhr, was fond of reminding us. President Obama has actually stated, in making his case for the humanitarian aid and bombing campaign in Iraq, that this also to protect Americans he sent there as advisors. But that is not, I believe, the only American interests we are protecting there. Islamic State threatens a massive destabilization of the whole Middle East, an area already dangerously destabilized. But will American military reengagement help reduce conflict in the region, or exacerbate it? Our last two interventions, in the Bush administrations wars, are a large part of this current catastrophe in the making.There is a strong concern, not only on my part but on the part of others, that Responsibility to Protect is a doctrine that makes a ""soft case"" for military interventionism. This, in fact, is an argument made by an extensive, and excellent May 2014 report by the Global Policy Forum, In Whose Name? A Critical View on the Responsibility to Protect. An examination of the genesis of R2P suggests that the facts are on the side of those who see military action as the core of the doctrine... Military force is central to the ICISS [International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty] report, and its militarism is at times striking... R2P proponents often argue that the real risk comes from too few military inventions.The case is made by proponents of R2P that prevention is the goal, but the prevention case is made by other doctrines, notably that of Just Peace. What distinguishes R2P from the Just Peace paradigm, in fact, is that R2P is an unstable mix of peacemaking and forceful interventionism. R2P incorporates ""military intervention within the same norm as conflict prevention and peace support operations [and that] skews the whole R2P doctrine towards the extreme option of coercive intervention, which tends to become the center of the entire principle,"" per the Global Policy Forum report.So what are we supposed to do? Let Islamic State bury women and children alive, brutally massacre religious groups and drive them out of their homes? No. That's what makes this a hellish problem. Just do not mistake this for anything other than military intervention that has some humanitarian goals, namely getting supplies to people who desperately need them and helping provide a safety corridor so that they might escape Islamic State. But when you see bombers and drones in action, know that this is military interventionism to ""protect American interests,"" and not mistake it for anything else."

Iraq's Shiite prime minister on Wednesday, June 25, 2014 rejected calls to form an interim ""national salvation government"" that critics say would allow the country's squabbling sects to quickly present a unified front in the face of a growing threat by Sunni militants who have seized several cities this month.

An eyewitness said a tank was stationed at the entrance to Baghdad's Green Zone, which houses government buildings.In a speech on state television, Maliki accused Iraq's Kurdish President Fouad Masoum of violating the constitution by missing a deadline for him to ask the biggest political bloc to nominate a prime minister and form a government.""I will submit today an official complaint to the federal court against the president of the Republic for committing a clear constitutional violation for the sake of political calculations,"" said Maliki.Serving in a caretaker capacity since an inconclusive election in April, Maliki has defied calls by Sunnis, Kurds, some fellow Shi'ites, regional power broker Iran and Iraq's top cleric for him to step aside for a less polarizing figure.Critics accuse Maliki of pursuing a sectarian agenda which has sidelined Sunnis and prompted some of them to support Islamic State militants, whose latest sweep through northern Iraq has alarmed the Baghdad government and its Western allies.Washington seems to be losing patience with Maliki, who has placed Shi'ite political loyalists in key positions in the army and military and drawn comparisons with executed former dictator Saddam Hussein, the man he plotted against from exile for years.The United States voiced its support for Masoum after Maliki, whom Washington has blamed for stoking Iraq's security crisis, criticized him.""We reaffirm our support for a process to select a prime minister who can represent the aspirations of the Iraqi people by building a national consensus and governing in an inclusive manner,"" Deputy State Department Spokeswoman Marie Harf said in a statement.""We reject any effort to achieve outcomes through coercion or manipulation of the constitutional or judicial process,"" Harf said, adding that the United States ""fully supports"" Masoum in his role as the guarantor of Iraq's constitution.U.S. President Barack Obama urged Iraqi politicians on Saturday to form a more inclusive government that can counter the growing threat from the Islamic State.But Maliki keeps digging in.""Now we can see unprecedented deployment of army commandos and special elite forces deployed in Baghdad, especially sensitive areas close to the green zone and the entrances of the capital,"" one of the police sources said.""These forces are now taking full responsibility of securing these areas of the capital.""Iraq's Interior Ministry has told police to be on high alert in connection with Maliki's speech, a police official told Reuters.The Islamic State has capitalized on political deadlock and sectarian tensions that have made it easier for the group to make fresh gains after arriving in the north in June from Syria.The group, which sees Shi'ites as infidels who deserve to be killed, has ruthlessly moved through one town after another, using tanks and heavy weapons it seized from soldiers who fled in the thousands.Islamic State militants have killed hundreds of Iraq's minority Yazidis, burying some alive and taking women as slaves, an Iraqi government minister said on Sunday, as U.S. warplanes again bombed the insurgents.Human rights minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani accused the Sunni Muslim insurgents - who have ordered the community they regard as ""devil worshippers"" to convert to Islam or die - of celebrating what he called a ""a vicious atrocity"".No independent confirmation was available of the killings of hundreds of Yazidis, bloodshed that could increase pressure on Western powers to do more to help tens of thousands of people, including many from religious and ethnic minorities, who have fled the Islamic State's offensive.The U.S. Central Command said drones and jet aircraft had hit Islamic State armed trucks and mortar positions near Arbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdish region which had been relatively stable throughout the past decade of turmoil until the insurgents swept across northwestern Iraq this summer.That marked a third successive day of U.S. air strikes, and Central Command said in its statement that they were aimed at protecting Kurdish peshmerga forces as they face off against the militants near Arbil, the site of a U.S. consulate and a U.S.-Iraqi joint military operations center.The U.S. State Department said on Sunday it had pulled some of its staff from the Arbil consulate for their safety.The Islamists' advance in the past week has forced tens of thousands to flee, threatened Arbil and provoked the first U.S. attacks since Washington withdrew troops from Iraq in late 2011, nearly nine years after invading to oust Saddam Hussein.Iraqi rights minister Sudani told Reuters in a telephone interview that accounts of the killings had come from people who had escaped the town of Sinjar, an ancient home of the Yazidis, a Kurdish-speaking community whose religion has set them apart from Muslims and other local faiths.""We have striking evidence obtained from Yazidis fleeing Sinjar and some who escaped death, and also crime scene images that show indisputably that the gangs of the Islamic State have executed at least 500 Yazidis after seizing Sinjar,"" he said.""Some of the victims, including women and children were buried alive in scattered mass graves in and around Sinjar.""Consolidating a territorial grip that includes tracts of Syrian desert and stretches toward Baghdad, the Islamic State's local and foreign fighters have swept into areas where non-Sunni groups live. While they persecute non-believers in their path, that does not seem to be the main motive for their latest push.The group wants to establish religious rule in a caliphate straddling Syria and Iraq and has tapped into widespread anger among Iraq's Sunnis at a democratic system dominated by the Shi'ite Muslim majority following the U.S. invasion of 2003.Obama warned on Saturday that there was no quick fix for the crisis that threatens to tear Iraq apart.Kurdish regional president Masoud Barzani urged his allies to send arms to help his forces hold off the militants, who have bases across the Syrian border. During a visit by French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, Barzani said: ""We are not fighting a terrorist organization, we are fighting a terrorist state.""Another senior Kurdish official said Kurds retook two towns southwest of Arbil, Guwair and Makhmur, with the help of U.S. strikes. But he did not expect a rapid end to the fighting.In Jalawla, 115 km (70 miles) northeast of Baghdad, a suicide bomber killed 10 Kurdish forces and wounded 80 people on Sunday. Kurdish fighters and Islamic militants are locked in fierce clashes in the town.Fabius, noting how Islamic State fighters had taken the upper hand after seizing heavy weaponry from Iraqi troops who fled in June, said the European Union would look into bolstering the Kurds' arsenal to help them hold out and hit back. TAKEN AS ""SLAVES""Sudani said: ""The terrorist Islamic State has also taken at least 300 Yazidi women as slaves and locked some of them inside a police station in Sinjar and transferred others to the town of Tal Afar. We are afraid they will take them outside the country.""In some of the images we have obtained there are lines of dead Yazidis who have been shot in the head while the Islamic State fighters cheer and wave their weapons over the corpses,"" he added. ""This is a vicious atrocity.""U.S. military aircraft have dropped relief supplies to tens of thousands of Yazidis who are trapped on the desert top of nearby Mount Sinjar, seeking shelter from the insurgents.A spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency in Iraq said some 30,000 Iraqis had since Friday reached safety in Kurdistan after traveling on the Syrian side of the border from Sinjar.At the Vatican, Pope Francis held a silent prayer for victims of the Iraq conflict: ""Thousands of people, among them many Christians, banished brutally from their houses, children dying of hunger and thirst as they flee, women kidnapped, people massacred, violence of all kinds,"" he said in a Sunday address.""All of this deeply offends God and deeply offends humanity."" MALIKI CRITICISMFrance joined the calls for Iraq's feuding leaders to form an inclusive government capable of countering the militants.""Iraq is in need of a broad unity government,"" Foreign Minister Fabius said in Baghdad. ""All Iraqis should feel they are represented to take part in this battle against terrorism.""The pressure from France came a day after Obama described the upheaval in the north as a ""wake-up call"" to Iraqis who have slipped back into sectarian bloodshed not seen since 2006-2007.Nearly every day police report kidnappings, bombings and execution-style killings in many cities, towns and villages. In Baghdad, police were on Sunday manning some squares in armored personnel carriers, an unusual sight.The Islamic State has met little resistance. Thousands of U.S.-trained Iraqi soldiers fled when its Arab and foreign fighters swept through northern Iraq from eastern Syria in June.The collapse of the Iraqi army prompted Kurds and Shi'ite militias to step in, with limited success.The Sunni militants routed Kurds in their latest advance with tanks, artillery, mortars and vehicles seized from fleeing Iraqi troops, calling into question the Kurds' reputation as fearsome warriors.Iranian-trained Shi'ite militias may stand a better chance than the Kurds but they are accused of kidnapping and killing Sunnis, playing into the hands of the Islamic State, which also controls a large chunk of western Iraq.After hammering Kurdish forces last week, the militants are just 30 minutes' drive from Arbil, the Iraqi Kurdish capital, which until now has been spared the sectarian bloodshed that has scarred other parts of Iraq for a decade.The possibility of an attack on Arbil has prompted foreigners working for oil companies to leave the city and Kurds to stock up on AK-47 assault rifles at the arms bazaar.In their latest sweep through the north, the Sunni insurgents seized a fifth oil field, several more villages and the biggest dam in Iraq - which could give them the ability to flood cities or cut off water and power supplies - hoisting their black flags up along the way.After spending more than $2 trillion on its war in Iraq and losing thousands of soldiers, the United States must now find ways to tackle a group that is even more hardline than al-Qaeda and has threatened to march on Baghdad.

Things like ""this wouldn't have happened if so-and-so was healthy"" or ""he benefited from this event or this upset"" or simply ""he was lucky."" It's worse in some sports than others, but the overarching idea is always the same: it's how we impose reason on chaos. It's how we spend entire seasons or fortnights believing something, and then rationalize being so very wrong.Tennis is not immune to this, as every accomplishment can be framed in a ""well it could have been done bigger"" context. Given the astonishing dominance of the Big 4 of Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray on the men's side, a breakthrough isn't a breakthrough until someone collects one or two of those four scalps. Those four have been so good, for so long, that they've become something other than players.They're gatekeepers. You're not worth your salt until you've beaten one of them in a major tournament; you're not a top player until you've beaten one or more of them when the lights are brightest. All anyone can ever do is beat who's in front of him, but unless he does it in a fashion that is sufficiently star-studded, the asterisks fly.All of which makes Jo-Wilfried Tsonga's week all the more jaw-dropping. Outside of Nadal, every member of the Big 4 rolled into Toronto for the Rogers Cup at the start of this week, and every single one fell to Tsonga. The particular pleasure of watching this was not just watching a man put together a week of some of the best tennis of his life after a prolonged slump. Tennis players have vastly different approaches to the game. The very best players, the singular and memorable ones, have styles that can captured in a word or a phrase when they really red-line their games. Federer's footwork is so precise he looks like he glides. Nadal imbues his shots with so much spin that they seem to bite into the court. Djokovic covers his baseline with the inevitability of liquid mercury. Murray plays three-dimensional chess.Jo-Wilfried Tsonga plays a heavy, bruising brand of tennis. His serve is thudding, his groundstrokes torqued. Whether he's winning or not, the sheer weight of his game is apparent. But what's been missing for months is his grin, the endearing way he yells ""oh non!"" when he realizes he's made a mistake to lose a long point, the way he'll spend an entire rally hitting two-handed backhands only to coil up and hit a one-handed pass. What had been missing was the way he draws a crowd in by wearing his heart on his sleeve.Tsonga has always lived for the lights and, to the delight of anyone who watched, had an uncanny knack for manufacturing magic. But there were those who looked at him and wondered, at age 29, if he had any miracles left. This was the man who stormed to the 2008 Australian Open final as an unseeded player. This was the first man to come back from two sets to none down to defeat the mighty Federer in five, and do it on Wimbledon's hallowed turf. This man hadn't made a splash in a painfully long time. And, more poignantly, the smile had faded as Tsonga had spent much of 2013 battling a series of injuries set off by a freak accident during this very tournament two years ago.But after dismissing Djokovic and battling past Murray, finding himself up against Federer with the title on the line, Tsonga did more than win 7-5, 7-6. I could see in Federer's demeanor, in his body language, that he was frustrated. Roger Federer is the all time Grand Slam singles champion and the consensus best ever, and has earned an aura that can win him matches by itself. Time and again, while being outplayed, he's been able to keep fighting, keep competing, and wait for his opponent to falter.Today, he had no answer for the barrage, and so he waited and hoped Tsonga would blink.But Tsonga didn't, because he's one of the few players outside the Big 4 to have an aura of his own. An aura that his fans -- a group among which I count myself--had grown dejected waiting for. An aura that, in this match, muted even Federer's with its intensity.When Roger Federer strikes a forehand winner, you marvel at the fluidity of his form, the precision of his placement. When Jo-Wilfried Tsonga loads up and blasts an ace, you can almost see sparks. Federer is a king; Tsonga is a power surge.And at his best, Tsonga plays with what we saw in Toronto: a fierce, electric élan. And he reminded us, all of us, why we watch even when the Big 4 is so dominant. When tennis, for so long on the men's side, has felt like a formality until the Big 4 reach the semifinals, Tsonga has been one of the reasons to watch from the start. We watch to be reminded that talent and effort go hand in hand. We watch to be reminded that sometimes all you need to do is fight through the rain and wait for the lightning.And we watch because sometimes, someone like Jo-Willy shows us that you're never too old to catch fire."

When he asked for a tour of my house, I obligingly led him room to room.  ""Is this where we're gonna do it?"" he asked, eyebrows up, as I showed him the living room and its oversize sofas.I laughed the comment off, along with a flare of uneasiness. Till we hit the guest room: ""Is this where we're gonna do it?"" And the master. And the den. And the screened porch, the same question repeated with a leer at each doorway. I didn't know if he was kidding, had no social graces or suffered from Tourette's.I went through with the date solely because of our mutual friend, avoiding his grasping hand in the car trying to clutch mine (""Oh, you're weird about touching?"" he asked) and never so grateful to end an evening. When I later recounted the awful date to my friend, she waved it off. ""Oh, yeah... he has a weird sense of humor. You just have to look past that.""Um... what? Happily married and a long way from her dating days, my friend was quick to slough aside the offense I'd taken to the man's obnoxious behavior. Sure, I wanted to date -- and yes, maybe I was getting up there in years (and by that, I mean my early thirties), but when did women become encouraged to put aside their standards and accept so much less than we want? • A woman I know -- blonde and beautiful, smart, funny and successful -- was approached online with this arrogant note: ""I figured I'd see who in the world has the highest connection rating, and you're it! Drop me a line, and if you can get a smile out of me like your profile did, I might write back."" She wrote him.• A hardworking, intelligent friend dated a man who bragged about her talent at cleaning the oven and doing laundry rather than the fact that she was putting them both through school, then spoke in his native Farsi with friends even when she was with them, knowing she couldn't understand the conversation. She married him.• A boyfriend never showed up to meet my visiting brother and his wife when he promised to, and apologized -- by text message -- late that night, long after standing us up. We dated another year.These aren't the sexy, dangerous romance novel heroes so many women ache to reform, but merely unmannered boors.And yet too often, we date them anyway. After we spent so many years walking away from men who probably would have been excellent life partners -- because we decided they weren't ""the one"" -- what changes in us that we become willing to accept the bottom of the barrel?Here's what I think happens: Most of us are raised on fairytales and Hollywood (mostly the same thing). For years we believe that our perfect someone is out there, our singular soul mate -- and we wait for him (or her).As we date in the real world and we mature, we begin to realize that that perfect partner not only doesn't exist, but that maintaining the idea of him/her is a toxic sundae of over-expectation with a bitter-breakup cherry on top. When most of us go through at least moments when we don't even like ourselves, how can we expect to find in someone else that perfect puzzle piece who ""completes us"" (damn you, Jerry Maguire) and meets our every need and desire? And so eventually we learn to be realistic and healthy, and our desires change: We know that finding someone you like, respect, and love, and then walking the ups and downs with them is the holy grail of relationships. That's all -- just someone decent and kind who ""gets"" us and commits to sticking around even in the less-utopian parts of life. Seems like not so tall an order. But that's when we can dangerously overcorrect. Understanding the fallacy of the fairy tale, we become too accepting of major outrages, categorizing as human imperfections great, gaping character flaws -- to the point that we excuse what can only be called bad behavior.Seven years ago I went out on a date with a man who talked about himself all night, never once asking about me or even leaving enough air in his monologue for me to insert a comment. I sat, determined to give him a chance -- until a very generously endowed woman walked by, and my date's eyes riveted to her chest.It wasn't the ogling that bothered me -- those were among the biggest breasts I'd ever seen in captivity, and frankly I was hard-put not to check them out myself. It was what he did next: looked back at me, rolled his eyes and made a nasty scoffing noise.I immediately stood up, thanked him for drinks and walked out before we were even seated for dinner. My Southern soul was shaking at my unprecedented rudeness in walking out halfway through a date -- and yet I felt a lightness, a strange pride in myself for not excusing this man's mean-spiritedness.The next day -- literally -- I met the man who is now my husband.

Friedman of The New York Times sat down with President Barack Obama last week at the White House for a discussion on virtually every major international story that the United States is confronting at the moment. Jeffrey Goldberg of The Atlantic magazine did the same with Hillary Clinton--a former Obama political nemesis before turning into a trusted and well-liked Secretary of State in the Obama administration. After reading those two interviews consecutively, one can't avoid the large and noisy elephant in the room, in the form of a question: how on earth were Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama able to reconcile their views of the world, and America's role in it, for four years straight years? I ask this question not because the two don't like one another on a personal level; after all, during a joint appearance on 60 Minutes before Hillary left the administration, President Obama called Hillary ""a strong friend"" and ""one of the most important advisers"" that he had on a range of issues. Yet on matters of U.S. foreign policy, American global leadership, and American engagement in the world, the two interviews reveal stark differences of opinion. Different opinions between Obama and Clinton, of course, are unsurprising. They also happen to be healthy for an administration and a good way of avoiding the type of groupthink that has ruined other administrations in years' past. Indeed, one of the lasting virtues of President Obama's first term in office was the formation of a ""team of rivals,"" where a holdover from the Bush administration (Robert Gates), a blue-collar Democrat (Joseph Biden), a new and progressive president (Barack Obama) and an icon of the Democratic Party establishment (Hillary Clinton) were able to coalesce together, sit around the same table, and engage in some long, crucial, and at times tedious, debate on matters as serious as war and peace. Mark Wilson/Getty Images North AmericaWhat was surprising from reading the interviews, however, was how gaping those differences are. I was somewhat taken aback that Hillary Clinton was confident enough unmask herself to a journalist and make her views known in such black-and-white terms (Obama's politicos may very well view Hillary's interview with Goldberg as an attempt to kick a man while he's down. That man is Barack Obama, who's public approval ratings on foreign policy are below 40 percent). Either she was especially open-minded and honest that day, she got ahead of herself, or she knew exactly what she was doing while she was doing it. Given her personal desire to perhaps run for president for a second time--and her mission to solidify her reputation as one of America's leading stateswomen--I'm betting on the third option.Both Obama and Clinton spoke about a variety of international crises that are occurring in the world today, but Syria and the role of U.S. global leadership were two issues that were especially revealing to the extent that the two are coming from separate directions. Reading the quotes side by side, you may come to the same conclusion that I came to: Hillary Clinton is in the mold of the traditional American exceptionalist, whereas Barack Obama values his restraint as much as his action.On Syria, this is what President Obama had to say:""This idea that we could provide some light arms or even more sophisticated arms to what was essentially an opposition made up of former doctors, farmers, pharmacists and so forth, and that they were going to be able to battle not only a well-armed state but also a well-armed state backed by Russia, backed by Iran, a battle-hardened Hezbollah, that was never in the cards.""Compare this to Clinton's response on the same topic:""I know that the failure to help build up a credible fighting force of the people who were the originators of the protests against Assad--there were Islamists, there were secularists, there was everything in the middle--the failure to do that left a big vacuum, which the jihadists have now filled.""And this on U.S. global leadership:Obama: ""I'll give you an example of a lesson I had to learn that still has ramifications to this day. And that is our participation in the coalition that overthrew Qaddafi in Libya. I absolutely believed that it was the right thing to do. ... Had we not intervened, it's likely that Libya would be Syria. ... And so there would be more death, more disruption, more destruction. But what is also true is that I think we [and] our European partners underestimated the need to come in full force if you're going to do this. Then it's the day after Qaddafi is gone, when everybody is feeling good and everybody is holding up posters saying, 'Thank you, America.' At that moment, there has to be a much more aggressive effort to rebuild societies that didn't have any civic traditions. ... So that's a lesson that I now apply every time I ask the question, 'Should we intervene, militarily? Do we have an answer [for] the day after?""If Hillary Clinton finally decides to put her hat in the ring for the 2016 presidential race, she is going to keep repeating this message: America is indispensable, it's smart, it's savvy, it has unlimited potential and an innovative and entrepreneurial population, and it also happens to be the one country wealthy, powerful, and dynamic enough to stick its neck out to solve intractable problems that no one else is able or willing to solve. If you asked President Obama whether he would agree with this statement, he would most likely say yes, with a sole exception: the United States cannot come to the rescue of other people and resolve their problems for them. Republicans have come to rely on that passive sentiment over the past six years in order to put the Obama presidency down a notch. With Hillary Clinton as the Democratic frontrunner for 2016, that strategy is no longer one that the GOP can pursue in order to burnish its own foreign policy credentials and those of its candidates. Perhaps this is another reason why Republicans are hoping that Hillary decides to walk away and not bother with another grueling national campaign."

Rackstraw Downes 'Demolition and Excavation on the Site of the Equitable Life Assurance Society's New Tower at 7th Avenue and 52nd Street' 32 x 36 inches 1983 Oil on Canvas Here's a painting by Rackstraw Downes. I highly recommend going to see his paintings which are at the Betty Cuningham Gallery in New York and also recommend his writings, his most recent book Nature and Art Are Physical from Edgewise press has just come out. Rackstraw Downes 'THE COTTON CLUB FROM UNDER THE VIADUCT AT RIVERSIDE DRIVE AND ST. CLAIR PLACE' 34 x 66 1/4 inches2003 Oil on canvasRackstraw Downes gave the best visiting artist talk I had heard while I was at Yale, so I was excited to get him into my studio. While he was in my studio, I referred to painting as a language and he immediately and eloquently called me out, ""Painting is not a language, otherwise two different painters could paint a lemon and you wouldn't be able to tell them apart."" He was right, and over time I've given more thought and investigation into just why painting isn't a language and what its relation to language is. I've come to see that the primacy of painting is necessary to even be able to make claims about painting as language develops from painting both historically, for our cultures at large and developmentally, for us as individuals. Rackstraw Downes 'APPROACH TO THE HOLLAND TUNNEL WITH 75 VARICK' 35 1/4 x 60 1/4 inches 1989 Oil on canvas Why isn't painting a language? In order for something to be a language, it needs three things, syntax, pragmatics and semantics. Syntax is grammar, which painting only kind of has. There is a sort of grammar to painting, but for it to be properly considered grammar, the relation of its component parts would have to maintain a consistent relation to the painting's meaning, so painting fails as syntax. Pragmatics is the relation between the user and the system, which painting definitely has. Semantic meaning is the literal meaning of a linguistic expression. A single brush stroke or a splatter could be considered (and often is) painting, but it completely fails in terms of having semantic meaning. Thinking of painting as language can be useful to communicate about painting, but painting is not a language. Rackstraw Downes 'Delancey at Suffolk' 19 x 67 inches 2012 Oil on canvasLanguage develops out of painting both historically for cultures at large, and developmentally as individuals.  From Lascaux Historically speaking, the cave paintings in Lascaux and Altamira are about 20,000 years older than written language. These paintings are paintings in and of themselves and also a precursor to language, a necessity for language to develop from 'proto-writing' to 'true writing' which goes through stages from being a picture writing system to being a phonetic system, where graphemes have the kind of fixed uses and meanings to constitute language. Gilgamesh TabletDevelopmentally, across cultures, mark-making (which we all agree by now that we can call painting) is a way that we start to organize our sensorimotor experience while in our sensorimotor stage which gets us from birth to our use of language. Painting is something we need as an experience to be able to develop the use of language.So, next time you hear someone say that painting is dead, remember that they couldn't have said it without painting."

Looking above at recent temperature anomalies, the western US continues to show warmer than average temperatures; the eastern Pacific warm spot continues to prevent much rain from reaching California.The North Pole, which will have one of the smallest summer ice caps recorded this year, shows average temperatures but is surrounded by land areas experiencing much warmer than normal temperatures - not good news for our Arctic thermal shield of ice.

Meanwhile, a California utility is contracting for 1+ GWatts of solar projects, and another 20% of capacity in geothermal power. And California solar customers are saving an estimated $700-1000 annually on their energy bills via net metering, which encourages use during hours of lower demand. Globally, affordable off-grid solar products in developing countries are having two major effects in rural communities: 1) providing cheaper, cleaner sources of energy and 2) through the successful pay-as-you-go solar financing programs, creating credit score records that allow these communities to acquire further loans needed for economic improvement.

The windy upsurge is partly responsible for pushing global warming heat into the ocean, thus slowing the heating of air surface temperatures. Australian researchers found that the warming Atlantic is creating lower pressure at the surface than higher up, driving large air masses high. Ultimately, these speed the trade winds and amplify the California drought.Within 15-30 years other conditions will ease the trade winds, though - allowing the heat pushed into the ocean to rise, noted lead researcher Shayne McGregor.

They fail to account for subtleties in how different animal groups respond to the intensity of timber extraction, argues the published paper, based on a meta-analysis of 48 studies that evaluated the impact of selective logging on mammals, birds, amphibians, and invertebrates in tropical forests. Even selective logging can heavily degrade forests, such as this one in Malaysian Borneo, completely transforming them ecologically. Credit Rhett Butler at MongabayThe number of birds in forests generally increases with logging intensity as gaps open up habitats for species that thrive in disturbed habitats and grasslands. But mammals, amphibians, butterflies, dung beetles, and ants decline as more trees are removed from a forest.  This fringe leaf frog is particularly vulnerable to logging in Borneo forests. Credit Rhett Butler at Mongabay""We found that mammals and amphibians are the most sensitive groups to selective logging in terms of the rate of decline in species richness,"" the authors write.
