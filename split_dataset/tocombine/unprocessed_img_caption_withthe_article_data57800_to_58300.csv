Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is calling on Democrats, Republicans and Independents alike to unite against Donald Trump, who on Tuesday became the GOP's presumptive presidential nominee after winning the Indiana primary. ""Trump has built his campaign on racism, sexism and xenophobia,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""There's more enthusiasm for him among leaders of the KKK than leaders of the political party he now controls.""She also blasted Trump for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, attacking decorated veteran Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and issuing ""contradictory and nonsensical national security ideas.""She concluded: What happens next will test the character for all of us -- Republican, Democrat and Independent. It will determine whether we move forward as one nation or splinter at the hands of one man's narcissism and divisiveness. I know which side I'm on, and I’m going to fight my heart out to make sure Donald Trump’s toxic stew of hatred and insecurity never reaches the White House.Read the full Facebook post here.Warren is hardly alone. Members of the Republican Party took to social media on Tuesday night to blast Trump. Some even quit the GOP altogether.

1,BLACK VOICES,Afeni Shakur Showed The Power Of Black Motherhood,Zeba Blay,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/afeni-shakur-showed-the-power-of-black-motherhood_us_5728f122e4b0bc9cb044cccd,"Her legacy was bigger than her son, Tupac.",2016-05-04,Afeni Shakur at the tenth anniversary memorial of her son's death. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572a04e61300001a01380768.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Afeni Shakur, mother of the late rapper Tupac Shakur, passed away on Tuesday. Her death, at only the age of 69, has prompted an outpouring of grief and remembrance. Headlines about her death mostly reference her son: ""Afeni Shakur, Tupac's Mother, Dies At 69."" And across social media, people are sharing photos of Shakur with her son, or tributes using the song he wrote for her --""Dear Mama"" -- a song that has become synonymous with her, her battles with addiction and her son's admiration. It's undeniable that Tupac Shakur was the man that he was because of his mother. His artistry, his ideology, his activism and his genius were intrinsically linked to a woman who encouraged him from an early age to question everything, and to rail against white supremacy. But here's the thing: As we remember Afeni Shakur, we must remember that her legacy and impact went beyond her son. Afeni Shakur was an activist, a revolutionary, a philanthropist and a scholar. An active member of the Black Panther party in the 1960s and 1970s, she faced the scrutiny and surveillance of the CIA and FBI, was jailed under trumped up conspiracy and terrorist charges, and later successfully secured her freedom by representing herself in court. Shakur was also a community organizer, setting up the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation after her son's death to fund performing arts programs for disenfranchised children. Proceeds from unreleased material by her son also went towards the foundation. And in the the years following Tupac's death, Shakur continued to speak across the United States as an advocate for Civil Rights and reform in black communities. Afeni Shakur has stood as a kind of symbol of the stoic grace of black motherhood -- a mother who has had to remain strong and keep it together in the wake of her son's brutal murder. She exemplified that grace, the sort of grace that's mirrored in the mother's of Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice and so many other black mothers of sons who died violently. But the beauty of black motherhood, too, is that it can transcend that narrative of pain and sacrifice. What made Afeni Shakur amazing and memorable wasn't just her son, or his death, or her activism and philanthropy following his death. What made her memorable, powerful, and inspiring was her consistent, lifelong dedication to her community and her people. Tupac was just one of many amazing contributions that Afeni Shakur made to the world. She was more than just the ""mama"" in ""Dear Mama."" She was a shining example of the power of black womanhood as a whole. "

Photographer James Hopkirk, who's a huge Star Wars fan, cast his adorable 4-year-old son Harry as Darth Vader in the photo series below. In it, The small Sith Lord does everyday tasks in a way that's just sinisterly adorable. The project, called ""Little Lord Vader,"" was shared on Tumblr just ahead of Wednesday's ""Star Wars Day."" The small Darth Vader is seen doing anything from munching on a burger to changing diapers (probably with the use of The Force). The photos were shot over a few months, and Hopkirk told the Huffington Post that the 4-year-old was actually behind the concepts for some of the shots. ""Harry had lots of ideas,"" the London-based photographer said. ""And he insisted that we include his little brother Ted in the pictures."" Hopkirk told HuffPost in an e-mail that his son's love of Star Wars began just before the release of ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens"" last year. It didn't take much for the tot to get hooked.""I decided that, even though he's quite young, I couldn't deny Harry the chance to see a brand new 'Star Wars' movie on the big screen, so I had to quickly show him all the other films first,"" he explained. ""He was just completely in awe of them. I'm a massive fan myself, but I didn't need to do any selling -- he fell in love with them straight away.""Interestingly enough, Harry gravitated toward the notorious Sith Lord the most. ""He loves all the characters, but for some reason he went nuts over Darth Vader -- to be fair, he is pretty awesome. When we play together he always wants the Dark Side the triumph. Hopefully that's not a reason to be concerned,"" Hopkirk joked. After the dad bought his son a Darth Vader costume, he realized just how kickass Harry looked. Pretty soon, a photo series was born.So far, there are 15 photos in the series, but Hopkirk isn't done capturing the cutest villain in the galaxy yet and promises there's more to come. To see more of Little Lord Vader and his antics, head on over to Hopkirk's Tumblr page for the project here. "
3,POLITICS,"Mitch McConnell Will Still Block Merrick Garland's Nomination, Donald Trump Be Damned",Igor Bobic,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mitch-mcconnell-donald-trump-garland_us_572a01f1e4b016f3789433a8,The prospect of a more liberal Supreme Court nominee does not faze him.,2016-05-04,Mitch McConnell is sticking by his opposition to Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572a098a1300002900380779.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is continuing his no-holds-barred blockade of Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama's nominee to the Supreme Court, despite the risk that he may get a less palatable choice from presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump, a spokesman for McConnell confirmed Wednesday. The conservative wing of the party, angry with Trump's record and principles, is up in arms at GOP officials for coming around to the brash businessman. Some elected officials and party members on Tuesday made clear they would rather disown the GOP -- one even burned his registration card -- than vote for the real estate tycoon.Some conservatives are even urging the GOP to cut its losses and confirm Garland, a mostly middle-of-the-road U.S. court of appeals judge widely respected by members of both parties, rather than deal with a more liberal nominee if Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton trounces Trump in the fall.""Republicans must know that there is absolutely no chance that we will win the White House in 2016 now,"" Leon H. Wolf wrote on the conservative website RedState. ""They must also know that we are likely to lose the Senate as well. So the choices, essentially, are to confirm Garland and have another bite at the apple in a decade, or watch as President Clinton nominates someone who is radically more leftist and 10-15 years younger, and we are in no position to stop it.""Indeed, early presidential forecasts strongly favor Democrats. HuffPost Pollster’s polling average shows Trump losing to Clinton, 47 percent to 40 percent, in November. Trump would also be the least popular major party nominee in modern history.But the calculus hasn't changed for McConnell, who has kept his conference in line. ""While I'm glad to see Democrats concede that there won't be a Democrat in the White House next year, Republicans continue to believe that the American people should have a voice in this decision and the next president should make the nomination,"" said Don Stewart, a spokesman for McConnell.""Despite the White House coordinating with liberal groups and millions of dollars in special-interest ads, no Republican has moved from their principled position,"" he added.Indeed, a spokeswoman for New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte, a vulnerable moderate Republican up for re-election in November, on Wednesday confirmed the senator ""plans to support"" Trump in the general election. The risk for Republicans, of course, is that Clinton could use the same rationale of ""giving the people a voice"" once in office to select a liberal nominee to replace the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia -- and complete a tectonic shift of power on the court."
4,MEDIA,Donald Trump Boosts The National Enquirer As Likely Showdown With Hillary Clinton Looms,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-national-enquirer-hillary-clinton_us_572a08d1e4b0bc9cb0453a07,The presumptive Republican nominee has had the supermarket tabloid in his corner throughout the primary.,2016-05-04,"This election cycle, The National Enquirer has targeted Ted Cruz and Hillary Clinton, who is likely to face more dire headlines during the general election. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572a5b4413000029003808e7.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK -- Hillary Clinton should not be alive right now. In late September, the National Enquirer reported that Clinton was desperately sick, quoting sources who said “she’ll be dead in six months.”Clinton outlived the anonymous sources’ prognosis, but the likely Democratic presidential nominee can expect similarly dire headlines over the next six months, given the Enquirer’s record of attacking rivals of presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump.Trump on Wednesday praised the Enquirer, which had most recently linked Texas Sen. Ted Cruz’s father, Rafael, to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The national media ignored the bizarre JFK plot story for two weeks before Trump injected it into the news cycle Tuesday morning on Fox News, just as Indiana voters headed to the polls. And he kept defending the story, even after Cruz dropped out of the race.""All I did was refer to it,” Trump said on ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Wednesday. “I’m just referring to an article that appeared. It has nothing to do with me. The National Enquirer gave you John Edwards. It gave you O.J. Simpson. It gave you many, many things. I mean, you can’t knock the National Enquirer. It’s brought many things to light.""The Republican nominee’s fondness for the Enquirer makes sense, given the publication's kid-glove treatment of him this election cycle with stories such as, “Donald Trump: The Man Behind The Legend!”While the Enquirer only officially endorsed Trump in March, the tabloid's leanings have been on display throughout the Republican primary.“Homewrecker Carly Fiorina Lied About Druggie Daughter,” blared a September headline.“Bungling Surgeon Ben Carson Left Sponge In Patient’s Brain!” came weeks later. ‘Family Man’ Marco Rubio’s Love Child Stunner!” dropped in December. More recently, The Enquirer set its sights on Cruz, who emerged as Trump’s most serious rival. In late March, the Enquirer published unsubstantiated rumors that Cruz had affairs with five women. Some news outlets had previously looked into Cruz infidelity rumors, but found no evidence to support them.The National Enquirer was famously right about Edwards’ affair during the 2008 campaign, so political reporters are reluctant to ignore its probes into the private lives of public figures.Still, national media outlets are unlikely to cite the Enquirer’s reporting alone, given its history of publishing unsubstantiated rumors and paying sources for information. Most majors news organizations didn’t give the Enquirer’s Cruz infidelity story any oxygen until Cruz himself publicly denied the report.Trump’s cozy relationship with publication may flow from his longtime friendship with David Pecker, CEO of American Media Inc, parent company of the Enquirer and RadarOnline.In August, the New York Daily News reported that the Enquirer wasn’t going to dig deeply into Trump because of his relationship with Pecker. New York magazine noted Trump’s “alliance” with the Enquirer in October, and reported that the real estate mogul's campaign was behind the Enquirer's October story on Carson, who was then Trump's top rival. The Trump campaign at the time denied it was the source.Pecker, meanwhile, has been silent about his relationship with Trump. An American Media spokesman said Pecker was not available for an interview. The rise of Trump, who doesn’t subscribe to formal campaign conventions and has previously peddled bogus Barack Obama birther conspiracy theories, seems likely to boost the Enquirer's status in the political conversation. Trump has already hinted at targeting Clinton’s personal life in a general election campaign, presumably dredging up former President Bill Clinton's scandal with Monica Lewinsky in the 1990s. And he has surrounded himself, at times, with notorious Clinton antagonists, whose work has been promoted in the pages of the Enquirer.Trump had lunch Monday with Ed Klein, author of salacious books, including hard-to-believe conversations that supposedly took place between Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton. Klein claimed Hillary Clinton was in poor health in his book, ""Unlikeable: The Problem with Hillary,"" which was cited in the Enquirer's story giving the Democratic front-runner six months to live. Trump has also sought the advice of dirty trickster Roger Stone, co-author of ""The Clintons’ War on Women,"" published last year. Stone was the Enquirer's only on-the-record source for the report on Cruz’s supposed mistresses, though he denied being the main source for the infidelity details. Just days before the New Hampshire primary, The Enquirer reported that Jeb Bush snorted cocaine on the night his father won the presidency, a claim attributed to Stone's recent book on the Bush ""crime family.""CNN host Anderson Cooper, interviewing Clinton on Wednesday, noted Trump’s promotion of the Enquirer. “He’s brought up a lot of stuff about a lot of people that nobody could have predicted, Cooper said. “He was quoting from the National Enquirer just yesterday. He’s made references to your marriage, to your husband. Are you prepared?”Clinton burst into laughter. “Well, he’s not the first one Anderson,” she said. “If he wants to go back to the playbook of the 1990s, if he wants to follow in the footsteps of those who have tried to knock me down, and take me out of the political arena, I’m more than happy to have him do that,” she said.Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
5,POLITICS,Congressional Candidate Distances Himself From 'Atheist' Label,Nick Wing,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jamie-raskin-religion_us_572a135ee4b016f37894418c,His words show just how loaded the term still is today in politics.,2016-05-04,"Jamie Raskin is a ""humanist,"" but he says that doesn't necessarily mean he doesn't believe in God. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572a1602160000e90031d9ad.jpeg?cache=mbZXjj2HMf&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There are more than 500 members of Congress, and not a single one has publicly stated that he or she doesn't believe in God. Not subscribing to traditional religious beliefs remains such a third rail in American politics that a candidate has never before entered Congress as an avowed atheist.Last week, nonbelievers saw a potential secular savior in Maryland state Sen. Jamie Raskin (D), who won a heated primary and cleared a path to Congress in his deeply blue district. Raskin is a member of the American Humanist Association (AHA) -- a nonprofit that promotes the philosophy that people can be good without a God -- and was supported by the group’s Freethought Equality Fund political action committee.In a recent interview with the Washington Post, however, Raskin appeared to distance himself from the atheist label.From the Post:The only problem? Raskin is Jewish. “One hundred percent Jewish.” “Emphatically Jewish.” A member of the District’s Temple Sinai and a father of three children who had bar and bat mitzvahs, Raskin says he has never told anyone is he an atheist.Raskin went on to say he was a “humanist with a small ‘h,'"" which he reportedly considered to be a ""philosophical marker, not a religious one."" And while the Post notes that it would be entirely compatible for Raskin to not believe in God while identifying with both Judaism and humanism, the article reads as if Raskin had rejected the underlying beliefs that had earned him the support of the AHA.Last week, the Freethought Equality Fund proudly touted Raskin's electoral success and record as an advocate for the secular community as a sign that he could become the ""only open nontheist serving in the U.S. Congress."" Raskin's remarks surprised the PAC on Wednesday and led its leaders to meet with the senator to clarify.Roy Speckhardt, who serves as executive director of both the AHA and the Freethought Equality Fund, told HuffPost that the confusion was over the politically charged terms that often dominate the intersection of faith and civic life. He said Raskin reaffirmed that his views as a humanist were consistent with the AHA's. The group defines humanism as a ""progressive philosophy of life that, without theism and other supernatural beliefs, affirms our ability and responsibility to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity.""""He has not adopted other labels that our community uses, such as nontheist or atheist, because he prefers to talk about what he does believe versus what he doesn't,"" said Speckhardt. ""That level of detail about his personal belief system isn't something that he wants to be a campaign issue -- he doesn't want it to be a part of the electoral process for anybody.""Raskin's pushback on the ""atheist"" tag further underscores the delicate line politicians with nontraditional religious beliefs must walk in order to achieve mainstream acceptance.At its most basic definition, an ""atheist"" is simply someone who doesn't believe in the existence of deities. In the current political climate, however, the word has become a toxically loaded description, often associated with people who are overtly anti-theistic or anti-religious. A recent Pew survey found that atheism was the most significant political liability among a range of possible traits. More than 50 percent of respondents said they’d be less likely to vote for a presidential candidate who didn’t believe in God.And this distrust extends beyond politics, with polling regularly showing that many Americans have negative views toward atheists in general. This trend continues even as nearly one-quarter of Americans now place themselves in the broad category of religious “nones” -- those who are religiously unaffiliated or simply don’t believe in God.While Raskin may not consider himself an atheist, he did not explicitly tell the Post that he believed in a supernatural deity. If anything, Raskin made it clear that he doesn't want to discuss his faith (or lack thereof) in public. Raskin's campaign did not respond to a request for comment to further clarify his views.Alan Wolfe, director of Boston College’s Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life, suggested that Raskin was trying to counter the urge to put politicians into religious -- and in some cases non-religious -- boxes.""Do you know what Hubert Humphrey's religion was? Because I don't. It just wasn't a factor, it never got asked, and now it does all the time,"" he told HuffPost. ""I interpret what he's doing as resisting that whole trend, basically trying to say politely, 'It's none of your business.'""But regardless of Raskin's religious beliefs, Wolfe says he isn't surprised that politicians aren't rushing to take on the baggage associated with being an atheist.""Maybe in another world sometime it would be less controversial, but why call more attention to the issue?"" Wolfe said. ""Maybe after he's been there for 10 terms and he's in a safe district he could lead a national seminar on the whole question. The country would benefit from that."""
6,BUSINESS,A Huge Motherhood Challenge That Companies Are Finally Starting To Address,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/returning-to-work-after-raising-kids_us_5729fe63e4b0bc9cb0453148,"Hello, from the other side. Please hire me.",2016-05-04,Adele took time away from her career after her son Angelo was born in 2012.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572a13e6160000890331d99f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Somewhere I've failed or have been failed,” Jami Demuth, a 38-year-old mother of three in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, wrote last year, detailing her fruitless year-long search for a job.Demuth had spent seven years at home with the kids and didn’t realize how hard it would be to get back to work.“I know we sacrificed a lot so I could stay home with our children (something I would never change) but I did have brighter hopes for my future.” With a master’s degree in education and a track record working at a university, “I thought my degrees and past work experience would speak for themselves. I thought I'd seamlessly transition back into the work force.""She sent out 50 resumes, landed just three interviews and no jobs. Finally, after a year, Demuth's friend helped her get a position at a financial company, working in customer service for about $31,000 a year. “It’s kind of who you know,” Demuth told The Huffington Post recently.It’s hard to overstate how daunting a return to work can be for those who’ve stepped away. Like a new car that’s driven off the lot, your value seems to plummet instantly once you leave the security of full-time work for the chaos of parenting. You're also dealing with all the emotions involved in leaving full-time motherhood behind. Women are penalized harshly for taking time away to raise children. Career breaks lower your salary potential, reduce your retirement income. Indeed, they help contribute to the wage gap between men and women. Mothers typically make only 73 cents for every dollar paid to fathers, according to a new National Women’s Law Center analysis of U.S. census data. The gap is wider than the 21-cent difference between women and men overall.Knowing some of this can make the prospect of going back to work pretty scary. “Regardless of how successful they’ve been, across the board [returning mothers] all lack confidence,” Jennifer Gefsky told HuffPost recently. A lawyer who left a prestigious job to raise her kids in the suburbs of New York City, Gefsky knows the drill. And now she’s doing something to help other women get back to it.On Wednesday, Gefsky and Niccole Kroll, a registered dietian who also left her career for motherhood, launched Après, a website for women seeking to re-enter the workforce after time away. Fast Company has dubbed it the LinkedIn for women who’ve taken a career break.Gefsky notes that the website is open to men who are returning to work, as well. However, fathers are much less likely to take career breaks.The site features job listings targeted to women with “gap years” -- from full-time work, to part-time, consulting gigs and maternity leave fill-ins -- and also connects job hunters with career coaches.Après is also partnering with a diverse group of employers -- who will be featured on the site -- including The Carlyle Group, Sirius XM and Major League Baseball. The MLB “needs women,” Gefsky said.“There’s not a great message from Corporate America saying, we want you back,"" she said. ""It’s really hard. Unless you can pull on your personal networks. It’s too difficult.""Some companies though are starting to realize that there’s value in getting these women back to work. Chang Li, is a data scientist who lives with her husband and two children in Los Angeles. She took three years off from work to be with her kids, ages 3 and 10. That apparently was a millennium in the tech industry. “I got a lot of interviews. No full-time offers,” said Li who searched for full-time work for a year, while also taking refresher tech courses and networking. “You’re away from the work, especially the technical work. People might think your skills are outdated.”Finally, Li’s obsessive networking and research on re-entering the workforce landed her a break, more familiar to 20-something college graduates: an internship. She is one of six mid-career interns tech giant IBM brought on in April through a new partnership between the Society of Women Engineers and iRelaunch, a 9-year-old firm devoted to the project of returning those who’ve taken timeouts back into the workflow.The goal is to hire these women full time, Jennifer Howland, executive of the IBM Pathways Program for Experienced Technical Women, told HuffPost.To get the returnees up to speed quickly, IBM has been focused on training -- even doing a workshop with these women on millennial culture. Six other companies are involved in the intern program, including General Motors, Caterpillar, Intel and Booz Allen Hamilton. The program, the first of its kind in tech, is modeled somewhat on similar programs in the financial sector, which has been doing ""returnships"" for quite some time.Female engineers couldn't be more in-demand in tech, which is under the gun to hire more women -- and pretty desperate to hire tech talent.“It’s no secret that there’s a shortage of engineers,” said Kristen Siemen, a senior executive and engineer at General Motors who is working on the intern initiative. “We’ve been challenged with trying to fill positions. This was, we felt, a great opportunity to tap into a market we hadn't had access to in the past.” GM's program also started last month with women who've been out of work for anywhere from four to 21 years.Hiring managers are traditionally not so eager to hire those who've been away from the workforce, Karen Horting, executive director and CEO of the Society for Women Engineers, told HuffPost. But these women can make ideal employees.""You know they’ve been able to do the work, the risk is low,"" she said. ""It’s just helping them get back up to speed. But the principles are the same.""Jami Demuth, the mother from Iowa who struggled to find work, was up to speed pretty quickly at her new job. She got a raise after less than a year in the position. Yet, just last month she decided to quit. The job didn't have the kind of flexible hours she needed, and managing the day-to-day of her kids' schedules proved too challenging. ""My kids were having a hard time being by themselves after school. There was limited time that I could take off,"" she said.Her experience should serve as a reminder to the companies and services eager to get mothers back to work: They're going to need flexibility and support once they land there.By all accounts, the payoff will be worth it."

(AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Flint residents booed Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R) on Wednesday as he addressed a crowd at a local high school during a visit from President Barack Obama. The booing started as soon as the governor approached his lectern at the event, where Obama was scheduled to speak later. ""He was instantly and loudly booed by the entire crowd when his name was announced and as he came to the podium,"" Michael D. Shear of The New York Times wrote in a pool report. ""Let me begin by saying I understand why you are angry and frustrated,"" Snyder said, according to the pool report. ""I want to come here today to apologize.""The boos continued.Detroit Free Press reporter Regina Boone posted a video to Instagram showing the crowd continuing to jeer at the governor as he ended his remarks: Snyder-appointed emergency managers oversaw Flint switching its drinking water source to the Flint River in April 2014. The city had been purchasing water from Detroit for decades. Residents immediately complained that the new water smelled and tasted bad, but state officials insisted it was fine. Only after research showed rising lead levels in Flint children last fall did the city and state admit they'd caused a crisis. Snyder has apologized repeatedly. Democrats have continuously hammered Snyder for his handling of the water crisis. ""The state and their appointees caused the situation, and it's very concerning that we don't see the same sense of urgency or the same full-throttle support to get things done coming from the state,"" Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) told The Huffington Post earlier on Wednesday. ""Right now the state has the primary responsibility to fix the water pipes. They caused the problem.""Obama visited Flint to draw more attention to the city's water woes and recovery. Testing shows Flint's water is still unsafe, but Obama said people can drink from their taps as long as they use filters. Since 2014, the water has had high levels of lead that leached out of the city's aging water pipes. Snyder's government told Flint not to treat the water with chemicals designed to reduce pipe corrosion."

Do they really want a racist, woman-shaming, xenophobic purveyor of political violence to be their commander in chief?

In fact, Trump boosters expressed a broad variety of opinions about some of Trump’s more eyebrow-raising comments, with some in the long line outside of the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex explicitly denouncing some of the oddly complected magnate’s statements.“Any time you use the word ‘all,’ that’s a very wrong statement,” said Zach Tidmore, of Annville, Pennsylvania, when asked about Trump’s statements about Mexican immigrants and his desire to ban Muslims from the country. “You can’t use language like that. He should really change his wording around to a maybe small percentage, to put it in reality more than some of the stuff he has said. Some of the stuff he has said is very bad.”Many other Trump backers basically agreed with Trump, but also thought he should be a little more nuanced.“I’m not sure about that phrase — banning all Muslims. They’re not all bad,” said Raymond Wilt, of Hanover, Pennsylvania. “Go through the legal system. Let’s see if they are legally, honest Muslims.”Others sounded just as adamant and inflammatory as Trump, denouncing the same groups as he does, and accusing them of undermining America.“He don’t want the Muslims here, that’s fine with me. They kill our people. I don’t want them here either. I’m an American, I have a family, I don’t want them here. Let them stay in their own countries,” said Bob Getchey, of Shamokin, Pennsylvania, who was equally adamant about Mexican immigrants.He agreed with the substance of Trump's positions in just about every case, but he felt Trump’s reported words said less about Trump’s views, and more about the press.“I don’t think he hates women at all. I think the media causes all that,” Getchey said. “He gets the best-looking women. I don’t see how they hate him.”Part of supporters' embrace of Trump seems to come from an inability or unwillingness to hear the intent of critics with whom they disagree, especially the Black Lives Matter activists who are routinely escorted from Trump rallies. Trump acolytes simply don’t hear a plea to address historic and ongoing inequality and brutality affecting African Americans; they hear an assault against their own lives.Jeffrey Wright, of Souderton, Pennsylvania, understood that he would probably be called a racist if he launched a White Lives Matter movement, but he didn’t really see why the same should not be said of Black Lives Matter. His answer to the idea that Black Lives Matter activists were not interested in tearing down white Americans but in alleviating injustices, was to accuse them of using inflammatory methods.“Well, then they need to be educated in a proper way of how to say that, so that they don’t incite riots and violence and hatred and killing police and attacking police, which is what they do,” Wright said.Like Wright, other Trump backers saw racism as a bad thing, but didn’t see it in their own actions or Trump’s.Chris Burns, of Warrington, Pennsylvania, allowed that black Americans were not wrong to feel the way they do, but still agreed with Trump's most common answer to the protesters -- albeit Burns offered it with a much kinder, more understanding tone.“All lives do matter. Black lives matter, white lives matter. I think people matter,"" said Burns, who was wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with ""We The People Matter."" “That’s what makes our country great — that we live in a diverse, amazing country.”Much of the commentary on why Trump is succeeding focuses on his pull with white, lower-income voters in states like Pennsylvania and Indiana, where manufacturing jobs have been vanishing and wages have been stagnating for decades.Such people are especially primed to respond to demagogic appeals such as those of Trump, the reasoning goes, as they've been egged on for decades by the GOP.Indeed, Getchey grew increasingly fervent in praising Trump and blaming outsiders as he described what’s happened in his community of Shamokin, in central Pennsylvania’s fading coal region.“There are so many people without jobs where I come from. The coal is done. We only have one factory in a town of 19,000 people. We’re dying a slow death,” Getchey said. “For 20 years, the politicians didn’t do nothing to save our community. And we’re dying. He’s our only hope. If he can’t do it, America’s done.”Yet the other people in line appeared to come from all walks of life, and many had much more positive outlooks on life. Raymond Wilt said he’d recently returned from Orlando, Florida, where he has a second home. Burns said he’d been homeless a decade ago, but felt he was doing well managing a restaurant.Tidmore, a 21-year-old college student who was one of the few not wearing one of Trump’s “Make America Great” old-man golfer caps, was unreserved in his zeal for the nation.“I think America is a very great country.

He doesn’t take any crap from anyone,” said Zach Hurd, of East Berlin, Pennsylvania, a 21-year-old who wore American-flag-painted glasses but was at a loss to explain how his life was suffering.

And while such sentiments are more prevalent among Republicans, enough Democrats and independents exist who express authoritarian views that there's a path to victory for Trump, or someone like him, in a general election, despite what polls say at this stage.Perhaps what liberals should be most concerned about is not the comments that Trump voters make about race, foreigners and women, but the underlying reasons why they still like him, even when they think the liberals might be right."

Right now, the wastewater is injected into underground wells, held in containment ponds or impoundments on site, shipped to regular landfills, or spread on fields and roads.The Environmental Integrity Project, Natural Resources Defense Council, Earthworks, Responsible Drilling Alliance, San Juan Citizens Alliance, West Virginia Surface Owners’ Rights Organization, and the Center for Health, Environment and Justice have filed the suit. The groups initially threatened to sue on this issue last year.They cite concerns about the estimated 2 billion gallons of waste fluids that are injected into the ground per day. Recent research has linked wastewater injection sites to more earthquakes in some parts of the United States. They argue that many current methods of the waste disposal ""threaten public health and the environment.""The groups would like the EPA to regulate the issue under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, or RCRA, a 1976 law governing disposal of solid and hazardous wastes. Congress amended RCRA in 1980 to exempt ""drilling fluids, produced water, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil or natural gas"" until the EPA examined any potential adverse effects on human health and the environment and determined whether to issue regulations under the law's subtitle dealing with hazardous wastes, subtitle C.The EPA determined in 1988 that oil and gas wastes should be exempt from regulation under that subtitle. The groups say the EPA should still have to evaluate whether the waste merits regulation under another subtitle, D, that deals with nonhazardous waste.These organizations have been trying to get the EPA to at least review the regulations on fracking waste for years but ""never really received any traction on that,"" EIP senior attorney Adam Kron told The Huffington Post. ""As far was we can tell, EPA doesn't have any intent to revise these rules in the near future,"" he said. ""Putting aside the fact that it's been 30 years, the oil and gas industry is booming. We have so much more waste in the past five to 10 years. EPA has a legal requirement to do this, to review and revise the rules every three years under RCRA.""An EPA spokeswoman declined to comment, because the agency ""does not comment on pending litigation."""

But Indiana turned out to be the final nail in the coffin -- Trump won handily in the Hoosier State, including among social conservatives, a demographic that in theory favored Cruz.To reinvigorate his campaign, Cruz last week named former presidential candidate and Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina as his running mate, even though candidates typically do not name their running mate until they have amassed enough delegates for the nomination.His campaign also announced a plan to coordinate with the campaign of Ohio Gov. John Kasich, the other remaining candidate. Kasich's team agreed to pull resources out of Indiana and cede the race there to Cruz. However, this effort quickly backfired, when each candidate caused confusion by diminishing its importance. Kasich said voters in Indiana should still vote for him.Like many of the GOP candidates and party leaders, Cruz underestimated the strength of Trump's appeal. Initially, he often defended Trump instead of attacking him, strategizing that he could pick up Trump’s supporters if the businessman exited the race.But when it became apparent that Trump's populist and nationalist rhetoric was resonating with Republican voters, with the reality television star dominating the majority of the primaries, Cruz began to target Trump on the debate stage and on the campaign trail -- to little avail.Once positioned as a strong threat to become the Republican presidential nominee, the Texas senator was the first candidate in either party to officially declare his intent to run for the presidency in 2016. Bypassing the typical first step in a presidential campaign -- the exploratory committee -- he kicked off his campaign in March of 2015 with a rousing speech at Liberty University, the Christian university founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell.""What is the promise of America? The idea that -- the revolutionary idea that this country was founded upon, which is that our rights don’t come from man. They come from God Almighty,” he said in his announcement speech.A star of the tea party movement, Cruz made social conservatism and religious liberty a fundamental part of his pitch to voters. He highlighted his staunch opposition to gay marriage on the basis of religious freedom, particularly after the Supreme Court decision in June 2015 that legalized gay marriage nationwide. In response, Cruz said he would introduce a constitutional amendment to hold elections for Supreme Court justices. Over the summer, he held a religious freedom rally in the key state of Iowa, during which he proclaimed that “there is a war on faith in America today, in our lifetime” and bemoaned the “persecution” of Christians.But despite touting his conservative credentials and fashioning himself as an anti-establishment candidate, Cruz never quite managed to rally conservatives around him.The Texas senator was hugely unpopular among his colleagues, with most GOP lawmakers reluctant to endorse him until it became clear he was the only viable option to potentially halt Trump's momentum. Only then did Republicans begin backing him, though many gave tepid reasons for doing so and perceived him merely as the lesser of two evils when compared to Trump.Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) announced his support of Cruz just weeks after joking that he wanted to murder him.Former House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told students at Stanford University that Cruz was ""Lucifer in the flesh"" and ""a miserable son of a bitch.""Cruz's campaign never had the enthusiasm and fervor of Trump's insurgency. For example, when Cruz introduced himself at the second GOP debate in September, the audience responded with silence.And while Cruz portrayed himself as an outsider, most voters viewed him as an establishment candidate, compared to the brash, take-no-prisoners Trump. As the reality of Cruz's downfall and Trump's presumptive nomination begins to sink in, the Republican party faces a serious dilemma: whether to support Trump as the party's nominee and potentially hand Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton the presidency, or risk further damage to the party with Trump at the helm.Soon after Cruz's announcement Tuesday, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus urged his party to unite around Trump.But it's unclear if Cruz will now back him. He didn't mention Trump in his speech Tuesday night, and when pressed by NBC's Chuck Todd on Sunday, he repeatedly dodged the question.“Why can’t you answer the question of whether you can support Donald Trump or not?” Todd asked Cruz.“But Chuck, Chuck, Chuck,” Cruz interrupted. “Let me finish this point I’m making.”Ahead of the Indiana primary, Cruz continued to place his bets on a contested convention and tried to make the case that he was the best alternative to stop Trump. But in the end, no one could stop him.Also on HuffPost:"

As the reality of Cruz's downfall and Trump's presumptive nomination begins to sink in, the Republican party faces a serious dilemma: whether to support Trump as the party's nominee and potentially hand Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton the presidency, or risk further damage to the party with Trump at the helm.Soon after Cruz's announcement Tuesday, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus urged his party to unite around Trump.But it's unclear if Cruz will now back him. He didn't mention Trump in his speech Tuesday night, and when pressed by NBC's Chuck Todd on Sunday, he repeatedly dodged the question.“Why can’t you answer the question of whether you can support Donald Trump or not?” Todd asked Cruz.“But Chuck, Chuck, Chuck,” Cruz interrupted. “Let me finish this point I’m making.”Ahead of the Indiana primary, Cruz continued to place his bets on a contested convention and tried to make the case that he was the best alternative to stop Trump. But in the end, no one could stop him.Also on HuffPost:"

Pat McCrory (R) thinks his law banning transgender people from using the right bathrooms is unrelated to LGBT discrimination.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57291165160000e90031d833.jpeg?ops=crop_0_197_3000_1835%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory (R) said Tuesday that the sweeping anti-LGBT bill he signed into law, HB 2, was never about discriminating against people based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. It's about having the right to not feel insecure about yourself in bathrooms.“This had nothing to do with gay and lesbian,” McCrory said on the ""The Big Show With John Boy and Billy,"" a radio show in Charlotte. “It had to do with privacy.”The law, signed in March, is one of the most extreme in the nation when it comes to allowing discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. Among its provisions, it bars transgender people from using bathrooms that match their gender identity, and it prevents municipalities from passing LGBT anti-discrimination ordinances. Cities like Charlotte and Raleigh had such ordinances in place before HB 2. They are now invalid.The bathroom provision has gotten the most attention -- namely because of the public backlash it sparked among businesses and entertainers. The state has already lost millions of dollars in revenue from organizations that took their business elsewhere, and from performers like Bruce Springsteen who canceled concerts in protest. McCrory maintains it was necessary to pass the law because “there’s an expectation of privacy” when people use a restroom.“There’s an expectation that … the only other people in that room are going to be people of our own gender,” he said. “If there isn’t, it kind of makes you a little nervous.”In case it's not obvious, being transgender is not the same as being a sexual predator who lurks in public restrooms (there are plenty of cisgender men who've got that covered). Religious conservatives have been trying to make that connection for months, with some success, as part of a broader effort to chip away at LGBT rights after last year's Supreme Court ruling in favor of same-sex marriage.McCrory, who is up for reelection in November, pushed back on charges that he's a bigot, saying that ""that's the farthest thing I am."" He suggested cultural attitudes on LGBT issues are evolving too rapidly for him to keep up.""Society is changing quickly and anyone who gets in the way is in trouble,"" he said. ""I might be in trouble. I might be looking for a side job over here.""He also mocked Springsteen for canceling his show in Greensboro. He said he doubts The Boss even understands the law.""They only had 8,000 tickets sold, with all respect,"" McCrory said, laughing. ""Bruce doesn't mention that. They didn't quite get the ticket sales they wanted, that might have had something to do with it.""A request for comment from Springsteen's agent was not immediately returned.Listen to the full interview below. McCrory's comments about his law not being about LGBT people come right after the four-minute mark. The gratuitous criticisms of Springsteen begin just before the 12-minute mark."

Teachers calling in sick closed nearly all of the district's schools after learning they may not get paid because the school system is set to run out of money.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/586c021e1900002a000e2b97.jpeg?cache=0mmBzDr6eh&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"After two days of protests and empty classrooms, Detroit public school teachers returned to work Wednesday with new assurances from administration officials that they wouldn’t have their pay cut off — but the end to the conflict doesn’t resolve the district’s financial crisis or lingering concerns with leadership. Teachers were informed on the weekend that if the district runs out of cash in a few months ― as it’s on track to, without financial aid from the state ― they would not receive paychecks after June. Teachers have the option of spreading their pay throughout the year instead of just getting checks when school is in session; and as many choose the former they feared they would lose a chunk of their salary.In protest, over a thousand teachers called in sick to work Monday and Tuesday, closing 94 of 97 schools as they rallied at district headquarters. The “sickouts” ― a tactic that replaces striking, which is illegal ― drew criticism from Gov. Rick Snyder (R) and concern from the White House. But Tuesday evening, union leadership encouraged members to return to their classrooms because they had received “assurance” from the district’s state-appointed emergency manager that  teacher pay was safe.Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan (D) commended the resolution.“I appreciate the hard work and dedication displayed by Detroit Federation of Teachers leadership, Judge Rhodes, and the Governor to resolve this issue so our children can return to class [Wednesday] morning,” he said in a statement. Emma Howland-Bolton, a fifth-grade DPS teacher, was left frustrated that her colleagues’ other demand ― an audit to determine the cause of the district’s deficit ― was ignored. “Being paid for the work that we do is not a win. That is a legal right and an expectation,” she said. “Without the forensic audit ... we could very easily find ourselves in the same position in a week, or a month or six months.”And there is still no plan in place to fund the district after this year. The district’s projected year-end budget deficit is $320 million and its long-term debts total $3.5 billion, according to The New York Times. After sending nearly $49 million in emergency aid to DPS in March, Michigan’s legislature is considering controversial reforms that would direct up to $715 million to the district, cordon off its debt and create a new commission that would oversee school openings and closures in the city, including charter schools.The plan has many detractors, including a number of Republican legislators, charter school advocates, and teachers like Howland-Bolton who believe continued state oversight will not solve financial problems. Others, including Duggan and Snyder, believe the reforms and funding laid out in the bills passed by the state Senate are the only viable steps to save the school system.An alternate plan that advanced out of a state House committee Tuesday would allocate significantly less money, do away with the oversight committee and curb the union’s bargaining powers.The beleaguered district is facing a corruption probe from the feds, and students have some of the lowest achievement levels in the country. Enrollment has declined 71 percent since 2000 to about 46,000 kids. Two-thirds of its schools have closed in the last 15 years, while charter schools have opened at a rapid clip.Hazardous and unsafe conditions -- including rodent infestations, extreme temperatures and mold -- at school buildings prompted a wave of teacher sickouts earlier in the year. For many teachers, one of the biggest issues with the district is that it has been run by a series of state-appointed managers since 2009, leaving the elected school board powerless. Emergency managers have slashed the budget at the expense of students, they say, but the deficit has still ballooned.Current transition manager Steven Rhodes previously served as the judge in the city of Detroit’s bankruptcy trial; he replaced former DPS emergency manager Darnell Earley, who has been widely excoriated for his earlier role managing Flint, Michigan, as its lead poisoning crisis began.Joel Berger, a ninth-grade English teacher at Cass Technical High School, told The Huffington Post in an email that he and his colleagues protested this week because they “want democracy back”:State-run emergency managers have run the district into the ground and there have been no formal political channels by which teachers and parents could stop it because of Michigan's draconian emergency manager laws. We want our elected school board returned to power immediately. We are just sick of being used as political pawns and disrespected by politicians who don't seem to care about the education of our mostly Black and Latin@ students in Detroit. We are done allowing economic injustices, political injustices, and racial injustices to hurt our students, their families, and ourselves. It is time to bear witness. The injustices just need to stop.Parents had varying opinions about the sickouts, with some conflicted about a tactic that keeps their kids out of school. But some parents and students joined teachers’ protests:Howland-Bolton said one positive result of the protests was seeing the power she and union members have when they work together. The earlier sickouts were also effective, prompting mass building inspections and fixes. “I’m excited to go back to school -- what I want to do is teach. The place I want to be is with my students,” she added. “If we didn’t achieve our long-term goals, at least I’ll get to teach one more day.”"

In Central African Republic a quarter of schools are not functioning.In periods of crisis, parents cite education as one of their top priorities, yet last year only a fraction of children identified as needing education in humanitarian response plans were reached, UNICEF said.The new fund would disburse aid at the first sign of upheaval and provide longer term funding in protracted crises, UNICEF said in a report.When crises hit, children are often forced to move repeatedly, interrupting their schooling.In the poorest communities, UNICEF said a child who is out of school for more than a year is unlikely to return. Girls are 2.5 times more likely to drop out of school than boys.UNICEF said disruption to schooling also had huge implications for long-term development.""Education can be a driver of stability, reconciliation and peacebuilding, and a buffer against future social and economic shocks,"" the report said.""If education is not used as a lever to break the cycle, then crises will continue to be repeated.""UNICEF could not say if the number of children in crisis affected countries had increased as there were no comparable estimates for previous years.The fund will seek support from new donor countries, the commercial sector, foundations, philanthropists, diasporas and faith-based groups, as well as traditional donors.It will be launched by UNICEF with partners including the U.N. education envoy, the U.N. refugee agency and governments.(Editing by Katie Nguyen; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, which covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, corruption and climate change.

In Central African Republic a quarter of schools are not functioning.In periods of crisis, parents cite education as one of their top priorities, yet last year only a fraction of children identified as needing education in humanitarian response plans were reached, UNICEF said.The new fund would disburse aid at the first sign of upheaval and provide longer term funding in protracted crises, UNICEF said in a report.When crises hit, children are often forced to move repeatedly, interrupting their schooling.In the poorest communities, UNICEF said a child who is out of school for more than a year is unlikely to return. Girls are 2.5 times more likely to drop out of school than boys.UNICEF said disruption to schooling also had huge implications for long-term development.""Education can be a driver of stability, reconciliation and peacebuilding, and a buffer against future social and economic shocks,"" the report said.""If education is not used as a lever to break the cycle, then crises will continue to be repeated.""UNICEF could not say if the number of children in crisis affected countries had increased as there were no comparable estimates for previous years.The fund will seek support from new donor countries, the commercial sector, foundations, philanthropists, diasporas and faith-based groups, as well as traditional donors.It will be launched by UNICEF with partners including the U.N. education envoy, the U.N. refugee agency and governments.(Editing by Katie Nguyen; Please credit the Thomson Reuters Foundation, the charitable arm of Thomson Reuters, which covers humanitarian news, women's rights, trafficking, corruption and climate change.

25,WOMEN,Lupita Nyong’o Isn’t Here For What Society Says Women ‘Need To Do',Taylor Pittman,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lupita-nyongo-isnt-here-for-what-society-says-women-need-to-do_us_5728aa43e4b096e9f08f1534,"Why the star took on a ""small"" play, ""expectations be damned.""",2016-05-03,Lupita Nyong'o is over society's expectations of women.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5728acba1300002a0038051f.jpeg?cache=l2usQ8Bpbr&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Lupita Nyong'o knows what society expects her to do, but that doesn't mean she's going to do it. In an essay featured in Tuesday morning's edition of Lenny Letter, the star of the Broadway play, ""Eclipsed,"" wrote about how a journalist once asked why someone with her Hollywood status would decide to do ""such a small play."" For her, the question ""felt quite silly"" because the story of ""Eclipsed"" is far from ""small."" She wrote that the question exposed bigger societal expectations of women, especially women of color. ""I knew there was a sense of what was expected of me, but this play felt so important to me that I had to do it, expectations be damned,"" she wrote. ""I think as women, as women of color, as black women, too often we hear about what we 'need to do,'"" she wrote. ""How we need to behave, what we need to wear, what’s deemed as too much or not enough, the cultural politics of what society considers appropriate for us and for our lives.""Nyong'o, who is nominated for a Tony Award for her ""Eclipsed"" performance, wrote that she turned down projects in order to do the play because its message was so important to her. For inspiration, she looks to the careers of ""fearless actresses"" like Viola Davis and Tilda Swinton who ""approach every role without ego or vanity"" whether they're the star of the show or have a minor part. She also keeps in mind the damaging tropes about women of color that exist in Hollywood in an effort to combat them.""So often women of color are relegated to playing simple tropes: the sidekick, the best friend, the noble savage, or the clown,"" she wrote. ""We are confined to being a simple and symbolic peripheral character — one who doesn’t have her own journey or emotional landscape.""Nyong'o's decision to take on a project ultimately comes down to two vital questions. ""What I am learning is that the most important questions you can ask yourself are 'What do I want?' and 'Who do I want to become?'"" she wrote. And ""Eclipsed"" is exactly what Nyong'o wanted, ""a work of incredible power"" that is visible on stage and behind the scenes.""I look at this play — it’s the first play on Broadway to feature an all-woman cast, playwright, and director, and the fact that we are all women of African descent makes it even more incredible — and I feel profound gratitude to be a part of it,"" she wrote. In her essay, she applauded the many women involved in the play, including her co-stars. She also applauded herself for taking on the project, a decision she made all on her own. ""I am proud of my decision to take the time to sit with myself and not get caught up in what others want for me."""

The eighth-grader was carrying a BB gun that officers presumed was real. It wasn’t.Dedric was shot in the shoulder and leg exactly one year after Baltimore went up in smoke following the funeral of 25-year-old Freddie Gray, a black man who sustained a fatal spinal cord injury in police custody in April 2015. Dedric's shooting only pulled a small fraction of the protesters who rallied after Gray’s death, but Maryland state Sen. Anthony Muse (D) believes the response would have been stronger had the middle-schooler died.“There would have been those in the community that would simply see the gunning down of a kid with a ‘toy gun,’” Muse, who is pushing legislation to ban toy guns in the state, told the International Business Times. “This could have caused some to react without looking at specifics of the situation.”Last year, the Baltimore Police Department wasn’t prepared to handle the backlash. When residents took to the streets to peacefully express their frustration with the way they were treated by the city’s police force, locals say Baltimore’s officers greeted them with riot gear and unnecessary aggression. Once the unrest escalated — with fires cropping up around the city and people throwing items at officers — the department failed even further thanks to inadequate planning, unexpected changes in command roles and vague arrest policies.A number of formal and informal changes have been made in response to last April’s uprising and community feedback, according to T.J. Smith, director of media relations for the Baltimore Police Department.But considering the recent shooting of Dedric, what, exactly, has changed in the last year?The department says it has addressed some of residents' biggest concerns. Five hundred police officers are to be equipped with body cameras this week (though the department missed its May 1 deadline), with the rest to follow within about a year and a half. Top-level commanders have undergone FEMA’s Incident Command System training (many hadn’t prior to the unrest) to learn how to handle large-scale protests. ""We’ve had scenarios where we’ve had to put the new training to the test and we like to say arrests have been minimal because that’s the last thing we want to do,"" Smith told HuffPost. Six weeks after officers were charged in Gray’s death, crime rates rose and arrests dropped in West Baltimore, Gray’s neighborhood and the main site of the unrest. This caused some residents to accuse officers of intentionally slowing down their policing efforts.  The city police say they have seized over 400 illegal firearms this year, a 53 percent higher seizure rate than this time last year. And while the homicide clearance rate — or the percent of homicide cases closed — dropped to 30.5 percent in 2015 from 44.5 percent in 2014 and 50.2 percent in 2013, Smith noted that as of April, the clearance rate is double what it was at the same time last year.“That’s not indicative of officers taking a knee,” Smith said. The department will also have the first 100 days of training for new officers take place during foot patrols as opposed to in a police vehicle. This, according to Smith, shows how the department wants their officers to have a tighter relationship with the community.“It’s a cultural shift and mindset of how we’re asking our police to police,” Smith said. “This is a process and we’re working toward better relationships,” he added. “That’s going to take time.” Things are also changing in the office that investigates officer misconduct complaints and makes recommendations to the police commissioner. Kisha Brown, director of Baltimore’s Office of Civil Rights and Wage Enforcement, is supposed to receive within 48 hours all police complaints dealing with excessive force, abusive language, harassment, false arrest and false imprisonment.But, in 2015, Brown was informed of complaints anywhere between a few days up to a year after a resident had filed. Last year, Brown said the police department received 800 complaints but only 80 ended up on her desk. The police commissioner has within one year of learning about a complaint to discipline the officer before it’s too late to do anything -- even if the officer did something wrong.“As you can see, we have a long way to go in developing the processes that require and ensure that complaints made by the public are actually heard by the intended bodies,” Brown said. Brown’s office, which oversees the Civilian Review Board, is implementing a mediation program between officers and the people who have filed complaints against them. The parties will meet face to face in one of few opportunities for community members to sit down with cops. Participation in a mediation session will be voluntary, however. Kwame Rose, a prominent Baltimore activist, said Baltimore Police Commissioner Kevin Davis has made steps in the right direction by being open to criticism. But he said the city is still in need of a shift to true community policing.“They cannot police the city without input from the community,” he told HuffPost, noting that the interest in Baltimoreans' perspectives was recent.Brown echoed these sentiments. In January, she started having monthly meetings with Davis. She also meets with the police department’s chief of internal affairs to coordinate the receipt of complaints.More recently, Brown says she’s seen changes around how some complaints and incidents are handled, and thinks it shows that the department is listening to concerns related to officer conduct.“Civilian oversight in relation to the police is an issue that we haven’t even really begun to really get into,” Brown said. “[But it] is key to ensuring the accountability and transparency that the public wants.”"

He met her parents, whose story moved him deeply, he later said privately.In March, about four months after the president's visit, Jessica Grubb died. She was the victim of a medical error.""There was no message in her hospital record that she was a recovering addict so on discharge, the discharging physician -- who had not treated her -- gave her 50 Oxycontin pills,"" Clinton said.HuffPost's Sam Stein and Ryan Grim reported earlier:Like the opioid epidemic itself, Grubb’s death was complicated. With the president and countless strangers pulling for her, she was let down by a treatment system that resists evidence-based practices and by a medical community that still hasn’t figured out how to incorporate substance-use disorders into treatment mandates.Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), who served with her father David Grubb in the state Senate, has since introduced legislation he calls ""Jessie's Law,"" trying to make sure nobody else is accidentally prescribed opioid without a physician knowing about addiction history.Clinton called the opioid epidemic ""a problem we have made.""""Out of a desire to help people cope with pain, we have been much too open and easy in providing painkillers,"" she said.Her parents have since set up a memorial fund. Upon learning of her death, Obama wrote the Grubbs a personal note. Watch more of Clinton's remarks on the opioid crisis above."

It's one thing to have joined the #NeverTrump bandwagon during the Republican primary, when there were legitimate conservative alternatives. But with Donald Trump expected to win the Indiana primary Tuesday night, and amid increasing calls for party unity in advance of the general election, conservative editors, columnists and TV pundits who have railed against the real estate mogul for months will be forced to decide if never really means never -- especially if the alternative is Hillary Clinton. This week, former John McCain speechwriter Mark Salter and George Mason law professor David Bernstein went a step beyond #NeverTrump by saying they'd rather vote for Clinton. But it's more likely that prominent anti-Trump voices will adopt the #NeverHillary stance in order to rationalize supporting Trump, or that they'll end up backing neither the Republican nor the Democratic standard-bearer. This is a departure from recent election cycles. Both Arizona Sen. John McCain, in 2008, and Mitt Romney, in 2012, struggled to win over conservative writers and talkers during their respective primary fights. But when it came to the general election, the right's media apparatus largely fell in line, boosting the Republican candidates and bashing Barack Obama. Though Trump, as nominee, would surely have the support of already sympathetic voices like Fox News' Sean Hannity and Breitbart, he'd be unlikely to have the broad swath of conservative media in his corner -- that is, if the #NeverTrump crowd doesn't crack. ""Obviously, I’m not going to turn into a Hillary Clinton supporter,"" said Erick Erickson, an influential radio host, editor of the recently launched site, The Resurgent, and leading #NeverTrump voice.Erickson said he could spend all his time on air covering Clinton stories during the general election, presuming she beats Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, but indicated he wouldn't ignore the likely Republican nominee's missteps in a two-person race. ""Trump’s going to do dumb stuff on the campaign trail, and I’ll certainly talk about that as well,"" he said. Conservative hosts are ""obviously not going to be on board with Hillary Clinton and will spend a lot of time highlighting problems with her, but I don’t know if they’re going to actively lift a finger to help Donald Trump,"" he added. Erickson said he, for one, wouldn't. In May 2012, Romney met with dozens of conservative journalists and pundits after becoming the Republican party's presumptive nominee, in an effort to shore up his conservative media flank. Erickson doesn't believe a similar meeting between Trump and his ardent critics now would be as effective. ""I think the dynamic is different this time,"" Erickson said. ""Because by and large, it comes down more to a character thing than a policy thing with Trump for so many of his critics. ... I didn’t like McCain or Romney, and held my nose to vote for them, but didn’t doubt they were good people. The overwhelming criticism of Trump from the right is that he’s just not fit for office, regardless of policy positions. So I don’t know how you get people in the room and convince them that somehow you are fit for office.""Matt Lewis, a prominent conservative columnist, author and TV commentator, suggested he couldn't be swayed, either. ""I think that the real danger is Trump basically redefines what it means to be a conservative and he’ll turn the Republican party into a basically right-wing, white identity politics, populist, protectionist party,"" Lewis said. ""For me, I can’t do it.""Lewis said he'd respect a Trump critic's decision to support the nominee, but it would depend on their motivation during the primary. For instance, a pundit arguing Trump was a poor choice because of his policy positions could understandably come around if they believe Trump's now receiving better counsel or has modified his views. But Lewis said he'd take issue with a critic who argued Trump was a racist, demagogue and authoritarian and then suddenly began supporting him. ""That’s discordant and it ... leads people to at least question whether your principles are that strong and if this is not a matter of expediency,"" Lewis said. ""Its sort of a collaboration with your new conquerors."" (He likened such an abrupt change of heart to ""Simpsons"" newsman Kent Brockman welcoming his ""insect overlords"" after believing giant ants were headed toward Earth). Lewis noted that the priorities of the TV business could prompt some conservative commentators to eventually side with Trump. That's because cable bookers planning a one-on-one political slugfest may seek a Republican counterpart willing to give a full-throated defense of his or her party's nominee. ""If one person is drinking the Democratic Kool Aid and just likes Hillary Clinton to the hilt, and you’re like, ‘Well, Hillary’s not great, but I also think Donald Trump’s wrong about his protectionist policies,’ you’re not really representing the Republican side and it’s not going to be great TV,"" he said. Conservative radio host Charlie Sykes, who grilled Trump in the days leading up to his loss in the Wisconsin primary, said ""it’s going to be very, very difficult"" for conservative critics of Trump in the media. Still, Sykes isn't waffling, and on Tuesday morning, tweeted that he remains squarely in the #NeverTrump camp. “#NeverTrump means never, I mean, never in hell,"" he told HuffPost. ""Maybe we need to change it to #TrumpNFW.""Sykes said the challenge for conservative hosts is that they're going to have to critique the Democratic nominee, and yet ""a lot of the things the Democrats are going to say about Donald Trump are exactly the kind of things that we’ve been saying about Donald Trump.""Sykes said a Trump nomination may lead him to talk more in the coming months about downballot races, or he joked, the Green Bay Packers.However, Sykes said there's a liberating quality to being what he described as ""hard #NeverTrump"" versus the ""soft #NeverTrump"" conservative who could still be swayed to back him in the general election. ""I think that’s going to be brutal,"" he said of the latter. ""If you know who Donald Trump is and you have to carry water for the guy, what fresh hell. Whereas, I’m like, hey, I don't have a dog in this hunt, I’m an honest broker. I can tell you exactly what I think.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

(He likened such an abrupt change of heart to ""Simpsons"" newsman Kent Brockman welcoming his ""insect overlords"" after believing giant ants were headed toward Earth). Lewis noted that the priorities of the TV business could prompt some conservative commentators to eventually side with Trump. That's because cable bookers planning a one-on-one political slugfest may seek a Republican counterpart willing to give a full-throated defense of his or her party's nominee. ""If one person is drinking the Democratic Kool Aid and just likes Hillary Clinton to the hilt, and you’re like, ‘Well, Hillary’s not great, but I also think Donald Trump’s wrong about his protectionist policies,’ you’re not really representing the Republican side and it’s not going to be great TV,"" he said. Conservative radio host Charlie Sykes, who grilled Trump in the days leading up to his loss in the Wisconsin primary, said ""it’s going to be very, very difficult"" for conservative critics of Trump in the media. Still, Sykes isn't waffling, and on Tuesday morning, tweeted that he remains squarely in the #NeverTrump camp. “#NeverTrump means never, I mean, never in hell,"" he told HuffPost. ""Maybe we need to change it to #TrumpNFW.""Sykes said the challenge for conservative hosts is that they're going to have to critique the Democratic nominee, and yet ""a lot of the things the Democrats are going to say about Donald Trump are exactly the kind of things that we’ve been saying about Donald Trump.""Sykes said a Trump nomination may lead him to talk more in the coming months about downballot races, or he joked, the Green Bay Packers.However, Sykes said there's a liberating quality to being what he described as ""hard #NeverTrump"" versus the ""soft #NeverTrump"" conservative who could still be swayed to back him in the general election. ""I think that’s going to be brutal,"" he said of the latter. ""If you know who Donald Trump is and you have to carry water for the guy, what fresh hell. Whereas, I’m like, hey, I don't have a dog in this hunt, I’m an honest broker. I can tell you exactly what I think.""Editor's note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."
31,TECH,Can These Women Save Silicon Valley?,Shane Ferro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/can-these-women-save-silicon-valley_us_5728d7ece4b0bc9cb044b14e,Their new website is a how-to for building a diverse workforce.,2016-05-03,"The women of Project Include from left to right (top): Y-Vonne Hutchinson, Ellen Pao, Erica Joy Baker, Laura Gomez, bethany McKinney Blount, Tracy Chou and (front) Freada Kapor Klein with her dog, Dudley. Susan Wu, the group's eighth member, is not pictured.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/572913cb160000e90031d838.png?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In December of 2015, a group of women started to get together over dinners and coffees to talk about diversity in the tech industry.Over time, they formalized their ideas and on Tuesday launched Project Include, a website aimed at helping executives in the tech sector diversify their workforces. It's essentially a one-stop shop for solutions to the industry's diversity problem.Eight women, all with impressive tech-related day jobs, signed on to the project. The headline name is Ellen Pao, who has been, willingly or not, a public face of the fight against homogeneity in the tech industry in recent years. She sued the venture capital firm she worked for, Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers, for gender discrimination in 2012 and lost in a very public trial in 2015. She was also the CEO of Reddit for a brief period in 2014 and 2015, but resigned after the site's users initiated a harassment campaign against her.Some of Project Include's other members are senior Slack engineer Erica Joy Baker, engineer and startup advisor bethanye McKinney Blount and venture capitalist Freada Kapor Klein.Project Include encourages such teams to think critically about where their company could do better and to focus on the recommendations that apply to them. The site includes a set of 60 or so recommendations for how company management teams can approach diversity. These recommendations fall into seven categories: defining culture, implementing culture, employee lifecycle (which includes everything from hiring to compensation to promotions), training, resolving conflicts, measuring progress and leading as VCs. ""You can't keep shoving people into companies but not building a culture that helps them be successful,"" Baker told The Huffington Post. ""Our project focuses on all aspects of the diversity and inclusion issues that need to be addressed."" One major Silicon Valley venture capitalist, Chris Sacca, has already expressed interest publicly on Twitter.The site's information is based on a combination of the groups's own experiences and available research on how to best avoid things like bias in the workplace. Recommendations that appear on the website offer footnoted links to research supporting each point and include tips like ""define and share clear compensation bands"" and ""write inclusive job descriptions.""Inclusive job descriptions are important, the site notes, because they can communicate to applicants subtle information about who the ideal candidate is. For example, listing perks like ping-pong tables and game rooms give the implication that the target is young, white men. On the other hand, the site says that ""including 'salary negotiable' in a job description reduces the gender wage gap by 45 percent."" The goal is to help Silicon Valley better represent the rest of the country.""At this point there is rigorous research, and rigorous analytics, that point to increased profitability that comes from diversity [at a company],"" Kapor Klein told HuffPost.People often think of Silicon Valley as the closest approximation of a libertarian utopia. It doesn't matter if you graduated college or want to wear sweats to work: If you're smart and work hard, you can succeed.""If they really believe that, what is keeping them from acting on rigorous data that says they are shooting themselves in the foot?"" asked Kapor Klein, who says she would like to see companies get to a place where their workforces reflect the diversity of their customers. Baker goes even further than Kapor Klein in describing her goals for the project: ""There are a lot of companies whose customer bases aren’t very diverse. I would like to see companies reflect their environment,"" she told HuffPost.The women behind Project Include say they realize that the tech industry has a unique way of doing things, and it's important to think about diversity in a way that is congruent with the quick-paced, always adapting ethos of the industry.""We're doing it the way tech does, which is fast and accessible,"" said Pao.The website is minimalist and could be read in its entirety in a couple of hours. And in its simplicity, Project Include is also trying to be different.""You see tech companies now trying to do a lot of things that finance and banking companies did in the '90s,"" said Baker. ""If you don’t learn from history, you are doomed to repeat it.""There are two things that set this new push for diversity apart, says Kapor Klein.First, America is simply getting less white. That means a more diverse customer base, more diversity (hopefully) in the applicant pool and a relatively easier path to a diverse workforce.Second, there's been more psychology and management research about how bias works. We have a better understanding of how hidden biases affect everything from hiring to mentorship to promotion. And knowing about these things means being able to invent ways around them.In that way, Kapor Klein thinks tech can also be a big part of the diversity solution. "
