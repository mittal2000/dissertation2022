Affleck'll crush it. He's got the chops, he's got the chin -- just needs the material. Affleck & Cavill toe to toe -- I'm in.While it's unlikely Whedon's stance will change the opinions of many detractors, the director's superhero and action-movie legacies should count for at least a little something. Since helming ""Buffy,"" he has written and/or directed ""The Avengers,"" ""Alien Resurrection"" and TV's ""Firefly."" Whedon also created ABC's upcoming show ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" and is gearing up for another ""Avengers"" entry. Who better to sound off on this high-profile casting news than a lifelong comic-book fan?CORRECTION: An earlier version of this post stated incorrectly that Whedon directed ""Captain America,"" which was in fact directed by Joe Johnston."

The linebacker was chasing down Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson on a third-and-2 play on the first possession of an overtime game. Urlacher got him, but Wilson had already ran five yards for the first down. The Bears would lose the game and Urlacher to hamstring injury after that play. Needless to say this doesn't hold a candle to the way Ray Lewis went out.Urlacher spoke to Fox Sports, and he wanted to let Wilson know he's responsible for an Urlacher-less Bears this season.  ""Russell, I'm not sure if you know this or not, but you ended my career basically last year on that third down in overtime,"" he said. ""You were rolling out, I was trying to chase you. Trying to chase you down I popped my hamstring and missed the last four games of the season. You ended it.""It's true Urlacher's career ended on a Wilson play, but you can't blame him for it. He was just doing his job, and he has to watch his ass when a linebacker known for giving brutal hits is gunning for him.RELATED: The 10 Most Shocking Retirements in Sports History[via CBS Sports]"

But by day two or three it sinks in: I've got to do this every single day of the school year. That's about 270 school lunches for those of you who are counting. When it comes to dinner, I'm a firm believer in one meal -- chosen mostly for the grown ups -- for the whole family. Approaching dinner this way keeps us parents satisfied (children be damned) and goes a long way to encourage healthy eating in our kids. But lunchtime is different. While I'm totally comfortable sending my kids to bed without dinner if they don't like what I serve, I'm not so comfortable with them having to endure a long day of school on an empty stomach. This presents a challenge: packing healthy school lunches that I know my kid will eat without making 270 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches. The solution: be prepared with the right school lunch gear, keep a simple, but strategically stocked school lunch pantry, and get creative. (Or save your creativity for something more useful and borrow mine.)Getting creative with school lunch does not require a degree in fine arts. Sometimes, all it takes is changing up how you present staple ingredients that you know your kid will eat. My favorite quick tip is to ditch the sandwich bread. Sometimes that's as easy as skipping slices all together and opting for leftovers or a cheese and hummus plate. Other times, I like using novel ingredients, like waffles, in place of bread.  Even banans work! Pinwheels are always fun and what's easier than rolling ingredients like smoked salmon and cream cheese in a tortilla? (Nothing.)  And there's always sandwich sushi. Yes, seriously.

Perhaps if the list were compiled stateside, Miley Cyrus or Amanda Bynes would have made the cut. At any rate, here are the top 10 celebs who need to take a chill pill, according to Parrot Bay:1. Gordon Ramsay2. Katie Hopkins3. Lord Alan Sugar4. Helen Flanagan5. Justin Bieber6. Luis Suarez7. Kanye West8. Lady Gaga9. Bruce Willis10.Lana Del RayRamsay certainly has a lot to be stressed about. Earlier this year, there was the whole Amy's Baking Company debacle (although Ramsay came off as the even-keeled one), he was sued by former employees of one of his restaurants over unpaid wages, sued by his accountants and sued by a former contractor.Gordon, maybe take up yoga?"
