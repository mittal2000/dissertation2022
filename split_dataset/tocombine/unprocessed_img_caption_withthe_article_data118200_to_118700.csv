0,RELIGION,Turkey's ‘Rockin' Imam' Gets Green Light From Religious Authorities,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/turkey-rockin-imam_n_5489100.html,,2014-06-15,"TO GO WITH AFP STORY BY BURAK AKINCI Turkish imam and rock musician Ahmet Muhsin Tuzer poses with his guitar on April 27, 2013 in Kas. The imam from a tiny hamlet on Turkey's Mediterranean coast has run into trouble with the country's powerful religious authorities -- for his other life as a rock musician . The Diyanet, the state body in charge of the country's mosques, is looking to determine whether his form of music is compatible with Islam and whether his work as a musician conflicts with his role as imam, a government-funded post. The imam made headlines in August when he and his band Firock performed for the first time in public at a local festival in his hometown of Kas in front of a crowd of hundreds of curious onlookers. AFP PHOTO/STRINGER (Photo credit should read STR/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7e82c2600003600836fba.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ISTANBUL (RNS) Turkey’s religious authorities have given the go-ahead for the country’s controversial “Rockin’ Imam” to keep on rocking.Ahmet Muhsin Tuzer, a Muslim prayer leader from the coastal town of Kas, raised eyebrows last year after he formed the band FiRock and performed as its frontman.His case — as far as anyone can tell — is unprecedented. There have not been any — to date — public cases of Turkish imams forming rock bands.A YouTube video of the group’s first single, Mevlaya Gel (Come to God), received more than 50,000 hits since July.After a concert in August drew more than a thousand people in Kas, Turkey’s religious authority, which supervises the country’s more than 80,000 state-run mosques, opened an investigation to see if a rocking imam was espousing a brand of counterculture that violates Turkish religious values.Nine months later, after having reprimanded him for critical statements he’d made about the investigation, Tuzer’s bosses say the show can go on.The decision comes as the Islamist-rooted government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan — now in its 11th year of power — continues to impose a conservatve religious agenda.Erdogan has courted controversy for passing stringent rules on the sale of and advertising of alcohol, counseled women to marry and bear at least three children, likened legal abortion to a massacre and has even called for a ban on mixed-sex accommodations for university students.“If I make a mistake, they will definitely punish me,” Tuzer said. “But right now it’s OK and there’s no problem.”Tuzer had already garnered attention from his superiors when he wed his wife, Mara, an Orthodox Christian from Romania. She’s since converted to Sufi Islam, and the two have a teenage son.International attention on the clean-shaven, 43-year-old imam, whose strong singing voice once led the call to prayer in Istanbul’s historic Sultanahmet neighborhood, has been intense. In April, he traveled to New York and performed in Brooklyn as part of a larger ensemble.Tuzer and his bandmates who form FiRock — a psychedelic mixture of acid rock and Sufi-infused mystical lyrics — have their second major Turkish show planned next month in the nearby town of Finike.“It will be a very, very big concert. We are expecting at least 20,000 people,” he said. “We have many surprises for the people.”Tuzer said he plans to return to New York in October for an interfaith concert with Christian and Jewish musicians. He said he’s trying to carve out a new niche: Islamic rock that shows the tolerant side of his faith.“This decision is very historic,” he said. “It shows we are not radical Islam. This is peaceful Islam because, you know, I love all people.”"

The Colacho represents the devil who takes away the evil from the new born babies in the village as he jumps over them in this medieval religious custom. (AP Photo/Israel Lopez)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7e83425000036003a0920.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"CASTRILLO DE MURCIA, Spain (RNS) It’s been three years since Juan Jose Duenas jumped over dozens of babies to the cheers of thousands of spectators, but he remembers it as one of the high points of his life and considers it the fulfillment of a family legacy.Following in the footsteps of his father and his grandfather, Jose Duenas volunteered for the lead role in El Colacho, an unusual religious festival held annually in this small Spanish village on the Feast of Corpus Christi.“(It) reinforces your bond with the people,” he said.Even in a country famed for ostentatious spectacles like the running of the bulls in Pamplona and the tomato-throwing fest in Bunol, the baby-jumping element stands out and attracts a growing number of enthusiasts each year.Yet few of the thousands expected to flock here Thursday (June 19) for this year’s festivities know that El Colacho is not just a quaint tradition representing the triumph of good over evil and welcoming newborns into the world — it’s also the village’s best bet in its battle for survival.“These towns and villages around here have lots of history and religious festivals but few inhabitants,” said Angel Manso, an organizer of the event.In the early 20th century Castrillo de Murcia had almost 1,000 inhabitants, five religious orders and five bars. Today it has one religious order, one bar and fewer than 200 people living in its picturesque stone houses. There are virtually no youths left and locals are continuing to move to the cities.It’s a predicament shared by many small towns and villages in rural Spain, which has experienced radical rural flight.“Modernism is breaking down the way of life that leads to traditions like El Colacho,” lamented Manso.Though it might seem like a perfect publicity stunt, the festival was not invented for the benefit of outsiders. It dates back to 1620, the year it was first documented, and is believed to have pagan origins.“When I was a kid the entire village would bend on its knees during the ceremony and it would take place in complete silence,“ reminisced 74-year-old Amadeo Santamana.Other villagers agree much of the religious fervor that once surrounded the ritual is gone, but its key components are intact.The highlight remains when the eponymous Colacho — a man wearing a yellow mask, yellow jacket, tight black pants and carrying a whip in one hand and oversized castanets in the other — runs around the village jumping over an obstacle course of babies aged 1 or younger.The sight of a grown man dressed as a fiend leaping over the helpless babies might strike panic in the heart of some parents. But locals say the only injuries sustained in its history have been to Colachos who pulled hamstrings. Visitors like the ritual so much, the villagers said, that nowadays all the 70 or so baby participants each year are theirs.“Some are only a few days old and parents bring them right from hospital so they can be welcomed in this tradition,” said Manzo.Galloping over the toddlers demands a degree of physical ability. Jose Duenas practiced a few times by jumping over mattresses strewn with children of friends, but on the big day he found the high-flying act easier than expected.“It was simple,” said the one-time Colacho, who is a financial adviser by day. “The anxiety you feel has more to do with respecting the rituals and the liturgy rhythm than with the jumping itself.”He said he would gladly reprise the role but that tradition requires a different volunteer each year, which prevents squabbles over who gets the honor.Those who can’t be in Castrillo de Murcia on Corpus Christi to catch a glimpse of El Colacho need not worry: A small cottage industry has sprung up around the festival. A local museum sells outfits and videos of the event year-round.If nothing else, the festival has brought the village a little attention in a world indifferent to their suffering. For the old-timers who meet every day at the last remaining bar where they eat tapas, drink cerveza and chatter, it has proven a significant source of solace.“When people hear Castrillo de Murcia, what do they think?” asked Santamana, the septuagenarian veteran of dozens of festivals. “They think of El Colacho, of course!”"
2,ENTERTAINMENT,World Party on Tour: Long Live Rainbows and Revolutions,"Kristi York Wooten, ContributorMusic Journalist and Founder of SustenanceGroup.org, Focused o...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/world-party-on-tour-long_b_5495452.html,,2014-06-15,"double rainbow rainbow in rural setting, over field in autumn after heavy thunder storm",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb463522100002501c80187.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Karl Wallinger is sitting on the running board of his tour van and smoking a cigarette. He just finished World Party's sound check at the Variety Playhouse, and I'm showing him iPad photos of the double rainbow that lit up the Atlanta skyline - and inspired end-of-the-world speculations on Twitter -- the night before. ""It felt transcendent,"" I tell him. ""It must've been some kind of scientific phenomenon,"" he says.It's not the first time Wallinger has pondered crazy weather patterns and spirituality.We both remember the night in 1993 when World Party opened for 10,000 Maniacs in New York's Central Park. The sign atop the MONY building flashed a temperature of 99 degrees Fahrenheit just as the sun mercifully dipped behind the sugar maples along the fences at SummerStage. Then Wallinger settled into the Stones-y groove of ""Sooner or Later"" and sang ""Positivity, please won't you breathe on me?"" to a crowd of neo flower children, Natalie Merchant fanatics, and his former bandmate, Waterboys frontman Mike Scott. (""There he was, down in front with that hat on,"" Wallinger recalls with a laugh and a smirk.) A few days before the Central Park show, Scott had been featured in a New York Times story about his ties to Christian music. Looking back, one wonders if Wallinger's penchant for 20th-century mystics and philosophers (see Dion Fortune and Bertrand Russell) was as much a motivation for his split from the Waterboys as was his pursuit of a more soulful musical style with World Party. Here's a refresher: After scoring a worldwide hit with ""Ship of Fools"" (from 1986's Private Revolution), World Party's 1990 album Goodbye Jumbo offered modern rock's first post-Cold War statements on protecting the environment and fighting corporate greed, tempered by stanzas that reflected Wallinger's longing for equality and peace. Q Magazine named it the album of the year. In just twelve tracks of upbeat jangle and moody grooves, Wallinger painted a future for globalism in sentiments that remain relevant today. ""See the world in just one grain of sand,"" he sang on ""Put the Message in the Box,"" ""Take a closer look; don't let it slip right through your hands."" Save for a five-year hiatus after a brain aneurysm in 2001, not much has changed about Wallinger since our last interview in 1997, when World Party released ""It is Time"" from Egyptology : he's still adding thoughtful verses and singalong choruses to a catalog of music shaped by the cultural revolutions of his 1960s childhood. There may be no room for religion on his agenda, but if you listen closely to Wallinger's words of longing, you'll find plenty of grace beneath the conflict and cynicism, even if he hesitates to acknowledge it. (""I only thank God on every album's [liner notes], because that's what Prince does,"" he jokes.)Like the character who comes face-to-face with the divine in his song ""Is It Like Today"" (from 1993's Bang), Wallinger writes from a position of concern -- for society, nature, and the common good.  ""It's been cracking me up lately, because I'm realizing all my songs are about such depressing things, yet they're not really depressing,"" Wallinger says. ""I think the songs are right. They're on the case.""Evidently, the Atlanta audience agrees. Our voices join Wallinger's on every refrain -- from the opening number (""Waiting Such a Long, Long Time"") to the finale (""Way Down Now""). World Party's current touring configuration, including Wallinger on keyboard and acoustic guitar, David Duffy on violin and mandolin, and guitarist John Turnbull on electric guitar, makes generous rhythm without bass or drums. The performance displays a mastery of melody akin to that of the best post-Beatles traditionalists (think Jeff Lynne's tuneful voice and Tom Petty's rock riffs): the ballads (""She's the One;"" ""Love Street"") are refreshingly unsentimental and ""Vanity Fair"" and ""Is It Too Late"" are gritty in the right places. Three-part harmonies add sparkle to ""When the Rainbow Comes,"" Wallinger's signature paean to idealism and change.Before the show, when I asked him how that song, in particular, reflects his views, he repeated a line from its bridge: ""It's been such a long, long time since I could laugh at this world of mine.""""It's a question of whether [government and corporate leaders] want to be praised for creating a world which is making people happy and fulfilled,"" Wallinger told me. ""It sounds like a cliché or a stupid, saccharin idea. But it's not. There has to be optimism there, surely.""  Wallinger, Duffy and Turnbull on stage in Atlanta. Photo by Kristi York Wooten."

But the event became a battle between the tea party and its foes, as the far right aimed to make up for the beating they took in the state's May 20 primary election by removing contentiously elected delegates. Those delegates accused tea partiers of attempting to work the system to ensure a tea partier became the new state GOP chair.By Saturday, all 15 delegates from Bannock County were successfully unseated, while attempts to unseat delegates from Ada and Twin Falls counties were in the works. Rep. Raul Labrador (R-Idaho), the convention chairman, ended up bringing the meeting to an end before delegates could elect a new state party chair or vote on any party platform amendments, as they had set out to do. “This is as low as the party can go,” said Labrador, according to the AP. “We have hit bottom. I think the party has no choice but to go up from here.”The turmoil doesn't bode well for Labrador, who announced his intent to run for House majority leader last week. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (R-Va.) suffered a stunning primary loss and will step down from the leadership role. Labrador on Friday joined the race to succeed Cantor, saying he hopes to create ""a leadership team that can bring the Republican conference together"" as majority leader. Labrador has billed himself as the candidate who can facilitate unity between House leaders and the tea party, but he faces long odds against House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who started rounding up support among republicans last Wednesday.“There’s always been disagreement on platforms and things like that, but to go to the level they went to this time to disqualify people,” state Sen. Chuck Winder said of the Idaho state Republican convention, according to The Spokesman-Review. “People that have been around a long time don’t remember anything like this.” CORRECTION: Cantor was originally misidentified as a representative from South Carolina.

In the most thrilling finish yet at the 2014 World Cup, the Swiss stunned Ecuador with a goal in the final seconds of second-half stoppage time to secure a 2-1 win in their Group E match in Brasilia on Sunday. The teams seemed destined for a draw before Switzerland striker Haris Seferovic banged the winning goal past Ecuador goalkeeper Alexander Dominguez in the 93rd minute. The last-gasp score for Switzerland came just moments after Ecuador created its own goal-scoring chance at the other end of the field. With the match already into stoppage time, Ecuador advanced the ball deep into Switzerland territory. Antonio Valencia surged up the field for Ecuador as the match entered the third and final minute of allotted stoppage time and delivered a cross to teammate Michael Arroyo. The reserve forward met the ball inside the Swiss penalty area but seemed not to receive it cleanly, taking a touch too many and failing to even get off a shot. After taking the ball off Arroyo's feet, Switzerland's Valon Behrami jumped to his feet and ignited the counterattack that led to Seferovic's goal. (GIF via @FlyByKnite) Before Valencia's long, loping run upfield, the 2014 World Cup seemed just moments away from its first draw. Each team had scored a header from close range on either side of halftime. Ecuador grabbed the early lead in the 16th minute when Enner Valencia nodded the ball past Switzerland goalkeeper Diego Benaglio. In the 48th minute, Switzerland went level with a header from nearly the same spot from Admir Mehmedi. When the officials announced three minutes of stoppage times, those seemed likely to be the only scores of the contest. They were not. "

Some deployed gas canisters and one protester was doused with pepper spray, local television station Globo News showed.A spokesman said the military police were still compiling information on the protest and declined to comment otherwise.A similar sized march was held ahead of the Switzerland-Ecuador game in Brasilia on Sunday, but the peaceful demonstrators simply laid down their banners in front of a police cordon and dispersed when the game started.Protests against the World Cup have tapered off since Thursday, when police used stun grenades and tear gas against up to 600 masked protesters who were ripping up street signs and otherwise committing vandalism as they tried to reach Sao Paulo's Corinthians stadium on the tournament's opening day.At least six injuries were confirmed, including several foreign journalists.But anti-World Cup protests have never reached the size of the widespread demonstrations that rattled Brazil a year ago, when up to a million Brazilians at a time took to the streets to protest issues ranging from corruption to police violence.The tournament, now in its fourth day, has been much smoother than many expected and some days have been entirely protest-free.While many Brazilians believe the $11 billion spent to build stadiums in 12 host cities could have been better spent, most have resolved not to cause disruption as their country welcomes some 800,000 foreign visitors for the month-long event.

Nearly eight years since Messi scored as a substitute against Serbia and Montenegro in the 2006 World Cup, he struck again.

Four years after an ignominious early exit in South Africa, France started its 2014 World Cup campaign in Brazil with a decisive 3-0 win over Honduras. In a match that included a Honduras ejection and the use of goal-line technology, Karim Benzema emerged as the star for Les Bleus. The France striker was credited with a pair of goals and forced a third that was initially credited as an own goal by Honduras goalkeeper Noel Valladares. That score was confirmed by the use of goal-line technology, a system making its World Cup debut in Brazil. The match had become a rout by the final whistle but early on it was hotly contested, even violently contested. Just a day after Honduras coach Luis Suarez felt compelled to defend his team's aggressive style, midfielder Wilson Palacios sent a different message. After picking up a yellow card in the 28th minute by stomping on France's Paul Pogba, Palacios picked up his second yellow with another foul on Pogba in the penalty area in the 43rd minute. With Honduras down to 10 men, Benzema stepped to the spot and scored the opening goal of the match. (GIF via @FlyByKnite)Playing with a man advantage in the second half, France would add two goals for the final 3-0 score. Just minutes after halftime, Benzema ran onto a cross from Yohan Cabaye and banged a left-footed volley off the goalpost. The ball ricocheted back across the goal line but Valladares could not keep it out. The goal, confirmed by goal-line technology, was credited as an own goal. In the 72nd minute, Benzema produced another goal that clearly belonged to him, sending a right-footed shot into the roof of the net from a tight angle. Amid infighting and lackluster performances, France crashed out of the 2010 World Cup after two losses and a draw in the Group Stage. Striker Nicolas Anelka was famously sent home from South Africa during the competition after clashing with beleaguered coach Raymond Domenech. The situation deteriorated further after Anelka was exiled, with players refusing to train during an open practice session in Knysna.“We’ve gone through a rebuilding phase, because people still associate the team with Knysna and the way in which we exited the tournament last time,” France striker Olivier Giroud told FIFA.com. “The French public hasn’t forgotten what happened, and we’re going to show them that we can keep our flag flying high during the World Cup.”With the full three points from the opening match and +3 goal differential, France is atop Group E after its first match in 2014 with Group Stage matches remaining against Switzerland and Ecuador.

The United States ordered an aircraft carrier moved into the Gulf on Saturday, readying it in case Washington decides to pursue a military option after insurgents overran areas in the north and advanced on Baghdad.Thousands responded to a call by Iraq's most influential Shi'ite cleric to take up arms and defend the country against the insurgency, led by the Sunni militant Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).In a visit to the city of Samarra, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki vowed to rout the insurgents, whose onslaught has put the future of Iraq as a unitary state in question and raised the specter of sectarian conflict.The militant gains have alarmed Maliki's Shi'ite supporters in both Iran and the United States, which helped bring him to power after invading the country and toppling former Sunni dictator Saddam Hussein in 2003.Oil prices have jumped over fears of ISIL disrupting exports from OPEC member Iraq.But having encountered little resistance in majority Sunni areas, the militants have now come up against the army, which clawed back some towns and territory around Samarra on Saturday with the help of Shi'ite militia.""We have regained the initiative and will not stop at liberating Mosul from ISIL terrorists, but all other parts,"" said Major-General Qassim al-Moussawi, spokesman for the Iraqi military's commander-in-chief, pointing out areas the army had retaken on a map with a laser pen.Militants in control of Tikrit, 45 km (27 miles) north of Samarra, planted landmines and roadside bombs at the city's entrances, apparently anticipating a counter-attack by government forces. Residents said the militants deployed across the city and moved anti-aircraft guns and heavy artillery into position. Families began to flee north in the direction of Kirkuk, an oil-rich city which Kurdish forces occupied on Thursday after the Iraqi army fled. IRAQI ARMY COUNTER-ATTACKSSecurity sources said Iraqi troops attacked an ISIL formation in the town of al-Mutasim, 22 km (14 miles) southeast of Samarra, driving militants out into the surrounding desert on Saturday.The army also reasserted control over the small town of Ishaqi, southeast of Samarra, to secure a road that links the city to Baghdad and the cities of Tikrit and Mosul further north.Troops backed by the Shi'ite Asaib Ahl al-Haq militia helped retake the town of Muqdadiya northeast of Baghdad, and ISIL was dislodged from Dhuluiya after three hours of fighting with tribesmen, local police and residents, a tribal leader said.In Udhaim, 90 km (60 miles) north of Baghdad, Asaib and police fought militants who earlier occupied the local municipal building, an official there told Reuters, and they directed mortar fire at the government protection force of the Baiji oil refinery, Iraq's largest.Masked jihadists under the black flag of ISIL aim to revive a medieval caliphate that would span a fragmenting Iraq and Syria, redrawing borders set by European colonial powers a century ago and menacing neighbors like Iran and Turkey.Obama cautioned on Friday that any U.S. intervention must be accompanied by an Iraqi government effort to bridge divisions between Shi'ite and Sunni communities.The aircraft carrier USS George H.W. Bush, ordered moved into the Gulf on Saturday, was accompanied by a guided-missile cruiser and a guided-missile destroyer, the Pentagon said in a statement.""The order will provide the Commander-in-Chief additional flexibility, should military options be required to protect American lives, citizens and interests in Iraq,"" the Pentagon said.U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry called Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshyar Zebari on Saturday and expressed support for Iraq in its fight against insurgents, the Iraqi Foreign Ministry said in a statement. Kerry pledged $12 million and stressed that Iraq should assure its neighbors that the war is not sectarian, but against the insurgents, the statement said.Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, asked at a televised news conference whether Tehran could work with the United States to tackle ISIL, said: ""We can think about it if we see America starts confronting the terrorist groups in Iraq or elsewhere.""We all should practically and verbally confront terrorist groups,"" added Rouhani, a relative moderate who has presided over a thaw in Iran's long antagonistic relations with the West.A senior Iranian official told Reuters earlier this week that Tehran, which has strong leverage in Shi'ite-majority Iraq, may be ready to cooperate with Washington against ISIL rebels.The official said the idea of cooperating with the Americans was being mooted within the Tehran leadership. For now, according to Iranian media, Iran will send advisers and weaponry, although probably not troops, to boost Baghdad.U.S. officials said on Friday there had been no contact with Iran over the crisis in Iraq. Asked about Rouhani's comments on Saturday, a White House spokesman said he would have no further comment.Any initiative would follow a clear pattern of Iranian overtures since the 2001 al Qaeda attacks on U.S. targets, which led to quiet U.S.-Iranian collaboration in the overthrow of the Taliban in Afghanistan and formation of a successor government.The United States and Iran, adversaries since Iran's 1979 revolution toppled the U.S.-backed Shah, have long accused each other of meddling in the Gulf and beyond, and have not cooperated on regional security issues for more than a decade. MALIKI HERALDS FIGHT-BACKMilitants attacked the convoy of the custodian of the holy shrine in Samarra, while he was en route to Baghdad. Sheik Haider al-Yaqoobi was not harmed, but 10 of his guards were killed, a source in Samarra hospital said.Maliki traveled on Friday to Samarra, one of the cities targeted - though not seized - by ISIL fighters who now prevail in a string of Sunni cities and towns running south from Mosul.""Samarra will not be the last line of defense, but a gathering point and launchpad,"" he told military officers after Iraq's most influential Shi'ite cleric urged people to take up arms and defend the country against the insurgents.""Within the coming hours, all the volunteers will arrive to support the security forces in their war against the gangs of ISIL. This is the beginning of the end of them,"" Maliki, a Shi'ite Muslim, said in comments broadcast on Iraqi television.Maliki said the cabinet had granted him unlimited powers to confront insurgents. Last week, parliament failed to convene for a vote on declaring a state of emergency due to a boycott by most Sunni and Kurdish lawmakers.In Basra, Iraq's main city in the mainly Shi'ite far south, hundreds volunteered to join the battle against ISIL, heeding a call to arms by Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, who commands unswerving loyalty from most Iraqi Shi'ites.The volunteers, of all ages, were due to be given weapons and sent to a security center in Basra later on Saturday ready to be transferred further north. ""We the people of Basra obeyed our instructions to defend our country from south to north,"" said 63-year-old Kadhem Jassim.Iran's Rouhani said he would review any request for help submitted by Maliki, although none had been received yet. ""We are ready to help in the framework of international regulations and laws,"" he said.
