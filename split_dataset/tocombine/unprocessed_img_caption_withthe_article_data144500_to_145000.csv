0,ENVIRONMENT,Island Nations Lead Where All Must Follow in a Looming Climate Crisis,"Kelly Rigg, Contributor
Campaign consultant",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/island-nations-lead-where_us_5bb141b8e4b09bbe9a5d58e9,"Whether the people of the Marshall Islands and many other Small Island States will ultimately be forced by climate change to leave their homes in search of higher and safer ground, depends largely on the actions we take -- the decisions that governments make -- in the next few years.",2013-09-02,2013-09-02-MarshallIslandsccKellyRiggtcktcktck.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-09-02-MarshallIslandsccKellyRiggtcktcktck.jpg,"For the 16 nations that are member to the Pacific Islands Forum (PIF), climate change is not a hypothetical problem, but a looming crisis. Their Heads of State are gathering this week in Majuro, the capital of the Marshall Islands, to adopt the Majuro Declaration for Climate Leadership.If they succeed in getting an ambitious agreement, they will help inject a much-needed sense of urgency into the UN climate negotiations. This is by no means a done deal given that two industrialized countries -- Australia and New Zealand -- are members. Majuro Atoll on the front lines of climate change, Creative Commons: Kelly Rigg, 2013The Forum is being hosted by the Marshall Islands, a country whose people have already faced down an existential threat emanating from beyond its borders. U.S. nuclear tests on Bikini Atoll in the 1940's and 50's left a devastating legacy of cancer and contamination. In 1985, the people of Rongelap Island in the northern part of the country went so far as to seek the help of Greenpeace to relocate them to a new home free from radioactive contamination. Whether the people of the Marshall Islands and many other Small Island States will ultimately be forced by climate change to leave their homes in search of higher and safer ground, depends largely on the actions we take -- the decisions that governments make -- in the next few years.I was therefore honored to be invited to participate on an experts panel immediately preceding the Forum, speaking about public mobilization and how to spark a new wave of political momentum for an ambitious global agreement in 2015. And while the concept of political momentum may sound like an oxymoron to those familiar with international climate discussions, there is actually much new momentum to speak of outside of the political arena. The science underpinning human-caused climate change grows more robust by the day, public opinion is galvanising in the wake of terrible extreme weather events, people are mobilizing against coal, tar sands and other high carbon infrastructure, and, as we are seeing with the exploding market for renewables, the economics are rapidly shifting in favour of clean energy over fossil fuels. But a new wave of political momentum is still sorely needed, and I sincerely hope that the Majuro Declaration can help do the trick. Progress at the United Nations climate negotiations has been slow and incremental despite the very real environmental, social and economic impacts already being experienced in many countries. And the upcoming fifth assessment report of the IPCC will paint a grim picture of the impacts these countries will face, including but not limited to sea level rise, in the coming decades.The world has already warmed 0.8° C from pre-industrial levels, enough to trigger sea level rise by as much as one meter by the end of this century. This is a given. And it translates to economic losses in the $60 billion range per year by 2050 as flood surges inundate coastal cities. Given that more than a billion people live in low-lying coastal areas, just imagine what will happen as temperatures, and sea level, continue to rise. And while the economic cost is high and growing for the U.S., China, India (and other countries with cities in the top 20 under threat from sea level rise) the costs to society go far beyond money. For small countries such as Kiribati, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and many others, the rising tide may wash away the only homes their people have ever known. This is the backdrop for the discussions that will take place at the Forum over the next few days. The Majuro Declaration is expected to recognize the complete insufficiency of current efforts to address climate change, and the responsibility of all to act urgently to phase-down greenhouse gas pollution. It will recognize that the Pacific Islands as a region already have ambitious plans to transition away from fossil fuels and will call on others to follow their lead. Though the sum total of their emissions reductions will be small relative to the pollution output of giant economies like the United States, China and India, they are symbolically very powerful. The spirit of the agreement is to reframe the ""I won't move till you move first"" stance many world governments continue to hold, to one of ""I'm moving and I invite you to move with me."" Its authors have described the declaration as the Pacific's gift to the world. Let's stand with them and accept their gift with open arms. And then let the rest of the world reciprocate in kind."

4,CULTURE & ARTS,"Meet Julia Margaret Cameron, The Victorian Queen Of Contemporary Photography",Priscilla Frank,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/julia-margaret-cameron_us_5bb2652ee4b0171db69fd04f,"Philip Stanhope Worsley Alfred Lord Tennyson Cameron was 48 years old when she obtained her first camera, given to her as",2013-09-02,2013-08-28-11._KingLearAlottingHisKingdomtoHisThreeDaughters.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-08-28-11._KingLearAlottingHisKingdomtoHisThreeDaughters.jpg,"Jonathon Keats called her the ""Godmother Of Instagram,"" Walter Robinson dubbed her the ""Cindy Sherman of the Victorian Era."" Yes, the 19th century British photographer sure had a knack for contemporary photography trends. PomonaCameron was 48 years old when she obtained her first camera, given to her as a gift by her daughter and son-in-law. ""From the first moment I handled my lens with a tender ardour,"" she wrote upon receiving it, ""and it has become to me as a living thing, with voice and memory and creative vigour."" Cameron was religious, well-read and a bit eccentric, having friends in the Victorian poetry and science circles like Alfred Lord Tennyson and Sir John Herschel. These accomplished compatriots soon became Cameron's favorite subjects.  King Lear Alotting His Kingdom to His Three Daughters ""I began with no knowledge of the art,"" Cameron wrote. ""I did not know where to place my dark box, how to focus my sitter, and my first picture I effaced to my consternation by rubbing my hand over the filmy side of the glass.""Unfortunately, art critics at the time were not too fond of Cameron's portraits. ""In these pictures all that is good about photography has been neglected, and the shortcomings of the art are prominently exhibited,"" The Photographic Journal printed in 1864. ""We are sorry to have to speak thus severely on the works of a lady, but we feel compelled to do so in the interest of the art.""  SapphoCameron reveled in the failures of her instruments, preferring to harness the spirit of her subject rather than a direct copy of their image. Her feathery, Pre-Raphaelite photographs float away from reality in their breathy visual interpretations. ""Time does not freeze in such a photograph. It melts and steams,"" Anthony Lane wrote in The New Yorker.Today we see this love of photography's flaws everywhere, particularly in photography filters like Hipstamatic and Instagram that distort exact digital replications. These contemporary techniques reveal a similar privileging of mood and essence over mimetic imagery. A Study As Robinson points out, Cameron predates post-modern photo goddess Cindy Sherman in her realization of the theatrics of the medium. In her photographs, Cameron acted out scenes from mythology, the Bible and Shakespeare, even creating an entire series based off Tennyson's poetry. Yet Cameron diverges from Sherman in tone, lacking any sort of irony or critique in her visions.Somewhere between the styles of F. Holland Day and Francesca Woodman, Cameron's soft-edged, spiritual portraits show that images can look ephemeral while proving immortal.

Warren Air Force.While driving to Cheyenne in the spring of 2011, he and his partner, Jerret Henderson, took a detour to Sidney, Iowa -- a small town near the border of Nebraska with a population of about 1,300.The two were already domestic partners under California law. But they wanted an official declaration in a state that allowed same-sex marriage.""We had always planned to get married,"" Daniel said. ""We just wanted the documentation, because the closest thing to marriage at the time in California was domestic partnerships, and we just wanted to be married, married.""But their marriage license was largely symbolic n at least in the eyes of the military at the time.Before a change was announced last month, spouses of same-sex couples were not eligible for the numerous benefits that the military offers.For Daniel and Jerret, this meant forgoing more than $29,000 worth of medical, housing and other benefits that they would have received if they were man and wife.""The benefits are huge, and it's a huge part of their pay and compensation,"" Jerret said. ""I don't know of another career field where if you're married, your pay increases.""But like thousands of other same-sex couples, Daniel and Jerret will be able to enroll in the spousal benefits starting Tuesday.The U.S. Supreme Court's decision in June to strike down the Defense of Marriage Act allowed the military to begin offering the full spousal benefits to gay married personnel for the first time.""The Department of Defense remains committed to ensuring that all men and women who serve our country and their families are treated fairly and equally,"" Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel wrote in an Aug. 13 memo announcing the change. ""Expeditious implementation of the decisions announced in this memorandum will help the department remain true to that commitment.""Having the benefits will be a life-altering change for Daniel and Jarrett. But the couple said it remains too little, too late.""It will be bittersweet, but for me, I'll still be sad,"" Jerret said. ""I'll probably cry, and not tears of joy, because we have been going through this fight for so long that it has just been exhausting.""Daniel is a member of the 90th Security Forces Group, which guards the base and its 150 nuclear-tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles.Hoping to become a police officer but too young to enroll in the police academy, he enlisted with the Air Force and set out for basic training in November of 2010.Daniel and Jarrett were already together, and the military's ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" rule had yet to be repealed.But the two did little to conceal their relationship.""Because of his career field n I mean he guards nuclear weapons n I assume there is some kind of in-depth background checks,"" Jerret said. ""So they were aware of our marriage, but they looked the other way.""The couple said they expected to face challenges and discrimination because of the openness of their relationship. But they were still surprised and disappointed by how other airmen and the military establishment treated them.Daniel said he was the victim of homophobic slurs, and the couple received multiple hateful voicemails.And the two quickly realized their marriage would not be treated anything like opposite-sex couples on the base.""People would ask what it is like to be a same-sex spouse, and I would compare it to being a woman in Saudi Arabia,"" Jerret said. ""And I know that sounds extreme, but I can't get on base without him, I can't buy a stick of gum on base without him.""And one time I needed to go the bathroom, so he went ahead, and I was stopped and asked for a military ID. Since I didn't have one, it was like I was being read the riot act.""The Air Force additionally refused to give them a housing allowance, which is given to other married couples who wish to live off-base.And since Jerret was not covered under Daniel's military health insurance plan, he had to pay thousands in out-of-pocket health-care expenses.Dismayed by their treatment, Daniel and Jerret decided to join a legal effort seeking equal recognition, benefits and family support for gay military personnel.On Oct. 27, 2011, they were named among the plaintiffs in the OutServe-Servicemembers Legal Defense Network's federal lawsuit against U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, then-Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta and Secretary of Veterans Affairs Eric Shinseki.Daniel is the only enlisted member who is part of the lawsuit. The other seven service members are officers.Daniel said this gave him a much different perspective than those in the leadership roles, who he said were treated better.""I would see the other members of lawsuit on CNN or MSNBC and all these big-time things, and the way they portrayed their experience was always contradictory to ours,"" he said.Most of their grievances in the lawsuit will be addressed by the military's new policy honoring benefits to same-sex couples.But Daniel and Jerret said they will continue to fight because the VA has not yet changed its policy to allow same-sex spouses to be eligible for veterans benefits. (Though a judge ruled in federal court Thursday that a lesbian veteran and her spouse should be entitled to disability benefits, given the recent Supreme Court ruling that struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act.)""And that's a shame because this is the heartland and this is Wyoming,"" Jerret said. ""People love their trucks, their Bible, their guns, America, and they really respect soldiers.""But when you have someone who is a combat veteran or who has served their country, to not take care of their family, that is unpatriotic.""Additionally, they are seeking the money they would have received if the military honored their marriage in the first place. Daniel and Jerret said they have itemized those missed benefits and the total amount is $29,300.Jerret said he is looking for something else too: an apology.""I really want that public apology, I really do,"" he said. ""It is something that is important to me, more than any kind of retroactive benefits or getting that $29,000 back. I think we deserve it.""Daniel and Jerret have a lot to talk about before Daniel's enlistment ends in a little more than three years.Jerret said he is literally counting down the days until Daniel is able to leave the service.""Nov. 29, 2016. I know the exact date,"" he said. ""It's like a countdown, I'm not kidding.""Daniel, however, has not made up his mind. And his attitude toward the military is more conflicted.""It has been so stressful,"" he said. ""But I enjoy what I do, and I honestly have a passion for it.""Daniel said military culture toward gay service members is obviously changing for the better. But he said homophobia still exists among some, and it likely always will, to some degree.And by the time his enlistment is up in 2016, Daniel said he expects the military and the rest of the country will continue to change.""Oh yes, I do believe that,"" he said. ""And I will be happy to know that I helped out in some way."" ___(c)2013 Wyoming Tribune-Eagle (Cheyenne, Wyo.)Visit Wyoming Tribune-Eagle (Cheyenne, Wyo.) at www.wyomingnews.comDistributed by MCT Information Services"

While the past decade’s painful recession and the slow job growth that has followed have negatively affected most Americans, certain occupations have experienced job losses that were especially severe.24/7 Wall St. compared employment figures published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) for hundreds of occupations from May of 2002 and May 2012. In that time, the estimated number of advertising and promotions managers fell by nearly two-thirds. Because of the housing crisis, many occupations in the construction sector were disproportionately hurt, while many manufacturing trades lost jobs due to structural changes in the economy. These are America’s disappearing jobs.Click here to see what jobs are disappearingAccording to Martin Kohli, Chief Regional Economist for the BLS, “most of these occupations were concentrated in industries that hemorrhaged jobs during the Great Recession and have not yet bounced back to their job levels of 2002.”This is clearly the case in the construction industry where, according to a 2011 BLS study, 1.5 million jobs were lost from December 2007 to June 2009. This nearly 20% drop in construction-related jobs was the largest of any other major sector. Three of the five occupations with the largest decline in employment are in the construction sector, where job totals are still well below pre-recession levels.The number of workers in other occupations has been greatly reduced because of technological improvements. Jobs in several manufacturing occupations have been made expendable because of advances in automation. For drilling and boring machine operators working with metals and plastics, as well as for textile workers, automation has helped contribute to a more than 50% decrease in jobs between 2002 and 2012. Work in several fields, including prepress technicians and computer operators, has also been cut by improved software and automation of processes that specialists once had to do by hand.Several occupations on this list also have suffered from companies moving jobs abroad. U.S.-based semiconductor processors jobs fell by half between May 2002 and May 2012, partly because of the lower labor cost in other countries. Similarly, more than half of textile jobs were cut due to the combination of outsourcing and improved automation.To determine the jobs with the highest percentage decline in employment, 24/7 Wall St. compared data from the BLS’s Occupational Employment Statistics program for both 2002 and 2012. We included only jobs with an estimated 20,000 employees or more. The figures are estimates subject to sampling error and do not count self-employed workers. Data are collected by the program over several years. We considered only occupations that existed in both 2002 and 2012, and excluded any occupations split-up or consolidated between these periods. The textile workers occupation is a combination of two similar occupations listed by the BLS. The bulleted data is for one of these categories, but we make reference to both in the description. Further information on each occupation came from the Occupational Outlook Handbook and O*Net OnLine.Here are America's top 10 disappearing jobs, according to 24/7 Wall St."

Obama said Saturday he will ask the US Congress to authorize military action against Syria, lifting the threat of immediate strikes on President Bashar al-Assad's regime. Obama said he had decided he would go ahead and launch military action on Syria, but he believed it was important for American democracy to win the support of lawmakers. AFP PHOTO/Jim WATSON (Photo credit should read JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2fcbc240000320055b8b0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Despite President Obama’s view that growing income inequality is hurting the nation, it’s actually gotten worse during his tenure, at least according to one measure. The difference between America’s median and average wages grew at a rate of 0.28 percent under President Bush, while it’s grown at a rate of 1.14 percent -- or about four times that -- under Obama, according to The New York Times. The median wage is the midpoint of all workers’ wages, so it only ticks up when everyone is earning more. While a small group of people earning higher pay can push the average wage up. So, as the difference between the two rises, it means that those at the bottom of the income scale are making fewer gains compared to those at the top. This data point is one of many that illustrates that in Obama’s America the rich are gaining while the rest of us are struggling to get by. The wealthy took home a greater share of the nation’s income during the years following the recession, under Obama, than between 2002 and 2007, under Bush, according to a 2012 analysis from Emmanuel Saez, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Still, it’s likely not all Obama’s fault. As a more recent paper from Saez and his Berkeley colleagues notes, the U.S. has the worst income inequality in the developed world in large part because lawmakers, financiers and the wealthy have colluded for years to keep much of the nation’s money in the hands of the rich. For his part, it seems Obama at least recognizes the danger in letting the income gap grow. He told the NYT earlier this year that lawmakers should not accept a future in which income inequality continues to rise. "

Given the group's insatiable fan base, it'll come as no surprise that the 3-D concert film is a bona fide success, recouping well over the $10 million production budget during its first run in theaters. Including international grosses, ""This Is Us"" amassed an estimated $31.5 million. The Morgan Spurlock-directed documentary has already secured the No. 6 spot on the list of highest-grossing concert movies, based solely on its opening-weekend profits. It just barely falls behind similar releases from Katy Perry and The Jonas Brothers but has a ways to go to top Miley Cyrus, Michael Jackson and Justin Bieber, whose ""Never Say Never"" sits at No. 1. Whether ""This Is Us"" can hold on to No. 1 for the entirety of the Labor Day weekend is yet to be seen, but one thing is certain -- the Beliebers topped the Directioners, according to the $29.5 million haul ""Never Say Never"" enjoyed during its first few days.Coming off a two-week reign atop the rankings, ""The Butler"" took a plunge during its third round, despite upping its screen count by 220 theaters. Still, the movie added a cool $14.7 million, bringing its current domestic total to $74 million. Floating around the Top 5 for the fourth consecutive week are ""We're the Millers"" and ""Planes."" ""Millers"" nabbed $12.6 million, thrusting its total past the $100 million mark, while ""Planes"" soared to $71 million thanks to an additional $7.8 million intake. ""Instructions Not Included,"" a Spanish-language dramedy about a man whose life is complicated when the long-absent birth mother of his 6-year-old daughter returns, took the No. 5 spot. ""Instructions"" made an impressive dent, considering it features no name-recognition stars and was screened at a measly 347 theaters. The weekend's other two new releases -- the poorly reviewed Ethan Hawke-Selena Gomez vehicle ""Getaway"" and the crime thriller ""Closed Circuit"" -- both failed to impress. ""Getaway,"" which holds a 2-percent rating on Rotten Tomatoes, scraped up a dismal $4.5 million in more than 2,000 theaters. It holds the ninth-place spot. ""Closed Circuit"" took in $2.5 million in 870 theaters to claim No. 15 on the weekend's rankings.Filling out the remainder of the Top 10 were ""Elysium"" ($6.3 million), ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" ($5.2 million), ""The World's End"" ($4.8 million) and ""Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters"" ($4.4 million).

Over 3,500 firefighters are battling the destructive Rim Fire that has charred 180,000 acres and has entered a section of Yosemite National Park. The fire is currently 23 percent contained. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb141b7240000500096b790.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sept 1 (Reuters) - Firefighters battling a colossal California wildfire that has eaten away at the Yosemite National Park backcountry managed overnight to largely stem the spread of the flames, authorities said on Sunday.The fire sent heavy smoke on Saturday into the popular touristic Yosemite Valley, an area famed for towering granite rock formations, waterfalls and pine forests, obscuring views of popular landmarks on a holiday weekend at the end of the summer tourist season.Despite footage from cameras posted on the park's website showing continued smoky conditions in the park, no further road closures within Yosemite were reported, and containment lines held steady at 40 percent.""We have been able to hold the line. It's just trying to figure out how to wrap this thing up and put a bow around it,"" said fire incident spokeswoman Leslie Auriemmo, adding that there were no fresh closures in the park.The Rim Fire had charred nearly 223,000 acres (89,000 hectares) by early on Sunday, mostly in the Stanislaus National Forest which spreads out from Yosemite's western edge although the blaze has blackened about 6 percent of Yosemite's wilder backcountry.The Yosemite Valley has been open to visitors since the fire broke out two weeks ago, but smoke began spreading to the area on Friday ahead of the Labor Day holiday weekend that in the past years has seen the park fill with visitors.The smoke from the fire, whose footprint now exceeds the area of Dallas, was expected to at least partially clear on Sunday afternoon as winds shift, fire managers said.Some 4 million people visit Yosemite each year, most going during the peak months of June through August. Some 620,000 normally visit the park in August alone, but due to the fire, attendance has dropped.Close to 5,000 people are working to put out the fire, including firefighters from agencies across California and nearly 700 specially trained California prison inmates.Among the landmarks potentially in the path of the blaze are two groves of the park's famed sequoia trees.""We are working very hard to protect that. All the lines are in place so it doesn't go into those groves,"" Auriemmo said.Firefighters have carried out controlled burns around the groves to clear away debris that could otherwise fuel a fire to such an intensity that it dangerously licks at the trees' crowns.Lower-intensity fires, on the other hand, play a vital role in the reproductive cycle of the tough-barked sequoia, many of which bear the scars of past wildfires, by releasing the seeds from their cones and clearing the soil in which they germinate.The blaze has edged out the 1932 Matilija wildfire in Ventura County to become the fourth-largest California wildfire on record, according to figures from the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection.The cause of the fire remains under investigation.
