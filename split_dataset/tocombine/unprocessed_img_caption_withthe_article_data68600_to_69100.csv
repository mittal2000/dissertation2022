The Agreement provides a broad foundation for meaningful progress on climate change, and represents a dramatic departure from the Kyoto Protocol and the past 20 years of climate negotiations.Essential BackgroundAnyone who has read this blog over the past several years, or—even more so—my academic writing over the past twenty years on international climate change policy architecture, knows that I have viewed the dichotomous distinction between Annex I and non–Annex I countries as the major stumbling block to progress. That distinction was first introduced in the climate negotiations at COP-1 in Berlin in 1995. That was, in my view, an unfortunate and narrow interpretation of the sound equity principle in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC, 1992)—""common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities."" It was codified two years later in the Kyoto Protocol.The Kyoto Protocol, which has been the primary international agreement to reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions that cause global climate change, included mandatory emissions-reduction obligations only for developed countries. Developing countries had no emissions-reduction commitments. The dichotomous distinction between the developed and developing countries in the Kyoto Protocol has made progress on climate change impossible, because growth in emissions since the Protocol came into force in 2005 is entirely in the large developing countries—China, India, Brazil, Korea, South Africa, Mexico, and Indonesia. The big break came at the annual UNFCCC negotiating session in Durban, South Africa in 2011, where a decision was adopted by member countries to ""develop [by December 2015, in Paris] a protocol, another legal instrument or an agreed outcome with legal force under the Convention applicable to all Parties."" This ""Durban Platform for Enhanced Action"" broke with the Kyoto Protocol and signaled a new opening for innovative thinking (which we, at the Harvard Project on Climate Agreements, took to heart).The Paris Agreement is a Departure from the PastToday, in Paris, representatives of 195 countries adopted a new hybrid international climate policy architecture that includes: bottom-up elements in the form of ""Intended Nationally Determined Contributions"" (INDCs), which are national targets and actions that arise from national policies; and top-down elements for oversight, guidance, and coordination. Now, all countries will be involved in taking actions to reduce emissions.Remarkably, 186 of the 195 members of the UNFCCC submitted INDCs by the end of the Paris talks, representing some 96% of global emissions. Contrast that with the Kyoto Protocol, which now covers countries (Europe and New Zealand) accounting for no more than 14% of global emissions (and 0% of global emissions growth).This broad scope of participation under the new Paris Agreement is a necessary condition for meaningful action, but, of course, it is not a sufficient condition. Also required is adequate ambition of the individual contributions. But this is only the first step with this new approach. The INDCs will be assessed and revised every five years, with their collective ambition ratcheted up over time. That said, even this initial set of contributions could cut anticipated temperature increases this century to about 3.5 degrees Centigrade, more than the frequently-discussed aspirational goal of limiting temperature increases to 2 degrees C (or the new aspirational target from Paris of 1.5 degrees C), but much less than the 5–6 degrees C increase that would be expected without this action. (An amendment to the Montreal Protocol to address hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) is likely to shave an addition 0.5 C of warming.)The problem has not been solved, and it will not be for years to come, but the new approach brought about by the Paris Agreement can be a key step toward reducing the threat of global climate change.The new climate agreement, despite being path-breaking and the result of what Coral Davenport writing in The New York Times rightly called ""an extraordinary effort at international diplomacy,"" is only a foundation for moving forward, but it is a sufficiently broad and sensible foundation to make increased ambition over time feasible for the first time. Whether the Agreement is truly successful, whether this foundation for progress is effectively exploited over the years ahead by the Parties to the Agreement, is something we will know only ten, twenty, or more years from now.What is key in the Agreement is the following: the centrality of the INDC structure (through which 186 countries representing 96% of global emissions have made submissions); the most balanced transparency requirements ever promulgated; provision for heterogeneous linkage, including international carbon markets (through ""internationally transferred mitigation outcomes"" — ITMOs); explicit clarification in a decision that agreement on ""loss and damage"" does not provide a basis for liability of compensation; and 5-year periods for stocktaking and improvement of the INDCs.The Key Elements of the Paris AgreementHere are some of the highlights of what stands out to me in the Paris Agreement.Article 2 of the Agreement reaffirms the goal of limiting the global average temperature increase above the pre-industrial level to 2 degrees C, and adds 1.5 degrees C as something even more aspirational. In my opinion, these aspirational goals — which come not from science (although endorsed by most scientists) nor economics, and may not even be feasible — are much less important than the critical components of the agreement: the scope of participation through the INDC structure, and the mechanisms for implementation (see below).Article 3 makes it clear that the INDC structure is central and universal for all parties, although Article 4 blurs this a bit with references to the circumstances of developing country Parties. But throughout the Agreement, it is abundantly clear that the firewall from the 1995 Berlin Mandate has finally been breached. In addition, five-year periods for the submission of revised INDCs (and global stocktaking of the impact of the Paris Agreement) are included in Article 14. The first stocktaking review will be in 2018, with the start date for new INDCs set for 2020.Article 4 importantly describes transparency requirements (domestic monitoring, reporting, and verification). This is crucial, and represents a striking compromise between the U.S. and Europe, on the one hand, and China and India, on the other hand. All countries must eventually face the same monitoring and reporting requirements, regardless of their status as developed or developing.Article 6 provides for international policy linkage, and is thereby exceptionally important for the successful exploitation of the foundation provided by the Paris Agreement. The necessary language for heterogeneous international policy linkage (not only international carbon markets, but international linkage of other national policy instruments) is included. I have written about this key issue many times over the past ten years. It can bring down compliance costs greatly, and thereby facilitate greater ambition over time. (See our paper on this from the Harvard Project on Climate Agreements: ""Facilitating Linkage of Heterogeneous Regional, National, and Sub-National Climate Policies Through a Future International Agreement"" By Daniel Bodansky, Seth Hoedl, Gilbert E. Metcalf and Robert N. Stavins, November 2014.) The Paris Agreement accomplishes this through provision for ""internationally transferred mitigation outcomes."" With this provision, we have a new climate policy acronym — ITMOs — about which I suspect I will be writing in the future.There is considerable discussion of ""finance"" in Article 9, but the numbers do not appear in the Agreement, only in the accompanying Decision, where item 54 states that by 2025, the Parties will revisit the total quantity of funding, using the current $100 billion target as a ""floor.""Finally, the Agreement's Article 8 on Loss and Damage was necessary from the point of view of the most vulnerable countries, but the most contentious issue is settled in Decision 52, where the Parties agree that this ""does not involve or provide a basis for any liability of compensation."" That decision was absolutely essential from the perspective of the largest emitters.Anticipated Impacts of the Paris AgreementBefore I turn to my assessment of the Agreement, I should comment briefly on a topic that seems to be of considerable interest to many people (based on the questions I received from the press during my 10 days in Paris), namely what effect will the Agreement have on business, what signals will it send to the private sector?My answer is that impacts on businesses will come largely not directly from the Paris Agreement, but from the policy actions that the various Parties undertake domestically in their respective jurisdictions to comply with the Paris Agreement. I am again referring to the 186 countries which submitted Intended Nationally Determined Contributions — INDCs — under the Agreement.So, in the case of the United States, for example, those policies that will enable the country to achieve its submitted INDC are: the Clean Power Plan (which will accelerate the shift in many states from coal to natural gas for electricity generation, as well as provide incentives in some states for renewable electricity generation); CAFE (motor vehicle fuel efficiency) standards increasing over time (as already enacted by Congress); appliance efficiency standards moving up over time (as also already enacted by Congress); California's very aggressive climate policy (AB-32); and the northeast states' Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.These various policies are credible, and they will send price signals that affect business decisions (but not across the board nor with ideal efficiency, as would a national carbon tax or a national carbon cap-and-trade system). In terms of impacts on specific companies, impacts will continue to vary greatly. But a useful generalization is that a major effect of most climate policies is to raise energy costs, which tends to be good news for producers of energy-consuming durable goods (for example, the Boeing Company) and bad news for consumers of those same energy-consuming durable goods (for example, United Airlines).An Assessment with my Paris ScorecardLastly, here is my November 17th scorecard and my assessment of the five key elements I said would constitute a successful 21st Conference of the Parties:1. Include approximately 90% of global emissions in the set of INDCs that are submitted and part of the Paris Agreement (compared with 14% in the current commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol). This was obviously achieved, with total coverage reaching 96% of global emissions.2. Establish credible reporting and transparency requirements. This was achieved, through long negotiations between China and India, on the one hand, and Europe and the United States, on the other.3. Move forward with finance for climate adaptation (and mitigation) B the famous100 billion commitment. This was achieved.4. Agree to return to negotiations periodically, such as every 5 years, to revisit the ambition and structure of the INDCs. This was achieved.5. Put aside unproductive disagreements, such as on so-called ""loss and damage,"" which appears to rich countries like unlimited liability for bad weather events in developing countries, and the insistence by some parties that the INDCs themselves be binding under international law. This would have required Senate ratification of the Agreement in the United States, which would have meant that the United States would not be a party to the Agreement. There was success on both of these.Final WordsSo, my fundamental assessment of the Paris climate talks is that they were a great success. Unfortunately, as I have said before, some advocates and some members of the press will likely characterize the outcome as a ""failure,"" because the 2 degree C target has not been achieved immediately.Let me conclude where I started. The Paris Agreement provides an important new foundation for meaningful progress on climate change, and represents a dramatic departure from the past 20 years of international climate negotiations. Of course, the problem has not been solved, and it will not be for many years to come. But the new approach brought about by the Paris Agreement can be a key step toward reducing the threat of global climate change. In truth, only time will tell.________________As many of you know, over a period of ten days, we (the Harvard Project on Climate Agreements) were hard at work at COP-21 in Paris.

The common agreement on both sides of the political aisle through most of 2015 appeared to be that his campaign was eventually bound to fail - the reason being some version of the Jeb Bush position that Donald Trump, far from being a serious candidate, was actually a ""jerk."" But labeling him in this fashion was - and remains - misleading in two very critical ways. The first is that it puts far too much emphasis on the personal characteristics of Trump the man, so ironically fuelling the narcissism which is so potent a feature of how the Donald continues to campaign. The other is that critiquing him pulls our attention away from the group of die-hard supporters who still flock to his every rally, and who give every impression of liking him precisely because, to Establishment-Republicans at least, he is definitely a jerk. So who are these die-hard supporters, and why are they drawn to support Donald Trump's candidacy with such fervor? Answering that question is a vital pre-requisite to eventually keeping the White House safe from Trump's hands. For none of us will manage that if we don't first understand - and then address - the concerns of that very special breed of American who is now so keen to see a Trump presidency.I Three features of the core Trump support stand out, and all are now well documented. The first is that his support is heavily concentrated in just one major social demographic: Joan Walsh described it as ""Republican voters who didn't go to college,"" - conservative Americans, that is, now surviving on the very bottom rungs of the generally-threatened US middle class. The second is that the level of anger among that particular group of Americans is at a new and unprecedented level. Many of those turning to Donald Trump for political leadership support him precisely because they are critical of, or actively angry with, the existing political establishment - and see Trump as attractive because he is not part of that establishment. And the third is that the current set of hard-core Trump supporters are - and intend to remain - loyal to him and his cause. If Frank Luntz is right, ""half will follow him out of the Republican Party if he breaks his promise and declares as an independent."" Support, anger and loyalty - three features of the Trump electoral base that need to be fully understood by those who would reject him. Let's review them here in reverse order.LOYALTYWhen solid and committed Trump supporters are asked to explain their enthusiastic endorsement of a candidate prone to say outrageous things, one dimension of his appeal that often surfaces is his willingness to challenge conventional understandings of ""political correctness."" His supporters like him because ""he calls it like he sees it."" They like him because he moves into the center of the public conversation views and ideas which many of his supporters also hold, but which in the recent past was thought, even by them, impolitic to say. They like him, that is, for the very reason that the Republican Party establishment does not: that in campaign speech after campaign speech, he makes explicit so many of the underlying premise of the Party's ""southern strategy"" first put in place by Richard Nixon.For the last four decades, Washington-based Republicans have been perfectly willing to garner white votes in the south by tacitly going along with residual southern white racism. They just haven't wanted to admit that: and they still don't want to. Instead, they label southern racism ""parental choice"" in relation to school selection. They call it ""rolling back welfare dependency"" in relation to the sustenance of the American poor, many of whom are black or Hispanic. They call it ""supporting law and order"" when police officers shoot black teenagers; and they call it ""tax reform"" when they denude the public school system of the funds necessary to ensuring that no black/Hispanic student is actually left behind. The Donald doesn't do that. He calls Mexican immigrants criminals and racists. He calls for immigration policies that treat all Muslims as potential terrorists. He even dismisses pushy female journalists as menstrual, or liberal disabled ones as worthy of parody. His supporters like him for some/all of that, depending on the character of their own conservatism. They like him because political correctness has kept them publicly silent for too long, and because he makes a virtue of treading right over every politically-correct line. Anyone wanting to defeat Donald Trump will have, therefore, to persuade a very tough audience that political correctness helps protect them as well as those they privately denigrate.ANGERNo doubt, core Trump supporters are angry for lots of reasons, only some of which the Trump campaign addresses directly. But at the very least, it hardly damages Trump's cause, among those white voters unhappy with a black man in the White House, that their man was an active 'birther' and still leaves open the question of the president's citizenship. Being tough on immigrants also helps bind him to that group of American voters - normally white, often male and invariably middle-aged - who was most disturbed by the changing ethnic composition of the United States (with their white majority status projected to vanish in many states by/before 2050). He certainly gains supporters among that same group when he criticizes trade pacts that outsource American jobs and patterns of business deregulation that privilege Wall Street over Main Street; and parading around accompanied by all the trappings of wealth does not alienate him from conservative white males - it helps glue them to him. Donald Trump is increasingly presenting himself - in spite of his own billionaire credentials - as the champion of non-college educated American voters. Currently, ""half of Trump's supporters within the GOP stopped their education at or before high-school graduation....Only 19 percent had a college or post-college degree. Thirty-eight percent earned less than $50,000. Only 11 percent earned more than $100,000."" These are members of what Robert Reich recently labeled ""the anxious class.... Two thirds of whom are living paycheck to paycheck. Most could lose their jobs at any time."" These are men (and to a lesser degree, women) whose wages have stagnated now for over four decades, whose job security was ripped away by the recession triggered from Wall Street in 2008, who often now struggle to make a living wage, and who are in consequence increasingly denied their chance of living the American Dream. Many of them feel threatened from above by the entitlement culture of the super-rich, and even more threatened from below by the demand for equal rights for groups even more disadvantaged than they are. Few of them have the spare resources, week-on-week, to fund federal/state welfare programs through higher personal taxation. Most indeed lack the spare cash to sustain the private charitable giving that so many of them still prefer. The Trump choice of timing and theme makes sense to Americans struggling to hang on to their middle-class life-style and status, because particularly white, male, non-college educated voters are having a tough economic time as the traditional American middle class increasingly erodes. Members of that demographic are even dying earlier at a greater rate now than in the immediate past, the victims of their increasing consumption of both alcohol and drugs. Their world is not going in a direction that they personally favor. Donald Trump is promising to pull that direction back in their favor, playing on both their anger about the present and their apprehensions about the future. Anyone wanting to defeat him will need, therefore, to persuade a very tough audience that Donald Trump's explanation of their present and future condition is wrong, and that theirs by contrast is not.SUPPORTDonald Trump's current political problem is not that he has the overwhelming political support on older and less educated voters. It is that he is over-dependent on that demographic: one that is ""less affluent, less educated and less likely to turn out to vote."" His problem is that by playing to their concerns he effectively alienates other voting blocks that are socially adjacent to them but are more disadvantaged even than they are. Defending police violence is hardly the way to win African-American votes. Promising to expel 11 million undocumented voters hardly sells well in the Hispanic community. Trump is not a single-issue politician, but he is currently too much a single-constituency politician for his own long-term good: his 27 percent support among Republican voters in December currently translates into support among only 13 percent of the American electorate as a whole. That single-mindedness may win him the Republican nomination, but it will also likely create problems for him in the general election that follows. IIIf loyalty, anger and support are all key elements in Trump's current dominance of the Republican presidential field, rolling each back - and doing so in a progressive manner - is equally key to ensuring that that dominance does not persist into the general election itself.Progressive politicians will never win over the racist element of the Trump coalition, and nor should they try. But they can - and must - win over that section of the white working class that is pulled to Trump by their general anxiety about economic conditions and future prospects. The question, of course, is exactly how: and here the traditional Democratic method of coalition-building may actually get in the way. Habitually, Democratic politicians try to build their winning coalition by adding constituencies together: not least of late African-Americans given daily proof of the need to insist that black lives matter;  Hispanic voters who want a route to citizenship for an undocumented Spanish-American working class who contribute so mightily to the success of key industries like agriculture and hospitality; and working women struggling to break glass ceilings while often attempting to combine paid work with the rearing of children. Women, that is, who are and regularly pushed towards poverty by a wage system that pays them only 79 cents on the male dollar. The premise of so much of the Democrats' political campaigning in 2015 appears to be that the white male working class that is drifting towards Donald Trump is simply another constituency to be added to the rest. Both the Sanders and Clinton campaigns seem currently to be treating that addition as ultimately a simple and straightforward one, because neither campaign seems willing to concede that, at the bottom of the US income ladder, the immediate economic interests of groups do not naturally align. It is an error of analysis that Trump does not share with them, and it is one that may yet let Trump in.If they are going to stop Donald Trump in his tracks, both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders need to build their 2016 campaigns on the explicit recognition that, as American capitalism is currently organized, different sections of the American poor and near-poor do compete with one another for limited resources (for jobs, wages and welfare benefits); and that in consequence there is an explicit strategic choice to be offered to those various constituencies in November - and particularly to the angry ones. It is either for potential voters to go on treating each other as competitors to be defeated/excluded - the Trump way - or it is to come together - the progressive way - in a joint endeavor to reform a system that sets similarly-placed people in such fierce competition with each other. The politics of exclusion are the politics of Trump. The politics of inclusion have to be ours. Donald Trump may be promising to make America great again, but he is not promising to remove the competition between ethnic groups at the bottom of the US class structure for a limited set of employment opportunities and social resources. He is not, but progressives must: for unless the American Left can demonstrate how its policies, and its alone, can raise all ships, right-wing populists like Donald Trump will continue to play group against group, to the long-term mutual disadvantage of them all. IIIIt is always easier to blame other victims for a shared condition. That is why the Trump message resonates so strongly among a certain group of angry, white middle-aged and anxious voters. But playing the blame game just reinforces the system that makes the allocation of blame necessary in the first place. Which is why progressive politicians need to develop and advocate for an entirely new way of running the American economy that does not require the setting of one group of the vulnerable against another. It is also why there is no more important task before us now than that of redirecting the anger and frustration that so many Americans feel - redirecting it away from its focus on people and groups who are our immediate neighbors, and directing it towards against the properties of an entire economic and social system that only survives by setting neighbors against each other. What that means, in immediate campaigning terms, is this. It means bringing issues of social class back into the center of the political debate. It means anchoring discussions of racial and gender discrimination (real and powerful as those are) in a wider conversation about general social inequality and capitalist power (large parts of which are less visible but more potent still). It means doing what Bernie Sanders does best - proposing redistributive taxation to correct the theft of wealth and income by the top 1 percent - and it means doing what so far neither Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton do sufficiently well: articulating a growth strategy for the entire US economy that can do the two things that the alternative Republican free-trade/austerity growth strategy cannot. Articulating a progressive economic growth strategy that can pull well-paid manufacturing jobs back to the United States, in the process beginning to ease the anxieties of a middle class historically so dependent upon them. And articulating a progressive economic growth strategy that can raise all ships - one that can generate growth by anchoring prosperity at the bottom of the income ladder, so lifting the daily pressure of inadequate paychecks from the shoulders of more and more hardworking Americans. For far too long, Washington-based Democrats have remained wedded to trade policies that outsource American jobs (the Obama Administration still is) and to triangulation with Republicans that block the strengthening of trade unions and labor rights (as the Clinton Administration did so spectacularly in the 1990s). Both those things have to end, and to end immediately. The only way to win in November is to out-trump Trump at his own game: to expose him for the peddler of half-truths that he is, and to replace those half-truths with the realities of an America that is still in need of root-and-branch progressive reform. The only way to roll back right-wing populism is to beat it at its own game by developing an even stronger form of left-wing populism. That is the progressive task par excellence for 2016. A year dominated by left-wing populism will not only guarantee success against Trump and his ilk in November. It will also turn the general election of 2016 into an election which is genuinely worth winning.First posted with full academic citations at www.davidcoates.netFor a fuller statement on the articulation of class, race and gender in contemporary capitalism, see David Coates, Capitalism: The Basics.

This was even before the winter Olympics were held there, so this was a LONG time ago.In any event, I was invited to what was called a 'very special meal' at a Buddhist Monestary in the mountains outside Nagano. There, I was served a multi-course dinner consisting entirely of vegetables. This was not your typical 'vegetarian' meal. On the contrary, each dish, and there were many, was completely unique - and beautifully presented.It was more like discovering an entire cuisine that you never knew existed before. As though you were having Chinese food or Italian food for the very first time in your life. This was our experience at Noma last night. An entirely new and different cuisine. 14 or 15 courses of food and ways of preparing it that we had simply never tasted or experienced before. That alone was more than worth the price of admission.The philosophy behind Noma is that all of the ingredients are localy sourced. Denmark has its gastronomic limits when it comes to the raw material - pine trees, clams, seaweed, moss - you get the idea. But Chef Rene Rezepi's creativity is astonishing. Anyone (or almost anyone) can broil a chicken. But try making roasted kelp ice cream - then try making it taste better than vanilla! The courses, and there were many, (although each one is small), ran the spectrum from sea urchin and walnuts to egg yolk, potato and nasturtium to sliced raw squid and kelp. But to list them does not even begin to explain the incredible complexity with which they are prepared and presented. Summer squash with caviar One course, call simply Cabbage and Samphire was actually a kind of sandwich of watercress and samphire between two leaves of 'crispy cabbage' - two cabbage leaves that had been baked and prepared in a variety of ways for 26 hours - each. The taste was, as I said, unlike anything we have ever eaten before.The photo above, for example, was fermened plum and wild beach roses, but presented as a kind of disc roaring with flavor but the kind of flavors I simply have never had before.All in all, an absolutely astonishing experience.I have to, in writing this, thank my good friend Mark Bittman, the food critic for The New York Times, who help us enormously in securing this reservation. Even then, it took nearly a year of back and forth emails. But believe me, it was worth it. Oh, and one more thing.I lived in Copenhagen for about 6 months in the 1980s when I was working with Jan Stenbeck and we were building TV3, the first commercial TV station in Denmark (and VJ-driven!).At that time, my taste in food was, well, let us say, a bit less developed. In fact, I ate at the same Chinese restaurant pretty much every day. Remarkably, last night, in a walk along the Strogt, the walking street, Lisa and I found the restaurant. It is still in business!  27 years later - still in businessSadly, Noma will not be. Having achieved the absolute pinnacle of success in the food world, Noma is closing its doors for the last time, one year from today - so get going!"

And yet, so many worthy ventures and causes don't get traction because the people behind them struggle to say what their audience most needs and wants to hear--that is, why are you valuable? If you ask most leaders, they will tell you that communicating value is paramount. But most of us don't actually speak or write in value terms. It's a lot like weight control--we all know we must eat less and be more active to shed unwanted pounds. But it's really hard to do, especially when inertia and temptation are everywhere. So it is with the expression of value. We know we should speak about the things that matter most to our customers, clients, donors and other audiences, but we haven't--or think we can't--invest the time to figure it out. Recently I sat with a business owner who spent a great deal of time talking about her experience as an accountant. I will confess that I glazed over--visions of tax returns and balance sheets danced in my head. Plus, I already have an accountant I like and so didn't think what she had to offer was relevant. As the conversation continued, I realized that what she was offering was not accounting services, but business counsel, based on her knowledge and experience as a CPA, to help companies discover how to grow. Now I was interested. She'd spent so much time delivering an experience list, she'd neglected to address her value.To express value, we first have to hit the pause button, step back, and take the time to understand what our audiences need or desire most. We have to look inside and outside of ourselves and sometimes we find out things we'd rather not know. Perhaps our product isn't as useful as we think it is, or our customer service is so annoying that our clients are going elsewhere. We might even learn some of the toughest realities to absorb--like our own team finds our organization bureaucratic or autocratic, making them ripe for poaching by competitors.Communicating value isn't about a list of things you do or products you offer. It isn't even enough to share stories about people who have used your product or service or become involved in your cause. While I'm a big believer in storytelling to enhance communication, narratives alone don't help you communicate value. So what does? Here are a few tips for your New Year's communications diet. Ask. Reach out and request feedback from your key audiences. Find out why they love or hate what you do. Probe more deeply. If your respondents say your product is great, ask what in particular delights them. And if the comments are glowing, ask if there is anything they'd like to see you do or change.Really listen to what's said--especially the words that are used. We recently worked with a client who said they thought their differentiator was that they are client- centric. Their key audiences agreed, only they didn't say it that way; instead, they spoke of how the firm really listened or that the company ""got into their DNA"" to understand and then deliver what was wanted. Accept What You Hear (in Balance). This may be the most difficult thing of all, especially if the feedback is negative. Avoid the tendency to dismiss critics, as you risk putting your head in the sand. Domino's Pizza once floundered amid harsh criticism of its taste and delivery protocols. But by revamping and rebranding their product, they also bolstered their stock price. By the same token, be careful to keep feedback in balance. Sometimes we focus on the one negative comment that stands out against ten positive ones. That's just as harmful as dismissing what you don't want to hear. Frame Your Offerings in Terms that Matter to Your Audience. When stating what you do, always frame your communications in terms that specifically answer the needs and/or aspirations of your target audiences. (You will understand what those are if you ask and listen.) At Wainger Group, we used to say that we were a strategic communications firm. So what, right? What we now say is that we help enterprises clear the communications fog--inside and outside their organizations--that prevents their most important audiences from seeing their value. Don't Stop When You Think You've Figured It Out. Value communication is not a task, but a process that is never fully done. It is like a beautiful rose garden that has to be carefully tended and pruned, otherwise the garden becomes overgrown or weeds obscure the blooms. As we begin the New Year, invest in an incisive look at what and how you communicate your organization's mission, purpose and value. I'd be interested in hearing how well your team communicates value externally, and how that communication aligns with your internal conversations."

However it is important to point out that your 20s isn't a throwaway decade. What you do matters a lot. Here are 9 ways to make the most of these exciting but unsettled years:1. Consider money to be an outcome, not an objective. It's understandable that you want to achieve a comfortable lifestyle. The emphasis should not be on money alone. What should you set your sights on instead? Identify what you enjoy doing and become an absolute expert at it. Without many obligations in your twenties, you can afford to take risks. Follow your passion without becoming distracted by short-term rewards.2. Deliver value. Achieving wealth and success are common objectives, but many people will fail to reach these lofty goals. While being wealthy and successful can make your life easier, you should focus on delivering something of value to the world. The people who make the biggest changes in the world didn't take that route just to achieve fame or fortune. They wanted to make changes in the way we do things. Mark Zuckerberg's Facebook was designed as an internal networking website for Harvard students, and now it serves 1.4 billion people worldwide. Money comes naturally after you've followed your passion and provided value.3. Be curious. Foster your curiosity, and it will lead you to amazing places, ideas and concepts. Your level of curiosity is what could ultimately define you and separate you from the rest.4. Read widely. Read self-help, how-to, personal achievement, communications, leadership and biography books. You will make mistakes in your twenties, but you won't find reading these books to be a time waster. Good sources of reading lists range from respected journals and blogs to Amazon (look for books with high ratings in categories of your choice).5. Learn from adversity. The challenges you will encounter are unimaginable here and now. Choose to learn and grow from these situations. Seeing obstacles as learning opportunities will help you acquire new insights. Obstacles can ultimately make you a more capable person.6. Break out of your comfort zone. This cliché is actually true. Remaining within familiar territory means that you don't explore what you could become. Dare to test the limits of yourself.7. You are who you associate with. This is an old saying that can be generally applied in many social and professional scenarios. You are the average of the five people you associate with the most. Whether you are joining a sporting team, choosing investors, or choosing the people you're going to have dinner with. Keep this in mind and use it as a guiding principle when you choose who you surround yourself with.8. Create your own opportunity. Hard work, strategy, stepping back and looking at the bigger picture, and perseverance are all needed to create your own opportunity. Opportunity rarely finds you. You need to find it.9. Take action. There are usually no guarantees in life. However there is one that can be guaranteed. That is if you don't take action, there will be no outcome at all. The only outcome will be that you didn't achieve it. What you do in your 20s will have an impact on the rest of your life. What are you going to do with this time? What are you going to do today? Don't leave it for tomorrow."

Is it possible you need a higher-level overhaul of the way you're approaching your goals?Let's try something different this year.1) Get smart. Nothing says boredom and dissatisfaction than putting a halt to learning. Without fresh ideas, you'll stumble at best and atrophy at worst. Never stop trying to teach an old dog new tricks. Opening your mind to new information will feed your creativity and fuel your ambitions. Pick up a book. Watch a documentary. Follow someone on social media whom you admire for his wisdom. Nourish your brain.2) Try fearlessness. What, actually, will happen if you fail at something? Answer: Not much. You may be ridiculed or embarrassed but...so what? Without some gamble, you don't run the risk of success either. Your dread of ending up red-faced isn't reason enough not to try. Go ahead. Take a chance. Every misstep is a precious lesson. Failure isn't a dirty word. It's a gift.3) Don't lose yourself. Being responsible for others can bring us joy, but be careful you're not always putting others' needs before your own. If you commit all your time and energy to others, you'll quickly find your own dreams and goals on the back burner. There's a balance. Create it.4) Practice gratitude. If you had a hot shower this morning or can remember your last meal, you have something to be grateful for. If you've lived to see the beginning of this new year, well...you get it. In the grind of daily life, it's sometimes hard to acknowledge our truest blessings. If you must, start small. The more you're grateful, the more you'll have to be grateful for.5) Chase your own goals. Establish whether your goals are ones you want for yourself, or those others want for you. Being steered in a direction by another's hopes for you is a surefire recipe for eventual resentment and disgruntlement. Get good with your internal compass and follow where it leads you.6) Take a step. One step. Any step. Your goals won't materialize until you start moving toward them. Think of them as someone you'd like to meet at a party. To even have a chance at an introduction, you have to approach her. Standing in the same place -- and hoping she'll make her way over to you -- won't get you anywhere. Same goes for your goals.The closer you inch toward them, the greater your odds of achieving them.7) Forgive and apologize. Unresolved grievances take up a lot of space in your brain. Ruminating about how you've been hurt in the past isn't worth the time you're investing in it. Likewise, if you owe someone an apology, offer it. Not making amends for the pain you've cause others is an energy suck. Say you're sorry and lose the distraction.8) Watch your self-talk. If you're consistently giving yourself messaging that ensures your failure (""I can't open my own business...or write that blog...or meet someone new...or go back to school...""), then you must figure out a way to shift to an achieving mentality. To start, fix the way you talk to yourself. Remember, you're listening.9) Build a tribe. Find like-minded folks who will support you in your endeavors. You'll get nearer to making those resolutions a reality if you hold yourself accountable. Having others cheer you on and celebrate your successes with you won't hurt either.10) Respect yourself. Achieving your goals begins with feeling pretty good about yourself. Don't expect to manifest your dreams if you're engaging in behaviors that have you saying, ""What was I thinking?"" on a consistent basis. Shame, regret, and embarrassment are all roadblocks to achieving your goals. 11) Ignore the naysayers. There will always be those who have some skewed investment in keeping you down. Whether they're envious of your ballsiness or they're trying to protect you from disappointment, that's their crap to work through. You don't need others to approve of the song your heart is singing. It's your song. It's your dream. Sing along and dream on.This post originally appeared on AbbyRodman.com"

The lawsuit accuses the comedian of portraying the women as liars in the press after they publicly shared allegations that Cosby engaged in sexual misconduct. The suit, which was first filed in December 2014 by Linda Traitz, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese, gained four more plaintiffs -- Louisa Moritz, Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis and Angela Leslie -- in November. Bill Cosby has countersued, arguing the women's allegations hurt his career.The judge, U.S. Magistrate Judge David H. Hennessy, denied Camille Cosby's motion to quell a subpoena for her deposition due in part to her role as her husband's business manager, The Boston Globe reported. It is ""at least plausible that Mrs. Cosby is in possession of information"" relevant to the case, the 12-page ruling read. Camille Cosby had argued that conversations between herself and her husband were private.In the past year, more than 50 women have come forward to accuse Bill Cosby of incidents of sexual assault or misconduct. He has steadfastly denied all of them.The judge's ruling came just one day after Cosby turned himself in to authorities on an aggravated indecent assault charge based on the accusations of Andrea Constand -- the first criminal charges against the 78-year-old comedian despite years of hushed accusations. Constand described taking an ""herbal pill"" at the comedian's home that made her feel ""paralyzed"" before Cosby guided her to his couch, where he forcibly placed her hand on his penis and sexually assaulted her in 2004. She had been invited to visit under the pretense of discussing her career. If convicted on the assault charge, Cosby could be sentenced to five to 10 years in prison.On New Year's Eve, the embattled comedian took to Twitter to thank his supporters in his first public comment since being charged with sexual assault.Camille is scheduled to testify Jan. 6, while Bill Cosby's next court appearance is scheduled for Jan. 14.

You can see it when you look at Hitler's Germany.""There are later examples in various other countries,"" he told reporters, according to a recording broadcast by the Dogan news agency.The ruling AK Party, founded by Erdogan, has put a new constitution at the heart of its agenda after winning back a majority in a November parliamentary election.It agreed with the main opposition CHP on Wednesday to revive efforts to forge a new constitution.Opposition parties agree on the need to change the constitution, drawn up after a 1980 coup and still bearing the stamp of its military authors, but do not back the presidential system envisaged by Erdogan, fearing it will consolidate too much power in the hands of an authoritarian leader.

Israeli newspaper Haaretz reports that the shooter fled the scene. Authorities apprehended a suspect on a nearby street shortly after the shooting, but are continuing a manhunt.Haaretz says that Israeli police have identified the suspect as a 29-year-old Palestinian citizen of Israel from the Northern Israeli town of Arara. He stole the gun used in the shooting from his father, who works in security. The suspect’s father contacted authorities after noticing the weapon was missing.There is a “growing consensus among security officials,” according to Haaretz, that the shooting, which took place on Dizengoff Street, a café-filled main street, was a terror attack.Nati Shakked, owner of Simta bar, which was attacked, told Reuters that the assailant had waited on a bench outside before taking a machine gun out of a bag and ""shooting in every direction.""A video captured the graphic moment the attacker opened fire. Lily, an owner of a nearby beauty salon who was in the bar at the time, told HuffPost that when she realized it was a shooting, she dropped to the ground and hid under the bar.Another woman who was in the bar told reporters of Israel's Channel 2 that she and seven others hid in a storage closet in the basement of a bar during the attack, ""lying down"" on the door to keep it from being penetrated.""Our whole body was shaking,"" she said. ""There were very big booms, tremblings -- it all happened above us. Mostly it was gunshots.""The attack comes amid a period of heightened violence between Israelis and Palestinians. Palestinians have killed 19 Israelis and an American since the start of October, mostly in spontaneous stabbings or car-ramming attacks. Israeli security forces have killed 142 Palestinians over the same period, according to the Palestinian health ministry -- a figure that includes suspected Palestinian assailants shot dead and Palestinians killed in clashes with Israeli troops.This is a developing story.

During a Dec. 31 episode of the BBC's ""The Graham Norton Show,"" featuring the actress and fellow Oscar winner Eddie Redmayne, the host brought out some old modeling photos of a sweater-clad Redmayne -- much to his embarrassment. Lawrence could relate, kind of.As a younger woman, she explained, she'd scored a modeling gig for risqué teen clothier Abercrombie and Fitch. Yet her photos never saw the dim light of the retailer's mall stores. ""I didn’t know why,"" Lawrence began. ""My agent wrote and asked why. And they literally only responded with the photos.""""Their whole idea was like, 'We want real people,'"" she said, explaining how the shoot took place on a beach where the models were asked to toss around a football. ""The other models were, like, playing football in a pretty way. Not me! In all of the photos I’ve got a red face, covered in sweat, my nostrils are flared, like Aagh!"" she said, demonstrating.""At one point, a girl yelled, 'Get her away from me,'"" Lawrence added.Also on HuffPost:"

30,RELIGION,White Supremacy As 2016's Urgent Faith Challenge,"Rev. Dr. Susan Brooks Thistlethwaite, ContributorProfessor of Theology, Chicago Theological Seminary",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/something-wicked-white-su_b_8902982.html,"Something Wicked This Way Comes is not only a sinister 1962 fantasy novel by Ray Bradbury, it is also descriptive of the malevolent and growing power of white supremacy in the United States.",2016-01-01,2016-01-01-1451663986-1751811-WhiteSilenceEqualsMoreViolence.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-01-01-1451663986-1751811-WhiteSilenceEqualsMoreViolence-thumb.jpg,"Something Wicked This Way Comes is not only a sinister 1962 fantasy novel by Ray Bradbury, it is also descriptive of the malevolent and growing power of white supremacy in the United States.This accelerating menace is an urgent faith challenge in 2016.Here's where we are today: African American children and adults are killed with impunity, callously injured and incarcerated at rates that make the United States a world pariah. Conservative presidential candidates are getting explicit support from white supremacist organizations that have crawled out of the woodwork, drawn by hateful rhetoric against African Americans, immigrants and Muslims. While white supremacy is by no means new, this is a new moment of accelerated marketing of fear and hate packaged as a promise that if you are a white person you can get a sense of control over your life. Never mind the real reason why you feel out of control is because your job went to China and your company executives spent your retirement. White supremacists, like the carnival barker in Bradbury's novel, know the secret desire for power in the human heart, and the buried fears that give rise to those desires, and they exploit them.Across a vast and diverse faith community, we have to recognize this desire and its powerful emotional lure: feeling superior as a white person over those of other races, especially over African Americans, is formative for many, taken in sometimes with mother's milk and continuously fed through culture, law, politics, economics and religion. Yes, religion. I know as a white Christian pastor and activist, I need to step it up, and confront this menace both within Christianity, as well as in society. A white God, a white Jesus, and a white church will never be allies in the struggle against white supremacy; they will, at best, be unconscious enablers. As sociologist of religion Dr. Cheryl Townsend Gilkes notes in her chapter ""Still the Most Segregated Hour, """"Religion is a motive force in the construction of the United States as a racialized society."" If a white person would be a faith ally in the struggle against white supremacy, it is crucial to look inward at religion and, frankly, change that, while at the same time attending carefully to those who are being crushed. Don't blithely assume you can help. This is where liberation theology can be helpful. Liberation theology always starts with contextual analysis, as Mary Potter Engel and I write in Lift Every Voice: Constructing Christian Theologies from the Underside. Let's start from the realization that white supremacy IS the context of the U.S., that it is a long-standing system of vast exploitation and immorality as Ta-Nehisi Coates wrote so powerfully in The Atlantic as ""The Case for Reparations."" ""Two hundred fifty years of slavery. Ninety years of Jin Crow. Sixty years of separate but equal. Thirty-five years of racist housing policy."" This, this is why white supremacy is wicked. Wickedness is more than sin and evil. It is, in fact, the malignancy of sin and evil combining and reinforcing each other, as Mary Potter Engel put it so well in our book:Evil and sin together may be called ""wickedness,"" the complex condition of the lack of right relation in the world in which we live naturally, socially, and individually.Evil is the systems created by centuries of oppression, sin is the ""free and discrete acts...that create or reinforce these structures of oppression."" Structures. Systems. White Christian complicity. Take those as a given. Then, move outside theology to get more help. Liberation theologies often use social science as a lever in rooting out dominance in traditional theologies and finding ways to make practical common cause in liberation struggles. Sociologists have described what they call wicked problems. These are problems that are driven by a vast number of interconnected forces that sustain and grow them. Wicked problems are characteristically difficult either to recognize or to solve. Horst Rittel, one of the first to formalize a theory of wicked problems, cites ten characteristics of these complicated social issues, some of which stand out as particularly applicable to white supremacy. Wicked problems ""have no definitive formulation"" as they have different patterns in different locations. White supremacy in Chicago, IL, for example, has important differences in terms of historical roots, as well as economic and political structures than the white supremacy of let's say, Charleston, South Carolina. Effective activists know this. They use this.White supremacy is a ""wicked problem"" because it ""bleeds."" That means there are no boundaries to its causes or its effects. Instead, white supremacy permeates education, law, law enforcement, economics, politics, religion and, broadly speaking, culture. Sexism, racism, homophobia, trans-phobia, Islamophobia and classism all need examination and action. One telling example: a ""celebration"" of an African American woman athlete such as Serena Williams devolves into a discussion of her arms or her general body shape, engaging in body shaming and reinforcing racist attitudes toward African American women. The model of Wicked Problems holds that those who would engage them must ""take responsibility"" for the consequences of their interventions. This is a big one for faith activists. Your good intentions don't, and I intend this in a theological sense, mean a damn. Don't just muck in. Study, care, consultation and coordination are a big part of being effective in dealing with even a part of wicked problems. It is also important to realize there is no ""solving"" wicked problems, there is only creativity that can tackle its many manifestations, subvert and mitigate their most destructive effects and engage creative alternatives.#BlackLivesMatter has rightly garnered respect and support from white faith organizers because of its specificity, creativity, analytical wisdom and strong actions. But it is crucial that white people of faith engage our fellow white citizens, Christian and non-Christian and do a lot of work. If you have read this far into this post, you already likely believe that. Here are some examples: Showing Up for Racial Justice is a ""national network of groups and individuals organizing white people for racial justice. Through community organizing, mobilizing and education, SURJ moves white people to act as part of a multi-racial majority for justice with passion and accountability."" SURJ was founded in 2009. It is telling that in January of 2015, there were only 12 chapters. Today there are 140, and 14 working groups such as SURJ Faith and SURJ Families. There are others, of course, such as GroundWork. This group, out of Wisconsin, organizes white people ""against racism and white privilege and for racial justice and equity in our daily lives from the heart, with dignity, and integrity."" It is collaborative and practical. Chicago Theological Seminary where I work, has been intensely focusing on racism and white privilege for several years. Many other seminaries have as well. Individual churches are making such commitments, such as All Saints Church in Pasadena. There are many others. This is all good, but like in Bradbury's novel, I see the wickedness of white supremacy as a storm rising in 2016, threatening and coming towards us. White supremacy is dangerously growing. There are crackles and flashes of astonishingly virulent hate and fear. We will need all the faith confidence we can muster against the ""principalities and powers"" (Romans 8:38-39). There is good news. I believe no matter how powerful wicked systems can be, they are no match for grace shared in community and the love of God and neighbor. But you can see the winds gathering, so we better work harder."
