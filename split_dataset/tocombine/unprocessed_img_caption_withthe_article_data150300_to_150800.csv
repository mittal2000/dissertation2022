Hosted by the George W. Bush Institute, the summit focuses on the health, economic empowerment, and education for African women -- and it's a rare occasion for many of the continent's impressive first ladies to come together on one stage. Michelle Obama and Laura Bush played host in outfits that were classically ""them"": Laura in solid red, Michelle in a print. More impressive was the diverse array of fashions on the African first ladies, including Matilda Amissah of Ghana, Sia Nyama Koroma of Sierra Leone, Roman Tesfaye of Ethiopia, Janet Museveni of Uganda, Nompumelelo Ntuli-Zuma of South Africa and Maria da Luz Dai Guebuza of Mozambique. Even as the group discussed weighty issues, the importance of appearance -- specifically, the scrutiny of first ladies' appearances -- was on everyone's minds. Our current FLOTUS and Mrs. Bush joked about the pressure:MRS. OBAMA: But being able to pursue our passions and do things that not only help our country and connect us with the rest of the world, it's a great privilege. So while people are sort of sorting through our shoes and our hair -- (laughter) -- whether we cut it or not --We definitely do -- even if we acknowledge that Michelle's bangs are looking awesome these days.Check out the eclectic group of first ladies and read more about President and Michelle Obama's trip to Africa here.Want more?

At last -- free in-flight TV!Beginning Tuesday, DISH Network is providing free access to live TV on Southwest Airlines on a platform called 'TV Flies Free.' Southwest customers using iPads, iPhones, iPod touches, and other Internet-ready devices now have access to 13 live TV channels and ""up to 75 on-demand shows on the airline’s more than 400 Wi-Fi-enabled aircraft,"" according to DISH's press release.DISH's 'Boston Boys' announced the news to Southwest passengers flying from Boston to Baltimore by presenting a free iPad 2 on behalf of both companies (*WATCH VIDEO BELOW*).“DISH and Southwest are two iconic American brands known for putting the customer first, providing products, services and experiences they truly demand,” said DISH President and CEO Joe Clayton. “It’s only logical our two companies should team up to give passengers free live TV and on-demand shows on flights around the country.”Southwest customers will need to download the DISH Anywhere and Hopper Transfers apps onto their Internet-ready devices in order to gain access to the network but do not need to be DISH Network customers.In-flight entertainment would become much more accessible and prevalent throughout air carriers if the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) follows through on its plans to ease its restrictions that limit passengers to use only certain types of electronics devices during allotted intervals on flights."
3,PARENTING,Single Fathers: Pew Research Reports Number Of Single Dads Has Jumped In U.S.,Lisa Belkin,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/single-fathers-pew-research_us_5b9d516ee4b03a1dcc869a61,"Yes, single mothers still ferociously outnumber single fathers. And yes, the percentage of households with minor children",2013-07-02,Loving Hispanic father with his daughter on the beach,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d516e2400005000538a6c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"There is yet another data point to add to the changing portrait of American parents: the number of single fathers has risen ninefold since demographers began measuring it more than 50 years ago. Back in 1960 there were fewer than 300,000 households headed by single dads, according to an analysis of Census Bureau data released today by the Pew Research Center. By 2011 that had grown to more than 2.6 million. That’s more than twice the rate of growth of single mother-led households, which quadrupled in the same period, to 8.6 million from 1.9 million. Yes, single mothers still ferociously outnumber single fathers. And yes, the percentage of households with minor children that are headed by dads is still small -- only 8 percent of all US households at last count. But men reflect a growing portion of single parent households -- almost one quarter, compared with only 14 percent in 1960. And, single parent households are a growing share of all American families; back in 1960, 92 percent of all households had two married parents raising children while in 2011 it was down to 67 percent. The study found measurable differences between the homes of single mothers and fathers. First, there is more likely to be a partner present. Though the study defines a “single father” as an unmarried man who heads hisr household and lives with his own minor children, he is not necessarily the only parent present. Among these “single fathers”, 41 percent are cohabiting with a partner, far higher than the 16 percent of single mothers who are doing the same. Single fathers are also different from fathers in married households; married fathers are more likely to be older, better off financially and white. Why the increase? Possible reasons include an increase in both the rate of divorce and non-marital births since 1960, both of which have contributed to an increase in the number of single parents of both sexes. At the same time, courts have been more likely to grant custody to fathers.It is also a reflection of the changing role of fathers in general. They are, arguably, where women were a decade ago in their awareness that they want a different life/work equation but are not yet sure what theirs should be. They also want a different relationship with their children than their own fathers were expected to have. And they are definitely heading in the right direction, and taking the whole of society along with them. "
