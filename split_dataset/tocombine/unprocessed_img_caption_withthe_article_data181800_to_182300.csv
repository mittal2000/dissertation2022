Some",2012-07-31,"LOS ANGELES, CA - JULY 24: Actress Olivia Munn arrives at a screening of Millennium Entertainment's 'The Babymakers' at the Silent Movie Theatre on July 24, 2012 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c11d4240000500053106f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Actress Olivia Munn recently revealed that she pulls out her eyelashes as a result of the ""impulsive control"" disorder trichotillomania. People with the disorder have the urge to pull out their hair, whether it be on their scalp, eyelashes, eyebrows or elsewhere on the body, leading to thinned hair.""I don't bite my nails, but I rip my eyelashes,"" Munn, 32, told the New York Daily News. ""It doesn't hurt, but it's really annoying. Every time I run out of the house, I have to stop and pick up a whole set of fake eyelashes.""As many as 4 percent of people may have trichotillomania, according to the National Institutes of Health, and the condition is four times more common among women. The disorder is usually first seen before people reach age 17, and the period of hair-pulling usually only lasts for about a year, the NIH said. Symptoms of trichotillomania include actually pulling your hair out; wanting to pull the hair out and feeling relieved after you've pulled it out; playing, chewing, eating or rubbing the extracted hair; and having patchy, bald or sparse areas on the body where the hair used to be, according to the Mayo Clinic. ""They may spend hours in front of a mirror in these very odd postures trying to locate that one hair that they know is there that they feel doesn't belong,"" trichotillomania expert Dr. Nancy Keuthen told ABC News.People may also feel tense either right before, or if trying to resist, pulling out the hair, according to Mental Health America. ""Whenever I get emotional, or sometimes very stressed, or if I'm upset, I go for my hair,"" Jena Metts, who at the time had trichotillomania, told ABC News in 2008. ""And [it's] perfectionism sometimes. If there's like a little hair sticking out, I want to pull it.""The exact cause of the condition isn't known, but the Mayo Clinic reports that it may be a result of genetics and the environment, and possibly even differences in brain chemicals.Not all doctors agree on the treatment method for trichotillomania, according to the National Institutes of Health. Some may prescribe medicines like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or naltrexone; for other cases, habit reversal techniques or behavioral therapy can help to stop the hair-pulling.

Because I wanted to have the power to make a difference in the world - I wanted to have a voice that would be heard.""She's well on her way. Summers, a 27-year-old blonde from Nottingham, England, is known in the British tabloids as the girl of many surgeries, having spent somewhere between £30,000 and £60,000 on cosmetic procedures. But one procedure in particular is landing her back in headlines: a seriously botched lip job.After receiving a £200 lip injection, the Mirror writes, Summers lips expanded to four times their normal size. She told the newspaper, ""I looked in the mirror and screamed. All I could see was a monster looking back at me.""The result, seen in Summers' Instagram pics below, was pretty bad. Worse than the mere ""trout pout"" that many celebs sport, Summers' lips ballooned. (Hey, at least it wasn't her butt?) Now Summers may have finally found her calling, her way to make a difference in the world: warning other women against bad plastic surgery. She tweeted today, ""Hope my lip story will help other girls a bit and warn them that they must be careful !""We should say so. Unfortunately, Summers' lips land her in our unofficial ""Plastic Surgery Disasters"" Hall of Fame, below. But do even the scariest cautionary tales persuade women (and men) from going under the knife? In the U.S., cosmetic surgery numbers increased from 2010 to 2011, with over 1 million surgical procedures performed (and that doesn't count Botox, Restylane, etc). You can even get cosmetic surgery on your toes, although we don't recommend it.Come to think of it, we don't recommend getting plastic surgery anywhere.

Swedish handball player Johanna Wiberg prefers it in blue from her knee to her groin. British sprinter Dwain Chambers has even worn it with a Union Jack design.Athletic tape made in every color under the sun seems to be the latest must-have sports injury treatment at London 2012, where athletes may have been influenced by other big name tape fans such as Serena Williams and David Beckham.Called Kinesio tape and developed by a Japanese doctor more than 30 years ago, the adhesive strapping is designed to provide muscle and joint support without restricting movement.According to Kinesio's product website, it is also designed to be used with a particular taping technique - a skill practitioners need to learn on a special training course.More than 4,000 people in Britain are now trained in the art of Kinesio taping, it says, and many of them look after some of the country's top sportsmen and women.But does it really work?Compared with the abundance of its use, rigorous scientific research on Kinesio tape is scant. But a handful of research papers suggest its ability to relieve pain or improve muscle strength is limited.""Kinesio tape may be of some assistance to clinicians in improving pain-free active range of movement immediately after tape application for patients with shoulder pain,"" wrote scientists in one study published in the Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physiotherapy.But the researchers added their findings did not support the use of Kinesio tape for decreasing pain intensity or disability in patients with shoulder problems.SCIENTIFICALLY SUPPORTED?In a review of all the scientific research so far, published in the Sports Medicine journal in February, researchers found ""little quality evidence to support the use of Kinesio tape over other types of elastic taping in the management or prevention of sports injuries"".Kevin Anderson, managing director of Kinesio UK, which supplies the tape in Britain and trains people in how to apply it, says the scientific research has yet to catch up with what athletes and physiotherapists say about the tape's benefits.""There's a lot more needed on the research side to confirm the positive results we're seeing so far,"" he told Reuters.""There's nothing magical in the tape, it certainly can't improve your performance or make you into Superman, but the way people use the tape is to lift the skin, reduce the pressure and that helps relieve pain and swelling.""Whatever the science, German beach volleyball player Sara Goller sported two long pink strips of the tape on her left leg during matches on Tuesday, while her partner Laura Ludwig had two vertical blue strips on her stomach.""I don't really mind the color, it's more about what it does. It can release or put tension on a muscle, it depends on what you want. Our physio is really good at doing it,"" Goller told Reuters.FADS, FASHIONS AND PLACEBOSJohn Brewer, a professor of sports science at Britain's University of Bedfordshire, remains doubtful.""As a scientist, I'm still not convinced about the underlying mechanisms,"" he told Reuters, voicing skepticism about the supposed 'lifting' effect and the ability of tape applied to the skin to enhance the performance of muscles deep inside the body.Steve Harridge, a professor of human and applied physiology at King's College London, said many athletes appeared to be wearing tape even when they had no injury, possible hoping for some preventative or enhancing effect.""It may be a fashion accessory, and it may be just one of those fads that come along from time to time, but to my knowledge there's no firm scientific evidence to suggest it will enhance muscle performance,"" he told Reuters.Both scientists agreed, however, that there may be a benefit, in the form of the placebo effect.""The fact that athletes think it's going to do them some good can help in a psychological way,"" said Harridge.An effective placebo, Brewer said, ""could make all the difference between success and failure"".(Additional reporting by Ross Chainey, Thomas Pilcher and Nigel Hunt, editing by Mark Trevelyan)"
