Kelly as their special guest on stage amid rumors that French electro duo Daft Punk would join them.Phoenix's lead singer Thomas Mars, Deck d'Arcy, Laurent Brancowitz and Christian Mazzalai, played a selection of old and new songs against the star-lit backdrop of the festival, held in the desert in Indio, California.The band, which is due to release its album ""Bankrupt!"" on April 22, sang new songs ""Entertainment"" and ""The Real Thing"". It also serenaded the crowd with favorites from its last album, ""Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix"", such as ""Lisztomania"" and ""Fences"".Kelly's appearance came as a surprise to an audience expecting to see Daft Punk after a teaser music video by the electronic group was played at the start of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' set on Friday.He joined Phoenix for a mash-up of his hit single ""Ignition"" with Phoenix's hit ""1901"".This is the third time Phoenix has performed at Coachella and its first time headlining the annual three-day event.""Our vision of Coachella is that you can never be medium. It's either fantastic or a big catastrophe, we don't like medium things. For us, it's always been an extreme experience. The first time we played was our worst show ever, and the second time was one of our best shows ever, it's either a huge failure or success,"" Mazzalai told Reuters ahead of the band's set.After the success of the 2009 album ""Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix"", which spawned hits such as ""1901"" and won a Grammy for best alternative music album, Phoenix returned to the studio to record ""Bankrupt!"".""We have the album of our dreams and there was no compromising at all. In three years, we grew up and we have a different vision, but we're still the same with having total freedom,"" Mazzalai said.""Bankrupt!"" was inspired by the idea of ""starting from scratch with a clean slate"" and led the band to explore new ideas and themes, he said. DJS GET COACHELLA DANCINGLos Angeles indie electro-rock group The Postal Service warmed up the crowd ahead of The xx and Phoenix's headline slot.The group, led by Death Cab For A Cutie frontman Ben Gibbard, set a mellow and dream-like vibe as darkness fell over the festival grounds.British indie pop band The xx pumped up the tempo with tracks such as ""Islands"" and featured special guest Solange Knowles, sister of singer Beyonce, performing a cover of Aaliyah's ""Hot Like Fire.""""It really is a dream come true to be playing the main stage,"" lead singer Romy Madley-Croft said to the crowd.While rock acts dominated the Coachella line-up this year, festival organizers made sure to include dance acts to stick with their tradition of providing a stage for the growing influence of electronic dance music.Baauer, the 23-year-old DJ behind viral YouTube hit ""Harlem Shake"", performed early on Saturday and made the crowd wait until the end to hear his hit song.""Harlem Shake"" has led to a trend in which people make videos of themselves standing still during the first part of the song before breaking into wild, energetic dancing.Italian DJ Benny Benassi was one of the highlights at the Coachella dance tent, with the crowd spilling out as they revelled in his dance-floor tracks. British dance act Hot Chip kept the party going with crowd-pleasers including ""Over and Over"" and ""Ready For The Floor"".Rapper 2 Chainz, one of the few R&B and hip hop acts at Coachella this year, performed as did British electro-folk musician Bat for Lashes.British folk artist Ben Howard played a soft set of songs from his ""Every Kingdom"" album, while the Dropkick Murphys got the audience dancing with their crowd-rousing Irish rock tracks including ""Rose Tattoo"".

The private collection of Islamic Art is due to be exhibited from January 8 - 13th at Bonham's in Edinburgh. This collection has never been seen in public before and is Scotland's largest private and internationally important collection of Islamic art including over 650 items from pre-Islamic and Islamic culture. Primarily featuring objects from the Land of Timur, Central Asia; those on display are ancient ceramics, bronzes, books, goblets, glass, furniture, paintings, textiles and coins.

Lovingly pieced together over 40 years, Davids' collection featured manuscripts by Keats, Auden, Eliot, Hopkins, Burns, Dickinson and even Winston Churchill. Bonhams called it the ""finest collection of poetry ever come to auction.""It seems John Keats has the healthiest legacy of the impressive bunch. A draft of just part of his well-known poem ""I stood tiptoe on a little hill,"" sold for £181,250 (about $280,000), more than four times its estimate. Here's an excerpt:I stood tip-toe upon a little hill,  The air was cooling, and so very still,  That the sweet buds which with a modest pride  Pull droopingly, in slanting curve aside,  Their scantly leaved, and finely tapering stems,  Had not yet lost those starry diadems  Caught from the early sobbing of the morn.""Our Modern Watchwords,"" a rare poem by Winston Churchill, was undoubtedly the auction's biggest disappointment, failing to sell when bids stopped short of estimates. Written on the eve of a naval battle, Churchill's poem is all Queen and country and--while he's certainly no Keats--isn't an embarrassing effort. Here's an except from the poem, which I wrote about in detail in February: The shadow falls along the shore The search lights twinkle on the sea The silence of a mighty fleet Portends the tumult yet to be. The tables of the evening meal Are spread amid the great machines And thus with pride the question runs Among the sailors and marines Breathes there the man who fears to die For England, Home, & Wai-hai-wai.A manuscript of W.H. Auden's heart-wrenching lyric ""Stop All the Clocks,"" made famous by the movie Four Weddings and a Funeral, sold for £23,750 ($36,500), and a hand-edited, typed manuscript of T.S. Eliot's ""Journey of the Magi"" went for £44,450 ($68,000). Eliot's effort isn't your average Christmas poem. It ends with the magi returning from witnessing the birth of Christ:We returned to our palaces, these Kingdoms But no longer at ease here, in the old dispensation, With an alien people clutching their gods. I should be glad of another death.Other highlights of the collection include a rare, handwritten poem by Charlotte Bronte that sold for £92,450 ($142,000), Gerard Manley Hopkins' ""Binary Poplars,"" which fetched £49,250 ($75,721), and Emily Dickinson's ""She Sped as Petals from a Rose,"" which brought in £31,250 ($48,000).You can look through all the auction results at Bonham's website here."

The first thing I always notice when I get off the plane there is the fragrant smell of flowers mixed with the smell of the ocean. To me that is the smell of paradise. And home.My father was incredibly lucky to be born in Honolulu in May 1939 and raised there until he left at 18 to attend Boise State. Family legend has it that on Dec. 7, 1941 his grandmother hoisted him onto the tiny roof of their house in Paloma Valley to watch the unfolding drama at Pearl Harbor. I'm not sure it's true, but the first time I heard that story I secretly both thanked and credited my great-grandma for her spunky nature that I feel fortunate to have inherited. My father passed away in November of 2007, and being in Hawaii reminds me of him. He was a wonderful and kind man; smart, successful and handsome. He taught me most everything I know about business. I miss him terribly and being in Hawaii also reminds me of how much he loved and cherished his home state, even after living in Washington, California and even doing a stint in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. Coming home never fails to remind me of my roots, my family and the important things in life -- for me, nothing is more restorative than being in Hawaii. Time slows there to an imperceptible crawl and life seems to move more with the rhythm of the gentle coming-and-going of the tides. Urgency takes a back seat to a simpler life. There is a concept called ""Hawaiian Time"" which is defined as ""whenever I get around to it."" Although I don't have the space here to catalog every possible beach or attraction, I do want to share a few of the favorite things we did during our 12 days there. We began our trip in Oahu where most of my family resides. My boyfriend, Jim, had never been and being there with him was a treat because it was like seeing everything for the first time. He was fascinated by every sunrise and sunset over the ocean. If I was amenable, we would have raced from shore to shore to catch them daily, but my idea of a vacation is lounging around a bit after sleeping in. However, I do recommend catching at least one sunset from the Banyan Bar at the Moana Hotel in Waikiki beach. Walk through the lobby to be taken back in time to old Hawaii, or sit for a few minutes in a rocker on the balcony. I saw Hanauma Bay with a new perspective. Although they've built up a bit of rigmarole to get into the park (you must view a mandatory video) I think it is worth the time they take to educate people on the potential damage caused to the reef by hundreds of thousands of visitors each year. Coming around the corner to head down to the park I was reminded of the special nature of the place. Although I consider it somewhat ""tourist-y"" and it would not normally be on my to-do list, I was so glad to be able to appreciate its stunning beauty anew. After six days on Oahu -- and many thoughts of ""why did I ever move away and how can I move back"" -- we headed to the airport to spend a week on Kauai. Once there we checked into the Kaha Lani in a beautiful one bedroom condo with unrestricted ocean views. We woke up each morning to a spectacular sunrise. I haven't been to Kauai in a long time and I won't make that mistake again. If you are my boss, please stop reading here because I'd like to surprise you when I walk in and announce I'd like to open a Hawaii office for our company. Or to run a bed and breakfast. Not sure that either will fly but it should be an intriguing conversation.A big first for me on this trip was a scenic ride in a helicopter. I was terrified to go up and had to be forced, dragged and coerced by Jim. He has worked on and been around helicopters a lot and has zero fear of flying. My first helicopter trip a few years ago consisted of being airlifted from Alta Ski Area to the hospital. It was more expensive than the tourist variety and less fun, but that's another story. Other than the almost indescribable scenery, one thing from the trip that will stick with me was the comment from our pilot Captain Jimmy that Kauai is the perfect antidote to the frantic pace of life. The next day we relaxed at Poipu Beach and were treated to swimming with a large sea turtle. A few minutes later we watched an even larger one crawl up onto the beach and create quite a stir. People came running down the beach as the lifeguard roped off an area to give it some peace. We later walked by a beached monk seal. Poipu beach offered great snorkeling, turtle and surfer watching and swimming. The Na Pali coast line begins at Ke'e beach and if you are in great shape, adventurous and seek the greatest views in the world, you can hike 11 miles along the Kalalau Trail. It is one of the most rugged, remote and spectacular places in the world. We had seen the coast line from the helicopter and I wanted to hike the entire 22 miles in and out. You need a permit, supplies and if you are smart, probably a couple of months of training prior to attempting the hike.Hawaii is a magical place. I appreciate it so much more now when I visit than when I lived there. Perhaps scarcity is the ultimate secret to appreciating anything in life but regardless, I'm going to plot, plan and scheme to someday move home. And then never leave."

The primetime television movie special stars Ariel Winter (""Modern Family"") as the voice of Sofia, Sara Ramirez (""Grey's Anatomy"") as her mother, Queen Miranda; Wayne Brady (""Let's Make A Deal"") as Clover, a wise-talking Rabbit; and Tim Gunn (""Project Runway"") as Baileywick, the family's Royal Steward. (AP Photo/Disney Junior)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d0b3326000036007fb631.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If your child asks you for a ""Sofia the First"" DVD, there are some readily available reasons to say ""no."" Maybe you think the first Disney princess aimed at toddlers is steeped in stereotypes and sends the wrong message to girls. Perhaps you remember there was  controversy over whether or not Sofia is Latina. Or, like the father of a boy named Sam, you might just think your kid has too many DVDs.But what happens when a stranger assumes that the reason you are denying ""Sofia the First"" to your little boy is because it's a ""girl movie"" that will make him ""funny""? If you are Sam's dad, you respond to that kind of ignorance in a way that puts you in the running for ""Father of the Year."" On Friday, the following screengrab of Sam's dad telling his story on Facebook shot to the first page of Reddit with that victorious headline.This exchange made many people happy, but ""Sofia the First"" creator Craig Gerber would likely be especially thrilled to read it. In a blog post he wrote for HuffPost last year, Gerber said that he actually made up the character for his son. ""When I tell people about Sofia the First, they are surprised I have two boys and no daughters,"" he wrote. But that's one of the things my children have taught me -- stories resonate when there's something they can relate to.""  Despite any of the aforementioned criticism of the series, Gerber's vision certainly translated into television gold for Disney. ""Sofia"" is a ""ratings monster,"" according to TV Guide, and NBC Latino reported that the premiere of the movie was the top cable telecast of 2012. Likewise, the story of how Sam got his DVD turned into Reddit gold. By Saturday, the image, originally shared by Reddit user propane-accessories, had racked up 990 comments. Our only question is WHO'S taking bids for OLD LADY of the Year nominations?"

Dress to the nines and head to a casino,2013-04-13,Santoo Casami and Jose Lennard dancing the Charleston.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d0b482400003200536e4e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Allie Churchill for YourTango.comThe film adaptation of ""The Great Gatsby"" hits theaters this summer and if Director Baz Luhrmann's latest film is anything like his other colorful, musical love stories (""Moulin Rouge"" and ""Romeo & Juliet"" just to name a few), it's bound to be a blockbuster hit.In case you need a refresher (sans Sparknotes), the novel is set in the summer of 1922 and follows narrator Nick Carraway who rents a small house on Long Island across from the sprawling estate of the enigmatic Jay Gatsby. ""The Great Gatsby"" provides a snapshot into a glorious age in America's history -- the Roaring Twenties -- a time of booming economy, flappers and jazz musicians, bootleggers and gangsters. And it was perhaps the first time in history when Americans truly felt liberated in their sexuality as individuals.But above all else, it's a love story and we fully expect Leonardo DiCaprio and Carey Mulligan to steam up the silver screen as the dashing Jay Gatsby and his love from the past, the darling Daisy Buchanan.So needless to say, it's one of the sexiest books of all time. (Still don’t believe us? Did you know that before he decided on a title, the author considered calling his story ""The High-Bouncing Lover?"")Excited yet? Jazz it up with one of these five date ideas inspired by The Great American Novel. They would make F. Scott Fitzgerald proud.Do The Charleston! Better brush up on those dance shoes -- time to do the Charleston! It was the signature dance move of the '20s. Lively, exuberant and jazzy -- swing moves are enough to get your heart beating and work up a sexy, glistening glow. So take a class in swing dance. Once you've mastered the Charleston, try other dance moves of the era! The Lindy Hop, the Fox Trot or the Jitterbug Jive were also all the rage back in the day. And even if you're stumbling all over each other's feet, don't be discouraged. It's just about having fun. You'll get the hang of the moves and be gliding across the dance floor like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in no time!Ride In Style If you read ""The Great Gatsby,"" you'll remember a car drive that didn't end so well (and if you didn't read it, we won't give away any spoilers), but that doesn't mean you can't still enjoy a ride in style. Automobiles were a must-have luxury in the '20s and yet, only the wealthiest aristocrats drove around in them. So spend an afternoon at an antique car show to see these period cars on display. From the infamous Rolls Royce to the Studebaker Roadster, you can see these classic cars restored to their original shiny glory. And if you have a few hundred dollars to spare, you can rent one for an afternoon ride!Jazz It Up  If The Great Gatsby had a soundtrack, it would most definitely be all about the jazz. During the Roaring Twenties when Prohibition would otherwise put a serious buzz kill on date night, speakeasies became secret underground venues for couples to grab a drink and enjoy some jazzy tunes. And even though speakeasies may be a thing of the past, if your city doesn't have one you can still experience the soul and swagger of jazz music by visiting a swanky jazz club. While you're there, let loose -- jazz is about letting go of inhibitions... and isn't that what a romantic date night out should be about?Mix Like Moonshiners If there was one thing Jay Gatsby was known for, it was his parties: ritzy, extravagant parties full of dancing, debauchery and liquor... lots and lots of liquor. Obviously, bootlegging was a way to get around the booze ban. And while you still can't legally distill a batch of hooch in your bathtub, who says you can't taste the drinks that Daisy and Gatsby clinked glasses to? Stay in for a night and mix highballs, Ward 8 cocktails and Bathtub Gin. To really feel like moonshiners, mix, serve and sip your drinks together under the light of the moon.Place Your Bets With Lady Luck Have a little extra cash? Dress to the nines and head to a casino for date night. Gatsby was all about risk-taking and over-the-top opulence (and he may or may not have been involved with gangsters). So in the spirit of Gatsby, try your luck at the poker, roulette, and blackjack tables. You can pool your chips and gamble together or go head-to-head against one another. As long as you don't end up completely broke by the end of the night, a little gambling can be just the thing to spark excitement between you and your date.More Stories On YourTango:14 Wedding Planning Horror Stories5 Bachelorette Party Ideas That Aren't Cheesy47 Hilarious Wedding Photos 10 Celebrity Sex Tape Scandals You May Have MissedThe Best Sex Position For Female Orgasm [VIDEO]Click through the slideshow below for even more great date ideas.Keep in touch!

And what do they eat? Baguettes, cheese, chocolate. You won't find them sweating it out at a boot camp. Yet they're rail thin. I work out. I rarely eat baguettes, cheese or chocolate (except when on assignment -- I'm a food writer). And like many women, I like to fit into a small pair of jeans. But I wanted it both ways when I spent a week in Paris with two girlfriends last summer. I intended to indulge in the best of the world's food, but still wear my favorite jeans home -- the cutest but most unforgiving pair. So I resolved to tackle a different type of workout every day in Paris, eat everything I wanted, and hope the jeans would fit in both directions over the Atlantic.Paris intervened.I had grand ideas -- rollerblading, running up the stairs in Montmartre, power yoga. My friends wanted to throw in some boxing and ballet. Then? The days overflowing with food and wine and adventures left no room for workouts. To wit: Over a wine-drenched lunch with a couple of expats I took down the number of one's personal trainer; he'd helped her lose 20 pounds. But I never managed to call him.Even worse, I stood up a power yoga class -- I'd signed up because it aligned with my sensibilities as a former power-lifter. The class was set for 9 a.m. Morning, announced by the scent of cigarette smoke drifting into my room from the street, came early. The day before we'd taken a gastronomic stroll with the Paris Greeters program. A volunteer guide led us through a fromagerie, the Poilâne boulangerie, a wine shop and a market to shop for an afternoon-long picnic. We followed this with a jaunt up the stairs at the Eiffel Tower, and bike ride back across the city to collect more provisions for a dinner pique-nique in our apartment. The French music from the staticky little radio led to a late-night dance party in our living room. Even after a restorative coffee I couldn't summon the energy to get to the class in the morning. This was the first time I have ever skipped a workout. Feeling slightly guilty for my last-minute cancellation, we pedaled to the Marais for some shopping before a lengthy private lunch in the tiny La Tête dans les Olives in Belleville. We feasted that night at Philou -- just the kind of chalkboard-menu-on-the-wall bistro I imagine when I dream of Paris. We swapped bites of each course allowing us to each try nine dishes (not to mention the bite of the fig tart the gentleman at the next table insisted I try when I inquired about his dessert).I had one day left to squeeze in a workout and debated even doing that. But all I'd managed to do this week was bike, walk, climb a few stairs, and row a bit around Lac Inférieur at the Bois de Boulogne. And if I'm being honest, even that was just an excuse to eat. We packed a picnic of baguettes, wine in plastic cups with peel-away lids, and macarons. After taking turns rowing a few hundred meters, we gave in to floating and the bliss of our lunch.In fact, I gave in to the bliss every day. I didn't deny myself anything. Macarons were a daily staple. I indulged in the baguettes that I can only dream of at home, pain au chocolate, tender veal sweetbreads, pungent cheeses, dessert every night, wine beginning at lunch and really never stopping, duck, steak, game, even the most deliriously good burger I've ever had the joy to sink my teeth into at L'Atelier du Hamburger Big Fernand.Through all of this I gave myself permission to not surrender a moment's thought to calories. Though I wasn't working out, and was stuffing myself as if I wanted to turn my liver into foie, I felt magnifique. Men complimented our trio nearly, calling out to us as we pedaled by, stopping us on bridges to tell us we were beautiful. In this city of thin and chic women, I felt alluring, eating with abandon as I was, and smiling with unbridled delight all day.In the end I made it to the last-chance workout, mainly because I was too embarrassed to cancel again. One of our trio had an early flight, so my remaining friend Tracy and I made our way to le Jardin Villemin to meet Iain Waite, a personal trainer (whose yoga class I'd skipped). The scent of yesterday's wine wafting from our pores, we began jumping jacks with little enthusiasm. Intensely competitive in fitness at home I just wanted to get through this hour without embarrassing myself. Curious Parisians strolling by stopped to take in our activities.Where was my usual overdrive? I guess it was back home, though not from lack of leadership. Iain was an excellent trainer -- surprising me with new exercises and a good pace. He didn't cut us any slack, and the athlete buried somewhere inside me under the avalanche of macarons could appreciate that.But I was thrilled when the workout ended. It was time to eat. By dinner my pedometer told me I'd walked about 14 kilometers. I doubt that even burned the camembert frit at lunch.Yet the next morning, when it came time to face the truth of the rich food I'd demolished all week, I pulled on my jeans and looked in the mirror. They fit just fine. In fact, they were just a little loose. I think French women have the right idea. Maybe it's time I move to Paris. Feeling happy (and) pretty in Paris.

These students are ""new"" to so many things: language, culture, climate, place, to name just a few. This relationship to newness does wonders to certain individuals. I say certain, because, when conversing with so many lifelong Americans, I'm reminded that not everyone is eager to embrace the challenges, adventures, or opportunities newness affords.For many (if not, most, I'm learning) newness is to be actively avoided. For an increasing number of Americans, not only should newness be avoided, but comfort should be pursued and then controlled. But what if this weren't a value we were imparting on our students, children, and peers? What if we, as a culture, were to drill deep into the core of what made us as a nation and culture great? What if we were to tap into our inner immigrant and take on the challenges of our lives with an immigrant spirit? For starters, we would show up to work, class, appointments, etc. alert and focused more on what's going on as opposed to an electronic box in our pockets or bags because, hey, this stuff is new, we don't want to miss anything. After we soak everything in, we might also double check to make sure we fully understand it and ask questions if we don't. The potential embarrassment or fear of penalty to do something wrong would drive us to make sure we ""get it"" so we can do it right the first time. We'd also be motivated to take full responsibility for our actions and errors because, being ""new"" to a place, we're also a guest. It would be rude to blame a host for our behavior, so we'd on our best. However, this is only the beginning: the foundation for learning, growth, and flourishing. Being ""new"" to a place allows one to see things differently; not just differently, but to pick up nuances that are often taken for granted when seen everyday. Opportunities are spotted where monotony is otherwise assumed. Lack of resources transform into extra time and motivation to refine and develop. And what others have isn't seen as what one deserves, but something one can earn. Our entire nation and culture was and continues to be built by not just immigrants, but the immigrant spirit. Millions upon millions of people with nothing in common other than their shared humanity converged on this continent, not to occupy or to wallow, but to build and pursue as much as their imaginations and energy would allow. This phenomenon hasn't stopped. But it is being ignored by a growing number. What if the success of American individuals and institutions rests in how well they can tap into this immigrant spirit of embracing newness and understanding how to find comfort in being uncomfortable? What if the sustainable strength of this country lies in the fact that it's not a nation, it's an idea? What if this were an idea delivered here by immigrants and the promises of it are being achieved by them? And what if, it were in all of our powers to be immigrants, if not to a place, but this idea?"

As the study states: ""the top one percent in wealth highly overlaps with the top one percent in brains."" More From CNBC:  -- Is Tiger Good for Golf? Not Everyone Thinks So  -- The Masters Economy -- High-End Golf Extravagances  About 45 percent of billionaires are in the top one percent of cognitive ability, the study states. Billionaires were generally smarter than Fortune 500 CEOs, where 38.6 percent were in the top 1 percent of brains. Senators ranked just below that, with 41 percent, along with federal judges 41 percent. Members of the House were less smart, with 21 percent. (The smartest sub group of the American rich and powerful are male Senate Democrats).Even among billionaires, however, there are wide variations in brainpower. Billionaires who made their fortunes from investments and technology were far more likely to be in the top one percent of brains; 69 percent and 63 percent of them were brain-one-percenters. Billionaires who made their money in fashion and retail, as well as food and beverage, were less brainy: with 25 percent and 23 percent of them in the brain elite, respectively.So higher brainpower is not just concentrated at the top: it's concentrated among certain segments of the top.There is one caveat to the theory. The study measures cognitive ability by attendance at 29 selected ""elite colleges,"" which, it says, typically requires high test scores and therefore indicates high intelligence and high IQ. ""Elite college attendance indicates a high general ability level,"" the study says.  But not always. As the study concedes, factors other than test scores and IQ can play a role in admission to elite colleges, like legacy preferences, wealth, sports scholarships and other attributes. And some very smart people don't go to the elite schools for financial or other reasons.An earlier study from a research scientist finds that ""IQ really has no relationship to your wealth.""Still, the Duke study found that fully 88 percent of the Forbes billionaires graduated from college. I guess Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg are more exceptions than the rule. "

A 2011 press release noting London's election as chairman of the non-profit organization asserted that he had been “a pitcher, shortstop and outfielder on the Cal State Northridge baseball team, graduating in 1984.”That statement was later reported as fact by The New York Times and the Financial Times, among other media outlets, in articles about London's arrest.In truth, London never suited up for the Matadors.""There is no record of him ever playing baseball at Cal State Northridge,” Bob Vazquez, assistant athletic director at Cal State Northridge told The Huffington Post. “We checked our old media guides and media statistics. We want back from 1981 to 1986. His name is not listed.”The fact that London did not play baseball for the college was first reported by the Los Angeles Times on Friday.Mark Meyers, a spokesman for the LA Sports Council, confirmed the press release statement had been supplied by London.“That was written a couple of years ago,” Meyers told The Huffington Post. “No one has found it interesting until now.”London this week resigned from his post with the non-profit organization, Meyers said.London’s lawyer, Harland Braun, confirmed that the details of his client's supposed collegiate baseball career were false.“I asked him about the baseball thing,” Braun said, “He says he tried out and never made it. It was a mistake. I didn’t ask him how it was a mistake.“He has a lifetime of other problems,” Braun added. “This is an aberration.”According to Bloomberg, London plans to plead guilty to the insider trading charge at his next court date on May 17. He would face up to five years in prison and a fine of $250,000.“I regret my actions in leaking nonpublic data to a third party,” London said in a statement Tuesday. “What I have done was wrong and against everything that I had believed in.” "

Income in its biggest businesses - investment banking and consumer lending - fell, excluding accounting adjustments. Outstanding loans grew by just 1 percent, and profit margins on lending narrowed. Stock and bond trading revenue fell.Every bank chief executive suffers from similar headwinds, but Dimon is also facing a shareholder vote next month at JPMorgan's annual meeting that could push the board to strip him of his chairman's role. A group of investors behind the proposal says the bank needs to separate the roles of chairman and CEO so that the board can provide more oversight of management.That follows a similar proposal in 2012 and comes after the bank posted $6.2 billion of derivatives losses last year that came to be known as the ""London whale"" trades. The losses were recorded by an investment office whose head reported to Dimon.JPMorgan's stock has lost some of the premium valuation it used to enjoy over the shares of other big banks.Worse still for Dimon, the bank's relationship with regulators has deteriorated in recent years, and JPMorgan's board blames that in part on the CEO, two sources familiar with the matter said.""If the board wants to send a message that they want to restore regulatory confidence in the company, it will name an independent chairman,"" said Michael Garland, who oversees corporate governance for New York City Comptroller John Liu, one of the pension fund investors backing the shareholder proposal.Garland said the trading loss showed that Dimon needed better oversight from his board of directors.Dimon was not available for comment.STRONG SUPPORTWhile Dimon's reputation as one of the best risk managers in the business may have taken a hit, and his pay was cut in half for 2012, he still has strong support from investors and the bank's directors. JPMorgan's board, for example, said last month that it ""strongly endorses"" keeping Dimon as both CEO and chairman.""I think he's safe,"" said Alan Villalon, a senior research analyst at Nuveen Asset Management, which has $120 billion of assets and owns JPMorgan shares.Dimon has been working to repair his relationship with regulators as well. In his annual letter to shareholders this week, he said, ""I feel terrible that we let our regulators down."" Getting control of the company's compliance systems is the firm's top priority, he said.Still, Dimon has signaled that the loss of his chairmanship may make him feel far from comfortable. He told analysts in February he would not have agreed to become CEO of Bank One, which was later bought by JPMorgan, if he could not have been chairman too.""Troubled company, big turnaround, divided board. Not me. Life is too short,"" Dimon said at the time.To Dimon's supporters, the London whale episode underscores his abilities as a manager. In spite of losing more than $6 billion on the trades, the bank posted record profits last year.""I would hope, as a shareholder, that we see him running the institution as long as I hold the shares,"" said Kevin O'Keefe, financial services analyst at Brown Advisory, which manages $33 billion of institutional and high net worth assets. PRESSURE INCREASESThe extent of the dysfunction between JPMorgan and regulators was revealed in a report last month by a U.S. Senate subcommittee, which was probing the trading losses. According to the report, JPMorgan browbeat one of its main regulators, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.In one episode outlined in the report, Dimon declined to provide a daily trading statement to the OCC because he feared the regulator was leaking some of the data.When Doug Braunstein, the bank's chief financial officer at the time, resumed giving the information to regulators, Dimon shouted at him, according to the report.A JPMorgan spokeswoman said at the time, ""While we have repeatedly acknowledged mistakes, our senior management acted in good faith and never had any intent to mislead anyone.""Last month, the Federal Reserve also told JPMorgan to fix flaws in the way it determines how much capital the bank can return to shareholders. In its stress testing of major banks, the Fed said JPMorgan could increase its quarterly dividend to 38 cents a share from 30 cents, and buy back $6 billion of its shares. [ID:nL1N0C6INQMeanwhile, the opposition to Dimon's dual roles at the bank has grown.The proposal to split the chairman and CEO roles last year received 40.1 percent of votes cast.Since that vote, which happened only five days after the company first acknowledged losing billions of dollars on the trades, shareholders have learned much more about the company's failed risk controls and the trouble it has had with regulators. More investors have joined the call for the splitting of the roles.Last year, the only sponsor of the proxy measure calling for Dimon to lose his chairman's position was a public union pension plan, the American Federation of State, County & Municipal Employees.This year, New York City and state of Connecticut employee retirement plans and Hermes Fund Managers from the United Kingdom have joined in.The additional sponsors increase the chances the measure will pass, said Lisa Lindsley, AFSCME's director of capital strategies. The annual meeting is set for May 21 in Tampa, Florida.The bank's earnings on Friday could lend further support to those dissenting voices.JPMorgan posted $6.53 billion of net income for the first quarter, a 33 percent jump from the same quarter last year, but much of that gain came from accounting judgments rather than increased customer demand.The bank recorded essentially no litigation expenses in the first quarter, compared with about $2.5 billion for the same period last year. It put aside less money to cover credit losses and drew down on reserves to cover bad loans - all of which boosted profits in the quarter but led some analysts to question the sustainability of earnings growth.Another reason for better profit this quarter: the London Whale losses from the bank's big trades in credit derivatives markets are largely over.""The London Whale was the stupidest and most embarrassing situation I have ever been a part of,"" Dimon said in his annual letter.

Nobel Prize-winning economist Paul Krugman said last month that Bank of England Governor Mervyn King had 'stepped way over the line' and become a 'cheerleader' for the government's deficit-cutting plans.

The Nobel Prize-winning economist wrote in a blog post Friday that famed economist Adam Smith would have “scorned” bitcoins because “mining” them requires expending real resources. Smith criticized the use of gold and silver currency in the 18th century, arguing that valuable resources were being expended to create something that was simply symbolic. Krugman writes that the same can be said of bitcoins. “Now here we are in a world of high information technology -- and people think it’s smart, nay cutting-edge, to create a sort of virtual currency whose creation requires wasting real resources in a way Adam Smith considered foolish and outmoded in 1776,” he wrote in the Friday post. Bitcoins are a form of internet currency accepted by some websites to purchase actual goods. The internet money isn't backed by any national government, though. The coins popularity have grown in recent weeks and the total value of outstanding bitcoins surpassed $1 billion earlier this month. Users can buy the coins or “mine” them by running high-level computer programs that take up a lot of memory space and have a slim chance of producing any actual coins. Despite skepticism from Krugman and others, the currency is gaining traction among investors and internet geeks. The Winklevoss twins, best known for their legal battle with Mark Zuckerberg over Facebook, claimed last week to own about 1 percent of all the bitcoins in existence -- a sum reportedly worth about $11 million. In addition, a family in Texas claimed they sold a Porsche for 300 bitcoins earlier this month.  "

But because Lyft and Sidecar have continued to operate without licenses in several cities, Kalanick said, Uber would also compete with them until they were shut down or regulated.""In most cities around the country there are stiff citations for doing what is called ride sharing as well as the potential for criminal misdemeanor,"" Kalanick said.""We're sort of taking cue in terms of, if they want to enforce, that's something they should do before a bunch of companies roll out services.""Kalanick said he was considering New York, Chicago, Boston, Seattle and California among the markets where he would launch UberX Rideshare.Terrie Prosper, a spokeswoman for the California Public Utilities Commission, could not immediately comment on Uber's new service.In recent months, the company has taken steps to settle its disputes with authorities. The California Public Utilities Commission, for instance, lifted its cease-and-desist order earlier this year and Uber has been allowed to operate its black car service on an interim basis until the commission determines a set of permanent regulations.But in copying Sidecar and Lyft, Uber could risk antagonizing local authorities which have generally been more skeptical of services that involve private individuals who may not hold commercial insurance policies but moonlight as cab drivers.Sidecar has been locked in a lawsuit against the city of Austin, Texas, where it has continued to operate after the city council passed a law earlier this year banning the service. The company has also defied the Philadelphia Parking Authority, which has tried unsuccessfully to shut it down.Sidecar's spokeswoman Margaret Ryan declined to comment Friday, but its chief executive, Sunil Paul, has repeatedly argued that the company merely helps match willing drivers with those who want a ride, and is therefore not running a transportation service.(Reporting By Gerry Shih; Editing by Daniel Magnowski)"
