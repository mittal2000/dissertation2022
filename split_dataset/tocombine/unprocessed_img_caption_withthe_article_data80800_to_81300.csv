(Reuters) - The White House announced a new strategy on Monday to tackle the explosion in heroin use in a collection of eastern states, focusing on treating addicts rather than punishing them and targeting high-level suppliers for arrest.The move is a response to a sharp rise in the use of heroin and opiate-based painkillers, which the U.S. Centers for Disease Control has described as an epidemic.Heroin use has more than doubled among people aged 18-25 in the United States in the past decade, according to CDC figures, while overdose death rates have nearly quadrupled. An estimated 45 percent of U.S. heroin users are also addicted to prescription painkillers.Announcing the 'Heroin Response Strategy' on Monday, Michael Botticelli, Director of National Drug Control Policy, said the new plan will address the heroin and painkiller epidemics as both ""a public health and a public safety issue.""Under the plan, $2.5 million of $13.4 million in new funding to combat drug trafficking will target regions the White House said are facing a severe heroin threat: Appalachia, New England, New York, New Jersey, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C. and Baltimore.The Obama administration will work with local law enforcement to increase access to treatment for addicts and try to trace the sources of heroin trafficking.The policy is in line with new criminal justice strategies that seek to treat more drug offenders as addicts within the public health system rather than as criminals who must serve long sentences in jail.Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio and Democrat Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island have pushed for such policies for more than a year in Congress.(Reporting By Julia Edwards; Editing by Bill Rigby)Also on HuffPost:"

Mark Tiller to be released. Supporters also called for local prosecutor Chrissy Adams to be taken off the case, The Greenville News reported, citing frustration over what they see as a lack of urgency on her part.""We haven't seen any evidence that she intends to prosecute Lt. Tiller,"" Hammond's mother, Angie, said of Adams. ""Why is anything more important to her than the video? Release the video.""Hammond's relatives and their attorneys have suggested that dashcam video captured by Tiller's cruiser may provide more insight into what led to their son's death on the evening of July 26. But investigators have refused requests from the Hammonds and local media outlets to release the footage, saying they are ""sensitive law enforcement records"" which could harm an ongoing investigation.Seneca police say Tiller approached Hammond's vehicle to make an arrest in a drug deal that a passenger in the car had set up with an undercover officer. The passenger, 23-year-old Tori Morton, was ultimately charged with misdemeanor marijuana possession. Tiller's lawyer has said the coroner found ""a white powdery substance consistent with powder cocaine"" on Hammond's body.Tiller's lawyer has maintained that Hammond refused an order to show his hands and instead drove his vehicle toward Tiller, causing the officer to fear for his life and fire at Hammond in self defense. Multiple autopsy reports, however, have shown that the bullets struck Hammond in the back and side, leading his parents to claim that the shooting was unlawful.""Zach didn't do anything to deserve two bullets in his back,"" Hammond's mother said Saturday. ""No one has been able to explain how and why this happened.""Nonviolence advocate Jack Logan organized Saturday's rally, which also included speeches by a state senator, professors from Clemson University and activists, local TV station WIS News 10 reported. ""I never would have called a rally like this if the mayor and the chief had done their job,"" Logan said.He went on to criticize members of the city council, whom Hammond's parents have criticized for remaining silent in the wake of their son's death.""There's enough people out here today to get those people out of office,"" Logan said, according to The Greenville News. ""What are they trying to hide? ... There's something wrong in this town and it's called transparency with this sorry police department.""The Department of Justice announced last week that it had opened a parallel civil rights probe into Hammond's case, following a request by his family. Lawyers representing the family then wrote a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch and FBI director James Comey, obtained by local TV station WHNS, claiming that a witness had seen an officer lift up Hammond's corpse and place something underneath. The unnamed witness also said he'd seen Seneca police officers pick up Hammond's hand to “high-five” him after he was killed.For nearly a week after his death, the Hammond story went largely unnoticed, both by the national media and the mostly white town of Seneca. The initial silence led many, including his family and their attorneys, to question if the case had been treated differently from recent police killings of black teenagers because both Hammond and the officer are white. After supporters of the Black Lives Matter movement began calling attention to Hammond's death on social media, the story began to attract attention from national outlets, including The New York Times, CNN and The Washington Post.Reports from the rally on Saturday show a racially diverse crowd attended. While activists and supporters spoke of Hammond's life specifically, they made it clear that they viewed his tragic death as a consequence of the same controversial police behavior that has led to nationwide protests over the past year, often centered around the killings of black suspects by white officers.“All lives matter,” said state Sen. Karl Allen (D), who is black. “As a part of that, the life of Zach Hammond matters enough to get true and accurate answers.”For more from The Huffington Post, download our app for iOS or Android."

John McCain while holding a small card protesting the sale of Native holy land to mining interests.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55d238fb170000b700567b14.jpeg?ops=crop_8_173_520_587%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Adriano Tsinigine, 17, wore his finest traditional jewelry -- a turquoise necklace, stamped silver and turquoise bowguard, and watch -- for the Navajo Code Talker Day festivities in Window Rock, Arizona, this past Friday. He was there partly to honor his late great-grandfather Wilford Buck, a Navajo code talker who served during World War II.But the high school senior also wanted to make a political statement -- about Congress' sale of Oak Flat, a section of Arizona's Tonto National Forest that Apache consider holy land, to foreign mining conglomerates.After the parade and gathering of state and tribal leaders -- who included Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) and Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye -- Tsinigine noticed that people were crowding around the politicians to pose for grip-and-grin photos.""I thought, OK, here's my chance,"" Tsinigine told The Huffington Post on Monday during his lunch break at the Navajo Preparatory School in Farmington, New Mexico. He asked McCain for a photo, and just as the senator was putting on his best politician's grin, Tsinigine produced a card that read, ""PROTECT OAK FLAT.""Tsinigine said he offered to let McCain keep the card, but the senator refused.""You have to leave,"" McCain, clearly unhappy, said as he pushed the card back into the young man's chest. Tsinigine chuckled and walked away. The senator has been the target of intense criticism by Native activists and their supporters after adding a rider this past December onto the National Defense Authorization Act that opened the Apache holy land to mining conglomerates Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton.The photo of McCain posing with an Oak Flat protester and a short video of the exchange have gone viral. ""I was hoping to get a photo of at least McCain ... or one of the Arizona representatives"" in order to help raise awareness about the struggle to save Oak Flat, Tsinigine said.The photo-op was just one part of a particularly unwelcoming visit for McCain to Window Rock, the Navajo Nation capital.The senator, who has been a supporter of corporate mining interests, also encountered protesters chanting, ""Water is life!"" in the Navajo language and waving a banner that read, ""John McCain = Indian Killer."" The protesters voiced concerns about water rights, especially following last week's Gold King Mine disaster, which contaminated the San Juan River with heavy metals -- including lead, arsenic and copper -- and continues to threaten the lives and livelihoods of many on the already parched Navajo reservation.The protesters shouting, ""Get off our land!"" ran after McCain's vehicle as it left town.The Phoenix New Times, which first reported the story, characterized the encounter as McCain being ""chased off the Navajo Nation"" by protesters. However, McCain's office disputed the veracity of that headline.""[McCain] certainly wasn't 'chased off' the reservation,'"" a spokesman for the senator's office told the Arizona newspaper. ""This small group of young protesters had no practical impact on his productive meetings with top tribal leaders on a range of key issues, including the EPA's recent Gold King Mine spill which threatens to contaminate the Navajo Nation's water supply. Senator McCain was also extremely proud to help honor the Navajo Code Talkers on behalf of all Arizonans -- their heroic service saved countless American and allied lives during World War II."" "
6,POLITICS,Behind The Movement To Repeal California's Worst Law,"Judith Lewis Mernit, Capital & Main",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/behind-the-movement-to-repeal-californias-worst-law_us_55d22acbe4b055a6dab10187,"Twenty years later, a law spurred by ""welfare queen"" panic is still on the books. California State Sen. Holly Mitchell is trying to change that.",2015-08-17,<p>California State Sen. Holly Mitchell (D-Los Angeles)</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=KLbeMHqw50&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This story originally appeared in Capital & Main.Sign up for email alerts from Capital & Main.Vivian Thorp was 28 years old when she ripped a ligament in her knee lifting heavy freight at Walmart in Vallejo, California. Until then, she’d liked her job and was good at it. “I was always strong and agile, and I had the skills for a physical job,” she says. “I helped set up that store.” But when the injury laid her up, she found herself adrift in the job market. “I wasn’t skilled for anything else other than waitressing or shipping and receiving,” she says. “I got really deeply depressed.”Her life began to unravel. A bank repossessed the rental she was living in. The father of her baby daughter Jasmine, born in 1994, left Thorp and returned to England. In 1997, four years after the accident, Walmart finally paid her $20,000 for medical expenses and lost income, but more than half of it went to pay back workers’ compensation. In debt, homeless and with a small child to support, in 1999 Thorp sought the help of California’s welfare program, CalWORKs.She didn’t stay on welfare long; after only about a year she found a job as an office manager with a security company. But she was pregnant with her second child, conceived in a relationship with a homeless man who struggled with alcoholism and mental illness. “It wasn’t a planned pregnancy,” she says, “but it was a blessing.” Within six months, however, the owner of the security firm died, and all his employees lost their jobs. One month before she gave birth, Thorp went back on welfare: $520 a month for herself and Jasmine.Thorp had assumed that when her second daughter, Janina, was born, her monthly cash aid payments would rise by another $122 to cover the child. This small sum might have qualified her for subsidized housing— even “Section 8 OK” apartments have income requirements. It also would have paid for diapers and a few extra groceries when food stamps ran out. She was “devastatingly shocked,” then, to learn of California’s Maximum Family Grant rule, which states that women who have babies while already on welfare may not be entitled to an increase in benefits.“I didn’t understand it,” Thorp says. “I was trying to do all the right things.” With no help from the baby’s father, and an income so meager even subsidized housing refused to rent to her, Thorp moved her family into an abandoned building in Oakland.“It was filthy, the bathroom was outside, and there was lead paint peeling off the walls,” she remembers. She resorted to stealing diapers and food. “Those were dark, dark days.”California’s Maximum Family Grant law is an example of “family cap” welfare restrictions, a relic of a 1990s-era conservative belief that women were deliberately having more babies just to rake in more benefits, anointing themselves “welfare queens.” California Republican Party chairman Jim Brulte, then his party’s Assembly leader, pushed such a law through the legislature in 1994, when states still needed waivers from the federal government to impose these restrictions. Two years later, with the federal welfare program’s overhaul, states were relieved of the waiver requirement. Similar laws remain on the books in 15 states.This year, State Senator Holly Mitchell, (D-Los Angeles), introduced Senate Bill 23, a repeal of the Maximum Family Grant rule, on the grounds that it has only driven poor women deeper into poverty, and done nothing to reduce the birth rate of women on welfare. That assertion has been supported by several studies, including one from the University of California, Berkeley and another from Cornell University. Such caps can, at least theoretically, motivate a woman to have an abortion, which is why Minnesota Citizens Concerned for Life in 2013 formed a rare alliance with Democratic Farmer-Labor legislators to repeal that state’s decade-old family cap rule. Anti-abortion and anti-reproductive rights groups in California, however, have been less magnanimous. With the exception of the bishops of the California Catholic Conference, none have stepped up to support Mitchell’s bill.That’s not simply because the conservative members of “right-to-life” groups in California shrink from joining forces with a liberal, Mitchell insists. “If I had a single inkling it was a Holly Mitchell issue with them, Holly Mitchell’s name would be off it in an instant,” she tells Capital & Main. “I’ve had Republican support on all kinds of issues.” Instead, the conservatives’ hang-up over repealing the Maximum Family Grant rule “is all about the price tag.” The Assembly Committee on Human Services estimates that providing aid to the 134,900 children currently excluded from CalWORKs due to the Maximum Family Grant rule — 13 percent of the all children in CalWORKs households — will cost between $188 million and $220 million. That’s a lot of money for certain Republican lawmakers, even if they oppose abortion. “The very same people who will stand on the floor of the Assembly and espouse their anti-choice rhetoric are the same people who don’t support minimum wage [increases],” Mitchell says. “I refuse to call them ‘pro-life.’ I am pro-life. I am pro-feeding, housing and educating children. That’s what I call pro-life.”This is not the first year Mitchell has floated a repeal of the Maximum Family Grant law. Twice before, she has authored bills that failed. Jessica Bartholow, legislative advocate for the Western Center on Law and Poverty, remembers last year’s fight as especially heartbreaking.“The hearing was on July 3, the 20th anniversary of the bill’s passing,” she remembers. “It was only going to be a half-day in the Senate because of the Fourth of July parades.” Bartholow had spent two years working on the law’s repeal and was emboldened by a successful effort to block a similar law’s passage in Pennsylvania. She knew Mitchell’s bill had bipartisan support, so when an off-the-floor appropriations hearing was called, she let herself get excited. “I had a little hope in my heart,” she says. “I thought, ‘Wouldn’t this be great if they surprise us on the anniversary?’”But when she threw open the door of the committee room, she saw a familiar, disheartening sight.“When you see business lobbyists with their feet on the table, you know they’re getting exactly what they want.” They were: The committee was about to offer a $420 million tax break to Boeing subcontractor Lockheed Martin as a way to sweeten Boeing’s federal bid to build next-generation bombers.“Nobody asked how many jobs they’d create, or whether they’d be middle-class jobs,” says Bartholow. “They didn’t have to show studies, they didn’t have to bring in any analysis. I thought, ‘A single company gets $420 million, and a woman has to come in and prove she’s [been] raped to get $122 a month?’ It was one of my saddest days at the Capitol.”Mitchell isn’t sure 2015 will be different. Though the Senate approved the repeal, it was removed from the budget deal Governor Jerry Brown signed in June. The bill goes before the Assembly Appropriations Committee on Wednesday, where Mitchell worries lawmakers will want a watered-down version — one that requires women prove they’ve used birth control, for instance. (“What other public benefit program requires that you divulge to someone other than your health-care provider or partner what sort of birth control you’re using?” she asks.) Nor will she exclude from the repeal coverage for children who have been already been denied benefits. “If we do that we do that, we leave 40,000 without benefits in Los Angeles County alone.”But repeal is long overdue, she insists. “It’s an antiquated policy based on a flawed hypothesis,” she says, “this racist, classist, sexist notion of the ‘welfare queen.’ You can’t be a welfare queen on $400 a month. I’m embarrassed to see this policy continues to be in our code.”As it turned out, Thorp was illegally denied cash aid for Janina. The exclusion doesn’t apply to babies whose mothers have gone without CalWORKs’ aid for two months or more during their pregnancies, and Thorp had worked full time for six months during her pregnancy. She spent two years fighting Janina’s exclusion with the help of the East Bay Community Law Center. By the time she won two years later, she was pregnant again.“That time they just said, ‘You know the rules,’” Thorp remembers, even though she insisted she’d become pregnant while on birth control pills. Contraceptive failure is one of the exemptions from the family cap rule, along with rape (as long as a police report has been filed) and incest. But only certain kinds of birth control — an intrauterine device, Norplant or sterilization — qualify. Thorp raised her third daughter, Zosia, now 12, without any extra help from CalWORKs. She nevertheless managed to earn an undergraduate degree in public policy from the now-defunct New College of California, and works full time as an advocate for the Homeless Action Center in the Bay Area.People might ask, and some do, why Thorp continued having children she couldn’t support. But this kind of question glosses over the deeply ingrained complexities of why women have children at all. Thorp chafes at the images of fundamentalist conservatives on television crowing about their large families. “If you’re a wealthy Christian family you can have 19 children, but if you’re a poor single mother, you’re not supposed to have two.“I got pregnant in the first place because I believed in having a family,” says Thorp, who is Catholic and unwilling to have an abortion. “I had a lot of hope and happiness for us. But now when I look at pictures of parents enjoying their babies, I envy them. My years of raising my kids were fogged out with despair.”"

One aspect of the article that stuck out to several media outlets (including this one) was the fact that it included 21 instances of someone falling off a frat house. However, the problem of students, usually intoxicated, falling from high places and being injured or killed is not unique to fraternities.In cases where alcohol or drugs were suspected to play a role, young people have died falling from 10 stories, from nine stories, seven stories, five stories, four stories and three stories. If you're lucky enough to fall from the second story, you might not be killed, but you could be injured. Then again, falling two floors could still kill you. A website called compelledtoact.com, maintained by the family of a student who died in an alcohol-related snowmobile accident, lists dozens of examples of American students falling to their death while drinking. Students have died falling from balconies at parties outside the U.S. as well. ""It's a question of using your head -- but that's part of the problem when it comes to alcohol, is that you lose the ability to do that,"" said George Koob, Ph.D, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. ""You just have to be careful about exposing yourself to physical harm by accident because of the motor coordination and the disinhibitory effects.""One 2009 study looked at students ages 18-24 who died from falls over a three-year period. Two-thirds of that group, or 386 students, died from alcohol-related falls.The numbers may not be massive, but given that most, if not all, of these deaths are preventable, they represent a problem.Sometimes it's not falling from a balcony, dorm or frat house window, it's falling from climbing something you shouldn't -- like the University of Arizona student who died last year climbing a tower. The point is that in the vast majority of these cases, the students were intoxicated, and someone could've stopped them from risking their physical safety.Nicole May fell from a third-story balcony after drinking at a dorm at the University of California, San Diego, in 2014. She broke several bones, including all of her right ribs, and had a collapsed lung. ""Right after my accident and I was released from the hospital, I started to hear about several different balcony and roof related falls,"" May told The Huffington Post. ""It was scary because in all of those cases the person died. I didn't.""May still questions why no one stopped her from going out on the balcony after drinking, but doesn't blame anyone for her accident. Instead, she hopes others learn from her experience. She survived, thankfully, but it took her months to recover, as she described in a mini-documentary:""It's natural to warn someone if they are getting too close to a ledge, but at the same time no one actually thinks that you or someone you know would actually fall,"" May said. ""I think it's important for people to care and warn those who can't make the best decisions for themselves because we would want someone to take care of us, too.""As University of Missouri Wellness Resource Center Director Kim Dude explained, ""If somebody drinks to the point of intoxication, they're not going to consciously think, 'OK, this is a dangerous thing I’m about to do.' That's all the more reason to have somebody sober there.""Obviously, all of these things could happen off campus, to people of any age. You don't have to be drinking to put yourself in a risky situation where you're a little too close to the edge of a balcony. But given that getting hammered has become so closely associated with the American college experience, there are more opportunities to put yourself at risk. So please, college students, watch out for your friends. Don't let them goof around on a roof or next to the edge of a balcony when they've been drinking. Julia Bush contributed reporting."
15,POLITICS,Aide Speaks Out About Michigan Tea Party Reps Who Covered Up Affair,Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/todd-courser-cindy-gamrat-affair_us_55d241e4e4b0ab468d9e0ff4,“It was like working with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.”,2015-08-17,<p>The two Michigan state representatives are being investigated in the wake of their affair.</p>,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55c7fed91d00006e00144487.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- A former aide to two Michigan state representatives who allegedly instructed their staff to cover up their affair described a stressful office culture in which he “was constantly on edge and began to feel anxiety.”In a news conference on Monday, Josh Cline accused his former bosses, Republican state Reps. Todd Courser and Cindy Gamrat, of creating a “hostile and untenable work environment in which I was required to turn a blind eye toward the improper behavior in Rep. Courser and Gamrat’s office.”Cline was the legislative director for both Courser and Gamrat, and began to suspect that the two were having an affair when they frequently canceled and rescheduled staff meetings and spent a lot of time in Gamrat’s office, or would leave the office to go on long walks. Though Cline worked more closely with Courser, the representatives shared a lot of the same staff. Cline said that they “showed a complete disrespect toward me and other staffers.”The two lawmakers attended most meetings together, Cline said, unless the meeting was specifically with a constituent from their respective districts. Courser was openly affectionate with Gamrat, complimenting her appearance and passionately embracing her, the former aide said. He also said that Courser often took naps in Gamrat's office, and Gamrat would bring him a pillow and ""tuck him in.""When Cline tried to intervene, they rebuffed his efforts.“I suggested that they should adopt and enforce personal boundaries. They quickly dismissed my concerns and suggested that such a request was beyond my duty as a staffer,” he said.In April, citing the disrespect and stress that he felt, Cline took his concerns to the state house speaker’s office and submitted his resignation.“It is not an easy task to choose integrity over a paycheck,” he said.Gamrat’s husband discovered the affair in February, when he caught the two lawmakers at a hotel, Cline said.In May, Courser allegedly instructed another staffer, Ben Graham, to send an anonymous email planting a fake gay sex scandal involving Courser. The lawmaker admitted that he hoped the email would draw attention away from his affair with Gamrat. Graham refused to send the email, and was later fired.Cline said he considered Courser a close friend before they began working in the Michigan House of Representatives, and alleged that Courser “adopted a disrespectful and haughty attitude toward staffers” after taking office in January.“He would remind us, ‘Let’s get it straight, boys. We’re not here to pass legislation. We’re here for messaging and media,’” Cline recounted. “It was like working with Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.”He could not comment on whether Courser and Gamrat improperly used taxpayer money to conduct or cover up their affair. The House Business Office is investigating the matter, and Cline said he wanted to speak with investigators before commenting on more specifics about the inquiry.Both representatives insist that they will not resign, and Gamrat has denied playing a role in the cover-up.Courser and Gamrat are tea party conservatives who ousted establishment favorites last year.

Press advocates have denounced the case against Ryan J. Reilly of The Huffington Post and Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post.But local law enforcement apparently sees more here than meets the eye -- that is, a couple of reporters not exiting McDonald's as quickly as the police wished. The 33-page police report associated with the incident asserts that the journalists' ""unlawful actions"" at McDonald's ""directly contributed"" to the civil unrest in Ferguson last August. That document, which was written by the St. Louis County Police Department more than six months after the fact, goes to great lengths to establish the presence of the New Black Panther Party -- as well as various anarchists and communists -- not actually in the McDonald's, but in the general area at the time. ""Incident Command determined it would be prudent to warn the citizenry"" that ""the presence of members of a known domestic terrorist group"" would hamper police response to 911 calls, the report states.The civil unrest in Ferguson, as you may recall, followed a police officer shooting and killing an unarmed black man. Not long before Reilly and Lowery were arrested, police were pointing sniper rifles at peaceful protesters in broad daylight.The two reporters, who were covering the protests and the police response, argue the charges are ridiculous.""We've been out here discussing this in part because it's so ridiculous and also in part because for so long they wouldn't give us any police report, they wouldn't give us any information,"" Lowery said on HuffPost's ""So, That Happened"" podcast late last week. Scroll to 24:20 in the podcast to hear the interview:Reilly finally obtained the police report and its claims of a domestic terrorist threat last week. ""This sounds like an FBI file from the 1960s,"" he said on the podcast.The police report also stresses that the manager of the McDonald's wanted the police to hassle his customers. McDonald's manager Keith Eyer ""agreed the restaurant should close for the safety of all concerned and requested the assistance of the police department in asking the remaining patrons to leave the premise.""Lowery doubts that's true from his own observations that day. ""What seems more likely in terms of the way police were behaving during that time is they came in and said, 'Listen, we're going to close your restaurant down,'"" Lowery said. ""And the manager said, 'OK, whatever, guys.'""McDonald's Corporation said on Twitter that it didn't ask for anyone to be arrested. That should be harder for prosecutors to argue that Reilly and Lowery were trespassing in a private establishment if the establishment didn't want them to leave.Not that Reilly and Lowery refused to leave. The main problem alleged was that they just weren't moving fast enough for the officers on the scene.""Rather than pack his belongings to leave, Mister Reilly simply moved his belongings around in an inefficacious manner,"" the report says. ""Officer [Michael] McCann then packed Mister Reilly's bag for him in a further effort to assist him in leaving the restaurant. When it became apparent that Mister Reilly was not going to leave as directed, Officer McCann placed Mister Reilly under arrest for trespassing.""One detail the report omits: Reilly said that while he was handcuffed, the officer slammed his head into a window and then sarcastically apologized for it.Likewise, Lowery allegedly lollygagged when police told him to stop his legal video recording of their interaction and leave the McDonald's.""While Mister Lowery did not cease to record, he did begin to move, though slowly,"" the report says. ""Mister Lowery turned and began to walk past the soda machines as if it was his intention to leave through the north door. However, when he reached the soda machine, he attempted to put his bag down and stopped. He then directed his recording in the direction of Officer McCann and Mister Reilly, indicating that he was not going to leave the restaurant.""Jonathan Peters, an attorney and press freedom correspondent for the Columbia Journalism Review, called the charges ""bullshit.""The Huffington Post similarly considers the charges outrageous. ""A crime was committed at the McDonald's, not by journalists, but by local police who assaulted both Ryan and Wesley Lowery of The Washington Post during violent arrests,"" D.C. bureau chief Ryan Grim and senior politics editor Sam Stein said in an earlier statement.Reilly and Lowery have a hearing scheduled in their trespassing case next week.This podcast was produced and edited by Adriana Usero and engineered by Brad Shannon, with assistance from Christine Conetta.To listen to this podcast later, download our show on iTunes.
