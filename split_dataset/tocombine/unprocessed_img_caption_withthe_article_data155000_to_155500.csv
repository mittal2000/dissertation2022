Emotional regulation,2013-05-13,"vintage colored young brunette relaxing in the summer, under the tree",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d28972100003100c567c0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"How you deal with both positive and negative emotions could have big implications for your mental health. Emotional regulation -- whether you avoid your emotions, or explore them -- may play a role in how much, and whether, you suffer from anxiety, according to a new University of Illinois study. The findings, recently published in the journal Emotion, are based on survey responses from 179 healthy adult men and women. The participants answered questionnaires asking them how they managed their emotions and how anxious they felt in various situations. Researchers found that the participants who utilized an emotional strategy called ""reappraisal"" -- that is, looking at the situation or issue in a new light -- had less social anxiety and less severe general anxiety than those who suppress their feelings. “When something happens, you think about it in a more positive light, a glass half full instead of half empty,” graduate student and researcher Nicole Llewellyn said in a University press release. “You sort of reframe and reappraise what’s happened and think what are the positives about this? What are the ways I can look at this and think of it as a stimulating challenge rather than a problem?”Emotional strategy can benefit not only mental health, but physical health as well. Research published earlier this month in the journal Psychological Science found that emotional regulation and generating positive feelings can be an important ""psychological nutrient"" in building good bodily health. “People tend to liken their emotions to the weather, viewing them as uncontrollable,” researcher Barbara Fredrickson, Ph.D., of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, wrote in that study. “This research shows not only that our emotions are controllable, but also that we can take the reins of our daily emotions and steer ourselves toward better physical health.”One strategy that may be effective in enhancing emotional stability is maintaining a mindfulness meditation practice, according to other recent research. That study found that mindful personality traits are associated not only with less moodiness, but also with improved sleep quality -- which may be especially beneficial considering sleep deprivation has been shown to increase anxiety by driving up the brain's anticipatory reactions.Managing emotions may be challenging, but it's certainly possible. An extensive body of research shows that thought patterns and emotional regulation can be controlled. To learn to regulate your own emotions, stress expert and HuffPost blogger Paula Davis-Laack recommends working with your thought patterns to make them more flexible, accurate and thorough when identifying what's working. These three things, she posits, can help you to reduce stress and anxiety, and increase well-being.  "

They could also be lowering the risk of bipolar disorder in their offspring.Researchers at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City compared 214 people who had been born to women who had flu while pregnant with 722 healthy controls, all born in the early 1960s. They found that those whose moms had flu during pregnancy were four times more likely to develop bipolar than the healthy controls - but their risk, while higher, was still very small.More from Everyday Health: Man's Best Friend May Be the Heart's Best Friend Too Living Near Busy Roads May Up Diabetes Risk in Children Exercise Ups 'Good' Estrogen, Cuts Breast Cancer Odds Pregnant mothers should not be worried about their babies developing bipolar disorder just because they were infected with the flu, said Michael Silverman, MD, assistant professor of psychiatry at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City. “The four-fold increase seems to be a big deal, especially when you see that bipolar disorder only affects 1 percent of the population, but women should not be concerned,” Dr. Silverman said. There’s nothing new here, and nothing a mother should pay attention to.”Researchers also did not take into consideration other potential causes of bipolar disorder, such as genetic factors, he added.And the findings don’t show that the flu causes bipolar disorder, he said, but only an association that may do nothing but scare pregnant women.“Women are going to be worried that if they get the flu, their child is going to be damaged,” he said. “But the risk is very small. It’s really nothing.”A simple flu shot will help ward off the flu, which in turn may help reduce risk of bipolar disease offspring, Silverman said. The flu shot will not harm the fetus, so for women who are already pregnant it’s never too late to get vaccinated.“If this study tells us anything,” he said, “it's that women should get vaccinated for the flu, especially if they are pregnant.”""Bipolar Disorder Risk for Babies Born to Moms Who Had Flu"" originally appeared on Everyday Health."

However, I have no problem downing an occasional bag of stale Doritos. The point is, life is short. That is what kept running through my head each time I prepared to meet a new Match.com date. ""Life is short,"" I would tell myself. What if I get there and he is fat, bald, stupid, too short, too tall, has wiry eyebrows or a high pitched voice, wears ironed jeans, laughs loud, chews with his mouth open, wears queer shoes, stares at my boobs, smells like Marlboros and Pabst, wears a thick gold chain or any combination of the above. Then I answered my own question with, ""So what?""Since my divorce several years ago, I am noticing more midlife couples around me jumping onto the ""ending our marriage"" bandwagon. We hit that kids are gone, midlife mark, and sit back and take a good, long look at each other. You look into that person's eyes and think, ""If I hear you clear your throat one more time, I will jab a knife through your eye or throw myself from a bridge."" We tell ourselves ""life is short, I should be happier."" Suddenly we find ourselves in divorce court, and before the dust has even settled, we are wandering around in our new rented condo, telling ourselves, ""Now this is more like it,"" as we heat up a Lean Cuisine and watch Chopped marathons. Ahhhh, the good life.Needless to say, it doesn't take long before we decide we miss the companionship of the opposite sex, and decide to get back out there. Here is where the life is short thing comes in and, I believe the problem starts. Don't go on these dates with the mindset that you are finding your next husband or wife. Go with the idea that it is a new adventure, with a new person, and if he has brown teeth it's OK because it is an hour out of your time, and maybe you will try that new drink you've been hearing about with the raspberry vodka. I began dating with the attitude, ""I hope he is promising, I don't want to waste my time."" I found I would go on these dates, sit across from the gentleman, look at his face and in my mind immediately think, ""Ugh, I could never marry you."" I knew I couldn't just say, ""I am so sorry, I can see you wear short sleeve dress shirts, so I just don't think this is going to work out."" After a while, I realized it wouldn't kill me to get to know the person if only for the hour, learn about his life experience and find out why he is sitting across the table from a woman who obviously does not like bowling, and who is probably thinking, ""Ugh, I could never marry you.""Guess what happened. I had fun! I made friends. I learned a lot from the male's perspective. One guy told me, ""I went out on a date and there was only one problem. She was actually smarter than me."" Warning to men: you may find this happens from time to time. Dude. Seriously?Sure I had some wild times, but you will have to wait for my book for the specifics. My kids read this, but I have never seen any of them actually read a book so it should be fine. Yes, I even had my heart broken a time or two, and probably caused a little heart break as well. It's all part of learning who you are now, and what you want in a partner, for this next phase in life.I ask just one thing of you: don't settle. This is our chance to get it right. Go out, have fun, meet all types of people, be safe while doing it, but always have an open mind. More importantly get to know yourself! You have changed and most likely so have the traits you want in a partner. Take the time to learn who you are now. Girls, don't panic and grab the first penis that comes along. Trust me, they all have them. It's what's attached to them that matters. Men, yes I know... boobs. We all have them, look above them to find what it is that will truly make you happy.Yes, life is short, so take the time to savor that Cabernet, lick the Dorito salt off your fingers, and get to know your date as an interesting person and possible friend, if not something more down the road. One more thing, just in case: Raspberry vodka, soda and twist of lime... to die for."

But, at the end of the day, when I go home each night, he is no longer there. In order to ensure that my apartment reflects the new person I feel I have become, I have had to make a few changes.It was necessary for me to do some spring cleaning (this past winter) post-divorce. These are the items I think are important to make changes to so that you can go on with your life. Let me know if you have anything to add to the list.1. The Bed: This was a must for me. We had a king-sized bed that was the first thing we really purchased together. As much as I loved it, it had to go. I replaced it with a much less expensive Queen-sized bed that is a totally different color. Best of all, it's all mine.2. Jewelry: Having an Eat, Pray, Love moment, I purchased an amazing silver ring in an Italian street market during a post-divorce trip to Italy. Each time I look down at my ring, I don't think about the fact that my marriage ended, but rather that I am whole again.3. Pictures: When we first moved to New York, we found some fun pictures for our apartment. I loved them, but they represented a different time in my life. Out they went. Donate it; give it away or just put it in a closet until you are ready to part with it. I have pictures that represent who I am today, not who I was yesterday.4. Bathroom: This may seem a little silly, but it was so important to me. I am not saying to get rid of your entire bathroom, but since it is a place where I put myself together each day, I had to make it my own again. I replaced my towels and my shower curtain and a few of the knick-knacks on the counter. Bed, Bath and Beyond became a good friend post-divorce. A new start is important visually as well as mentally.5. Energy Drainers: I love people. I am a very social person. But it became clear to me early on that I needed to be around people who supported me and didn't just remind me of my failed marriage. It took some time for me to see our ""couples"" friends again, but now I can do it effortlessly."

Some people have anxiety or depression. Others have a limp. Maybe you think your nose is too big. Bald, hairy, short, fat or thin, whatever it is, the common denominator in all of these perceived misfortunes is that everyone believes theirs is the biggest problem of all. It's what defines them. When they meet new people, they think that's all that anyone notices about them. Beeeeeep!""Damn it!"" Click. ""Damn machine hung on me again!"" And so it went. Beep after beep. Call after call. Frustration after frustration. I got all the way down to onions this time. Just a couple more left.It was my first job as a sous chef -- a big deal for a young cook -- and sous chefs do the ordering. I was attempting to call in the opening order for vegetables. To my chagrin, we needed just about everything. I wasn't worried about coming up with specials, making schedules, doing food costing or even cooking. Especially cooking! That I could do. My arch-nemesis was calling in these damn orders. ""Maybe one more call would do it,"" I thought to myself as sweat poured down my face and I started to dial againIt's funny how your whole life flashes before your eyes at the sound of something as trivial as the beep of an answering machine. For me, that sound triggered thoughts of failure and dismay. ""Hi, it's m-m-me again. We need one case of R-r-r-r-r-roma tomatoes, two bunches of b-b-b-basil...""Beeeeeep! ""Is this ever going to get easier? What does the guy on the other end of this phone think of me? Will anyone really take me seriously?""Most people take things like, well, talking for granted. It's such a simple thing. First, you gather your thoughts, you then decide what to say and finally you just say it. Your vocal chords start to vibrate like strings on a guitar or wings of a hummingbird, and then your lips and tongue form the shapes that make the sounds of the letters. Easy, right? Not so much for the more than three million Americans who stutter. This week -- May 13 to 19 -- is National Stuttering Awareness Week, and I'd like to share with you one chef's personal story: mine. I stutter. Always have, and always will. For the better part of my younger life it felt all-consuming. Elementary school was tough. High school was tougher -- lots of trips down to Vice Principal Parks' office. He would say, ""It takes two to tango."" I never quite got that one! College got easier, but the thought of going out into the real world was terrifying. I believed my stuttering defined me in a way that made me feel lesser than everybody else. And that terrifying thought clung to me like a shadow every day of my life for years.I moved out to L.A. after college in 1990 to go to music school, but I made my living as a cook. In 1991, just shy of turning 24, I went to Wolfgang Puck's newest venture in Malibu called Granita. It was the crème de la crème of restaurants, and he was the crème de la crème of chefs. I really wanted to work there more than anything else in my life. I went back day after day, week after week until finally the executive chef, Joseph Manzare, really noticed me. ""You got guts,"" he said with a thick, gruff New York accent. ""I like that. Some jerk no-showed today, you wanna hang out and give us a hand?""""Absolutely,"" I replied. It didn't frighten me at all. I wasn't sweating, scared or remotely pensive. I knew my cooking skills were at least good enough to land me work at a station in the kitchen.They put me on the pasta station with Chrissy. I thought to myself, ""Pasta, now this is my lucky day!"" I worked alongside Chrissy, and at the end of the night, I saw her and Joseph have a little powwow in the corner. They both emerged and Joseph asked, ""Why don't you come back tomorrow?""""Yes, Chef. Sure thing,"" I responded calmly, though inside I was giddy.I came back day after day to work the pasta station. I felt like I was the luckiest guy in the whole world working at the greatest place on Earth. Granita was the hottest restaurant in Los Angeles at the time. I really couldn't believe it. I was getting my shot. One day, Chef Puck walked in, and jumped on the line with us. Back then he only had a few restaurants, so he would make the rounds and hop in wherever he was needed. He reached across the counter to shake my hand. He looked at me and asked, ""What's your name?""That's the big one: ""What's your name?"" I know it seems like such an inconceivable question to be nervous about answering. You know your name. You've had it for your entire life. Yet, it's a dreaded question for most people who stutter.""Um...well...uuhhh....M-M-M....ahem...(cough)...(cough)...M-M-M-Marc,"" I replied after what seemed to be a lifetime. ""Nice to meet you,"" he said with a smile.""Nice to meet you too!"" I smiled back.""Do you know how to cook?"" he asked almost jokingly. ""I think I'm pretty good,"" I said with confidence... and no stutter.I don't know what it was, but his response to hearing me say my name just made me feel at ease. Maybe it was the fact that he just looked at me and talked to me like a normal person, or maybe because he just kept the conversation going like nothing happened. Whatever it was, it was one of those moments. One of those magical moments that makes you believe in yourself. I assume everyone has these moments. They are little moments throughout your life that change you. They are the moments that define you. If you connect them, they seem like your DNA, or the woven fabric of your life. I have had many of them, however, none seemingly as important as this one. It was that very day that I thought to myself: ""Maybe I can do this thing."" Confidence is the one thing that many people who stutter lack. We're always worried about what other people think. That day, I realized that maybe people aren't as caught up in it as I thought they were. Joseph didn't seem to care, and Wolf certainly didn't either.I cooked that night next to Wolf. We joked and rocked out about 400 covers on the pasta station together. After staging for a few weeks, I eventually got a real paying job at Granita, and worked there for a couple years before moving onto some other restaurants in L.A., and then eventually leaving for Italy. The rest, as they say, is history.Like I said, everybody has got ""something."" My ""something"" happens to be stuttering, which, for so long, I thought was a big negative in my life. These days, I view my stutter a lot differently than I used to. I cook, call in orders, expedite tickets and don't think about it much. Hell, I even give lectures, do cooking demonstrations in front of audiences and talk to Anthony Bourdain on national TV. Instead of obsessing over the idea of what people are thinking of me, I believe most people are more interested in what I'm saying, rather than how I'm saying it. And if they're not, I guess that's just their problem.That ""something"" that I used to think defined me in a negative way, doesn't actually define me at all. It's just one of the many important pieces that help make me the person I am. I wouldn't change a thing. (Well, maybe I'd have a little more hair on my head, but that's about it.) Truth be told, I can't -- and won't -- imagine myself as not being a stutterer. In fact, it's a title I'll wear proudly alongside chef, husband, dad, son, brother, friend and Philadelphian."

Today, I want to celebrate my mother because she taught me something so essential and enduring that it has become my greatest passion: cooking. And through cooking, touching, feeling, preparing, and savoring good, real food made from real ingredients, I get to inhabit fully my home and my kitchen; to heal my body; and to connect with friends, family, the Earth, and the larger community in which I live. Cooking, I have come to see, is a truly transformational act. The closer we can get to the food we eat, the shorter the link between field and fork, the better off we will all be. We have outsourced our cooking to the industrial food system. By taking back our kitchens -- which we can do simply, easily, and inexpensively -- we can create a tidal shift in our food system. Mothers are exactly the allies we need to lead this food and cooking revolution. Sadly, most mothers today were not taught by their mothers to cook. The food industry deliberately celebrated ""convenience"" 50 years ago and in so doing, disenfranchised an entire generation of Americans from their kitchens and the essential act of cooking, the glue that delicately holds together our society, our health, and our connection to the Earth and to each other.So, for Mother's Day, I asked my mother to share her connection to food, handed down through her mother, which she then gifted to me, helping me learn the beautiful connections between gardening, cooking, eating, and wellness. And I have taught that to my children who have become wildly gifted cooks, making delicious home-cooked meals from real ingredients.Here is what my mother shared with me:My mother, Mary, was born in 1908 and was raised primarily in the country, when she was not boarding at the Lexington School for the Deaf. Her language, as was my father's, was sign language. Today, it is called ASL, or American Sign Language.On this Mother's Day, I wish all families a happy cooking day, a happy cooking life. But today, do make sure someone else cooks for Mom.Please leave your thoughts by adding a comment below -- but remember, we can't offer personal medical advice online, so be sure to limit your comments to those about taking back our health!To your good health,Mark Hyman, MDMark Hyman, M.D. is a practicing physician, founder of The UltraWellness Center, a five-time New York Times bestselling author, and an international leader in the field of Functional Medicine.

I wanted to be Matriarch for a day, surrounded by my well-dressed family at an ostentatious, over-priced Sunday brunch. But what I really wanted most of all was what most mothers want on Mother's Day: recognition for a job well done.Single mothers don't get much of that. Putting aside how vilified single mothers can be in the culture, when your kids are young, they tend to be short on perspective. You're only as good as your last mac n' cheese dinner. If it weren't for the prompting of teachers crafting Mother's Day cards, the day would go by unnoticed for many of us.My son would make me a card at school each year and I treasured and kept every single one. Every gift -- the button and pipecleaner bracelet, the photograph of a horse (I like horses, he always remembers), the mosaic trivet he made in art class. He's a super kid. But for most of his life there was no man around honoring his mom on Mother's Day. I divorced his dad when he was four (and we never celebrated the holiday much when we were together; my ex neither honored his mother or myself).But kind of like Valentine's Day can remind single people how single they are, Mother's Day has a way of making single moms feel quite alone. It's often seen as a celebration of the traditional nuclear family. Of the legacy that comes from being partnered, of having a spouse say, ""Wow, I'm so happy we made these kids together.""When I was a child, Mother's Day was always spent with four generations of women -- my great-grandmother, grandmother, mother, and aunt, at an after-church luncheon at the Village Women's Club outside Detroit. The men would be in suits, my grandfather would hold court (he loved nothing more than to be surrounded by his family suffering the discomforts of formal dress attire). From my child's perspective it was interminable. Adults having cocktails. Children staving off their hunger with dry breadsticks. Fidgeting. Reprimands. At last dining. And then, if you were lucky, breaking free to run across the daffodil gardens outside, where it was still early spring.It was conveyed to me was that this was a day of importance. It was an occasion to honor your mother, that had the gravitas of formality, of obligation and ritual.Fast forward 25 years to being a single mother in my mid-30s. I would've settled for a flipped pancake and a hug.Single mothers work so damn hard, they deserve all the honor we can give them. I know single dads work hard too, (my brother was a single dad with two autistic kids for years -- he's heroic) -- but today I'm talking to the single moms out there -- you rock. I admire you immensely.I blog about infidelity, and every day, women write to me who were cheated on while pregnant, whose husbands walked out on them with infants, small children, walked out on their teenage kids and never called again, stay-at-home moms who find themselves trying to find work again with less than baseline child support and big gap in their resumes -- heart breaking stories. And yet, they get up every day and do the hard work of raising kids on their own. Either entirely by themselves, or carrying the majority of the parenting weight. (And before the father's rights people comment -- they don't do this by choice -- but because men still exist who abandon their families.)Single moms are mighty -- and they deserve more than a bouquet of flowers and a nice breakfast -- they deserve our respect. If you know a single mom, take a moment to tell her how much you admire the hard work she's doing. Babysit her kids for an hour or two. Cook a dinner. Fete her with brunch. Sit with her children help them make her card. Do not let this day go unnoticed. This is a day of importance. It is an occasion. It's over a decade since I was that single mom with a preschooler. I've been remarried for going on three years. I don't have children with my husband -- we have a blended family of three young men. The first Mother's Day we were together, my husband got me flowers. He wrapped lovely, thoughtful presents. He brought me coffee in bed. Later that day, he put on a pressed shirt (he hates all things dry-clean), he made my son put on a pressed shirt, and my step-son put on a pressed shirt -- and then three handsome men took me out to brunch."

And for those of us who have lost a loved one, certain holidays can become excruciating reminders of the persons we so dearly miss. After all, how are we to celebrate Christmas without a family or New Year's without friends? Similarly, how can we possibly enjoy Mother's Day without mom?Mother's Day can turn grim and nostalgic without that loving lady in your life. But physical presence isn't necessary to prove that mom is still with you. You can feel her spiritual companionship -- a much more powerful presence -- by performing a few special deeds this Mother's Day or, better yet, every day:Forgive her: As in any normal family, you and your mother may have argued, held grudges, and bickered for little or no reason. Mothers are human and they make mistakes, too! But if she's no longer with you, chances are you feel deep regret for ever having raised your voice at your mom. Now is the time to make peace with her and with yourself. From the moment in which you forgive someone, you begin to detach from negative memories and can bring your emotions back to balance. Forgiving your mom for her faults helps you remember only her best qualities. Buy her a present: Buy your mom a gift you know she'd love. My own late mother always wanted a certain watch, which she never got the chance to buy. After her passing, I bought her that watch and placed it on her bed as a validation that I wanted to make her wish a reality. Though you can't physically give it to her, you can symbolically gift mom with a special something as a sign of your recognition.Speak to her: Speak to your mom as if she were next to you. Speaking without constraint allows you to release your emotions, relinquish tensions and fears, and helps establish a form of communication. Wish your mom a good morning or a good night, remind her that you're making her favorite meal tonight or that her grandchildren are doing great in school. Speak freely, she's listening. Write her a letter: Write your mom a heartfelt letter allowing your emotions to transcribe through your words. Tell her everything and anything you want. Jot down your feelings, even if what you're feeling is guilt, anger, or bitterness. Ask your mom for divine help; request her guidance on pressing matters in your life. You may leave this letter at her resting place, on her bed, or wherever you feel her most present.Take her advice: Remember how your mom had that uncanny, almost irksome ability to predict what would happen? Well, as much as you may not want to, it's time to start thinking like your mom. Before making an important move or decision, ask yourself, ""What would mom have to say about this?"" It's never too late to acknowledge that a mother really does know best.Watch for signs: Even if you're a firm disbeliever in communication with the other side, suspend your disbelief for just once. I believe that the other side often tries to communicate with us through small hints that remind us that a world beyond our own does exist. Signs from the other side can include inexplicable noises in the house, flickering lights in a room, or randomly spotting your mom's name on a sign. Be attentive for messages that you feel are not mere coincidences. Believe in her love: Believe that love is eternal. Believing that this emotion can transcend any physical death will help you fill the void left by a missing mother. Your mother is the source of love from which you come; this means that as long as you are alive, that unparalleled love is alive within you. Shift your mentality: The way in which we deal with difficult situations is greatly impacted by our mentality; if you choose to see physical loss as a tragedy, then it truly is. But, if you understand that perhaps from the other side mom can help you in ways she could not in the physical world, then you begin to see her passing as a great resource of divine aid. Losing a mother is nothing short of a devastating experience. But if you believe that the human spirit lives on, you can continue to feel unique love and unconditional protection from your mother forever.

9,BLACK VOICES,"Charles Ramsey, 'Ratchet' Social Media and the Exploitation of Lower-Class Blacks","Ernest Owens, Contributor
America's Youngest Weekly Columnist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/charles-ramsey-ratchet-so_us_5bade15ce4b0bb1705fb416f,"The experiences of Charles Ramsey, Sweet Brown and Antoine Dodson are unique in a sense that the public is making fun of their sincere demeanor.",2013-05-12,"Washington,DC- MAY 11 Radio Talk Show Host Rock Newman interviews Charles Ramsey about his heroic effort to free three women held against their will by Ariel Castro. (Photo by Lucian Perkins/For The Washington Post via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bade15c200000e800ff2425.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I think the word ""ratchet"" might be on my top five lists of most hated words (the N-word and ""YOLO"" are among my highest). I was at a bar one night in Philadelphia when I constantly heard a girl across from me mimicking a colloquial country accent. Every time she found it relevant to use, she kept saying ""ain't nobody got time for that,"" and each time her group of friends laughed in volumes. It happened again later that week at Penn. This time with a group of my fellow black peers. They too laughed when someone put on the same dialogue. When our teacher's assistant asked what was going on, one of them said boldly: ""we're being ratchet.""Neither the girl from the bar or the black peers from my college are illiterate. Neither of them appeared to have come from a background that would suggest that they are not capable of speaking correct grammar. They were acting as if they were the now exploited web star  Sweet Brown, who became a viral social media sensation after surviving a fire in her lower-income apartment complex in Oklahoma City. This is nothing new. Over the past few days, I continue to see my Facebook and Twitter pages gust with many of my Caucasian peers sharing YouTube links of Charles Ramsey. The black Cleveland dishwasher, who helped rescue Amanda Berry, has made headlines for his outspoken and frank account of that fateful day. His infamous quote, ""Bro, I knew that something was wrong when a pretty little white girl ran into a black man's arms. Something is wrong here. Dead giveaway,"" is mocked and laughed at by some of my snobbier black peers.And while I see the viral boom of Sweet Brown and Charles Ramsey take place in recent memory, I am also reminded of Antoine Dodson. Yes, the man known for his ""Hide your kids, hide your wife,"" rant initiated his unexpected claim to fame by reporting the attempted house intrusion and rape of his sister in his Lincoln Park housing project in Huntsville, Alabama. And while the incident eventually led to a high selling iTunes single, the rest of the public laughed at this man rather than emphasize with the unfortunate circumstances.There tends to be a disgusting trend starting in our society, across all races, of teasing and exploiting the disadvantages and misfortunes of the black lower class. Even beyond blacks, one can see such nastiness take place with the increasing celebrity of Honey Boo-Boo. However, one may also suggest that the attention is warranted given that they signed on to a reality show on TLC.The experiences of Charles Ramsey, Sweet Brown and Antoine Dodson are unique in a sense that the public is making fun of their sincere demeanor. None of them ever imagined that they would be in the spotlight for their responses on local television news stations. None of them ever thought that they would profit from what many would deem as societal flaws and mishaps. And none of them also expected that they would be under the same scrutiny of a public figure who actually asks for it.These ""social media sensations"" represent many of the black lower class. They are oftentimes the non-college educated, minimum wage, government-assisted people who live just to survive another day on their limited resources. And while many of us think that it is hilarious to hear them speak broken English, or share candidly their experiences in poverty, this is a harsh reality for them. And why do we find this funny?The unfortunate conclusion that can be drawn from all of this is that many of the spectators in the higher bracket of society are looking for a remedy for their own personal insecurities with privilege. The grand old fashion ""kick a person when they are already down"" mentality is revived when we see Ivy League students mock the consequences of economic hardships: poverty and illiteracy. It's an even larger telling of our society's ill intentions when we find it more interesting to commentate on the mannerisms of a victim rather than be disappointed in the crime itself. An attempted rape/burglary, an apartment complex fire, and a kidnap rescue are not a laughing matter. A showing of black poverty is nothing to joke about. Hardships and broken English due to the disparities of social inequality are not as well. Do we even know what we are laughing at?Oh, it's ratchet right? Anytime we see a black person in the street poorly clothed and communicating in a dialect we know all too well to avoid is ratchet. What does that even say about us to create such a word to classify them? When I heard Charles Ramsey speak on CNN, I did not see a new man... I saw the face of thousands. Growing up in Chicago and moving to Houston, I have seen men like him work at my school as janitors. I have seen men like him have a rap sheet but strive to overcome it. Men like Charles Ramsey exist and while much of the media rather exploit his shortcomings and laugh at his imperfections, this does nothing to solve the problem at hand.So, coming from a background that has seen economic inequality and disadvantage, I will explain people like Ramsey, Brown, and Dodson. First, they do not choose to talk in ""that accent."" It is a result of a failed education system somewhere in a below poverty environment or lower class community. Second, that ""ratchet"" you speak of is a product of their experience. As a result of poverty-stricken areas, crime is a negative response to the lack of jobs and resources flowing in the community. Consequently, such misfortunes as you saw with Brown and Dodson do happen frequently. And third, making them ""heroes"" because of the manner that they speak on their misfortune is as backhanded and slighted as the crime itself. Yes, it takes a lot of humility to share such horrific tales. But perhaps much of their intent was initially intended to bring awareness to the issue than just mere humor. Did anyone ever go back to those communities and see what can be done to stop these issues? Even though Dodson, Brown and possibly Ramsey will make it out, what about the rest?As social media unites various levels of class, the racial exploitation that occurs needs to be re-evaluated. What makes everyone across different privileged settings find it funny to mock the dialogue of a poor, middle-aged black woman surviving a fire? Why does it make any sense to trivialize and now demoralize a man who saved a young woman who has been missing for many years? If you have the answer, then stop it. If you are still pondering, perhaps you should visit the various neighborhoods these people come from instead."

11,BUSINESS,Good Governance Requires Dimon to End Dual Roles at J. P. Morgan Chase,"Frank Vogl, Contributor

World leaders, Influential executives, bankers and policy makers attend the 43rd annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, the five day event runs from Jan. 23-27.

Morgan Chase should be divided have centered on the skills and personality of Jamie Dimon who currently holds both positions. Shareholders of J.P. Morgan Chase will vote on this issue at their annual meeting on May 21, 2013. They should not focus on the particular skills of Dimon, but rather on core issues of good governance. If the issue was just about the management skills of Dimon, then his record should suffice to allow him to keen the two top posts. But, the much more substantive context that should be considered needs to embrace the health of our global financial system and whether banks like Chase today can be well-managed at all. Successful global banks have grown and become enormously more complex in recent years. These leviathans operate in dozens of countries and dozens of markets. Their employees come from a multitude of nations. Whether they are known as Citi, HSBC, J.P. Morgan Chase, Barclays, UBS, Deutsche, all seem to be accident prone. Despite myriad official regulations and an enormous burden on the banks to find ways to comply with the ever-rising volume of new reporting requirements, the fact is to quote former U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld in another context, ""stuff happens.""  That ""stuff"" may range from a formidable trading loss, attributed to the ""London Whale"" at J. P. Morgan Chase; to full-scale LIBOR interest rate manipulation by Barclays and UBS and many others; to global international money laundering by HSBC. While the banks deploy ever more risk managers and construct ever more sophisticated risk management models, the costly errors and the cases of malfeasance abound.Concerned with the systemic risks that a particularly expensive accident might have at a giant bank, the authorities have been increasing capital requirements and contemplating leverage ratio reductions. Such measures may to a degree reduce the danger of a full-scale 2008-type financial crisis, but it also adds to the management burdens at the banks themselves.This is the context that ought to be fully considered as shareholders in giant financial services firms determine whether the positions of CEO and Chairman should be divided. Breaking up the biggest banks because they are perceived as ""too big to fail"" is unrealistic. What is needed, however, are improvements in the transparency and the accountability of governance in these institutions.The major banks should all have ""living wills"" that detail how they would be carefully wound-down and, if necessary liquidated, or merged in part into other institutions, in the event that they failed. The ""living wills"" should be determined by the board of directors and its key outlines should be made known to shareholders. This is a governance issue - not one that should directly involve the CEO, the top institutional manager, unless of course the institution finds itself failing.Similarly, it is the board's prime responsibility to oversee the actions of management and to ensure that a corporate culture of high integrity prevails. While the CEO and his management team may often feel the drive to build profits somewhat overshadows other priorities, it is for the board to provide a check on this and ensure there is balance to both secure an ethical culture, and to demonstrate to regulators and investors alike that a such a culture prevails.In exceptionally complex institutions that have long records of experiencing that ""stuff happens"", the argument for a strong board of directors that is seen to be accountable to shareholders and whose actions are both transparent and effective, is vital. This level of authority and yes, independence relative to management, is not possible in such complex giant institutions without a clear divide between the CEO and the board's chairman. Each has a distinct role and accountability to employees, shareholders and regulators. Dividing the roles is, of course, not enough. Boards of directors of the world's biggest banks need to be composed of individuals who have substantial experience of managing large and complex institutions, they should devote considerable amounts of time to their board responsibilities, and they should be highly active in their work. Unfortunately, this is not the case today in the boards of many of the biggest banks, where the CEO, even if he does not hold the Chairman title, dominates the institution, the agenda of the board and often influences the selection of new board members, so undermining the crucial goal of a strong and independent board.Frank Vogl, has spent more than two decades involved in global banking policy issues."
