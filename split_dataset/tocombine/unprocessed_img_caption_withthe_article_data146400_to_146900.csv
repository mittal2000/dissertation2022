My husband stayed home all day, ate dinner with us and then left to go to work. My daughter got to hang out with both her parents all day and I got tons of alone time at night. Then last month, our income and my ""me time"" disappeared when my husband lost his job.I spent the first couple of weeks dwelling on the negatives aspects of having a unemployed husband. It was easy, but unproductive. The second I started focusing on the positives, my mood turned around.While I would never wish a job loss on anyone, if it happens to you, here are some arguments as to why this may not be the worst thing to happen to your family.Night, Night: When my husband had a job, he rarely got to tuck our daughter into bed at night. Now, every night, she gets a book read to her by daddy.Live-In Babysitter: Remember when you dreamed of having a babysitter so you could get some time to yourself or leave your apartment when your kid was sleeping? Those days are over! Now, you can leave your kid at home with your partner and go out for a long overdue night on the town with your friends. Walks: Walks are free and fun, so take lots of them. You can give your kid a tour of the neighborhood you lived in before they were born or explore a new one.Playgrounds: While you're going on lots of walks, don't forget to visit the playgrounds. This is another fun and free activity. We found a new playground five minutes away from our home filled with hippopotamuses! It's amazing how many cool things you miss when you are too busy.Each Other: Make up for all the date nights you missed when your spouse was busy at work. It's good for your marriage to reconnect and once the dust is settled, you can start to come up with a plan to find a new job or maybe even start a business together?"

""You can do the whole",2013-08-12,Outdoors in the city in spring. An urban lifestyle. A man looking up at a high wall covered in climbing plants and foliage.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d6b133c000032000a24bf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"We all strive for this thing called happiness. But according to Sean Meshorer, author of ""The Bliss Experiment,"" we should instead work to unearth bliss.""Bliss is an inward, authentic form of happiness that isn't contingent on any outward circumstance,"" the author and spiritual teacher told The Huffington Post in an interview. And compared to regular, everyday ""happiness,"" the contrast becomes clear. ""There's almost always an external component to happiness... Even when you think about the kinds of things that are more important -- like a warm, loving relationship -- happiness requires that other person outside of ourselves with whom we're having that relationship."" Bliss, instead, relies on just one individual: You. Bliss isn't a matter of perceiving your life as utopia. ""We can't be Pollyannaish,"" Meshorer says. ""In our lives, things always go wrong. None of us have perfect lives."" The wonder of bliss, however, is that it prevents the inevitable things that do go wrong from devastating us. When we tap into bliss, ""things really can shift."" To activate the transformational principles of bliss, you have to make tapping into your bliss a daily practice. But this isn't as daunting as it seems. ""None of this is very hard to do, you just have to do a little bit every day and you can make tremendous progress very quickly,"" the teacher encourages.You have control of your thoughts, and there are a few tried and true techniques to guide these thoughts toward bliss.Learn to have reflexive compassion instead of reflexive hatred or criticism.  You're driving along the highway, bopping your head to your favorite song, feeling entirely zen, when, suddenly, a maniacal driver speeds past you and -- just barely missing your headlight -- cuts you off. Stop. What's your first instinct? In this instance, most of us immediately put blame on the disruptive driver: He's inconsiderate, reckless and -- you know, a  multitude of expletives. This reaction is a product of reflexive hatred. When you practice reflexive compassion instead, you give the driver the benefit of the doubt -- he's racing his wife, who's in labor, to the hospital; he's 10-minutes away from missing his flight. You'll actually be doing yourself a favor when you choose compassion. Instead of working yourself up, you'll be able to sooner return to enjoying your road trip. Meshorer says that putting yourself in someone else's shoes when in a tense situation is the key to feeling more blissful every single day.Practice gratitude. Make an actual gratitude list. This practice does not discount the hard fact that life can be rough -- ""you're not reframing the negative,"" Meshorer says, but just pulling out all the positive in your life to examine. This exercise isn't preachy, it's practical. ""Just take the time every day to remember the things in your life that are going right,"" says Meshorer, who believes if you have a warm cup of coffee in the morning, then you've got it good. The benefits of practicing gratitude reach far beyond feeling content with your life as is: Being thankful has been shown to strengthen relationships, promote better sleep and increase immune health, to boot. And if you're sitting at your desk feeling anything but bliss, this may just be the remedy for you. ""You can do the whole practice in 10 - 20 seconds in your head,"" Meshorer advises. Recall a couple of wonderful things about your life, or craft a physical list to revisit and add to when the inspiration hits.Try a Japa meditation. Japa, a spiritual discipline that involves the repetition of a mantra, could help you pull out of a stressful situation and discover a calmer disposition. Meshorer, who has used this practice to overcome panic attacks, recommends coming up with a sacred word formula that has meaning to you. This collection of words doesn't have to have a spiritual or religious connotations, just a centering quality to offer some peace of mind.You can take this practice anywhere: In line at the bank, a high-stress meeting at work, even in a crowded bar. All Japa requires is silently repeating your word formula in your mind. ""What that does is crowd out negative thoughts, because you're replacing them with something positive -- there's not enough space for reflexive negativity."" This is an especially useful practice for anyone who finds meditation intimidating or too time-consuming. ""It's very informal,"" Meshorer assures. ""The sacred word formula takes some of the aspects of what meditation does and makes it flexible for your life circumstances."" The practice, he says, quiets your mind and helps you focus on ""positive, beautiful things."" Spend some time thinking about your ""purpose."" The whole ""why am I here?"" question can be a bit, well, existential to tackle in one sitting. Fear not: There are ways to explore your purpose on a smaller scale. And you'll want to. ""If you can have that underlying sense of meaning and purpose in your life, it infuses everything you do and helps give you the resources to move forward."" Meshorer suggests asking yourself questions like, ""What kinds of things make me smile?,"" ""What kinds of things make me lose track of time?,"" and ""What makes me feel good about myself?"" These are starting points to help you better understand -- and appreciate -- your being. Even more, understanding your purpose provides clarity. ""It gives you confidence. With that confidence comes an inner peace, a sense of connectedness."" And. perhaps most importantly, finding meaning in your existence will build you a more resilient shell. Just that fact can be very comforting. ""We all have good days and we have bad days. Bad things happen to us. Good things happen to us. When things are a little bit chaotic, if we have that kind of anchor inside ourselves, we still know what overall direction we’re headed in, we have a way to course-correct."" "

As an adult, I appreciate having a place where my husband, our friends, and I can get away from all children, including our own.",2013-08-12,Pretty young mom and toddler having fun playing on the dining table in a restaurant joyfully.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d6cbe2200008300d9a06f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A restaurant that my husband and I frequent has changed its main policy. There is a neatly typed sign on their door that states this change. No, they haven't gone formal attire only or raised their prices. You can still BYOB and they're still open until 1:00 a.m. So what's different? It is their child-friendly policy that has changed. The sign reads: ""No children under the age of 12 are permitted after 6:00 p.m."" The restaurant isn't the only place where I've noticed this new type of policy. There is also a local movie theatre that prohibits children during the ""adult hours"" which they classify as starting at 7:00 p.m. There seems to be a growing trend or backlash from formerly child-friendly places. They are either limiting the hours when they will allow children or not permitting children at all. And that's a good policy.The owner of my favorite restaurant, when asked, told me that he found he was losing customers because of the presence of children during the later dinner hours. When I said that my husband and I had never seen children misbehaving or causing a problem, he told me that behavior wasn't necessarily the problem. ""Adults need their own time alone without children present,"" he said. I have to agree. I love children and our own girls have been going to restaurants since they were babies. But, truthfully, we always limited the time we dined as a family to a child-friendly dinner hour of 5:00. It worked well for us and for them. They weren't overtired or hungry. It was for their own sake as well as for the sake of adult diners that made us choose what we felt was an appropriate time for them. Let me add that we did take them to the finer restaurants also, not just kid-friendly places, but we still chose an age-appropriate hour. In the news recently La Fisheria, a restaurant in Houston posted this message: ""After 7:00 p.m., people over 8-years-old only. We are a family friendly restaurant, but we also respect all of our customers... thanks for your understanding.""La Fisheria is just the latest eatery to establish a kids-free zone. This policy was initiated by the known frustration of adult customers. Many were upset at having their special, expensive dinners ruined by a children who misbehaved. A few years ago virtually every place you could name was child friendly. Certainly there were times when it was very inappropriate to bring a child to these places but it seemed as if children ""ruled."" Today the pendulum has swung in the opposite direction and more and more adults are voicing their opinions that some times and places should be reserved for grown-ups only. The way to change the minds of businesses to accommodate the adult population is the same method once used to insist on child friendly places -- money spent. Since a party of adults will spend considerably more than a family bringing small children, management will cater to adults. Restaurants and entertainment centers risk losing revenue if they don't bend to their clientele's wishes. There is nothing wrong with limiting the ""children's hour."" It has been done for years in live theatre. Theatre-goers are requested not to bring children under a certain age to a play or musical, (save for some Disney venues), and no one has a problem with that. As a parent, I understand the need to bring children with us to a place where they will be welcomed. As an adult, I appreciate having a place where my husband, our friends, and I can get away from all children, including our own. Everyone needs their own space and their own time. Maybe it's a good thing that not all places, at all times, are child accommodating. *** Read the just released Welcome to Hell by Kristen Houghton. An Amazon Kindle Best.""And Then I'll Be Happy!

3,WELLNESS,New Understanding Of Atherosclerosis Could Change The Way We Treat Heart Disease,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/atherosclerosis-heart-disease-plaques_us_5b9d6dade4b03a1dcc87e206,The new understanding of how macrophages reproduce within the plaque calls for the re-evaluation of current atherosclerosis,2013-08-12,3-dimensional CT scan of a posterior view of the heart of a 50 year old woman showing extensive calcification (shown in white) of the arch of the aorta and the descending aorta.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d6dad3c00005b000a25b3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Atherosclerosis -- the build-up of plaque in arteries, raising the risk for heart disease -- may not form the way we previously thought, according to a new study. The discovery could change the way we treat cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death in the U.S. and around the world, researchers noted. Research from the University of Toronto and Massachusetts General Hospital, found that macrophages -- white blood cells in tissue associated with inflammation -- replicate within the plaques to cause atherosclerosis. Scientists originally thought the inflammatory macrophages collected mainly with the support of monocytes -- white blood cells that respond to pathogens -- from the bloodstream. “Our study shows that the accumulation of macrophages also depends on their proliferation locally within the developing plaque,” study researcher Clint Robbins, assistant professor in the laboratory medicine and pathobiology departments at the University of Toronto, said in a statement. The new understanding of how macrophages reproduce within the plaque calls for the re-evaluation of current atherosclerosis therapy. Research has been concentrated on therapies that would block white cells from getting into the plaques, but not the growth of cells within the plaque. Statin therapy is now used to lower blood lipids that contribute to plaque. With more research, scientists may use statins -- which also have anti-inflammatory properties -- to limit the spread of macrophages within the plaques. Results of the study, published in the journal Nature Medicine, are based on mice subjects. More research is needed to know if findings are relevant to humans, though researchers did find evidence of macrophage growth in plaque on human carotid arteries. Scientists are interested in further finding if all macrophages or only subsets replicate within the plaque. "

These teens are also 2.5 times more likely to have sex by the time they reach the age of 15.""We find that first-born adolescents with half-siblings with the same mother but a different father do have less favorable outcomes compared to their peers with only full siblings, even after accounting for the mother's background characteristics, socioeconomic factors the child experienced growing up, and family instability and structure,"" Guzzo said.This isn't the first study to look at how familial instability influences a child's development. A University of Virginia study in July 2013 found that infants who spent at least one night a week apart from their mothers due to joint custody formed less secure attachments to them. And a recent study in the Journal of Consumer Affairs found that compulsive buying behavior in adulthood can be a result of parental divorce in childhood.Click through the slideshow below to see more significant divorce findings.Keep in touch!
