The newly ubiquitous flavoring is a popular option for the lineup of fall seasonal drinks at national coffeehouses like Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts and Tim Horton's. But whether it's a pumpkin latte or a spiced apple cider, these festive drinks can hide fat, sugar and calories amidst the evocative, limited-time flavors. We've listed a few of the most common offenders, all size medium unless otherwise noted, with more sugar than candy bars and enough fat to make a serious dent in your daily allowance. To combat calorie-laden drinks, the CDC recommends choosing the smallest size, replacing whole milk with skim where appropriate and forgoing the whipped cream. Unfortunately, they recommend skipping flavor syrups (how your pumpkin mocha latte is created) altogether. Not ready to let go of fall's fab flavors? At least know what you're getting yourself into:"

The pharmacy is currently being investigated for producing a contaminated steroid shot that included the meningitis fungus that has killed at least five people. (Photo by Jared Wickerham/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c6efd2000004e00fd914f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In one of this week's most anti-climatic news story, the Center for Disease Control and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) finally confirmed what everyone knew: The origin of the deadly meningitis outbreak was fungus found in steroid shots produced by the New England Compounding Center (NECC) in Framingham, Mass. With 20 already dead and hundreds sickened so far, no group seems more outraged than members of Congress who are demanding answers from the FDA about how it could have failed so badly to protect the public from this clearly-tainted operation. The FDA? The chronically-underfunded and understaffed agency (check out former FDA Commissioner David Kessler's testimony in 2008), the budget of which is currently threatened thanks to Congress' misplaced obsession with federal deficit cutting? (This reminds me of that VP debate exchange over Libyan embassy security, when Rep. Paul Ryan tried to lecture Vice President Biden over defense cuts while, as Biden pointed out, Ryan's own budget would cut embassy security by $300 million.)When it comes to ""compounding pharmacies,"" however, money's not the only issue. Following a six-year, million dollar lobbying campaign by the International Academy of Compounding Pharmacists, Congress in 2007 prohibited the agency from exercising proper authority over these companies. This effort included ""hundreds of its pharmacists canvass[ing] Capitol Hill urging lawmakers to abandon the proposed legislation [to increase FDA oversight]."" (What a sight that must have been! My mind goes right to that famous Monty Python skit with the pharmacist shouting behind the counter ""Who's got the pox? Who's got a boil on the bum?"") As to the legislation they killed, One version would have, among other things, strengthened the FDA's powers to inspect all retail pharmacies that make or dispense compounded medications. It would have required compounded drugs to get the same premarket approval from the FDA as generic drugs, and would require clinical trials in some instances. It also called for steps to restrict distribution of compounded medications beyond state lines. [...] Sarah Sellers, a former FDA official who worked on compliance issues involving compounding at the agency, says that ""political pressure from the compounders"" ultimately defeated the legislation.So while scapegoating the FDA might sound good, the law makes clear that this industry is basically on its own. And in that case, the only thing really holding it accountable is civil litigation. Lawsuits will hold drug companies directly accountable for the harm they cause when the government cannot. And that's essentially what the U.S. Supreme Court acknowledged in one of its rare recent decisions that recognized the value of civil litigation to strengthen corporate accountability even when the government also regulates. The case was Wyeth v. Levine (2009), and at issue was the Bush Administration policy of trying to prevent injured victims from holding drug companies accountable in court. The Supreme Court recognized that ""the FDA has limited resources to monitor the 11,000 drugs on the market"" and therefore, lawsuits ""offer an additional, and important, layer of consumer protection that complements FDA regulation."" No matter how much blame is heaped on the FDA, the Court confirmed the ""central premise of federal drug regulation that the manufacturer bears responsibility."" One of the little-noticed achievements of President Obama, which he accomplished almost as soon as he got into office, was to end that terrible Bush Administration policy. But unfortunately a president can't do everything, for example, when it comes to state laws enacted more than a decade ago. In 1995, Michigan passed a law immunizing drug companies that produce unsafe, government-approved drugs, essentially providing this industry a ""get out of jail free"" card even where the company is deliberately irresponsible, as long as the drug meets minimal government standards. Only Michigan residents are blocked from court under this law, but other states are trying to follow Michigan's lead. In part, this is due to the efforts of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the secretive group of corporations and conservative lawmakers that draft model bills and push them around to state legislatures. ALEC's model bill provides states with three ALEC-approved legislative choices for establishing drug industry immunity. Both Wisconsin and North Carolina lawmakers have recently considered legislation to do just that. The good news for all of these states is that ironically, drug industry immunity only kicks in if the drugs in question are FDA-approved. And thanks to the first-rate influence-peddling and lobbying prowess of compounding pharmacists, the tainted steroid shots at issue today are free and clear of FDA regulation. That has allowed Michigan to become home to one of the very first class action lawsuits filed by victims of the meningitis disaster. So what's next? There may be a new push in Congress to strengthen FDA oversight of compounding pharmacies. At the same time, the Republican House and Senate ""sequestration"" bills, H.R. 6389 and S. 3473, (their proposals to avoid mandatory spending cuts), both contain H.R. 5, the House-passed medical malpractice/drug industry/nursing home bill that would weaken the legal rights of sick patients as well as the accountability of negligent drug companies. As if there weren't enough reasons to worry about this election.For more by Joanne Doroshow, click here.For more health news, click here. "

I remember the frustration I felt at not having the mastectomy sooner. I wanted to fast track the whole thing. I wanted those things off yesterday.,2012-10-21,"'I Promised Myself When I Made It Through, I'd Take My Girls to Disney World'",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c617326000036007f74af.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Each of us has her own reason for making the decision to have a mastectomy. For some women, mastectomy is one of several possible treatment options. For others, mastectomy may be the only option. As for me, I was 39 years old with two kids and a significant family history of breast cancer. My mother, grandmother, and maternal aunt had all been diagnosed: my mother in her 50s, my grandmother in her 80s, and my aunt in her late 30s. And here I was, almost 40 years old, and I had only been for one mammogram so far. What I know now is that with my family history, I should have been getting a yearly mammogram and twice-yearly breast exams beginning at age 35. I had my first mammogram at age 32, when I thought I felt a lump. My wonderful OB/GYN at the time, who had seen my through the birth of my first child, felt it too, and another lump besides. She immediately sent me for a mammogram that, thankfully, came back normal.So, there I was seven years later. Life was busy, and I was in the trenches of parenting two wonderfully-spirited young girls. I was muddling along, in full denial of the fact that I have a real risk of breast cancer and should go for another mammogram. Actually, I wasn't in full denial. I had made several appointments -- and I had canceled several appointments. I did a monthly self-exam in the shower but sometimes I didn't really know what I was feeling. Looking back I may have felt a lump in my right breast but I was never exactly sure what I was feeling so I didn't pursue it -- a bump here, a rib there. What was cancer going to feel like anyway?In late February of 2008, I finally went for that mammogram. I was nervous as hell. They took the pictures and then told me to wait for the results. I waited a long time before they finally sent me home, but I was nervous because I had a feeling something was wrong. That night my primary care physician called me to say that they found something and they wanted me to come back for additional views. ""What we might be looking at here is invasive ductal cancer,"" she said. I'm pretty sure I almost died right then. I went back the next morning and the mammogram technician took additional images. The radiologist called me in and showed me the picture of my right breast blown up to the size of my head. There were some red pen marks circling the ""problem"" areas. I don't think I ate or slept much for the next few weeks. I did cry a lot though; I allowed myself only once to go ""there."" You know the place. The place where I am not here to take care of my two girls, who at the time were ages 3 and 8. My physician referred me to an affiliated hospital for a biopsy. The results came back as DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ) Stage 0 cancer. I was both shocked and elated -- shocked that age 39 I would be diagnosed with breast cancer of any kind, elated that after weeks of worrying, my cancer was found to be Stage 0, which meant that it hadn't spread beyond the milk ducts into the surrounding breast tissue. Maybe I had gotten lucky.I decided that I would undergo a bilateral mastectomy with immediate reconstruction. That's when they do the reconstruction within the same operation, right after the mastectomy part. I remember the frustration I felt at not having the mastectomy sooner. I wanted to fast track the whole thing. I wanted those things off yesterday. But I would have to settle for having the surgery a month or so after my diagnosis on April 16, 2008. I knew that the recovery process was not simple, but it wasn't awful either. I had watched my sister's recovery from a similar procedure a few months earlier and I am a rehabilitation professional myself, so I had those things going for me. But I still felt there was a lot of mastectomy recovery information I just didn't know. I turned to the Facing Our Risk of Cancer Empowered (FORCE) online message boards on a daily basis. FORCE is a non-profit organization devoted to providing support to women with increased familial risk for breast and ovarian cancer. The women posting on the FORCE board were an excellent source of information about hereditary breast cancer and various post-mastectomy recovery issues. And they were so supportive that I couldn't help but feel at home there.When I went back for my pathology results a week after the surgery, I was surprised to learn that my breast cancer had been invasive. Although the small biopsied area had only shown DCIS or Stage 0 cancer, there was also a small area of invasive cancer as well as other areas of DCIS and cancer extending into the lobules. So in the end, I would undergo adjuvant chemotherapy. And as far as I was concerned, the mastectomy had been the best choice for me and the pathology results confirmed it. I was happy with how I looked reconstruction-wise and I hadn't really had too much pain. Discomfort yes, but full-on pain, not so much of that really. And now I could rest easy that the cancer was gone and if I could just get over this next chemotherapy hurdle, life would go back to normal. And it did.Excerpt from Now What?

A common class of pesticide is causing problems for both honeybees and wild bumblebees, important species already in trouble, say two new scientific studies. The new research suggests the chemicals designed to attack the central nervous system of pests also reduce the weight and number of queens in bumblebee hives and that they cause more honeybees to become disoriented and fail to return to their hives. (AP Photo/David Goulson, Stirling University)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb124302500003200380f7f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Alister DoyleOSLO (Reuters) - Pesticides used in farming are also killing worker bumblebees and damaging their ability to gather food, meaning colonies that are vital for plant pollination are more likely to fail when they are used, a study showed on Sunday.The United Nations has estimated that a third of all plant-based foods eaten by people depend on bee pollination and scientists have been baffled by plummeting numbers of bees, mainly in North America and Europe, in recent years.British scientists said they exposed colonies of 40 bumblebees, which are bigger than the more common honeybee, to the pesticides neonicotinoid and pyrethroid over four weeks at levels similar to those in fields.Neonicotinoids are nicotine-like chemicals used to protect various crops from locusts, aphids and other pests.""Chronic exposure ... impairs natural foraging behavior and increases worker mortality, leading to significant reductions in brood development and colony success,"" the scientists wrote in the report in the journal Nature on Sunday.Exposure to a combination of the two pesticides ""increases the propensity of colonies to fail"", according to the researchers at Royal Holloway, University of London.A 2011 U.N. report estimated that bees and other pollinators such as butterflies, beetles or birds do work worth 153 billion euros ($200 billion) a year to the human economy and are in decline in many nations.The findings underscored the importance of wider testing of pesticides to ensure they do not also target bees, it said.France banned a neonicotinoid pesticide made by Swiss agrochemicals group Syngenta in June, citing evidence of a threat to the country's bees. A report last month, however, said that the original research was flawed.""My guess is that the decline of bees is like a jigsaw -there are probably a lot of pieces to put into place. This is probably a very important piece of that jigsaw,"" lead author Richard Gill told Reuters of the findings about pesticides.PARASITESIn a separate commentary in Nature, Juliet Osborne of the University of Exeter in England said the study underscored the need to understand all factors that may contribute to harm bees and to ""Colony Collapse Disorder"".""For example, we have as yet no convincing demonstration of the relative effects of pesticides on bee colonies compared to the effects of parasites, pathogens and foraging resources,"" she wrote.Gill endorsed recommendations by the European Food Safety Authority for longer testing on adult bees and larvae, new ways of assessing cumulative exposure to toxins and separate assessments for different bee species.He said previous studies had mostly examined the impact of pesticides on individual bees, rather than colonies. Bumblebees form colonies of a few dozen bees, while honeybees can number up to tens of thousands.""Effects at the individual level can have a major knock-on effect at the colony level. That's the novelty of the study,"" he said.The average number of bees lost in the experiment - both dead in the nesting box and failing to return - was about two-thirds of the total for bees exposed to a combination of the two pesticides against a third for a control, exposed to neither.Bumblebees exposed to a combination of pesticides were about half as successful at gathering pollen, used as food, compared to a control. They also devoted more workers to collecting food, meaning fewer were raising larvae.Other experts said more research was needed. ""It certainly wouldn't be fair to say that this research spells doom for wild bees,"" said James Cresswell of the University of Exeter.(Editing by Alison Williams)"

The Agricultural, Forest, and Open Space Act of 1976, (commonly referred to as the “Greenbelt Law”) provides for the assessment of agriculture, forest, and open space lands for tax purposes based on present use value rather than on market value, according to Knox County Property Assessor's Office. And Tennessee's super-rich -- from country music stars to former corporate executives -- are reportedly using the law to get big tax breaks, according to an investigation by The Knoxville News Sentinel and The Commercial Appeal. Read the full investigation here. The 1976 law was meant to help farmers and though it's not being broken exactly, these wealthy residents are ""simply bending it, shaping it, looking for a way to squeeze into its provisions,"" according to Chris Peck, editor of The Commercial Appeal.Judd manages to save $18,000 a year in county property taxes on her 545-acre, $3.9 million estate in Williamson County , a discount of 81 percent, because she calls her land a timber reserve. Roger Mick, the retired CFO of Nashville-based Hospital Corp. of America, enjoys a 64 percent savings in city and county property taxes.But Tennessee isn't the only place where the super-rich can take advantage of tax loopholes. Earlier this year, the IRS released a report that found that more 20,000 filers in 2009 with an adjusted gross income above $200,000 didn't owe any taxes that year. The percentage of affluent filers who owed no taxes was five times greater than in 2001. As David Callahan wrote, U.S. tax laws sometime seem to be designed to facilitate tax avoidance by the super wealthy. Tax breaks that disproportionately benefit the super-rich have also become a hot-button issue on the campaign trail. Many have criticized Republican candidate Mitt Romney's relatively low tax rate. Much of Romney's income -- like that of many wealthy Americans -- comes from investments, which are taxed at a much lower rate than other forms of income. "

It also risks,2012-10-21,"NEW YORK, NY - MAY 23: Marissa Mayer of Google speaks at TechCrunch Disrupt NYC 2012 day 3 at Pier 94 on May 22, 2012 in New York City. (Photo by Paul Zimmerman/Getty Images for TechCrunch/AOL)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb35a3d240000500097554a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Nadia Damouni and Alexei OreskovicSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Marissa Mayer, who earned a reputation for decisive action and intensity during her 13-year stint at Google Inc, has spent her first months as Yahoo Inc CEO quietly moving the Internet pioneer back to its roots in technology.Long torn between whether it should focus on media content or on tools and technologies, Yahoo under Mayer is being positioned firmly in the latter camp, according to sources inside and outside the company.Her hires, acquisition musings, and other early moves hint at an ambitious, technology-driven comeback plan designed to revitalize aging but well-trafficked properties such as Yahoo Mail, Yahoo Finance and Yahoo Sports.Yahoo has been criticized for allowing these sites to stagnate - they look very much like they did five years ago, and do not have many bells and whistles to encourage users to spend more time on them.Mayer, 37, wants to make Yahoo's properties much more interactive, on PCs and on mobile devices, using social media tools to personalize the user experience and new technology to boost advertising sales. Her well-known focus on user design is expected to result in a simpler, less-cluttered email and home page, one source said.Yahoo declined to comment for this article. Mayer, who gave birth to her first child weeks ago, will unveil details of her comeback plan when Yahoo reports quarterly results on Monday.Mayer's focus on technology in many ways reverses a course set by her predecessors, who had concentrated on media content deals, such as those that gave prime billing to Walt Disney Co's ABC News or CNBC, or to bring an original program starring actor Tom Hanks to its website.The new strategy is not without risks: it positions Yahoo squarely against Facebook Inc and Google. It also risks alienating a large, media-focused contingent that is already weakened by the departure of Ross Levinsohn, who had championed a media-centric approach when he was interim CEO before Mayer's arrival in July.Mayer has been meeting with Internet gurus including AOL Inc CEO Tim Armstrong, another ex-Googler; Silicon Valley lawyer Larry Sonsini; and Wall Street investment bankers, according to people familiar with the matter.Bankers have pitched Mayer and her team on a slew of potential acquisitions, and they appeared to show interest in restaurant reservation site OpenTable Inc and advertising technology companies PubMatic, Turn and Millennial Media, one of the people said.Caterva, a small start-up whose technology analyzes social media activity, has also been in low-level talks with Yahoo, said another source familiar with the situation.OpenTable and PubMatic declined comment. Millennial Media and Caterva did not respond to requests for comment.With more than $2 billion in cash and short-term securities, Yahoo has the money to acquire engineering talent or bolt-on services. Two types of deals are under consideration: companies that will increase user engagement, including on mobile, and those that will boost advertising returns, source said.""What they've signaled so far is that the deals will be more niche in nature, smaller deals that maybe have a lot of promise,"" said Ken Allen, a director at Blackstone Advisory Partners.TALENT HUNTMany industry insiders believe Mayer is Yahoo's final hope for reversing a years-long decline from the pinnacle it once attained as the leading gateway to the Internet. Four of her predecessors have tried in vain to right the ship - Yahoo's market value of $19 billion, is less than half its $44 billion value in 2005.Mayer, who earned a masters degree in computer science from Stanford University specializing in artificial intelligence, has moved quickly on the personnel front, shelling out rich pay packages to attract ex-colleagues from Google and elsewhere.She brought in ad technology systems guru Henrique de Castro as chief operating officer; a new finance chief in Ken Goldman, who also has tech chops, to replace Tim Morse; and Jacqueline Reese to assume the dual role of hiring and acquisitions, suggesting the start of a train of ""acqui-hires"" or buying small companies for their engineering talent.""She's spending almost all her time with the product folks. She's spending it on technology. She's talking about engineering hires,"" a person close to Yahoo said about Mayer's early days.Yahoo's advertising technology products, headed for the auction block before Mayer's arrival, are back in favor. De Castro, her highest-profile hire, is known for a deep-understanding of the complex advertising landscape, where dozens of businesses and technology providers are interlinked.Mayer has also shown an interest in the company's ad tech platform, including Right Media, an automated exchange that allows marketers to blast ads across a network of websites.The group has been a long-standing source of division among Yahoo's management, including with Levinsohn, who was keen on divesting the unit, according to two sources close to the matter. But shortly after Mayer's arrival, Yahoo told AdAge that it had no intention of selling Right Media.Yahoo's advertising salesforce, responsible for signing splashy home-page ad deals and premium marketing campaigns, has received scant attention from the new CEO, say people close to the company. Michael Barrett, Yahoo's chief revenue officer hired by Levinsohn shortly before Mayer's arrival, recently announced his resignation, according to a source familiar with the matter.FOCUS ON MOBILERoughly 700 million users visit a Yahoo website every month - putting it in the top ranks globally. But the amount of activity people engage in on many sites is steadily declining, and its smartphone offerings are deemed lackluster.""The largest change is to be deadly serious about mobile,"" said a former Yahoo manager who remains in touch with people at the company.Yahoo faces tough competition from Facebook and Google, two companies that have taken consumers' time, engineering talent and market value from Yahoo. They are also trying to make the transition to mobile, but it has been difficult.Some say the direction signaled by Mayer is not so different than strategies espoused by previous CEOs that Yahoo has consistently struggled to implement. A fragmented culture in which short-term finances usually trump product plans is to blame, according to those who know the company.The recent departure of CFO Tim Morse could signal a change in approach, said several former Yahoo employees.Morse was considered the force behind Chinese e-commerce company Alibaba Group and Yahoo's $7.6 billion deal over the summer, which saw Yahoo sell about half of its 40 percent stake in Alibaba after years of wrangling over terms.But now Yahoo's Asian partners, including Yahoo Japan Corp, are not on the front burner for Mayer, one source familiar with the situation said.Whether Wall Street has the patience for yet another Yahoo revival plan remains to be seen.""Every CEO needs time to have their full vision articulated and understood,"" said Dan Rosensweig, a former Yahoo chief operating officer, who now serves as CEO of online textbook rental company Chegg.com. ""To count Yahoo out would be an enormous mistake, because the users have not counted Yahoo out,"" he said. ""It's not like MySpace, where all the users went away.""(Reporting By Nadia Damouni in New York and Alexei Oreskovic in San Francisco; Editing by Edwin Chan, Jonathan Weber and Tiffany Wu)"
