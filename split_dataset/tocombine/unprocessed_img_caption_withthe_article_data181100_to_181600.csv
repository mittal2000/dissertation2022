But the way he delivers that advice makes it the most riveting personal finance book of the year. ""I'm trying to show the right ways to stack paper,"" he writes. As Moneyland pointed out, the rapper has been obsessed with bean counting since the recession began, as well as how the economic downturn has affected the black community.“I’m sick of this cycle,” Slim told MTV's RapFix in a recent interview. “We always at the bottom as black people.""While his personal finance advice is super solid and likely to save you some money if you follow his rules (e.g. save 50 percent of every check you earn), the actual cost of the ebook -- $9.99 -- is kind of steep for something not much longer than a pamphlet.We zeroed in on some of the most essential tidbits in our slideshow below: "

The U.S. economy grew at an annual rate of just 1.5 percent from April through June, less than the 2 percent rate in the first quarter. But many analysts say the economy hasn't slowed enough to compel the Fed to announce further help immediately. (AP Photo/David Goldman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c1a62240000510053132b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pay for your everyday purchases with a plain vanilla debit or credit card, and you could be leaving as much as 6 percent of your household budget in the cashier's till each month. Our survey of the market's best cash-back credit cards reminds us that you can earn some significant rebates, just by focusing your spending through the right account.Best cash back card for busy families: Blue Cash Preferred from American ExpressYour high credit score can earn you an invitation to one of the most consistently generous cash back credit cards ever offered. ""Preferred"" cardmembers enjoy 6 percent cash back at supermarkets, 3 percent cash back at gas stations and department stores, and 1 percent cash back on all other purchases. There's a $75 annual fee, but new cardmembers get a $150 statement credit after spending $1,000 during the first three months with the card.Don't lose hope if you've got one or two dings on your credit report. You may still qualify for the Blue Cash Everyday card. This no annual fee card features a cash back structure that still rivals the best credit cards on the market. Card members get 3 percent cash back at supermarkets, 2 percent cash back at gas stations and department stores, and 1 percent cash back on all other purchases. Best ""hands-off"" cash back cards: Capital One Cash RewardsWhile many cash-back credit cards require you to opt-in for the biggest rebates, Capital One Cash Rewards caters to consumers who like to ""set it and forget it."" Build your reward's base with a consistent, 1 percent rebate on all of your purchases, all year long. Make your payments on time each month for a year, and Capital One will kick in a bonus reward equal to half your accrued rewards.That's an annual maximum of 1.5 percent, a great reward if you don't follow any specific purchasing pattern. Best of all, Capital One's website makes it easy for you to cash in your rewards for statement credits, anytime. With no annual fee, this card makes a great companion to Blue Cash for those times when your merchant doesn't accept American Express.Best cash back card with flexible rewards: Chase Freedom VisaChase has spared no expense over the past few years, educating consumers about the benefits of its flagship cash back credit card. In building Freedom's rewards structure, it swiped the best elements of the Discover Card (rotating bonus categories) and eliminated the required spending thresholds. As a result, you get a no annual fee card with a consistent 1 percent rebate and up to 5 percent cash back on featured spending categories.But that's only part of the picture. Chase's Ultimate Rewards program powers Freedom's cash rebates. You can exchange your cash rewards for gift cards or merchandise that may almost double your earnings. If you're a really savvy shopper, you can even earn up to 20 percent cash back with merchants at Chase's online mall. A $100 signup bonus for spending $500 on the Chase Freedom Visa sweetens the deal.Best cash back card for focused shoppers: U.S. Bank Cash+ Visa SignatureThis year's hottest rookie cash-back card has already made a play to swipe market share from Discover and Chase. Every three months, U.S. Bank sends its Cash+ Visa Signature cardholders a text message reminder to choose two spending categories for 5 percent cash back and another for a 2 percent rebate. Although you have to pick gas, groceries or drug stores for your 2 percent quarterly bonus, U.S. Bank gives you a wide selection of merchant categories for your 5 percent deal.Time your purchase of airline tickets, appliances or computers to enjoy some of the biggest possible rebates. If you can stand to let your cash back rebate grow, U.S. Bank will even bump your maximum reward to 6.25 percent. Just wait to request a statement credit until you've accrued $100 in rebates. Ask for your reward after that, and the bank will kick in a bonus $25 gift card. With no annual fee and no earning restrictions, this card could end up paying out some of the biggest rebates on the market.  Best cash back card for back-to-school shopping: Citi Dividend Platinum Select Visa CardCiti's cash back credit card uses a reward structure similar to Chase's and Discover's, but ups the ante for families with high school and college students. Through the end of September, Citi's adding 5 percent cash back rewards for all purchases at Gap, Old Navy and Banana Republic locations, including their outlet stores. Airline tickets and car rental fees get the 5 percent bonus, too, rewarding parents who have to drive or fly their kids back to campus.After that deal expires, Citi keeps the 5 percent cash back rebate rolling with quarterly promotions on featured spending categories. In addition, everyday purchases earn 1 percent cash back. Citi sweetens the deal for new cardholders, adding a $150 cash back bonus after you spend $500 with the card. That's one of the lowest sign-up bonus thresholds in the business. Combined with a strong balance transfer deal and no interest for a year, the Dividend Platinum Select Visa proves that Citi's hungry to welcome back customers that defected to their competitors.Cash-back credit cards come with their own set of ground rules. Especially when you're not paying an annual fee, banks will usually notch your APR toward the high end of the spectrum. You'll really only get the most from these cards when you pay your bill in full at the end of each statement cycle. Otherwise, finance charges will eat most of your rebate. Pay your bills on time, too. Missing a payment could mean losing your accrued rebates. Just treat your new cash back credit card like it's the debit card connected to your checking account. That way, you'll enjoy bonus cash throughout the year.This article originally appeared on CardRatings.com: 5 Credit Cards to Turn Your Wallet into a Workhorse"

(AP Photo/Gregory Bull)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c1c4e3c0000660009a380.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Olympic gold medalist and defending all-around women's gymnastics world champion, Jordyn Wieber's lackluster performance in London has been a surprise throughout the games. The 17-year-old was expected to take home at least one individual gymnastics medal and to compete in the individual all-around, for which she didn't even qualify. Though as her coach revealed today, this could be due to an untreated stress fracture. As Jo-Ann Barnas reported for the Detroit Free Press: A spokesperson for USA Gymnastics said there hasn’t been a confirmed diagnosis of Wieber’s injury -- she hasn’t had an X-ray nor MRI exam -- but John Geddert, Wieber’s coach, said the unofficial diagnosis came from the “X-ray eyes” of team doctor Larry Nassar.As the AP reported, her injury may have been a problem as early as Olympic trials in San Jose in June. She had a sore right heel that may have contributed to her first loss during a meet in three years. A stress fracture is usually due to very small cracks in the bone that are caused by repetitive overuse and repeated force absorption (like, say, sticking a vault landing?). According to literature provided by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, fatigue is another factor: when muscles become too tired to help absorb shock, they transfer weight stress to the bone. Tennis, track and field, gymnastics, and basketball athletes are the most susceptible to stress fractures because they all have in common the repetitive movement of feet striking the ground. Most stress fractures occur in the feet and lower legs, where the bones bear the most weight. Of note, female athletes may be more susceptible to stress fractures. Explained the AAOS:Medical studies have shown that female athletes seem to experience more stress fractures than their male counterparts. Many orthopaedic surgeons attribute this to a condition referred to as ""the female athlete triad"": eating disorders (bulimia or anorexia), amenorrhea (infrequent menstrual cycle), and osteoporosis. As a female's bone mass decreases, her chances of getting a stress fracture increase.Indeed, among those who aren't elite athletes, some stress fractures may not be related to extreme physical activity and instead to bones weakened by osteoporosis. Those beginning a new fitness program are particularly susceptible, according to the Mayo Clinic. Of course, we don't yet know any of the specifics of Wieber's case. And despite this reported injury, she still goes home with the shared gold medal in all-around team. "

The Associated Press reported that cases of the virus are off to an early start -- with 241 in July alone, so far -- which may be the result of the early spring and hot summer. West Nile cases tend to be most common during the summer and fall, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 1999, there have been 13,000 cases of serious West Nile virus, and 1,200 deaths from the virus, the CDC reported. West Nile virus symptoms aren't always severe or apparent -- most people will not even know they have the virus, the Mayo Clinic reported. And in about one in five cases, the symptoms are mild (headache, fever or body aches) and go away by themselves. But rarely -- less than 1 percent of cases -- symptoms will be severe and require hospitalization. When the symptoms are extreme, inflammation of the brain (encephalitis), surrounding membranes or spinal cord (meningitis) can occur. When a case is serious, symptoms usually include having convulsions or tremors, confusion, terrible headache, high fever, paralysis of part of the body, and even coma, according to the Mayo Clinic. The CDC added that in these severe cases, symptoms can last weeks, and some of the effects may never go away. For most instances of West Nile virus that aren't serious, over-the-counter medicines can help with symptoms like headache or muscle aches, the Mayo Clinic reported. For more serious cases of West Nile that lead to encephalitis or meningitis, a person will need to receive treatment in a hospital to receive medicines and IVs. West Nile virus is only spread to humans from mosquito bites, and it's not contagious between people, according to the New York City Department of Health. Mosquitoes become carriers of the virus when they bite a bird that has the virus.The best way to protect yourself from West Nile is to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes, the CDC said. You can protect yourself by applying insect repellant, and doing your part to reduce mosquito breeding by getting rid of standing water, the New York City Department of Health said.
