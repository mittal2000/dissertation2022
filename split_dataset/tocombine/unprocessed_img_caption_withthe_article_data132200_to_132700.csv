We spent more than a decade working like dogs for our long running internet startup (which was finally acquired!) and now it was time to celebrate the sale of our company Splendora in true Splendora style. While Paris on a shoestring is an admirable goal, this story chronicles the opposite. Here's our list on where to stay, eat and play with a Queen's ransom.  Where to stay:  BUDDHA-BAR HOTEL PARIS 4 rue d'Anjou - 75008 PARIS +33 (0)1 83 96 88 88 I'm a firm believer that where you stay sets the tone for your trip and the Buddha-Bar Hotel Paris put us in the proper mood for the sensory delights that awaited. Bathed in hues of onyx and vermilion and tempered with contemporary European sophistication, the hotel is enveloped in a kind of permanent twilight -- a sultry welcome after a long day ... or night. The staff is also gorgeous, helpful and always smiling, not exactly the norm at other Parisian hotels. Amy and I splurged on a colossal three room Historic Suite, which included a spacious living room, dining table for 6, master bedroom and a bathroom as big as most hotel rooms. Its central location on Rue D'Anjou just across from the Tuileries and the Louvre made it a quick jaunt to museums, bridges and the Left Bank, not to mention the hotel's nearest cross street, Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, is the Madison Avenue of Paris. The Buddha-Bar Hotel Paris has all the sexy chic of Hotel Costes sans the attitude and pomposity. Our Moveable Feast:#ConnoisseursOnly JIN was my favorite restaurant in Paris and many weeks later I'm still thinking about my meal. It's an authentic Japanese experience and an absolute must for Japanophiles and sushi lovers. The space is intimate and seductive with room for only a dozen diners per seating. There's also a downstairs, but the bar is where you want to be.The set menu features courses that are presented, jewel-like, on beautifully crafted dishware. Every morsel unfolds with flavor especially the sea urchin and toro with smoked sea salt, which nearly brought me to tears. Every patron, like us, was unable to resist moans of ecstasy after every bite and every course. It's just that fresh. It's just that good. Reservations are a must.JIN ST. HONORE 6 rue de la Sourdière, 75001  011 33 1 42 61 60 71#TheInCrowd Monsieur Bleu is modern, metropolitan, and feels very Manhattan It's the hot, happening spot where the beautiful people dine and boasts a majestic view of La Tour Eiffel from the terrace where outdoor dining and cocktails are mandatory during warmer months. The menu is deliciously straightforward. We feasted on French caviar, champagne, oysters and a squid ink pasta and truffle risotto that was rich and flavorful. It's often booked weeks in advance so reserve before you go.Monsieur Bleu Restaurant, Bar, Mezzanine, Terrasse 20 Avenue de New York 75116, Paris tél: +331 47 20 90 47#ClassicElegance Marius et Janette has the best fish in Paris and a highbrow history of hosting epicures and dignitaries (the night we went we caught sight of former French President Jacques Chirac). Whet your palate with a platter of oysters then order the whole grilled fish crusted in sea salt. Pair it with a crisp white Cordonieu and polish it off with a plate of wild strawberries. Absolument divine! Just try not to swoon when the check arrives. Marius et Janette Réservation : 01 82 28 77 40 4, AVENUE GEORGE V 75008#HiddenGem Les Cartes Postales Here's a wonderful little spot very close to the Louvre that we found for lunch. What makes it special is the unique and delightful blending of French and Asian cuisine. We loved the fresh fish carpaccio delicately flavored with soy and vinegar as well as other dishes that were French in concept but not weighed down with cream and butter. The portions are also surprisingly large so if you're dining with a girlfriend, ask for a share plate or you'll never squeeze into that YSL later.Les Cartes Postales 7 Rue Gomboust  75001 Paris, France  01 42 61 02 93#Hipster Haven Le Chateaubriand is located in a section of Paris that's akin to the Mission in San Francisco or the Lower East Side in New York. Its no frills, Brooklyn-esque ambience combined with a slow cook philosophy may have impressed me more if I did not already frequent establishments like this in my own city. Each course was interesting and tasty but the earnest explanation about the origin of every dish and wine was a bit much for my jetlagged brain. However, many of my European friends were over the moon about the experience so I should probably return when I am well-rested and more patient.Le Chateaubriand 129 Avenue de Parmentier 75011 Paris 33 1 43 57 45 95Where to Drink:There were not enough hours in the night to swill cocktails but these three swanky watering holes: Le Mary Celeste, Candelaria and Glass come highly recommended by a chic, trusted source.We did, however, enjoy a late night at the posh, Russian themed Raspoutine, a former bordello turned nightclub where you'll rub elbows with models, millionaires and other exotic creatures canoodling over bottle service in red velvet upholstered booths and (if it's a wild night) dancing on table tops. To avoid hassles at the door make sure you go with a member or have your concierge call ahead and get a late dinner reservation. Action usually starts after midnight.For me a visit to Paris is not complete without a café crème at Café de Flore or Les Deux Magots. Both are tourist magnets and not exactly ""insider secrets"" but as an American I find it magical to think that at one time Hemingway, Fitzgerald, Picasso and many of my Modernist heroes frequented these same cafes. A Few Places to Shop:Nadine Delepine Make this sweet little boutique on the Left Bank your first stop and get gift buying out of the way. You can load up on handcrafted costume jewelry and girlie prezzies for family and friends that won't break the bank. I found something for every lady on my list from ages 5 to 75.Gianvito Rossi, son of the famed Sergio Rossi, is the new darling of the well-heeled. His designs are sexy, classic, and surprisingly comfortable though a pair might set you back around 400 €.Frederic Malle located across from Gianvito Rossi is a not-to-be-missed fragrance experience. All parfums are curated and hand crafted by artisans who have the best noses in the world. Reciproque on Rue du Pompe is the largest consignment store in Paris where you can find gently worn Chanel, Hermes, Lanvin and labels galore at a fraction of the cost.Bonpoint carries the most exquisite children's clothing and accessories and their boutique on rue de Tournon in St. Germain is an experience in itself. My American son wouldn't be caught dead in these fancy lad togs but my daughter felt like a princess in the leather bow flats and pearly pink velvet dress I found for her.Colette is where I let things got a little out of control with my purchase of a Comme des Garcons jacket. Make this your last day visit so you don't break the bank too early. And finally, you don't really need a fat bankroll to enjoy Paris. One of the best and most memorable things I did was totally free (at least for the first half hour). Simply check out one of the self-service bicycles located on most street corners (Velib) and pedal your way across one of the most beautiful cities in the world."

You might call it one of the exports and also one of its greatest natural resources since practically every other storefront in a city like Chiang Mai is a massage studio and that can make for a lot of studios in an urban center with a population over 1 million--massage that is, and elephants. Here in Northern Thailand there are statues of elephants everywhere. The elephant has a kind of sacred status and almost functioning as a deity, though not quite. The Hindu god Ganesha which some Thais have adopted was depicted with the head of an elephant and Thailand itself is shaped like one, with the trunk representing its southern most portions. There are as many statues of elephants as there are statues of the Buddha. But as you leave Chiang Mai and head into the mountains, you feel you are entering sacred territory, a land of temples and ancient tribal civilizations like that of the Lanna kingdom and the Hill Tribe peoples. Buddhist monks with their shaved heads and yellow robes are as ubiquitous in Chiang Mai as are streimels worn by the Hasidic Jews in Jerusalem. Parenthetically Chiang Mai has its own mini Jewish quarter replete with chabad, right along one of the major thoroughfares, Chang Klan Road. Despite the discos and karaoke's filled with bar girls, Chiang Mai, Chiang Rai and other cities of the North are religious territory in which the sacred and the spiritual coexist uneasily with the profane. Right outside of Chiang Rai is the Doi Tung Royal Villa, which was built by the mother of the current king. It's gardens are a Thai Giverny and inside are exhibits of sacred Buddhist objects. In the Buddhist conception the feet are low on the food chain with the brain and head at top. Perhaps traditional Thai massage which starts with the feet and ends with the head is a way uniting the high and the low.{This was originally posted to The Screaming Pope, Francis Levy's blog of rants and reactions ro contemporary politics, art and culture}"
2,WELLNESS,Study: Increased Healthcare Costs Would Cancel Out Savings From Slashing Food Stamps,Lydia O'Connor,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/food-stamp-diabetes-study_us_5b9dc5a6e4b03a1dcc8cafe0,"The issue is exacerbated by low-income people having a higher risk of diabetes in the first place, as healthier, high-nutrition",2014-01-09,"SAN FRANCISCO - NOVEMBER 23: Canned food sits on the shelf at the San Francisco Food Bank November 23, 2009 in San Francisco, California. As the U.S. continues to struggle through the recession and unemployment is at record highs, food banks are seeing an increased demand as the holiday season approaches. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dc5a61f0000510021bec9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Proposed slashes to monthly food stamp programs could cost more than they save, suggests a University of California, San Francisco study linking limited food access to increased healthcare costs.Published Monday in the journal Health Affairs, UCSF researchers found that California’s low-income population was more likely to be admitted to the hospital for hypoglycemia, a low-blood sugar condition linked to diabetes patients who continue to medicate without eating enough. Furthermore, risk for hypoglycemia admission in the low-income population increased 27 percent in the last week of the month compared to the first, while researchers observed no weekly difference among high-income Californians. “This is people going hungry, skipping meals and ending up in the hospital,” lead study author Hilary Seligman said of the low-income patients who may run out of food stamps at the end of each month. “From my perspective as a public health researcher, it’s cheaper to make sure people don’t get hungry than to deal with the far more expensive healthcare costs of not having access to food.”Hospital admission for hypoglycemia cost $1,200 per visit in 2003, she said, but that figure has likely risen. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. spends more than $100 billion a year treating the 25 million Americans -- 8 percent of the population -- with diabetes.The study comes as Congress continues debates this week over a House Republican-backed $40 billion cut to SNAP benefits, the food stamp program aiding 47 million Americans with $133 a month, an amount Seligman says is already not enough. “People who work minimum wage jobs or live on benefits often have this typical pay cycle pattern,” Dr. Seligman said, adding that she and her colleagues were aware of the Congressional debate. “We wanted to examine whether there were adverse health consequences to running out of money at the end of the month.”The issue is exacerbated by low-income people having a higher risk of diabetes in the first place, as healthier, high-nutrition diets are more expensive than diets that are high in fat and calories but low in nutrients. “Most of these admissions for hypoglycemia are preventable by people having a stable and reliable source of food,” Seligman told Forbes. “We see much worse blood sugar control among people who are food insecure. They go high, they go low, they go high, they go low.” In addition to hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, Seligman says patients could also rack up costs associated with kidney failure, amputation and seizures, all complications linked to having excessively high or low blood sugar."

Other tips warn hoteliers that Germans might seem ""aggressive"" and that people from Hong Kong, who are ""superstitious,"" might not be comfortable in certain rooms or beds. VisitBritain's marketing director told the Daily Mail his agency derived its list of tips from ""market intelligence reports"" which ""provide an unrivaled source of information on inbound tourism.""Maybe that ""unrivaled source of information"" should've been kept private. Some other potential hot spots in the do-and-don't guide refer to visitors from:India: ""Understand that Indians are amiable but have a tendency to change their minds quite frequently.""Germany and Austria: ""Deal promptly with any complaint from [these tourists], who can be 'straightforward and demanding' to the point of 'seeming rude and aggressive.'""Hong Kong: ""Don't ask superstitious people from Hong Kong to sleep in a historic property or a four-poster bed, because they associate them with ghostly encounters.""Japan: ""Don't say 'no' in a direct way to a Japanese tourist -- instead think of a 'nicer alternative.'""Russia: ""Ensure tourists from Russia -- a 'tall nation' -- are housed in rooms with high ceilings and doorways.""We didn't find evidence of any tips on dealing with Americans... and we'll take that as a compliment."
