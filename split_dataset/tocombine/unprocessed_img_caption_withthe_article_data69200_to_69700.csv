From business cards to your LinkedIn summary, personal branding can make a positive impact on how you present yourself to others. Effective personal branding can even help you land your dream job. An often overlooked way to showcase what you bring to the table lies in your email signature. Below are seven quick methods of making your email signature more unique and creative.Add a photo. Leave the boring text behind and add a visual element to your signature. You can easily insert a professional headshot or logo from your current school, internship, or job. Choosing a creatively targeted visual that best depicts your personal brand can add value to the overall message of your email.Create a direct call-to-action. If you're a professional, target your audience skillfully by building buzz about an upcoming event or new job opening. If you're a college student, try a personalized networking hook: ""Want to get coffee? Email (or call) me at ___.""Link to social media accounts. Depending on your personal brand, you may want to direct people you connect with to your Twitter or Instagram account. If you're actively seeking employment and have a strong LinkedIn profile, add the link to the bottom of your email to help connections learn more about your skills. Insert your actual signature. Save a photo of your handwritten signature to put at the end of your emails. This will add a personal touch and stand out against the words on the page. Add a quote. Is there a motivational quote out there that helps you strive to succeed? Put it in your email signature to show what's important to you or a goal you may be trying to reach. Create a professional headline. Right after your name, come up with 3-5 words that best depict your field, values or profession. Examples could be something like ""Branding | Consulting | Design"" or ""Aspiring PR Professional.""Link to a recent published piece. Pull one blog post from your portfolio to showcase in you email signature (i.e. ""Read my latest post on The Huffington Post here."") Make sure to keep it updated with your latest work."

To do this, we will need a powerful voice in the White House with the experience and leadership to keep moving us in this direction. That is one reason why I am supporting Hillary Clinton for the presidency.",2015-12-26,"BETTENDORF, IA - DECEMBER 22: Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton speaks to campaign volunteers at a United Steelworkers Union Hall on December 22, 2015 in Bettendorf, Iowa. Clinton spent the day campaigning in Iowa, and during her final event of the day thanked local volunteers and campaing staff for their support. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb92a5525000094003a6b4a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It was more than six years ago when I stood on the floor of the House of Representatives to cast one of the most significant votes of my early Congressional career. My colleagues and I were about to pass the American Clean Energy and Security Act, sweeping energy reform legislation that would set new standards for energy efficiency, prioritize clean energy production, take steps to reduce carbon emissions, and help the United States transition to a clean energy economy.At the time this was the most serious effort by the federal government to combat climate change, one of the defining issues facing current and future generations. Unfortunately, it was short lived because while legislation passed the House, it lacked the 60 votes needed in the Senate and effectively tabled for the foreseeable future. Instead of listening to scientists and experts who say it is beyond time that we take action to curb the effects of climate change, Republicans in Congress have wasted years choosing to look the other way; protecting the interests of oil companies over the health and safety of the American public and the environment.Luckily we've seen President Obama dedicate much of his second term to raising awareness on climate policy, and using his executive authority to advance a climate policy that sets levels for emissions standards, paired with investments in clean power to lay the foundation for the United States to get more of its energy supply from renewable sources while providing a positive economic benefit.We stand at a pivotal moment when it comes to the climate crisis that threatens our health, economy, security and our way of life. If our country is truly going to be a leader when it comes to advancing solutions, we will need to build on prior executive actions and have the courage to take them a step further. To do this, we will need a powerful voice in the White House with the experience and leadership to keep moving us in this direction. That is one reason why I am supporting Hillary Clinton for the presidency.  As a scientist and renewable energy expert, whose work in wind energy contributed to saving the equivalent of approximately 30 million barrels of oil, or 8.3 million tons of carbon dioxide, I am familiar with the kind of bold leadership that is required to make a real impact. Hillary's drive, vision, and policy muscle make her the most qualified American today to lead this country in the fight to reduce emissions and turn the United States into a clean energy superpower. Hillary is setting an aggressive, forward-thinking national energy agenda that aims to double down on the progress we've seen over the last several years.  Hillary's vision includes new levels of investment in renewable energy with the installation of more than half a billion solar panels across the nation at the close of her first term as president. She also aims for the United States to generate enough clean, renewable energy to power every American home within 10 years of her assuming the presidency. This sets the ambitious goal of having 33 percent of U.S. electricity come from renewable sources by the start of 2027. Achieving these goals will set a new precedent for the nation's grid capacity to produce power from renewable sources through a mix of wind, solar, hydro, geothermal, and other sources of electricity. Boosting this capacity will reduce our dependence on fossil fuels, reduce air pollution, and dramatically cut down the thousands of asthma attacks and related deaths we see each year. Hillary's leadership will help our country chart a new path toward greater sustainability, energy independence, and a clean energy future.Now, Hillary proposes to meet these goals by spurring American innovation through a clean energy challenge. One focus of this challenge will be transforming our nation's electric grid to bring it into the 21st Century. I believe that modernizing our energy infrastructure and understanding our energy-water nexus is critical to the safety and security of our entire power system. We need to make improvements to the grid that strengthen its reliability and resilience, offer more consumer choice and value, and optimize it to meet the needs of a growing clean energy economy.Hillary Clinton's commitment to a more sustainable energy future should not surprise anyone. In the U.S. Senate she championed policies to target polluters that endanger the air we breathe and the water we drink, and supported legislation to invest in more alternative energy sources that emit less carbon. As Secretary of State, she prioritized climate and energy policy as key national security issues, which included diplomatically elevating climate change with China, and spearheaded a global initiative with over 100 countries and partners to reduce emissions -helping set the stage for the historic international climate accord agreed to in Paris by nearly 200 countries.I have no doubt that Hillary Clinton will demonstrate the same level of determination, smarts, and collaboration as president to lead the United States toward greater energy security and a cleaner, healthier environment for us all.

It all links back to the polar vortex, the surge of cold air that hit the U.S. several winters ago, causing temperatures to plunge far below zero.A band of cold air called the ""Arctic Oscillation"" surrounds the northern latitudes of the globe. Usually, the oscillation spins quickly and traps most of the cold air around the pole, but sometimes the band will slow and some of that cold will slip downwards, which is what happened during the polar vortex.The opposite is happening now, and that oscillation is moving far faster, keeping all the cold air trapped north and making temperatures in parts of America warmer, according to the National Weather Service.The bizarre swings have obliterated long-held records, and places like Albany, New York -- usually blanketed under snow -- were warmer than Phoenix at 72 degrees.

We are walking around the perimeter of Moria Camp, a temporary settlement for migrants and refugees, distributing solar lights and donated warm scarves.There are fires burning everywhere and families sleep on the ground. Some with just blankets, some in tents. They huddle. The smoke is acrid because there’s nothing left to burn but plastic.We come up on a tentless family. Three young women, the grandmother and five young children. One of the young women has a five-month-old baby in her arms. The men are buying food at a nearby truck. We give them scarves.Through an interpreter, they tell us their house was blown up in Syria. They don’t know by whom. It doesn’t matter to them. It's gone.We go to find them a place for the night. On the way, a young Moroccan man, speaking good English, tells us about two pregnant women in distress. When we get to their fire, one is standing, doubled over in pain, possibly having contractions. She is eight months pregnant. We call for transportation to take her to the Moria Medical Center on the other side of the camp.She resists at first. She doesn’t want to have her baby here.

Rebels blamed Russian sophisticated spying planes which they say rarely leave their skies.A rebel source said the group had chosen one of their top military commanders, Abu Hammam al Buwaidani, as their new head.""Alloush's martyrdom should be a turning point in the history of the revolution and rebel groups should realize they are facing an war of extermination and uprooting by (Russian President Vladimir) Putin's regime,"" said Labib al Nahhas, a senior figure in the main Ahrar al-Sham rebel group.Jaysh al Islam has effectively been running the administration of the Eastern Ghouta area since 2013, when the group was formed from an amalgamation of scores of rebel brigades.The rebels said Alloush was killed while holding a meeting with other rebel leaders in the Marj area of al-Ghouta, which has been the target of a major Syrian assault in the last few weeks.Jaysh al Islam was one of the main rebel groups that attended a recent Saudi-backed opposition meeting in Riyadh and will be part of a negotiating team that is expected to hold talks with Assad's government in Geneva.Before setting up Jaysh al Islam, Alloush had founded Liwa al-Islam, or the Brigade of Islam, with his father Abdallah, a Salafist Syrian cleric based in Saudi Arabia. He had a postgraduate degree in religious studies from a Saudi university.Alloush, who was released by the Syrian authorities at the start of the conflict in 2011 when it let scores of Islamist detainees go free, had been criticized for a crackdown on dissidents in the areas he controlled.Activists accused him of kidnapping several prominent figures.Alloush was ideologically at odds with Islamic State and al Qaeda, espousing a more moderate brand of Islam. He fought against more militant Islamists and drove them out of his territory. He had dozens of jihadists locked up behind bars.Syria has long accused Saudi Arabia of financing arms and other supplies to Alloush. But there have also been reports that while on regional visits to countries hostile to Assad's government including Turkey and Saudi Arabia, Alloush failed to win the support he wanted for his group.Al-Ghouta has been under siege for years and has been the target of some of the most intensive raids on civilians living in the once heavily populated area.A chemical gas attack in Ghouta in August 2013 that the United States said killed 1,400 people and which the West blamed on forces loyal to Assad prompted the threat of Western military intervention in the country.Much of the capital remains firmly in President Assad's control.

Das, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/modi-visit-pakistan_us_567d5ecae4b014efe0d83168,It was the first time an Indian premier has visited the rival nation in over a decade.,2015-12-25,Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a surprise stopover in Pakistan on Friday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58757924120000c301ad6dcb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ISLAMABAD/NEW DELHI, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a surprise stopover in Pakistan on Friday to meet his counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, the first time an Indian premier has visited the rival nation in over a decade.The visit, requested by Modi just hours earlier before he flew back home from Afghanistan, raised hopes that stop-and-start negotiations between the nuclear-armed neighbors might finally make progress after three wars and more than 65 years of hostility.Sharif hugged Modi after he landed at the airport in the eastern city of Lahore and the two left by helicopter for Sharif's nearby family estate.""So, you have finally come,"" Sharif told Modi, according to a Pakistani foreign ministry official who was at the meeting.""Yes, absolutely. I am here,"" Modi replied, according to the official.Modi phoned Sharif earlier in the day to wish him on his birthday and asked if he could make a stop in Pakistan on his way home, Pakistan's top diplomat, Foreign Secretary Aizaz Chaudhry, told reporters.""And the PM said to him, 'Please come, you are our guest, please come and have tea with me',"" he said.It was Sharif's 66th birthday and the family home was festooned with lights for his grand-daughter's wedding on Saturday. Modi and Sharif talked for about 90 minutes and shared an early-evening meal before the Indian leader flew back home.""Among the decisions taken was that ties between the two countries would be strengthened and also people-to-people contact would be strengthened so that the atmosphere can be created in which the peace process can move forward,"" Chaudhry said.Modi was on his way home after a visit to Russia. He stopped off in the Afghanistan capital Kabul earlier on Friday, where he inaugurated a new parliament complex built with Indian help.The Lahore visit comes after India and Pakistan resumed high-level contacts with a brief conversation between Sharif and Modi at climate change talks in Paris late last month, part of efforts to restart a peace dialog plagued by militant attacks and long-standing distrust.A spokesman at Sharif's office earlier told Reuters the two leaders were to discuss a range of bilateral issues, including the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, the most contentious issue dividing the nuclear-armed rivals.A close aide to Modi said the visit was a spontaneous decision by the prime minister and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, and that it should not be seen as a sudden shift in India's position.""But yes, it's a clear signal that active engagement can be done at a quick pace,"" the aide said, declining to be identified.DEEP MISTRUSTMistrust between India and Pakistan runs deep. Modi's visit is the first by an Indian prime minister to Pakistan since the 2008 Mumbai attacks in which 166 people were killed in the Indian city by militants trained in Pakistan.The two countries were born out of British colonial India in 1947, divided into Hindu-majority India and Islamic Pakistan.Modi, a Hindu nationalist, came to power in 2014, and has authorized a more robust approach to Pakistan, giving security forces the license to retaliate forcefully along their disputed border and demanding an end to insurgent attacks in Indian territory.In Afghanistan, many believe that Islamabad sponsors the Taliban insurgency to weaken the Kabul government and limit the influence of India.Pakistan rejects the accusation but it has struggled to turn around perceptions in Afghanistan, where social media users sent out a stream of glowing commentary on Modi's visit, contrasting the parliament building with the destruction wrought by Taliban suicide bombers.Nalin Kohli, a spokesman for Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, said in New Delhi that India was ready to take two steps forward if Pakistan took one to improve ties.The opposition Congress Party called Modi's visit irresponsible and said that nothing had happened to warrant warming of ties between the rivals. Scheduled high-level talks between the two were canceled in August after ceasefire violations across the border.""If the decision is not preposterous then it is utterly ridiculous,"" Congress leader Manish Tewari said.Opening the parliament building in Kabul, Modi pledged India's support for the Afghan government and urged regional powers, including Pakistan, to work together to foster peace.""We know that Afghanistan's success will require the cooperation and support of each of its neighbors,"" he said.

I am here,"" Modi replied, according to the official.Modi phoned Sharif earlier in the day to wish him on his birthday and asked if he could make a stop in Pakistan on his way home, Pakistan's top diplomat, Foreign Secretary Aizaz Chaudhry, told reporters.""And the PM said to him, 'Please come, you are our guest, please come and have tea with me',"" he said.It was Sharif's 66th birthday and the family home was festooned with lights for his grand-daughter's wedding on Saturday. Modi and Sharif talked for about 90 minutes and shared an early-evening meal before the Indian leader flew back home.""Among the decisions taken was that ties between the two countries would be strengthened and also people-to-people contact would be strengthened so that the atmosphere can be created in which the peace process can move forward,"" Chaudhry said.Modi was on his way home after a visit to Russia. He stopped off in the Afghanistan capital Kabul earlier on Friday, where he inaugurated a new parliament complex built with Indian help.The Lahore visit comes after India and Pakistan resumed high-level contacts with a brief conversation between Sharif and Modi at climate change talks in Paris late last month, part of efforts to restart a peace dialog plagued by militant attacks and long-standing distrust.A spokesman at Sharif's office earlier told Reuters the two leaders were to discuss a range of bilateral issues, including the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir, the most contentious issue dividing the nuclear-armed rivals.A close aide to Modi said the visit was a spontaneous decision by the prime minister and National Security Adviser Ajit Doval, and that it should not be seen as a sudden shift in India's position.""But yes, it's a clear signal that active engagement can be done at a quick pace,"" the aide said, declining to be identified.DEEP MISTRUSTMistrust between India and Pakistan runs deep. Modi's visit is the first by an Indian prime minister to Pakistan since the 2008 Mumbai attacks in which 166 people were killed in the Indian city by militants trained in Pakistan.The two countries were born out of British colonial India in 1947, divided into Hindu-majority India and Islamic Pakistan.Modi, a Hindu nationalist, came to power in 2014, and has authorized a more robust approach to Pakistan, giving security forces the license to retaliate forcefully along their disputed border and demanding an end to insurgent attacks in Indian territory.In Afghanistan, many believe that Islamabad sponsors the Taliban insurgency to weaken the Kabul government and limit the influence of India.Pakistan rejects the accusation but it has struggled to turn around perceptions in Afghanistan, where social media users sent out a stream of glowing commentary on Modi's visit, contrasting the parliament building with the destruction wrought by Taliban suicide bombers.Nalin Kohli, a spokesman for Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party, said in New Delhi that India was ready to take two steps forward if Pakistan took one to improve ties.The opposition Congress Party called Modi's visit irresponsible and said that nothing had happened to warrant warming of ties between the rivals. Scheduled high-level talks between the two were canceled in August after ceasefire violations across the border.""If the decision is not preposterous then it is utterly ridiculous,"" Congress leader Manish Tewari said.Opening the parliament building in Kabul, Modi pledged India's support for the Afghan government and urged regional powers, including Pakistan, to work together to foster peace.""We know that Afghanistan's success will require the cooperation and support of each of its neighbors,"" he said. ""And all of us in the region - India, Pakistan, Iran and others - must unite in trust and cooperation behind the common purpose and in recognition of our common destiny.""As well as the parliament building, India is also supplying three Russian-made Mi-35 helicopters to Afghanistan's small air force, adding badly needed capacity to provide close air support to its hard-pressed security forces.(Additional reporting by Mubasher Bukhari in LAHORE; James Mackenzie in KABUL, Rupam Jain Nair and Sankalp Phartiyal in NEW DELHI; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)"

",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/58757a3117000088019295fe.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"BEIRUT, Dec 25 (Reuters) - Two thousand Syrian Islamist fighters are expected to be evacuated soon from besieged, rebel-held areas of southern Damascus in a deal brokered by the United Nations, a Hezbollah TV station said on Friday.The deal marks a success for the government of President Bashar al-Assad, increasing its chances of reasserting control over a strategic area just 4 km (2.5 miles) south of the center of the capital.It also highlights the increasing efforts of the U.N. and foreign governments to bring about local ceasefires and safe-passage agreements as steps towards the wider goal of ending Syria's civil war, in which more than 250,000 people have been killed in nearly five years of fighting.The besieged militants include fighters of Islamic State and the Nusra Front, al Qaeda's offshoot in Syria. Hezbollah's Manar TV said 18 buses had arrived to start taking them and 1,500 family members to areas under the control of IS and other rebel groups. It was not clear whether the buses were provided by the U.N. or by the Syrian army.The rebels' capitulation was forced by a government siege over several years that squeezed the flow of food and humanitarian aid, starving many people to death in what rights group Amnesty International has described as war crimes.Manar said the fighters would also be handing in their heavy weapons to the Syrian army under what it said was a multi-party deal under U.N. auspices.Manar is the official mouthpiece of Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shi'ite group which is a major ally of Assad and has sent its forces to fight alongside government troops.It later said the evacuation ""awaited completion of some arrangements.""Separately, the Syrian army said on Friday it had fought its way close to the strategic, rebel-held Aleppo-Damascus highway - its latest gain in a major offensive supported by Iranian-backed Shi'ite militias and Russian air power.The government and its allies are pressing towards the northwestern province of Idlib, which borders Turkey and is controlled by a coalition of Islamist groupings called Jaish al Fateh. Its capture would deal a major blow to the insurgents, who have been losing ground since Russia launched its aerial bombing campaign in support of the Assad government on Sept. 30. LOCAL DEALSIn a separate development, a British-based monitoring group said the last of some 200 Nusra Front fighters operating in Deraa province in the south had been given safe passage by the Syrian authorities to leave for rebel-controlled Idlib.Damascus agreed to the move in return for the release of Iranian officers captured by Nusra while fighting alongside the Syrian army, said Rami Abdulrahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights.The south Damascus and Deraa deals followed an earlier local truce in Zabadani on the Lebanese border, and an agreement allowing rebels to leave a besieged part of the city of Homs, which the U.N. said could help pave the way for a nationwide truce.The U.N. Security Council on Dec. 18 unanimously approved a resolution endorsing an international road map for a Syrian peace process, a rare show of consensus among major powers.Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem said on Thursday that Damascus was ready to take part in peace talks in Geneva and hoped that the dialog would help it form a national unity government. The U.N. plans to convene the Geneva talks towards the end of January.(Reporting by Suleiman Al-Khalidi; Editing by Mark Trevelyan)Also on HuffPost: "

Born and raised in a small town in eastern Oklahoma, Jennifer is a Magna Cum Laude graduate of Oklahoma State University with a BA in English. Jennifer BarkerQ: What does entrepreneurship mean to you, and what underlying characteristics do you see in successful entrepreneurs?Jennifer: To me, entrepreneurship means being willing to take risks and at times make sacrifices for the ideas and goals you believe in. While entrepreneurs are generally very innovative, I believe it's their bravery and perseverance that sets them apart from others in their field. It takes a brave person to put their career and/or financial resources on the line and seize an opportunity to make a real difference in the world.Q: What are you most proud of in your professional career? If you could do something over in your life, what would it be?  Jennifer: In my professional career, I am most proud of my decision to co-found and serve as CEO of Per Diems Against Poverty. To be honest, the thought was very overwhelming at first. I questioned my ability to perform the duties of CEO and live up to the standards of the nonprofit corporation we'd created. I could have ignored the call I felt inside and chosen to stay in my comfort zone, but I knew that leading our fight against hunger in America. is what I was meant to do. If I could do something over in my life, I wish I would have tried to live in NYC for at least a year. After my undergrad at Oklahoma State, I moved to NY for grad school but quickly learned that it wasn't for me. I loved the energy of Manhattan; however, I am a southerner at heart. I think I would have learned a lot more about myself had I stuck it out a bit longer.Q: Tell me about an instance where you had to go against the flow to realize your goal.Jennifer: I knew from a young age that I was called to serve others. While I worked in corporate administration and marketing for years, deep down I always felt the need to make a positive impact in my community. I was presented with the opportunity to lead marketing and PR for a private education institution. This job allowed me to work in the field of education, which I am very passionate about, and impact the lives of children in my community. Everyone around me, including myself and my new employer, thought I was crazy for giving up my successful corporate career. My new boss almost didn't hire me because he didn't trust my judgment. I never looked back, though. That was the right decision and helped me realize my desire to lead and work in an environment where compassion is the most important prerequisite.Q: What drives you at Per Diems Against Poverty?Jennifer: It's unfathomable that there are currently 49 million hungry Americans, including 15.3 million children and 9 million seniors. Most people view these numbers as an unfortunate condition affecting a minority of Americans; however, we view these numbers as a HUGE, solvable problem in our country. While several anti-hunger organizations exist to alleviate this burden endured by millions, we are the only anti-hunger nonprofit seeking to reallocate 100% of donated per diems from individuals and corporations to help provide food for Americans struggling with hunger. 100% of all donations go to our partner, Feeding America, because we are determined to see the day when no American goes hungry. Per Diems are a previously untapped resource of funds used to fight hunger, and it is conceivable that together, with our generous donors and partners, we can end hunger in America.   Q: What advice would you give to your 22 year old self?   Jennifer: If I could give advice to my 22-year-old self, I would tell her to take more chances. I've always been the cautious one in my family, afraid of making a mistake or not living up to expectations. I now know that passing on some of the opportunities I've had out of fear was a form of failure itself-- failure to meet my true potential and learn many valuable lessons along the way.

The conference is being co-sponsored by the British Academy for the humanities and social sciences. While specific details of the event have not yet been announced, I'm told that many of the 50 or so scientists associated with The Third Way of Evolution -- who I call ""The Paradigm Shifters"" -- will attend, one commenting to me about the upcoming meeting:  ""The bandwagon is therefore quite definitely rolling."" Paul Nurse has been thinking about these matters for some time. As president of Rockefeller University, for example, he presided over a pivotal evolution symposium in 2008  --open to the public -- featuring Jack Szostak, Eugene Koonin et al., and that summer at the World Science Festival said the following:""Maybe biology is on the edge of something similar to 1905 physics with the emerging complexity of biological systems -- in fact, a move from straight forward linear causality. And I wonder whether biology may go through a revolution in the coming decades.""Nurse made these remarks about evolutionary biology during a conversation with me for a 2008 book interview: ""Paul Nurse: It may require a different sort of language, by which I mean, quite often what biologists do is make interaction maps. Does A touch B touch C touch D and so on.Nurse also told me he thought it was ""very important for science and scientists to be talking to the general public."" Let's hope Venki Ramakrishnan feels the same way and that the Royal Society considers the Rockefeller University and 2013 NASA/Princeton Origins of Life  conferences a precedent, invites the media and streams the proceedings over the Internet. . ."

Why? Because I'm referring to the dictionary definition of black as ""full of anger or hatred.""Black words are purposely chosen for maximum impact. They cut deep, linger in the air, and endure in one's consciousness. I'm sure several examples have already popped into your mind - perhaps the N-word, some misogynist adjectives and nouns describing women, or ethnic slurs that span multiple continents. But those black words are easy to recognize and avoid. Those are not the black words I'm most concerned about.The most dangerous and insidious black words are those that appear innocuous. Words whose denotation is factual and reasonable but whose connotations represent a fomenting cauldron of exclusion, repression, and hate. Those connotations are communicated via the broad context of place and purpose, the speaker's tone of voice, or the words that immediately precede or follow.""Refugee,"" ""illegals,"" and ""Muslim"" are the best current examples of how disparate the literal meaning of a word can be to its implication. Refugee used to mean the ""huddled masses"" who came to the U.S. as their last best hope. Now it's become a form of NIMBY, fear-mongering nationalism. Illegals used to refer to people who were ""in a country without official authorization."" One could argue it still means that today, but it also means dark-skinned criminals and rapists who are stealing American jobs and destroying our culture. And Muslim, of course, literally refers to followers of Islam. As used by reactionary zealots, however, it means 1.6 billion non-Christians intent on death and destruction to all things non-Islamic.At this point it's only fair to give equal time to the black words often employed by the more liberal side of the political spectrum. ""Evangelical"" is defined as a wing of Christianity that views the Bible as the literal word of God. Now it's often used to demean Southerners and Midwesterners who are pro-life and against gay marriage. The term ""1%"" refers to the top one-percent of earners. Today it's spit out as an epithet for a culture of greed and corruption. And ""climate deniers"" refers to people who do not believe the earth is warming and/or do not believe it's caused by human activity. As used by many on the left, however, it means anyone who receives campaign contributions from the Koch brothers and/or hails from an energy-producing region of the country.Martin Luther King Jr. told us, ""Racism is evil because its ultimate logic is genocide."" Today's corollary is this: ""Black words are evil because their ultimate logic is fear, loathing, disrespect, and oppression."" Black words are sometimes delivered with a wink and a nod. Sometimes with a smirk or Cheshire grin. And almost always with a clear and present understanding of the inference the speaker is hoping to engender. Black words serve as a proselytizing shorthand that allow one to quickly backtrack and take shelter beneath the refuge of the literal meaning.No one can know for sure exactly what resides in a person's heart when he or she uses black words. I'm tempted to suggest ""no one can be sure except for the speaker,"" but I don't believe that's always the case. The first time someone turns ""Mexican"" or ""born-again"" into an insult, it's certainly intentional. Over time, however, it simply becomes part of the vernacular. The surprising becomes commonplace. The overt becomes nuanced. People become desensitized to the feelings and interpretations of themselves and others. It quickly becomes a mixed metaphor of vicious circles, slippery slopes, and rabbit holes with no light at the end of the tunnel.Black words matter today more than ever. In what we say or write. At home. In the workplace. In the community. We are what we say."
24,WORLDPOST,They Went To School and Never Came Back: Remembering the Peshawar School Massacre,"Sabreena Razaq Hussain, Contributordoctor, writer, activist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/they-went-to-school-and-n_b_8809682.html,"Classrooms were turned into bloodbaths as these evil creatures stormed from room to room gunning down children at point blank, and torching teachers and students alive in front of one another.",2015-12-25,2015-12-15-1450173799-7071705-PakistanPeshawar_3140947c.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-12-15-1450173799-7071705-PakistanPeshawar_3140947c-thumb.jpg," The image that became viral. Two friends stand next to empty spaces where their best friends once stood. Image taken from Talha Munir Paracha/Facebook.On perhaps the darkest day in Pakistan's history, December 16, 2014, seven armed terrorists stormed an army high school in Peshawar on a killing spree, murdering at least 141 students and teachers. Classrooms were turned into bloodbaths as these evil creatures stormed from room to room gunning down children at point blank, and torching teachers and students alive in front of one another.Television channels were rapidly saturated with soul destroying images of blood stained children running for their lives, and parents losing all sanity in desperation to see their children amongst those running out alive. The nation watched in horror as the most painful and torturous ordeal they had the misfortune to witness unfolded in front of them.Every mother's heart bled, every father's stance trembled. Every child in Pakistan was under attack. A blood stained classroom after the massacre. Image taken from the BBC.Pictures of books soaked in blood and bodies of children piled on top of one another as they lay dead in their classrooms are amongst many images that still haunt the nation today. Harrowing accounts of children and the mourning of bereaved parents shook the firmest of composures. ""You can't imagine that those small bodies I am burying since yesterday felt much heavier than those big ones I had buried previously,"" shared a gravedigger form Peshawar.A father clutched a shoe in his hand, recalling tying up his son's shoelaces that morning. ""I have the shoe,"" he cried, ""but I have no son."" One mother wept for her son who did not have breakfast that morning.Relatives mourn over the dead as the bodies of their children arrived in coffins. Image taken from the International Business Times.In the wake of this tragedy of monumental scale, the country, already troubled by terrorist attacks of smaller scales, immediately huddled together as one. Personal, political, religious and regional differences were put aside and they stood firmly under one green and white flag. As one nation the attacks were condemned, victims and bereaved supported and nationwide prayers and candlelight vigils held.It was the second biggest school massacre recorded in the world. It may not have grabbed the attention of worldwide media for more than a few days, or qualified for a Facebook filter, but in Pakistan social media became consumed by the massacre and heartache. Neighboring countries and those afar shared their sentiments through candlelight vigils. Soon after, a heart-wrenching song was released on national television, sung by young children, addressing the terrorists who committed the heinous atrocity.The English translation lyrics, are as follow:Where is he searching for me? I will be found in my books I will be found in the promises I have made to my mother I am the future to come, how can he kill me today? He must be delusional to think he can kill my dreams I have fought well, for I am your blood I have showed the enemy I am bigger than him I am from a nation whose children scare him He thinks he is a fierce enemy but (in fact) fights with children When you hugged me when I left (dear mother) You sent me with God's peace and called me your son From where did he come in the path of God's peace? He came (dear mother) as near as (my forehead) where you kissed me I am from a nation whose children scare him He thinks he is a fierce enemy but (in fact) fights with children I have had to go but my brother is here now (My brother) will now study all that I could not My father is also here, how far can you go? This is now a promise that you will never be able to come here again I am from a nation whose children scare him He thinks he's a fierce enemy but (in fact) fights with childrenThe children that went to school that day and never came back have made their place in the history books of their country, and in the hearts and prayers of millions. Pakistan pays tribute to the brave survivors, the bereaved families and the brave SSG Commandos - especially the Captain who even after he was injured and only semi-conscious, refused to let his fighting hand loose. Picture: SSG Commando Captain Abid Zaman who took out numerous terrorists before his injuries, lies semi-conscious, but still grasping his gun.Soon after the attack, the Pakistani army increased its offensive, launching an operation to target the perpetrators. Terrorist attacks have decreased significantly since. But these parents, and the families of all victims of terror around the word, are never going to see their children or loved ones smile again. They are not going to walk from one room to another and see them sat there busy in what they would normally be doing. Even if they gathered together all the riches of the world, or approached the superpowers of superpowers, they will never get to feel the warmth of their skin again.It is times like these where many in Pakistan reflect on the words of popular school and national anthems to empower them and provide hope through such testing times. One, particularly echoic of images of all the candlelight vigils across the country, is often used as a lullaby:Mauj barhay ya aandi aye, diya jalai rakhna heh Come high tide or storm, we must keep the candle alightGhar ki khatir sau dukh jhelay, ghar tau akhir apna heh We may pain or suffer, but it is for our own homePakistan Zindabad, Pakistan Zindbad Long live Pakistan, long live PakistanSleep peacefully oh children of Peshawar."

And this year, the NBA is giving its fans an amazing holiday gift: a full slate of games featuring the sport's top players, including Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook, Anthony Davis, and Stephen Curry and LeBron James in a rematch of last year's NBA Finals.On this week's episode of ""The Second Half"" podcast, Huffington Post sports reporter Travis Waldron and NFL veteran Donté Stallworth break down some of the interesting storylines of the NBA's Christmas Day schedule:Here's the full schedule for Friday (Eastern times):12 p.m. – Pelicans vs. Heat, ESPN2:30 p.m. – Bulls vs. Thunder, ABC5 p.m. – Cavaliers vs. Warriors, ABC8 p.m. – Spurs vs. Rockets, ESPN10:30 p.m. – Clippers vs. Lakers, ESPNAlso on this week's podcast, Travis and Donté discuss the possibility of the NFL relocating a franchise -- or two -- to Los Angeles, Gibert Arenas' terrible criticism of the WNBA, and a Missouri legislator's idea to take scholarships from college athletes who protest campus issues in the wake of the University of Missouri football team's walk-out earlier this year.This podcast was produced, edited and engineered by Peter James Callahan and Adriana Usero, with assistance from Christine Conetta.Also on HuffPost:"
26,SPORTS,NFL Players And Team Owners Can See 'Concussion' For Free,Mollie Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nfl-concussion-free-admission_us_567b2a11e4b014efe0d80e9a,"""This is a movie for the players.""",2015-12-24,"Will Smith is the star of ""Concussion,"" which opens Christmas Day.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/567b2a4b160000b300eb98d2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sony Pictures is offering NFL players and team owners free admission to the studio's new film, ""Concussion,"" which tells the story of the doctor who uncovered the link between football injuries and brain damage. The film, which opens Christmas Day, stars Will Smith as Dr. Bennet Omalu, the forensic pathologist who discovered chronic traumatic encephalopathy during an autopsy of Pittsburgh Steelers legend Mike Webster. The degenerative disease appears in athletes with a history of repeated brain trauma -- including concussions that pro football players endure regularly in games. The film depicts Omalu's discovery of the disease and his efforts to alert the public, the media and the NFL to the problem.NFL players can receive free admission to the film at any Cinemark theater by presenting their players' association card, the studio said in a press release. The studio sponsored free advance screenings for players in the city of each NFL team. ""This is a movie for the players, so we wanted to give them a chance to see it before its nationwide release and free admission during its run in theaters,"" producers Ridley Scott and Giannina Scott said in the release. ""We think the players will enjoy watching this movie about Dr. Omalu's incredible courage – courage that changed the game.""The NFL has been criticized for years of inaction on the concussion crisis. In 2013, the league settled a lawsuit filed by thousands of retired players seeking damages, medical tests and funding for research. A settlement that may cost as much as $1 billion was approved by a federal judge earlier this year, but some terms remain in dispute.""We’re not focused on a movie, we’re focused on continuing to make progress,"" NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell told reporters earlier this month, according to Sports Illustrated. ""We have incredible progress that has been made, not only in rule changes, but also in what we saw today with materials and protection that will prevent these injuries from happening."" Omalu, meanwhile, has warned that athletes should be as concerned about the smaller blows to the head that NFL players endure throughout the careers as they are about concussions.""It is not about concussions,” Omalu told The Huffington Post. “We now know that all types of repeated blows to the head, no matter how seemingly innocuous, have the potential to cause brain injury.”Earlier: Are We Focusing Too Much Attention On Football Concussions?Also on HuffPost:"
