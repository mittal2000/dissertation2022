0,CRIME,Cain and Abel and the Boston Brothers,"Claudia Ricci, Contributor
Freelance journalist and fiction writer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/cain-and-abel-and-the-bos_us_5ba2c67fe4b0c2784da61e8e,"Rather than hating the bomber, it seems better to me that we should love the lesson about choice that he so painfully teaches.",2013-04-21,"WATERTOWN, MA - APRIL 19: A SWAT team files down Nicholas Avenue during an ongoing manhunt for a suspect in the terrorist bombing of the 117th Boston Marathon earlier this week. Watertown is on lockdown following a chase and shootout in the area last night. (Photo by David L. Ryan/The Boston Globe via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5ba2c67f2100003000c65c62.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As I contemplated the events of the week this morning, I found my mind going to strange places.First of all I kept seeing the face of the younger brother lying in some hospital bed in Boston. He has the face of an ""angel,"" according to so many accounts by former friends and acquaintances, school chums and some of his family members. Or it's the face of a thoroughly demonic fiend, a ruthless criminal, according to authorities and so many news reports and quotes from the deeply traumatized people of Boston.And yet, on this Sunday morning, I realize that I am not thinking of this young man with hatred. I keep going to that hospital bed and seeing what amounts to a lost soul, a person, yes, who committed one of the worst atrocities our nation has known, but at the same time, a person who may have been unduly influenced by an even bigger lost soul, his older brother. Perhaps I am finding myself in this ambiguous place because those first grainy video photos of him shocked me -- for a couple of moments the young man vaguely reminded me of my own 23-year-old son. Both young men are dark, handsome, tall and slender and they have been known to wear their baseball caps turned backward on their heads. That connection to my son evaporated quickly and like so many millions of others this week, I found myself hating the younger brother to his core. I wanted more than anything in the world -- and perhaps more than for any crime I've ever heard about -- that he would be caught quickly and brought to the full weight of justice for what he allegedly did at the marathon's finish line. My own daughter and son-in-law were in lockdown all day Friday in their new home on Beacon Street, days after witnessing the runners go past their front door.But this morning I am finding it harder to hate Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. My mind oddly enough crawls toward the Torah, the Hebrew Bible, and thanks in part to John Steinbeck -- and his novel, East of Eden -- to the story of Cain and Abel. East of Eden, the title, is taken directly from the Bible. Indeed at one point Steinbeck suggested to his publisher that the book should be entitled Cain Sign. Steinbeck wrote an accompanying book to East of Eden, called Journal of a Novel: East of Eden, which documents his thoughts while he wrote the novel. Steinbeck's editor and long-time friend, Pat Covici, told Steinbeck that he wanted him to deliver the manuscript in a box, so Steinbeck went to great lengths to construct a mahogany box. On top of the box he engraved four Hebrew letters, which spell out the Hebrew word, ""timshol,"" literally translated as ""thou mayest,"" suggesting Steinbeck's core belief that human beings, endowed with free will after the fall from the Garden of Eden, are continually faced with moral responsibility in the form of choice between good and evil. Indeed, as Terry R. Wright notes in his 2007 book Genesis of Fiction, the notion of choice ""might be the most important word in the world. That says the way is open. That throws it right back on a [wo]man. For if 'Thou mayest' -- it is also true that 'Thou Mayest Not.'"" What has all this got to do with the Boston bomber? Everything. Unequivocally, the bombers chose to do a wickedly evil thing. But that leaves us asking how we should choose to respond (aside of course from the full weight of criminal prosecution). We leave it to police authorities and the courts to mete out Tsarnaev's punishment, but how do we talk about him, how do we feel, what should we think and say? I was drawn today to open the Torah, to reread Genesis, Chapter Four, Verse Ten, the passage that lays out God's punishment of Cain for slaying his brother Abel. ""Then He [God] said, 'What have you done? Hark, your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground. Therefore, you shall be more cursed than the ground which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand."" God curses Cain to ""become a ceaseless wanderer on earth.""Cain replies: ""My punishment is too great to bear! Since You have banished me this day from the soil, and I must avoid Your presence and become a restless wanderer on earth -- anyone who meets me may kill me!""It is the Lord's reply to Cain that perhaps is most instructive: ""The Lord said to him 'I promise, if anyone kills Cain, sevenfold vengeance shall be taken on him.' And the Lord put a mark on Cain, lest anyone who met him should kill him. Cain left the presence of the Lord and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.""It is this notion that the world's first murderer, Cain, is marked by God, and in being marked, he is forever a lesson to us in the ultimate choice between good and evil. As one commentary notes, ""his mark is not a curse, but a protective sign of God's enduring care.""Amidst our rightful desire to punish him, and our intense curiosity (and confusion) about how this one-time ""good"" boy went so bad, maybe we should refrain from ""killing"" the bomber with each one of our thoughts and conversations. Rather, the Bible's instruction would seem to suggest that the bombing suspect should remind us once again of what Steinbeck wrote in East of Eden, that ""We have only one story. All novels, all poetry, are built on the never-ending contest in ourselves of good and evil. And it occurs to me that evil must constantly re-spawn, while good, while virtue is venerable as nothing else in the world is.""Instead of hating the bomber, better that we focus our ""lovingkindness"" (a Buddhist concept of loving all living beings) on the many suffering families, the myriad heroes who came to the aid of bombing victims on the scene, and the amazing authorities who waged an extraordinary four-day search to catch the bombers before they could wreak any more destruction. Rather than hating the bomber, it seems better to me that we should love the lesson about choice that he so painfully teaches."

People who endorse free-market economics -- an economic theory that argues the markets regulate themselves and work better without too much government intervention -- are more likely to deny climate change, according to a study published last month in Psychological Science. Based on a survey of climate blog visitors, the researchers also found that those who endorse free-market economics are more likely to reject other widely accepted scientific theories. About 97 percent of climate researchers believe climate change is real, according to a 2010 study from the University of Illinois. “Endorsement of free-market economics predicted rejection of climate science,” the researchers wrote. “Endorsement of free markets also predicted the rejection of other established scientific findings, such as the facts that HIV causes AIDS and that smoking causes lung cancer.”Some prominent free-market backers have been known to deny climate change in what critics argue is an aim to stop the government from placing stricter environmental regulations on businesses. The billionaire Koch Brothers have funded groups that push free market ideology as well as groups that deny claims that global warming is taking place and that it’s caused in large part by humans. Still Ronald Reagan, one of the most famous supporters of free-market economics, made moves to curb humans’ detrimental effect on the environment during his second term as president, according to a November New York Times op-ed by Cass Sunstein, a former Obama Administration official. Reagan became the prime leader in an international push to phase out ozone-depleting chemicals, despite his skepticism of environmental regulations, according to the NYT piece. That’s because Reagan’s economists discovered that stopping manmade harm to the ozone -- a phenomenon that is different, but not entirely unrelated to climate change -- would cost a lot less over the long term than letting it go on.

The oldest brother was known as a real control freak. He wanted to know everything about everyone. He knew what was best for his family and he certainly didn't trust them to make their own choices. Let's call him Big Brother.The middle brother believed that everyone should do as they please, but not because he knew what was best, but because he felt family members should pull their own weight. He didn't want anyone freeloading off of his hard work and sweat equity -- especially not Big Brother. Let's call him Little Brother.The youngest brother just wanted to have fun. He was not a very ambitious fellow. The youngest brother would get caught up in the schemes of Big Brother and Little Brother where he was courted as often as he was bullied. The youngest brother lived in relative poverty and didn't have the tools or dollars that his older brothers enjoyed and with which he could defend himself. Let's call this unfortunate soul Social Brother.One day Social Brother found a genie in a pocket-sized magic lamp that had been created when Little Brother appropriated Big Brother's secrets and transformed them into a product to sell to Social Brother. (This was one of the reasons Big and Little Brother were always fighting -- Little Brother seldom thought of consequences and Big Brother thought of nothing but consequences.) Now that Social Brother had a magic lamp, it made him nearly as powerful and Big and Little Brother combined. But Social Brother didn't know the traditions that kept genies from upsetting the balance of power nor did Social Brother have an agenda other than perhaps getting some Lulz or getting lucky.This week, starting with the tragic and sensless bombing of the Boston Marathon on Monday, through a riveting manhunt for two fugitive brothers, and ending in the death of one and apprehension of the other, Social Brother showed us just how powerful his genie (Internet+mobile+social+photography) has become.Reddit Wanted to HelpIt was exciting to see the adhocracy of Reddit self-organize and try to identify those responsible for the bombs. It was a page right out of Gertrude Chandler Warner's Boxcar Children novels. Four orphans flee a society that neither cares for nor wants them and setup an independent life in an abandoned boxcar where they proceed to solve crimes as young sleuths who can out-think the bad guys far better than the adults on the job. (Except that the Boxcar Children had a rich grandfather and didn't really need to run away from society in first place.)Members of the Reddit (Social Brother) had the best intentions and showed tremendous selfcontrol during their quest to help the authorities (Big Brother). They poured through pictures, discussed theories, and scoured social network profiles and newsfeeds. It was, in point of fact, an awesome job. But a name was leaked and a missing kid was miss identified as a suspect on the run. Once that genie gets out of the lamp there is no putting him back.I sincerely hope there will not be a next time but of course, there will. What can Social Brother do the next time he wants to help? Well, Social Brother isn't a person or an institution or even a group of people. Social Brother is anyone and everyone with an Internet connection and a computer or smartphone. Instead of castigating Reddit, 4Chan, or any of the other loose collections of individuals that make up Social Brother we just have to learn to follow our own advice: Just because someone says something, even if he or she believes it to be true, doesn't mean it's true. The best journalist know that information has to be verified by multiple sources and the sources themselves have to be varied. We all have to be better journalists because Social Brother isn't a journalist. Social Brother is us.Twitter Mucks It UpIt fun to ""live tweet"" an event that is happening in front of you, like a concert or a protest or a crime scene. You're letting the world know what is going on and shining a light on events that are important to the twitterverse (thereby rubbing some of that importance on to you). It's also fun to listen to a police scanner and get caught up in the world of first responders and police actions as they rescue victims and engage bad guys.The Boston Police Department found the mixture of twitter and police scanners particularly noxious this week and had to ask Social Brother to stop tweeting -- ironically through tweets of their own.Just as Social Brother can be the ""good guys"" he can also be the ""bad guys."" Nothing is stopping fleeing suspects from using Twitter to follow the progress of an investigation or even tweet misinformation of their own. There is a great scene in the original Matrix movie where Morpheus (Little Brother) uses a mobile phone to guide Neo away from pursuing agents (Big Brothers) in an office building. Somehow, in the illogical logic of the movie, the agents were not able to observe Neo as easily as Morpheus even though the agents seemed to be the system admins of that virtual world. In real life logic, there is no privileged point of view and we all have access to Twitter. This is another case where we're just going to have to learn how to restrain ourselves and use good judgement before we tweet. It's OK to be Social Brother when murderers are not involved. Perhaps in the future we'll judge the social mojo of a person not by how many followers they have but by how responsible they are when tweeting.Facebook HelpsHere's some good news: A case where Social Brother did his job and did it well. The Whalley Brothers spotted a photograph of their injured father at the scene of the bombing. But they could not communicate with him. They called the authorities (Big Brother) but because of a spelling error the authorities were unable to help. The Whalley Brothers didn't know what happened to their mother and father and turned to Facebook (and Social Brother) to find out. The exciting thing is that it didn't take long for Social Brother to get back the the Whally Brothers with their parent's location and condition. The Facebook community can be compassionate as it can be cruel. We hear mostly about the dark side of Social Brother on Facebook, the kids bullied and teased, the con artists, the hours lost to consuming social drivel. But there is a very bright side where Social Brother raises consciousness, reunites pets with their loved ones, and raises money for noble causes.Social Brother is Here to StaySocial Brother, like Big and Little Brother is not good or bad. He just is. He can't be fixed because he isn't broken. But he can be accepted and understood. Don't except Social Brother to come to your rescue. We can't order him around like a personal army. We can't predict what Social Brother is going to take an interest in or make him like or +1 our blog posts and products. And anyone who claims to have the key to Social Brother's innerworkings is trolling us.In a week where the courage and resolve of Bostonians was severely tested, where all Americans (Big, Little, and Social Brothers alike) rallied in support of justice and worked together towards a common goal, and where Anonymous raised $50,000 dollars to start their own version of The Huffington Post, we witnessed how the intersection of the Internet, mobile computing, social networks, and digital photography creates the news as much as it witnesses the news.I hope Big, Little, and Social Brother continue to learn to get along."
4,ENTERTAINMENT,Dressing Up: The 10 Best Period Costume Movies,"John Farr, Contributor

Spain, 1965 (Photo by Mondadori Portfolio via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb42333240000500055ff10.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the singular joys of living in New York City is The Metropolitan Museum of Art, conveniently situated right across the Park from us. I was reminded of this on Wednesday when I attended their ""Impressionism, Fashion, and Modernity"" exhibition. Combining artwork and costumes, it showed how the finest French impressionist painters of the late-19th century were celebrating Paris as the epicenter of style and fashion in their work, by painting not just glorious gardens and vistas, but the colorful, elaborate outfits worn by the city's most prominent women.Admittedly, I'm a sucker for the Impressionists. Were I Bill Gates, I'd be snapping up any Monet or Renoir I could lay my hands on. And though you won't see me at any ""Fashion Week"" events, I also love and revere timeless fashion and style, by which I mean: a) Clean styles, cuts and color sense that worked in 1930, and will work in 2030.b) Fashions from the past -- say, two centuries (I'm less interested in togas) -- when what you wore and how you wore it was so much more important. (My Met visit reinforced this last truth as I beheld rapt attendees gazing up at gorgeous gowns and suits in their t-shirts and blue jeans. It was something out of a New Yorker cartoon.)As I was being blissfully engulfed by all this sensory stimuli, the idea for this piece came to me. I started thinking about the key role costume design plays in making a classic period film work. By definition, these movies must simulate time-travel, and accurate, lovingly detailed period attire help achieve the effect, while filling us with wonder at the often spectacular way our forebears and ancestors once dressed.My top 10 picks stand as great films on their own, but in each case, the stunning costume work really adds to the impact. And though many will reasonably cite examples of classic black and white movies that also deliver the goods, it's no coincidence that all of the following titles were shot in vibrant color.(Final trivia note: the Oscar for best costume design was only introduced in the late forties. Of the nine films I've listed which were released since then, seven won the Oscar, and the other two were nominated.)Gone With The Wind (1939): At the outbreak of the Civil War, feisty, narcissistic Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) meets her match in roguish charmer Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), who woos her persistently despite her love for another man, Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard). Ashley however has chosen the gentle Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland) for his bride. All this sets the stage for one of cinema's most turbulent romances, with plenty of historic, cathartic moments in the background, as the progress and aftermath of the war leaves the Old South in ashes. One of the world's most cherished and enduring pictures, Wind was birthed in the mind of novelist Margaret Mitchell and incubated by brilliant, obsessive producer David O. Selznick, who spared no expense in bringing this powerful, affecting story to the big screen. The ultra-lavish production features ornate costumes and art design, jaw-dropping set pieces and historical sequences (especially the burning of Atlanta, for which a Hollywood set was torched), all wrapped around the story of a resourceful, if not likable, heroine. Leigh (a native Brit!) plays the self-absorbed Scarlett to perfection, while Gable's Rhett is devilishly attractive and fiercely masculine. Grand studio filmmaking at its aristocratic best, Selznick's brainchild nabbed an armload of Oscars, including Best Picture and Actress (for Leigh).Moulin Rouge (1952): Frustrated by a childhood injury that's deformed his legs, well-heeled, fin-de-siecle painter Toulouse-Lautrec (Jose Ferrer) immerses himself in the bawdy world of Montmartre's lively show club the Moulin Rouge, quaffing cognac and observing can-can acts while he works at his art. One night on his way home, he meets Marie (Colette Marchand), a prostitute trying to ditch a vice cop, and the two begin a tumultuous relationship. A box-office smash in 1952, John Huston's engrossing biopic about the discordant life and loves of famed 19th-century painter Toulouse-Lautrec is drenched in colors taken from the artist's own palette. Shot mostly from the waist up, but acting on his knees, José Ferrer does a remarkable job of conveying the gloomy Toulouse-Lautrec, whose infirmity crippled his self-esteem but instigated his flagrant art. Zsa Zsa Gabor is also captivating as entertainer Jane Avril, while composer Georges Auric's now-classic score gives Rouge a melancholy cast. The flamboyant opening sequence is one of Huston's finest set pieces. Gigi (1958): Gigi (Caron) is a young Parisian schoolgirl at that awkward stage between girlishness and womanhood. Older, wealthy family friend Gaston (Jourdan) has always treated her like a little sister. Eventually though, Gigi blossoms into quite a beauty, which causes Gaston considerable inner conflict. Complicating matters is that Gigi comes from a family of courtesans- not the type a gentleman would customarily marry into. To help him resolve what to do, Gaston enlists the help of good-hearted Uncle Honore (Chevalier), who's wise in the ways of women and romance. Top MGM producer Arthur Freed and director Vincente Minnelli hit their respective peaks with this enchanting movie, one of the few musicals ever to win the Best Picture Oscar. Caron is radiant as the gamine who becomes a beautiful woman before our very eyes, the suave Jourdan is just right for Gaston (he can sing too!), and Chevalier steals every scene he's in as old roué Honore. Even so the film's real stars remain that gossamer Lerner-Lowe score, and Minnelli's sumptuous recreation of fin-de-siecle Paris. Thank Heaven indeed!The Leopard (1963): This gorgeous, sweeping historical film, based on a top-selling Italian novel, portrays a transitional period in 19th century Sicily, when the old aristocracy gave way to the rising middle classes to forge a more democratic nation. This societal change is glimpsed through the eyes of the aging prince Don Fabrizio Salina, (Burt Lancaster), decidedly of the old Italy, who views its passing philosophically. Salina's handsome nephew Tancredi (Alain Delon) and his intended, Angelica (Claudia Cardinale), represent the incoming order. Director Luchino Visconti's exquisite epic weaves the theme of societal upheaval into a sumptuous and stunning cinematic tapestry. A meticulously dubbed Lancaster gives a flavorful, commanding performance as the proud patriarch, while Delon and Cardinale comprise one of the most magnetic young couples ever captured on celluloid. The film's final set piece is a particular stunner, often cited as one of the most visually arresting sequences in all film. (Trivia note: both Brando and Laurence Olivier were considered for Lancaster's role here, just as all three actors would compete for the part of Don Corleone in The Godfather nearly ten years later.)Dr. Zhivago (1965): Though married to Tonya Gromeko (Geraldine Chaplin), daughter of the couple who adopted him as a youth, poet-physician Yuri Zhivago (Omar Sharif) nurses an undying passion for Lara (Julie Christie), the lovely wife of a political rebel he meets during the First War. With the violent upheavals of the Bolshevik Revolution wreaking havoc in their lives and throughout Russia, will their passionate love survive? Based on Boris Pasternak's Nobel Prize-winning novel, David Lean's third masterpiece (following The Bridge on the River Kwai and Lawrence of Arabia) is a sumptuous, absorbing epic in the grand tradition of filmmaking. Sharif and Christie (often glimpsed in adoring close-ups) are ravishing to watch, as Lean turns an earth-shattering moment in world history into high romantic drama. Brimming with unforgettable images of the Russian steppes captured by Oscar-winning lensman Freddie Young, Lean's snowy, romantic spectacle is just what the Doctor ordered, with marvelous ensemble work by Rod Steiger, Alec Guinness, Tom Courtenay, and Klaus Kinski.Barry Lyndon (1976): Fleeing Ireland after a duel, roguish young Redmond Barry (Ryan O'Neal) pursues an odd and adventurous course into high society, including a stint in the Prussian army under the command of Captain Potzdorf (Hardy Kruger). Eventually, after romping through Europe with a card sharp, he meets gorgeous, newly widowed Lady Lyndon (Marisa Berenson). But this twist of romantic fortune may not end well for Barry. A chilly social critique guised as an elaborate costume drama, Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon is a splendidly realized, visually sumptuous affair. At the height of his fame in the mid '70s, O'Neal portrays Barry with sly charm as he becomes embroiled in war, betrayal, romance, and family dysfunction. Neglected in its day, this stately adaptation of William Thackeray's novel deserves its rehabilitated reputation: John Alcott's low-light cinematography is exquisite, the period details are obsessively spot-on, and the entire picture-winner of several Oscars-has the look of a color-saturated 18th-century canvas. Fanny and Alexander (1982): Set in early 20th century Sweden, this sumptuous film concerns the Ekdahls, an exuberant clan whose happy life is seen through the eyes of young son Alexander (Bertil Guve). But when patriarch Oskar dies, mother Emilie (Ewa Frolling) rashly decides to remarry cold Bishop Vergerus (Jan Malmsjo), and the Ekdahls' existence is transformed from one of warm colors to a stern, inflexible gray. Perhaps the crowning work of Ingmar Bergman's long, distinguished career was originally a TV mini-series, cut to three hours for theatrical release. Certainly the Swedish master's most autobiographical film, Fanny shows how a sudden turn in one family's fortunes accelerates the maturing of son Alexander, who's modeled on Bergman's youthful self. Magical and ultimately optimistic, the multiple Oscar-winning Fanny is a masterpiece of storytelling on film, by turns intimate and epic.A Room With a View (1985): Traveling in Italy with protective spinster cousin Charlotte (Maggie Smith) at the dawn of the 20th century, beautiful English maiden Lucy Honeychurch (Helena Bonham-Carter) meets and falls for the dashing, free-spirited George Emerson (Julian Sands). Witnessing their stolen kiss high above Florence, disapproving Charlotte goads her to return to England, where Lucy is eventually courted by the stiff, conventional Cecil Vyse (Daniel Day-Lewis). Yet her passions are aroused again when Emerson moves nearby. One of the finest creations coming out of the longstanding Merchant/Ivory alliance, Room With a View is a stunningly evocative romance lovingly adapted by screenwriter Ruth Prawer Jhabvala from the book by E.M. Forster. Nominated for eight Academy Awards, the film boasts dazzling sets and costumes, along with note-perfect early turns by Merchant-Ivory regular Bonham-Carter and an uncharacteristically priggish Day-Lewis. Don't miss this lush, smart and sumptuous cinematic treat.Topsy-Turvy (1999): An in-depth look at the life and work of 19th century British musical team Gilbert and Sullivan. This film goes beyond faithful renderings of their timeless operettas to expose the backstage shenanigans of their company and the strained relations between straitlaced librettist Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and dissolute composer Sullivan (Allan Corduner). Just when it seems the two have reached the end of their creative tether, they're inspired to create their most enduring work, The Mikado. Director Mike Leigh meticulously recreates the London that belonged to Gilbert and Sullivan. The film's mix of pageant and backstage drama accelerates the long-running time, and you find yourself lost in the look and textures of that time and place. Musical renditions, sets, and costumes feel stunningly authentic, reinforcing why the pair was the toast of England. Both Broadbent and Corduner excel in the leads, each in their way conveying the frustrating predicament of an incompatible partnership. La Vie En Rose (2007): Born into a bordello and abandoned as a youth, French singing icon Edith Piaf (Marion Cotillard) learned from an early age that the world was full of sorrow. Tracing her incredibly fateful life and career from destitution on the streets of Paris to her eventual fame as the eminent chanteuse of her generation, this biopic depicts how Piaf--troubled by drugs, violence, and cruel twists of fate -- channeled the anguish of her experience into sublime songcraft. You couldn't ask for a better life story than Piaf's, and French director Dahan spares nothing in his depiction of the legendary singer, who was discovered crooning for pennies on a corner by cabaret owner Louis Leplee (Gerard Depardieu), later loved champion boxer Marcel Cerdan (Jean-Pierre Martins), and ultimately found a berth in 1950s Hollywood. But despite these successes, she endured enough tragedy to make Sophocles weep, and it's the supernaturally beautiful Cotillard who brings Piaf to radiant, charismatic life in this unusually enthralling biopic, for which she won a much-deserved Oscar. Yes, this Rose has its thorns, but the pain is pure bliss.Looking for good movies to watch? Top movie recommendations?

Marathon Day signals the ""real"" start of spring for New Englanders. It reminds Americans of our steely roots because it always falls on Patriots Day. It launches spring school vacation week in Massachusetts. And, it stirs my former professional connections to the event, having covered it for Boston's CBS News affiliate (now NBC) and managed marketing client, the Boston Athletic Association's 100th Anniversary activities.  So the holiday opened for me, my eight year old son, husband and dog with the lazy feel of a Sunday morning. I lingered over coffee knowing there was no morning scramble to shower and catch the school bus. We'd decided to make it a TV-free day. We played the board game Life, I did a West Coast conference call and my husband puttered outside. In the early afternoon, with my son playing at my feet, I checked Facebook and learned about the bombings. Abandoning the family vow, I flipped on the TV, aghast at the barbarism at the ""Hub's"" beloved Boston Marathon.In just a few minutes, my ""Mom"" instincts overtook my journalist and news junkie instincts and I turned off the TV, knowing the cumulative effects of media. But in that short time, the fear and gruesome implications were already in sharp reveal. So, I decided to talk to my son about what had happened at the Marathon. In today's wired world, there's no shielding children completely from such harsh realities. Who could have guessed that I'd need to find words to comfort my son like after the Newtown, CT massacre -- twice in just six months? As a former PBS-er, I went to my most trusted parenting source, PBS KIDS. It offered Mr. Rogers' sage advice, in times of tragedy, ""look for the helpers, you will always find people who are helping."" I conveyed those thoughts to my son, while noting Rogers' additional advice to the media to be sure to cover the ""helpers."" I didn't know what my son felt or heard, but was glad to have Fred Rogers' ""helpful"" words. Then, we all went outside to get distance from the horror unfolding on the television. We planted bulbs, played catch with our dog, Curtis and took the bikes for a spin. At bedtime, when I did a recheck with my son about the days' events, he delivered a non-verbal signal of understanding and comfort, hugging Curtis, who was curled up at the end of the bed. This vacation week I decided to send my son to our town's vacation community program in hopes that playtime with other kids would help him both separate from and process the atrocity he had ""witnessed."" Yesterday was a bit better for everyone -- a day of healing with the President in Boston comforting victims, the city and the nation; suspects identified; and social media afire with sentiments of ""Boston Strong."" At the town's vacation program, there were special visitors for the children, ""Barn Babies,"" coincidentally scheduled for that day. My son played with piglets, kids (goats), chicks, puppies and kittens. After that, he was the most relaxed I'd seen him since the atrocity happened. The animal babies had done their magic.This morning, unaware of the firefight and carjacking, we expected more healing and calm. The call that went to voice mail at the crack of dawn from Emerson College (where I'm an adjunct professor) cancelling classes because the city was in lockdown, should have been a tip off. During breakfast, I turned on the TV to check on the weather and learned about the unimaginable developments with the two Marathon bomber suspects.My son was visually shaken so I turned off the TV immediately. Only with a lot of coaxing did I learn of my son's particular worry. (He's not too chatty about his anxieties or concerns.) He explained that he was afraid that the ""bad man"" was going to come to our house. I quickly responded, ""Oh no, the last place a bad guy on the run could hideout is a house with a cute white pup that barks when someone comes to the house."" A huge smile of relief came across my son's face. Curtis closed the love loop by licking my son's hand. This sometimes-annoying canine practice of announcing visitors with loud barks had become my saving grace. In that moment of my son's smile, Curtis had become my helper and my hero. As a concerned parent, I've learned two things so far from the Boston Marathon tragedy. First, make sure you work hard to understand you kids' specific fears so you can address them directly to make them feel safer. And second, look everywhere for the ""helpers"" because they may come in many forms. From the Marathon runners donating blood right after the race and BAA personnel, volunteers and bystanders rushing toward the smoke to first responders' swift and steady actions and medical staff working tirelessly through several nights.And in our family's case, the ""helper"" took the shape of a medium-sized lab mix, Curtis, who celebrates his fourth anniversary of adoption from the Northeast Animal Shelter in Salem, MA -- tomorrow. The still unanswered question for me is who was more comforted by our dog Curtis during this uncertain time, my son or me?Has an animal helped or comforted you in a time of need?

I was a Gunnery Sergeant, with almost 15 years of service. I had been a Marine since I was 17, and had planned on doing 30 years. But now all of that was over.A cancer syndrome I have, called von Hippel Lindau (VHL), had progressed, resulting in four brain tumors and kidney cancer on both kidneys. That, when combined with the loss of my left eye due to the disease a few years earlier, added up to my career being over.I was down, depressed, and confused. But, mainly I was scared. Being a Marine was all I'd wanted to do since I was a 10-year-old kid. What would I do now? And would the disease I have get even worse?I guess I could have just gone home and taken it easy, as was recommended to me by most medical experts. They'd told me that my best years were far behind me; that I'd never be able to do the kind of things I once had.But I chose to not listen to all of that. Instead, I rebuilt myself ‒- mentally, physically, and spiritually. I went on to become a world-class adventure athlete and have done things that even surprise me. And in the process, I have learned a lot about overcoming fear. Which brings me to Alcatraz prison.Alcatraz is probably the most infamous of all prisons. There is an aura about it, the way it ominously sits out in the San Francisco Bay, surrounded by treacherous, ice-cold water, brimming with sea creatures. It's no wonder that supposedly no one ever escaped during its many years of existence as a federal prison.But, I wanted to prove that it could be done. That if someone made it to the water, and knew what they were doing, they could, in fact, swim off the island to San Francisco. I would not only just swim it though; I'd do it with my hands and feet bound.I taught water survival in the Marine Corps, and one of the things we'd do to show what is possible in survival scenarios is swim with our hands and feet tied, so I knew I could swim that way. Still, doing it in an open ocean environment, with who knows what looking up at me, had me scared.Even though it ended up being one of the hardest things I've ever done, I was able to make it and am now one of only three people to have done the swim in such a way. And, while you may never do such a thing yourself, I know you have to deal with fear as well. The following tips help me face it; I hope they'll help you too.Stop irrational thoughts. When in a fearful situation, the creative part of the brain takes over and begins to conjure up all sorts of dire thoughts. It's hard to think rationally in that state of mind, so it's vital you switch back to the logical side. To do so, try this: recite your ABCs backward, or count as high as you can by threes, or name all of the seven dwarves. All of these methods force you back to the logical side of the brain, allowing you to think rationally.Evaluate the fear.  Is what you're feeling real, or is it something you've simply made up? Some fears are legitimate and we need to be aware of them (like the fear of jumping into a fire) and respect them. However, it's usually the ones that aren't real, the ones that we simply make up, that hold us back the most in life. That's why it's important to know the difference.Act accordingly. Once you've made your evaluation, act on the fear accordingly. There is a lot of power in the acting. Something verging on the supernatural happens. In fact, a famous saying says that by doing the thing you fear, the death of fear is certain. I have found that to be totally accurate.Build your courage muscle.  Just because you face a fear once doesn't mean that it goes away forever. The more you do so, however, the easier it is to deal with. A great goal to have is to do something to build your ""courage muscle"" each day. It doesn't have to be something physical, or dramatic, just something that takes you out of your comfort zone.This post is part of a series produced by The Huffington Post as part of our continuing commitment to recognize fearlessness.

Olofson's 13-year-old daughter had heard an explosion and her mother thought it would be safest for the family to move to the basement while police widened their search for the suspects thought to be responsible for Monday's Boston Marathon bombing.Olofson, 50, said she was asleep when her younger daughter woke her up after hearing an explosion.""We immediately assumed it was related to the bombing,"" she said. ""We all went into the basement because we didn't know what was going on and it sounded really close. We came back up after 10 minutes and heard another explosion. It was clear that something was unfolding close by.""More from Everyday Health: Statins and Diabetes Link: A Clearer Picture Emerges Ginkgo Biloba Linked to Cancer Scientists Reverse Memory Loss in Sea Snail Brain CellOlofson said she heard helicopters throughout the night -- most likely related to police efforts to capture two bombing suspects about a mile from the Olofson's home.""We were scared, but once I realized it was a little ways away, we just sort of took it in stride,"" she said. ""You feel safe being in the house. I don't think we panicked.""Police have killed one of two bombing suspects, according to numerous reports, and continue to search for the other, believed to be Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, a Chechnyan national living legally in the United States. But experts say that for those like the Olofson's, the ordeal is likely to continue to resonate and -- potentially -- pose emotional health concerns.""It's one thing when something happens across the country, but when it has a personal connection, it looks much different,"" said Jeffrey Magill, project coordinator for behavioral health emergency management at Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. ""We empathize with other places, but when the people have names and faces and are from our community it's much different.""""All of a sudden, we realize we could be next,"" he added.For some, the images and sounds of the Marathon bombing, which killed three and left 170 injured, can cause problems typically seen in soldiers returning from war, according to Rachel Yehuda, PhD, director of the traumatic stress studies division at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.""Post-traumatic stress disorder may occur in those who were directly affected by the event,"" she said in an email. ""The injuries appear similar to what soldiers experience on the battlefield—head trauma, physical damage such as loss of limbs or shrapnel wounds, combined with the emotional trauma, the unexpected nature of the event, and the knowledge that someone has had an intent to harm, can be a devastating combination.""Olofson said that while she was scared by last night's helicopters and explosions, she and others in the Boston area have been waiting for something like this to happen ever since the Marathon.""You never expect this to happen so close,"" she said, ""but since Monday, people have been prepared for something like this and ready to go into some kind of protection mode.""That protection mode, said Diane Poole Heller, Ph.D., a trauma resolution expert, is a normal response to trauma, but can cause serious health problems. Once we begin to feel that our lives are in danger, it can cause us to see danger everywhere, which has not only psychological effects, but physiological effects as well.“When people perceive that they're in a life threating situation, it's normal for them to go into a shutdown mode,” she said. ""Over a long period of time, it can affect their digestion, they can become hyper-vigilant and lose sleep. It can lead to panic, anxiety and perceiving threat everywhere.""Being on lockdown in their own community, Magill said, will only serve to exacerbate those problems. “If a lockdown in a community goes on for hours, that fear and anxiety that comes from not knowing what is going on has a greater impact,” he said. “It can exacerbate previous trauma.""But even once the lockdown is lifted, people begin resuming their daily activities,and the trauma begins to subside, it's important to remain on the lookout for signs of depression, anger and flashbacks up to a year later, Heller said.“Whenever something really traumatic happens, there's a very strong incidence of anniversary trauma,” she said. “On the year anniversary of the event, the trauma surfaces again, and if people don't plan to take care of themselves around that time, it's almost like it's happening again.”How To Cope With A Disaster When a disaster affects you so personally, Heller said, it is imperative to lean on other people in the community in order to foster a sense of safety. Talking to a friend or family member can help you work through any issues that arise once the ordeal is over.“One of things that is really important is having a strong support system,” she said. “Isolation is a fallout of trauma that's very damaging. It's hard to deal with a tragedy if you are by yourself.”Olofson said that while the streets in Belmont are eerily quiet, she cannot wait for people to start leaving their homes so they can talk about it in person, rather than over the phone.“I think human contact and talking about it, reassuring yourself and each other will help a lot,” she said.And while having a support network can help you overcome feelings of grief, shock, or horror during times like this, Heller added, if you begin to experience flashbacks or have angry outbursts, you should seek professional help.For children, it's important to sit down and explain to them what is going on, Magill said, as they are not able to express themselves as well as adults.“Adults have life experience and coping mechanisms, but kids may not have the same level of ability to communicate their fears or concerns, so they often do so through their actions,” he said. “You may see some acting out, some regression in behavior or destructive behaviors.”Allowing them to express themselves is important, he added, but if the behavior begins to interfere with their lives or schoolwork, you may want to consider bringing in a professional.In the end, Dr. Yehuda said it's important to be prepared for emergencies, because as this week's events show, they can happen in the blink of an eye.“Knowing emergency plans – for example, where to meet up with family and loved ones, or knowing with whom to stay following a catastrophic event – can help minimize some of the stress brought on in times of disaster,” she said. “In addition to preparing for trauma, people can alleviate their own feelings of anxiety or helplessness by volunteering in some way, particularly if they are in the Boston area.”But for Olofson, who said she's relieved that the whole thing is over now, she's just hoping that they never hear those sounds again.“The ordeal was unnerving, but it's no longer scary,” she said. “We're just hoping no one else gets hurt.”""Psychological Impact Of Boston Terror Likely To Continue For Residents"" originally appeared on Everyday Health"

There is this diet and that diet and one philosophy after another about what to eat and when to eat it and how far apart to space meals and good fats and bad fats -- and the list goes on. We can Google almost anything today and find an answer for what to eat for better eyesight, or which omega supplements facilitate better brain function, or even what combinations of food we should eat to increase our sex drive or our sleep -- or any other number of things that we cant to improve. But what about if we stopped for a second and played with a new idea. What if what we need isn't just about the healthy food we are putting in our bodies? What happens when our heart is hurting (emotionally speaking) or we're having a bad day, and no amount of kale salad or raw almonds is going to help us? It's only then when we may realize that there is something we might be missing. It's no secret that many of is have chocolate stashes in our freezer or cookies hiding out in the pantry for those ""just in case"" moments such as a breakup, a stressful day at work, or even a conflict with a family or friend. But what if we could also feed our hearts? What if we had an entire backup plan for those days when our hearts ache for just a little more comfort or nurturing? Or what if we nourished our hearts enough every single day so that we didn't actually need a stash of anything, anywhere?Spiritual nutrition for the heart is something I talk a lot about in my health counseling practice. I do spend lots of time talking about leafy greens and healthy fats and exercise and water intake. I even talk a lot about cravings and sugar and the importance of indulging in chocolate sometimes. But really, my main focus is on the deeper level, which is the heart level. Many of us spend so much time focusing on the physical aspect of our heart, such as adequate exercise, lower amounts of sodium, limited caffeine, etc. But what about the other parts of our heart that can't be seen on an X-ray or evaluated during a stress test, but can be felt just as deeply as a physical issue? About nine months ago, I began a pretty rigorous exercise routine. I went from not doing any exercise for most of my life (29 years) to working out with a personal trainer three times a week and adding in two days of yoga. I have been an extremely healthy eater for the past nine or so years, so that wasn't a challenge for me. And oddly enough, the physical exercise wasn't all that challenging for me, either. I began to get into a nice little rhythm with working out, eating my kale, making my green smoothies, and lowering my sodium and sugar intake. In no time at all, I began to feel great! I even started looking forward to my exercise days, and even exercising on my own in between my sessions with my trainer. In lots of ways, I felt energized, in touch with myself, healthier than I ever have been, and proud of myself for keeping my commitment. And it was even amazing to watch my body tone and become leaner and stronger and build endurance. I did this consistently for about four months. And then one day, I woke up feeling a little funny. I made a green smoothie and waited for it to ""kick in,"" but nothing happened. So I put my workout clothes on and went to meet with my trainer and had a great workout. But I walked away from the session feeling different than I usually did. I couldn't quite figure out what was going on, because I did the two things that normally ""make"" everything feel better, yet there was a feeling deep inside me that I couldn't seem to shake.I went through my day feeling strange. I kept trying things that usually helped me -- even taking a few omega and vitamin-B supplements to ""boost"" my energy level and mood. I met with clients, talked to friends on the phone, ran errands, and did my best to force myself to feel good. And then at around 5 p.m., while sitting at a traffic light, the tears began to flow. I cried softly at first, and then when the all-out sobbing began, I pulled off onto a quiet side street and just let it all go. I had images and memories flying through my mind, which seemed to trigger more and more tears. I cried like I did when I was 3 years old and my mother dropped me off at preschool for the first time. I cried as hard as I did when I was 7 and my sister moved across the country to go to college. And I cried almost as hard as I did the day when I put my dog to sleep when I was 27. And for some reason, all of these memories flooded my mind as I cried harder and harder until there was nothing left and it was 45 minutes later and the sun had set and my tear-stained face was red and puffy.Though I felt tired and pretty disoriented from crying so much and feeling so much intense emotion, that ""weird"" feeling I had all day had released. I instinctively placed my hand over my heart and pictured myself actually holding my heart -- and not just my physical heart, but the emotions and feelings and everything inside that I felt I had been neglecting for so long. I visioned my life for the past few months and how much ""work"" I had been doing with healthy eating and exercise and yoga and doing my best to do everything ""right."" But in that time, what I ""failed"" to do, was to nourish and nurture my heart while making all of those changes. In all that time, I didn't realize that I had sadness and anger and despair and unworthiness all trying to surface and be expressed and released. I didn't know at the time that as my body was undergoing all of the physical changes, my emotions were as well. And since my heart is the house of most of my emotions and feelings, I felt a little like I had neglected myself because clearly there was some serious self-care that needed to be happening. But instead of beating myself up (let's face it, I had done quite a bit of crying by this point!), I covered my heart with my right hand and just allowed myself to listen. What did I need in that moment? What did I want to do for myself that would help me feel safe, supported, and comforted? I closed my eyes and just connected with myself in a way I hadn't ever before. My heart needed dinner, a sweet treat, and to go home and snuggle in bed with a movie. I looked at the clock in my car to see that it wasn't even 6 p.m. yet and I was never one to get in bed before 10 p.m. But instead of fighting it, I picked up dinner and a treat, drove home, rented a movie on my laptop, and hopped in bed, where I spent the rest of the night truly giving myself what I needed.The lesson I learned in all of this is that my heart has needs that cannot be reached on a physical level. I live a busy life -- with clients and exercise routines and deadlines and emails -- just like everyone else. But somewhere in there, my heart needs to be fed. And not by someone else, but by me. I need to take the time out, every single day, and ask my heart what it needs. Do I need to cry? Do I need to talk to a friend? Do I need to take a nap or get in bed early or go watch the sunset or go snuggle with my dog? I am learning to listen to myself because I have found that only tending to the physical needs of my heart isn't enough. I need the nurturing. I long for the love I can give to myself, just through listening to myself. If we have heartburn, we can go to our doctor and get a prescription that will make it go away in two hours or less! But what about when we need something that medicine, or a doctor, or even a good five-mile run can't fulfill? Where are all the articles that tell us what to reach for when we are having a moment of feeling unworthy or lonely? The last time I checked, there wasn't a type of Girl Scout cookie called ""Peanut Butter Self-Nurturing Bars."" So the next time you go to reach for something, whether it be healthy food or a sweet treat that reminds you of childhood or even a protein shake, remember that your heart may actually be needing something else. Even after the most intense yoga or Pilates class, sometimes an energy bar just doesn't cut it because there's a deeper underlying issue going on. The truth is, we all have the skills and capability of taking a minute in our cars on the side of a quiet street in Los Angeles, and asking ourselves what we really need, emotionally. Because one way or another it's all going to come spilling out -- and what a beautiful thing it would be to be able to maintain the emotional state of our heart instead of playing damage control when we go too long without listening. Our heart deserves our undivided attention, because our hearts are one of the deepest parts of who we truly are.For more by Robin Hoffman, click here.For more on emotional wellness, click here."

I was just falling asleep last evening when I was awoken by a roommate knocking on my door. ""An MIT campus officer has been shot dead"" were the only words I registered before the word ""firefight"" was uttered. I was out of bed in a moment only to hear muffled pops and bangs in the distance. I then proceeded to wake up another roommate as the first put the news on in my bedroom. We all then gathered in my room for the long night until dawn full of sirens, helicopters, news speculations, and fear.We monitored police scanners, Twitter feeds, and live news reports for the rest of the night. Fear gripping us as we watched reports on the death of an innocent Campus Police officer and the serious wounding of a Transit officer were confirmed. Being only a short distance from the incident and the knowledge of the second suspect fleeing on foot, we were quite concerned. As soon as the sweeping of homes started we knew it was only an amount of time before they ended up at out door.I dozed off briefly around 6:30 this morning only to wake up to SWAT teams in full gear and the FBI hustling up my street, weapons drawn. Since then it has just been police officers and SWAT teams around and at my house all day. We have been told not to leave and remain in our homes. We have only been able to see what is happening outside our windows and what we see on the news channels. I don't think I can't say enough towards the dedication and the tenacity of our law enforcement officers. They have spent over 12 hours sweeping my town to ensure the safety of all its residents.

As I was drifting off, I saw the flashing blue and red lights bounce off the houses across my street. I heard shouts and scrambling feet hitting pavement as police officers ran toward their squad cars. I peeked through the blinds and saw a half dozen of them speeding down Nichols Ave., less than 200 yards from my apartment. I fell asleep wondering what the commotion was about, but didn't give it much thought.I woke up at 6:00 a.m. Friday in a haze because I was in a deep sleep. I turned over to find 10 missed calls and dozens of texts before the sun had even risen.My first reaction: Someone died. Someone back home in the Midwest died.Fearing the worst, I called my parents back and found out what was happening. The two suspects who were believed to have bombed the Boston Marathon on April 15 were at large and literally blocks away from me. The older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, 26, was shot and killed by police early Friday morning just down the road. The other, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, still loomed large and had the country in a panic.I live in Watertown, Mass., and I was in the thick of yet another crime scene to hit this wonderful city. I'm originally from Granite City, Ill., and moved to Watertown in September 2012 for a job. I've come to fall in love with this bustling town that hugs the border of Boston, located less than seven miles outside the heart of the city.Acts of terror struck Boston on Marathon Monday, a day of competition and spirit. The Boston Marathon tradition will never be the same. Now, after a week of living on edge and treading lightly, I've realized Boston and its surrounding neighborhoods will never be the same. Period.As if the events that unfolded Monday weren't horrific enough, on Friday, residents of Boston's surrounding towns awoke to a state of emergency. I didn't realize the gravity of the situation until I threw some water on my face and turned on the news. Since I woke up, I've been absorbing all the coverage. Television, online, what friends are telling me -- all conflicting, all overwhelming.Friends who know someone in the police force have said that the situation isn't as bad as the media is making it out to be -- no surprise there. This week has given a new definition to the phrase ""breaking news"" and what that means for us. It's difficult to discern what's reality versus hype.My phone went from fully charged to dying within four hours of nonstop texting and phone calls with loved ones. I kept my blinds shut but would occasionally crack a window to let some air in. Watertown residents -- like the rest of Boston and its surrounding towns -- were on lockdown. As of 6:00 p.m. Friday, I haven't stepped foot outside my apartment since Thursday evening.My apartment is on a generally quiet street in eastern Watertown, just down the street from an Armenian church, school and bakeries. I'm Armenian and Watertown is home to the third largest Armenian community in America, so my move to this specific area was no accident. I can walk down the street and buy fresh foods that remind me of home, hear people speaking Armenian outside my window and see Armenian writing on business awnings nearby.So to wake up in dismay and realize my new town was essentially under siege was both terrifying and infuriating. Within hours, at least a thousand of Massachusetts' finest swarmed Watertown. Choppers and the SWAT team descended upon the area. I could look out my window and see camouflage Humvees rolling down the street. I felt like I woke up in a war-torn country.I realize what Boston is going through is only a fraction of the horror those in the Middle East or Africa experience all day, every day. I'm not going to compare situations because the excessive complaints on Facebook and Twitter of people who state that obvious fact have driven me to avoid social media. I'm not ignorant of what's happening around the world, but that does not belittle what is happening here in my town.I take for granted how wonderful it is to live in a country where, on the average day, I do not fear for my life. I know not all Americans have that luxury. But ever since 9/11 and the upswing in mass shootings, I've been uneasy. This week has been a wakeup call that we are never truly safe.I've never been one to assume the worst in someone. Even after all that has transpired here this week, I can safely say that has not changed. I believe in the good in humanity. I don't believe we need to turn to blame and violence in order to find answers to questions we may never fully understand. The light will always push out the darkness, and even in the wake of tragedy and crime, I cling to that.I'm lucky. I woke up yesterday, safe in my apartment and put my feet on the ground. There just happened to be a looming threat outside. I realize others are not as fortunate. For that -- to have a roof over my head and a place to hide -- I am thankful.I'm thankful for our heroes in uniform -- law enforcement, SWAT team members, doctors and nurses. I'm thankful for those first responders and good Samaritans who ran toward danger on Marathon Monday to help their fellow man instead of running away scared.Terror looms every day, some days more than others. But to live in fear is possibly one of the biggest mistakes we can make. I live in the middle of this manhunt, but I do not live in fear.How long does it take to resume ""normal"" life? Time will tell. I can't speak for the grieving families and friends of those who have senselessly been killed because of this week's events. I can only grieve with them and hope they will find solace.But I do know none of us will ever fully return to normal. Just like Columbine, just like 9/11, this week -- especially Marathon Monday and yesterday with the suspect search -- will forever be ingrained in our memories. We'll always remember where we were and what we were doing when those bombs went off.We'll remember the weeping, the sadness, the injuries. We'll remember those rushed to hospitals, the confusion and the international attention.But most of all, we'll remember the hope and kindness in the aftermath. Or at least, I will. Because the tremendous outpour of support that has come in for the city of Boston is what is worth remembering. Boston is strong. It is not easily shaken. This will be a tragic series of events for its -- and American -- history, but it will not leave us living in fear.It started with chaos. I can only hope it ends with peace."
