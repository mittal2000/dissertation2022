0,MONEY,Black Friday 2012 Deals: What Not To Buy This Year,Caroline Fairchild,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/black-friday-2012-deals-what-not-to-buy_us_5b9c6193e4b03a1dcc7e3c37,"""In the old days, all of the great deals were on Black Friday, but now you see some great deals on Black Friday and lots",2012-10-08,"Early bird shoppers snatch up flat screen televisions at the Target store in Mayfield Hts., Ohio in the early hours of Friday, Nov. 25, 2011. Black Friday began in earnest as Target, Abercrombie & Fitch and other stores opened their doors at midnight.

Waiting until Black Friday could be a big mistake. Data from consumer-price research firm Decide Inc. shows that many of the holiday’s most popular gifts -- ranging from flat-screened TVs to stuffed animals -- are not sold at their lowest price on Black Friday. In fact, many items are cheaper at other times during the year. Decide Inc. discovered that a Samsung 46-inch LCD television averaged $1,159 in October from 2008 through 2011, but sold for around $1,355 on Black Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported. Female shoppers looking for Ugg Boots in September or October paid around $85 whereas Black Friday bargain hunters paid about $136 -- 59 percent more. Black Friday also might not be an ideal time to buy Apple products. Despite the hype usually associated with Apple’s Black Friday sale, items are typically only marked down around 5 to 10 percent. To score the real discounts, DealNews suggests taking advantage of the sales at retailers like Amazon and Best Buy who could offer around 25-percent off on Black Friday this year. ""In the old days, all of the great deals were on Black Friday, but now you see some great deals on Black Friday and lots of offers throughout the season,"" chief executive of electronic-toy maker LeapFrog Enterprises Inc. John Barbour told the Wall Street Journal. A record 226 million shoppers spent $52 billion dollars during last year’s Black Friday weekend, according to the National Federation of Retailers. The average customer spent $398.62 in 2011, up from $365.34 the year before. The best bargain shoppers have already noticed the trend and are starting their shopping before Thanksgiving. RetailMeNot.com, the largest online coupon site in the United States, recently found that close to 40 percent of shoppers begin their holiday spending before November. Some retailers have started to offer more deals before Black Friday as well. Last year, Amazon had a series of sales starting 24 days before Black Friday, Time Moneyland reports. New findings about Black Friday aside, timing remains crucial skill for shoppers looking to score a deal during other times of the year. For example the best time to buy a car typically comes at the end of the month when dealers are looking to fill quotas. Prices of airline tickets usually go up during the weekends making Tuesday the best day to book a flight. Generally, Sunday is the best day to buy groceries. Still craving the excitement that comes with busting down doors at midnight the night of Thanksgiving? Fear not. Some great deals still await you. Decide Inc. found that XBox gaming systems remain their cheapest on Black Friday with buyers saving more than $100. "

Why do I know this? Because I attended no less than six weddings in three months this summer. Mathematically speaking, that is all the weddings. And I have learned things about weddings, dear friends whose wedding I will one day attend. And know this: every wedding is beautiful.

(Photo by Vittorio Zunino Celotto/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c61ff2200008300d936e5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Most people know what I mean when I tell them my natural hair color is Avril-Lavigne-circa-2002. It's a dirty blonde that needs some serious highlights, as Elle Woods would say. Aside from my extended family, there were very few girls at school with blonde hair when I was growing up. My hair was something I felt set me apart. When I started college, though, blonde hair wasn't unique or special: it was everywhere. The stereotype of the blonde woman as perfect is a pervasive one. In movies and on TV, she's the sorority sister in pearls, the impeccable socialite, the chic housewife. It seems that there are implicit responsibilities that come with having blonde hair -- for women, anyway -- that we must be soft-spoken, agreeable and sweet. Spending time around soft-spoken, agreeable and sweet blondes, I remember feeling a disconnect between the person I was and the person other people expected me to be. Perfect blondes don't bomb their midterms, get blown off by the most gorgeous guy in school or hurl expletives at their mothers.Maintaining blonde hair is costly, too -- prohibitively so for most women. ""In general, blonde is the priciest hair color there is because it requires the most frequent, expensive upkeep,"" writes Andrea Pomerantz Lustig in her new book How to Look Expensive. Paying for highlights was no problem as a well-compensated high school babysitter, but it was a challenge as a college student earning minimum wage at the school gym. I wouldn't say I directly imitated her, but Ashlee Simpson planted the idea in my head: to set myself apart, I could simply dye my hair dark. The lure of a change so drastic and personal yet technically temporary was irresistible. I had always identified with other blondes, even fictional ones. Gwyneth Paltrow. Sabrina the Teenage Witch. Christina Aguilera. Barbie. My roots were coming in, making my hair look greasier than super-sized fries, and I knew I had to make a choice. I had had blonde hair my entire life. Who would I be without it? One box of brown hair dye later, I thought I had my answer: exactly the same. As early as the next morning, everyone seemed to have an opinion about my new hair. ""Oh! You, um, changed something,"" said my professor when taking attendance. There went my excuse for answering questions incorrectly. Not-my-boyfriend didn't say he didn't like my dark hair, but his one-word replies to my text messages said it for him. ""I don't know why you did it,"" said the woman who promptly stopped calling me to babysit. Did changing the color of my hair make me appear untrustworthy, or even unstable? Is hair color an unwritten contract in relationships, working or otherwise, or does a transition to the dark side simply make people uncomfortable? Light or dark. Blair or Serena. Pick a color and stick to it. I only had dark hair for a few months, but I got the impression during that time that I was more approachable to others. More of the gym patrons lingered to chat with me, which I didn't expect. Still, I didn't feel like myself as a brunette and gradually went back to blonde. In 2008, Satoshi Kanazawa of the London School of Economics debunked the ""dumb blonde"" stereotype in Psychology Today: ""It's not that blonde women are dumber than brunette women; it's that younger women are ""dumber"" (less knowledgeable, experienced and mature) than older women, and blonde hair is a reliable indicator of extreme youth."" While it certainly might seem like a drawback to have a hair color commonly associated with ineptitude, I have found the opposite is true. It is easy to exceed low expectations. Ivanka Trump, a blonde herself, knows that to be underestimated, often because of her last name, is an advantage in the business world. ""Maybe it's not the worst thing for people not to see you coming,"" she told New York magazine in 2005. ""If people want to underestimate me, I'm fine with that."""

The Girls’ Attitudes Survey, which polled approximately 1,200 girls and 600 boys ages seven to 21, found that female respondents were much more likely to define success as being confident and independent (56 percent) rather than being married (21 percent). In 2009, 56 percent of girls surveyed cited marriage as the thing they'd most like to achieve by age 30.Interestingly, boys and girls indicated that they felt differently about marriage: 46 percent of girls agreed that marriage is the best form of a relationship, compared to 56 percent of boys. Furthermore, only 32 percent of girls thought that married couples made better parents, compared to 47 percent of the boys surveyed.The report  states, ""Girls aged 11 to 21 are generally positive about marriage, although many are open-minded about whether this is the best or only option.""Chief Guide Gill Slocombe told BBC News: ""Girls still value family and marriage but they clearly do not see this as the absolute definition of success.""View the survey's full data here.What do you think about these attitudes towards marriage?

Within 10 weeks, he was gone. His loss was a stunning and heartbreaking blow.",2012-10-08,"Religion, death and dolor - funeral and cemetery; funeral with coffin",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c5dba3c0000320009bb2f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In early July of this year, just after I had completed writing and putting the finishing touches on my new book, Befriending Your Ex After Divorce: Making Life Better for You, Your Kids and Yes Your Ex, my 68-year-old ex-husband, Arnie Rabinor, was diagnosed with non-operable pancreatic cancer. Within 10 weeks, he was gone. He was buried three weeks ago.His loss was a stunning and heartbreaking blow. Although we had been divorced for 30 years, we were now good friends and closely connected. From the beginning of our divorce, our committment to coparenting our two children, Rachel who was 8 at the time, and Zachary, 12 created a bond. Eventually we both remarried, and our family expanded to include my husband Larry, Arnie's wife Irene and her daughter from a previous marriage, Ali. As the children all married and became parents -- and we became grandparents -- family milestones multiplied. Growing older, we knew how lucky we were to be able to share both the joyous celebrations as well as grieve family losses together. By now, Arnie and I had developed not only an expanded family, but a close, deep bond.  I had the privilege of speaking at his funeral, which at first, seemed so odd and daunting I almost begged out. Speaking at my ex-husband's funeral? Wasn't that out of the box? And how would I hold myself together?But I did hold myself together, and the writing of the eulogy offered me a quiet place to grieve privately. Delivering it allowed me to grieve publicly. Both experiences helped me come to grips with the loss of a man who had been an important part of my entire adult life as a husband, ex-husband and finally, a befriended ex.   Certainly, creating an amicable post-marital relationship wasn't seamless. It wasn't without anger and resentment -- all kinds of small and larger bumps in the road. But over time, we created new rituals and resurrected old ones: attending parent-teacher conferences together, cheering on our children at little league games and swim and gymnastic meets, and creating birthday parties that involved both parents. Negotiating with each other and our two children about the infinite details of everyday life allowed Arnie and I to shift from unhappy marital partners to happier co-parents. Slowly, we learned to develop trust in each other's decisions and judgments, to let go of old scripts and to create new ones that supported our children and family's well being. All that I said in the eulogy, as I recounted our 45-year history.After the funeral, we sat shiva at Arnie's house. Among the hoards of mourners was Rob, a friend and neighbor. I had known Rob and his ex-wife, Anita, for many years, as they were the parents of one of my son's friends.  ""Judy,"" he said, ""I want to talk to you."" He asked me to step outside and sit on the stoop with him. ""Your eulogy moved me to tears,"" he said. ""I realized that if I wanted things to change between Anita and me, the time is now."" He explained that earlier that day, right after the funeral, he had called his ex-wife and invited her and her husband along with all their children, to share a holiday meal at the home he now shared with his wife. As Rob spoke, I noticed how agitated he had become. I asked him what was happening, and it all poured out -- all the ways he and Anita had hurt one another in the past. ""I'm hoping we can start over,"" he said, tears in his eyes, ""Anita isn't a bad person, we just couldn't make a go of our marriage. But now I'm hoping things will be different. Now that she's married, maybe she will be more forgiving. I'm hoping we can develop the kind of relationship you talked about. When you talked about how you and Arnie learned to get along, I knew that's what I really want is a better divorce.""  After Rob left, I sat on the stoop, thinking about Rob, Anita and their children -- about to share a holiday meal together for the first time in the five years since they'd divorced. If I was religious, I might have prayed for them, but not being so inclined, I decided to just send them my positive energy. For I knew what they were facing was daunting, yet well worth the trouble.As I sat there, I remembered more details of my own bumpy journey with Arnie -- from falling madly in love at 23 and being thrilled to be getting married to him, to feeling disappointed, angry, crazed and falling out of love. And finally -- after a great deal of inner turmoil and agony -- getting divorced. And then, much to my surprise, came the slow journey back to the friendship we ultimately created, as we inched along, lurched along and gave birth to a new relationship: befriended exes. ""She's not a bad person -- we just couldn't make a go of our marriage."" Rob's words echoed. Those were the very words I could have said decades ago when I described the disintegration of my marriage. But now, as I sat there in the twilight, I knew just how very lucky I had been: to have found peace with my close friend Arnie before the gates closed.-------------------------------------------- If you have a story to tell about your relationship with your ex, please contact me at judithruskayrabinorphd.com.

(AP Foto/Susan Walsh)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c615b2200003000d93690.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Like many other Americans I was stoked for the presidential debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney. I'm an esthetician and Wednesdays from 2-8 p.m. are spent working at the spa. The debate began at 9 p.m. so I prayed that my last client wouldn't be late or someone new who would have fifty bazillion questions about their skin. As it turned out my last appointment was a regular client who was on time. I was able to hustle home, prepare dinner and be comfortably seated with my husband in enough time to wage our own little debate about which station we would watch the coverage on. As he channel surfed I caught a glimpse of Michelle Obama looking radiant and of course my first thought was ""I wonder who's doing her facials""? (Skin care is how I make my living after all.) I wondered if the FLOTUS sneaks out of the White House to the private treatment room of some master facialist, available only to a select group of socialites. Perhaps her brilliant makeup artist is performing a dual role and is also responsible for her complexion perfection. Or it could be that she's a fan of the relaxing ""do it yourself facial"", preferring to pamper herself using ingredients from the refrigerator like eggs, mayonnaise, lemon juice, papaya or avocado. That wouldn't be too surprising since she loves to garden and is such a health advocate. I turned my attention to her husband as the debates began but this question stayed in the back of my mind for a very good reason. A few years ago I had a group of six young African-American female attorneys coming to me every couple of months or so for their facials. They were all single, gorgeous, chic and blessed with skin the color of rich dark chocolate. I used to tease them that they only allowed women of a particular hue into their inner circle. Interestingly, they told me that they had all been drawn together as mutual support in law school due to the snide comments and inequities they'd experienced as a direct result of their dark skin, so to a certain extent I was correct. They were extremely diligent about keeping their complexions as perfect as possible and always asked about the latest skin technology and best products. They were largely the impetus for my blog, Ethnic Skin Aficionado because I never had enough time to answer all of their questions. When President Obama was inaugurated in 2009 they all relocated to Washington, DC to be closer to the action. It was a very exciting time for them and I would receive emails frequently, updating me on their apartment hunting status, love-life or new job. They would also write about the difficulties in finding a new facialist who understood the intricacies of their skin. I knew that they were very particular and assembling a new glam squad can be a daunting task, but at some point they would find the service provider they needed.   About four months later on a Saturday morning when I checked my client schedule for the day I saw that two of my attorneys had booked appointments with me. They had been unable to find anyone in their new city to perform a facial to their satisfaction. I asked them how that was possible, after all our nation's capital is a hotbed of cultural and ethnic diversity. I mentioned three major international hotel chains with fabulous spa facilities. They told me that their group had been to all of them, found them to be visually beautiful yet disappointing in their service and knowledge of darker skin. And, they also informed me, I would be seeing the rest of their crew in the upcoming weeks. I have to admit that to a certain extent I felt flattered. But a much larger part of me felt frustration, anger and dismay. In 2009, why should African-American women have to get on a train or take a road trip and travel for two hours to have facial services with someone knowledgeable? Partially as justification I told myself that part of my allure is the vast range of international products offered by our spa. An excellent product line can serve to enhance the skills of any good esthetician. But I also had to acknowledge that I personally have been to more ""luxury"" spas than I care to remember which had fantastic product selections but substandard service. It's perplexing that for years the salon industry and product manufacturers have recognized diversity by offering services and products which address not only ethnic specific but bi-racial hair needs as well. The spa industry remains relentlessly apathetic and unapologetically uneducated in caring for the skin of 80 percent of the world's population.I believe that in the past, women of color were simply not taken into consideration in the skin care industry. However, in 2011 ethnic beauty sales generated 1.5 trillion dollars in the global market. The First Lady of the free world is a glamorous African-American. New consumer markets are emerging and the fastest growing demographics are bi-racials, Asians and Hispanics. It is essential for all women of color who love going to spas to ask prior to booking an appointment if there is someone there who is knowledgeable about their skin. Luxury hotel groups and spa chains from Dubai to D.C. are long overdue in recognizing their ethnic customer and offering equal skin care by trained qualified professionals. In the not too distant future some forward thinking business owner will recognize the opportunity and capture the ethnic esthetic market. Until then I stand at the ready to do Mrs. Obama's facial. It's my duty as a patriot.   Linda Harding-Bond is President of Moontide Consulting, specializing in ethnic skin & retail training with a global perspective."

Which is a big bummer considering that their country is so beautiful and their food is so yummy and healthy.So we are keeping good thoughts for good changes and in the meantime, we are psyched to get a taste of what is to come, courtesy of Eat Well Venezuela correspondent Marianella Herrera, MD, MSc. Arepas We tend to associate rice with most traditional Latin diets, but the staple grain in Venezuela is actually corn, most commonly enjoyed as arepas. Arepas are a pancake-like cornbread, way thinner than the cheese/corn bombs served at Manhattan street fairs. They're eaten as an accompaniment with entrees, or topped with protein to make a small meal (in this case they might take the form of a stuffed cornbread pocket, sort of like Venezuelan pita bread).Arepas can make a great, healthy breakfast or light lunch if you choose the right fillings. Lean proteins like fish, chicken and turkey or sliced avocado are the perfect additions to this gluten-free, whole-grain base. Since arepas constitute daily fare for Venezuelans there are plenty of places to grab one, but Marinella has recommended two in particular if your travels bring you to Caracas: El Budare de la Castellana which is considered the definitive spot for arepas in the La Castenella section of the city (5475 Av. Principal de la Castellana, La Castellana, Caracas); and Tostadas Bello Monte which has been serving them up for more than 50 years (Av. Principal de Bello Monte, Colinas de Bello Monte, Caracas).Chocolate Yes, that's right. I said chocolate. And it IS good for you. Really. It's because cocoa is derived from a plant, and, like all plants, it contains health-promoting phytochemicals. The cocoa bean has been touted for its potential antioxidant qualities in particular, which can help protect against heart disease.Turns out the world's highest-rated cocoa comes from Venezuela -- in fact, chances are good that when you're eating fancy Swiss chocolate, it's been made with Venezuelan cocoa. If you are in Barlovento, Chuao, Sur del Lago or Paria (the major cocoa producing regions of the country), treat yourself to a sampling of the local goods. Just remember, keep it dark to avoid added sugar and saturated fats (65% or higher), and indulge in moderation. Heart healthy does not mean calorie free!Cheese Venezuelans spend a fair amount of time in the dairy section of the supermarket. While full-fat dairy should be limited due to its high saturated fat content, moderate amounts of low-fat cheese are a good source of calcium and can be part of a healthy, balanced diet. According to Marinella, the fresh white cheeses of Venezuela are worth the splurge. Plus, these particular types of cheese actually have less fat and fewer calories than their traditional aged counterparts. Cuajada Andina or any type of goat cheese are naturally lowest in fat and so are good options if you're keeping an eye on calories (so you can eat more chocolate, obviously).Ají Dulce The ají dulce is a small pepper related to the habanero, but is sweeter with less intense heat. It is a quintessential flavor in Venezuelan cooking. And the ají dulce doesn't just bring taste and aroma to the party -- it's also rich in vitamin C and anitoxidants (remember them from the cocoa bean)? The unique flavor of these peppers really shines in guasacaca, a basic sauce of onions, ají dulce, cilantro, avocados and tomatoes. Try guasacaca on some of Venezuela's local beef, which is always grass-fed.For more of Marinella's tips on where to find delicious, healthy food in Venezuela, download the Eat Well Venezuela app from the I Tunes Store or Android Market."

So imagine keeping up a regime when you're nine months pregnant. Sound impossible? It's not, according to celebrity trainer Tracey Anderson and her ""momshell"" devotees, including professional beautiful people Christy Turlington, who frequents her New York City studio, business partner Gwyneth Paltrow and new mom and client Molly Sims. HuffPost Healthy Living caught up with these famous moms at an event to celebrate the launch of Anderson's ""The Pregnancy Project"" -- a fitness system for pregnant women in each month of pregnancy. The DVDs will support maternal health worldwide, donating $5 of each purchase to Christy Turlington Burns' advocacy project, Every Mother Counts. So how did some of the world's most famous moms stay fit during and after pregnancy? Read on for tips straight from their lips: On working out while pregnant:""It's very important to move when you’re pregnant. Well, if you’re sick you have to lie in bed -- I did!"" said Paltrow, mother to Apple, 8, and Moses, 6, with her husband, Coldplay frontman Chris Martin. ""But as long as you’re okay to get up and at least walk and really try to keep blood circulating.”""Look, you can’t do as much,"" said Sims, who gave birth to son Brooks just 3 1/2 months ago. ""For me, I got pregnant on my honeymoon, so I’d just gotten into fabulous shape [for the wedding] and then you start all over again. So you know, you see the scale go up instead of down and that’s a little frustrating. I think it's just, you know, dealing with becoming winded, really being exhausted, trying to do arm work while you’re nauseated."" On ""getting your body back"":""You know, give yourself a break. Nobody knows what it's going to feel like as a mom until it happens,"" said Turlington Burns, mother to daughter Grace, 9, and son Finn, 6, with her husband, the director and actor Ed Burns. ""I don’t think there should be that kind of pressure. I think we should forgive ourselves. It's important to feel rested and to get back to yourself internally before you care about what you look like externally. But I think eventually, there’s no reason why you shouldn’t have the life you had before kids in terms of physical activity. It’s empowering to feel good and to feel like, 'Yeah, I brought you into the world and I still look good.'""""My number one thing is that I'm a big breastfeeding advocate,"" said Anderson, who gave birth to daughter Penelope four months ago and who also has a 14-year-old son, Sam. ""The body will naturally pull back a lot from breastfeeding. But then, once your doctor releases you to work out, then you can use all those joints that have been relaxed to move around. But make sure that they do not start to work out before the doctor says its okay, even if they feel like it. There were some things [said] about me: that I got my body back in six weeks. Not true. I didn’t move a muscle for six weeks.""""I think the biggest motivating factor getting back into shape is that I want to fit into my clothes!"" said Sims. ""I don’t fit into anything. I fit into like 10 things -- that I want to burn.”On the importance of fitness for maternal health:""Pregnancy, as wonderful as it is, makes us very vulnerable,"" said Turlington Burns. ""It just does. It makes us susceptible to gestational diabetes, preclampsia, things that are harmful. So the better foundation you have going in, the more healthy you’ll feel and the better outcome you’ll have with the delivery and the baby.""On the global mission for maternal health:""As I was creating this program, I was thinking, 'This is such a luxurious item for women to have, this thing to help them keep their butts in shape,'"" said Anderson. ""And my friend Christy has this amazing charity where she helps women who don’t even have basic access to care. We are talking women who are 10 miles from the closest natal center. Pregnancy was hard enough with all the support and modern medicine that I had. She's fighting the fight that's significant and serious. Nothing is more important.”On working out with your kids:""Physical fitness is incredibly important for overall health and mental health, heart health and cholesterol and everything and I think it's a really important part of being a kid to be active. My son likes to do soccer and kickboxing and Apple’s very into dance and gymnastics,"" said Paltrow. ""Every day after school, we have a little scrimmage together in the garden.”"
