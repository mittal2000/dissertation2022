3,HEALTHY LIVING,'I'm Not Looking To Be Saved From Narcolepsy',"Julie Flygare, ContributorFounder of Project Sleep, Narcolepsy Spokesperson & Author",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/narcolepsy_b_5656778.html,"I'm not Wonder Woman, far from it. Narcolepsy challenges me daily. I take medication twice a day and twice a night, both of which cause unpleasant side-effects. And I still have sleep attacks and cataplexy every day.",2014-08-10,2014-08-07-julieflygarenarcolepsyadvocateauthorrunnerblogger.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-08-07-julieflygarenarcolepsyadvocateauthorrunnerblogger-thumb.jpg,"""Are you religious?"" My brow furrowed with confusion. I'd just told this family friend, a retired dentist, that I had narcolepsy. I wasn't sure why he was asking about religion.  ""I consider myself spiritual, but not religious,"" I stammered. ""Do you pray?"" ""No..."" ""See, that's the problem,"" he explained with enthusiasm. ""All you need for a good night's sleep is peace of mind. You need to get in touch with the Man Upstairs for peace of mind.""My eyes fell to the ground, as I searched for words to respond, but I quickly realized that we would not agree. When I tell people I have narcolepsy, I often get questions like: ""Have you tried yoga?"" ""What about vitamin D?"" and ""Do you pray?"" People are well-intentioned and solution-oriented. I understand. Sure, it's a bit frustrating that someone learning of narcolepsy for the first time thinks they know of a solution or cure that I'm unaware of, even though I've lived with narcolepsy for many years. But still, forgivable.But what bothers me most about these suggestions is that by sharing that I have narcolepsy, many people assume that I have a problem and I'm looking for a solution. So let me be clear: I, Julie Flygare, am not looking to be saved from narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is a neurological disorder of the sleep/wake cycle affecting 1 in 2,000 people worldwide. I experience excessive sleepiness daily. When I laugh, my knees sometimes buckle or my whole body collapses -- a paralyzing symptom called cataplexy. In addition, frightening hallucinations surround my sleep. Yet, narcolepsy is a part of me, much like my hair color and ethnic heritage. I am proud to be a person with narcolepsy. Since being diagnosed, I've run the Boston Marathon, become a national spokesperson, founded a non-profit and published a memoir. I never imagined accomplishing so much in a lifetime, never mind in my 20s.I'm not Wonder Woman, far from it. Narcolepsy challenges me daily. I take medication twice a day and twice a night, both of which cause unpleasant side-effects. And I still have sleep attacks and cataplexy every day. I cried in the pharmacy parking lot recently after dealing with red tape insurance issues and a brash pharmacist. The list of obstacles goes on and on. But for me, narcolepsy cannot be classified as good or evil. Sometimes it is a source of fierce frustration, other times a source of infinite passion and drive. Instead of running from my discomforts, I now choose to stand still, watching them shift like the tide. Before you feel bad for me or offer solutions, consider that your fears are not necessarily my fears. Your feelings about my illness may not match mine.I am open to improvements and have tried many lifestyle changes and alternative treatments. I believe in a strong mind-body connection, especially when it comes to the immune system. But I also believe that the body is complicated and layered beyond modern medicine and alternative therapies.Simply put, some things are not easily fixable. If someone has a tooth cavity, can they pray it away? If someone breaks an arm, would yoga heal the break? Interestingly, people with narcolepsy are missing 90-95 percent of the neurons that regulate the boundaries between sleep and wakefulness in the brain. Although this cell loss is invisible to the naked eye, it's still very real.By insisting on easy solutions, my experience feels invalid -- as if narcolepsy is somehow in my control or my fault. This makes me feel ashamed and guilty. If only I exercised more... If only I wasn't stressed... If only I was healthier... This shame is worse than any illness. This self-guilt is more toxic than any disease.  In my opinion, there is an over-emphasis on finding quick fixes and avoiding discomfort in our culture, as opposed to leaning in and seeing where our challenges take us. We forget that difficulty is a part of life, and no amount of yoga, dietary changes, prayers or medications will make us immortal.Learn more: www.julieflygare.com All Photos Copyright (c) Julie Flygare"
4,GREEN,Just How Dangerous Are Thunderstorms?,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/thunderstorms-safety_n_5662691.html,,2014-08-10,"Clouds gather over the Suleymaniye Mosque (R) during a storm on August 7, 2014, in Istanbul. AFP PHOTO/BULENT KILIC (Photo credit should read BULENT KILIC/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb15bcd240000310096c03b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This story originally appeared on Mother Nature Network.Down here in South Florida, thunderstorms are a daily (sometimes even a few times daily) occurrence. Usually occurring in the late afternoon, thunderstorms afford me the perfect opportunity to curl up on the couch with a cup of hot tea and a good book. Even more enticing is a nap, which seems to be deeper and more satisfying when there’s a thunderstorm raging outside. (Alas, I have trouble convincing the preschoolers at home with me that a nap is the best use of the 4 o’clock hour … but I digress.) The question here is what precautions you should take in the event of a big storm?  If you don’t take the necessary precautions, thunderstorms can be dangerous, mostly because they come with lightning. On average, lightning is the cause of 67 American deaths and more than 300 injuries every year. So it's helpful to have a review of thunderstorm do's and don'ts.  1. Take cover. If you’re outside in a thunderstorm, get indoors as soon as you can, preferably in a sturdy building, and not a rain shelter or stand-alone temporary structure (like a porta-potty or a shed, for example). These structures do not provide adequate protection from lightning. If you had planned an outdoor activity, postpone it until after the storm passes.  2. Pull over. If you’re driving, park at the closest safe spot (or exit, if you’re on the highway) and put on your flashers until the heavy rain stops. If you decide to keep driving, avoid touching any metal part of the car. If lightning strikes your car, it’ll act as a metal box that will prevent the electricity from getting to you, as long as you are not touching any metal on the car itself.  3. Avoid contact with electronics. Do not use appliances plugged into wall outlets. Unplug any electronic equipment such as your computer and TV before the storm hits. Lightning can cause an electrical surge that can damage these devices. I have firsthand experience with this one. We had our TV on during a recent storm; when the power went out, the TV went with it and hasn’t worked since. Cellphones and cordless phones are fine to use.  4. Stay out of the tub. You’ve heard the old wives' tale: Never take a bath or a shower in a thunderstorm or you could get electrocuted. Turns out this little myth is not a myth at all. Lightning can be carried through your plumbing and, if you’re in the water or touch a faucet, it can shock you. Better to wait until the storm passes to bathe, or even wash dishes, for that matter.  5. Avoid natural lightning rods. If you do happen to be stuck outside when a thunderstorm hits, don’t shelter under a large tree because trees act as natural lightning rods. If they are struck by lightning, branches can fall and injure you or worse. Stay away from lakes, ponds, railroad tracks and fences — all these things that can transfer electrical current to you if struck by lightning. Of course, also stay away from downed power lines.  A little bit of common sense goes a long way when it comes to staying safe in a thunderstorm. Your best bet is to stay indoors and take a nap or break out the board games. As Gary Allan sings, “Every storm runs out of rain.” That it does, Gary, that it does."

Tens of thousands of evangelical Christians from across Peru converged on Lima this month for a nearly week-long national congress, their leaders claiming one of Latin Americaâs biggest growth rates. (AP Photo/Karel Navarro)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7ed582600002d018370e4.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON/LIMA, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Losing the fight against same-sex marriage at home, leading U.S. Evangelical Christians are joining in the culture wars in Latin America as cheerleaders for opponents of gay legal partnerships, abortion and pornography.One of the Americans is veteran legal crusader Mat Staver who was both a disciple of late Moral Majority co-founder Jerry Falwell and the leader of a campaign against the removal of religious symbols from celebrations of Christmas in stores and public buildings.The other is Samuel Rodriguez, a dynamic Latino preacher with strong ties with Republican and Democratic lawmakers in Washington D.C. who describes his religion as mixing Martin Luther King Jnr. with televangelist Billy Graham and then ""putting a little salsa on top.""Working together, both men increased their influence in Latin America in April when a U.S. Hispanic Evangelical group that they help to run took over one of the region's oldest Evangelical organizations.""Because of what was happening in Latin America and what we are fighting here in America there needed to be a combination to be able to create a firewall for our Judeo-Christian values. That is what ultimately brought about this merger,"" Staver told his Faith and Freedom radio show.The new group -- known as NHCLC/CONELA and headed by Rodriguez -- boasts a network of socially conservative pastors in Latin America who it is asking to be more politically active.The many left-leaning governments in Latin America will not be easily swayed by U.S.-backed conservatives and the fight against gay marriage has already been lost in Argentina, Uruguay and Mexico City, which have legalized it in the last four years. But the alliance of U.S. and Latin American Evangelicals is having some success in Peru, where a conservative lawmaker who is an NHCLC/CONELA officeholder is blocking a bill in Congress that would allow gay civil unions.Staver gave the lawmaker, Julio Rosas, moral support by speaking to an audience of social conservatives at a legal conference in a hall of the Peruvian Congress last November.""I urged them to stand strong"" against abortion and same-sex marriage, the U.S. Evangelical said in an interview.Staver is a hardened cultural warrior who was a friend and legal advisor to Falwell. He successfully defended the televangelist from a complaint at the Federal Election Commission that Falwell broke federal election law by calling on his supporters to back President George W. Bush's re-election in 2004.Staver heads the law faculty at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia which was founded by Falwell and is run by the late Baptist's son, also named Jerry.Staver has argued against abortion rights before the U.S. Supreme Court. His Liberty Counsel non-profit law firm led the charge over the last decade against the ""War on Christmas"" by threatening to sue stores and government agencies for secularizing the Christmas holiday. ""AGGRESSIVE"" OPPOSITIONLegal counsel for NHCLC/CONELA, Staver said one of his motivations for becoming involved in Latin America is that the U.S. government via the State Department is funding gay rights groups in other parts of the world, unsettling Latin American conservatives.""They were looking to us in America for help. Why? Because America through this current administration has been using a bully pulpit to try to tell them what to do on abortion and homosexuality and they don't like that,"" he said.Staver's Peruvian ally, lawmaker Rosas, was one of the leaders of a ""March for Family"" in May against the gay civil unions bill. Rosas said nearly a million signatures against the legislation were delivered to Congress days later.The justice committee is expected to take up the civil union measure in coming months, but even supporters say it is unlikely to pass, in part because of strident opposition from Rosas.""I expected a strong reaction from the Catholic Church, but I didn't expect Evangelicals to be so aggressive,"" said the bill's author, Carlos Bruce, who came out publicly as gay while promoting the legislation. ""I think it's the first time the Evangelical church has such a strong political presence"" in Peru.Critics accuse Staver and Rodriguez of trying to repeat the performance of visiting U.S. Evangelicals who urged church and government leaders in Uganda to crack down on gay activism. That led to the African country banning homosexuality in February, a move that was rejected by the constitutional court this month.American conservative Christians, including Massachusetts pastor Scott Lively who later hired Staver as his lawyer, were widely accredited with fostering an anti-gay climate in Uganda through a series of speeches to lawmakers and opinion makers there. POLITICAL PASTORS""If I were to speculate, the Religious Right in the U.S. sees the writing on the wall regarding gay marriage, and are going to try to influence global movements in Latin American and Africa - two places that still have very strong anti-gay secular and religious sentiments,"" said Arlene Sanchez-Walsh, a Latino church expert at Azusa Pacific University in California.The number of Evangelicals in Latin America is growing but exact figures are elusive. A 2012 report by the U.S.-based Pew Research Center Religion and Public Life Project estimated 98 million Protestants in Latin America and the Caribbean, or 18 percent of the Christian population there.Staver says he wants the new U.S.-Latin American group to expand into the Caribbean, boost operations in Mexico and train pastors throughout Latin America, starting in Peru in 2015, on how to conduct political campaigns.California-based Hispanic preacher Rodriguez will be key to any growth in Latin America.He will travel to Argentina later this year to meet conservative pastors and has named a NHCLC/CONELA leader in Mexico who has begun meeting state governors to persuade them to crack down on pornography and defend traditional family values.He said he is encouraging affiliated preachers in Mexico to become more involved in politics to defend traditional family values, fight poverty and promote education.""Yes, I can't deny that we are asking Evangelicals in Mexico to rise up and become very engaged and to defend Biblical truth and religious liberty to stand up for family and faith,"" he told Reuters.Described by U.S. Spanish-language television channel Telemundo as ""leader of the Hispanic Evangelical movement,"" Rodriguez has political connections on both sides of the aisle in Washington. He led prayers at the Republican Party convention that nominated Mitt Romney as the 2012 presidential candidate.Rodriguez said he has grand ambitions for his U.S.-Latin American group to ""serve as the catalyst for the global revitalization of Evangelicalism.""NHCLC/CONELA calls itself perhaps the world's biggest Protestant network with 500,000 affiliated churches, although academics and other Latin American Evangelical Christians dismiss that number as far too high.

WILDFIRES AND FLOODSHickenlooper's Republican opponent, former congressman Bob Beauprez, dismayed the governor's supporters last month when he held off a GOP primary challenge from a maverick and polarizing contender, Tom Tancredo.Beauprez's credentials bring him funding, and he'll need it. In their first head-to-head month, Hickenlooper raised about $353,000 from late June to late July, while Beauprez brought in around $261,000, campaign finance figures show.Overall, Hickenlooper has raised some $3.4 million, and his team says it has spent $1.4 million on TV ads for the fall.They appear to be running neck-and-neck, with one reputable poll last month giving the governor a 6-point lead, then just a day later another poll giving Beauprez a 1-point edge.The second survey, by Quinnipiac University, said Hickenlooper's job approval rating fell to 48 percent, from 52 percent in April.Still, that's a far cry from the 66 percent approval he enjoyed in late 2012, after being hailed for his calm response to the state's worst-ever wildfire, and then a deadly shooting rampage at a suburban Denver movie theater.He also won plaudits last year when more devastating wildfires were followed by widespread floods, some of which he toured on crutches after having hip surgery.It is the stricter gun laws he approved after the movie theater massacre that triggered his opponents' most vitriolic attacks. They also prompted most of Colorado's elected sheriffs to sue in federal court to try to block them, saying they severely restricted citizens' constitutional right to own and bear arms.That lawsuit failed, but at a meeting with the sheriffs in Aspen in June, the governor said his administration had ""screwed up"" the issue of expanded background checks for gun buyers.""I guess I didn't get it,"" Hickenlooper said. RIVALS SMELL BLOODSupporters say he was trying to seek common ground with opponents, but his rivals smelled blood.Beauprez called it a ""bizarre"" explanation that he said typified Hickenlooper's lack of leadership. He also cited the decision to grant a temporary reprieve to the state's longest-serving death row inmate, who was slated for execution last year until the governor intervened.""If he won't lead, I will,"" Beauprez told Reuters.The former congressman, who sold the family's dairy farm to develop a golf resort then made his fortune in banking, lost a gubernatorial race eight years ago to then-Denver District Attorney Bill Ritter.Beauprez will also try to score against Hickenlooper over his backing for a renewable energy mandate that Beauprez said would hurt rural schools and hospitals by raising rates, as well as a failed $950 million tax hike for education reform proposed by the Democratic-led legislature.Hickenlooper is fighting back. He says Colorado has gained more than 200,000 jobs since he took office, seen 32 consecutive months of job growth, and that unemployment has dropped from 9.1 percent in 2010 to 5.5 percent in June.He hailed a deal he brokered in the fracking debate , and last month he named more than 120 prominent Democrats, Republicans and independents who he says support him.They include some former donors to the Beauprez campaign such as Chad and Troy McWhinney, founders of the company that bears their name and which leads the redevelopment of Denver's recently reopened Union Station.""Colorado has come so far in just a few years,"" the governor said in a statement. ""We must keep our momentum going."" (Reporting by Daniel Wallis and Keith Coffman; Editing by Eric Beech)"

Screen shot of Sawt Al Aseer tweetSawt Al Aseer, or Voice of Al Aseer, posted a picture of unknown origin shot from Lafayette Square across from the White House with an IS flag superimposed on it. Al Aseer is accused of fomenting sedition. He has a beef with the government and the Shiite Hezbollah (Party of God). The cleric also fought pitched urban battles near the southern port city of Sidon with the army before slipping out of sight. Social media rumors targeted Hezbollah-owned TV station Al Manar with unfounded reports that female presenter Kawthar Al Moussawi had died in a horrific traffic accident. Screen shot of Al Manar's Kawthar Al Moussawi""There should be some law, some restraint, because that's not the way stories are reported...I feel like having fun so I spread a rumor and see what the reaction will be,"" said Al Moussawi about the account that set off a spate of concerned calls and other reports.Journalists, bloggers and social media denizens, wittingly or not, contribute to the charged sectarian environment gripping the country. ""Journalists today are under the tyranny of a click,"" opined journalist-cum-media lecturer Rouba El Helou. ""The power of the Internet, the impact of the scoop, and who is first to publish has turned journalists into 'rumors seekers' and is done regardless of the substance they publish."" Rouba El Helou (courtesy El Helou)While she believes good journalism will always exist worldwide, it may have fallen into the trap of search engine optimization SEO, and the monopoly of corporations. ""Some journalists argue, while defending the spread of rumors, that this is how things are...Very few journalists unfortunately will take the time to check names, spelling, events or incidents.""But if activists have their way, rumors and sedition will be nipped in the bud.""Kamashtak!"" (Gotcha!) is a website dedicated to monitoring TV, print, online and social media for provocative stories by using a ""Fitni Meter"" (sedition gauge). Screen shot of Kamashtak's home pageRumors of a bomb-packed car on Beirut's busy Hamra Street paralyzed traffic and activity, prompting merchants to demand installation of surveillance cameras and improved protection. The January 2014 report was hardly new. Car bombs have been de rigueur since Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war. Their use has ebbed and flowed ever since it ended.""Between one explosion and another, the media's rumors are deadly,"" headlined an article in the daily Assafir.   The article quoted a politician boasting he had floated a rumor years back that led to rising hatred of Syrians by Lebanese citizens, predating the influx of over a million and a half Syrian refugees from their war-torn country.Elsewhere, an accumulation of local and regional setbacks in recent years has exacerbated Lebanon's already fragile economy that relies heavily on tourism, services and expatriate remittances.  So when a leading business employing hundreds of Lebanese reportedly decided to pull up stakes, fears the impact would destabilize the economy spread widely.Rumors in 2013 that the Kuwait-owned Americana Group food franchise planned to close shop sent tremors across various economic sectors that benefited from the firm's restaurant chains. Suppliers dreaded revenue losses, employees worried about the prospect of unemployment, and franchise owners saw their businesses go up in smoke.The rumors were actually an exaggeration. Americana had decided to reduce its workforce by downsizing some of its chains' brands in Lebanon following a significant drop in tourism.The franchises include Krispy Kreme, Pizza Hut, Hardees, KFC, Costa Coffee and Grand Café.According to Octavia Nasr, founder of Bridges Media Consult and former Arab affairs editor at CNN:In an extremely fast moving universe thanks to the availability of social networks, rumors are thriving because anyone can participate in disseminating information. Reporters and editors have many new sources of information that they can't ignore but can't trust either. This makes the role of verification a lot more essential and much harder than it ever was in the history of our profession. Nasr, who was an early adopter of digital media, and co-creator of CNN's original strategy for integrating social media in news gathering and reporting, said that in many cases, the desire to be first was damaging the necessity to be accurate which is the backbone of any media's credibility.  She added:That's why a five-year startup like Storyful is acquired for millions of dollars and hired by media organizations to vet and verify the massive amounts of information coming from all Internet sources in the field. Twenty years ago journalists had plenty of time to gather information and confirm news or debunk rumors and ignore stories altogether. This is simply impossible today. The agenda and speed are set by social media users and this is evident in the role social media play in gathering information as well as providing feedback to coverage and reaction to news."

17,WORLDPOST,Liberians Fill Churches In Defiance Of Official Ebola Warnings,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/liberian-ebola-outbreak_n_5666237.html,,2014-08-10,"Coulibaly Daouda, head of the epidemiological department at the national public health institute in Abidjan poses as he holds a poster reading ''Ebola fever'', on August 8, 2014. The World Health Organization declared the killer Ebola epidemic ravaging parts of west Africa an international health emergency and appealed for global aid to help afflicted countries. States of emergency have been declared in the hardest hit countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, while two people have died in Nigeria and Benin is investigating a suspect patient. AFP PHOTO/ SIA KAMBOU (Photo credit should read ISSOUF SANOGO/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13b902400003200381c43.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Clair MacDougallMONROVIA, Aug 10 (Reuters) - Liberians packed churches in the capital Monrovia on Sunday to seek solace from an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus, defying official warnings to avoid public gatherings to try to contain an epidemic that has killed nearly 1,000 people in West Africa.With its creaking healthcare system completely overrun, Liberia declared a state of emergency last week to tackle the highly contagious and incurable disease, which has also stricken neighboring Sierra Leone, Guinea and Nigeria.People still flocked to sing and pray in churches in the ramshackle ocean-front capital, many of them comparing Ebola to the brutal civil war that ravaged the country between 1989 and 2003, killing nearly a quarter of a million people.""Everyone is so afraid,"" said Martee Jones Seator at Saint Peter's Lutheran Church. ""Ebola is not going to shake our faith in any way ... because we've been through difficult times.""The World Health Organization (WHO) has said that the world's worst outbreak of Ebola will likely continue for months, as the region's healthcare systems struggle to cope, and it has appealed for funding and emergency medical staff.With the disease now in four African countries - following the death in Nigeria last month of a U.S. citizen who arrived from Liberia - the WHO on Friday classified the epidemic as an international health emergency.A WHO medical ethics committee is due to discuss next week the use of experimental drugs in tackling the outbreak after two U.S. aid workers appeared to show some improvement after being treated with ZMapp, a drug developed by California-based Mapp Biopharmaceutical.British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline said on Sunday a clinical trial of another experimental vaccine was due to start shortly. But even if it is fast-tracked, the new treatment would not be ready for deployment before next year.Spain on Sunday authorized the use of the ZMapp on 75-year-old Spanish priest Miguel Pajares - the first European infected - who was evacuated to Madrid last week after contracting the virus working in a hospital in Liberia. A Congolese nun who worked with him died on Saturday in Monrovia. Outside churches in the capital, plastic buckets with taps containing chlorinated water sat on stools, allowing worshippers to disinfect their hands. Inside, pastors told their congregations to follow instructions from health workers, some of whom have been attacked by locals terrified by the disease.""We are in trouble here. We are in trouble,"" Reverend Marcus MacKay, dressed in a green gown, said before the altar. ""But you know what? There is no way this devil is going to do its work!"" STARTED IN FORESTS OF GUINEAScientists believe that West Africa's first Ebola epidemic began in early December near Gueckedou in the remote forest region of southeastern Guinea, near the border with Liberia and Sierra Leone. Yet it is not clear how the virus jumped from central Africa, where it is regarded as endemic.National emergencies have since been declared in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Nigeria, which now has seven confirmed cases of Ebola. Guinea said on Saturday it was tightening health checks at border crossings.With healthcare workers unprepared to cope with the virus - which initially presents symptoms similar to malaria - many have died, exacerbating chronic staffing problems. Liberia alone has lost at least three doctors to the virus and 32 health workers.The coordinator of Medecins Sans Frontieres in Liberia, Lindis Hurum, has called the situation in the country ""catastrophic"". President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf on Saturday pledged up to $18 million to help protect workers, fund more ambulances and to increase the number of treatment centers.Burkina Faso became the latest African country on Sunday to announce stringent airport health checks and border controls to protect itself from infection. Zambia said on Saturday it would ban its citizens from traveling to countries hit by the virus.In Senegal, which borders Guinea to the north, a man had been isolated in the northern region of Matam while tests were conducted for Ebola, the APS state news agency reported.Tests on suspected cases in Hong Kong, Canada and Saudi Arabia in recent days have all proved negative.
