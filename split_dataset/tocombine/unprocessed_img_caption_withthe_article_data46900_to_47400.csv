Security Council resolutions, supported by China, that ban all ballistic missile-related activities by the North.Pyongyang rejects the ban as infringing its sovereign right to pursue a space program and self defense.Shortly after the missile launches, South Korean President Park Geun-hye and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met on the sidelines of the G20 summit and agreed to cooperate on monitoring the situation, a Japanese statement said.The South’s military said the missiles were medium-range Rodong-class, launched as a show of force timed to coincide with the G20 summit.In 2014, the North fired two Rodong medium-range missiles just as Park and Abe were meeting U.S. President Barack Obama at the Hague to discuss responding to the North’s arms program.The latest missiles were launched from a region called Hwangju and came just hours after the leaders of South Korea and China met on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Hangzhou, China.South Korea’s Park told Chinese President Xi Jinping that the North’s fourth nuclear test and its ballistic missile launches this year threatened regional peace and posed a challenge to SouthKorea’s ties with China, Yonhap news agency reported earlier.During the meeting, Xi reaffirmed China’s commitment to realizing the denuclearization of theKorean peninsula, China’s state news agency Xinhua reported on Monday.Xi also told Park that Beijing opposed the proposed deployment of a THAAD anti-missile system in South Korea, which Seoul and the United States have said is designed to counter an increasing missile threat from North Korea.Park said that a THAAD deployment would not threaten any other country’s security interests and would not be needed if the North’s nuclear issue was resolved, Yonhap news agency said.In July, the North launched three missiles in a single day from the western region that flew across the country and into the sea off its east coast, flying about 500 km and 600 km (300-360 miles).(Additional reporting by Nobuhiro Kubo in TOKYO; Writing by Jack Kim; Editing by Tony Munroe and Michael Perry)"

His gains have relied heavily on Russian air support since September last year.U.S. President Barack Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin had a longer-than-expected discussion of about 90 minutes on Monday about whether, and how, they could agree a deal, a senior U.S. administration official said.Meeting at the G20 summit in China, they discussed getting humanitarian aid into the country, reducing violence, and cooperating on combating militant groups, the official said.But in talks earlier on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov were unable to come to terms on a ceasefire for the second time in two weeks, with U.S. officials stressing they would walk away if a pact could not be reached soon.“If an agreement can be reached, we want to do so urgently, because of the humanitarian situation. However, we must ensure that it is an effective agreement,” the official said.Russia says it cannot agree to a deal unless opposition fighters, backed by the United States and Middle East allies, are separated from al Qaeda-linked militants they overlap with in some areas.For Washington, the priority is stabilizing Syria so as to destroy Islamic State, which controls territory both there and in neighboring Iraq.NATO Turkey ally on Sunday said rebels it was backing had gained control of all areas on its border that had been held by the jihadists, depriving the ultra-hardline Islamist group of its main route to the outside world.The announcement came some 10 days after Turkey launched its first major military incursion intoSyria since the start of the war in 2011, an operation aimed as much at preventing further Kurdish territorial gains as at driving back Islamic State.DOZENS KILLEDTwo of the explosions on Monday hit the Arzouna bridge area at the entrance to the Mediterranean city of Tartous, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and state news agency SANA said. Islamic State attacked Tartous in May.The Observatory and a city hospital put the death toll at 35, including members of the Syrian military, and said the number was likely to rise.Syrian state television said the first explosion was a car bomb and the second a suicide belt detonated as rescue workers arrived. The blasts hit during a summer festival at Tartous, whose beaches recently featured in a government tourism video.A car bomb meanwhile struck Homs, a city around 80 km (50 miles) east of Tartous which has repeatedly been hit by bombings claimed by Islamic State. State media said three people were killed, while the Observatory said the explosion hit an army checkpoint and four officers were killed.West of Damascus, there was an explosion near the town of al Saboura, killing one person and injuring three, according to a police commander quoted by state media.A motorbike also exploded in the centre of the northeastern city of Hasaka, which is controlled by the Kurdish YPG militia.The Observatory said the blast killed three members of a YPG-affiliated security force known as the Asayish, and injured others. It said a percussion bomb also went off in the province’s Qamishli city.The Kurdish YPG militia, a critical part of the U.S.-backed campaign against Islamic State, took almost complete control of Hasaka city in late August after a week of fighting with the government.Islamic State confirmed that a blast in Hasaka took place but did not say whether its fighters were involved.The YPG already controls swathes of northern Syria where Kurdish groups have established de facto autonomy since the start of the Syrian war in 2011, much to the alarm of neighboring Turkey.Ankara sees the YPG as an extension of Kurdish militants who have waged a three-decade insurgency in Turkey and fears the creation of a Kurdish enclave in northern Syria would fuel their separatist ambitions.(Additional reporting by Kinda Makieh in Damascus and Ahmed Tolba in Cairo, Lesley Wroughton in Washington; Writing by Nick Tattersall; Editing by Giles Elgood)"

3,MEDIA,Will Presidential Debate Moderators Really Not Challenge Lies?,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/debate-moderators-falsehoods_us_57cd8844e4b078581f138ec0,"Chris Wallace says it isn't his job to ""truth squad,"" though some journalists strongly disagree.",2016-09-05,"Fox News anchor Chris Wallace says he won't ""truth squad"" during the third presidential debate.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"NEW YORK ― When Donald Trump hits the debate stage in a few weeks with Hillary Clinton, it’s not hard to imagine the Republican nominee challenging his Democratic rival’s foreign policy judgment by falsely claiming ― as he’s done dozens of times ― to have been a staunch critic of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. He’s made the Iraq boast during Republican primary debates as a way to separate himself from his competitors ― despite being on the record as tepidly supporting the U.S. invasion ― and more recently wielded it while targeting Clinton, who voted for the disastrous war as a New York senator. If Trump were to do so again at the upcoming presidential debates, he just might get away with it. “Fox News Sunday” host Chris Wallace, the moderator for the third presidential debate, said in a Sunday interview that it isn’t his role to call out the candidates’ false claims.“That’s not my job,” Wallace told his Fox News colleague Howard Kurtz. “I do not believe that it’s my job to be a truth squad.”“No actually that is your job,” Peter Hamby, Snapchat’s head of news and a former CNN political correspondent, responded on Twitter.Several other journalists and media commentators similarly took issue with Wallace’s view that the candidates themselves ― and not the moderator ― should challenge one another’s claims on factual grounds.Presidential debates should be about the candidates rhetorically duking it out onstage, with minimal interference from the television news anchor steering the proceedings. Moderators would be wise to pause before disrupting a spirited back-and-forth to make an insignificant point or weigh in decisively on an issue that isn’t black and white. But moderators, like Wallace, play a critical vetting role each election cycle by formulating questions in order to challenge the candidates in front of tens of millions of people. They should also feel empowered to say if a candidate is repeating a claim that’s been widely debunked by credible journalists and fact-checking operations. By not adjudicating, the moderator leaves the viewing public with a “he said, she said” situation when the journalist picked to be onstage could say, decisively, who is right. It’s understandable why moderators would hesitate to throw themselves in the mix. The five moderators selected Friday by the Commission on Presidential Debates surely don’t want their performances to become highly partisan post-debate controversies ― as was the case last election cycle. Former CNN anchor Candy Crowley came under fire for interjecting during a 2012 debate between President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney over whether the president had called the Sept. 11, 2012, Benghazi attack an “act of terror” the day after in the Rose Garden. Obama called for checking the transcript during the debate and Crowley said that the president had indeed used the words “act of terror” in his Sept. 12 address.Obama’s “act of terror” line could understandably be interpreted as a reference to Benghazi, though critics argued that the president wasn’t clear in his Rose Garden remarks. They also suggested Romney was correct on his broader point that the White House was slow to strongly condemn the events in Libya as a terrorist attack, an argument that got lost amid the much-discussed three-person debate exchange. Wallace’s fellow moderators haven’t yet weighed in on the issue of real-time fact-checking. “NBC Nightly News” anchor Lester Holt, who will moderate the first debate on Sept. 26 at Hofstra University, was unavailable Monday for comment, according to a network spokeswoman. ABC News’ chief global affairs correspondent Martha Raddatz, who moderated a 2012 vice presidential debate and will co-moderate the Oct. 9 presidential town hall debate with CNN’s Anderson Cooper, declined to comment through a spokeswoman. A CNN spokeswoman did not immediately respond for comment regarding Cooper’s view.  Elaine Quijano, the CBS News correspondent and digital anchor who will moderate the Oct. 4 vice presidential debate, also declined to comment through a spokeswoman. Glenn Kessler, who writes the Washington Post’s “Fact Checker” column and has tracked candidate statements (and misstatements) closer than most journalists this election cycle, seems to side more with Wallace’s view of the job. He prefers the candidates fact-checking each other, with the moderator playing a limited role. “I think that voters are more interested in hearing what the candidates have to say, and not in real time fact checking of those comments,” Kessler said in an email. “The moderator should simply get out of the way, except for follow ups that pin down or clarify what a candidate is saying. That could include a fact check, but it’s a delicate balance.”Kessler said that “the moderator has to be absolutely sure they are correct” when fact-checking, and that he didn’t think Crowley was right to do so during the second 2012 presidential debate. He suggested moderators could incorporate fact-checks in how they frame questions, as Wallace did during a Republican primary debate with information from one of his columns. “Moderators could use fact checks as a way to get into questions of substance,” he wrote. “[For example]: ‘Mr. Trump, you have criticized Clinton for voting to authorize the war in Iraq. While you claim you opposed it, fact checkers have found no evidence of any public statements against it ―and in fact they have found evidence you also supported it. Clinton has apologized for her vote, saying it was a mistake. Will you apologize for trying to mislead the American public about your stance on the war?’”Politicians, of all parties, have been known to exaggerate, misstate and even lie. But fact-checking has felt more vital during the 2016 election cycle given the frequency and volume of Trump’s false claims and how quickly they spread online and on social media. Fact-checkers have dinged Clinton, too, but have catalogued significantly fewer major offenses. Trump has gone as far as lying about having witnessed events that never happened. In addition, the former ― and current? ― birther has amplified crackpot conspiracy theories and promoted bogus, race-baiting statistics to his millions of social media followers. News organizations have tried keeping up with Trump’s persistent untruths. In March, Politico found Trump having made “more than five dozen statements deemed mischaracterizations, exaggerations, or simply false” over the course of a week. Later that month, The Huffington Post caught Trump making 71 separate claims that were “inaccurate, misleading or deeply questionable” during a single CNN town hall. And when the New Yorker launched a new fact-checking feature last week, editor David Remnick wrote that “in the scale and in the depth of his lying, Donald Trump is in another category.”"

Bush,"Marjorie Cohn, ContributorProfessor Emerita at Thomas Jefferson School of Law",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iraqi-woman-uses-chilcot-report-in-war-crimes-lawsuit_us_57cd7c38e4b07addc4138b20,"Sundus Saleh, an Iraqi woman, first filed her lawsuit against George W.

Bush listens to a speech while visiting Warren Easton Charter High School one day before the ten year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, Louisiana, August 28, 2015.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57cee396180000b12fbcf830.jpeg?cache=qaJytQJh8B&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Sundus Saleh, an Iraqi woman, first filed her lawsuit against George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Donald Rumsfeld, Condoleezza Rice and Paul Wolfowitz in September 2013. Alleging that the Iraq War constituted an illegal crime of aggression, Saleh filed the suit on behalf of herself and other Iraqis in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.The district court dismissed Saleh’s lawsuit in December 2014, saying the defendants acted within the scope of their employment when they planned and carried out the Iraq War. Saleh then appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.In her appeal, Saleh is arguing that the Bush officials were acting from personally held convictions that the U.S. should invade Iraq, regardless of any legitimate policy reasons, and that they knowingly lied to the public when they fraudulently tied Saddam Hussein to al-Qaeda and the threat of weapons of mass destruction.Inder Comar, Saleh’s lawyer, explained, “Nuremberg held that domestic immunity was not a defense to allegations of international aggression. Everything the Germans did was legal under the law. We are asking the Ninth Circuit to reject the application of domestic immunity in this case, in line with the holdings of Nuremberg.”On July 22, Saleh urged the Ninth Circuit to take judicial notice of portions of the Chilcot Report, which makes factual conclusions about the run-up to the Iraq War. A court can take judicial notice of a fact that is not subject to reasonable dispute and can be accurately and readily determined from sources whose accuracy cannot be reasonably questioned. That includes public records, such as reports issued by a commission of inquiry.The report was published by the Iraq Inquiry Committee, an independent committee established by the British government, on July 6, 2016, after six years of investigation, research and drafting.Here are four of the excerpts from the report that Saleh has submitted to the court for judicial notice: 24. President Bush decided at the end of 2001 to pursue a policy of regime change in Iraq. 68. On 26 February, 2002, Sir Richard Dearlove, the Chief of the Secret Intelligence Service, advised that the U.S. Administration had concluded that containment would not work, was drawing up plans for a military campaign later in the year, and was considering presenting Saddam Hussein with an ultimatum for the return of inspectors while setting the bar “so high that Saddam Hussein would be unable to comply.” 74. Mr. [UK Foreign Secretary Jack] Straw’s advice of 25 March proposed that the U.S. and UK should seek an ultimatum to Saddam Hussein to re-admit weapons inspectors. That would provide a route for the UK to align itself with the U.S. without adopting the U.S. objective regime change. This reflected advice that regime change would be unlawful. 89. Sir Richard Dearlove reported that he had been told that the US had already taken a decision on action - “the question was only how and when;” and that he had been told it intended to set the threshold on weapons inspections so high that Iraq would not be able to hold up U.S. policy. The report includes copies of notes between Bush and former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, in which they discussed the invasion of Iraq as early as October 2001.Eight months before the invasion of Iraq, Blair wrote to Bush, saying “I will be with you, whatever.” In July 2002, Blair had told Bush that removing Hussein from power would “free up the region” even though Iraqis might “feel ambivalent about being invaded.”The report concluded that Hussein posed no imminent threat on March 20, 2003, the date the US and the UK invaded Iraq. It also noted that a majority of the United Nations Security Council favored continuing UN monitoring and inspections.Legal Experts Conclude War was IllegalThe committee also published submissions by legal experts who concluded the war was illegal and constituted aggression against Iraq.Philippe Sands said, “Distinguished members of the legal community in the United Kingdom have also concluded without ambiguity that the war was unlawful.”Sir Michael Wood stated, “the use of force against Iraq in March 2003 was contrary to international law,” in that it “had not been authorized by the Security Council, and had no other legal basis in international law.”Elizabeth Wilmshurst concurred, noting, “the facts did not justify the use of force in self-defence. Existing Security Council resolutions did not authorize the use of force. There was no other legal justification. A desire to change the regime did not give a legal basis for military action,” adding, “I regarded the invasion of Iraq as illegal.”An international group of lawyers (including former US Attorney General Ramsey Clark and I) filed an amicus brief supporting Saleh’s legal claims. Clark told Truthout at the time, “In this case, as many as 3.5 million people have lost their lives as a consequence of the crime of aggression ― the illegal use of force perpetrated against the people of Iraq ― and the country’s development has been set back countless years.”Allegations Against Team BushThe UN Charter, which was created by the countries of the world in 1945 to “save succeeding generations from the scourge of war,” prohibits the use of military force except in self-defense or with Security Council approval. Neither of these two conditions was present before the U.S.-UK invasion of Iraq. Iraq did not pose an imminent military threat to any UN member country on March 19, 2003, and the Security Council did not approve the invasion.A “crime against peace” is defined by the Nuremberg Charter as “planning, preparation, initiation or waging a war of aggression, or a war in violation of international treaties, agreements or assurances, or participation in a common plan or conspiracy for the accomplishment of any of the foregoing.” The U.S.-UK war against Iraq was a war of aggression.The International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg held, “To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole.”In his opening statement as chief US prosecutor at Nuremberg, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Robert Jackson said, “No political, military, economic, or other considerations shall serve as an excuse or justification” for a war of aggression. He added, “If certain acts in violation of treaties are crimes, they are crimes whether the United States does them or whether Germany does them.”Saleh’s complaint cites statements made by the defendants as early as 1998 which indicate their intention to change Iraq’s regime. For example, in his testimony before the House National Security Committee on Iraq, Wolfowitz advocated the removal of Hussein and the formation of a provisional government that would “control the largest oil field in Iraq.”On September 12, 2001, Rumsfeld complained that there were no decent targets for bombing Afghanistan so the United States should consider bombing Iraq, which had better targets. Bush said at the time that the U.S. should change Iraq’s government.In July 2002, Dearlove, reporting on recent meetings in the U.S., said, “the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.”Bush, Cheney and Rice used faulty intelligence in order to better market a war with Iraq to the American people.The defendants engaged in a pattern and practice of deceiving the American public into believing that a link between al-Qaeda and Iraq existed in order to win approval for the crime of aggression against Iraq.On September 14, 2004, UN Secretary General Kofi Annan stated, “I have indicated that [the invasion of Iraq] was not in conformity with the UN Charter. From our point of view and from the Charter’s point of view it was illegal.”Justice Jackson called the crime of aggression “the greatest menace of our times.” More than 70 years later, his words continue to ring true.“The invasion [of Iraq] resulted in the total destruction of a beautiful, peaceful country,” Saleh told Truthout in 2015. “The invasion didn’t destroy only the country’s infrastructure, buildings and heritage; it destroyed millions of families and their dreams.”Marjorie Cohn is professor emerita at Thomas Jefferson School of Law, former president of the National Lawyers Guild, and a member of the advisory board of Veterans for Peace.

7,POLITICS,The ‘Father Of Biodiversity’ Fears Trump And Nuclear War More Than Climate Change,Chris D'Angelo,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/eo-wilson-fears-trump-nuclear-war_us_57ca5511e4b0e60d31df4634,Famed conservationist E.O. Wilson says climate change is a threat. But he also worries about the Republican nominee and people with nuclear codes.,2016-09-05,"Retired Harvard University professor E.O. Wilson, right, sat down with The Huffington Post and Hawaii partner Honolulu Civil Beat during the world's largest conservation event. Here he is pictured after speaking at the event's opening forum.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57cef79b180000b12fbcf88c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Former Harvard biology professor E.O. Wilson is one of the most respected and revered conservationists alive today.So you might find it curious that his biggest fear isn’t climate change or the ongoing mass extinction that destroys an estimated 150-200 species every day.Nope. It’s Donald Trump.“My main worry right now is that the Republican candidate might win the election,” Wilson said in an interview with The Huffington Post and its Hawaii partner Honolulu Civil Beat at the International Union for Conservation of Nature’s World Conservation Congress in Honolulu.The congress, which is being held in the U.S. for the first time in IUCN’s 68-year history, is the world’s largest environmental and nature conservation event and is often referred to as the Olympics of conservation. This year’s event drew more than 9,000 delegates from 190 nations.Many in the environmental community would place Wilson in the same pantheon as John Muir, Aldo Leopold and Henry David Thoreau.Wilson has won two Pulitzer Prizes for his insights into nature and how it influences the human condition. The 87-year-old is commonly referred to as the “Father of Biodiversity” for his dogged determination to protect plant and animal species and preserve the overall health of the planet.In the interview, Wilson dismissed the notion of a Trump presidency with a chuckle, predicting the businessman won’t prove victorious over Hillary Clinton in November.For that reason, he offered a second “greatest fear.”“My main worry is nuclear war, as it should be for everybody,” Wilson said, adding it could come as a result of “some stupid mistake.”“If we had a conflict with nuclear weapons use it would be horribly damaging,” he stressed. “So my main concern — notice I bounced away from biological diversity, because I am concerned about the human species too — would be nuclear war.”Nukes aside, Wilson said climate change is the biggest environmental challenge facing the globe. Second to that is the loss of plant and animal species to extinction, which he said makes the globe less stable and is a “terrible, needless destruction of our most sanctioned heritage.”The scientific community has overwhelmingly accepted the realities of climate change, including the role human beings have played in driving global temperatures.Still, many, including a large percent of Republican politicians, continue to deny its existence. Wilson said he thinks that denial is not a result of ignorance but “willful opposition” by people who would be negatively impacted, either financially or politically, by efforts to stop climate change.Wilson now advocates for setting aside half the Earth’s surface for nature so that it can remain undisturbed by humans. It was the subject of his latest book, Half-Earth, and his address to the IUCN World Conservation Congress.Although the world faces many threats, Wilson wasn’t all doom and gloom. There’s been a shift in public awareness, which he said gives him great hope for the future.“We’re going green,” he said. “It’s pastel green, but it’s still green.”Nick Grube of Honolulu Civil Beat contributed to this report.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."
8,POLITICS,Enjoy Your Day Off For Labor Day (Unless You're A Low-Wage Worker),Dave Jamieson,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/labor-day-low-wage-worker_us_57c9e949e4b0e60d31df376f,The working poor are still the least likely to get paid holidays off.,2016-09-05,A quarter of private-sector workers don't have paid holidays.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57c9eabf170000012ac77514.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Labor Day is a time to celebrate the U.S. labor movement and all its hard-won victories ― including holidays, like Labor Day itself. And yet nearly one in four workers won’t be enjoying the day off with pay on Monday.Twenty-three percent of private-sector workers in the U.S. don’t get paid holidays off from their jobs, according to the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s roughly the same amount of workers who don’t get any paid vacation time.Although most of the U.S. workforce does get paid holidays off, it’s low-wage workers who are the most likely not to. Among those in the lowest-earning quartile of workers, a little over half do not get any paid holidays. By contrast, more than 9 out of 10 workers in the highest-earning quartile do get paid holidays. In other words, the less you’re paid to begin with, the less likely you are to spend Labor Day with your family without sacrificing a day’s pay. Just as you would be vastly less likely to be able to stay home from work while sick. Only 39 percent of workers in the bottom quartile get paid sick days, compared to 84 percent of workers in the highest. As far as paid holidays go, the most recent survey shows a slight improvement over the previous year. When The Huffington Post reported on the data last year, 48 percent of workers in the lowest-paid quartile had said they got paid while not working on holidays, compared with 52 percent this year. Among the highest earners, the rates went unchanged.Not surprisingly, the workers least likely to have paid holidays are those who are employed in the service industry or work part-time. The U.S. has 10 official federal holidays on the calendar ― all days on which the federal government is generally closed and federal workers stay at home. But unlike most other developed countries, the U.S. does not mandate that private-sector workers get to enjoy paid holidays. According to an analysis by the Center for Economic Policy and Research, most nations that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development guarantee at least six paid holidays for workers. Those without such a mandate still manage to guarantee paid vacation time. The U.S., however, doesn’t guarantee either.Some liberals in Congress would like to change that. Rep. Alan Grayson (D-Fla.) has sponsored legislation that would require employers to give their workers at least some paid vacation time, a concept strongly opposed by business groups and most Republican lawmakers. Grayson has pitched the idea as basic economic fairness. “Overwhelmingly, it’s the low-income workers who don’t get the paid vacation,” he previously told HuffPost.Although the idea of a paid vacation or holiday mandate hasn’t caught on, more and more Americans like the idea of guaranteeing workers sick days. Four states ― California, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Oregon ― have laws on the books that make sure workers can accrue paid sick days through their jobs, as do a growing number of liberal cities. And although paid sick day legislation has stalled in Congress, President Barack Obama recently signed an executive order requiring federal contractors to give their workers some amount of sick leave.

9,TRAVEL,Slavic Cool?,"Rudy Koshar, ContributorProfessor of History, University of Wisconsin-Madison",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/slavic-cool_us_57cd6492e4b0b9c5b73986c7,"“Slavic cool” is everywhere these days. As Seth Sherwood writes in a recent New York Times travel article, it is especially",2016-09-05,"Bridge of the Slovak National Uprising, commonly referred to as the UFO Bridge, Bratislava, constructed 1967-72. A significant part of the Old Town, including most of the Jewish quarter, was demolished to make way for the road leading to the bridge.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57cd8027170000062ac779f8.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"“Slavic cool” is everywhere these days. As Seth Sherwood writes in a recent New York Times travel article, it is especially evident in Belgrade, former capital of Communist Yugoslavia and today a burgeoning economic and cultural hub of the Balkan revival. The fourth-century city features many stunning cultural attractions. From Kalmegadan Park, the historic center, to the still unfinished St. Sava cathedral, Belgrade shimmers in a post-Communist, post-civil-war dawn. Yet on a recent trip to the Balkans including not only Belgrade but also other Balkan cities, I felt a broader range of temperatures, many chillier than expected.Belgrade is situated on the confluence of the Sava and Danube rivers. On the Sava, there are dozens of party barges, where youth from all over Europe dance the night away to the pounding rhythms of disco and techno music. Barge culture is a fitting symbol of Belgrade’s status as the Balkan party capital. But at the party barges one also meets the limits of Slavic cool. Hearing the barges from across the river late one night, I couldn’t help feeling they were a desperate attempt to flee the past and focus on the transient pleasures of the moment.For centuries, the Balkans were a crossroads in the unceasing battle of empires. Belgrade, Prague, Bratislava, and Sofia are etched with imperial desire. One sees historical traces of Celtic, Roman, Byzantine, German, Austrian, Hungarian, Russian, and Ottoman ambition in the culture and architecture of these cities. Outside my hotel in Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, the parking lot was sliced in half because Roman ruins from Constantine’s time had been discovered only a few yards from the hotel entrance. The archeological dig going on below my window reminded me that the Balkans are a vast palimpsest of human accomplishment and suffering.In Belgrade, we had a skillful guide (call him Anton), a Serbian in his late thirties. Anton was enthusiastic about Belgrade’s opportunity to escape its many pasts. He recognized contemporary Serbia’s economic problems, above all its loss of educated young people to Austria, Germany, and beyond. But he also thought that post-Communist and post-Milosevic Serbia was a markedly more humane and freer society. He had a sharp and ironic sense of humor, a signature of Slavic cool. He had wonderful jokes about the Yugo, the Communist-era car designed to bring motoring to the working masses. (What do we call a Yugo at the top of a hill? A miracle. What do we call two Yugos at the top of a hill? A mirage.)Yet Anton also referred frequently to arguments he’d had with his parents, who remain loyal to the memory of Tito. The Yugoslav dictator was widely popular across the region in World War II, when he led heroic resistance to Nazi occupation. He ruled postwar Yugoslavia with a mix of material incentive and brutality. He was a bon vivant who enjoyed dining not only with heads of state but also writers, filmmakers, and actresses like Gina Lollobrigida and Sophia Lauren. In Belgrade bookstores one can find Tito’s Cookbook, which features recipes from some of the more memorable dinners the dictator hosted. When he died in 1980, the ethnic and political tensions he had skillfully balanced erupted into a civil war that left dreams of unity between Slovenes, Croats, Bosnians, and Serbs in ashes.Anton’s parents were attracted not only to Tito’s charisma but also the social and political security his version of Yugoslavia offered. In comparison, vaunted Western freedoms seem counterfeit to them. They see Serbian democracy and neo-liberal economic values as tools used by the rich and powerful to feather their own nests. In their eyes, Slavic cool is superficial, prone to brittleness, and inherently unjust.I saw other equivalents of this sense of betrayal. Anton’s optimism was countered by the pessimism of our guide in Sofia, Bulgaria’s capital. Daniela (also a pseudonym) is a few years older than Anton. She works as a teacher and supplements her salary by acting as a tour guide. Whereas the evidence of economic revival is obvious in Belgrade, it is detectable only with more effort in Sofia. Here poverty breaks through at every corner, whether in people’s shabbier clothing, crumbling building facades, or chaotic electrical wiring strung across house exteriors in the poorer districts.Daniela pulled no punches in her criticism of what she called (relying on the Canadian writer Naomi Klein) the “shock therapy” of neo-liberal economics. Low salaries, increasing economic disparities, corruption at the highest levels—these are the manifestations of Western-style freedom in her country. As we toured Sofia’s historical treasures, Daniela reminded us that the Brave New Western World of the East was not brave but selfish, acquisitive, and insecure. Although she did not say it, in the new Bulgaria, as in the former East Germany, women’s plight is especially difficult thanks to the reduction or elimination of many social programs such as state-run childcare and paid maternity leave.So is Slavic cool as cool as many say? Is it even a reality? I left the Balkans with more questions than answers—and I turned up my collar as the wind grew harsher."

Nice try.

Clinton told a veterans group that U.S. leadership is vital to the world and, drawing a contrast with Republican Donald Trump, said that means the White House is no place for a leader who insults allies or threatens to shrink from that role. Photographer: Ty Wright/Bloomberg via Getty Images",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb829093c000018010dbfb3.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Don't count on a landslide.  As the presidential campaign enters the final stretch, two things are becoming clear. One is that Hillary Clinton is almost certain to win. Donald Trump suffers from sheer implausibility. It becomes more apparent every day that he is not qualified to be President by knowledge, experience or temperament. The other is that the election will be fairly close. Trump can win only if something unexpected happens. Like another financial crash. Or criminal charges against Hillary Clinton. Or a sensational terrorist attack (both Russian President Vladimir Putin and ISIS have indicated a preference for Trump). Democrats hoping for a landslide -- like 1964, when Lyndon Johnson beat Barry Goldwater by 23 points -- are likely to be disappointed. Hillary Clinton rarely breaks 50 percent in the polls. And the polls have been narrowing as her convention bounce has faded. As of Labor Day, she had a four-point lead in the RealClearPolitics polling average, 46 to 42 percent. Clinton is losing a lot of young voters for whom she has never had much appeal. She lost young voters big time to Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries. While young voters don't trust Clinton, they are strongly opposed to Trump. Right now, third-party candidates are pulling about a quarter of the youth vote. Sooner or later many young voters will realize that by voting for a third-party candidate, they are helping Trump. They need to be reminded of how Green candidate Ralph Nader elected George W. Bush in Florida in 2000. There are other reasons why the outcome is likely to be close. It's an open race. There's no incumbent President or Vice President on the ballot. That's only happened twice since 1950 (1952 and 2008). The relevant incumbent this year is President Obama, and his approval ratings are hovering at just over 50 percent. The increasing polarization of the electorate means that Republicans and Democrats will stick with their party. Polls show roughly 80 percent of partisans doing just that, with Independents closely divided. Then there's the ""time for a change'' factor. After a party has been in office for eight years, voters usually want change. The only exception since 1950 was in 1988, when voters elected George H.W. Bush because they wanted a third term for Ronald Reagan. Expect Republicans to repeat incessantly that a vote for Hillary Clinton is a vote for a third term for Obama.  Clinton has become the status quo candidate. She's linked to eight years of Barack Obama and, before that, eight years of Bill Clinton. The prevailing sentiment is, elect Clinton and nothing will change. That puts her in a marginally better position than Trump. Voters believe if they elect Trump, things will change for the worse.  Clinton's biggest problem is that she is a charter member of the political establishment. She's the elitist, while Trump is the complete populist. He speaks the language of the disgruntled white working class. He says ""notsupposedtas'' -- things his supporters believe but establishment politicians are ""not supposed to'' say. Like foreign trade is a rip-off and immigration is a threat and torture is O.K.  Trump's hostility to foreign trade and immigration and military intervention are pure populism. Hillary Clinton supports immigration reform. She favors foreign trade (though she has shifted her position on the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership and now opposes what she once called the ""gold standard'' of trade deals). She has a record of supporting military interventions. Pure elitism. Back in the 2008 Democratic primaries, Clinton was the populist. Obama was the elitist. Remember how he criticized economically disgruntled small-town voters who ""cling to guns or religion . . . or anti-immigrant or anti-trade sentiment''? Obama mocked Clinton as ""Annie Oakley'' because she boasted about how her father took her out behind the cottage her grandfather built in Pennsylvania and taught her how to shoot. Obama is still the elitist. He has always been the prince of education. Mitt Romney, his 2012 opponent, was the prince of wealth. They represented two bitterly competitive elites. Neither has a populist bone in his body. Obama's elitism gave us Donald Trump, the populist un-Obama.  Which leaves Hillary Clinton in the awkward position of defending Washington, the political establishment and the status quo. Her handling of government emails, her Wall Street payoffs and her hobnobbing with ultra-rich donors re-enforce the impression of privilege and elitism. It made her vulnerable to a surprisingly strong challenge from Bernie Sanders, an economic populist. And it's creating a alarming amount of support for Trump, a social populist who has scandalized the Republican establishment by embracing economic and foreign policy populism.  Bill Clinton tried his best to redefine his wife as the candidate of change. Speaking at the Democratic convention in July, he called Hillary Clinton ""the best darn change-maker I have ever met in my entire life.'' Nice try. But Trump will never concede the change issue, and Clinton is not in a good position to claim it. She will win, not because she represents change, but because the kinds of changes Trump is talking about are threatening to minority voters and scary to voters with an informed understanding of the issues. But it won't be an easy victory. Elitism is always a tough sell."
11,ENTERTAINMENT,"'São Jorge' Hits Venice: An Interview with Marco Martins, Nuno Lopes and Mariana Nunes","E.

But after a spellbinding two hours spent in the company of Martins' beautiful film, starring Nuno Lopes and Mariana Nunes, São Jorge will hereafter only be known as a masterpiece, to yours truly. A cinematic feast that, with little fanfare and a lot of heart, keeps the viewer glued to his or her chair for just under two hours.Filmed in gritty tones by DoP Carlos Lopes, around the parts of Lisbon that are definitely not on any tourist map, São Jorge tells a story of desperation and the heroism that arises when man is faced with a fight or flight situation. Jorge is an ex-boxer, a casualty of the European troika bailout measures imposed on his country. He has a Brazilian ex-wife, Susana, who wants little to do with him. Not because she doesn't love him or the spark is no longer there -- as we obviously realize halfway through the film -- but because she herself is making choices based on need, not want. Jorge and Susana have a child, Nelson, and to his father, the child is a form of salvation. So when Susana threatens to go back to Brazil and take Nelson with her, something snaps in Jorge, and his life takes a turn for the worse. Or does it?Beauty, they say, lies in the eyes of the beholder, and I believe the ending of a film can be gifted to its audience by a caring director. It was clear from the moment I met filmmaker Marco Martins that his respect for the audience is what makes his films so wonderfully haunting.I feel lucky to have caught up with him in Venice, where São Jorge premiered in the Orizzonti section of the La Biennale del Cinema, the Venice Film Festival. And to make my bounty even more plentiful, I also had the honor to speak with the sultry, kind Nuno Lopes and the stunning and intelligent Mariana Nunes.When I'm at a festival, forced to watch a lot of films, at some point I feel like I begin to blank out. Yet your film held me spellbound for the entire two hours. I wanted to know what would happen to Jorge, I took that journey with him, Susana, and their child. How do you make a film that appeals so much, with so little Hollywood flash?Marco Martins: When I thought about the movie and about the character Jorge, the first image that came to my mind was the first sequence of the film, where he's running away to get some money and he doesn't stop. And there I thought of the character of Jorge as a body, more than a mind. In a strange way, sometimes when I was writing he was like an action hero, because he's just actions, not thinking. The main characteristic of this character is that he's completely manipulated by all the surroundings and all the people around him. Not Susana, she's being sincere with him. When she says something it's not to manipulate him. He's very naive. Even the son, no, to some extent manipulates him?Martins: But the son is more of the conscience as a character. Mariana, how difficult was it to become this woman -- Susana?Mariana Nunes: A lot, because she lives in a very hard situation. She has no way to live, she has no more work, she has no hope. She had a husband, Jorge but they are not together and she is married with another man that she doesn't love. But she's trying, trying to stay alive. I didn't know about all these things that happened in Portugal, I'm from Basilia, and now I live in Rio, in Brazil. I know all this history because of them. And once I knew about the film, I started to go into the character, but not just the character -- the situation. And then I came to Lisbon to the rehearsals and stayed there for three months, living in Portugal. When I arrived things were better, but in the place where Susana lives things are not so good. People are very poor there. Jorge is of course the name of the main character but can you talk a bit about the meaning of Saint Jorge for the Portuguese?Martins: Saint Jorge is an important saint for the city of Lisbon, and he's a warrior -- São Jorge. When I thought about the title of the film and the character, initially I didn't think about São Jorge, I just call him Jorge. One day, I live in the center of Lisbon near the castle of Sao Jorge, and I was coming home, and I asked myself who is Sao Jorge? You live there of course you never research it, so then I researched it and found out he was a warrior, and the prayer of Saint George was a great metaphor for the film. So it became very evident this was the name. You know, also boxers always have some kind of superstition. With this guy, I liked the fact that he had some spiritual thing, that takes him away from the environment where he lives because those around him are not very spiritual. They are very attached to money.When you're from a middle class upbringing it's easy to say ""they're always talking about money"" but when you don't have any, and you struggle to live day by day, it's all you talk about! Martins: And also rich people talk a lot about money. When money becomes an issue, a real important issue in your life, you talk a lot about it. I think if you have a job and a stable life you don't talk about it too much, because you have the same amount of money, month after month.It's good you talked about money, because there is a certain violence and it's very aggressive when you show money in a film. Americans do that a lot, they have guns and they have money in films. Suitcase of money, people exchanging money. For us, I never thought of showing money in films but then I thought I want to make a movie where I show money. Not guns. But there's money, and it's one of the main subjects in the film. I look at your today, Nuno and you're as different as can be from Jorge: your hair has grown back, you sport a beautiful smile, and you're a lot slimmer... How do you connect to such a character, to his silence and all that?Nuno Lopes: We did all the research from the beginning together [with Martins] and I spent a lot of time training for the boxing. I started working with the boxers two years before we shot and in the last six months trained six hours a day. Then I spent a lot of time with the people in the neighborhood and when you spend a lot of time with people there is something that stays with you, and your subconscious. Like if you stay in a town with a strong accent, if you're open to it, after three or four months you start talking like that. So I spent a lot of time with them, trying to absorb those kinds of things and get into the language which is very different from mine. And the conditions and the thoughts... And I think something came from that and the rest was just thinking about the material, the script and what we wanted to talk about. That drove me through the character. We did it together from the beginning so it's the first film I did where I don't feel there was a moment when I started acting. The acting was just the part of the construction of the film. When you first read the script Mariana, what made you connect with Susana?Nunes: Many things, first of all because she's Brazilian like me, she is a black woman, and I've lived in Europe, in Madrid and know how is the racism there. Brazil is a very racist but it's different here, because people are less mixed, things are more separated. And I had a mother-in-law that thought things very similar to Jorge's father. I understand what Susana lives.Marco, there is no real violence in the film, and yet it was described in the synopsis as Jorge being dragged into a life of crime. This was your choice and I think that's what kept me watching until the end, knowing that the violence wasn't going to make me jump out of my seat. How do you write a script like this?Martins: When I write a script I don't want to have a moral judgement about the characters. I want to like every character, I cannot write a character that I don't like. If I do that, I'm making a moral judgement, I'm judging instead of the viewer. The moral decisions have to be made by the audience. The director shows the subject and he manipulates it a lot, but the moral questions have to be important, and be open. And I like characters that until the end you keep guessing what they are going to do. Jorge never explains himself. To anyone. Someone said that a good script is when someone is reading it, and they think they know what is going to happen next and they find out it's different, slightly changed. Not making the obvious decision makes the script more erotic in a way. Marco, when did you know you had to have them both, Mariana and Nuno, in your film?Martins: With Nuno, we started working together from the beginning, and we did work a lot of times in the last years in theater, in previous films, so I knew. With Mariana, I didn't know her but I was looking for a black Brazilian actress and a good friend of mine, Brazilian, told me I had to look at Mariana. I was like, I'll see her. Then we went to Brazil, me and Nuno and we cast for a while and then I think that they were perfect together. Their chemistry is perfect. And that's very important. Even in the festival photo shoot, here, they are still the perfect couple. If you look at them in the movie, you believe immediately that they are a couple. Was there a particular scene, Marco that you had to cut, and which you wish was still there?Martins: Since it was very documentary-style as well, a mix of fiction and documentary, we shot a lot of things that are not in the movie. The film could easily have half an hour more. But that's the secret of a great filmmaker, that he can cut a piece of his child for the sake of his audience not getting bored.Martins: That's true, when I'm in the editing room, I always respect the viewer. I try to be a viewer. It's the ideal artist, to be both the viewer and the creator, that's impossible but it's what you always try to do.I think a lot of filmmakers don't think like that. You find there are always those ten minutes that they could have left on the editing floor, and the film would have been better. Martins: Even now if I see it, I think it could have been a little less. The editing for me is always a long process, I edited this film for six months.A film like yours is one that allows for a conversation to make the world a better place. Do you all think cinema is a way for us to understand and change the world? Nunes: Maybe. Maybe it can work. I don't know. I think São Jorge is very universal because the situation is in Portugal but it's not only there. In Brazil people will connect with the movie, and in other places maybe. Martins: Some subjects it's impossible for them to be well explained in the news, because we don't have the time or the space, or the media doesn't care for it. Sometimes fiction is very important, it's something that people forget. I could not make a documentary about this subject, you have to make a fiction -- a fiction about an impossible documentary. Lopes: It's definitely a way to change, but it depends on the viewer, actually. We just put questions and give space to thought, but then it's for the viewer to think about it. That part we cannot change. Martins: The fact that people sit in a movie theater for two hours, it's a lot in today's world. People just see news on their phone, or they heard about the crisis but there are no faces of the crisis, just numbers. If they sit two hours, they have to think about it for two hours...Lopes: That's why I love this kind of political films, that in a way are not consensual, because when you leave and think, ""I agree with them all the time,"" you go home and you sleep very well and never think about it again. But if it confronts you with another vision, hopefully it will make you think about it. I think the way of changing something is to not make the audience agree with you.Images courtesy of La Biennale, used with permission."

A cinematic feast that, with little fanfare and a lot of heart, keeps the viewer glued to his or her chair for just under two hours.Filmed in gritty tones by DoP Carlos Lopes, around the parts of Lisbon that are definitely not on any tourist map, São Jorge tells a story of desperation and the heroism that arises when man is faced with a fight or flight situation. Jorge is an ex-boxer, a casualty of the European troika bailout measures imposed on his country. He has a Brazilian ex-wife, Susana, who wants little to do with him. Not because she doesn't love him or the spark is no longer there -- as we obviously realize halfway through the film -- but because she herself is making choices based on need, not want. Jorge and Susana have a child, Nelson, and to his father, the child is a form of salvation. So when Susana threatens to go back to Brazil and take Nelson with her, something snaps in Jorge, and his life takes a turn for the worse. Or does it?Beauty, they say, lies in the eyes of the beholder, and I believe the ending of a film can be gifted to its audience by a caring director. It was clear from the moment I met filmmaker Marco Martins that his respect for the audience is what makes his films so wonderfully haunting.I feel lucky to have caught up with him in Venice, where São Jorge premiered in the Orizzonti section of the La Biennale del Cinema, the Venice Film Festival. And to make my bounty even more plentiful, I also had the honor to speak with the sultry, kind Nuno Lopes and the stunning and intelligent Mariana Nunes.When I'm at a festival, forced to watch a lot of films, at some point I feel like I begin to blank out. Yet your film held me spellbound for the entire two hours. I wanted to know what would happen to Jorge, I took that journey with him, Susana, and their child. How do you make a film that appeals so much, with so little Hollywood flash?Marco Martins: When I thought about the movie and about the character Jorge, the first image that came to my mind was the first sequence of the film, where he's running away to get some money and he doesn't stop. And there I thought of the character of Jorge as a body, more than a mind. In a strange way, sometimes when I was writing he was like an action hero, because he's just actions, not thinking. The main characteristic of this character is that he's completely manipulated by all the surroundings and all the people around him. Not Susana, she's being sincere with him. When she says something it's not to manipulate him. He's very naive. Even the son, no, to some extent manipulates him?Martins: But the son is more of the conscience as a character. Mariana, how difficult was it to become this woman -- Susana?Mariana Nunes: A lot, because she lives in a very hard situation. She has no way to live, she has no more work, she has no hope. She had a husband, Jorge but they are not together and she is married with another man that she doesn't love. But she's trying, trying to stay alive. I didn't know about all these things that happened in Portugal, I'm from Basilia, and now I live in Rio, in Brazil. I know all this history because of them. And once I knew about the film, I started to go into the character, but not just the character -- the situation. And then I came to Lisbon to the rehearsals and stayed there for three months, living in Portugal. When I arrived things were better, but in the place where Susana lives things are not so good. People are very poor there. Jorge is of course the name of the main character but can you talk a bit about the meaning of Saint Jorge for the Portuguese?Martins: Saint Jorge is an important saint for the city of Lisbon, and he's a warrior -- São Jorge. When I thought about the title of the film and the character, initially I didn't think about São Jorge, I just call him Jorge. One day, I live in the center of Lisbon near the castle of Sao Jorge, and I was coming home, and I asked myself who is Sao Jorge? You live there of course you never research it, so then I researched it and found out he was a warrior, and the prayer of Saint George was a great metaphor for the film. So it became very evident this was the name. You know, also boxers always have some kind of superstition. With this guy, I liked the fact that he had some spiritual thing, that takes him away from the environment where he lives because those around him are not very spiritual. They are very attached to money.When you're from a middle class upbringing it's easy to say ""they're always talking about money"" but when you don't have any, and you struggle to live day by day, it's all you talk about! Martins: And also rich people talk a lot about money. When money becomes an issue, a real important issue in your life, you talk a lot about it. I think if you have a job and a stable life you don't talk about it too much, because you have the same amount of money, month after month.It's good you talked about money, because there is a certain violence and it's very aggressive when you show money in a film. Americans do that a lot, they have guns and they have money in films. Suitcase of money, people exchanging money. For us, I never thought of showing money in films but then I thought I want to make a movie where I show money. Not guns. But there's money, and it's one of the main subjects in the film. I look at your today, Nuno and you're as different as can be from Jorge: your hair has grown back, you sport a beautiful smile, and you're a lot slimmer... How do you connect to such a character, to his silence and all that?Nuno Lopes: We did all the research from the beginning together [with Martins] and I spent a lot of time training for the boxing. I started working with the boxers two years before we shot and in the last six months trained six hours a day. Then I spent a lot of time with the people in the neighborhood and when you spend a lot of time with people there is something that stays with you, and your subconscious. Like if you stay in a town with a strong accent, if you're open to it, after three or four months you start talking like that. So I spent a lot of time with them, trying to absorb those kinds of things and get into the language which is very different from mine. And the conditions and the thoughts... And I think something came from that and the rest was just thinking about the material, the script and what we wanted to talk about. That drove me through the character. We did it together from the beginning so it's the first film I did where I don't feel there was a moment when I started acting. The acting was just the part of the construction of the film. When you first read the script Mariana, what made you connect with Susana?Nunes: Many things, first of all because she's Brazilian like me, she is a black woman, and I've lived in Europe, in Madrid and know how is the racism there. Brazil is a very racist but it's different here, because people are less mixed, things are more separated. And I had a mother-in-law that thought things very similar to Jorge's father. I understand what Susana lives.Marco, there is no real violence in the film, and yet it was described in the synopsis as Jorge being dragged into a life of crime. This was your choice and I think that's what kept me watching until the end, knowing that the violence wasn't going to make me jump out of my seat. How do you write a script like this?Martins: When I write a script I don't want to have a moral judgement about the characters. I want to like every character, I cannot write a character that I don't like. If I do that, I'm making a moral judgement, I'm judging instead of the viewer. The moral decisions have to be made by the audience. The director shows the subject and he manipulates it a lot, but the moral questions have to be important, and be open. And I like characters that until the end you keep guessing what they are going to do. Jorge never explains himself. To anyone. Someone said that a good script is when someone is reading it, and they think they know what is going to happen next and they find out it's different, slightly changed. Not making the obvious decision makes the script more erotic in a way. Marco, when did you know you had to have them both, Mariana and Nuno, in your film?Martins: With Nuno, we started working together from the beginning, and we did work a lot of times in the last years in theater, in previous films, so I knew. With Mariana, I didn't know her but I was looking for a black Brazilian actress and a good friend of mine, Brazilian, told me I had to look at Mariana. I was like, I'll see her. Then we went to Brazil, me and Nuno and we cast for a while and then I think that they were perfect together. Their chemistry is perfect. And that's very important. Even in the festival photo shoot, here, they are still the perfect couple. If you look at them in the movie, you believe immediately that they are a couple. Was there a particular scene, Marco that you had to cut, and which you wish was still there?Martins: Since it was very documentary-style as well, a mix of fiction and documentary, we shot a lot of things that are not in the movie. The film could easily have half an hour more. But that's the secret of a great filmmaker, that he can cut a piece of his child for the sake of his audience not getting bored.Martins: That's true, when I'm in the editing room, I always respect the viewer. I try to be a viewer. It's the ideal artist, to be both the viewer and the creator, that's impossible but it's what you always try to do.I think a lot of filmmakers don't think like that. You find there are always those ten minutes that they could have left on the editing floor, and the film would have been better. Martins: Even now if I see it, I think it could have been a little less. The editing for me is always a long process, I edited this film for six months.A film like yours is one that allows for a conversation to make the world a better place. Do you all think cinema is a way for us to understand and change the world? Nunes: Maybe. Maybe it can work. I don't know. I think São Jorge is very universal because the situation is in Portugal but it's not only there. In Brazil people will connect with the movie, and in other places maybe. Martins: Some subjects it's impossible for them to be well explained in the news, because we don't have the time or the space, or the media doesn't care for it. Sometimes fiction is very important, it's something that people forget. I could not make a documentary about this subject, you have to make a fiction -- a fiction about an impossible documentary. Lopes: It's definitely a way to change, but it depends on the viewer, actually. We just put questions and give space to thought, but then it's for the viewer to think about it. That part we cannot change. Martins: The fact that people sit in a movie theater for two hours, it's a lot in today's world. People just see news on their phone, or they heard about the crisis but there are no faces of the crisis, just numbers. If they sit two hours, they have to think about it for two hours...Lopes: That's why I love this kind of political films, that in a way are not consensual, because when you leave and think, ""I agree with them all the time,"" you go home and you sleep very well and never think about it again. But if it confronts you with another vision, hopefully it will make you think about it. I think the way of changing something is to not make the audience agree with you.Images courtesy of La Biennale, used with permission."

But there couldn't be a higher-stakes election for American workers than this year's presidential election between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.On Labor Day, a day that honors working people and kicks off the final election sprint to November, we should talk about Trump's record on the issues that affect working families, because so much is at stake. Hardworking Americans deserve to know the truth about a man who might become president. We need the facts, not bluster, not attacks, not lies. It's a challenge to keep track of all the outrageous things Trump has said and done, but his business record speaks loud and clear about what kind of president he would be. Trump's companies have been cited 24 times for failing to pay minimum wage or overtime. At the Trump Taj Mahal casino, which went bankrupt twice, more than 250 subcontractors weren't paid in full or on time.A USA TODAY investigation found hundreds of people who say that Trump never paid them for their work, including construction workers and painters on Trump's Doral Miami project in Florida who weren't paid; dishwashers at a Trump resort in Palm Beach, Fla. who were denied time-and-a half for overtime hours; and wait staff, bartenders, and other hourly workers at Trump properties in California and New York who didn't receive tips customers earmarked for them or were refused break time. His record on working people's right to have a union and bargain a fair contract is just as bad. Trump says he ""100 percent"" supports right-to-work, which weakens workers' right to bargain a contract. Workers at his hotel in Vegas have been fired, threatened, and have seen their benefits slashed. He tells voters he opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- a very bad trade deal for working people - but still manufactures his clothing and product lines in Bangladesh, China, Mexico and other overseas locations. He says workers in state like Michigan are just going to have to accept lower wages if they want manufacturing jobs back. In contrast, Clinton has stood with working families and union families for decades. She walked the picket line with CWA members who were on strike at Verizon. She supports bargaining rights and the right to organize. She's worked to expand family and medical leave, close tax loopholes that benefit the 1 percent at the expense of our communities and secure health care and retirement benefits and equal pay. Clinton opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership both now and in a possible lame-duck session of Congress. She is the person that working families can believe in when looking for a candidate to advance their interests. There's no question that Donald Trump would be a disaster as president. If we want American employers to treat their employees well, we shouldn't vote for someone who stiffs workers. If we want American wages to go up, we shouldn't vote for someone who repeatedly violates minimum wage laws and says U.S. wages are too high. If we want jobs to stay in this country, we shouldn't vote for someone who manufactures products overseas. If we want women to be paid equally for their work, we shouldn't vote for someone who pays his male campaign staff one-third more than his female staff. If we want veterans to be treated with respect and dignity, we shouldn't vote for someone who insults a Gold Star family. If we want to move forward and not backward, there's just one choice. That's Hillary Clinton for president."

We were talking about the application process and possible essay topics. He mentioned the championship basketball game in which he missed the last shot and his team lost by a point. He was devastated.What did his parents think, I asked? ""They told me it was just a game,"" he responded.What could be more American? Playing basketball, losing the big game, and having your folks respond to teen angst with adult logic. Americans and Chinese are living a common human experience, despite all the obvious differences politically, historically, and culturally.In important ways China, still officially known as ""the People's Republic of China,"" is a grimmer place today than when I visited last year. President Xi Jinping, whose father suffered under Mao, is making others suffer today. A brutal and sustained crackdown is underway on academics, human rights activists, journalists, lawyers, and everyone else who dare stand for individual liberty. In a throwback to the Cultural Revolution which afflicted Xi pere, attorneys were recently dragged into court to publicly apologize for all sort of offenses against the state--because they previously defended people arrested for political ""crimes."" It was like the old Communist Party ""self-criticism"" sessions, with hapless victims sitting in dunce caps surrounded by Red Guards denouncing ""capitalist-roaders."" In fact, there is nervous talk of Xi as the new Mao, though some wonder if he might be in unexpected political danger having accumulated so many enemies.Yet for those who ignore politics life goes on largely unchanged. For instance, Chinese university students are patriots, but also thirst for knowledge. In July I joined a motley libertarian crew to speak on economics at a Chinese university. Out of respect for our hosts we eschewed topics that could cause undue controversy, but we had many spirited economics discussions. Ironically, the week-long ""summer camp"" was held in the school of Marxist economics. While not all the students were convinced by all our arguments--just like in America!--the majority recognized the importance of allowing private markets to work while protecting people's right to private property. They also were uniformly warm personally, irrespective of what they thought of U.S. government policies. These sessions give me hope for the future.Beijing is not China, a vast, diverse land with quadruple America's population but great poverty within. However, Beijing is one of China's great portals for the West, and illustrates how Western culture is more powerful in its own way than the American military. The PRC's capital is a sprawling metropolis, ever bigger and busier. It doesn't look like it tops a communist country. Indeed, one wonders what Mao Zedong would think if he arose from his massive mausoleum in Tiananmen Square and joined a tour group. Almost certainly he would be horrified, since the transformation demonstrates how malign his rule was. Freed of the bondage he imposed on them, the Chinese people have created a world class city.The urban core has a skyline. It's not as dramatic, even flamboyant, as that of Shanghai, the country's financial center. But Beijing is nothing like Washington, D.C., where no building rises higher than the Washington Monument.Politics is overpowering, especially in the area near Tiananmen Square, including Zhongnanhai, where the governing elite lives in secure seclusion. Nevertheless, there is little sign of communist ideology throughout most of Beijing. The city sports abundant history, culture, and, of course, commerce. Modern bank and other corporate buildings abound. The streets are filled with Western autos, often causing traffic jams of which Los Angeles would be proud. Advertising sells Western products.If you need something simple, visit a 7-11. But why stop there? In the capital of Chinese ""socialism"" private shops abound. Better (or worse, depending on your perspective), the city representing the triumph of the peasantry hosts the full range of luxury shops. Want designer goods or clothes, some fine jewelry, or that special car? No problem. A friend of mine drives a Mercedes. But that is commonplace. Drop by a trendy nightclub and you're likely to see the parking lot filled with autos few Americans can afford--Lamborghinis, Ferraris, and other vehicles suggesting a decidedly non-communist outlook.People dress Western. Forget Mao's faux peasant garb. (Maybe he thought looking like a commoner excused murdering tens of millions of them!) Designer wear helps define the elite. With the ongoing crackdown on corruption--at least, corruption among those on the political outs with President Xi--ostentation is more restrained, but hardly gone.However, most Chinese, like most Americans, don't live the high life. It was hot in July, though not as bad as in Washington, D.C., which I escaped for China. Shorts, ranging from athletic to Bermuda, were de rigueur, along with jeans and sweat pants. Footwear was a mix of running shoes, sandals, and flip-flops. T-shirts, many displaying English-language content, were common. Baseball caps dotted heads in a land where the American sport of choice is basketball.Business is conducted in a Western suit. Actually, this is one area where I'm disappointed that communism has proved to be a complete bust. What's wrong with a simple and light peasant outfit, especially sans tie? I've been wondering how I can start a Chinese movement that associates suits with counter-revolution.Once one imagined most Chinese being short. Nutrition matters: on average, South Koreans are a few inches taller than North Koreans. But as the widespread interest in basketball demonstrates, plenty of Chinese loom over the average American. It's still a little jarring to see a Chinese youth north of six feet, but ever more will venture out in the world.Just as tattoos have become common among younger Americans, you see them increasingly on Chinese as well. There's also graffiti, which I've always viewed as a form of urban tattoos. I have no idea what it says--perhaps ""We love Xi Jinping."" Still, I rather doubt it.If anything proves the dominance of American culture it is pervasive English labeling. I admire the English-speaking Chinese with whom I deal. It has to be as difficult to go from symbols to alphabet as the other way. I can tell the Chinese characters are different, but have no sense of the patterns or what to look for to distinguish one from another. But it's getting ever easier for an English speaker in Beijing and other big cities, at least. Signs proclaim ""24 hour bank,"" ""nail salon,"" ""stylish haircuts,"" and, of course, ""massage.""Another sign of globalization, or blight in the view of some, is the spread of U.S. fast food restaurants. Want McDonald's, Pizza Hut, or KFC? No problem. They aren't particularly cheap by Chinese standards. But for an adventurous Chinese citizen or Western visitor desperate for a taste of home, they satisfy.And while no self-respecting Chinese diner would be caught using Western utensils, most better restaurants have the latter for helpless visitors. Indeed, in many eateries the staff automatically brings a fork and knife to anyone with a Western face. I was proud to use chopsticks--quite competently, after so many visits to Asia, I hasten to add! But imagine the typical Washington restaurant keeping a stock of chopsticks for Chinese visitors. It ain't likely.Living in a country which has gone through such wrenching change (China was only just emerging from the horrific Cultural Revolution 40 years ago) may make people more receptive to innovation. Uber has been involved in a bitter battle to gain market share in the Chinese market. It announced a merger with a much larger domestic competitor while I was visiting Beijing, essentially surrendering. But many Chinese as well as foreign expats now are as comfortable ordering a car online as hailing a cab.The iPhone and its competitors have captured China as thoroughly as the rest of the world. Speaking to a university class leaves one looking out at kids getting online or texting friends. But it's hard to complain. If they come upon a difficult word while talking with you they whip out their phone and pull up a translation.Lots of Chinese youth hope to study in America. A small but increasing number are forgoing the grueling ""Gaokao,"" which determines which Chinese university they can attend, instead studying for the SAT or ACT, and English-proficiency TOEFL. An entire industry has sprung up to help kids prepare for and apply to U.S. colleges. A close friend works for one of the companies, UFEIC (University Foundation Education Instruction Center), and had me stop by to chat with some university-bound students. They also impressed me.Like their American counterparts, they are worried about jobs. While it's tough for university grads here to find something commensurate with their education, it's even harder in China. Speaking English, studying abroad, and understanding foreign cultures all give them a leg up. In general, Chinese students want to meet Americans, but not become Americans. They like Western-style liberties--I've yet to meet a Chinese kid who is happy that President Xi essentially decides what can be seen and said on the internet. But they love their people's history, believe in their country, and are rabid nationalists. Taiwan is part of China, and that's it. China owns everything in the South China Sea. No question. Even more so, wanting to go to the U.S. doesn't mean wanting Washington to boss their country around. Unsurprisingly, many feel pushed. Parental expectations are as great if not greater in China. The culture emphasizes filial piety, creating helicopter parents of the worst sort. On this trip one concerned mother dragged her high school daughter to lunch with me and my friend who works to help kids study abroad. Mom even insisted on accompanying us on a museum visit. It was strained all around, but she was determined to give her child every advantage, including, apparently, hanging out with a couple much older English-speakers from the West.Still, an increasing number say their folks' advice is to find what makes them happy. Moreover, with the end of the one-child policy I've started to see an occasional family with more than one kid. Overall fertility levels haven't changed much. But regaining this important aspect of human liberty--though more than two still is verboten--is a vital change. One of the strangest aspects of visiting China always has been the absence of families with multiple children. You never saw a mom struggling to both carry a baby and manage a toddler, or father with a couple tweens in tow. There was only one kid, which even Chinese acknowledged usually was treated like royalty by his or her parents and two sets of grandparents.Unfortunately, perhaps under U.S. encouragement China is picking up some of Washington's worst habits. No surprise, the PRC has its equivalent of the TSA. I've rarely found Chinese employees to be much different than their American counterparts. They unenthusiastically perform boring tasks which seem only vaguely related to protecting travelers from murderous hijackers.This time I ended up choosing the wrong line. The scanning machine operator was the anal sort who took twice as long as the fellow one line over in looking at everything--and flagged virtually every bag to be emptied, with both bag and contents sent back through the machine for a second go. The line barely inched along. Both my carry-ons were thus treated, leading to a double interrogation by another, English-challenged, security guy. As I was repacking my bags they closed the lane, as if it had been a set up just to punish me for snickering every time I saw an image of Mao. I departed damning TSA for forcing its standards on the rest of the world.It's always exciting to visit the PRC. But it is most interesting to learn about China, which is vastly larger, more complex, and humane than the nominal communist state which still rules. It's impossible to predict what China will ultimately become. Most important is that it becomes free, consigning today's authoritarian regime to history's dustbin. Then the people of China will be able to decide their own future. This article originally appeared in Forbes online."

Mind you, I usually don't watch boxing films and yet the stories of both these wondrous works of art drew me in without questions or hesitations.Of course, there was The Bleeder, which was carried by the star power heavyweight that is Liev Schreiber. In The Bleeder, calling his Chuck Wepner bigger than life would be an understatement.In São Jorge, which plays in the Orizzonti section in Venice, director Marco Martins portrays a quieter hero. Jorge is a man who is much more affected by the environment and social circumstances of the moment around him than by his own bad choices. Jorge is a lover, a father, an unemployed boxer who struggles to keep himself and those around him from drowning in the dire financial times of Portugal in the time of the European troika bailout measures. He wants desperately to provide, as great men do in his view, for those he loves but desperation is never an attractive -- nor productive quality. In fact, even when the broodingly handsome Jorge, played to quiet perfection by Nuno Lopes, tries to get his ex-wife Susana, played wonderfully by the real-life stunner Mariana Nunes, his desperate urgency is too much for her to bear, at first. I got to meet all three of the mega talents that make up São Jorge, and a full interview with Lopes, Martins and Nunes is upcoming. But in the meanwhile, let me just say that when their publicist enticed me by saying that they were all ""absolutely gorgeous"" he was right. The eyes want their part, this is the cinematic art after all, and although the austerity of the times in Portugal comes through in Carlos Lopes magnificently solemn cinematography, Sao Jorge is a film that kept me entranced and enthralled from frame one to the ending credits.While it was the visual aspect of São Jorge that drew me to watch it, with Keywan Karimi's Tabl (Drum) screening in the Critics' Week sidebar, what appealed to me was the controversy surrounding the filmmaker. Karimi has gone the way of so many beloved and respected filmmakers and intellectuals in Iran, symbolically gagged from speaking out and placed under house arrest. His crime? Discussing the un-discussible, talking about the un-talkable. In 2015, Karimi made a documentary called Writing on the City, about graffiti art in Tehran from the 1979 Islamic Revolution to Ahmadinejad's days. One would think that since those murals of rebellion -- as graffiti usually are -- were right there in open view, the filmmaker who simply captured them in a single cinematic essay would not have done anything wrong... But Karimi was accused of ""offending Islamic sacredness,"" and sentenced to varying degrees of imprisonment and 223 lashes. He's currently under house arrest but managed to get Tabl out by ""DHL, no issues, it was quite easy"" according to the film's producer François D'Artemare. D'Artemare has never met Karimi, but they ""Skype, WhatsApp, talk on the phone, it's a strange way to work with a director you've never met, but we have a kind of intimate relationship today,"" admitted the producer. Tabl is based on a book by Alimorad Fadaienia, an enigmatic Iranian intellectual who wrote the story in the 1960s at the time of the Shah's power. Today's Iran is quite different and yet this idea of a certain group of individuals who did things differently from the state's paid propagandists and the typical protesting intellectuals -- and thus shunned from both groups -- still rings true. That middle ground, the ""reasonables"" as I call them, they have always been the most attacked throughout history.The cinematography of Tabl is divine, shot with an elegance beyond its story in black & white, while the surround sound, everything from drums at a funeral to house invaders, and even a cat meowing, jumping out from some trash on the right of the screen is deeply entertaining and unusual.Most haunting perhaps were the empty chairs (see above, with D'Artemare) left in the Sala Perla of the Casinò, with Karimi's, Amirreza Naderi's, DoP Amin Jaferi's and co-editor Farahnaz Sharifi's names printed there, while D'Artemare gave a few choice interviews. It made me wonder, how much are we willing to sacrifice for our art, as human beings?Finally, it was the turn of an American cinematic legend, one that I've always felt closer to than say, Orson Welles or Clark Gable. Dennis Hopper was the rebellious face of US movie stars, he belonged to all of us who were born after the 60s, a time that changed lives, politics and the human landscape of America. He was grand and outspoken to the point of being blacklisted from movies for a good, long while. What is it about great artists and revolution? Well, part of that loaded question is answered in a new documentary, Along for the Ride by Nick Ebeling, making its world premiere in Venice in the Venezia Classici section. Along for the Ride takes the audience on a ride of course, a wondrous journey inside the mind and actions of Hopper, through the figure who was his right hand man for 47 years, Satya de la Manitou -- also a passenger on that passage. But the film goes one step further.Ebeling himself is a film aficionado, a man who cites Hopper's follow up to Easy Rider, an obscure work to most titled The Last Movie, as the ""film that changed my life, an obsession."" His passion is infectious and I found myself oohing and aahning at each new celebrity input, each person who came on to talk about Hopper. From Julian Schnabel to Dean Stockwell, and all the usual suspects in between, Along for the Ride is definitely a tribute to Dennis Hopper, the man, the complicated genius. But perhaps less apparent from the notes and synopsis of the film, but immediately visible to the audience, Ebeling's film is also an ode to the man behind the man, the wondrous, elegant, funny, fascinating and perfectly impenetrable de la Manitou -- a true icon of real American style.Oh, and by the way, I got to pose with both Ebeling and de la Manitou, wearing the original poncho worn by Hopper on The Last Movie, thanks to these wonderful gentlemen's lovely generosity. I felt like for a moment there, I was part of cinematic history. And I knew that somehow, somewhere, sitting in the grand movie theater in the sky surrounded by the likes of Kiarostami and Michael Cimino, Dennis Hopper approved.

Mind you, I usually don't watch boxing films and yet the stories of both these wondrous works of art drew me in without questions or hesitations.Of course, there was The Bleeder, which was carried by the star power heavyweight that is Liev Schreiber. In The Bleeder, calling his Chuck Wepner bigger than life would be an understatement.In São Jorge, which plays in the Orizzonti section in Venice, director Marco Martins portrays a quieter hero. Jorge is a man who is much more affected by the environment and social circumstances of the moment around him than by his own bad choices. Jorge is a lover, a father, an unemployed boxer who struggles to keep himself and those around him from drowning in the dire financial times of Portugal in the time of the European troika bailout measures. He wants desperately to provide, as great men do in his view, for those he loves but desperation is never an attractive -- nor productive quality. In fact, even when the broodingly handsome Jorge, played to quiet perfection by Nuno Lopes, tries to get his ex-wife Susana, played wonderfully by the real-life stunner Mariana Nunes, his desperate urgency is too much for her to bear, at first. I got to meet all three of the mega talents that make up São Jorge, and a full interview with Lopes, Martins and Nunes is upcoming. But in the meanwhile, let me just say that when their publicist enticed me by saying that they were all ""absolutely gorgeous"" he was right. The eyes want their part, this is the cinematic art after all, and although the austerity of the times in Portugal comes through in Carlos Lopes magnificently solemn cinematography, Sao Jorge is a film that kept me entranced and enthralled from frame one to the ending credits.While it was the visual aspect of São Jorge that drew me to watch it, with Keywan Karimi's Tabl (Drum) screening in the Critics' Week sidebar, what appealed to me was the controversy surrounding the filmmaker. Karimi has gone the way of so many beloved and respected filmmakers and intellectuals in Iran, symbolically gagged from speaking out and placed under house arrest. His crime? Discussing the un-discussible, talking about the un-talkable. In 2015, Karimi made a documentary called Writing on the City, about graffiti art in Tehran from the 1979 Islamic Revolution to Ahmadinejad's days. One would think that since those murals of rebellion -- as graffiti usually are -- were right there in open view, the filmmaker who simply captured them in a single cinematic essay would not have done anything wrong... But Karimi was accused of ""offending Islamic sacredness,"" and sentenced to varying degrees of imprisonment and 223 lashes. He's currently under house arrest but managed to get Tabl out by ""DHL, no issues, it was quite easy"" according to the film's producer François D'Artemare. D'Artemare has never met Karimi, but they ""Skype, WhatsApp, talk on the phone, it's a strange way to work with a director you've never met, but we have a kind of intimate relationship today,"" admitted the producer. Tabl is based on a book by Alimorad Fadaienia, an enigmatic Iranian intellectual who wrote the story in the 1960s at the time of the Shah's power. Today's Iran is quite different and yet this idea of a certain group of individuals who did things differently from the state's paid propagandists and the typical protesting intellectuals -- and thus shunned from both groups -- still rings true.

Trump responded to the email release with the suggestion that the Russians should look for additional emails from Hillary Clinton’s private server from her time at the State Department.“He has openly encouraged Russia to engage in cyberhacking to try to find more emails or materials, and we know that this cyberattack on the DNC was likely done by Russia,” Kaine said in an appearance on ABC’s “This Week with George Stephanopoulos.”Kaine compared it to the scandal that forced Republican President Richard Nixon to resign. “A president was impeached and had to resign over an attack on the DNC during a presidential election in 1972,” Kaine said. “This is serious business. So contrast the Hillary situation, where the FBI said there’s no need for legal proceedings, with an attack that is being encouraged by Donald Trump on the DNC by Russia similar to what led to the resignation of a president 30 years ago.”Russian President Vladimir Putin denied his country’s involvement in the hack earlier this week, but praised the release of the emails. “Listen, does it even matter who hacked this data?” he asked Bloomberg News. “The important thing is the content that was given to the public.” Trump’s kind words for Putin have raised concerns, as have his advisers’ connections to Russia.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

During his appearance, the Republican presidential nominee participated in prayer, gave a short speech focused on unity and held a private interview with church leader Bishop Wayne T. Jackson.Trump’s rhetoric has often been divisive and racist, and his visit to a Detroit church, one of his first moments of outreach to black voters, was seen as pandering. Some saw it as a strategic move to soften his image with white conservatives who are on the fence. Jackson’s interview ― for which Trump received questions ahead of time ― was dismissed as a publicity grab; it will air on Impact Network, Jackson’s TV station. But a number of those who heard the speech ― including members of the congregation and visitors from around the region ― liked what they heard.“I think he’s trying to understand African-American people,” said Carol Thomas, a member of the congregation who calls herself a Democrat but did not want to say whom she was planning to vote for. She appreciated what Trump said about improving schools and the economy.“If Mr. Trump is willing to have the churches in view and not put us on the back burner, then he’s the right one,” said Gwen Townsend, a Detroiter who usually attends another church. “I believe that he can do the job for the U.S.”Marjorie Wilson said she went into the service knowing “flat-out” that she wouldn’t vote for Trump. Now, she’s undecided, though she thinks his plans to deport undocumented immigrants are “cruel.”“God changed my heart, and I feel like God changed his heart,” Wilson said.Trump is definitively unpopular among black Americans. Only 1 percent of black voters support him nationally, according to a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll. It would take a miracle for him to win Detroit, an overwhelmingly black and Democratic city where President Barack Obama took 98 percent of the vote in 2012.  Trump released a memo outlining his “civil rights agenda” after his speech in Detroit and met with black leaders in Philadelphia on Friday. Last month, he made a controversial pitch to African-Americans during a speech in Dimondale, Michigan:“Look how much African-American communities are suffering under Democratic control. To those I say the following: What do you have to lose by trying something new, like Trump?” he said. “You’re living in poverty. Your schools are no good. You have no jobs. Fifty-eight percent of your youth is unemployed. What the hell do you have to lose?”“What we’ve got to lose? We got a lot to lose,” countered Keith Williams, who protested outside the church Saturday. “The Republican Party ain’t done nothing for us. At the end of the day, we did get our rights through Democrats.”“We’re not impoverished in Northwest Detroit,” Williams said about his neighborhood. “Everybody goes to church; the kids get educated; we go to work every day. That’s not the world that Donald Trump is trying to portray.”He and others were frustrated that they could not hear Trump’s speech themselves. “If he’s coming to black churchgoers, then why do you have to have a ticket to go to church?” Williams said. “I thought the doors of church was always open.”Still, a message of job creation and economic growth could resonate in Detroit, where the poverty rate is 40 percent. The stretch of Grand River Avenue where Great Faith Ministries is located is full of shuttered storefronts. Across the street from the church, Evergreen Furniture was open Saturday, but owner Lonnell Bailey said business has been a struggle. “A lot of the people moved away, a whole lot of the businesses are closed, so it’s just a depressed state right around here,” Bailey said. “There needs to be some money brought back into the neighborhood, to rebuild the neighborhood and the businesses and the people in the houses around here.”Bailey isn’t optimistic about either major-party presidential candidate sparking those changes for his neighborhood, but is probably voting for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Laketa Dumas, who lives in a suburb and works in a public school in Detroit, brought her 14-year-old son out to protest Trump on Saturday.“He doesn’t have a clear understanding of who African-Americans are,” Dumas said. “He’s just making some stereotypical views, and it’s demeaning ... and for Wayne T. Jackson to allow this to come on is an insult to the African-American people.” “We are educated. We do want the best for our children. We do want to live in good communities, and so that’s what has me angry. That’s why I’m out here today,” she added.Kamesheia Brooks, a member of Great Faith Ministries’ congregation who heard Trump speak, thought he showed a different attitude.“He wasn’t so caught up on [being] down on the blacks, but more so in a position of wanting to support and help blacks in the whole as a community,” said Brooks, an undecided voter. “I believe he was not thinking when he said all those other negative things.”Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

However, that could sharpen tensions with the United States over Syria policy.Turkey is fighting a three-decade-old Kurdish insurgency in its southeast and fears that gains by the Syrian Kurdish YPG will embolden militants at home. Turkey considers the YPG a terrorist organization and an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).“We are there to protect our border, to provide for our citizens safety of life and property, and to ensure Syria’s integrity,” Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said in a speech on Sunday, discussing the incursion, which Ankara calls Euphrates Shield.“We will never allow the formation of an artificial state in the north of Syria,” he told a crowd in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the mainly Kurdish southeast.The advance took place little more than a week after Turkey launched the Syrian incursion, deploying tanks and air power to support the rebels, who swept into the border town of Jarablus.On Saturday, Turkey and its rebel allies opened a new line of attack in northern Syria, rolling across the border some 55 km (34 miles) west of Jarablus.The United States had said on Saturday it some Islamic State targets in the region, but it did not say where.While the United States and Europe also regard the PKK as a terrorist group, Washington sees the YPG as a separate entity and an effective client in the fight against Islamic State in Syria. That position has caused friction with Turkey, a NATO member and a partner in anti-IS coalition.‘TERROR CORRIDOR’President Tayyip Erdogan on Sunday raised concern about the formation of a “terror corridor” along Turkey’s Syrian border.Speaking to reporters after a meeting with U.S. President Barack Obama at the G20 gathering of world leaders in China, Erdogan said: “It is our wish that a terror corridor not be formed across our southern border.”Erdogan has repeatedly said that Turkey’s allies should not be making a distinction between Islamic State and the YPG as both groups pose a threat to Turkey.Some Kurds have criticized Turkey for its role in Syria. A demonstration broke out along the Syrian border on Friday, where Turkey is building a concrete wall. Police used tear gas and water cannon to drive the protesters back.At a rally in Istanbul on Sunday, the co-head of Turkey’s Kurdish-rooted Peoples’ Democratic Party (HDP) denounced the incursion into Syria as an “invasion.”“The government, which says it wants to stop ISIS (Islamic State) with the Jarablus invasion, has no credibility. The invasion of Jarablus is totally an adversarial approach against Kurds and we will never accept it,” Selahattin Demirtas told reporters.Separately, Anadolu said Turkish warplanes hit four Islamic State positions on Saturday evening in Syria’s northwestern Aleppo province as part of the operation, citing security sources.The warplanes hit three targets in the al-Kaldi area and another in the Wuguf region, Anadolu said, citing the sources."

This put her in her place.”The SPD, which has ruled the rural state on the Baltic coast with the CDU as junior coalition partners since 2006, won 30.2 percent of the vote, down from 35.6 percent in the last election in 2011. The CDU won 19.8 percent, down from 23 percent in 2011, and its worst result ever in the state, the broadcaster said.The far-left Left Party won 12.5 percent, down from 18.4 percent five years ago, while the pro-environment Greens won 5 percent, down from 8.7 percent. The far-right NPD was knocked out of the state assembly, falling below the 5 percent threshold for the first time since 2006 with 3.2 percent, down from 6 percent in 2011.Despite losing support, the SPD (24 seats) and the CDU (16) won enough seats to be able to continue their grand coalition in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern with the AfD as the second-largest bloc in the 71-seat state assembly with 18 seats. The SPD, which could also form a coalition with the Left and Green parties, said it was leaving its options open.Voters already punished Merkel in three state elections in March, voting in droves for the AfD and rejecting Merkel’s Christian Democrats.Founded in 2013, the AfD now has won seats in nine of the 16 state assemblies across the country. However, it has no chance of governing in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern since the other parties have said they would not form a coalition with the party.The AfD is also making gains nationwide, a new poll showed on Sunday. If the national election were held next week, the AfD would win 12 percent of the vote, making it the third-largest party in Germany, according to a poll conducted by the Emnid institute for the Bild newspaper and published on Sunday.Merkel, mulling a bid for a fourth term as chancellor, made a last-minute campaign appearance on Saturday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, warning against the politics of “angst” offered by AfD with its virulent anti-refugee stance."

25,ENTERTAINMENT,"The Need For Believable Non-White Characters -- Sidekicks, Included","Rubi Taha, ContributorRubi Taha is a freelance writer living in New York",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-need-for-believable-non-white-characters-sidekicks_us_57c9c968e4b07addc412559e,Must a writer adjust a character when a black actor is cast in a role?,2016-09-04,"‘Stranger Things’ 2016: Lucas, Mike, Eleven and Dustin",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57caf9991700006429c7763d.jpg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Not one for science fiction, I figured I would try to get through one episode of Netflix series Stranger Things, if only to get in on the fervent conversation. I found myself watching all eight episodes over the course of two days, and immediately immersed myself in the analysis flooding the internet that week. Reviewers diligently laid out the classic elements of 80’s film & television that triggered such powerful nostalgia in so many viewers. Until this moment, I had no idea how much I’d missed watching latch-key-kid-centered, small-town-set narratives. Bullies are conquered, grown-ups are humorously exposed for the simpletons they are, teenagers struggle with virginity & peer-pressure, and on more than one instance, clever science saves the day! All agreed that the poignant chemistry between the kids’ characters serves ultimately as the heart of the show, and pivots it away from a gimmicky homage to the 80’s.The story centers around Mike (the protagonist), his best friends Lucas (the cynic) and Dustin (the goof), a new-found mysterious companion, Eleven, and the search for their missing friend Will. The group’s friendship dynamic mirrors classic 80’s kid adventure crews, featured in such films as The Lost Boys, and Stand by Me.What stood out to me immediately, was Lucas, one of a few black characters on the show. As the story progressed, I distractedly wondered who his family was, and what had brought them to that very white Indiana town. How do the other kids’ families feel about Lucas’ family? If Lucas had gone missing, would there have been a search party? (Although, no one seemed particularly bothered when Barb died, so that’s neither here nor there). Would the other moms have brought Lucas’ mom a lasagna while she grieved? Then, you have the schoolyard bullies, focused more on (presumably deceased) Will, referring to him as a ‘fag’, and on Dustin’s unfortunate dental issues than Lucas’ blackness as a target (although they do taunt him by calling him ‘Midnight’ at one point). As a testament to the show, it never felt as though Lucas didn’t belong in that world. Nevertheless, I wanted to see him actualized more as a person of color. Had it actually been 1983, my reaction would have been to feel grateful for his inclusion, period.As an eighties kid, I watched a significant amount of television, and, naturally, wanted to see kids that looked like me represented in media. There was no shortage of minority representation on primetime television. You had your all-black shows, like, 227, A Different World and The Jeffersons, which meant to reflect a black experience. Other shows were more of a fish-bowl format ― about black characters navigating a predominantly white situation. Webster, Diff’rent Strokes, Benson and Gimme A Break were popular examples, with premises set in white households that revolved around either black adopted kids, or black domestic help.Watching the all-black shows was like being in an affinity space, it at least felt as though the content was designed for and about black people. On the other hand, the shows in the Webster camp represented inclusion into the mainstream, which was clearly a tricky and often awkward thing to navigate. It’s disturbing to think that despite there being a demand for content that included people of color, these were the only integrated narratives the general public was comfortable with (although Benson did work his way up to lieutenant governor by the end of the series, so well done, them). Child-centric shows that got it right were The Cosby Show, Fat Albert and Sesame Street. Here was a rare opportunity to see black characters presented as something other than outliers that needed saving, or problems to be solved.Stranger Things’ Lucas is reminiscent of the 80’s era loyal (often sassy) sidekick, whose role was to offset the lovable but straight and narrow protagonist (while providing a dose of street cred). I often found myself focused more on said sidekick, however meager his or her role. I was especially drawn to programming that featured brown kids in an integrated cast (as this mirrored my actual world), and these characters, although marginalized, were often less offensive than those that reinforced racist stereotypes. Notable roles were Tootie Ramsey from the Facts of Life, as the youngest at an all girls boarding house, Alfonso Spears on Silver Spoons as Ricky Schroder’s break-dancing best friend, Data the gadget wielding dork on The Goonies, and my personal favorite, Cherie Johnson, Punky Brewster’s level-headed best friend (mostly because I looked exactly like her).It would be absurd to suggest that diverse casting require an accompanying plot with a social justice angle. Race, after all, need not be the focus on a show about, say, monsters in hidden dimensions. That said, one might question the authenticity of an imagined world which fails to notice the only brown person in it (unless, of course, its setting is post-racial, and by definition, alternate-reality). With this in mind, the question remains: must a writer adjust a character when a black actor is cast in a role? Moreover, are writers who choose not to do so succumbing to the short-sighted “I don’t see color” rhetoric, or are they simply being careless?In 1968, Charles M. Schulz, who penned the famous Peanuts comic strip, received a letter from a concerned school teacher, who was white. She asked him if he’d consider adding a black character to the gang, and argued that it would help ‘shape the unconscious attitudes of our kids’ to see and read about black and white children integrating. Schulz wrote back that he felt it would be condescending to include a black character for the sake of it. I imagine he recognized the weight & responsibility attached to the task and decided he wasn’t prepared to provide such a character with an authentic voice. Eventually, Schulz did create Franklin ― Charlie Brown’s ultra laid back friend, who never said much. Franklin’s blackness was never acknowledged beyond physically in the cartoon, which seems appropriate for that era, when much of the public was openly shocked at his initial appearance. Nearly fifty years later, it’s somewhat reassuring to see that Franklin did play a more prominent role in 2015’s Peanuts Movie.I can appreciate that on Stranger Things, the Duffer brothers could have been, by avoiding allusions to race, keeping the ‘80s feel all the way real. In spite of this, writing authentic characters of color without necessarily ‘making it about race’ continues to be a real struggle in film and television. It is rare to see dialogue and action that subtly reflects ordinary moments and situations plausibly experienced by an actual person of color. An obvious solution is to hire more writers of color on projects. Scandal and How To Get Away With Murder stand out as a holy grail show among black women, in large part, because of Shonda Rhimes’ inclusion of detail (not necessarily an overarching theme) that reflects a distinctly black reality. A flashback featuring Viola Davis’ character sitting between her mother’s legs as she braids her hair is moving for a black audience as a familiar shared experience that is rarely represented in mainstream media. Sidenote: Rhimes doesn’t always get it right ― witness Black Twitter explode when Olivia Pope steps out of the shower with soaking wet hair only to appear inexplicably in the next scene rocking a salon blowout.If authenticity is the goal, writers must be involved who have an understanding of how a non-white experience looks, sounds and feels. Despite this, diverse writing teams continue to be a rarity. In the New Yorker feature In Living Color, Emily Nussbaum chronicles Kenya Barris’ (creator of ABC’s Blackish) experiences as a black writer and show developer in Hollywood. Barris describes the challenge faced as a “diversity hire” among predominantly white writing staffs on white shows, as well as witnessing their disconnectedness when writing black characters. This would explain why so many characters of color are either written as though they were white, or as blatant black stereotypes. Take for example, a black, Kanye-esque character on the FX show You’re The Worst named, laughably, “Shitstain.” The show’s writers attempt to depict a complex street-yet-smart skaterboy rapper, but instead, we end up with an ignorant-sounding, unlikeable and offensive caricature.Meanwhile, majority non-white cast shows understand the importance of using writers of color, as Slate writer Aisha Harris points out. Today, those shows are among network television’s most successful, as well as created or executively produced by people of color-among them are the aforementioned Barris, Rhimes, and Empire’s Lee Daniels. Non-white shows, headed by non-white execs, it would seem, are the only place writers of color have a seat at the table.Since the 80s, we have made progress: successful Black, Hispanic and Asian shows are being created, written, and produced by people of color now, resulting in authentic-feeling characters that are representative of the people they depict. Also, Hollywood has developed more sensibility in recognizing and avoiding overtly racist premises and stereotypes. Sadly, however, most white-majority cast shows continue to feature, if at all, token brown characters that are either written poorly, or underdeveloped. The non-white minor character may seem doomed to remain forever marginalized. Fortunately however, it’s 2016 and we no longer have just four or five channels to choose from. Television today is saturated with hundreds of networks turning out countless shows each season, and some do get it right. By paying attention to lazy writing and non-inclusive casting, it really is possible as viewers to hone in on quality shows that acknowledge their non-white audience by including believable characters of color."
26,COLLEGE,Mad About Brock Turner? Maybe You Shouldn't Be.,"Mia Goldstein, ContributorStudent at The University of Texas at Austin",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mad-about-brock-turner-maybe-you-shouldnt-be_us_57cc685be4b0b9c5b73934c7,This should surprise no one.,2016-09-04,Turner's mugshot from the night of his arrest in January 2015,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57cc68f1180000bc28bcf279.jpg?cache=QM2xW18K6r&ops=crop_0_169_797_543%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Brock Turner, the man who raped an unconscious woman behind a dumpster (and the newly minted poster boy for campus rape), was released on Friday after serving just three months of his six-month sentence.Everyone is rightfully angered about the sentencing and the privilege that resulted in a slap on the wrist for multiple felonies. His crimes warrant at least 14 years in prison, and the fact that he served only half of his original sentence while in protective custody is a gross testament to just how powerful white privilege is.However, this should surprise no one. The justice system being skewed in favor of rich, white, well-educated, cisgender and heterosexual men is not a news story. In a society where cops can kill innocent, unarmed people of color in the streets without even seeing an indictment, no one should be surprised that this extraordinarily privileged Stanford swimmer got off this easy. It’s worthy of outrage, but if you are shocked, you are not paying attention.Should his sentence have been longer? Absolutely. He, like every other rapist, deserves to rot behind bars. Why Judge Aaron Persky was lenient is beyond me. Brock Turner sent pictures of this woman’s unconscious, naked body to his friends and bragged about his sexual conquests. He assaulted her behind a dumpster. He was laughing when he was caught. He was not and does not appear to be remorseful. If he was sober enough to photograph and brag about her, he was sober enough to know exactly what he was doing.Beyond that, in the statement he made to the judge, he didn’t accept any shred of responsibility for his actions. He said he “never wants to drink again” because he believes alcohol put him in this situation. He didn’t say, “Wow, I never want to rape again. I did unconscionable damage to this woman’s life and my own. Next time I want to have sex with someone, I’ll ask for their consent and if they are too intoxicated, I will simply not have sex with them.” But no, he blamed it on booze, “peer pressure” and “promiscuity.”But when talking about this case, people seem to be forgetting that in terms of getting justice, Brock Turner is the exception, not the rule. My best guess is that this is due to Law and Order: SVU, where Mariska Hargitay always catches the rapist and then locks him up for 25-plus years. This is not how it works. Dick Wolf doesn’t write the real world.Here are some statistics (from RAINN):Out of every 1000 rapes:344 are reported to the police For every 1000 rapes, 994 perpetrators will walk free. 99.4 percent of all rapists will never face a single consequence for their actions and there is nothing stopping them from doing it again and again and again. And they do.Brock Turner is a part of the tiny percentage (.6 percent) of sexual assailants who has seen the inside of a jail cell. If there’s any news story here at all, it’s that a rapist actually served time (even if it was only for a few months and more on par with a “time-out”).Turner will pay for what he did. Yes, his sentence was too light given the heinousness of his crimes and the fact that he’s being released early for “good behavior” seems like justice has not been served. However, more “justice” has been served in this case than in 99.4 percent of instances of sexual violence.His face has been plastered on every media outlet for months. The entire world knows he’s a rapist. Even if people don’t immediately recognize his name twenty years from now, a quick Google search will solve that. He’s on the sex offender registry. Brock Turner will walk around with a scarlet “RAPIST” branded on his forehead for the rest of his life. That is all he will ever be. The other sex offenders in his court-mandated rehab program will recognize his face from the newspapers and whisper, “Well, at least I’m not that guy.” He’s banned from swimming, expelled from school, and the life he knew is rightfully ruined.Though he won’t be sitting in a cell for the next 14 years, the public vilification will make him wish he were. Jail was just one of the many forms of punishment that he will face for the rest of his pathetic life. So while you’re outraged that Turner was only incarcerated for three months, remember that it’s more prison time than what 99.4 percent of what other rapists get. And maybe it’s time to get outraged about that, too.While we’re on the subject of this case, let’s stop calling this woman a “victim.” She is a survivor. And surviving sexual violence is more than just living through the violence itself. It’s surviving the lingering trauma every day after. She fought like hell in court, was forced to relive the worst night of her life over and over again, all while being picked apart by a defense attorney whose only job was to make it look like she was asking for it. This woman is a warrior and she deserves to be treated as such. Need help? Visit RAINN’s National Sexual Assault Online Hotline or the National Sexual Violence Resource Center’s website."

Following the vicious online attack, Jones understandably took a break from social media. Following the hack, the “Ghostbusters” star stayed silent online, but on Saturday afternoon, she made her triumphant return to Twitter. In one tweet, Jones seems to address her haters by professing her love for “The Golden Girls.” (Who doesn’t love “The Golden Girls”?) Jones’ voice is heard saying, “I don’t care what nobody say, these bitches make me laugh no matter what the hell is going on, for real,” as a clip of the show’s opening credits plays. After receiving plenty of support from fans regarding her return to Twitter, Jones thanked her followers, telling everyone she’s “soooooo ok.” Since becoming one of the summer’s biggest breakout stars, Jones has had to deal with hordes of unwarranted hate by the racist trolls who live in the dark underbelly of the internet.The actress called out her harassers on Twitter earlier this summer by responding to some of their hateful comments. Jones also opened up about the trolls on “Late Night with Seth Meyers,” calling the harassment “so gross and mean and unnecessary.” “What’s scary about the whole thing is the insults didn’t hurt me,” Jones said. “Unfortunately, I’m used to insults, but what scared me was the injustice of a gang of people jumping against you for such a sick cause.” Since sharing her “Golden Girls” tweet, Jones seems to be back in full force on the social media site. It’s good to have you back, Leslie.This post has been updated to include Jones’ thank you tweet to her fans. "
