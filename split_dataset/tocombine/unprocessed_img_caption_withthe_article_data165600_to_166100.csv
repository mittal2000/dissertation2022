0,PARENTING,What I Realized From Shopping With My Son and Daughter,"Debbie Leon, Contributor

We had a wonderful time, marred only by a minor incident in a store where she spent an hour trying on clothes. And since Paris was waiting outside, I admit to being less than thrilled to be sitting there in a store that seemed no different than those at home. I am not someone who is excited by clothes and accessories, as she is, but for the sake of family harmony I pretended to be happy while she blissfully shopped.Upon coming home, however, I realized that the only thing worse than shopping with someone who loves to shop is shopping with someone who shares my antipathy. Before he left for college last week, my 20-year-old son had a short list of things he needed to buy for school: a pair of shoes, a pair of pants and a backpack. His father and I usually do his shopping for him, but as he is now practically a grown up it seemed not unrealistic to expect him to participate. He spent most of the past two weeks on the couch -- resting -- so we weren't able to go shopping until the day before he left. I took the day off work, and was ready to roll by 9:00. At 2:00 p.m., I first heard him stir. I would like to give myself a pat on the back for still being calm and cheerful when we finally headed to the mall at 3:00. To minimize our time in stores, we decided that we would start at Macy's, which would be most likely to have all three items. We optimistically planned to be home by 5:00.After five minutes in the store, I realized why the men's department is always on the first floor of department stores: men will not go out of their way to find what they are looking for. The shoe department was at the far end of the floor, and it was actually a struggle for me to convince my athletic son to walk all that way. We passed several sections selling pants, but decided it would be easier to tackle the shoes first. I thought it would be simple, as he wanted to replace the exact same shoes that he had just thrown away: Sperry top-siders. Unfortunately, they didn't have his size. The nice salesman tried to explain how we could order them and have them mailed, but that seemed like far too much work. And having already walked past the pants, neither of us were motivated to retrace our steps, so we left. We were not off to a great start.On to Gap. He looked at one pair of pants, pronounced them ""too thin and the wrong shade of khaki,"" and we were out of there in two minutes. This was repeated in the next three stores we went into. He refused to ask for help, and looking through piles of pants on tables for the correct size was torture. Neither of us were helped by the labels: ""1869,"" "" full fit,"" ""straight leg"" or, my personal favorite, ""Warren."" In J. Crew he went as far as to try on a pair, but these too were rejected for being too fancy. Mind you, he was looking for the most basic item of clothing in the world: khaki chinos. I finally asked him what exactly he was looking for, and it turned out that when he said he wanted to same pair he already had, he meant the exact same pair, last season's style, and just as worn and comfy. I explained to him -- still somewhat patiently -- that stores change their merchandise and the likelihood of us finding the exact same pair of pants, with the same comfy worn bits, was impossible and he would have to be a bit adaptable. With that understanding he allowed me to coax him into the Banana Republic. They had a wall of khaki pants, clearly labeled and sized. They know how to make it easy for non-shoppers to shop. So thank you, Banana Republic! One hour in -- only one meltdown and only one item checked off the list.He was now ready to forget the shoes and backpack. Since he had thrown his shoes away as they were worn to bits, I knew he needed to find another pair. I explained that the same principle held for shoes, and that he was unlikely to be able to find a pair that precisely resembled the ones he purchased in 2007. With that understanding, we went to Nordstrom, saw a pair similar to his old ones, briefly toyed with going for a different color and then came to our senses. The shoes were purchased and we were out of there in five minutes, interrupting the nice salesman as he did his spiel in our haste to flee.As for the backpack, both of us were exhausted and hungry at this point. (Why does shopping make you hungry? How many calories does trudging around actually burn?) We made two half-hearted attempts to look, found nothing, and when he told me that the large hole in this backpack wouldn't be a problem, I allowed myself to be convinced, even though he had just lost his keys through that very hole. We can always replace a set of keys, but there was no way either of us was capable of spending another minute in a store. But at least he wasn't asking me to pretend to be enjoying myself."

Washington Convention Center on January 21, 2013 in Washington, DC.

Ever since the Obamas took up residence at the White House, the nation has been quick to chronicle and critique her clothing choices, triggering unwarranted debates on everything from price tags to supposed symbolic value. We are a nation obsessed, and with good reason: we have a first lady we can relate to and her clothes serve as a constant reminder of her accessibility.Our fixation with Michelle's style transcends purely superficial ""who wore it best"" conversations and frivolous banter, it celebrates female power. We admire our first lady's signature style because she takes risks. Michelle has stepped out in shorts, bared her arms, worked out on late-night television shows and we relate to those informal moments. She wears pieces straight from the runways and J.Crew catalogues alike with a certain casualness; mixing in Target pieces and re-wearing pricey frocks proving she's just a regular mom-in-chief. Aware of the influence of her clothing choices, she doesn't favor one label, rather she selects traditional pieces from classic fashion houses (Ralph Lauren and Oscar de la Renta) in addition to cutting-edge contemporary designers whose names we can not pronounce (Prabal Gurung and Naeem Khan), all the while looking fresh, confident and always appropriate. Her fashion is functional -- there's nothing stuffy or costumey about her choices. Michelle knows what you wear says a lot about who you are, and her wardrobe conveys a message about being a woman of substance and style.To quote Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games, ""hope... is the only thing stronger than fear..."" I am familiar with hope. My parents raised me to be an independent, ambitious, confident woman. From a very young age I was repeatedly told ""I could do anything,"" in addition to being reminded regularly that I was smart, beautiful and loved. Seeing as I went through one hell of an awkward stage, and had overachieving Ivy League-bound siblings, the smart and beautiful parts did not resonate with me (didn't parents have to say that to their kids?) as much as the promise that I could create my own destiny. Armed with hope and a solid work ethic, I was determined to forge my own path in life: choosing a Southern University over the New England schools my friends attended, a career in fashion armed with only a liberal arts degree and a life in DC with no local friends, family, job connections or even an interest in politics. But at each junction in life a little voice from within encouraged me to follow my dreams, and upon each success asked me, ""what now, what's next?"" That voice kept me moving forward and challenging the status quo. Michelle, who dared to wear a bold red Alexander McQueen dress to a state dinner and took a public stance on political initiatives like healthy eating, continues to inspire me to take chances. I remember exactly where I was when Michelle Obama stood beside Barack on election night and again on Inauguration Day in 2009; I was 25 and working for a prominent stylist, looking back I can say that was the most thin, tired and broke I've ever been. It was also one of the most exciting times in my life -- working long hours learning my craft firsthand from a true expert in the field who demanded perfection from herself and her staff, and making the most of the few precious hours in between exploring my new city. While extremely overworked and underpaid, I had the sense that this was the beginning of something bigger, both personally and professionally. DC was growing and changing, and so was I. Michelle Obama embodied her husband's campaign message of hope and change by leaving behind the pastel pantsuits and quiet smiles of the generations before her, thus shattering the conventional image of a first lady.So will we be talking about Michelle Obama's outfit? Of course, but her clothes and the dialogues they promote will occur amongst people who no longer feel estranged from the first lady. Somewhere in America there are little girls dreaming about being the first lady or the first female president, and Michelle's clothes give them hope... hope that they too can defy society's expectations and stereotypes."

She shrugs.PLUS: What is Autism?Jackson was 3 years old at the time, and by all accounts -- from mother's intuition to the experts' definition -- he was on the spectrum. The behavioral psychologists saw what we saw, but were hesistant to make an official diagnosis. His brain is still developing. So much can change in six months. So time passed. His clothes went from 4T to 5T. Birthday candles were lit, blown out, and saved in the kitchen drawer. By age 6, the appointments with the behavioral psychologists were over. The autism books came off my wife's nightstand. Our tears were redirected to other things like kindergarten graduations.It's a mystery we still don't understand. Did he have autism and develop out of it? Did he ever have autism? Slowly but surely, experts are unraveling this developmental disorder, and last week a small but groundbreaking study may just prove that Jackson is not alone.PLUS: Should I Label My Kid?The study, funded by the National Institute of Health, researched 34 individuals ages 8 to 21 who had been diagnosed with autism early in life. The study found that they no longer had the symptoms. The conclusion: Some people may age out of autism. Of course, the autism community is buoyed by the findings, but are cautious to say this is a common outcome. Let's add to this discussion a study that appeared in Pediatrics last year. It focused on 61 children aged 14 to 35 months who were on the spectrum. Two years after their initial diagnosis, 20 percent of those children no longer met the ASD criteria, which suggests that either the children are improving or were misdiagnosed from the start.Meanwhile, the prevalence of autism has consistently been on the rise. In 1998, it was 1 in 1,000. In 2002, it was 1 in 150. Today, it's 1 in 88. Is it our increasing awareness that's inflating those figures? Is something mutating in our DNA? Does it lurk in our air or cleaning products or groundwater?That's the thing with autism: There is no pathology. It's not in the blood. Biopsies don't detect it. It doesn't appear when you shine a penlight into the pupil. It makes perfect sense that this disorder is represented in awareness campaigns by a puzzle piece.For our family, the autism spectrum was like the Alaskan winter. There was no light. The darkness went on and on and on. Then one day, a yolk-hued color broke across the horizon. And it stayed.

3,WELLNESS,Did Perfectionism Fuel Armstrong's Pervasive Lies?,"Dr. Elizabeth Lombardo, Contributor

Lance Armstrong's reported admission to Oprah Winfrey that he used performance-enhancing drugs likely means he will go down in history as the most brazen drug cheat the sport has ever seen. The disgraced American cyclist's comments, reported January 14, 2013 by USA Today, rewrite 14 years of deception and repeated denials that he used banned substances to win scores of international races, including the Tour de France seven times. His years of dominance in the sport's greatest race raised cycling's profile in the United States to new heights and gave Armstrong a platform to promote cancer awareness and research. AFP PHOTO / TIMOTHY A. CLARY/TORSTEN BLACKWOOD (Photo credit should read TIMOTHY A. CLARY,TORSTEN BLACKWOOD/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cbbdb2400003200535082.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As the world watched Lance Armstrong finally admit that he had repeatedly used banned substances to fuel his unparalleled Tour de France wins, many were left with a pervasive, nagging, ""Why?""Why did he feel the need to use? Why did he repeatedly lie, even under oath? Why did he bully others around him?During his interview with Oprah Winfrey, Lance described his previous image as the perfect hero: one who overcame a deadly diagnosis of testicular cancer, repeatedly winning the Tour de France and having a happy marriage and family. ""It's just this mythic, perfect story, and it isn't true,"" he said.Was it Armstrong's desire to be perfect (or viewed as perfect) that fueled his pervasive lies? Much evidence supports that the answer is ""yes.""Armstrong has the classic signs of perfectionism, including:• Being intensely competitive and not being able to stand others doing better than you. It has been documented that, starting as young as 11 years old, Armstrong was extremely competitive, with a narrowed focus on winning.• Doing something ""perfectly"" (at least in the eyes of the beholder) or not at all. Armstrong engaged in doping as a means to win. His desire to be the best led him to use illegal substances.• Being obsessive in the desire to be perfect (in Armstrong's case, to win and have a positive self-image). Armstrong admitted to his obsessive nature: ""I took that attitude -- the ruthless, relentless, win-at-all-costs attitude."" • Demanding ""perfection"" from other people: While Armstrong continued to deny it during his interview with Oprah, teammates have described interactions with Armstrong encouraging (some may say bullying) them to use performance-enhancing drugs so that Armstrong's team would win. As David Coyle, who wrote a book about doping and the Tour de France, told CNN's Anderson Cooper on Thursday night, ""Tyler Hamilton [a member of the US Postal Service Cycle Team with Armstrong] gets a phone call: Be on a plane tomorrow. We're flying to Valencia to do a blood transfusion. That's what happens.""• Trying to hide any flaws or perceived weaknesses. Armstrong admitted to bullying others in an attempt to maintain his deception. ""I was a bully in the sense that I tried to control the narrative, and if I didn't like what somebody said, and for whatever reasons in my own head whether I viewed that as somebody being disloyal or a friend turning on you or whatever, I tried to control that.""• Persisting at a task long after other people have quit. We can see this in Armstrong's perseverance in riding in the Tour de France, including his comeback in 2010. We also see this persistence in the years and years he kept up his long strand of deceptions. • Finding faults in others and correcting them when they are wrong (or when you want others to think they are wrong). Armstrong was very public in the past against the people who accused him of using performance-enhancing drugs. For example, when asked by Oprah about Armstrong's former massage therapist, Emma O'Reilly, who testified regarding Armstrong's doping habits, Armstrong responded, ""She's one of the people who got run over and got bullied."" ""You sued her,"" Winfrey responded. Armstrong: ""To be honest, Oprah, we sued so many people ... I'm sure we did.""• Being highly aware of other people's demands and expectations. As noted at the beginning of this article, Armstrong was very aware that others saw and expected his ""perfect"" life.Yes, it appears as though a sense of perfectionism was one of the contributing factors to Armstrong's pervasive lies. This is not to say that all perfectionists are dishonest bullies who will go to any length (even breaking the law) to achieve what they want. As a recovering perfectionist who works with many other perfectionists, I can attest to this.However, it does call into question the role of perfectionism in Armstrong's huge web of lies that have damaged his image, destroyed others' reputations and lead to a worldwide infatuation with #LieStrong.What do you think?For more by Dr. Elizabeth Lombardo, click here.For more on mental health, click here."

5,TRAVEL,Alaska Travel: Chasing The Aurora Borealis With Kids,"MiniTime, Contributor
MiniTime is the first family travel site with personalized rec...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/aurora-borealis-kids_us_5b9cbc91e4b03a1dcc815adb,"For families that live in the Lower 48, the most fantastic natural light show on Earth is worth the trip north.",2013-01-21,2013-01-20-Alaska_AuroraBorealis_RonnMurrayPhotography2.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-01-20-Alaska_AuroraBorealis_RonnMurrayPhotography2.jpg,"You've heard of storm chasing. Up in Alaska, they have aurora chasing. That means hunting for the best views of the mystical aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights. Though the phenomenon takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn (Aurora) and the Greek word for the north wind (Borealis), the term is actually a misnomer. It's the solar wind -- not the north wind -- that stirs up auroral storms. The aurora borealis happens when the earth's atmosphere comes in contact with particles from the sun, which are guided toward the earth's magnetic poles. Depending upon a storm's strength, activity can range from a greenish glow in the sky to whipping, whirling ribbons of neon scarlet and yellow that appear to dance off the horizon. For families that live in the Lower 48, the most fantastic natural light show on Earth is worth the trip north. Here are five tips for experiencing Alaska's aurora borealis with kids:Aim for Mid-Winter. The optimal viewing season runs from October and March, thought the lights start showing up as soon as Alaska's daylight fades in early autumn. Experts predict that the 11-year solar cycle is due to peak during the winters of 2013 and 2014, promising more frequent and more spectacular displays.  Get out of the City. Artificial light has a dampening effect. From Alaska's largest city of Anchorage, you might see occasional glimmers of green, but to truly appreciate the breathtaking beauty of the aurora borealis, you need to get away from light pollution and head into the countryside. Some family-friendly resorts are particularly popular with aurora chasers. Located 60 miles northeast of Fairbanks, Chena Hot Springs Resort bundles recreation and relaxation with opportunities for viewing the aurora. This backwoods resort is extremely popular with Asian tourists, who believe the lights offer spiritual inspiration for fertility. Chena Hot Springs also rates high among Alaskans, who flock there to soak in the three mineral pools. Kids will love the on-site ice museum, local reindeer herd, and dog-sledding at nearby Chena Kennels.  (photo: Ronn Murray Photography)Find a Family-Friendly Guide Salmon Berry Tours offer northern lights-viewing packages out of Anchorage, driving guests two hours north to the tiny community of Talkeetna. The tour begins with soup and hot cocoa, and ends with a snowshoe trek to nearby Talkeetna River for a look into the heavens. Ronn Murray, father of two and a professional photographer, guides trips for 1st Alaska Outdoor School in Fairbanks, offering a variety of options for aurora viewing suitable for the entire family, including an intense photo tour that particularly appeals to 'tweens and teens. Check the Forecast As you might expect, viewing is best on a clear night at a time when solar activity is high. The University of Alaska Fairbanks Geophysical Institute's Aurora Forecast page is full of handy information and they've even got a smartphone app. Bring the Right Gear. Alaskan winters, especially in Interior Alaska, can bring temperatures down to -40 F, so you need to pack appropriate clothing and footwear for the whole family. Non-cotton layers are a must; fleece, wool, and down insulating materials work best to trap warm inner air, then top it all off with a weather-proof outer layer. Boots should be rated to -25 F, and mittens are better than gloves. Note that ears, cheeks, and noses are extremely prone to frostbite, so bring masks, neck gaiters or heavy scarves to protect faces. Some tour companies and resorts will provide outerwear for guests; ask when making reservations.--Erin Kirkland, AKontheGo.com"

For the rest, it wasn't clear why they were late getting their shots. Some could have bounced in and out of insurance coverage, Glanz suggested, or were sick during their well-child visits, so doctors postponed vaccines.Undervaccinated kids also tended to have fewer doctors' appointments and emergency room visits than those who got their shots on time, according to findings published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.That could be because their parents more often turn to alternative or complementary medicine when it's an option, Omer said.Recent studies have shown many parents asking to delay or skip certain vaccines, often citing safety concerns such as a link between vaccines and autism - a theory which scientists now agree holds no water.""We don't really know if these 'alternative schedules' as they're called are as safe, less safe or more safe than the current schedule, Glanz told Reuters Health, adding that parents who are considering an alternative vaccination schedule should talk with their child's doctor first - and be especially careful about what they read online.""We don't have any evidence that there are any safety concerns with the current recommended schedule, and right now the best way to protect your child from infection is to get your child vaccinated on time,"" he said.

Broken wrists jumped from the then most common injury before snowboarders were allowed to the second most common at the end of the study.On the other hand, lower body injuries that are most typical among skiers, such as anterior cruciate ligament or ACL tears, and knee sprains, remained constant.During the study period, the number of visitors to the mountain also rose, from an average of 1,610 per day during the 2006 to 2007 season until March 2008, to 1973 visits per day from March 2008 to the end of the 2009 to 2010 season.The average age of injured people dropped, from 39 years old without snowboarders to 31 with them.The researchers were unable to say why the number of injuries increased, but previous research suggests snowboarders are more injury-prone than skiers.Last year, Johnson and his colleagues found that snowboarders accounted for 19 percent of injuries at one ski mountain in Vermont, but only made up 17 percent of athletes on the slopes.The new report avoids suggesting that snowboarding is the more dangerous sport, or that skiers are taking more risk by sharing the slopes, and suggests that other factors than the type of skiing may play a role.These may include that snowboarding has brought in a younger group of people, who tend to take more risks, as well as raising the overall number of people on the slopes, the researchers said.
