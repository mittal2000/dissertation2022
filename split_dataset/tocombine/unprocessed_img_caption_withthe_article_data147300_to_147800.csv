0,WELLNESS,My Definition of Healthy Is Better Than Yours,"Jordan K. Turgeon, Contributor
Opinion Editor, HuffPost",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lululemon-plus-size_us_5b9d65f9e4b03a1dcc8782d2,"For me, health means strength. Health means trying each day to treat my body well. That kind of health goes beyond just diet and exercise. It comes in a variety of sizes. And if you don't carry that size in your store, I'm happy to take my money elsewhere.",2013-08-02,2013-08-01-941984_10102199482052217_1063324541_n.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-08-01-941984_10102199482052217_1063324541_n-thumb.jpg,"When I read Kim Bhasin's recent HuffPost article detailing retailer Lululemon's attitude toward plus-size customers, I wasn't totally surprised. In the piece, a former employee described her experience working for the company, known for its expensive yoga wear, and how the size 10s and 12s ""were relegated to a separate area at the back of the store, left clumped and unfolded under a table."" Another employee, a former store supervisor, said the size 12s were ""not displayed normally"" in her store.My train of thought after reading Bhasin's piece went something like this:Wow. I definitely have to share this article on Facebook. Perhaps accompanied by a .gif of the Hulk and a few choice words about how a size 10 or 12 is hardly fat or plus-size. And why do we feel the need to label people as plus-sized, anyway? Can't we just stick to using numbers, like we do for the ""normal-size"" people? You know what? I'm going to tweet out this piece and express my dismay, even though I'm usually not one to go the whole shaming-a-company-by-tweeting-at-them route. People need to know how offensive this kind of thing can be.After taking a few much-needed moments to calm down (rule number one of social media: think before you post), I deleted both instead of hitting submit. But the article stayed at the front of my mind the rest of the day, the metaphorical steam coming out of my ears.If you haven't guessed by now, I fall into that plus-size category, according to some clothing companies. I've been wearing mostly 10s and 12s since I left my teen years behind.So why didn't I voice my thoughts the day the article hit? Because I got scared. Because despite working for a large online media organization, I'm a fairly private person. Because even though I'm comfortable with my body, it still stings to see us 10s and 12s and any other number being called ""fatties"" on social media platforms or in the comments section of an article -- even though we know those people are simply ignorant and cruel and don't deserve a millisecond of our time.I was scared. Still am. But to hell with it. This photo was taken in June after I completed my first 10K. I felt strong and beautiful in that moment. My size 10-12 self in its post-race glory. Am I the picture of optimal health and athleticism? Nope. Am I going to come out with a fitness DVD any time soon? Definitely not. But I refuse to be told I'm not healthy, either, which is what I feel companies are telling customers when they don't treat us the same as they do their more willowy patrons.I know I'm not the only one who feels this way: I've read the comments and tweets in response to Bhasin's article. And I know women who have run marathons and completed triathlons and who have thighs and breasts and hips and who couldn't fit into a size 2 yoga pant if they wore the world's best girdle. So why do we let people tell us that being a certain clothing size or weight should be our ultimate endgame?Former employees and consumer advocates told Bhasin that, ""this treatment of larger clothes and customers reflects the culture that Lululemon represents -- one that falsely suggests skinniness is the paramount feature of health.""Breaking news: Some of us don't follow a healthy lifestyle for the weight loss, or to go down a dress size, or so we feel comfortable rocking a ""bikini-ready bod"" on the beach. I do my best to eat well because I feel better when I do. So that I might live a long life. I exercise because of the high I get afterward, which makes me feel like I can accomplish anything. I work out because doing so reminds me of the incredible things our bodies can do. And when I look in the mirror, I try every time to focus on all the parts of me that make me strong. Instead of seeing a -- gasp! -- size 10-12 rear end complete with -- gasp! -- cellulite, I see thighs that propel me during a run. A butt that helped me spring right out of the water the first time I ever tried wake boarding last summer.Now, let's not overlook the obvious. Are there people in this country who genuinely need extreme help? Who are stuck in dangerous sedentary lifestyles and unhealthy eating habits that feel horribly and impossibly inescapable? Absolutely. But guess what? If people like me, who strive to live as healthy and balanced as possible each day, are made to feel inadequate, how on earth can we expect those who feel their situation is beyond hopeless to even see a point in trying?Active wear companies, listen to those of us who are trying. Who have already long realized that we're only given one body, so we best treat it well. Because some of us don't fit the mold of what is considered ""healthy"" in today's obsessed-with-being-thin culture. And when we hear companies that are supposedly all about wellness and positivity would rather not create clothes to fit our (strong, amazing, powerful) bodies -- clothes we wear while striving for that healthy, positive lifestyle they claim to promote, mind you -- we get frustrated. We feel betrayed. And when we are called fat in the comments section and on social media and are told no one wants to see our behinds in a pair of yoga pants, anyway, it's enough to make us turn green in the face and go all Hulk-like.If companies don't want to make clothes in certain sizes for whatever reason -- business strategy, cost-efficiency or otherwise -- that is completely, 100 percent their prerogative; I don't own the company, so I can't take issue. I've been in plenty of situations where a store's sizing just doesn't work for my figure, and it's not the end of the world, and I don't take offense. But to create the products and then treat certain sizes, and the customers buying them, differently, as Bhasin's article alleges, just doesn't make sense.I'd never been inside a Lululemon store -- their prices don't jive with my budget -- and I wanted to experience the atmosphere for myself. I was happy to see that the New York store I visited had plenty of 10s and 12s mixed in with the smaller sizes. This was just one store, in one city, and one five-minute visit, and plenty of people -- including those interviewed for Bhasin's piece -- have described less-than-pleasant experiences. But it gave me a bit of hope, and when given the option, I'm always going to choose hope. Health is relative. For me, health means strength. Health means trying each day to treat my body well. That kind of health goes beyond just diet and exercise. It comes in a variety of sizes.And if you don't carry that size in your store, I'm happy to take my money elsewhere.Tell us how you define healthy aside from pounds or pant size. Do you stay active?

Wallpaper has had resurgence in powder rooms in recent years -- it feels ""safer"" to limit wallpaper to small spaces -- but now it's beginning to unabashedly adorn the walls of living rooms and bedrooms alike.2. Navy, Gold, and White. This chic color palette is dramatic and sophisticated. A gold table lamp is the perfect starting point to introduce this trend into your home. Not feeling the navy wall? Stick with white walls and bring in navy home d√©cor.3. Chalky Pastels. Gone are the bubblegum pinks and baby blues -- the pastels of old have been replaced with more sophisticated grayed tones that have a softness and elegance. Dusty pastel hues are beautiful when paired with more saturated ones -- think chalky aqua with vibrant coral. 4. Pattern Mixing. Geometrics, stripes, Ikats, and polka dots are being layered in new and fresh ways. To keep the look for getting too cluttered, pick a unifying element to tie them all together. For example, in above left photo, navy is the consistent color. 5. Luxe Details. Diamond tufting and nailheads are designer details that give a plain piece of furniture serious pizzazz. Look for these luxe accents on sofas, chairs, headboards, and tables.6. Over Dyed Rugs. What was once a way to give worn, faded rugs new life has become a vibrant home trend. The essence of a traditional rug pattern peeks through a colorful layer of candy-colored dye. Shades of yellow, aqua, and red were most prominent.7. Metallic Accents. And not just any metallic accents -- think bits of silver and gold in unexpected places and in unexpected materials, like the printed cowhide rugs above.8. Industrial Chic. A mix of mid-century influence with edgy industrial details, the industrial chic look is a nod to the past that's been reinvented in a new way.

But this is not the stuffed grape leaves recipe we're sharing with you today. It's not that we have anything against dolmades -- they're great and should be eaten often with lots of feta -- but when faced with the option of goat cheese in place of rice, the choice is easy. This stuffed grape leaves recipe is nothing more than soft goat cheese flavored with fresh thyme, rosemary and lavender. It's all wrapped in grape leaves and grilled until crisp on the outside with a slightly melted interior.

Hugging? Really...? Are you serious? Whatever....",2013-08-02,2016-08-23-1471965566-4142786-irameditationcopy.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-08-23-1471965566-4142786-irameditationcopy-thumb.jpg,"That's me in the corner That's me in the spotlight Losing my religion -- R.E.M.If you've read my previous essays, you know that I am not an early adopter.Like you, I am a seeker. But, honestly, I fear change.OK, so you are probably already aware that there is a White Courtesy Phone that puts all seekers in contact with other beings vibrating at higher frequencies whenever we need better understandings of the learning and growth opportunities that the universe presents to us.As the saying goes, ""When the student is ready, the teacher shall appear.""Unfortunately, however, that teacher often appears in the form of a foreclosure notice, an automobile or bicycle accident, the human papillomavirus contracted from your spouse's new paramour, or getting fired from the only job you ever loved only to find out you were replaced by your assistant... and then sometime later a fellow seeker appears to explain why you were presented with that learning or growth opportunity.Thanks a bunch! Could you NOT have imparted these morsels of wisdom BEFORE the excruciatingly painful tragedy took place??? Along the spiritual path I've met some relatively remarkable fellow seekers. People who dislike me sometimes politely refer to me as a ""starf**ker"" (as if it doesn't get back to me); people who appreciate me say things like, ""Oh Ira, he's like a moth or small child... he's attracted to shiny objects."" I'm simply prepping you for a wee bit of namedropping - however, the people mentioned below really do fly in my orbit and most of them I met haphazardly at museums, meditation groups, kirtans, workshops and yoga classes. (Just imagine the names I could drop if I had gone to rehab!)Before I recount my Hindu Bar Mitzvah, let me outline the last two weeks of my life in Los Angeles - just to put everything into context.In between seeing patients, writing about mindfulness and yoga therapy, and preparing my workshops, here's a smattering of daily life in Santa Monica:July 14 - Lili Haydn is playing and Donna De Lory is going to sit in. Met Lili at a health food restaurant in 2004, she and her fiance Itan came to my last dinner party, and I truly love her music - she really is the Jimi Hendrix of violin. Met Donna in a yoga class and have seen her perform many times - she is awesome - I love to watch her perform!July 15 - Buddhist meditation with punk sage Noah Levine.July 17 - Lunch with yoga DVD producer Yariv Lerner who approached me in a yoga class because he enjoys my writing. Wow... thanks Yariv!July 19 - Nicole Daedone's OM (Orgasm Meditation). Daniel Pinchbeck invited me to dinner in Berkeley in 2009 and Nicole was seated next to me and then I chatted with her at our friend Dorka Keehn's booksigning in 2011 - have always wanted to watch her lend a hand to a damsel in distress. Mucho interesting.July 20th - Yoga with Felicia Tomasko then lunch at Hare Krishna temple - Jai Ma... Om Shanti... Yada Yada... Yabba dabba do....July 22 - Two hour somatic therapy session to try to get Ira back into his body (apparently sometimes he just floats off - ""Earth to Ira, Earth to Ira!"" many healers have been inclined to yell) and then full-moon kirtan featuring Govindas, Shiva Baum, David Watts, Momo Loudiyi and amazing food by Darshana Thacker. Since Gurmukh stopped serving dinner at her home after Sunday class, this kirtan is the most lovely, loving, and ego-less gathering left in LA. July 23 - Taught a couple of super-models yoga for the first time - they were delightful and wildly sophisticated and highly intelligent and intensely precocious and really really nice... and married and homeowners and young enough to be my children... I felt really old.July 25 - Get an email from an Academy Award nominated actress and lovely human being who I met at neighbor Tierney Gearon's house a few months ago - she is interested in attending my workshop in September. Will be intimidated and nervous if she actually shows up.July 26 - 90 minute soul retrieval session with a medicine woman - it goes swimmingly and the prognosis is ebulliently soulful. Then, like any diehard New Yorker, I rush to see ""Blue Jasmine"" opening day matinee. Woody Allen's best film in twenty years. Both Cate Blanchett and Sally Hawkins should win Academy Awards.(Intentionally leaving out amazing massages with Antonia Perensky, one sauna, amazing acupuncture sessions, and countless vegan meals at Golden Mean - because I don't want you to think that I'm indulgent or frittering away my life).OK, so now you people back on planet earth know how we woo-woo seekers out here in La-La land bide our free time.All of the above seeking notwithstanding, whenever anyone asks me my religion I still respond as I always have: ""I'm a Practicing Musician."" On the other hand, I know that when Hezbollah or Al-Qaeda takes over whatever airplane I am on, the next voice we hear will be ""Uh, would Mister Israel please step to the front of the plane....""OK, two more tidbits of information before I tell you about my Hindu Bar Mitzvah:1. Viewing the film ""One Track Heart,"" I was astonished for one particular reason that I believe was lost on many people: did anyone else notice that 95% of the followers of Neem Karoli Baaba - all of the major Das's (Krishna Das, Lama Surya Das, Ram Dass et al) - grew up in East Coast suburbs and were raised in the Jewish faith? Was there some sort of epidemic that caused young, highly educated, Jewish men to flock to India and explore Hinduism and Buddhism?2. David Lynch gave me a scholarship to study Transcendental Meditation in 2006 and like Jeff Goldblum's character in ""Annie Hall"" (I feel so stupid and cliche admitting this)... I lost my mantra. I can remember every course of every meal that I had at the Chateau Marmont during the past twenty years but I can't remember one monosyllabic sound. Pathetic. I made a commitment to practice TM twice a day for twenty minutes at a time and I didn't even last two months. I know that my TM mantra has an M sound and an R sound but no matter how hard I rattle my brain it won't come out.Now I'm ready to tell you about my Hindu Bar Mitzvah.Back in 2000 when my dear friend Sabine Chaloupy took me to see her guru Amma in New York City, let's just say I that was ready to pooh-pooh the whole thing.  Hugging? Really...? Are you serious? Whatever.... Never one to be dissuaded by throngs of gorgeous, hip, interesting, compassionate people and sumptuous meals, I have sat with Amma every time she has been within 100 miles of me during the last thirteen years. In particular, I cherish the time I spent at her ashram in San Ramon.I always receive darshan on the first morning when it is least crowded. This year was no exception. After darshan I spend as much time as possible meditating in her general vicinity. I haven't actually felt much during her hugs for the past ten years but I believe that her hug is akin to some kind of attunement that opens me up. Under the definition of 'neurotic' in the dictionary there is a picture of my cerebral cortex, but when I sit with Amma I can be peaceful and blissful for hours.However, for the past thirteen years I have resisted becoming a devotee because it means accepting Amma as my guru and making the same commitment that I made (and broke) to TM. I'm usually of the ""If-you-meet-the-Buddha-on-the-road-kill-him, No Guru No Method No Teacher"" ilk.I was meandering around on Saturday evening after the Devi Bhava ceremony when a volunteer approached me and asked if I wanted to take a mantra. I immediately recoiled but then considered how much my meditation practice could use a jump-start. ""Absolutely,"" I heard myself say and then was led to a small group of fellow seekers, given mantra instructions, and then led to Amma for her to whisper my mantra in my ear.Many of my professional colleagues pooh-pooh Amma and obviously I was somewhat skeptical if it took me thirteen years to take a mantra.Happy to report that I have been using the mantra for some time and can attest to its efficacy. Totally jump-started my meditation practice and took it to another level. Meditation is now actually enjoyable, less of a chore, and I honestly look forward to reciting my mantra. Weird - right?Thirteen years. My Hindu Bar Mitzvah.I am not an early adopter. "

Why? There's no shortage of lobster there, for one, and there's something about the sea breeze, the salty air, and the even saltier fishermen who you'll find at the best lobster shacks that make a Maine lobster roll not just an amazing sandwich, but a life-affirming experience (click here to see our picks for the Best Lobster Rolls in Maine). Thankfully, that experience isn't exclusive to Maine, and elsewhere in the country there are not only incredible lobster rolls to be eaten on patios overlooking the water, but at fine restaurants as well (Credit: Sam's Chowder House).Click here to see America's 20 Best Lobster Rolls Outside of MaineIf there's such thing as a perfect food, a great lobster roll could very well be it. First of all, it's lobster, one of the most gourmet -- and delicious -- foods in existence, democratized in a sense by removing it from the shell and sticking it inside a bun. The best lobster rolls are ones that boast heaping helpings of super-fresh lobster, kept in large chunks, served warm or cool, moistened with a little bit of mayo or butter, accented with some salt, pepper, and other spices of the chef's choosing (or none at all, but as long as the lobster isn't overpowered there's certainly room for creativity), nestled inside (and on top of and around) a split-top bun that's been buttered and toasted on a griddle. Aside from the sandwich itself, the eating experience is about as decadent as possible, and there are few foods that represent summer quite as much as a lobster roll. What's more, there are two major lobster roll styles to choose from, and both are arguably equally delicious: Maine-style, which is served cold with mayo, and Connecticut-style, which is served warm with butter.RELATED: The 40 Best Burgers in AmericaIn order to find the best lobster rolls outside of Maine, we searched far and wide for those that have the highest level of renown, but also ones that meet all the qualifications set forth above. While obviously the opportunity to eat your lobster roll on a picturesque dock overlooking a harbor filled with lobster trawlers is ideal, that's not a make-or-break criterion for a great lobster roll. Some mediocre lobster rolls are served in the most picturesque settings imaginable, and likewise, some of the country's best lobster rolls are served at restaurants with no water in sight.RELATED: Maine's 17 Best Lobster RollsOur journey across Lobster Roll America takes us to a restaurant in Los Angeles that serves a green curry-spiked lobster roll in a jet-black bun, an oyster bar in Philadelphia that ships both lobster and buns in from Maine daily, a shack in Minneapolis that goes through 3,000 pounds of lobster per week, and a sprawling patio in Austin, Texas, where super-fresh lobster rolls are served with a side of drawn butter. Not included in our list, unfortunately, is a study in opulence at New York's Manon, a lobster roll topped with uni and caviar, because it's not (yet) officially on the menu.Click here to join us on a journey through the best lobster rolls in America, outside of Maine.- Dan Myers, The Daily MealMore from The Daily Meal: America's 20 Best Steakhouses The Ultimate Ice Cream Sandwich Taste-Test America's Best Ribs 15 Healthiest Frozen Dinners"
