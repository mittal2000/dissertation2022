The rappers said they would go through with the lawsuit """"no matter what it costs or what it takes,"" eliciting cheering, cheers of ""Family,"" and even some crying. The ""Juggalos"" are best known for their elaborate, clownish make-up and annual ""Gathering of the Juggalos"" celebration. The FBI maintains, however, that subsets of the Juggalos ""exhibit gang-like behavior and engage in criminal activity in violence,"" according to the 2011 report.The FBI classifies the Juggalos as a ""loosely-organized hybrid gang."" The report defines a hybrid gang as being a ""non-traditional gang with multiple affiliations,"" and notes that most crimes committed by Juggalos ""involve simple assault, personal drug use and possession, petty theft, and vandalism.""While ""criminal Juggalo sub-sets"" have been identified in 21 states, Juggalos are only formally recognized as a gang in four states, according to the report. Almost a year later, ICP is fighting back against the classification. ""Let's get this straight, a Juggalo is not a gang member,"" Violent J, one member of the ICP duo, told Vice. Violent J went on to explain how the classification could seriously harm individual fans. He offered the hypothetical example of a fan who simply got an ICP-related tattoo many years ago. If such a fan were to get picked up for a minor offense like a speeding ticket, ""he's in the gang file… Suddenly, it ain't just somebody who fucked up, it's a gang member that fucked up, and they're getting a heavier sentence.""Some Juggalos have already suffered. Arizona man Shawn Wolf says his appreciation of ICP cost him custody of his son, according to Spin. ""The state of California flew to my house [to see if I was fit], and it's all ICP-decked out,"" Wolf said. ""Just because of that, I was kind of screwed.""Violent J added that the lawsuit wasn't just for their fans, but also for the employees of Psychopathic Records, the independent record label founded by ICP.""Some of these people... have been working here for 20 years,"" he said. ""That's their career now. They have kids, and wives, and husbands. Next thing you know, they're working for a gang.""ICP and Psychopathic Records have launched the website Juggalos Fight Back in order to help build their case against the FBI. "

Some of the legends on our list made it solely because of their athletic prowess. Some may not have been all-time greats in their respective sport -- but made the list because they broke down barriers, paving the way for future black athletes to follow.

I tell my golf-obsessed friends that what JPL accomplished is like teeing off at Saint Andrews and making a hole in one at Pebble Beach -- with the same ball. My JPL friends quarrel that the analogy is not exact. Perhaps, but it shows just how difficult the job was.What is more, Curiosity is no mere golf ball, or even golf cart. Rather, it is the size and weight of a car. At that size and weight, air bags won't do. So JPL created the sky crane, which set the rover down on the Martian surface as gently as a mother laying a baby in a crib.In the euphoria of success, it is easy to forget that the Mars Science Laboratory, aka Curiosity, originally planned to land 26 months ago. So rewind the tape about three years to the winter and spring of 2009. JPL and NASA faced a decision that was as emotionally difficult as it was intellectually easy. Stick with the original schedule and accept perhaps too much risk of failure, or wait for the next window of opportunity to go to Mars, and use the time to do all the work needed to ""retire"" the risk. For the managers, it meant taking the pain of delay, facing up to not meeting all the goals as scheduled, accepting a lower performance rating. Perhaps worst of all, they had to admit to themselves and each other that they had over-reached. It meant the humiliation of going back to NASA for more budget, and slipping developmental missions further out.""Rocket science"" is more than propulsion, navigation, and imagination. It is the discipline to analyze very complex things in order to identify every risk. Some risks can be designed out. Some can be reduced by a back-up system. Some risks are just simply there, in the ""critical path"" to mission success, too expensive to design out, too fundamental to eliminate. For those things, every item must be studied, tested, and re-studied and re-tested to make them as close to perfect as humans can achieve. The folks at JPL know this kind of rocket science. They invented much of it. They know what it takes -- not just in time and money, but in the attitude and dedication of the people doing the work. And they knew that if they stuck to their original schedule, they would come up short, by the standards they themselves developed and learned through many missions, both intoxicating successes and excruciating failures.As a member of the committee of the Caltech Board of Trustees that oversees JPL, I watched the team go through the analysis. But in the end, the call was easy -- take the lumps and do the right thing. Every one of us on the committee supported management and commended them for setting their emotions aside and going with their clear-headed, logical analysis of the situation. We offered all the personal and institutional support we could muster.The real measure of a team is not how it deals with success, but how it deals with adversity. JPL let out its collective breath, then re-planned and went back to work with a will. The delay added about 10 percent to the cost of the mission. It is harder to calculate how much risk was designed, tested, studied, and worried out.But the result, one week ago, speaks for itself. To do great things, it is not enough to dare and imagine. It takes the right stuff. Discipline. Judgment. Moral courage. And in that, Curiosity offers all of us a lesson that applies in every walk of life.The California Institute of Technology (Caltech) operates the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) under a contract with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

3,BUSINESS,Paul Ryan's Budget Proposals Have Drawn Much Criticism From Liberal Economists,Catherine New,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paul-ryan-budget_us_5bb2cdf0e4b0480ca65c6a4e,"Matt Miller, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, was also critical of the Roadmap in 2010, and wrote in",2012-08-12,"US Republican vice presidential candidate Wisconsin Representative Paul Ryan speaks during a campaign rally with US Republican presidential candidate former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney at Absolute Style in High Point, North Carolina, August 12, 2012.

AFP PHOTO / Saul LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/GettyImages)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2cdf02200004301dbb31c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Liberal economists have long been critical of Paul Ryan.The conservative Wisconsin congressman, who was announced as Mitt Romney's running mate on Saturday, first drew fire in 2010, when he pitched his federal budget plan as an alternative to President Obama's.Dubbed the ""Roadmap for America's Future,"" that plan and Ryan's subsequent budget proposals would do things like cut Medicaid and food stamp funding and create a two-tier tax rate system and a voucher-like system for Medicare. Economist Paul Krugman has been especially vocal in his assessment of Ryan's budget. In August 2010, he wrote a New York Times op-ed titled ""The Flimflam Man"" and critiqued Ryan's Roadmap, saying:That is, Mr. Ryan may speak about the deficit in apocalyptic terms, but even if you believe that his proposed spending cuts are feasible — which you shouldn’t — the Roadmap wouldn’t reduce the deficit. All it would do is cut benefits for the middle class while slashing taxes on the rich.Last year, Krugman criticized Ryan's budget proposals as ""ludicrous"" and ""cruel.""Matt Miller, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, was also critical of the Roadmap in 2010, and wrote in the Washington Post:The CBO says your road map would put spending at 22.2 percent of GDP in 2020 and 23.5 percent in 2040. With revenue capped at 19 percent, that means Paul Ryan stands for deficits that would be 3 percent to 4 percent of GDP for at least the next 30 years, which would balloon the debt by trillions, to 100 percent of GDP from 53 percent in 2009. If you're supposedly willing to make ""the hard choices,"" why wouldn't you balance the budget as soon as the economy is back on track? What kind of ""fiscal conservative"" has a half-century plan to balance the budget?Uwe E. Reinhardt, an economics professor at Princeton, criticized Ryan's health care plan. ""The specific proposals aside, does the Ryan plan offers anything to control overall health-care spending?"" he wrote in April 2011. ""No, nor does that appear to have been Mr. Ryan’s objective.""New York Times economist Joe Nocera also weighed in on Ryan's health care plan in May 2011 in an article called ""Don't Scorn Paul Ryan"":The Ryan plan, which would give seniors a fixed amount they can use to buy health insurance, would undoubtedly shift the cost burden over time from the government to seniors themselves, making health care far less affordable for millions of people. Ryan says that “empowering” health care consumers will help control costs, but that’s absurd: Medicare itself has far more pricing power than the people who actually need treatment.And in a Wall Street Journal op-ed in 2011, liberal economist and former vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Alan Blinder was highly critical of the GOP budget and Ryan's proposals:According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, about two-thirds of Mr. Ryan's so-called courageous budget cuts would come from programs serving low- and moderate-income Americans, while the rich would gain from copious tax cuts. That's courage? This reverse-Robin Hood redistribution is bad enough in the abstract. Coming on the heels of 30-plus years of rising inequality, it is breathtakingly mean-spirited. But was such class warfare necessary to make the budget numbers work?However, the conservative editorial page of the Wall Street Journal has supported Ryan, writing in August 2010:Mr. Ryan has one of the few credible plans for rationalizing the federal fisc, and his critics are so vicious because his candor exposes Washington's illusions about the entitlement state while offering a genuine alternative.  More recently, Nobel-prize winning economist and vocal liberal Joseph Stiglitz said in a June 2012 interview with Amy Goodman on ""Democracy Now"" that Ryan's plan ""is weakening our basic economic fiber.""While Romney is already working to distance himself from Ryan on certain budget topics, Glenn Hubbard, dean of Columbia Business School and an economic adviser to Romney, has endorsed both Romney's and Ryan's budget plans, and he drew comparisons between them in an interview with the Daily Ticker in March.""What both Rep. Ryan's and Gov. Romney's plans have in common is the notion of tax reform: broaden base and lower the rates, both corporate and individual,"" he said. ""[Both] reduce growth in government spending, particularly in entitlement spending the two plans are very similar."""

This used to be the way we kept our promise of economic progress and social mobility.  Has it really been so long that we've forgotten how to do that? Are we so determined to be myopic that we leave a skills gap to another generation?,2012-08-12,"In this Tuesday, July 17, 2012, file photo, business employment specialist Linda Reynolds, right, helps job searcher D'Andre Preston at WorkSource Oregon in Tualatin, Ore. The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits rose by 34,000 last week, a figure that may have been skewed higher by seasonal factors. Applications for benefits increased to a seasonally adjusted 386,000, the Labor Department said Thursday, July 19, 2012. The gain followed a drop of 24,000 the previous week and was the biggest jump since April 2011. (AP Photo/Rick Bowmer, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2cdf2240000510055aaaa.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Millions of Americans have cycled through a series of ""miracle"" diets (I'm one of them). Most promise quick but lasting results. And often one diet's sacred premise is another's sacrilege. After a while you may (like me) conclude that the radical weight loss solution is... exercise more and eat less.Our thinking on jobs has become a little like our thinking on diets. It has certainly provided a bunch of empty calories to the national discourse. The problem is that, in our zeal for magic fixes, we sometimes ignore obvious choices. Don't get me wrong: We've generated some great new ideas for finding the right training programs for employees, and matching them with the right jobs. But, with due respect for these new ideas, are we forgetting a few old ones? Let's not just answer the question about what new ways we can come up with to address unemployment. Let's question the question: Is there anything out there that can help solve our jobs crisis and also propel us to the 21st-century version of broad-based progress that we enjoyed in the middle part of the 20th? Can we use the overlooked architecture of the last century's prosperity to lay the foundation for success in this one?There is indeed. In fact there are two powerful forces that could do great good. First of all, there's the series of economic supports that kick in to help the needier among us: the Earned Income Tax Credit, TANF, SNAP ( better known as food stamps), Medicaid, and other federal and state programs.These form a social Safety Net designed to keep the hard-working but hard-up from going hungry or homeless. It's obviously far from perfect, but it's considerably better than nothing. When properly used, it can make the difference between giving up and getting ahead.What can the venerable Safety Net possibly have to do with job creation? As it turns out, a great deal. Because we can harness the Safety Net to work in tandem with the second old idea at play here: the great American community college system. Americans have benefited from community colleges for decades. They became a critical vehicle for teaching the skills we needed to thrive in the golden age of what we fondly call the American Century.Community colleges remain a vital venue for equipping us with the skills required in 21st-century jobs, as Matt Sledge noted in his recent post (""Carmakers, Community Colleges, Launch Curriculum for Skilled Workers"").So why do we still have an unemployment crisis? Why do we still have a 3.4 million jobs-to-skills deficit that contributes to it?One major reason is that more than half of the nation's 12 million+ community college students end up dropping out. They don't drop out because they're baffled by the coursework or bored by the prospect of success. Many drop out simply because they can't afford to stay in. Community colleges are an attractive option for people whose families don't have the means to spring for the (now stratospheric) tuition rates of the alternatives. But that means many community college students have to hold down a job or two while they try to complete their studies. Before they know it, subsisting gets in the way of their degree. They literally have to choose between groceries and graduation.It need not be this way. Millions of these students are eligible for the help that the Safety Net provides. But a staggering number of them don't realize that they are, or in any event don't avail themselves of all the Safety Net's benefits. Studies show that even a small amount of additional help greatly increases the ability of community college students to stay in school. Why not use the Safety Net's funds to provide this help?We still think of the Safety Net as something to protect people who've fallen on hard times from falling farther and harder still. It's certainly that, and we should be under no illusions about how much worse off millions of Americans would be in this crisis without it.But it can also be much more than that. It can be a springboard from which people in a tough economic climate can rise up to meet the qualifications for, and master the skills of, a demanding global job market. Billions of Safety Net dollars could be redeployed to this end. Connecting students to these resources is not rocket science. It's a logistics problem that we can readily solve. And solving it means equipping millions more students with the job skills they need, and giving them a shot at sustainable economic security.So what on earth are we waiting for? This used to be what it meant to be American. This used to be the way we kept our promise of economic progress and social mobility. Has it really been so long that we've forgotten how to do that? Are we so determined to be myopic that we leave a skills gap to another generation? We have a straightforward chance to close that gap and reopen the doors to social mobility. This is the kind of situation for which the hackneyed phrase ""win-win"" was invented. Maybe it's because it's too obvious -- staring us in the face, just like the advice our doctor gave us to quit the fad diet and head for the sit-up bench and salad bar.Winston Churchill (reliably good for a quote) once said: ""Americans can always be counted on to do the right thing... after they have exhausted all other possibilities."" Let's prove him right. A better-educated workforce, filling the millions of high-skills jobs that our 21st-century economy creates? Sounds to me as American as (a nutritious) apple pie."

I suddenly found myself a single mom trying to uncover who I was again separate from my husband and was catapulted back into this thing called ""dating."" I had a closet full of oversized black ""mommy"" tops, a bunch of nursing bras and neutral-colored Birkenstock sandals. Not a very appealing image. More importantly, I wasn't feeling attractive and I didn't know how to give signals that I was even interested in men. The last date I remembered having was going to a toga fraternity party with my college boyfriend. Boy, were things different! I didn't know if I would ever get my groove back and feel like a sexy, charming and dateable woman again. This is where my journey began and it's why I'm so passionate about helping men and women rediscover who they are, gain confidence and attract love.Confidence is the number one element both men and women find attractive in each other. When you feel confident, you attract love and opportunity in your life. However, feeling secure when it comes to dating after divorce is easier said than done. One of the problems is that your identity has been linked with your spouse for so long that you forget who you are separate from that person. Despite its challenges, if you feel good about yourself and know what you want, finding love and dating can be easy. Getting back out there takes time, but there are a few things you can do to get started and regain some of those dating skills that have been dormant. Follow these easy tips so you can be on your way towards feeling more confident and charming.Rediscover your passions: Do you remember all of the activities you enjoyed before you met your spouse? Often couples meld into each other's lives to complement one another, which means sometimes giving up things you enjoy. It's time to dig up the things that once made you who you are and get involved again. Perhaps there are hobbies, places to travel or extracurricular activities that you couldn't do with your ex-spouse. Reconnecting with your passions will help you find the things that make you happy, focus on yourself and even meet other likeminded people.Stop, slow down and focus on you: Right after divorce, many people try to numb the pain by quickly getting involved with someone else. That, however, is just a band-aid over a wound that needs time to heal. Slow down and don't worry about getting into another relationship right away; take the time to get to know who you are again. Think of it this way -- if you're running a marathon and you want to get to the finish line, you can't sprint the whole way. You'll get hurt and fall short. Rather, you need to train, get your body in shape, run at a decent pace and take notice of your surroundings. That is what The Art of Charm helps clients do -- train for the marathon so they can feel good about themselves and get to the finish line. Observe your environment. Create an energy that invites people towards you. For example, do you know if a women is looking at you? Make eye contact with and smile at women who are noticing you. Get rid of your tunnel vision!Know your strengths: Most clients bring me a laundry list of what kind of woman they want and what qualities they must have. It's great to think about the kind of partner you would like, but it's more important to understand who you are first. Instead of focusing on the woman, focus on you. I tell my clients to write a list of their personality traits, all the things they are good at in their profession, what they offer in a relationship, physical traits, etc. This can be challenging for a lot of people, but I find that once people recognize their own strengths, getting what they want is a lot easier. This exercise also helps you come from a place of confidence so that when you are feeling anxious and uneasy about dating, you think of all the fantastic qualities you have and the insecurities go away. Knowing your strengths and accomplishments will also assist in getting clarity on who deserves you!Have fun: It sounds so simple, but you need to let go of the urgency of finding that perfect partner right away. Interviewing several women on dates can be freeing and make dating fun. Find your inner child again by being playful and fun. Avoid interrogating your first date by asking a hundred questions to see if she meets your criteria for marriage. Instead, laugh, share stories, keep it light and ignite passion. Make her want more by showing the fun, playful side of you so that she'll want a second date. You are not jumping into a relationship with anyone on a first meeting so just kick back and have fun. You'll have plenty of time to get to know her if she is the right one.Take Charge: A lot of anxiety, fear and insecurity may get brought out when returning to the dating scene after divorce. Because of this dynamic, it's really important to do things to feel good about yourself. Women especially are attracted to men who can take a stance and have an ""alpha"" presence. So if you are a man, plan the date for the woman. Find out what her passions are, her favorite food or something playful that will make her laugh. By doing this, you will show that you are able to listen to her and she will feel that you are the kind of man who will take care of her. Of course there are so many other ways to regain dating confidence after divorce. The whole point is to slow down and take baby steps until you feel you are in condition to run the marathon. Pace it out, enjoy who you are, have fun and you WILL get to the finish line!"

Just wondering.,2012-08-11,Beautiful green eyes of a bride looking over the grooms shoulder,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c20a31f00005100211a5c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Have you or your fiancé slept with any of the ""friends"" on your guest list? And if yes, do you and your fiancé both know about the prior sexual relationship, and did you make a conscious decision together to invite your ex-boyfriends, lovers, and friends with benefits to your wedding? Does anybody else attending your wedding know that you and the guy they're seated beside used to do more than just Algebra homework together down in his basement after school? Just wondering. Let me begin, as a wedding professional, by advising you not to invite former bedmates to a destination wedding. I've seen some seriously awkward scenes go down late at night on terraces of Caribbean villas and hotels. ""My Best Friend's Wedding"" ain't no joke, my friends. But if you're getting married back in the real world and you're having a large wedding, the situation may be unavoidable. Your mom is totally going to put your neighbors on the guest list. And if you had neighbors like I had neighbors... well, it can be awkward, to say the least.Picture the drunk, hysterical girl we found sobbing behind the bar cabana because now that her lifelong bff was marrying ""that witch,"" life will never be the same again. Um, she's right. But I still walked her away from the wedding and talked her off the ledge. At another wedding, there was the jealous, older, not-very-attractive sister of the bride who spent all weekend acting like she was at a funeral. She even wore black. Apparently, the groom was hers first. He kissed her when they were eight. Ridiculous, right? But she's still single and now she's watching him marry her sister so the context and timeline don't matter. The bride, in that case, wisely opted to skip having a wedding party lest she be trapped into an even more uncomfortable situation with her sister as MoH.I can honestly say I did invite a couple of my exes to my wedding reception back in DC eight years ago, but neither of them attended. That was just fine. I attended both of their weddings, however, and I'm here to tell you it was uncomfortable. In one case, a former boyfriend I'd remained close to got married when he and his fiancé were in our area visiting his parents. My then-soon-to-be-husband Bill and I attended the wedding together, and at first it wasn't too weird because we'd gone out as couples together a few times. My ex-boyfriend lives on the other side of the world now and has for many years, but he was one of my best friends and the love of my life for part of high school and college. It was sort of emotional watching him exchange vows with somebody else, despite the fact that I liked her a lot and, most importantly, I didn't want to marry anybody but Bill. Still, it's hard to watch somebody you once imagined spending the rest of your life with get married to somebody else. Especially when everybody at the wedding knows your history with the bride or groom. But here's the most awkward part: on the dance floor, his dad told me he had always thought he'd be dancing with me as his new daughter-in-law someday. Painfully awkward.So when is it okay, and when it is not okay, to invite former paramours to your wedding? I think first and foremost, you eliminate anybody with whom you've shared any form of scandal. People should be talking about your future at your wedding, not your past. Also, eliminate anybody who isn't happy that you're getting married. And anybody that your fiancé doesn't like or want at his or her wedding. That's probably the first thing you need to do -- this wedding is about both of you. If, after you skinny it down that far, you find you still have people on the list who have carnal knowledge of one (or both) of you, you have to use your judgment about who to invite.It's perfectly okay to decide to exclude anybody from your wedding for any reason -- especially having that sort of history together. Just be prepared to explain it to the person if it's somebody who is close enough to you for hurt feelings. Many of us have a lifelong bff we've hooked up with on some drunken occasion. Depending on how you phrase it, somebody from your past who truly loves you will completely understand why they can't be there on your big day, and your friendship will survive it. Also, any of your former lovers who are married now know what this sorting process is like, so they require less explanation. Everybody understands you're trying to avoid a potentially awkward situation.Nobody wants drama at their wedding so don't invite anybody who shouldn't be there. You don't need to prove anything to anyone. Remember that you aren't the only one who is going to feel awkward depending on who you invite -- let me tell you how weird it is to make idle chitchat with the bride's ex-boyfriend in the receiving line. And who are you going to seat him with? Again -- your wedding is about your future. Leave the past behind you. If you're not ready to do that, maybe you're not ready to get married yet.Until next time, happy wedding planning from Weddings in Vieques and Weddings in Culebra!Sandy"
14,SCIENCE,Oscar Pistorius' Prosthetic Legs: Do They Give Him an Advantage Over Other Olympic Runners?,"Rami Hashish, PhD, DPT, Contributor

(AP Photo/Anja Niedringhaus)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baeb05d2100002501c6eecf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Despite finishing last in a semifinal of the Olympic 400 meters, South African Oscar Pistorius ran himself into the hearts of the public and engrained himself in the history books as the first double amputee to compete in the Olympics. Affectionately referred to as ""the fastest man with no legs"" or ""the Blade Runner,"" Pistorius competes with the aid of bioengineered carbon-fiber prosthetics. While there is overwhelming admiration for his heroics, there is a faction of dissenters who believe that Pistorius is at an advantage over his able-bodied peers. Biomechanist Roger Kram of the University of Colorado and biophysicist Hugh Herr of MIT led a team of scientists to investigate this perceived advantage. It was stated in their report, published in The Journal of Applied Physiology (JAP), that Pistorius was ""physiologically similar but mechanically dissimilar"" to an abled-bodied runner. So does that mean he's at an advantage? Let's examine the findings. PhysiologicallyMuscle-tendon units (such as the calf-Achilles, which Pistorius lacks) are viscoelastic. In other words, they demonstrate both viscous and elastic properties when subjected to deformation. Basically, the more viscous a material, the harder it is to move. Carbon-fiber prosthetics, however, act more akin to something that is elastic and thus demonstrate relatively faster recoil. In other words, when stretched, or when a force is applied (such as pushing off the ground), it returns back to its original state much quicker than something that is more viscous (such as muscle). As explained to Scientific American by executive vice president of research and development of Össur, the Icelandic company that manufactures Pistorius' blades, ""when the user is running, the prosthesis's J curve is compressed at impact, storing energy and absorbing high levels of stress that would otherwise be absorbed by a runner's ankle, knee, hip and lower back."" Thus, thanks to this elastic-like property, the use of blades would theoretically result in improved energy efficiency. In fact, this was found to be true, as a 2007 study out of Cologne, Germany, Pistorius was found to use 25-percent less energy than his peers. The report out of JAP, however, reported negligible changes in energy expenditure. The inconsistencies in the findings are attributed to a disparity in study methodology, leading Kram to state that Pistorius' ""rate of energy consumption was lower than an average person but comparable to other high-caliber athletes.""MechanicallyThe reduced viscosity of the blade relative to muscle, as well as its lightness, explains why Pistorius demonstrates faster leg swings than his able-bodied peers. In fact, in a competing report to the JAP study (conduct by physiologist Peter Weyland of Southern Methodist University and biomechanist Matthew Bundle of the University of Wyoming), it was found that the carbon-fiber blades allow Pistorius to reposition his limbs 15.7-percent faster than the most recent world record holders in the 100-meter dash. This enables for a 15- to 30-percent increase in sprint speed. To make matters even more partisan, the structure of the blade appears to have a longer functional lever arm than that of the human foot (i.e., the point of contact is further away from the axes of rotation -- lower extremity joints -- than the typical contact point of the foot). This allows for a larger generation of torque when an identical magnitude of force is applied (torque = force x lever arm). The catch-22, however, is that Pistorius does not exert as much force during push-off from the ground as an able-bodied runner. While this would appear to negate any advantage that he may possess, attributed to the springy, elastic-like structure of the blades, Pistorius requires less than half of the muscle force and 20-percent less ground forces to attain the same running speeds as able-bodied runners. ConclusionSo, when you add it up, you get a runner who has light-weight, spring-like legs that allow for more efficient movement, and a reduced requirement of force production. The question is therefore not whether he possesses an advantage but how much of an advantage is unfair. Regardless of the debate, Pistorius' remarkable journey, and the heart and spirit he has demonstrated, embody what the Olympic Games stand for. The sight of a legless sprinter utilizing the technology of today to compete in the oldest athletic event this world knows captured the hearts and minds of people of all religions, cultures, and creeds. I salute you, Oscar Pistorius -- even if you are at an advantage."

For South African sprinter and double amputee Oscar Pistorius, the path to competition was a Herculean effort. Known as ""Blade Runner"" because of his J-shaped carbon-fiber prosthetics, Pistorius has captured the support of fans around the world and has a loyal fan base in our catastrophically combat wounded from Iraq and Afghanistan. To our wounded warriors, Pistorius is not only a role-model, but a tremendous ambassador to those unfamiliar with amputees and prosthetics. Cheering him the past two weeks as he defies preconceived barriers about his anatomical structure is both exciting and hopeful for our returning wounded. Running, however, was a small hurdle compared to being accepted and qualified to compete.The International Association of Athletics Federations, the governing body for track and field, ultimately qualified him for the London games after thwarting his efforts for Beijing in 2008. The balk at letting him compete was due to examining his differences to determine if there was a competitive edge. Fortunately, the IAAF recognized that Pistorius got to this level through extreme dedication, hard work, and perseverance, not because of a ""handicap advantage."" Oxymoron? Somehow, there are still those who think not having legs and running on prosthetics give him an advantage. Certainly, these people have never actually seen someone run on prosthetics.Our combat wounded amputees find great strength and inspiration from Pistorius. These wounded vets, in many ways like Oscar Pistorius, are seeking acceptance on their merits. Unlike any previous military conflict, we have more surviving severely injured returning home. Nearly 47,000 U.S. service members have been wounded in Iraq or Afghanistan in the past decade, and approximately 1,500 are amputees. Almost 35 percent of them have lost more than one limb, including double, triple and even quadruple amputees -- something unheard of in prior wars. Fortunately, body armor, field medicine, and the joint military service team have contributed not only to saving lives, but enabling the possibility for these men and women to achieve whatever goals they may have.Working closely with doctors, nurses, and therapists, I spent my final months in the Marine Corps supporting the recovery, rehabilitation, and reintegration of our wounded into the community. Their focus to surmount the myriad daily challenges of life with prosthetics was absolutely inspiring. Whether it was bathing, dressing, walking, or even running, our wounded service members' grit and determination motivated all supporting their efforts. At each milestone, acceptance of their ""new normal"" and desire to pursue the next goal humbled each of us.Watching Pistorius defy odds and compete in London reminds me of the numerous severely combat wounded I've served with at the military hospitals in D.C. These veterans can more readily associate with everything Pistorius has accomplished. Certainly they would love to cheer him to the medal stand, but the fact that he qualified and is competing with the best in the world is already an immense accomplishment. Moreover, his demonstrated resolve to win over skeptics with his natural, unaided ability is what makes the Olympics so endearing. In the coming years, more and more combat wounded veterans and amputees will enter society and seek free market opportunities. Hopefully, we can focus on their different abilities and not their disabilities. The victory in this subtle perspective toggle will provoke not only the best in our wounded warriors, but in us too."

Every two years, the participating athletes show the world the very best of the human spirit, inspiring us with their enormous sense of teamwork, skill and competition. For 17 days, we cheer the greatest achievements in sport -- sharing in the exultation of unbelievable feats and empathizing with others in the agony of disappointment and defeat.The Olympic Games are unparalleled in their ability to break down barriers. I can't help but feel proud of what the Olympic Movement is able to achieve on a global scale, uniting athletes from every corner of the world and giving them an opportunity to compete on a level playing field. The Olympic Movement is empowering individuals from every walk of life, making a difference in the lives of men and women, boys and girls across the globe. Further, I am thrilled to see that for the first time in Olympic history, women are competing in every sport at the 2012 Games in London. As I wrote prior to the onset of the Games and again following the opening ceremony, I draw great parallels between elite Olympic athletes and the world's finest entrepreneurs. Many Olympians and entrepreneurs are familiar with my 10 secrets to entrepreneurial success. Now that the 2012 Summer Olympics are coming to a close, I would like to highlight four more of these insights and explain how athletes follow an entrepreneurial path to achieve greatness.Gut Instinct Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt reminds me of the importance of following your gut instinct. Initially his country had him training for longer distance races, but Usain's gut led him to train for events where he excelled, driving his change to the 100- and 200-meter sprint races. Now, for the second Olympic Games in a row, he has left us all in amazement.Additionally, the most remarkable Olympic 'gut instinct moment' occurred in 2008 when Michael Phelps won the gold medal in the 200-meter butterfly. When his goggles filled up with water with about 100 meters to go, he had to rely on counting his strokes and following his gut instinct to be aware of where he was and compensate for the lack of sight. Of course, Phelps was more than prepared for that scenario. His coach, Bob Bowman, had him practice with water-filled goggles so that when the time came for him to rely on his gut instinct in competition, he was ready.Entrepreneurs can relate. We have to rely on the same gut instinct that compels us to react without hesitation. Like Phelps and other athletes have shown, panic is not an option. We must remain focused on our goal, or chart a new course, whether that is a new business venture or breaking a world record.Flexible but Persistent I would be remiss not to mention the U.S. women's gymnastics team, which overcame the odds to win the first Olympic gold medal for the United States in the all-around competition since 1996. This year's team is comprised of so many remarkable teenagers, each of whom undoubtedly have the capacity and wherewithal to become successful entrepreneurs if they so choose. In fact, they don't even have to look outside their sport for inspiration and guidance if they choose to make that transition.Nadia Comaneci arguably remains the all-time greatest gymnast and continues to exemplify the utmost flexibility and persistence throughout her post-Olympic journey. Comaneci won five gold medals and was the first female gymnast ever awarded a perfect score of 10 in an Olympic gymnastics event, earning seven perfect 10 scores in the 1976 Montreal Games. Today, Nadia inspires us with her charitable endeavors, relentless support of women in sports and her altruistic work on the boards of directors for the International Special Olympics and the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Her flexible approach to the world's problems carries through in her persistent ability to triumph against all odds.Last February, I was proud to honor her achievements at the International Olympic Committee's World Conference on Women and Sport. Comaneci still has that grace and amazing presence that defined her Olympic feats many years ago. But it is her entrepreneurial spirit and philanthropic work that inspires all of us today.Deploying The Right Team Each team -- whether athletic or business-oriented -- is comprised of individual excellence and the collective expertise necessary to complete the mission. However, as your vision evolves or competitors change, you may be forced to change your roster to make your team ideally suited for a win. Just look at the U.S. women's water polo team, an inspiring group of athletes that won the first-ever gold medal for their country on the back of a 19-year-old sensation. Maggie Steffens scored an astounding five goals in the team's 8-5 win over Spain, elevating her team to greatness just weeks before she heads off for her first year at Stanford this fall. ""I'd say she was the best player in the world in this tournament,"" the team's coach Adam Krikorian said after the game. ""But there's no way we do this without everyone else.""Just like Olympians who compete as a cohesive unit, entrepreneurs need a team that is smart and agile. Otherwise it won't be able to grow and adapt, as your business needs change. I learned the importance of applying these entrepreneurial insights to sports when I was a co-owner of the Seattle SuperSonics. Athletes and entrepreneurs are acutely aware of how quickly things can change when winning streaks turn into losses. It takes the right team and courageous leadership to put key responsibilities in the hands of those best equipped to continue winning. And often, that winning comes with change.Diversity As The Key To Success The title of the world's greatest athlete is generally reserved for the Olympic decathlon champion -- and for good reason. This 100-year-old event is a two-day competition, comprised of 10 events and requires athletes to focus on executing each and every discipline to the best of their ability. When all is said and done, the decathletes standing on the podium with gold, silver and bronze medals hanging around their necks have shown extreme athletic prowess to be competitive and nimble, expert and diverse. Not to mention enormous strength and determination through every cell of their bodies. Even Usan Bolt who said, ""I am a living legend. Bask in my glory,"" when asked who is the world's greatest athlete, replied: ""I'm a great athlete, but to do 10 events, especially the 1,500 ... I've got to give it to him,"" referring to U.S. gold-medal decathlete Ashton Eaton.It has been an exciting two weeks. As I turn off the remote control after Sunday night's Closing Ceremony and focus on my entrepreneurial endeavors, I am reminded that the parallels of sport and entrepreneurism exist at every level. Tennis is a game of strategic movement and response. Golf is a game of risk. The list goes on and on. And with that, I have an entire year's worth of entrepreneurial enlightenment ahead of me. Thank goodness I won't have to wait until the 2014 Winter Olympic Games in Russia..."
