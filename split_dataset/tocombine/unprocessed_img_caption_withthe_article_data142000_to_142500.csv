It's the production that counts, and there have been entirely too many to count.",2013-09-28,"This theater image released by Jeffrey Richards Associates shows Cherry Jones, left, and Zachary Quinto during a performance of ""The Glass Menagerie."" The production opens on Sept. 26, 2013 at the Booth Theatre in New York. (AP Photo/Jeffrey Richards Associates, Michael J. Lutch)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2662a3c000066000c130a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the great things about the New York theatre is its market value, aimed at an audience so vast and eclectic that revivals of old classics are every bit as welcome as the most innovative of new experiments. Until you suffer through the dismal autopsy of a durable classic as poorly conceived and amateurishly executed as the latest Broadway resuscitation of Tennessee Williams' 1944 play The Glass Menagerie, with the erstwhile Cherry Jones giving the worst performance of her career. Then you might as well be attending a production at some community theatre in Baton Rouge or Boca. Everyone laments the paucity of originality on the New York stage these days, but this misery is so bad it gives even second-rate revival fever a bad rap.Since the famously tortured playwright's second play -- a gauzy, poetic memory piece about the Mississippi-born writer's mordant life working in a shoe factory in St. Louis to help his bitter, fluttery fading Southern belle of a mother cope with survival after the disappearance of his father, a loser who worked for the telephone company and ""fell in love with long distance""--there isn't much need to ponder the contents of the play itself. Is there anyone who pretends to know anything about the theatre who has not seen or read The Glass Menagerie? It's the production that counts, and there have been entirely too many to count. Tennessee is the narrator Tom (which was his real name) whose psychologically damaged sister Laura is a stand-in for his real sister Rose, who was forced to undergo a pre-frontal lobotomy. Both of them spend their time trying to escape from their domineering mother Amanda (fashioned after Tennessee's love-hate relationship with his mother Edwina) in different ways -- Tom smoking on the fire escape and running away nightly to movies and gay bars, already paving the way for Tennessee's future prophecy of debauchery and alcoholism, and Laura hiding from reality in her collection of miniature glass animals and old phonograph records. Circling around them, babbling in porous circles, is the indestructible poseur of a mother, a mantle of frustration, trying to make a man out of her dream son and a femme fatale of her hopelessly catatonically shy daughter. The second act centers on the evening when Tom reluctantly surrenders to his mother's incessant badgering and brings home a ""gentleman caller"" for Laura. The evening, like the play, ends in disaster.Calculating, exasperating, verbose, and preposterously silly, Amanda is an unpleasant dragon of mother but also a fatal lure for magnificent actresses who cannot wait to tame her in their own image. I wasn't around when Laurette Taylor made history in the role of Amanda Wingfield in the original 1946 Broadway production, but I have seen everyone in the role from the heartbreaking Julie Harris down to the pretentious, miscast Katharine Hepburn, and not one has been so blindly, blatantly, bombastically boring. This Amanda is not just another steel magnolia; she's a marauding Mack truck with a Southern accent so phony you can't understand more than three words out of every sentence. She sounds like she's got a mouth full of wet toilet paper. When she flutters into the Act Two dinner table scene wearing an ante-bellum gown from a Civil War cotillion, the audience gasped, and so did I. Instead of an addled old trout, she had transformed herself into an escaped mental patient. Whatever else Amanda is, she is not an animated Gone With the Wind cartoon.Hardly in the same vein as previous tender-angry Toms such as Montgomery Clift and Arthur Kennedy, Zachary Quinto (best known as Spock in Star Trek) appears to be both affected and infected by his co-star. With a droning, singsong nasality that lulls you into the arms of Morpheus, he's the most artificial Tom since John Malkovich in the 1987 flop movie directed by Paul Newman. The two best performances in the production surface in the sensitive interplay between Laura and the Gentleman Caller. Celia Keenan-Bolger has an indelible sweetness that inspires sympathy, and she doesn't overdo the crippled limp. Brian J. Smith, a real actor with the natural grace of a boxer even when he's playing awkwardness and guilt, restores the hysterics to something resembling real life. This is harder than it sounds, since the actors are sucked into the vortex of the ugliest set in any production of The Glass Menagerie I have ever seen. ""Designed"" is not the word I would use to describe it, but Bob Crowley, a usually learned man, is credited as ""scenic and costume design"". His stage is a hole of blackness. No sets, no flats, no walls, no doors -- just a ratty sofa and a series of cages rising to the ceiling which I guess are supposed to represent a St. Louis tenement fire escape.   But it's not the bleak minimalism that robs the play of so much of its poetry. It's the bogus posturing, fake drawls and insincere eye rolling right out of first-year drama school that drove me mad. So stylized and surreal that they even pantomime setting the dinner table and drinking from a coffee cup, it reeks of cornball pretense. The Gentleman Caller scene comes to life because it's the best written scene in the play, but also because director John Tiffany shows, for the first time, the value of knowing when to leave good actors alone. He certainly doesn't know what to do with Cherry Jones. She flaps around like a spastic penguin, even when she's supposed to be showing us the pathetic and vulnerable side of Amanda, living in the past, anointing herself with daydreams of girlhood beaux, picnics and yellow jonquils. I have admired her immensely elsewhere, especially in her Tony-award winning performances in Doubt and The Heiress. That Cherry Jones, an icon of nuance, control and emotional sensibility, is nowhere to be found here.Trying to bolster Laura's lack of confidence, the Gentleman Caller says, ""I may be disappointed, but I am not discouraged."" After this sorry production of The Glass Menagerie, I am both. It's downright dismaying to see an American classic ruined."

The Buckeyes host Wisconsin in their Big Ten opener at Ohio Stadium, and it will be interesting to see if Miller has to shake off any rust early in the game. Kenny Guiton filled in beautifully while Miller was shelved, so head coach Urban Meyer knows that he could go back to the ""hot hand"" if Miller struggles at all. As it is we likely will see Guiton in the game at some point after the redshirt senior earned back-to-back Big Ten offensive player of the week honors. I expect Miller to remain the starter, but will more intrigue ensue Saturday night if he is at all shaky?Arizona RB Kaâ€™Deem Carey and Washington RB Bishop Sankey: The two best running backs in the Pac-12 square off Saturday in Seattle, as the Wildcats and the Huskies meet in a key Pac-12 clash. Carey is averaging 149.5 rushing yards per game, while Sankey is at 148.7. And both are gaining nearly 7 yards per rush and have four scores on the ground. The Huskies have the edge at quarterback with Keith Price, so Carey will be a big factor in whether Rich Rodriguez's squad could steal a road win in what will be a raucous environment.Florida QB Tyler Murphy: With Jeff Driskel lost for the season with a broken fibula, Murphy will now have to run the offense for the first time in his Gators career after being buried on the depth chart the last three years. He considered transferring and never wanted to change positions, and he now is finally the No. 1 QB in Gainesville. Defense and special teams will be leaned on with Murphy's inexperience against a brutal upcoming schedule, but the new starting signal-caller still needs to be productive, efficient and turnover-free as well. He'll have a chance to get his feet weet as a starter this week against Kentucky, but it is in Lexington.Ole Miss RB Jeff Scott: If the Rebels are going to beat Alabama at Bryant-Denny Stadium and notch their third impressive road victory of the young season, Scott needs to be productive on the edges against the Crimson Tide defense. Quarterback Bo Wallace has to play turnover-free, and Scott needs to resemble the running back that is averaging 9.4 yards per carry. Even if he finds difficulty running against the 'Bama front, Scott can be a weapon on special teams or lined up in the slot. I expect Rebels head coach Hugh Freeze to line him up all over the field in hopes of finding a mismatch against the Nick Saban and Kirby Smart defense.TCU RBs Waymon James and B.J. Catalon: Another pair of running backs makes this week's list because of their importance to a Horned Frogs offense that has not been in sync all season long. With Casey Pachall hurt, Trevone Boykin is the No. 1 QB. But neither Pachall nor Boykin has really looked comfortable this year, and it doesn't really seem as if TCU has an offensive identity after three contests. When a team has two backs such as James and Catalon, that needs to be the focus. The Frogs, after establishing the run, can then take advantage of Boykin's athleticism. It just seems as if they are trying to force Boykin to be a traditional passer, which he isn't.Dave Miller, the college football editor and writer for the National Football Post, is on Twitter @Miller_Dave."

5,FOOD & DRINK,Collard Greens and Sweet Corn Buttermilk Cakes With Sumac-Sour Cream,"Viviane Bauquet Farre, Contributor
Chef, food and wine writer, photographer",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/collard-greens_us_5b9d8b50e4b03a1dcc895455,These savory pancakes are delectable as an hors d'oeuvre or finger food.,2013-09-27,2013-09-25-IMG_6878Collardgreensandsweetcornbuttermilkcakeswithsumacsourcream.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-09-25-IMG_6878Collardgreensandsweetcornbuttermilkcakeswithsumacsourcream.jpg,"I think of collard greens as the most muscular member of the leafy green family. Indeed, even after being exposed to heat for a good period of time, the leaves remain quite firm. This, of course, makes collard greens an unusually versatile green veggie!For these bite-sized pancakes, though, the texture of the collard greens needs to be more refined. So I resorted to cutting them in super-thin slices. This way they yield their wonderful crunch without compromising the delicateness of the tiny pancakes.Moreover, the collard greens acquire a distinct mineral flavor when sautÃ©ed. Both the buttermilk and the sweet corn come to balance that a bit, and to add a delightful sweetness to the cakes. The dollop of sour cream infused with the tangy sumac adds a marvelous touch.These savory pancakes are delectable as an hors d'oeuvre or finger food. But served with the sumac-infused sour cream on the side, they make a wonderful appetizer too.Who says your collard greens should only be eaten stewed?!Collard Greens and Sweet Corn Buttermilk Cakes with Sumac-Sour CreamMakes 16 bite-sized pancakes or serves 4 Active time: 40 minFor the sour cream 1/3 cup sour cream 1 teaspoon ground sumacFor the collard greens 8 oz (225 g) collard greens (5 large leaves) 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil 1/8 teaspoon ground cayenne 2 garlic cloves - skinned and finely chopped 1/4 teaspoon sea saltFor the cakes 1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon sea salt freshly ground black pepper to taste 2 extra large eggs 1/2 cup cultured buttermilk 1 large ear fresh corn - husk removed and kernels shaved off the cob 1 1/2 tablespoons unsalted butterStep 1: Place the sour cream and sumac in a small bowl. Stir well and refrigerate until ready to use.Step 2: Rinse the collard leaves and pat them dry. Cut stalks off at the base of the leaves. With a paring knife, cut the leaves off along each side of the center stalk. Stack the leaves together, roll up tightly and cut in 1/4"" slices. Then cut crosswise in 1/4"" slices. Transfer to a bowl and set aside. Heat a large heavy-bottomed skillet to medium-high heat. Add the olive oil, cayenne and garlic. SautÃ© for 30 seconds until the garlic releases its flavor but doesn't take on any color. Add the greens and toss until well coated with the oil. SautÃ© for 2 to 3 minutes until wilted, tossing frequently. Sprinkle with the salt, toss again and continue to sautÃ© for another 2 to 3 minutes, until the greens turn a darker shade. Transfer to a bowl and set aside.Step 3: In a small bowl, mix flour, baking powder, salt and pepper. Set aside. Place the eggs in a separate bowl and whisk until well blended. Add the buttermilk and whisk again until well blended. Add the dry ingredients and, using a wooden spoon, mix until well incorporated. Stir in the corn kernels and the collard greens and set aside. Heat a large heavy-bottomed non-stick frying pan over medium-high heat. Add 1 tablespoon of butter. As soon as the butter is melted, spoon 2 tablespoons of batter (for each pancake) into the pan. Reduce heat to medium/medium-high and cook the pancakes for 2 to 3 minutes, until the bottoms are golden. Flip the pancakes and cook for an additional 1 to 2 minutes until the bottoms are golden. Add the balance of the butter to the pan and repeat with the balance of the batter as above. Place the pancakes on a large serving platter. Garnish each pancake with a dollop of sour cream and serve warm.Viviane's TipCan't find sumac? No worries... Substitute the sumac for 1/2 teaspoon of finely grated lemon zest and stir it in the sour cream. It adds a delicate lemony note to the savory cakes."
