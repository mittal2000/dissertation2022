Marc was the Mark Zuckerberg of his day, a college kid on fire, who broke all the rules and then some. Marc built on the work of others with so much force and vision that the web browser became his creation and fame and fortune soon followed. Marc's Mosaic brought the World Wide Web into my home on a dial-up modem connection in 1993. After that my minutes on AOL began to decline as Mosaic became Netscape Navigator and over the years its source code directly inspired Microsoft's Internet Explorer and Mozilla's FireFox. In the original Mosaic we have almost all the basic features of the modern web browsing experience: URLs and hyperlinks, forward and backward navigation and a browsing history, bookmarks, sound and video, online forms, and cross-platform compatibility. All that Apple and Google have added to the web browser with Safari and Chrome have been footnotes to the original ideas present in Mosaic in 1993. Javascript, Ajax, CSS, HTML5, plug-in components, and online advertising are all wonderful features but they are optimizations.I, for one, would like to see something new and better than 20-year-old hacked together ideas with which to browse the massive, unstructured, and nearly endless ocean of content that is our contemporary World Wide Web. The web browser and its core feature set have become a straight jacket on innovation and is holding us back. I was inspired by Ted Nelson's Literary Machines in 1982, but it feels to me like we haven't gotten past chapter two.What's wrong with our beloved web browsers, used by billions of people every hour of every day?Web browsing is still pretty hard to do. URLs and domain names are awkward and unfriendly to ordinary humans: Whitehouse.gov is where you go to see what the president is up to. Whitehouse.com is where you go for single ""Czech ladies."" While it might make great political poetry there is simply no way to know where a "".com"" or a "".net"" is going to lead you.Creating a website or a web application has never been more difficult, in spite of all the tools and WYSIWYG editors available today. Sure, you can get a blog post up in minutes but you're stuck with the layouts, fonts, and styles that your webmaster has prepackaged into a template. And if you learn some HTML and CSS and stray from the template your site or app isn't going to work on mobile phones and pads without more effort than you can imagine. The HuffPost Tech team, like every other technology team in the world, spends 50 percent of its time writing the code and 50 percent making sure it works across all the devices and browsers that show web pages.Web links and bookmarks have random, invisible expiration dates. I don't bookmark pages anymore, I screen capture them. The link has become as unreliable has my first car: a used 1978 Chevy Camaro. I loved that car but I had no idea if it would start up in the morning. Here's a fun exercise: Go through your old bookmarks and count up how many result in unhelpful re-directs, Google Oops, or 404 pages (be sure to visit HuffPost's 404 page, it's a cult classic). I bet most of your old bookmarks are useless.Last year I was hopeful that a new web was dawning, the app web. Instead of a general purpose web browser I would have easy to use apps providing me with all the best services and info the web contains. After living in the app web for while I discovered it has its own class of problems. I have Spotify for music, Facebook for social, and Newegg for computer parts and there are still tons of web content that I'm missing. I simply don't have enough room on my phone for all the apps needed to replace the web browser and its open access to everything.Still, I want a new and better web browser. One where URLs are replaced by human friendly sentences, where website and web apps can be created by anyone, and one where links last forever.In 1993 I was speaking with one of Apple's chief technologists. I was very excited by Mosaic but he put me in my place. ""The web browser,"" he said,"" is a lousy user experience and will never replace applications for storing and managing data."" Unfortunately I took his advice seriously and didn't get back to the web until 1998, a bit late for the dot com boom but in plenty of time for the dot com bust.I don't need a new web, I need a new web browser. A web browser as radical as Mosaic was in 1993. A web browser that establishes new interactions and new metaphors. There's a long list of attempts a build a new web browser: Axis, RockMelt, Pogo, and Flock to name just a few. But they all have back buttons. The web browser for the next 20 years won't need old ideas like back buttons!"

(AP Photo/Mikhail Metzel)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce1191f00002d00216678.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Oz the Great and Powerful is Disney's new imagining of the class L. Frank Baum tale Wizard of Oz, providing a backstory to the iconic tale. The movie follows the beginnings of Oscar Diggs (James Franco), a down-on-his-luck illusionist who relies on his charm as well as some shady practices to get ahead. When a powerful twister roles through town, Oscar is transported to the land of Oz, where he is assumed to be a long-anticipated wizard. Oscar encounters three witches: Theodora (Mila Kunis), Evanora (Rachel Weisz) and Glinda (Michelle Williams), and Oscar suddenly finds that the fate of Oz is in is hands. Oz the Great and Powerful is an imaginative tale of good and evil and of human failings that create unimaginable consequences. Beyond the engaging story, though, the film is a lush and fantastical journey into another world, artistically told through cutting-edge CGI. It's hard to imagine anyone not being blown away by the impressive scenery of this film, and the 3-D effects are truly stunning. The characters draw us in to the story, but the cinematography is breathtaking as well. I saw the movie with my 8-year-old son and both of us gave it two thumbs up. I'm typically not a fan of the fantasy genre but really enjoyed this movie. This movie has a broad appeal, and I suspect it will be a popular movie for families to see together. There is action and adventure that will appeal to young boys, and girls who love princesses will likely be enchanted by the beautiful witches. But before you buy your ticket, you may need to contemplate your child's maturity level and whether or not they are old enough for some of the film's scarier themes. I'm going to try to do my best to break down the areas of concerns that parents might have without giving away any major spoilers. Supernatural/Scary Themes  Most of the movie hinges around supernatural elements, from dolls that talk to black magic. Some of the witches are evil and cast spells on others. The most frightening scenes involve the ubiquitous flying monkeys who are minions of an evil witch. In this movie, they are particularly gruesome, with faces that look like lions and sharp, scary teeth. There are several moments of scary surprise involving these monkeys, as well as a scene with a man-eating plant and small fairies with sharp teeth. The 3-D intensifies these scenes. One of the witches morphs into a rather hideous physicality that would no doubt terrify small children. My 8-year-old saw the movie with me and shielded his eyes during that scene. Violence  Some of the characters are intent on killing other humans. There is mass destruction and death. A main character is orphaned. There are scenes where weapons are used, where animals attempt to kill humans and where magic is invoked to physically harm others. Action  There is intense action in this movie, with several main characters in peril and risking death. While this may keep kids engaged in the movie, it could prove stressful for small children. Language  I did not note any bad words, cursing or questionable phrases in the movie. Sexuality  The main character is a womanizer, though the scenes revolving around this are tame. There is some kissing in the movie. Oscar's attitude towards women has grave consequences and could provide for some interesting talking points with children. Moral themes  I think most parents will appreciate the moral themes in the movie. While it isn't a movie about perfect people making perfect choices, the movie does highlight many moral dilemmas and the consequences that arise from both good and bad choices, including dishonesty, selfishness and revenge. Oz struggles with issues of pride and greed, and must overcome these tendencies to resolve conflict. Some characters illustrate the negative impact of unchecked resentment, hurt and anger, while others illustrate the positive impact of forgiveness and loyalty. I believe this movie could spark some incredible conversations between children and parents about morality, ethics and human behavior. In my opinion, this movie is appropriate for older children due to the frightening elements in the movie. I would enthusiastically recommend this movie to families with children ages 13 and up. I would exercise caution for children ages 6-12, depending on maturity level. I would not recommend this movie to children 5 and under. Oz the Great and Powerful opens in theaters March 8th."
7,DIVORCE,7 Things You Should Consider Before Getting Back Together With Your Ex,"CafeMom, Contributor
CafeMom is the meting place for moms",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/7-things-you-should-consi_us_5b9cde10e4b03a1dcc829114,"If your significant other wants to get back together, you might want to read this before you say yes.",2013-03-08,Husband trying to give wife flowers and getting the cold shoulder.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cde103c00005b0009ee5d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Written by Kiri Blakeley on CafeMom's blog, The Stir.The hardest thing about being in a relationship is probably trying to decide if you should end it. The second hardest? Whether you should give it another chance -- especially if you've already separated. There comes a time in most everyone's relationship when you think about throwing in the towel. And what if you do, but then your significant other wants you back? What if he promises to change? What if he swears up and down, back and forth, that that thing that tore you apart will never, ever happen again? Do you believe him? Do you risk getting your heart broken all over again?If you're thinking about breathing new life into a dead relationship, here are seven things you should consider first.What happened to break you up? People break up for all kinds of reasons -- everything from an affair to physical or emotional abuse to just not feeling like you have anything in common anymore. There are no right and wrong reasons to breaking up. Everyone has to weigh what works and doesn't work for them individually. What you might not be able to stomach anymore, someone else might not see as a big deal. Think hard about what it is that broke you up and whether or not it's something you can either forgive or live with -- because there's no 100 percent guarantee that it won't keep happening.Why do you want to reunite? Is it mostly because he's putting so much pressure on you? Or maybe your kids are, or your family is? This needs to be your decision, not anyone else's. Do you truly still love him and see a future together -- or are you just worried about a single income, about being lonely, or about dating again? Consider whether you'd get back together if everything else in your life was going fabulously. If not, then you probably don't really want him, but just a relationship. Even if it's not a good one.Look at the relationship as a whole. Sometimes when a relationship is bad, we end up breaking up over some silly thing -- but that was really just the straw that broke the camel's back. If you're feeling remorseful because you ended it over a forgotten anniversary or an ex he contacted on Facebook, ask yourself if this is truly why you broke up. Chances are, it was much deeper than that. Are you both admitting and confronting what really went wrong as opposed to the ""official"" reasons for the split?Is the problem a chronic one? Is what what broke you up something that keeps happening? How many chances have you already given your ex? Part of the conundrum of breaking up is that the ex can suddenly start to make all kinds of promises that whatever problems you have will never ever happen again. But if they've already happened over and over, the reality is that no matter how much your spouse wants to change, he may simply not be able to. Psychological forces often dating back to childhood have shaped this person's habits. Those won't easily be undone just because he wants them undone.Can you truly forgive? If you decide to get back together, you can't be throwing your ex's transgressions in his face every time you want to win an argument. Not that the problem can never be spoken of again, but it can't be your go-to ""gotcha.""Be friends first. Try being just friends with your ex first. This way, you can stay close enough to see if his behavior really has changed -- without the bonding chemicals of sex ratcheting up your attachment and expectations. If he's unwilling to give it a try again without sex being involved, then he most likely just wants to suck you back into the relationship and has no real intention of changing.Watch actions, don't listen to words. No matter how much your ex promises he'll never touch another drop of booze, or another woman, or will definitely get a job this time, don't listen to anything. Watch to see how he behaves. Remember it's his actions in the relationship that will determine everything. And watch for changes before agreeing to another chance.Remember that if you're even remotely considering reuniting with an ex who has serious issues like addictions of any kind, or who inflicted physical or emotional abuse on you or your children -- you must have outside help via therapy, support groups, etc. Physical abuse, especially, can escalate to the point where you are taking your own life into your hands if you keep going back. And abusers tend to be very good at making empty promises.Have you ever given an ex a second chance?

Now that you have spent enough time licking your wounds, you're contemplating the possibility of getting back in the game. This is completely normal, but it's been forever since you asked someone out on a date or were asked out on a date. To no surprise, the rules have changed since Bon Jovi had long hair. Men aren't quite into the art of romance. And, women aren't necessarily looking to take a man home to mom. The casual sex revolution has changed the dating game which leaves you stranded with no idea where to start. You're too old for the clubs and too young to be alone. Relax! There is a process to getting back in the game and finding the ""right one."" Here are five quick tips to get you ready to love again:1. Get Over It. Forgive yourself. Your ex was an ass. She took all your money. He sucked the life out of you. So, what? You're still breathing aren't you? That's a start. Move on already! You can't change the past but you can create an amazing future.ACTION: Be honest about what went wrong in your past. Accept responsibility and don't repeat your mistakes. Assess yourself. Admit you are not perfect and need some work. Seek counseling. Ask a friend to tell you the truth about your personal strengths and weaknesses. Make a list of changes and just do it!2. Reinvent Yourself. You may still think you've ""got it"" but let's be real -- after years of marriage and divorce you're not what you used to be. Posting your high school picture on dating sites won't give you back the years. Reinvent yourself! Your wardrobe is stuck in the 90s or worse. You're wearing your favorite outfit that fit just right 20 pounds ago. Look at yourself in the mirror and ask, ""Would you date yourself? And, why?""ACTION: Updating your style can help you start the physical transformation that gets you noticed. Guys: Get a personal shopper in a department store to help you update your style. Buy new jeans, a new jacket and new casual dress shoes. Your new style and confidence will get a woman's attention. Ladies: Your best work outfits will not help you compete in the dating market. There are three women to every man in the United States over age 18. It is a competitive market. Wear clothes that help you stand out from the crowd. That doesn't mean showing all your goods. It means what you wear makes an impression. Men are attracted to color so add a pop of color and accessories to all of your outfits.3. Get Out. A potential date isn't going to come knocking on your door and join you on the couch. Since your divorce, you no longer fit comfortably in your former social circle, so don't push it. Sometimes letting go is a good thing. But, where do you go to find other like-minded people? The answer is simple. Get out of your comfort zone!ACTION: Change your daily routine. If you are a parent, get involved in your children's activities. That's where other single parents go. Walk, join the gym or take dance classes. Find your old high school and college friends on social media or sign up for an online dating service.4. Develop a winning approach. Women hate pick up lines. Men fear rejection. That's the ultimate reason why there are 103 million single people in the U.S. and most aren't talking to each other. Your old pick up lines will be laughed at. Buying a girl a drink isn't enough anymore; she buys her own drinks. Playing coy doesn't get a man's attention -- it pisses him off. Being sexually aggressive doesn't work either; keep it simple and smile.ACTION:  Don't play games. Find 20 seconds of courage and change your life. Be you and use the following introduction, ""Hi, my name is ____, what's your name? ""5. Stop talking about work. Most of us are career-minded and have amazing accomplishments under our belts. You have to leave your professional life and job related conversations at work.ACTION: Ladies: Don't give a man your resume. He wants to know if you are interesting, fun, warm, caring, and loving. Guys: The right woman wants to know if you'll be good to her, respect her, support her and emotionally take care of her. Make sure you say and do things that communicate all the above points.Divorces crush your confidence and leave you wondering if there's something wrong with you. There is nothing wrong with you. There are millions of people in your shoes. What will set you apart is if you make a conscious decision to move forward. After all, you miss having someone to come home to, talk to, have hot, good sex with and most importantly, share magical moments. Don't wait! Do something about it, and do it now!"

The findings suggest that it's possible to deduce potential drug side effects based on symptoms people search for online, long before the side effects are officially known and confirmed. The study, conducted by researchers from Stanford and Columbia universities, focused on paroxetine, an antidepressant, and pravastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug, which were found to raise blood sugar as a side effect in 2011. The researchers wanted to see if Internet searches for high blood sugar as a side effect of these drugs were being made before the side effect was officially recognized in 2011, by examining Internet searches in 2010. The study included the analysis of search results from 6 million people, who gave consent to have a browser add-on installed onto their computers. The add-on tracked search results during 2010 on the major search engines Google, Yahoo! and Bing.Researchers found that one in 250 people searched for a common drug during the study period. Plus, those who searched for both paroxetine and pravastatin had nearly a doubled chance of also looking up high blood in association with the drugs. ""The prolific use of web search to pursue information can be likened to a large-scale distributed network of sensors for identifying the potential side effects of drugs,"" the researchers wrote in the study. ""There is a potential public health benefit in listening to such signals, and integrating them with other sources of information.""

The findings suggest that it's possible to deduce potential drug side effects based on symptoms people search for online, long before the side effects are officially known and confirmed. The study, conducted by researchers from Stanford and Columbia universities, focused on paroxetine, an antidepressant, and pravastatin, a cholesterol-lowering drug, which were found to raise blood sugar as a side effect in 2011. The researchers wanted to see if Internet searches for high blood sugar as a side effect of these drugs were being made before the side effect was officially recognized in 2011, by examining Internet searches in 2010. The study included the analysis of search results from 6 million people, who gave consent to have a browser add-on installed onto their computers. The add-on tracked search results during 2010 on the major search engines Google, Yahoo! and Bing.Researchers found that one in 250 people searched for a common drug during the study period. Plus, those who searched for both paroxetine and pravastatin had nearly a doubled chance of also looking up high blood in association with the drugs. ""The prolific use of web search to pursue information can be likened to a large-scale distributed network of sensors for identifying the potential side effects of drugs,"" the researchers wrote in the study. ""There is a potential public health benefit in listening to such signals, and integrating them with other sources of information.""

11,WELLNESS,What the Heck Happened to Let's Move? An Open Letter to Michelle Obama,"Nancy Fink Huehnergarth, Contributor
Political junkie/food and nutrition advocate",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lets-move-campaign_us_5b9ce528e4b03a1dcc82c52b,"If you continue to avoid supporting policy change, I believe that history will remember Let's Move as another ""feel good"" first lady program that's long on public relations and short on substance.",2013-03-08,"First lady Michelle Obama greets educators and state and community officials at a ""Let's Move!"" program at the Eastside and Northside Elementary Schools in Clinton, Miss., Wednesday, Feb. 27, 2013. Obama and television chef/personality Rachel Ray visited with the children and conducted a cooking contest between the schools' chefs. (AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce528250000350036402e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Dear Mrs. Obama,As you celebrate the third anniversary of your signature childhood obesity program, Let's Move, I have to ask this question: What the heck happened?You started out so boldly, with a focus on nutrition policy. That focus and your support led to the passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act in 2010, which is improving the food and drink children are served at schools across the nation. That accomplishment, Mrs. Obama, is real, sustainable change that will positively impact the health of millions of children for years to come. Thank you!But since then, you have backed away from supporting policy as if it were the plague. Currently, Let's Move's focus is on increasing physical activity and brokering voluntary agreements with the food and restaurant industries. Nothing is wrong with either of these initiatives, except that if you want to tackle childhood obesity, neither will make much of a dent. Physical activity is definitely important for the overall health, fitness and well-being of our children. But when it comes to the cause of obesity, studies have shown that a lack of physical activity is not the culprit. Public health advocates believe that a significant increase in calories is the real cause of our epidemic, and certainly the one you should be focusing on if you hope to reverse childhood obesity.Speaking of calories, you brokered a voluntary agreement with the Darden Restaurant chain in which they promised to reduce calories, across the board, at all of their restaurants, over a 10-year time span. Wonderful. I hope they keep their promise. And you've gotten Walmart to voluntarily agree to bring healthier fare, including produce, into its stores to help save consumers money (a promise which, this week, has been suggested to be less than successful -- with Obama Foodorama's Eddie Gehman Kohan suggesting  Walmart likely only ""saved"" each customer a breathtaking $8.57 in 2012). But once you leave the White House, Mrs. Obama, will any of your voluntary agreements be sustainable? Who will hold Darden's feet to the fire when the president's term ends? Who will ensure that Walmart is truly promoting healthier foods, like they claim to be, but others have been unable to verify? Voluntary agreements have merit, but let's be realistic. They will be extremely difficult to sustain once you've left the White House, and they should never be a substitute for policy or regulation. I'm sure you are also aware that voluntary agreements are a favorite tactic used by the food industry to put off policy and regulation that would create permanent, healthy change.Public health experts agree that policy and regulation are the real key to improving our nation's food system and ending the scourge of childhood obesity and related chronic disease like Type 2 diabetes. What kind of policies would make a difference? How about giving farm subsidies to farmers growing produce, rather than reward those who grow crops that are used to make junk food? How about limiting the marketing of unhealthy food to our children, increasing the price of cheap, non-nutritious sugary drinks, or providing front-of-package nutrition labels that are easy for consumers to understand? And how about policies that would reward the food industry for producing healthier fare, perhaps through tax credits.These are the types of creative, sustainable steps that will lead to a food environment more hospitable to health. But we've seen no recent sign that you will stand up and support strong nutrition policy or regulation. Rather, we're hearing that the White House (and I assume that you've been consulted) is actually holding up the final rule making and implementation of the federal menu labeling law, in order to significantly weaken it, thanks to industry's relentless lobbying. What policy could be more benign and helpful than one that gives consumers at chain food service establishments calorie information at point of purchase so they can make healthier decisions for themselves and their families?While it didn't surprise me that you chose to focus on physical activity and voluntary initiatives as we approached the president's 2012 re-election campaign, it does surprise me that you're still steering clear of support for policy change now that your husband has been re-elected. Don't you want to leave a legacy of sustainable policies that will continue to improve our children's health (and increase their lifespans) long after you have left the White House?Mrs. Obama, it's clear you care deeply about America's children and the epidemic of overweight and obesity that plagues this nation. Your leadership on the childhood obesity issue has raised awareness to new heights. But if you continue to avoid supporting policy change, I believe that history will remember Let's Move as another ""feel good"" first lady program that's long on public relations and short on substance. Please use the power you have now to leave a sustainable legacy in the form of policy and regulation that will ensure we have a healthier food supply and food environment in the decades to come.Sincerely,Nancy HuehnergarthFor more by Nancy Huehnergarth, click here.For more health news, click here.

Not because I don't love little girls, I do, although the Princess thing scares me, but because what frightened me more was passing down my body obsession and eating disordered history to daughters who might have sprung from my loins. Wait, men have the loins; I have a womb -- that, in fact, my children lived in for nine-plus months during which I spent not an insignificant amount of time wondering A) if I was gaining too much weight, B) if I would ever have arms again that weren't the circumference of small dogs and C) if eating two boxes of Pepperidge Farm anything was too much after a half-pound hamburger.I'm no Freud, but I was pretty sure that exposing a fetus to these thoughts did not bode well for the future of a little girl. With boys, I thought I'd be safe. Boys eat and run and eat some more. Boys don't ask if they look fat in their jeans, right? But long before Dr. Cara straightened me out on the misconception that boys don't have body image issues, I was faced with a different truth in our house. The aforementioned ""White Food Disorder.""Although it has nothing to do with their body image yet, my sons' fear of eating any food that isn't white is disturbing and was an initial wake-up call that food and body image issues are not gender-specific. I won't go in to further detail here about the White Food Disorder, (but feel free to pre-order the book by clicking on the link) suffice it to say, the only green items the boys ate until last year were holiday M&M's. But we've made headway now with Spanikopita and blueberries. Parenting is nothing if not a series of small victories.Regarding this episode on body image, I am surprisingly a woman of few words this week. It's unexpected because with a former model for a mother, I eat body image issues for breakfast. And I have been for almost 25 years. My mother was on a diet my entire life, and she tortured me and my older sister about our bodies. Somewhere around 1976, my mother put my sister on a liquid protein diet until her hair fell out. According to my mother at the time, she looked ""terrific."" Fat phobia ruled our household.It didn't help that when I left my parents' home, I became an actress. Everything you've heard about the lifestyle of actresses is true. During my first few years in LA, when I ate (which was rare), I inhaled steamed vegetables, popcorn or frozen yogurt (the 8-calorie-per-ounce kind). I weighed myself multiple times a day. No matter how small the number on the scale was, or the pant size, or the belt holes, I knew if I were only more disciplined, it could be smaller. A friend couldn't help but notice I had a problem and suggested I get help. Which I did.I wish I could tell you I have completely outgrown this preoccupation, but why lie? I still have concerns about my body size some days, but I think they fall more in the range of normal now. Although I still can't be alone with popcorn. Fortunately, my size no longer determines my employment. As I age, I find I am much more concerned, and grateful for, the strength and health of my body. Because the humble truth about my thicker-than-I'd-like torso is that it housed my children, and despite the fall out from that, my body also brings me a lot of joy. Not the same high as being a size 2 after being told ""You have such a pretty face,"" for much of my adolescence, but it's a very cool body nevertheless.Which must be why my big ""tip,"" at the end of my reserved contribution to this show, is ""There is hope!"" While my highly-educated and thoughtful co-hosts give you very important facts and statistics and suggestions, I think my mind was engaged in it's own flashback to my early life imprisoned by a terrible, sometimes paralyzing negative body image and how that is not the case today. Today, I can work on a set with the very lithe Dr. Cara and still come out of my dressing room. I don't think I could have done that in my 20s. I would have expended so much energy comparing my body to hers and ""feeling fat"" that I would have been too distracted to work. But, alas, there I am in my chair, talking and nodding my head. It's not that I don't notice that Cara has zero percent body fat, it's just that it doesn't matter. She's her and I'm me and it's all good.This seems to be the key to raising a child with a healthy body image. To help them eat well, get exercise (an hour EVERY DAY, according to Dr. Cara!) and once that is in the works, teaching them acceptance. Dark, fair, tall, short neck, long arms, small hands, big feet, whatever it is, this is the body you have been given. If you take care of it, it will allow you to dance and laugh and have sex (when you're older and not in my house, dear).Some days it will be bigger and some days it will be smaller, but enjoy it because in the truest definition of the word, your body is awesome.Subscribe to The Chopra Well and don't miss next week's episode of ""Perfectly Imperfect Parents""!Related Articles:Should Parents Allow Their Kids on Social Media?

13,PARENTING,6 Signs Your Kid Is Taking Competition Too Far,"LearnVest, Contributor
LearnVest is a program for your money.",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/competition_us_5b9ce6fde4b03a1dcc82d451,Your job is to help your child succeed -- but not at the expense of mental health. Here's how to know if your kid is becoming too competitive:,2013-03-08,Female college student stressed about her homework,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9ce6fd3c0000660009f174.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Did you ever win a race or a spelling bee? Do you remember how you felt?Research has shown that these ""winning"" moments may have a lasting effect: In a study of over 1,200 successful women, psychologist Sylvia Rimm of the Case Western Reserve School of Medicine found that they most frequently recalled winning in competition as a positive childhood experience.Under certain conditions, succeeding in a competitive environment is linked to general success and happiness. Oscar winners, for instance, live an average of four years longer than nominees. Kids who were popular in high school (thus succeeding in a competitive social environment) earn an average of percent more than unpopular kids.Yet, for some children, competition can actually reduce the motivation to succeed. As research from the Davidson Institute for Talent Development points out, competition ""is good for some, but it may result in a few winners and many losers."" Some students, especially those who are less motivated or who have a history of underachieving, ""often have difficulty dealing with defeat.""In other words, while competition can encourage certain kinds of kids, it can discourage others. And that doesn't even account for the burnout and stress that often accompany the fight to be number one.In this Tiger Mom age of highly competitive school admissions -- and not just for college, either -- parents are pushing their kids to new heights. This begs a few questions: Are you really doing your child a favor by going to great lengths to make sure he ends up in the top slot? If she's supremely stressed out over track tournaments and AP tests... is that kind of self-motivation good or bad?RELATED: How Does Your Spending Stack Up? [Infographic]As the mantra goes, all things in moderation. Your job is to help your child succeed -- but not at the expense of mental health. Here's how to know if your kid is becoming too competitive:1. She's Becoming a Braggart Your kid needs to remember that she has many positive qualities aside from her in-the-moment winnings. Plus, on a more tangible level, you don't want her to become ostracized by peers who resent the bragging.What to do about it: Try to reinforce the attributes she should be proud of that go beyond the specific record that she broke or test she aced. When you give her a compliment, focus not on the ""win,"" per se, but on the admirable qualities that helped her get there, such as hard work, motivation and the fact that she didn't give up even though she used to find this task difficult.2. He Gets Negative About Himself Noam Schpancer, a professor of psychology at Otterbein University who studies child care and development, says that it's possible to feel like a champion even when you're statistically average. ""Recent research in positive psychology shows that the sense of control and social connectedness afforded by high achievement can also be obtained by other means,"" he says. Even if your child doesn't consistently come in first, avoid letting him feel like he's at the whim of something beyond his power.What to do about it: If your child gets frustrated by losing, praise his effort and highlight the good things that he does. He might have struck out at bat, but you can point out how well he fielded the ball. If he's getting demoralized at a certain competitive activity, you can also consider switching his focus from competition to skill-building and teamwork by choosing activities like drama, art or music.3. She Acts Out With younger children, this may mean talking back, throwing a temper tantrum or shutting down. For older children, it could manifest as getting inordinately upset or making up excuses for losing. Not only is acting out unhealthy, it also risks alienating others, and it teaches the wrong lesson.What to do about it:Your child needs to learn how to lose. Talk about what it means to be a gracious loser and, although it may pain you, practice what you preach. Case in point: Maybe you go all-out when you play checkers or you give her increasingly difficult math problems until she's stumped. When she starts to act out, don't give in. Work with her until she learns to control herself. Remember that it's better that you're the one dealing with this side of your child than someone else.4. He Cheats in Order to Win This can range from literal cheating to changing or breaking the rules. Even if it's only a board game or an assignment for an extracurricular activity, treat cheating as a serious offense. If this turns into a habit, it can easily snowball into larger issues.RELATED: The Secret to Breaking Your Bad Money Habits (Really!)What to do about it: In the short term, cheating calls for a strong talking-to and a punishment. In the long term, think about the messages that you're sending. ""There are important questions other than 'who won?' that are useful for a child- - and a parent -- to ask and answer,"" says Schpancer. If you show irritation when he misses a shot in basketball or you compare him to his friends, you may send the message that your approval is contingent on achievement. Make it clear that you're more proud of your child's efforts than the end result.5. She Doesn't Respect Her Competitors Maybe she delights in trash-talking. Or perhaps she needs to convince herself that she's better than other people by calling them stupid or cheaters. Teaching respect -- even for those who are more talented- - will help her flourish as a child and in her adult life.What to do about it:Correct her when you hear trash-talking, and point out other people's strengths in addition to her own. Ask her for examples of things she has in common with her competitors to establish that they're equally worthwhile people. Going forward, encourage her to compete primarily against her own performance, so she learns to take pride in her own progress, as well as practice self-motivation.6. He's Running Himself Ragged Success may be sweet, but being happy and balanced is even sweeter. Signs that your child is too busy or stressed out: He's always tired, he's lost interest in things that used to be fun, he's become moody or he's stopped connecting with friends.RELATED: 10 Signs Your Child Is Too BusyWhat to do about it:You don't have to make him drop out of his honors classes or quit the swim team... yet. Instead, figure out: Does he love his activities or is he trying to pad his resume for college admissions? Yes, it's a competitive world, but if you fear for your child's sanity, make him choose at least one activity to drop and then see if the situation improves. If nothing else, guard his weekends, making sure that he has at least one day with a few hours of downtime.LearnVest's free Money Center will help you create a budget.
