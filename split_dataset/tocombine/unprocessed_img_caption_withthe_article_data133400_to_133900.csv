It was a bonus that landing in Agadir only took a four-hour flight from London, but what I came to discover during my 12-day trip was far more than what I expected.My girlfriend, Grace, and I first arrived in Taghazout, a small fishing village in the south west of Morocco. It was originally inhabited by the Berber people, who used the village to store their fishing equipment, as they preferred to reside in the foothills surrounding the village. With the ever-growing presence of the Spanish in the 19tth century, the village expanded with factories, mosques, and housing for the Berber people. Fishing for seafood is their main form of income (followed by the production of Argan oil,) with a rich current of fish and shellfish swept to their shores by the mass of the Atlantic Ocean. But the ocean has provided another form of income for this tight-knit community of humble residents -- the Dirham brought by surfers.We were dropped off in the village's town center/bus and taxi stop/impromptu livestock butchering station after a 40-minute taxi ride from its nearest city, Agadir, to the south. The chaotic ambiance hit us like a fresh onshore wind to the face.""You need a place to stay!? Good price for you my friend! Follow me! Best place in town!"" shouted the local businessmen, desperately trying to out pitch their fellow competitor. Thankfully, we had already booked a place to stay and our host Chris, easy to spot due to his 6ft 4"" stature and broad frame, arrived to pluck us from the crowd of swarming salesmen. A short stroll through the village brought us to our residence, a modest apartment with panoramic views from the roof terrace of the mountains and bustling village, spilling into the vastness of the Atlantic, stretched as far as we could see.We settled in to our home for the next week and sipped on freshly made Berber tea, the local tipple infused with mint, mountain leaf, and copious amounts of sugar. The locals called it 'Moroccan whiskey' as their religious views don't permit alcohol consumption, but to us, it quickly became just as satisfying.Our next adventure was out into the village to shop for our dinner -- chicken and vegetable tajine. I find that hitting the produce stalls is always a great way to submerse yourself in the local culture. The smell of fresh fish pierced the salty ocean breeze that swept through the streets, blending with the spices and herbs that commanded our senses as we walked past open-air stalls and kitchens. With this caressing our nostrils, our stomachs began to rumble with excitement. A healthy amount of vegetables, snacks and a kilo of chicken set us back the modest sum of 30 Dirham each -- around Â£2, or $4 USD.The next morning we walked from our apartment with waxed-up boards under arms and the sun on our backs, headed to a local surf spot called 'Panoramas'. The sand spread south in an endless stream of glistening gold. A host of bays and nooks cut through the shoreline, each offering different micro breaks and unique surfing conditions. Panoramas is a beach break mainly serving up right-handers by the rock frame on the near side of the beach. We shared the beach with a host of sunbathing tourists, waving away camel rides and local trinkets being sold to them by the steadfast local salesmen.After surfing and indulging ourselves in the homespun scene of Taghazout, we took a bus ride to the slightly bigger town of 'Banana Beach'. It was market day and the air was filled with exotic fragrances, crowded with families going about their weekly shopping, tourists looking for bargain souvenirs to bring home, and the makeshift stalls of energised salesmen, pitching their goods to the bustling crowd in five different languages. Vibrant red, orange and green spice piles towered from their stalls, shimmering gems framed in gold and silver laid out on carpets at our feet. I felt surprisingly relaxed in the chaos, excited by the culture whirlwind around me. A few hours later, exhausted and laden with bags but happy, we headed back to Taghazout.The next day we hired a car and headed north, with the promise of bigger swell at 'Boilers'. A safari-like road trip took us through some of Morocco's outback terrain and cliff hanging string roads. Arriving at the ocean, the surf appeared like a desert mirage as we squinted through the dust cloud of our journey. We quickly suited up and headed down the rocky entrance into the water. Fresh but not cold, we paddled straight into the line-up and waited our turn. Rumour of the returned swell had spread, so a barrage of wave-depraved surfers started to show up. The wait was worth it, and I was happy to find beautifully rounded right-handers peeling away with a light offshore breeze. While sitting in the line-up, I felt like I'd disappeared into this land of sensory riches, timeless and without identity. In that moment I wasn't 'Adam Williams, the twenty-five year old Englishman,' but just another ocean lover seeking freedom, waiting for those few moments of weightlessness with nature as my playground. Floating, quietly rocking back and forth as the ocean took it's own rest between sets, I reflected on how the west-coast of Morocco had been the perfect host."

(Photo by Jon Kopaloff/FilmMagic)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dbad33c000066000a4376.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While Angelina Jolie's announcement that she had a preventive double mastectomy raised awareness of breast cancer, it did not lead to more people understanding how gene mutations actually affect breast cancer risk. ""Ms. Jolie's health story was prominently featured throughout the media and was a chance to mobilize health communicators and educators to teach about the nuanced issues around genetic testing, risk, and prophylactic surgery,"" study researcher Dina Borzekowski, a research professor in the Department of Behavior and Community Health at the University of Maryland, said in a statement. ""It feels like it was a missed opportunity to educate the public about a complex but rare health situation.""The study, published in the journal Genetics in Medicine, looked at the results of a survey that included 2,572 U.S. adults. Most of the people in the survey -- three out of four -- were aware of Angelina Jolie's breast removal surgery because she wanted to reduce her risk of developing breast cancer. But disappointingly, fewer than 10 percent of the respondents were able to answer specific questions about the BRCA gene mutation (which raises breast and ovarian cancer risk).In addition, the survey revealed that people incorrectly believe that if they don't have a family history of breast cancer, they have a lower-than-normal risk of breast cancer. In fact, researchers noted that the risk of developing breast cancer is between 5 and 15 percent for women without the BRCA mutation. ""While celebrities can bring heightened awareness to health issues, there is a need for these messages to be accompanied by more purposeful communication efforts to assist the public in understanding and using the complex diagnostic and treatment information that these stories convey,"" the researchers wrote in the study.

7,MONEY,Investment Lessons From Forrest Gump,"David A. Dedman, Contributor
President and Founder, Lexington Wealth Management",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/investment-lessons-from-f_us_5b9dbc33e4b03a1dcc8c3749,Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get. Investing is the same way.,2013-12-27,"'Have No Regrets' --Richard Branson, Founder of Virgin Group",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dbc28240000320053b4ff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Forrest Gump is one of my all-time favorite movies. Every time it is on TV, I just have to watch it. I find myself quoting lines from the movie all the time!The movie is full of fantastic life lessons. I also believe there are some great investment lessons to learn from simple gazillionaire Forrest Gump. So here's a few great quotes that provide timeless investment lessons:Life is like a box of chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get.  Investing is the same way. There's always another crisis around the corner. Let's face it, there are only certain things we can control. You cannot control the 2008 Credit Crisis, hurricanes, dot com bubbles, housing bubbles, Middle East turmoil or the price of oil. However, you can control how you react to these crises. You can also control whether it causes you to make changes to your portfolio. Work on controlling things like fees, your asset allocation and how much you choose to invest. Stop worrying about things that you have no authority over.Stupid is as stupid does. This means you are what you do. Forrest was called dumb most of his life, but that never stopped him from his incredible accomplishments. It's your actions that will determine where you end up. Your actions become habits, and good investment habits will determine whether or not your will reach your financial goals. So don't be dumb -- save, diversify, avoid emotion and pick a good advisor.""It"" happens. We all know what ""it"" is. What I think Forrest Gump means is that bad things happen sometimes. For whatever reason, an investment doesn't work out. Even as a financial advisor for twenty years, and I don't always pick a winner, ""It"" happens to me too! Cut your losses and move on. Decide on a maximum amount you can tolerate losing and invest appropriately. I've seen way too many investors that say they will stick with an investment until they get their money back. That's a fools game and it may never happen. There's always another investment.Lieutenant Dan was always getting these funny feelings about a rock or trail or the road, so he'd tell us to get down, shut up. Investors sometimes think that since they have this feeling that an investment will go up, or the stock market is set for a correction, that they should listen to that little voice. If you think back, did that little voice help you or trip you up? That little voice is driven by emotion and not logic. Emotion is the enemy in the investment world. Rely on logic as much as possible.The good part about being shot in the buttocks was the ice cream. They gave me all the ice cream I could eat. While I'm not sure being shot in the buttocks was good, there is a great investment lesson to be learned. The money lesson here is sometimes the best thing you can do is not think -- don't obsess over an investment. Have the faith that the investment or financial situation will work it's way out for the best. I always crack up when Forrest offers Lt. Dan ice cream and he sticks it in a bed pan!Lieutenant Dan got me investing in some kind of fruit company. So then I got a call from him, saying we don't have to worry about money no more. And I said, that's good! One less thing. I think we all wish we had a few shares of some kind of fruit company. No, the lesson is not about lucking out on the next great tech... uh I mean fruit company. The investment lesson here is trust your investments to wise advisor. I don't know if Lt. Dan managed the money or not. Seek an advisor that has experience, good credentials and puts their clients first. Picking a wise steward of your money will allow you to worry about one less thing.So now you know some investment lessons from Forrest Gump himself. Timeless investment lessons from this simple guy.
