Especially with new runs like the ""Tough Mudder,"" where trudging through mud, hopping over fire or crawling beneath barbed wire is a typical obstacle, all aspiring runners need to properly train areas of their body before hitting the course -- not only to show off those guns, but to safely maneuver through it.Before you take on your first mud run, make sure you incorporate these exercises into your fitness regimen. These moves will target areas of the body needed to hurdle, crouch, lunge and jump your way to victory and once mastered, you'll be fully prepared for the obstacles in the Warrior Dash, Tough Mudder, Spartan Race or a local version of these adventure races sweeping the nation. Side Plank Series While you're slipping down mountain-sized obstacles and balancing over ice baths, make sure your core is tight and you're keeping your balance. This side plank series is great for moments when you need to climb up those slippery slopes, over hay bale mountainous regions or lay low on the ground.a. Start in a low plank position: laying face-down and propping yourself up on your forearms.  b. Slowly drop your right hip down to the ground with your core engaged.  c. Switch to the left side and repeat until you feel the burn.50 Jump Lunges (or Leap Frogs) To increase your leap leg-span, practice these in every routine. They'll come in handy during mud pits, tire jumps and other obstacles that require quad-strength. a. Begin by lowering yourself into a low squatting position.  b. Place your feet slightly wider than hip-width apart, bend your knees and lower your bottom toward the ground.  c. Continue lowering until your knees are as close to a 90-degree angle as possible. Stay in this position as you jump forward.  d. As you leap, keep your head, neck, shoulders and arms relaxed. The quality of the jump is more important than the speed or quantity at this point.Spider Lunge (Walk or Crawl) Low ropes, hanging fire and other elements will constantly be bombarding runners during this course, and to combat the aerial obstacles, get and stay low! Training your lower body will help you immensely in this course -- and spider lunges will keep you out of harm's way.a. From a position in which you are on all fours but only inches off the ground, crawl along the ground keeping your body very low, arms and legs spread as wide as possible. Burpee With Jump During the course, fallen or staged obstacles will cross your path, and it'll be your job to jump over and under hurdles as you make it towards the finish line. Burpees with jumps will familiarize yourself with avoiding objects and help keep your speed on the course. a. Begin standing with your feet shoulder-width apart.  b. Lower your body down, bending at the hips and knees, so your hands are on the floor.  c. Thrust out your legs behind you, so that you're at the start of a pushup position.  d. Do a pushup, then pull your knees toward your chest so your feet are beneath you.  e. Jump up and land softly in a standing position.High Knees Although many underestimate this exercise, it will come in extremely handy when running through mud, water or any low-to-the-ground rope equipment during the course. Make sure to throw it into your circuit it also doubles as cardio to get heart rate up.a. Stand in place with your feet hip-width apart.  b. Drive your right knee toward your chest and quickly place it back on the ground.  c. Follow immediately by driving your left knee toward your chest.  d. Continue to alternate knees as quickly as you can.  e. Hold your arms out to the side at shoulder length as you high step.For more by Angeles Burke, click here.

No really, think Norman Bates scary.",2013-03-27,"A draft copy of the 21-page of a Health and Human Services Department form proposed for use to apply for low-cost insurance from Medicaid or the Children's Health Insurance Program is photographed in Washington, Tuesday March 12, 2013.

David Ake)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf33d26000035007fadf2.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ah, health insurance. If you have a job that pays for your health insurance and have never had to deal with the insurance companies directly maybe you get a warm, fuzzy feeling when thinking about the security of your health insurance. For those of us who have gone through cancer treatment or who are self employed and have had to navigate this ultra confusing world by ourselves it most likely strikes fear in your heart. I can hear the collective sighs of all of us who have been through the ringer when it comes to health insurance companies. Let me backtrack a little. I was sitting on my bed after coming home from my appointment with the first oncologist that I was recommended to. (I ended up getting second and third opinions and choosing the third doctor. I believe very strongly in getting at least a second opinion especially when you've been diagnosed with a serious disease.) The first oncologist had me convinced that radiation was a likely part of my treatment along with the requisite six months of chemotherapy for the Hodgkin's Lymphoma that I had just been diagnosed with. The other two oncologists said that they would avoid it at all costs, unless absolutely necessary. I'm not saying that the first oncologist was wrong, she obviously was giving me the right information but the other two oncologists presented it in a way that didn't make it seem as scary or as inevitable. They let me know it was certainly a possibility but it definitely wasn't absolute. I chose the third doctor that I met because I needed a smart, compassionate doctor that I could talk to and ask any questions of and I didn't settle until I found that doctor. It's so important that you're comfortable with your doctor and that you feel like you're being heard no matter how insignificant you may feel your questions are at times. When you're diagnosed with cancer it's like being dropped off on a foreign planet, alone. Everything is different and your doctor is your tour guide. Nothing is ever the same again and you depend on them to navigate this new world.So there I was, sitting on my bed, getting ready to make some phone calls. I made a lot of phone calls from my bedroom. My children were small at the time, my daughter was seven years old and my son was three. Although I didn't know how much they would understand I didn't want them to hear every little phone call about cancer, cancer, cancer, until I knew exactly what was going on. My husband and I needed some time to know exactly how much and exactly what we would tell them. So as my head was swimming I stared at the four prescriptions spread out on my bed just staring back at me, all for testing required before I was to start chemo. One for a heart scan, one for a lung function test, one for a PET/CT scan and one for a port. My first phone call was to our health insurance company for pre-approval (cue scary music). No really, think Norman Bates scary.The representative that I spoke to from the insurance company was very nice as she expressed that she was sorry to hear about my diagnosis. She began to tell me what testing was covered and then the hammer dropped. It went something like this: ""We cover most of the testing that you just mentioned but we don't cover chemotherapy."" Talk about being kicked when you're down. I had just been diagnosed, I didn't know what stage the cancer was at, I had a family at home that I wanted to live for and now what? Despair set in, that's what. I knew it wasn't her fault but all I could think was you mean to tell me that the insurance that my husband and I work hard to pay for doesn't cover chemo for my very treatable cancer? Rip-off insurance say what?My husband was still building his landscaping business at the time and we were getting by financially. We certainly wouldn't be able to pay for treatment out of pocket (I'm not sure there are many people who could). My main job is raising our children but I also work part time from home doing medical transcription (that's a fancy term for typing out doctor's reports). So we were doing the best we could not unlike most young families. We were both working and we had the health insurance we could afford which unbeknownst to us translated to ""super crappy insurance."" We knew it wasn't top of the line but we had no idea that it was this bad. Who thinks to ask what disease might or might not be covered when getting health insurance? You just assume that you pay a lot of money and the coverage is going to be there for you if and when you need it. Um... wrong!Thankfully I knew enough that you could find programs that would still treat you if you were having financial issues. I told my doctor what was going on and he and his team helped me get set up as a clinic patient for those of us who find ourselves ""underinsured"" or with other financial issues. As a result most treatment related expenses were covered.I know that health insurance is a huge hot button topic in our country and I don't have the answers. What I do know is this, health insurance is a right not a privilege. When you're literally fighting for your life you shouldn't have the added stress of worrying about whether or not you can afford to get the treatment that you need. People shouldn't have to die from treatable diseases because they can't afford to get treatment. I look forward to the day that health insurance companies actually care about our health more than their bottom line."

Tim Woda, co-founder of UknowKids.com, understands this and is trying to help parents in the Internet age.""Answer me this -- do you know who your child made friends with on Facebook yesterday?"" Woda poses this question whenever he discusses Internet safety with concerned parents. The common response is what you expect. Woda says most honest parents answer no, mostly because they are not that tuned in to the children's Internet lives. Woda should know. As a parent himself, he is dealing with these same struggles. Five years ago, Woda's 14-year-old son accepted a friend-request from a friend-of-a-friend on Facebook. This new ""friend"" turned out to be an Internet sexual predator. Back then, Woda thought that he had taken a proactive measure toward Internet safety. ""We tried to do all of these things that the experts told us to do around parental control software and putting the computer for the house in the kitchen and talking to our kids about smart decisions. The challenge is that kids don't do every single thing you want them to do."" Bad things happen to good parents and teenagers have minds of their own. Their desire for privacy very easily outweighs their interest in sharing with their parents.Studies show that two out of three parents are ignorant of their children's Internet activities. In part, this is because kids actively hide the things that they are doing. For example, more than 50 percent of all children routinely erase their Internet search histories.Following his son's abduction, Woda describes the hard reality he had to accept regarding his role as a parent. ""I had to ask myself, 'How did this happen?' Was it because I didn't love my child? Of course not. Was it because I didn't put rules in place, because I wasn't aware? No. ""It happened because the world around him changed faster than his approach to keep up with it, a common concern for today's parents. Despite the near ubiquity of social media in our daily lives, it is important to remember that a mere 15 years ago, there was no Facebook, Google or Tumblr.The reality is that while technology has advanced, quickly, this generation's parenting skills have not kept pace. It may not be our fault, but it is certainly our problem.""People tend to think about this as a technology problem: cyber bullying, sexting,"" Woda says. ""But the reality is, these are parenting problems."" I asked Woda to share a few tips with us about how to address incorporate technology into our everyday parenting. 1. Teach kids that technology is a tool, not just a toy. Start talking to your children early and often about ways to use technology in a constructive, productive way. If kids see technology as a tool as opposed to simply a device to entertain them, they tend to find more productive ways of using it. 2. Parents need to participate in their children's digital world. Parents need to play games with their children. I go into schools all the time and ask, ""How many of you have ridden bikes with your kids? How many of you have played dollhouse with your kids?"" Parents' hands go up. ""How many of you have played Minecraft online? How many of you have played Farmville with your children?"" Arms never go up. Moms and Dads need to appreciate that the toys of childhood have changed and if they want to engage it might include sitting around playing Minecraft together. It may not be Monopoly. 3. Parents need to set usage limitations on mobile phones. Phones are computers and we need to set the same limitations on phones as we do computers. Most parents don't set usage limitations until after there is a problem. That's part of why the problems happen to begin with; they don't appreciate that a mobile phone is a small computer. They keep the family computer in the living room and then they send their kid with their smart phone to their bedroom at night. They wonder why their kid isn't getting any sleep. 4. Parents need to teach their kids to not be duped by the use of the term ""buddy"" or ""friend."" Just because a website calls it a buddy or a friend does not mean it's not a complete stranger. A friend is someone you have laid eyeballs on, that you have met and have a relationship with. We tell our kids all the time, ""Don't talk to strangers."" Then we completely throw those rules out the window when we get online. Parents need to know this, to model the right behavior and to teach kids not to engage strangers on the Internet. We will share more of Woda's technology and parenting tips in the next couple weeks."

(AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cf9152200003000d972a0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"My 15-year old son just told me that he tried marijuana a few weeks ago with his buddies. I don't know if I should punish him or if doing so will only make him become dishonest. He said he didn't like it, but I'm not sure I believe him.  Within the world of parenting teens, the issue you've raised is one of the most difficult to address. Despite all the talks we have about the dangers of drugs with our children when they are young, most of us are resigned to the fact that our kids will probably experiment with at least alcohol and pot once they arrive at adolescence. Here's my advice:• Assess your child's risk. A youngster who is generally doing well in life -- happy, well adjusted, engaged with the family -- generally poses less risk for potential problems than one with a family history of drug or alcohol abuse, depression or in the midst of a family crisis. If your son falls in the high risk category, I would urge you to get outside professional help to nip any serious problems in the bud.• Be cautious about punishments. If there is no history of addiction in your family tree and you are certain that your son is generally doing well socially, emotionally and academically, focus on keeping the lines of communication open. If your teen is afraid of your reaction, it is unlikely that he will continue to confide in you. Punishing him may simply encourage him to become better at hiding any future use from you.• Strengthen connection. When we feel seen, understood and cherished by someone, it is much harder to keep secrets from them. Teens often give us signals that suggest they aren't interested in having us around, but look for ways to keep nourishing the connection you and your son share -- cooking together, walking the dog or even chatting about music or sports while you unload the dishwasher together. The more he feels anchored to you as his North Star, the less influenced he will be by peer pressure.• Talk with him about how he felt when he smoked. If he tells you that he really liked it, discuss why drugs and alcohol make people feel better. Explain the way the brain works, and the impact these substances can have on lowering inhibition or lifting mood --temporarily.• Model healthy ways of unwinding. Consider what your son sees you doing to relax at the end of the day, or when you socialize with your friends. If you have a glass of wine the minute you get home from work or immediately open a six-pack when friends show up, you may be ""teaching"" him that enjoyment cannot happen without some kind of substance. Show him you can enjoy life without leaning on something to help you lower your inhibitions or numb out, and you will send the message that he can do the same.• Don't force unwanted advice. Instead, ask him if he would be open to listening to your concerns. Explain that while you understand ""everyone"" may be smoking weed or drinking, the stress relief many kids experience while under the influence of pot or alcohol can quickly become at least psychologically addicting, and that there are better -- and healthier -- ways of handling social anxiety and pressures. Show him the impact these substances have on the brain; there are some great scans at brainplace.com.•Keep your eyes open. If you start to sense that your son's use has escalated beyond normal experimentation, do not hesitate to set guidelines that send him a clear message that it is not okay. At 15, his brain is still in a vulnerable and formative stage, and it is your responsibility to help him make sound decisions that preserve his health and safety. Some kids tell me that they actually appreciate it when their parents tell them that they might start conducting random drug tests; it makes it easier way to say ""No"" at a party if they can tell their buddies, ""I can't; my parents are drug testing me.""Most kids in today's society are going to be offered the opportunity to try alcohol and marijuana many times. But while it's likely that our youngsters will be offered the chance to try illegal substances, it is not in their best interests for parents to look the other way. Teens still need us to help them make good choices. Acting like it's no big deal can send a confusing message to a youngster who might not want to drink every weekend, but may not know how to handle the peer pressure to do so. Stay lovingly connected to your son, keep your eyes open and keep those lines of communication open."
