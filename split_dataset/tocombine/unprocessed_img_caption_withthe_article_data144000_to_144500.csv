Hundreds of people fanned out across a rugged, forested area of northern New Mexico in search of Adams who has been missing since Friday, Aug. 30, 2013, but there was still no sign of him Tuesday, Sept. 3, 2013, evening. Engine crew Capt. Token Adams vanished while checking on a report of smoke east of Jemez Springs, where he lives with his wife and young son. Adams, who was on an ATV, failed to return to a pre-arranged meeting point with two other firefighters. Searchers have been scouring canyons and mesa tops, through heavy timber, brush and grass. Rain hindered the search Monday, but only light rain was reported Tuesday afternoon as some 250 people aided the effort to find Adams.

He disappeared last Friday after he went out to check on a lightning-sparked in the Jemez Mountain District of the forest.""They believe at this time that the cause of death was an ATV (all-terrain vehicle) crash,"" Shell said.Adams had gone out to check on the blaze with two colleagues, but they separated with plans to meet later, Denise Ottaviano, spokeswoman for the Santa Fe National Forest, said earlier this week.The fire that Adams and the other two firefighters were sent to assess was contained at 25 acres (10 hectares).

""This defines what we consider priority conservation land. It is a combination of healthy forest, thriving wetlands and wildlife habitat, and it connects to other areas in the Sierra.""Sierra Pacific officials expressed equal satisfaction with the outcome. ""It's a real positive thing for the community overall,"" spokesman Mark Pawlicki said.Before the agreement is finalized, Placer County must approve and amend the Martis Valley Community Plan, a 2003 initiative that approved the construction of up to 1,360 homes in the contested area. Sierra Watch challenged the plan in 2005 with a court order suspending all approvals and activities under the community plan."

James joined Fox Sports Southwest in late August but was fired after just one appearance.A former college football standout at SMU and with the New England Patriots during the 1980s who went on to become a polarizing analyst for ESPN, James left broadcasting to enter the race for a vacant senate seat in Texas in 2011. During a debate in February 2012, James said that gay people would ""answer to the Lord for their actions"" and claimed that being gay was ""a choice,"" according to USA Today. He also chastised opponent Tom Leppert for attending a gay pride parade. “We just asked ourselves how Craig’s statements would play in our human resources department,” an unnamed Fox spokesman told Barry Horn of the Dallas Morning News after it was reported that James had been fired. “He couldn’t say those things here.”James made one appearance on FSSN during the first weekend of the college football season and then was sacked. Citing unnamed sources, Richard Deitsch of Sports Illustrated reported that James' hiring ""had not been fully vetted at the highest levels of Fox Sports management.""""Craig James will not be making any further appearances on Fox Sports Southwest's football coverage this season,"" a Fox Sports spokesperson told Deitsch.While at ESPN, James became embroiled in a controversy involving coach Mike Leach, then the coach at Texas Tech. In 2011, James left ESPN to run for office. When FOX Sports Southwest announced James' return to broadcasting, they touted the hire proudly. “We’re excited to add Craig to the FOX Sports Southwest team,” FSSW executive producer Mike Anastassiou said when James was hired, according to the Houston Chronicle. “He’s a talented broadcaster who I’ve admired throughout his career. His knowledge of college football and the experience he brings as an analyst will be a tremendous asset to our coverage.”"

The Wolverines defeated the Irish 35-31. (Photo by Leon Halip/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb709222100002501c8deb9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Dave Miller, National Football PostWhen Notre Dame and Michigan meet on Saturday night in Ann Arbor, it could be the last time the two programs meet at Michigan Stadium for a very long time.With the two historical universities unable to agree upon a schedule beyond 2014, the Fighting Irish will make their last visit to the Big House for quite a while. And the Wolverines won't be seeing Touchdown Jesus for a long time after next year's clash.Notre Dame's move to the ACC (the football program agreed to play at least five annual games with ACC opponents) forced the Irish to cancel three previously scheduled games with the Wolverines, so the 2015-17 games will not be played. It appears that the earliest the schools could resume the series is in 2020 because of a previously scheduled break negotiated for 2018 and 2019.The series between ND and Michigan spans 40 games, with the Wolverines holding a 23-16-1 advantage. When the teams met in 1978 for the first time in 35 years, the rivalry started to take off. The game has been played annually 27 times since.Both teams enter Saturday night's contest coming off of strong Week 1 wins and with high expectations for 2013. But the winner of the weekend's contest will have more than just bragging rights -- it will have history in its grasp, at least for one week.Pat Forde of Yahoo! Sports took note of the significance of the two programs on Thursday by revealing on Twitter that the honor of being the all-time winningest program in college football history (in terms of winning percentage) is at stake. Heading into this game, Notre Dame is first at .73325, according to cfbdatawarehouse.com. Michigan currently ranks No. 2 at .73312. If the Wolverines win, their percentage increases to .73333, with that Irish dropping to .73264.So after well over 100 years of football, Notre Dame and Michigan are separated by a miniscule .00013 in winning percentage.Notre Dame won 13-6 last season in South Bend, forcing six turnovers. But the Wolverines have won three straight at home in the series, and Devin Gardner wasn't running the offense in last year's loss. Could Brady Hoke's squad continue the home magic and claim the top all-time winning percentage?Here are some other memorable moments from this rivalry:- In 1989, No. 1 Notre Dame beat No. 2 Michigan 24-19 when Rocket Ismail returned two kickoffs for touchdowns in the second half. Legendary Wolverines head coach Bo Schembechler would then retire after the season.- Two years later, Michigan exacted its revenge with a 24-14 win, highlighted by a Wolverines touchdown on a fourth-and-one play while leading 17-14. Elvis Grbac hit eventual Heisman Trophy winner Desmond Howard in the back of the end zone for the score.- In the first night game at Michigan Stadium in 2011, the Wolverines won in dramatic fashion 35-31. The teams combined for three touchdowns in the final 1:12, with Denard Robinson hitting Roy Roundtree for a 16-yard score with two seconds left.Dave Miller, the college football editor and writer for the National Football Post, is on Twitter @Miller_Dave "
