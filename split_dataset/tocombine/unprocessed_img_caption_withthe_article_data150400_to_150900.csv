So why then, should you stick to your same signature makeup look?",2013-07-01,2013-07-01-jackjackiekennedysailingcapecodlife1HP.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2013-07-01-jackjackiekennedysailingcapecodlife1HP.jpg,"A summer sojourn is all about escaping from your daily routine; while on vacation you shape shift to suit your location and a more relaxed timetable -- if there's a timetable at all! You dress in a different way, dine at different times in different locations, you lighten up on the demands of your day. So why then, should you stick to your same signature makeup look? While sunscreen, a coat of mascara, and a lick of lip balm may be sufficient for sun-soaked days, amping up the glam factor for an evening out is all part of the (holiday) fun. Mastering the art of jet-set glamour is simple: consider your destination and the mood you want to evoke prior to takeoff in order to create maximum glamour with minimal makeup baggage. The Greek Islands: A Look that Lasts from Sunset to Sunrise Every time I visit Greece, I'm inspired by the beauty of the islands and the women who live and play there. A mere mention of the Mediterranean conjures up images of sun-drenched goddesses with a hint of European glamour and glitz. To create a look that lasts through dinner, dancing and beyond, it's essential to start with a primer that works overtime to keep your skin fresh and any base you're wearing in place. A hydrating, pre-makeup base like my Auto Pilot Pre-Foundation Skin Primer is ideal for hot, humid summers. Forgo foundation and choose a tinted moisturizer or a BB cream to even our your skin tone and add a hint of color. To fake a glow worthy of a sun goddess, choose a blush that combines coral and bronze hues and sweep it up toward the temples. Finish with waterproof mascara, some liquid eyeliner (pencils don't last well in the heat), and a slick of lip gloss and you're a goddess! Vacationing with my wife and Goddess Soula-Marie Palm Springs: Lo-fi Desert Chic  My home in Palm Springs is my year-round retreat and the beauty approach for 'desert rats,' as they're known, is definitely dialed down from the perfectly polished looks seen back in Hollywood. The earthy tones of the desert seem to inspire a subtle approach to makeup that's understated but undeniably chic. Skin appears naturally flawless, a look that can be achieved with a weightless base like my Off Duty Tinted Moisturizer. Work some shape into the face by contouring with a bronzing powder. Be sure to make room in your makeup bag for a multi-tasking palette of creamy metallic shades to add subtle contours and highlights that add texture with minimal color to keep this look on the light side. If you want to add volume to your lashes without the maintenance of mascara, apply a few individual faux lashes to define the lash line and you're ready for cocktail hour! Palm Springs chic models from an NP Set photo shootMartha's Vineyard: Pretty Preppy Best known as the summer retreat of the Kennedy family and countless politicos who followed, Martha's Vineyard plays host to an impeccably groomed set of vacationers each summer. To look the part of American royalty, clean, fresh skin is a must. Pack a multi-tasker with a fab finish like my new Auto Pilot BBB Cream SPF 30 for a base that will take you to from days by the beach to nights dining al fresco. For a healthy flush of color (essential for a day of sailing or sunbathing) make your favorite lipstick work overtime by smoothing a touch of color onto the apples of the cheeks and up toward the temples. To add a touch of pure glamour for evening, punctuate your pout with a perfect red lip.  a classic shot of JFK and Jacqueline Kennedy (credit: Life magazine)Capri: La Dolce Vita  Sitting pretty in the Gulf of Naples, the isle of Capri marries awe-inspiring views with the dolce vita luxury of Italian culture. If you've sighted the latest Dolce & Gabbana campaign, you'll get the look to channel: quintessentially Italian beauty including a bold matte lip, carefully sculpted brows and glamorous black liquid liner. Few of us are blessed with naturally flawless brows so an all-in-one kit like my NP Set Essential Brow Set is worth finding room for in your beauty bag. It packs tweezers, shaping wax and two shades of brow powder for brows that go the distance from day to night. Of course you can't beat a classic red lip for insta-glam and it's a great cheat move when you want to make a statement without going to too much effort. Just remember to stick with a matte formula that's less likely to move and won't require as much maintenance as a glossy finish demands. Line lips last to further contain the color but trust that in some sense, you'll be sure to make your mark! a shot from the Dolce & Gabbana fall 2013 ad campaign"

Chris Fraley, associate professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and co-author of the study. ""Such a person is more comfortable depending on the parent and is confident that the parent will be psychologically available when needed.”Fraley and graduate student Marie Heffernan completed two studies that analyzed the effects of divorce on children's relationships with their parents. They surveyed 7,735 people about their personalities and close relationships, and more than one-third of those surveyed came from homes of divorce. Fraley explained the importance of these findings in determining how people form close relationships after witnessing the end of their parents' marriage.""People's relationships with their parents and romantic partners play important roles in their lives,” Fraley said. ""This research brings us one step closer to understanding why it is that some people have relatively secure relationships with close others whereas others have more difficulty opening up to and depending on important people in their lives.”Click through the slideshow below for more fascinating divorce-related research findings.Keep in touch!

Rick Perry speaks to the National Right to Life convention at the Hyatt Regency DFW International Airport Hotel June 27, 2013 in Grapevine, Texas. Perry has reportedly vowed to continue the fight for a more restrictive abortion law in Texas after the state legislature failed to get the law passed during a special session because of a filibuster and protests. (Photo by Stewart F. House/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad23b32200003501da902c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Ladies of Texas, you ought to be ashamed of yourselves! From the time you were all tiny cowgirls toddling around in your very first pair of pink cowboy boots, you were raised to do two things: Always act like little ladies and keep an eye on the horizon. You were told that as long as you did those two things, Mr. Right would eventually come along, and you'd be able to spot him when he did. Governor Perry is your Mr. Right. But not only do you not know a good thing when it's standing right in front of you, you don't even know it when it's all the way up in your business. He's been trying his hardest to be your Prince Charming for 12 long years now, but you keep doing everything you can to run him off. (Everything this side of voting him out of office, that is.) I am still shocked at your embarrassing display of unladylike conduct at the Texas Capitol the other night. Governor Perry was trying his best to spare you from pesky decisions regarding your lady parts, and rather than thanking him for Senate Bill 5, you got all hysterical. I know it wasn't entirely your fault -- that rabble-rouser Wendy Davis bears much of the blame for getting you all whipped up. She's a bad influence, for sure. But still, you were raised better than that. And that was just the most recent example of ungrateful behavior on your part. The truth is, whenever Governor Perry tries to take care of everything for you, you act like he's crossing some sort of line. He's only doing what any self-respecting Mr. Right is supposed to do! He's trying to make all of your important decisions for you with his man brain so you don't have to worry your pretty little heads about any of that hard, ""thinky"" kind of stuff. Remember, thinking is the #1 cause of wrinkles. I mean, anyone educated in Texas public schools knows this just as sure as they know that God created the world 6000 years ago. That's just plain science. And if you had your priorities right, you'd worry more about wrinkles and less about your uterus, for crying out loud. After all, have you ever heard a man compliment a woman for having a pretty uterus? Didn't think so.So quit sending Rick Perry mixed signals. Everyone knows you're just playing hard to get. You lead Governor Perry on by voting for him then you turn around and treat him real sorry-like. You know what happens to girls who lead guys, don't you? They get what they deserve and they have no one to blame but themselves. And what more could you want in a man? Governor Perry is both easy on the eyes and he doesn't want you to think one single bit. You're lucky he hasn't found anyone else who will have him. God knows he's tried. And rumor has it he's laying the groundwork to go a' courting again -- this time outside of Texas. See? You've done run him off, practically. You need to start acting right before it's too late. Show Governor Perry a little gratitude for his commitment to relieving you of the heavy burden of being responsible for all those confusing personal choices. Look, I know this is a complicated topic and I'm sure you have much more rewarding things to think about -- like pedicures, malls, what's for dinner, and stuff like that. So, I've made it easy for you: I've taken the liberty of developing a three-step plan to show Governor Perry how much you appreciate him. You may be thinking that since the Texas Two Step is the Official State Dance, a three-step plan is one step too many. I have two things to say to you about that: Thing one -- I've already told you to leave the thinking to the menfolk. Just look at all the trouble it's gotten you in this far. Thing two: After the scene you caused the other night at the Capitol, you can't expect to just waltz back into Governor Perry's good graces. It's going to take some extra fancy footwork on your part. From this moment forward, you're going to stop all of your bellyaching and hell raising and let Governor Perry wear the pants. That means you have to give him the respect that goes along with his manly gender by consulting him before making any decision that involves your lady parts. Is it your time of the month? Before you go to the store, call the Governor's office to ask what kind of feminine hygiene products God wants you to buy. And don't insult him with a superficial ""tampon or sanitary napkin"" question. This isn't some ""boxer or brief"" conversation-starting game. You're trying to rebuild trust, not break the ice. Prove that you want a deep and meaningful relationship with the governor by getting his input on everything from brands to product features. Kotex or Playtex? Scented or unscented? Plastic or cardboard applicator? But please be considerate and structure your questions so they contain only two choices at a time, because sometimes Governor Perry has a hard time remembering what the third thing is. And whatever you do, don't embarrass yourself by asking whether you should buy pads with or without wings. Wings are always the right answer. You know the old saying: Every time a new state law is passed that further infringes upon a woman's right to choose, a Republican gets his wings. Need to schedule an appointment with your OB/GYN? Don't be all pushy-like and do that all by yourself. Be courteous. Call Governor Perry to invite him to come with you. But if he says no, don't argue with him -- he's a very busy man. Go ahead and schedule your appointment anyway, then make sure you email him all of the details like the date, time, location, and reason for appointment. That way even if he can't go, he will still feel respected and included.Thinking about having intimate relations? Hold your horses. First ask Governor Perry to pray over whether this is the right decision for you. But make sure you give him plenty of time. It's summer and Texas is still in the middle of a drought. That means Governor Perry probably won't get to your prayer request until after he's done praying for rain -- and there's no telling how much longer that will take. He started praying for that last summer and he still hasn't had much luck. (But don't judge -- that's not a reflection on either Governor Perry or God. After all, they are both very busy men.)If you religiously follow the three steps above, you have a good chance of patching things up with Governor Perry. Look, I know deep down you really want him. Why else would you repeatedly vote for him? And since he's already yours, you may as well stop fighting him and just let him have his way. When it comes to things you cannot avoid, you would do well to pay heed to the wise words of Clayton Williams, another Texas Republican who cared deeply about Texas ladies, their lady parts, and bad weather: ""If it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy it.""Editor's note: This post is satirical."

Hammami pointed to a multitude of other barriers to entrepreneurship, including the difficulty in getting financing and the inability to travel freely in certain parts of the region.Mona Hammami on the barriers female entrepreneurs in the Middle East faceHowever, many of the obstacles preventing women from joining the workforce in larger numbers sounded similar to those being grappled with in the Western world. Are women in the MENA region also asking “Can women have it all?” It’s unclear, but certainly the men who hope to employ them are.“The working world is not friendly to women,” said PepsiCo CEO of Asia, Middle East, and Africa Saad Abdul-Latif. “There is a work-life balance. Women in the Arab world are expected to be a working woman and take care of the home. I think the biggest enabler is having policies that make the workplace friendly and adaptive.”Saad Abdul-Latif offers ways to make the workplace more adaptive to a wife and mother in the Middle East. Hammami suggests better paternity and maternity leave. Abdul-Latif offers flextime and work-from-home scenarios as potential solutions. As the Middle East looks to build its infrastructure and economy, it will rely more and more on its entire workforce. Whether they come from private industry or public entities, forward-thinking policies will need to be enacted to make that possible. "
5,BUSINESS,Paula Deen and the Dilemma of Celebrity Endorsements,"Sam Fiorella, Contributor
Partner, Sensei Marketing; Author, Influence Marketing",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/celebrity-endorsement-paula-deen_us_5bb2f88ae4b0480ca65fef1f,"If the public is going to hold celebrities to such high standards, should we not also hold the businesses that endorse them to similar standards?",2013-06-30,TODAY -- Pictured: Paula Deen appears on NBC News' 'Today' show -- (Photo by: Peter Kramer/NBC/NBC NewsWire via Getty Images),https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb2f88a1f0000df0023b84d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"I, along with most North Americans, have been following the Paula Deen story these past few weeks with morbid curiosity. For those of you who've been living under a rock this past week, it's the story of Lance Armstrong or Tiger Woods all over again. Celebrities are created or hired to represent a brand in the public space and drive media attention and revenue for their sponsors. Then, as most people do, they show a human weakness to which the public takes exception. The celebrities are unceremoniously fired in an attempt by those who have been milking their celebrity to distance themselves from the very creatures they created. In Ms. Deen's case, during a legal deposition for a lawsuit filed by a former employee for a discriminatory and hostile work environment, she admitted to using the N-word during an alleged robbery by a black man. Of course, this was a Godsend to the legal team deposing her, who I'm sure tripped over themselves to make this information available to every news and social media outlet they could find. The explosion of public scorn was immediate and powerful, like a digital atomic bomb set off at the heart of the Internet. The response from brands which hired or sponsored Ms. Deen was equally quick and certain. She was quickly fired from The Food Network, which she was widely credited for creating with her friendly and engaging persona. Brands such as Sears, J.C. Penney, Walgreens, Wal-Mart, Target, Home Depot, Novo Nordisk, Smithfield Foods, and Caesars Entertainment all joined the The Food Network in running for the hills to distance themselves from the controversy. Her upcoming book, Paula Deen's New Testament: 250 Favorite Recipes, All Lightened Up, was unapologetically canceled.Did the Food Network Have a Choice? Negative public commentary on the network's Facebook page blew up with mostly negative comments, something that in today's socially-connected world, few brands have the fortitude or desire to fend off. An even bigger impact was felt on the corporate site, where the comments section below many of Paula Deen's recipes were taken over by those posting about the issue -- both pro-Deen and anti-Deen. The Food Network's flagship brand site became a political and social forum instead of a vehicle for the discussion of food and cooking. When any employee or hired spokesperson creates such distress which affects the brand's public image, does the business have a choice but to distance itself? Is it the right thing to do? For the most part, the public seemed to support brands firing Ms. Deen but there remain many who are throwing their support behind her and against the brands that walked away from the woman whose celebrity they used to drive so much profit. The Food Network was quite happy to make a dollar off of Ms. Deen when she was America's darling but quick to drop her at the first sign of controversy. In all those years, do you honestly believe that no one there understood her background or her religious, political, and social views? Should they not also receive some of the public's scorn? As they profited from Deen in the good times should they not stand by her during the bad times too? We expect this of our friends and family; why do we make exceptions for businesses? Who Creates These Celebrities? Whether they're hiring celebrities to host television shows or hiring them as spokespeople, businesses spend an exorbitant amount of money to create and promote the image of the icons that we're encouraged to admire. They create intricate cross-media promotions using branding, advertising, and public relations firms to create this ""perfect image,"" an image we should worship and aspire to be. If they don't create the icon status, they certainly endorse, encourage, and even promote it. Businesses are making a public declaration that these personas are representatives of their brands. When their chosen idols fail to live up to the public's moral expectations -- the very standard that the brand helped to establish -- businesses are quick to wash their hands of any wrongdoing and distance themselves by disassociating their brand with the disgraced spokesperson. With the dash of a pen, they absolve themselves of any moral or legal wrongs. In most cases, the public applauds the brands for taking a stand, for offering their outrage as a sign of solidarity with current popular opinion. Overnight, these businesses go from the target of boycotts and public scorn to being celebrated for their moral stance. Just like that, they walk away from their part in building the false idol, while profiting from their actions. Should Brands Not Be Held Accountable Too?Why are sports athletes not forced to take a drug test before brands hire them as spokespeople, and then continue regular testing during their employment? Should their backgrounds not be vetted and potential red flags identified in advance? This is a common practice for many businesses when hiring senior executives or others in key internal or public-facing roles; why is it not mandatory for businesses that create and hire celebrity spokespeople?Should the public not also focus their resentment towards brands for their failure to do so? Should the public not write angry letters and boycott the brands that fire their fallen spokespeople because they did not do their job in the first place? They build the pedestal on which most celebrity spokespeople sit, and then create the fanfare that draws our attention and worship towards them. Why are celebrities not given personality or morality tests to determine their stance on race, abortion, or gay marriage before being hired to represent the brand? Given how quick the public is to condemn their idols for missteps, should this not be a common practice today? The reality is that the decision to hire spokespeople is often based more on their ability to promote or sell product than to actually represent the cultural identity of the corporation behind the brand. All too often, businesses are well aware of a spokesperson's affinity for violence, a propensity to commit adultery, or controversial views on race and religion. The business gambles that its PR team and handlers will keep celebrity spokespeople in check, at least long enough for the brand to see a return on its investment. If the public is going to hold celebrities to such high standards, should we not also hold the businesses that endorse them to similar standards? Was it not their responsibility to properly vet those they offer up as role models? And when these fallen idols are expected to make public apologies in order to win back our favor, should their sponsors not also be asked to perform those same acts of contrition? Where do you stand on this debate?Are brands that create and profit from celebrity spokespeople equally responsible to the public for their mistakes? Should these brands not stand by their spokespeople, to work together to ask for the public's forgiveness and rebuild the trust and relationship lost?"
