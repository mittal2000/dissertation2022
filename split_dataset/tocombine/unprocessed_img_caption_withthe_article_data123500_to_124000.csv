Bundy had stopped paying fees for grazing his cattle on the government land and officials said he had ignored court orders.Anti-government groups, right-wing politicians and gun-rights activists camped around Bundy's ranch to support him in a standoff that tapped into long-simmering anger in Nevada and other Western states, where vast tracts of land are owned and governed by federal agencies.The bureau had called in a team of armed rangers to Nevada to seize the 1,000 head of cattle on Saturday but backed down in the interests of safety.""Based on information about conditions on the ground and in consultation with law enforcement, we have made a decision to conclude the cattle gather because of our serious concern about the safety of employees and members of the public,"" the bureau's director, Neil Kornze, said in a statement.The protesters, who at the height of the standoff numbered about 1,000, met the news with applause. Then they quickly advanced on the metal pens where the cattle confiscated earlier in the week were being held.After consultations with the rancher's family, the bureau decided to release the cattle it had rounded up, and the crowd began to disperse.""This is what I prayed for,"" said Margaret Houston, one of Bundy's sisters. ""We are so proud of the American people for being here with us and standing with us.""A number of Bundy's supporters, who included militia members from California, Idaho and other states, dressed in camouflage and carried rifles and sidearms. During the stand-off, some chanted ""open that gate"" and ""free the people.""A man who identified himself as Scott, 43, said he had traveled from Idaho along with two fellow militia members to support Bundy.""If we don't show up everywhere, there is no reason to show up anywhere,"" said the man, dressed in camouflage pants and a black flak jacket crouched behind a concrete highway barrier, holding an AR-15 rifle. ""I'm ready to pull the trigger if fired upon,"" Scott said. LONG-SIMMERING ANGERThe dispute between Bundy and federal land managers began in 1993 when he stopped paying monthly fees of about $1.35 per cow-calf pair to graze public lands that are also home to imperiled animals such as the Mojave Desert tortoise. The government also claims Bundy has ignored cancellation of his grazing leases and defied federal court orders to remove his cattle.""We won the battle,"" said Ammon Bundy, one of the rancher's sons.The bureau said Cliven Bundy still owes taxpayers more than $1 million, which includes both grazing fees and penalties, and that it would work to resolve the matter administratively and through the court system.Jack Kay, a professor of communication at Eastern Michigan University and an expert on militias, said the federal government did well to step back from the conflict. ""These things tend to escalate, someone looks like they're going to pull the trigger and then something happens,"" he said.Nevada Governor Brian Sandoval, who earlier in the week suggested the federal government had created an atmosphere of ""intimidation,"" said in a statement on Saturday he welcomed the bureau's action. ""Given the circumstances, today's outcome is the best we could have hoped for,"" he said.Hundreds of Bundy supporters, some heavily armed, had camped on the road leading to his ranch in a high desert spotted with sagebrush and mesquite trees. Some held signs reading ""Americans united against government thugs,"" while others were calling the rally the ""Battle of Bunkerville,"" a reference to a American Revolutionary War battle of Bunker Hill in Boston.The large crowd at one point blocked all traffic on Interstate 15. Later, as lanes opened up, motorists honked to support the demonstrators and gave them thumbs-up signs.In an interview prior to the bureau's announcement, Bundy said he was impressed by the level of support he had received.""I'm excited that we are really fighting for our freedom. We've been losing it for a long time,"" Bundy said.But an official with an environmental group that had notified the government it would sue unless federal land managers sought to protect tortoises on the grazing allotment used by Bundy's cattle expressed outrage at the end of the cattle roundup.""The sovereign militias are ruling the day,"" said Rob Mrowka, senior scientist with the Center for Biological Diversity. ""Now that this precedent has been set and they're emboldened by the government's capitulation, what's to stop them from applying the same tactics and threats elsewhere?""Roger Taylor, retired district manager with the Bureau of Land Management in Arizona, also said the agency's decision to release the cattle will have repercussions.""The (agency) is going to be in a worse situation where they will have a much more difficult time getting those cattle off the land and getting Bundy in compliance with regulations,"" he said.

A massive mudslide on March 22 has killed at least fourteen and left many missing. (Photo by Office of the Governor via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb154c6240000500096bd5b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Eric M. JohnsonOSO, Wash., April 13 (Reuters) - Watching the now murky river from his kitchen window, Bill Best speaks in low tones of neighbors buried by a massive mudslide, where damage to salmon and steelhead trout spawning beds only adds to the grief in a rural Washington state community with deep ties to the land.""The river's extremely important. We just thoroughly love this relatively natural, unspoiled river environment. It's why we are here,"" the 73-year-old avid fly fisherman said. ""Hopefully in 20 to 30 years, it will be back to what it sort of used to be.""With the death toll from the March 22 mudslide at 36 and rising after millions of cubic yards of earth spliced with trees buried a neighborhood near Oso, the ecological damage to one of the nation's most storied steelhead fly fishing waters is already evident.The roughly 45-mile (70-kilometer) north fork of the Stillaguamish River has been stained a dark gray-green by silt and nearly blocked by a mud dam, and a pumping system meant to aid search efforts is sending water mixed with sewage and chemicals back into the river.Migrating salmonids, including federally protected Chinook salmon and steelhead trout, along with their eggs in the river's gravel beds and emerged smolt have surely been killed or will be damaged, state Department of Ecology spill responder Dick Walker said.Soil samples won't be collected until search efforts end, but the amount of toxic chemicals leaking from households and cars crushed by the slide is relatively low compared to the volume of water, Walker said in an interview.Yet silt, which suffocates spawning beds and harms fish gills as well as insect life, is likely to pile up down river in a Puget Sound estuary used in valley agriculture, and any increased water toxicity could possibly also harm shellfish production, scientists and an industry group say.""It's going to have an effect on both the adults trying to swim upstream and small smolt salmon trying to swim downstream,"" Walker said, adding a monitoring station down river has already found damage to migrating smolts.Between 1,200 and 1,600 Chinook return to the river each year, while steelhead number in the hundreds, said Bill Blake, co-chair of the Stillaguamish Watershed Council, adding it is too early to know the extent of damage to fish populations. CLEAR AS CRYSTALOn a recent afternoon in Arlington, near the disaster zone, teenagers were hanging out on the river bank and residents jogged and pushed strollers over a bridge where the date of the mudslide was inked on yellow ribbons tied to a fence.Beneath the bridge, flecks of splintered wood floated in the north fork's darkened waters as it merged with the healthier south fork, a bright teal.""What struck me at once was the wonderful transparency of the water,"" Western novelist Zane Gray wrote of one of the river's tributaries where he hooked a steelhead nearly a century ago. ""Deer Creek was the most beautiful trout water I had ever seen. Clear as crystal, cold as ice.""In 1949, the north fork, whose fish have languished from the effects of logging, especially in the mid-20th century, became the first fly fishing-only steelhead water in the world, according to Greg Thomas' Flyfisher's Guide to Washington.Officials beginning to envision flood-control and rehab schemes have until summer before Chinook salmon begin pushing from the salty Puget Sound into the river system to spawn, Blake said.This fragile lifecycle is jeopardized by the higher priority of searching for victims among a toxic brew of raw sewage, cleaning products, gasoline, and other contaminants among the mud and splintered trees, Blake said.""We are in crisis mode along with everybody else,"" said Eric White, chairman of the Stillaguamish Tribe of Indians. ""Spiritually, we rely on that river.""The tribe - whose name means ""the river people"" - welcomes the arrival of migrating fish in a ""first salmon"" ceremony and has spent decades working to restore and protect salmon runs. It has traditional fishing rights protected by treaty, White said.""You don't want to be selfish or disrespectful to the lives that are lost so you have to figure out when to talk about this stuff. 'This river is destroyed' and 'our treaty right' - that's second,"" White said.The tribe is planning to use federal emergency funds for river rehabilitation, White said.Blake, who has seen three mudslides near the river - in 1967, 2006 and this latest one, which killed his friend - said pumps or a series of small ditches installed near the site to be eventually replaced by a new wetlands reserve could help regulate water levels.Meantime, a temporary berm is being constructed to reduce flood impacts, Snohomish County officials say.""The landscape was changed completely in four minutes,"" Blake said. ""In a hard way, it reconnects people with the potential of nature. What can be beautiful one minute is also life threatening the next."" (Reporting by Eric M. Johnson; Editing by Cynthia Johnston)"
