The rate of severely late credit card payments dipped nationally in the first three months of the year, even as banks issued more cards to borrowers with less-than-stellar credit, according to an analysis by credit reporting agency TransUnion.

Our system of interstates didn't exist and neither did Disney World, and cars weren't as common... so those summer vacations that we might take for granted today were not even dreamt of by our grandparents or great-grandparents. People were born and raised in a small town, and they lived much of their lives there.When they needed a loan, they would go to the local bank and talk to the owner -- probably someone they knew from school (and whose parents had known their parents!). Over a coffee and a handshake, the terms of a loan or a mortgage would be struck. You borrowed money and you paid it back because your good name and reputation were on the line and you had a relationship with the people you borrowed from.But times have changed. People move around a lot more now. Banks are bigger, with numerous branches all over the place. And people need a lot more credit now than they did those many years ago. So lenders needed a new way to measure creditworthiness in this changing culture. That's when an engineer named Bill fair and a mathematician named Earl Isaac come into the story. They started the Fair Isaac Corporation, and in 1956 they developed a model for measuring a person's credit risk. Their algorithm created a credit score and the Fair Isaac Corporation score - the ""F.I.Co."" or ""FICO"" score -- is what most lenders rely on today to help them determine whether or not they lend someone money.When you go into your bank or lending institution to borrow money, the lender pulls your FICO score from each company and then the ""discard"" the top and bottom score and base their lending decision on the middle FICO score. Although the FICO score itself doesn't ""tell"" a lender whether or not to lend, most lenders provide guidelines to their staff so that they only lend when a FICO score falls within certain parameters.The 4-letter ""F word"" you need to know about is FICO -- it's the score that determines if a lender will lend you money and how much they'll lend you and at what interest rate. Some people feel that using an algorithm instead of a relationship to borrow money doesn't sound very nice but I think it's a good way to ensure that everyone who qualifies for credit can get it fairly. FICO erases the problem of only borrowing if you know the right people.The world has changed: We no longer borrow money on a handshake from people we know. Instead, our ability to borrow money was decided in 1956 by an engineer and a mathematician. But the good news is: You can improve your credit score by learning about what factors make up into the FICO score and go to MyFICO.com to get your FICO score so you have a starting point to start fixing your credit!Email me a credit question: JeanneKelly@Kgroupconsulting.com"
2,PARENTING,Why Are Young Children Helpful?,"Art Markman, Ph.D., Contributor

An easy way to engage a toddler in play is to start to work on something and make it look like you need help. Often, they will come over immediately and work to help you with whatever you are doing.",2012-09-28,Kids playing with plastic blocks - two boys and girl,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c5b4c1f00005100212fde.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Little kids like to help out. An easy way to engage a toddler in play is to start to work on something and make it look like you need help. Often, they will come over immediately and work to help you with whatever you are doing. The psychologist Michael Tomasello has gotten interested in what makes young kids want to be helpful. There are three explanations that he addresses across two sets of studies. One possibility is that children learn to be helpful, because they are rewarded for their helpful behavior. A second possibility is that children enjoy being helpful to others, and so they help others to experience that positive feeling. A third possibility is that children are motivated to want people who need to get help to get help, whether they provide that help or not.In one study by Felix Warneken and Michael Tomasello, published in 2008 in Developmental Psychology, they gave young children (around 20 months of age) the opportunity to help an experimenter who dropped an object. For helping, some children were given a reward. Others were praised. A third group was not given a reward or praise. Then, children were given a chance to be helpful again. Children who received a reward were much less likely to help again than those who were praised or received no reward.This finding suggests that children help because there is something about being helpful that they enjoy. When they are given a reward, it undermines this intrinsic enjoyment of being helpful. A second study by Robert Hepach, Amrisha Vais and Michael Tomasello in the September, 2012 issue of Psychological Science explored exactly what it is that children enjoy. This study took advantage of the observation that when people are involved in a situation, the pupils of their eyes dilate. So, pupil size can be used as a measure of involvement. In this study, the children were 22-month-olds. The children saw an adult sitting in a small model house sitting at a table. Then, they were taken outside the house and they looked in the window. The window was actually a computer monitor showing the adult trying to build a tower. At the end, they were trying to pick up a block that was out of reach. While they watched the monitor, their pupils were measured. In general, children's pupils dilate because they want to help the adult.Now, the children were brought back into the house by their parents. Some children were allowed to help the adult (which they did). Some children watched as a second adult helped the first adult reach the block. A third group was held by their parents and not allowed to help.Afterward, the children watched an unrelated video on the computer monitor and their pupils were measured again. The children who helped and the children who saw another adult help both had smaller pupils than the children who were not allowed to help. That is, the children who were not allowed to help were still concerned that the adult in the house needed help. The other two groups of children were content that the adult had been helped, whether or not they were the one who did the helping.Putting all this together, then, young children seem to get enjoyment out of seeing others get help. When possible, they will try to help themselves, but it seems to be enough that someone helps. From these studies alone, it is not clear whether this desire to help is innate, or whether children learn this helpfulness from observing others in their first two years of life. Of course, if you are the parent of a teenager, the real question is, ""What happens to that intrinsic enjoyment of being helpful?"""

More and more people are channeling their energies into living a well-rounded life, and I believe that this is partially because we, as a society, are changing the definition of what constitutes a ""worthwhile life.""Like most people, I used to believe that working hard and earning a good living were key to a successful life. Although these things are still important to me, I realized the importance of health and happiness, that to really ""live well"" I had to be healthy and strive to obtain enjoyment from everything that I do. I see these values reflected in my clients, too -- successful men and women who are looking beyond their careers and finances towards a healthier, happier, more balanced and more fulfilling life.There are barriers to making these changes, the most common of which are stress and anxiety. On its own, stress can have serious repercussions on your physical health and anxiety can make it extremely hard to see the positive aspects of our lives. When paired, they can be an overwhelming combination and even in small doses have the potential to seriously impact your quality of life.Exercise Can Help!Improving your mental health can be accomplished many ways, but exercise is often a forgotten option. Below are a few of the benefits that regular exercise can have on your mental health and wellbeing:Relaxation -- Yes, exercise can relax you! Misplaced energy can cause anxiety, but when you exercise regularly, the severity of your physical anxiety can be diminished.Build a Healthy Body -- Getting sick -- or the fear of it -- can be a huge source of stress and anxiety. If you're in good shape physically, it's one less thing to worry about and when you're fit, strong and energized, it's much easier to deal with whatever life throws at you.Body Image -- If you look good, you're more inclined to feel good. Fact! Self-doubt and low self-esteem could potentially develop into problems with stress and anxiety. Exercise is an ideal way to improve your self-image, and feeling confident about yourself can go a long way toward reducing stress and anxiety.It's Chemical -- When you exercise, you release endorphins. Endorphins are the chemicals that make you feel good, and releasing them into your brain leads to a nice euphoric feeling. This feeling can help break you out of your anxious state and provides a helpful break from the day's stresses.Exercise is by no means a wonder cure for stress and anxiety, but it does have the potential to reduce their effects, giving you a better shot at getting more enjoyment out of life.Jamie Gallowaywww.trainwithjamie.comFor more by Jamie Galloway, click here.For more on fitness and exercise, click here."

This panel reviewed a large body of research on drinking patterns among adult men and women.,2012-09-28,Group of friends - men and women of different ethnicity - having fun in a disco or nightclub,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c59ba2400005000532975.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What You Don't Know Can Hurt YouThe United States Preventive Services Task Force, a government-appointed independent panel of experts, just issued a report and an advisory that all sensible men and women would do well to take heed of. This panel reviewed a large body of research on drinking patterns among adult men and women. Their report focuses not on the relatively small percentage of people whose drinking is so severe that it qualifies them for a formal diagnosis of alcohol abuse or alcoholism; rather, it took aim at those men and women who are neither abusers nor alcoholics but who nevertheless drink more than the limits recommended by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Those limits are as follows:• For men, a maximum of 14 drinks per week and 4 drinks on any one day. • For women, a maximum of 7 drinks per week and 3 drinks on any one day.Drinking in excess of the above does not make an individual an alcoholic. By the same token it makes them more than an occasional or ""social"" drinker. In terms of what I call the drinking spectrum this group falls somewhere in the ""almost alcoholic"" zone as depicted in the following diagram:There are probably millions of men and women in the almost alcoholic zone. Many of them, if confronted with the above drinking guidelines, might nod. But when asked to estimate just how many drinks they actually consume in any given week, these same men and women may be shocked to realize that they do indeed exceed the recommended limits. Of this group quite a few will argue that the recommended limits are either unreasonable, or at the very least outdated.Obvious vs. Subtle ConsequencesPeople may feel that the recommended limits are unreasonable or outdated for one obvious reason: They don't see any connection between their own drinking behavior and any physical or emotional consequences. In a word, they feel safe. But is this true?According to Susan Curry, a member of the panel that issued the above report, it was designed in part to help people who do drink above the limits to avoid moving farther along the drinking spectrum into actual abuse or even alcoholism, at which point consequences become obvious. According to Dr. Curry, ""This says, 'Let's pay attention' ... You may want to take a look at how you are drinking. If it escalates you're at risk, but you can change that now.""Drinking at the almost alcoholic level is not risk-free. There are consequences. The problem is that people don't move along the drinking spectrum quickly; consequently, the consequences of their drinking typically appear insidiously, often over a period of years. These consequences can be more subtle than obvious. They may begin with disturbed sleep and a progressive loss of energy and stamina. This may lead to a low grade depression, or early signs of medical problems such as hypertension or diabetes. Drinking at the almost alcoholic level is also associated with increased risk for breast and esophageal cancers. Of course, it may take years for these cancers to be diagnosed, and the victims may not ""connect the dots"" between their eventual illness and their drinking.""Shifting Left""The good news that Dr. Curry and the panel had to share is that, for all those men and women who look at their drinking and realize that they have drifted into the ""almost alcoholic"" zone, solutions are available. They do not necessarily need to abstain. Rather, they can avail themselves of a number of strategies designed to help them ""shift left"" on the drinking spectrum, back toward normal social drinking, where the risks are much lower.The panel reported that professional counseling can help men and women who are in the almost alcoholic zone to reduce their drinking. For those who would prefer to try their hand at self-help before considering counseling, a guide for assessing where they lie on the drinking spectrum, along with solutions for ""shifting left"" can be found in Almost Alcoholic: Is My (or My Loved One's) Drinking a Problem?.For more by Joseph Nowinski, Ph.D., click here.For more on addiction and recovery, click here."

And for their sixth season, it's into the archives...The highly and hotly anticipated Converse Missoni Archive Project set to launch at Colette  this Friday, will feature 20 one-of-a-kind pairs of Converse (10 pairs of Auckland Racer and 10 pairs of Pro Leather) crafted from unique archival Missoni fabrics from 1994 to present day.According to Converse designer Matt Sleep, ""We decided that it would be great to do a project that really celebrated the vast archive of Missoni's textiles, as well as showcasing the breadth of their craftsmanship both past and present. We chatted, selected a variety and then made some killer one-off pieces of art!""Just how rare are these shoes? Though Missoni is known for its multitude of textiles, Sleep states that, ""what narrowed our search was making sure there was enough yardage of each for us to be able to make the specific pair of shoes needed. We identified a shortlist of 30 and narrowed it down to 20 from there."" The limited edition shoes will be presented on a specially designed sculptural installation created by artist Gary Card , that not only compliments the Converse ""Star Chevron,"" but also the iconic Missoni monochromatic zig-zag knit fabric.This project also features a hand-numbered hardback book produced in limited quantities, each bond in the same terracotta canvas that lines every pair in the collection.Available to purchase when the doors open this Friday at Colette in Paris, the launch of the Archive Project is definitely a breath of fresh air from the typical party launch. After all, fashion week is just party after party and with no discernibility, but if you're a well-heeled fashion editor who wants these extremely limited edition shoes made of fabrics you'll most likely never see again, you'll be dragging yourself out of bed before noon to get your hands on a pair. Converse Missoni Archives shoes are €400."
