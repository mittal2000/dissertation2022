The scripted, six-episode series said to be titled ""Vital Signs"" will be semi-autobiographical, with each episode structured ""Master of None""-style around a specific theme that Dre's character will explore. While each episode will only last a half hour, the show is more of a dark drama than a comedy. It has ""no shortage of violence or sex,"" writes The Hollywood Reporter.A representative for Apple declined to comment, and a representative for Dr. Dre did not immediately respond to our request.Though it's unclear when we can expect the first season to debut, we have reason to believe that it will be distributed via iTunes or Apple Music. The tech company is rumored to have pressed pause on plans to debut its own streaming service -- a combination of Netflix and live TV -- after Apple executives were noticed meeting with Hollywood studio heads last summer.Also on HuffPost:"

The boys are with Bernie,” Steinem said.The feminist icon later clarified her comments, making it clear that she supports all young feminists and explained her statement was ""misinterpreted as implying young women aren't serious in their politics."" But the fact remains that there  are  some people who believe young women are complacent when it comes to politics. While young female Bernie Sanders supporters are accused of seeking male approval, Hillary Clinton supporters are accused of ""voting with their vaginas."" A new video from Fusion is proving both of these theories wrong.In the video above, Katie McDonough of Fusion walked around the streets of New York City to ask ""the question on every young woman's mind this election: where dem boys at?""The tongue-in-cheek clip perfectly dismantles the idea that young women's political beliefs are at all dictated by what men think. Some of the best question and answers included:""[Are you supporting Bernie Sanders] because... you've seen a lot of boys at his events?""""No, not at all. That's not the reason that I'm voting for him.""""Who do you think has cuter supporters? Hillary or Bernie?""""If I'm going to a Bernie Sanders event it's for his ideas, and to listen to what he's proposing for the United States.""""About, like, who you should date?

He was armed with a machete and knife and lunged at a police officer before he was fatally shot, media said, citing law enforcement officials.At least five people inside the Middle Eastern-food restaurant were hurt, including one person who was in critical condition, officials said.The suspect had walked into the restaurant and argued with an employee before leaving, returning with the machete a short time later and attacking customers, police said.The attack appeared to be random.""There was no rhyme or reason as to who he was going after,” Columbus Police Department spokesman Sergeant Rich Weiner told WCMH-TV.The FBI was also investigating, the Columbus Dispatch newspaper reported.

""My Virtual Gay Boyfriend"" creator Mike Amerson developed the game in response to the queer community asking him for their own version of Amerson's other games ""My Virtual Boyfriend"" and ""My Virtual Girlfriend,"" which catered to a straight audience.The video game functions in levels, with the trajectory of the game operating around the mechanics of how real life relationships work after a player customizes their A.I. The early stages of the game involve a lot of small talk and flirting with your A.I., where the player determines the interests of the character and tries to develop a sense of compatibility. As the game progresses, the player does things for their A.I. that makes their heart meter fill -- with a full heart meter meaning a ""level up.""Alternatively, the player can actually negatively impact their relationship with the A.I., which can lead to a break-up.""The game is different things for different people, but my intent when creating it was for people to just have fun and be entertained by it,"" Amerson told The Huffington Post. ""The game focuses on a relationship and, just as in real life, it can go either way. Sometimes it works out, other times it doesn't -- which is reflected in the game too.""The A.I. will eventually declares its love for the player at level 35 -- that's only if the player makes it this far and the relationship doesn't result in break-up. After reaching level 35, the game either ends or can keep going with the A.I. continuing to level up -- though there is little new content for the player after reaching this point.As for the critics that would claim the game is actually negatively impacting the ability of queer men to develop meaningful, healthy relationships, Amerson says he sees it quite differently.""We all want to be loved, and no matter how advanced or realistic an A.I. is, it cannot offer the authenticity that a human can,"" Amerson continues. ""Not that all humans are authentic all of the time, but in a romantic engagement with that person we certainly hope they are being genuine. The game employs a bit of flirty romance intermixed with some humor to keep the mood light and fun. If anything I think this game contributes to relationships as you have to learn to practice patience and compromise to get to higher levels -- just like in real life.""Want to decide for yourself?

4,POLITICS,Another Debate Kicks Off With A Sharp Clash Over Health Care,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-sanders-health_us_56bd4955e4b0c3c55050c122,Bernie Sanders thinks single-payer can work here. Hillary Clinton doesn't.,2016-02-12,Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton got seriously wonky on Thursday night.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56bd49fb1f00007f00217e00.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For the second Democratic presidential debate in a row, health care came up right away. And for the second debate in a row, what followed was a serious, substantive discussion that put the different perspectives of Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton into sharp relief.In the end, their big dispute wasn't really over whether a single-payer system is a good idea in principle. It was whether such a system could actually work in the U.S.To review: Sanders wants to create an entirely new health care system, replacing the current patchwork of private and public plans with one, government-run insurance program. The insurance he envisions would wipe out nearly all out-of-pocket spending, and give government more power to set prices, in order to hold down the cost of health care.To finance this plan, Sanders would impose new taxes, some on the wealthy and some on the middle class. But the typical American would actually save money, Sanders says, because the new tax burden would be less than what the typical American now pays in private insurance premiums, deductibles, and co-pays.Clinton prefers to build incrementally on the Affordable Care Act, which President Barack Obama signed into law six years ago and has now reduced the proportion of Americans without health insurance to about 10 percent. She has called for modestly improving protection from out-of-pocket costs and giving government more leverage with the prescription drug industry.These are not major initiatives and Clinton has not specified how, exactly, she would get the country to 100 percent coverage -- something a single-payer plan would in theory achieve right away, because it would enroll people automatically. But Clinton has warned that creating a single-payer system would be highly disruptive, since it would mean changing everybody's insurance. Clinton also has warned that Sanders’ plan would almost certainly cost a great deal more than Sanders says -- an argument with which most (but not all) well-known health policy experts agree. As a result, Clinton says, the number of people worse off after the transition could be much larger than Sanders has indicated.The (somewhat) novel twist in Thursday’s discussion came in the sharp, but respectful back-and-forth that followed the initial question. In order to defend his claim about savings from single-payer, Sanders noted that every other country in the world manages to cover nearly all people while paying less -- and frequently far less -- than the U.S. does. He is absolutely correct about that. It's proof that, over the long haul, universal coverage doesn't require higher spending.But Clinton had an answer ready: Most of those other countries built their universal coverage programs decades ago, as their health care systems were first evolving. It would be far more difficult to impose such a system on the existing U.S. health care infrastructure, she said.To take one example: A plan like Sanders envisions would almost certainly require deep cuts in payments to hospitals. The hospitals would fight those cuts and, if somehow the cuts made it through Congress, many would probably suffer financially -- leading to shortages and closures. That would cause either hardship, a severe political backlash, or some combination of the two.The plan that Sanders has sketched out will appeal to many voters. And while the systems abroad with single-payer have their pluses and minuses, overall they really do perform quite well. But the transitional hazards that Clinton described are very real, and something that might give many Americans serious pause.More coverage of the Democratic debate:"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) refused to take former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s “yes” for an answer again when it came to their respective positions on Social Security, a topic that has become a concern among progressive Democratic primary voters.Clinton pledged Friday that she would not cut Social Security benefits, claiming it was a reiteration of a position she has held all along. She was clearly responding, however, to rising pressure from progressive activists and the Sanders campaign.The Sanders campaign did not accept her pledge as sufficiently detailed then, and candidate Sanders refused to do so again on Thursday. Sanders faulted Clinton for failing to embrace applying Social Security taxes to earnings of $250,000 or more. The Vermont senator has proposed legislation that would do just that.“Here's an area where Secretary Clinton and I believe we have a difference,” Sanders said.“I would hope that you would come on board and say this is the simple and straightforward thing to do: We're asking the top one and a half percent including passive income to start paying a little bit more so that the elderly and disabled vets in this country can live with security and dignity,” Sanders later added.Currently, Social Security receives payroll tax contributions on the first $118,600 in wages an individual earns per year.Clinton denied that she has major differences with Sanders on the matter.“I think it's fair to say we don't have a disagreement,” Clinton insisted. “We both believe there has to be more money going into the Social Security system.”Clinton said she is considering Sanders’ proposal -- a provision sometimes nicknamed “scrap the cap” -- but is also looking at other options, such as taxing “passive,” or unearned, income that currently does not go toward the popular social insurance program.Sanders said his plan to lift the cap would tax unearned income too, but Clinton argued that he has not laid out a plan to do so yet.The candidates tangled on the nature of expanding benefits as well. Sanders would increase benefits across the board and make targeted increases for vulnerable groups, whereas Clinton has said she would prioritize vulnerable groups, such as elderly widows.Also on HuffPost:"

Garner recalls her daughter asking. ""And I had to explain to her that it’s not really over.""The video continues with images of Garner caring for Alyssa and protesting the death of her father, Eric Garner, as she explains the pain of her father's loss and her efforts to change a system in which law enforcement has the power to take black lives frivolously.Sanders is absent until the second half of the ad, when he appears in clips that show him uttering condemnations of an institutionally racist criminal justice system. “It is not acceptable to me that we have seen young black men walk down streets in this country, be beaten and be killed unjustly,"" Sanders is shown saying.NBC News reported that the Sanders campaign has purchased national cable airtime for a two-minute version of the ad, but that several cable networks refused to air the full-length video.The ad comes as Sanders and Hillary Clinton fight for Democratic primary wins in states such as South Carolina, where receiving a large share of the African-American vote is crucial to victory.Clinton has enjoyed greater popularity among African-American voters, including black elected officials, up to this point. The Congressional Black Caucus political action committee endorsed the former secretary of state on Thursday.Also on Thursday, Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), a civil rights hero who has endorsed Clinton, publicly questioned Sanders' civil rights movement bona fides.Meanwhile, Sanders picked up an endorsement this week from award-winning artist and civil rights movement veteran Harry Belafonte. And last week, former NAACP President Ben Jealous endorsed Sanders. Prominent author Ta-Nehisi Coates has also said that in spite of his vocal criticism of the democratic socialist, he plans to vote for Sanders.According to HuffPost Pollster's polling average, Sanders currently trails Clinton by 30 percentage points in South Carolina, where the primary is set for Feb. 27.CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article stated that cable networks had refused to air the Sanders campaign ad altogether.Also on HuffPost:"

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) as insufficiently supportive of the nation's first black president.In the debate, sponsored by PBS NewsHour and held in Milwaukee, Clinton seized upon Sanders' new interview with MSNBC, in which he said he didn't believe Obama has closed the ""gap"" that the American people feel with their government. ""This is not the first time he has criticized President Obama,"" Clinton said in the final and most tense exchange of the night. ""In the past, he's called him weak. He's called him a disappointment. He wrote a forward for a book that basically argued voters should have buyer's remorse when it comes to President Obama's leadership and legacy.""""The kind of criticism that we've heard from Sen. Sanders about our president, I expect from Republicans. I do not expect from someone running for the Democratic nomination to succeed President Obama,"" she added. Sanders called Clinton's accusations ""a low blow.""""I think it is really unfair to suggest that I have not been supportive of the president. I have been a strong ally of him on virtually every issue,"" he said, adding that senators are allowed to criticize the commander-in-chief in a democratic society.""One of us ran against Barack Obama. I was not that candidate,"" Sanders retorted. Sanders, indeed, did not run against Obama. But he did think about it -- or at least encouraged other progressives to think about it. ""I think one of the reasons the president has been able to move so far to the right is that there is no primary opposition to him and I think it would do this country a good deal of service if people started thinking about candidates out there to begin contrasting what is a progressive agenda as opposed to what Obama is doing,"" Sanders said in 2011. The book Clinton referenced, by liberal commentator Bill Press, is called Buyer's Remorse: How Obama Let Progressives Down.What Sanders wrote was more of a promotional blurb than a forward: ""Bill Press makes the case why, long after taking the oath of office, the next president of the United States must keep rallying the people who elected him or her on behalf of progressive causes. That is the only way real change will happen. Read this book.""Reached for comment by email, Press said the Clinton campaign must be ""desperate"" to keep bringing up the blurb, which it had previously done in a press release.""All Bernie says is that the next president must rally the American people to get Congress to act. He says that in every speech,"" Press said. ""My book is critical of President Obama's failure to deliver on several key progressive issues. Senator Sanders' blurb is not.""In preparation for South Carolina's Feb. 27 Democratic primary, Clinton has increasingly been highlighting her ties to Obama. Her first ad in the state featured Eric Holder, Obama's former attorney general and the first black man to hold that position. Holder argued that Clinton was the person best-positioned to carry on the president's legacy. And on Thursday, her campaign tweeted out a response to Sanders' MSNBC interview, making fun of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) in the same breath for his much-repeated line in the last debate. Obama has not endorsed in the Democratic presidential primary, although some believe he has dropped hints that he is backing Clinton. "

A man holding a Donald Trump sign and a woman holding a Bernie Sanders sign, their arms around one another, greeted New Hampshire voters as they entered the polling location. “We each have our own opinion, but we are friends,” Jim Bennett, 57, told a voter passing by who seemed to be confused at the sight of the pair standing together, engaged in pleasant conversation. “We’re like 'Ebony and Ivory,'” he explained with a smile. Sandra Paradis, 78, arrived to her polling location in the afternoon, with Bernie Sanders yard signs in hand. She said she wasn’t expecting to see a familiar face doing the exact same thing for the political outsider on the other side of the aisle.“I wasn’t expecting to see Mr. Bennett standing here,” Paradis said with a laugh. “Our families have known each other for a long time. Mr. Bennett is only a few years older than my son actually.”Bennett’s younger sister went to school with one of Paradis’ daughters, and told stories of how both girls were in the Manchester Memorial High School’s Homecoming court, where Bennett’s sister Gale was crowned the queen.“I have pictures of his sister at my house in our scrapbooks,” Paradis said, looking off into the distance. “The people in South and Southeast Manchester get along pretty well.”The two both seemed to be well-known in town, and voters approaching the school greeted both by name. Paradis served on the school board for 14 years, and Bennett recently retired from his career as a mail carrier.“We’re Manchester people,” Bennett said. “Sandy is kind of a local celebrity. Her brother is actually working on my pick-up truck.”The two voters acknowledged that both Trump and Sanders are tapping into the same anti-establishment anger and seem to be attracting the most passionate and enthusiastic supporters on the campaign trail this cycle. The friends admitted the dynamic between the two of them most likely does not reflect most Trump and Sanders supporters.“Whether we have differences or not, we can talk about them,” Paradis said. “We can do civil things together and work together.”Despite their friendship, they playfully mocked each other at times, doing imitations of each candidate and the way they say “huge turnout.” Paradis even tried on Bennett’s Trump beanie, and laughed as people walked past her looking puzzled.“Look at all these Bernie supporters here,” Paradis said with a smirk, looking over at Bennett.“They’re all here because he’s promising to give them all this free stuff,” Bennett shot back with a laugh.Paradis, who has been active in politics since the age of 25, says she identifies as an independent, although she is currently registered as a Democrat. At one point, she said, she was considering supporting Donald Trump.“My husband and I thought of changing our parties this year,” she explained. “We did like some of what Trump has said. We do need businesses. We need more businesses, especially in New Hampshire. Our manufacturing is all gone. I've been here a long time, 78 years. I've seen all the manufacturing go.”Paradis, who volunteered for Bill Clinton when he ran in 1992, says she couldn’t see herself supporting Hillary Clinton if she becomes the Democratic presidential nominee.“I wouldn’t vote for her. If Trump is nominated on the Republican side, I’d switch my political affiliation and vote for him,” Paradis explained. “I have voted for Republicans in the past, in the general election, I have definitely. I am purple; I am not red or blue.”Bennett does not feel the same way about Sanders. If Trump doesn’t become the Republican nominee, he said he would settle for one of the reality TV star’s rivals.“I would absolutely not support Bernie,” Bennett said. “I like Dr. Carson and Cruz. I would settle for one of them.”Paradis and Bennett didn’t know at the time that the candidates they were supporting would surge to commanding victories in the New Hampshire primary and draw massive turnout across the state.As the race for the White House heats up, the business mogul turned Republican presidential candidate and the Democratic socialist have recently taken aim at one another, both candidates acknowledging that they could be competing in the general election.Bennett said his community doesn’t participate in the mudslinging. He said the majority of voters passing by were very polite.“People go by and I just say, 'Thank you for voting,'” Bennett explained. “Some say, you know Trump is our man. Other people will say ... thanks for being there, but we're not voting for your guy. That's cool, I'm just glad they're here voting.”Paradis agrees. She said she’ll leave the attacks and the insults to the politicians.“Whether we have differences, with our political views or whatever, we try to help each other out,” she said. “We always have. If you're neighbors, you try to help your neighbor. You just don't ignore them.”"
11,POLITICS,Why Hillary Clinton's Argument For Keeping Children From Coming To The U.S. Doesn't Work,Cristian Farias and Elise Foley,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-plan-migrant-children_us_56be15b5e4b0c3c5505109cd,"The courts have found that ""deterrence"" is not a valid policy justification.",2016-02-12,Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton don't exactly see eye to eye on how to deal with migrant children fleeing Central America.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56be16171f00000d01217eb6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"During a spat with presidential rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) over what to do with thousands of migrant children fleeing Central America, Hillary Clinton said on Thursday it was important to make it loud and clear why they shouldn’t bother coming.“I made it very clear that those children needed to be processed appropriately,"" Clinton said at the PBS Newshour Democratic debate. ""But we also had to send a message to families and communities in Central America not to send their children on this dangerous journey in the hands of smugglers.”The courts have found the blanket policy of “sending a message,” however, constitutionally deficient. The term is government-speak for general deterrence -- using detention, deportation and other practices against children and families with the goal of dissuading other children and families from fleeing their countries and coming to the U.S. In February last year, a federal judge in Washington frowned on the practice and ordered Immigration and Customs Enforcement to stop relying on deterrence in the detention of mothers and children with a “credible fear” of violence and persecution in their homelands. The government’s “policy of considering deterrence has profound and immediate consequences for Central American asylum seekers detained as a result,” the court said in its decision. The move forced ICE to abandon the practice in May -- at least with respect to children and families seeking refuge in the U.S. In another case out of California, a federal judge chastised the Department of Homeland Security last July for relying on deterrence as a detention rationale, calling it “lacking in scientific rigor.”It's also not as simple as just ""sending back"" unaccompanied minors to Central America. Children traveling without their parents from countries other than Mexico or Canada go through a different process for removal, one that has a longer court process. Adults and minors determined to have a credible fear of returning to their home countries are given a chance under asylum law to argue for relief, which also results in longer periods in the U.S.""It is not illegal to come to the border of the United States of America and to ask for political asylum in the United States, to ask for refugee status in the United States,"" Rep. Luis Gutierrez (D-Ill.) said at a House committee hearing last week. ""That is not illegal. That is a law and a statute of the United States of America.""The administration has acknowledged poor conditions in Central America and is working to improve them, and Congress allocated $750 million for that effort last year. To discourage people from coming to the United States without authorization, the government funds public service announcements in the countries to warn people about the dangers of the journey. The U.S. will also expand its refugee screening program in Central America as well, officials announced last month.In the meantime, numbers of unaccompanied minors and families apprehended at the border climbed in the final months of last year, although they dipped in January. The administration ramped up enforcement efforts at the same time through much-criticized raids on families.Both Sanders and Clinton said they disapproved of the raids, and generally have attempted to go further than President Barack Obama on immigration. But the dispute over dealing with unaccompanied children is a point where the former Secretary of State has run into criticism before.In 2014, at the height of the surge in apprehensions of minors, she said many of the minors ""should be sent back"" to their native countries, adding that she supported efforts to improve the situation in Central America so they wouldn't feel they had to leave. Last year she said her position was unchanged, although her larger focus would be getting women and children out of detention.The Sanders campaign clearly thinks the attack is an advantageous one -- they're already going after her for it.“Secretary Clinton is wrong,"" Sanders' Latino outreach director, Arturo Carmona, said in a statement. ""We should never put children back into harm's way to 'send a message' to anyone."""

Rick Snyder (R) has asked to testify before members of Congress about the Flint water crisis. Democrats were furious that House Oversight Committee chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah) hadn't called Snyder to testify at an earlier hearing on Flint, where the water has been poisoned by high lead levels since 2014. Snyder's office said in a release that he called Chaffetz Thursday and offered to make the trip.""The people of Flint have suffered because they were failed by all levels of government, and so it is understandable that there are questions at all levels of government,"" Snyder said in the release. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), the top Democrat on the oversight committee, disputed Snyder's characterization of his decision to testify. ""Contrary to Governor Snyder’s recent claim that he requested this ‘opportunity to testify,’ the reality is that he is finally bowing to mounting public pressure to answer questions before Congress about the central and critical role his administration played in this man-made disaster,"" Cummings said in a statement. Snyder has repeatedly apologized for the crisis, but he and the PR firms he's hired have also emphasized the federal government's role. A top Environmental Protection Agency official announced her resignation last month after having downplayed lead concerns last year. State officials failed to ensure Flint's water received anti-corrosion treatment when the city of 100,000 switched its water source in 2014. The new water dissolved lead from the city's pipes, which found its way into Flint kids' blood. Lead is a deadly neurotoxin that can leave children with permanent brain damage after being ingested.Lead fears came to public attention last year, but Snyder's government dismissed them until a pediatrician documented Flint children's higher blood lead levels last fall. All along, Flint residents had been complaining that their water looked and tasted foul. Democrats have been hammering Snyder for not responding more quickly to Flint's water woes, alleging environmental racism since Flint has a majority African-American population. Snyder declined Democrats' invitation to testify at a different hearing this week, but apparently the governor is now ready to face their criticism. ""In Michigan we are learning a great deal from this crisis and I am hopeful the federal government also will use this as an opportunity to examine health and safety protections in place, assess infrastructure needs, and avoid this type of crisis in the future,"" Snyder said. This story has been updated to include comment from Cummings."

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7e4ec1d00003000143032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- If you want to understand the real meaning of Thursday night's debate between Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders -- or the increasingly ugly feud between their supporters -- you have to go back to President Barack Obama's election in 2008.Obama's triumph brought together every wing of the Democratic Party and inspired a generation of young voters: idealists who wanted a complete break from the Bush years, centrists who were angry about the Iraq War, radicals who wanted to reshape the financial system, bankers who concluded Obama would get the economy back on track, and many, many more. Each faction projected its own worldview onto Obama, believing he would pursue their own particular vision of the future.That was impossible. And so, committed Democrats have been fighting about Obama ever since he entered office. The meaning of his presidency and what it could have been are not simply topics of academic debate -- they cut right to the emotional core of why many people got involved in Democratic Party politics, and why they identify as Democrats at all.Obama will probably be remembered by historians as a liberal champion. In the face of a hardline conservative opposition fueled by often-transparent racism, he expanded access to health care, implemented Wall Street reforms and rescued the economy from almost total collapse. It is this vision of Obama that Clinton is tying her own image to, attempting to present Sanders as a traitor to the cause.But if Obama is remembered as a consummate progressive, it will be because he delivered corporate America's final conquest over the Democratic Party, and in doing so, enabled future historians to erase the party's anti-corporate wing from the narrative.Obama began his presidency by essentially telling movement progressives to shut up and quit making trouble for his corporate-friendly agenda. Former Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs derided and insulted ""the professional left"" in press conferences. When liberal organizations advocated for a public option during Obamacare talks, former White House Chief Of Staff Rahm Emanuel pressured them to stop by threatening their funding sources. Obama economic adviser Christina Romer was sidelined after demonstrating that the economic stimulus package needed to be much larger than what National Economic Council Chair Larry Summers would accept. Obama has deported more people than any other president -- nearly 25 percent more than even President George W. Bush. He supported Medicare and Social Security cuts for years. While it's true that he faced scorched-earth opposition from Republicans, it was Obama who pressed for an entitlement-slashing ""Grand Bargain"" during the nearly catastrophic debt ceiling talks of 2011. This maneuvering on critical support for the elderly is what prompted Sanders in 2011 to advocate for a primary challenger to Obama -- a comment Clinton is now wielding against him as evidence of supposed liberal apostasy.""I think there are millions of Americans who are deeply disappointed in the president, who believe that, with regard to Social Security and a number of other issues, he said one thing as a candidate and is doing something very much else as a president,"" Sanders said in 2011. At the time, Sanders didn't come out and say Obama should be replaced -- only that the prospect of another candidate could hold his feet to the fire. At first, that's how many political experts viewed Sanders' challenge to Clinton. When she publicly opposed Obama's Trans-Pacific Partnership trade pact -- one of the biggest foreign policy goals of his administration -- it was a clear victory for the liberal wing of the party. Corporate executives love TPP; labor unions do not.But then Sanders kept campaigning. He raised huge amounts of money from small donors and won a massive victory in the New Hampshire primary. Clinton maintains a wide lead over Sanders among black voters, and her debate performance Thursday night included an unsubtle effort to maintain that margin by hailing Obama's achievements.After several skirmishes, Sanders eventually dismissed Clinton's charges about his stance on Obama by pointing out that she had not always looked so fondly on the current president herself.""One of us ran against Barack Obama,"" Sanders said, invoking the 2008 race. ""I was not that candidate."" Listen to HuffPost's analysis of Thursday's debate in the podcast embedded above. Subscribe here.Now that the South Carolina primary is looming on the calendar, Sanders could have referenced the Clintons' embarrassing, race-baiting tactics from eight years ago. He didn't. And because Sanders is uncomfortable on foreign policy, he also largely ignored a very well-documented dark side to the Obama years that many early Obama enthusiasts have since criticized. Former Attorney General Eric Holder publicly argued for the extrajudicial assassination of American citizens. A few weeks after Obama announced that the war in Afghanistan would not end on his watch, U.S. forces bombed a Doctors Without Borders hospital in Kunduz. Obama has a kill list. But Sanders was less shy about Wall Street. Voters, Clinton suggested, don't have to worry that big banks can influence politicians like herself with huge campaign contributions. After all, she argued, Obama got a lot of money from the financial industry, and he still signed the Dodd-Frank Act. Sanders wasn't impressed.""No Wall Street executive has been prosecuted,"" he noted.And it is indeed on Wall Street where Obama's liberal bona fides are weakest. Obama hasn't even bothered to spend tens of billions of dollars that Congress allotted to him for foreclosure relief. His refusal to tackle the housing problem made the Great Recession longer and more severe. Holder failed to prosecute the widespread fraud at the heart of the 2008 collapse -- or even to pursue the myriad infractions that regulators revealed in subsequent activity. When she was a federal prosecutor, Loretta Lynch didn't bring a single case -- not even a fine -- against any HSBC employee after she forced the firm to settle for allegedly laundering billions of dollars drug money. She ignored clear evidence of what proved to be a massive tax evasion scandal at the company in the process. Obama still named her Holder's successor.People forget that Obama hired Bill Daley, a former JPMorgan Chase vice president who had lobbied the White House against creating the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, to serve as his chief of staff. The agency, which was the brainchild of Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), ultimately survived Daley's entreaties, but he was a bank-friendly voice in Obama's ear for much of his first term. Daley now works for a Swiss hedge fund, and other top Obama advisers have a tendency to land jobs with decidedly illiberal corporations. Gibbs is now the top flack for McDonald's. His successor, Jay Carney, now smears New York Times reporters on behalf of Amazon. Peter Orszag, Obama's former Office of Management and Budget director, decamped to Citigroup and began writing op-eds defending the Bush tax cuts for the rich. Summers left to work for Citi and the hedge fund D.E. Shaw & Co. Obama adviser David Plouffe took a job at Uber a few months before its senior vice president boasted about a plan to spend ""a million dollars"" digging up personal dirt on journalists who criticized the company. Former Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner is now a private equity kingpin. Emanuel didn't return to investment banking after leaving the White House, but his disgraceful handling of the Laquan McDonald police shooting in Chicago has made him a political pariah. None of this means that Obama has been a bad president. But it has long been clear which faction won out among Obama's early supporters: the corporate faction. For many Obama enthusiasts, this can be overlooked. The Affordable Care Act made imperfect deals with insurance companies and pharmaceutical firms, but it did ultimately expand health care access. Obama went easy on banks, but he did pass some good new regulations. The overwhelming majority of economic gains under Obama have gone to the top 1 percent, but at least the unemployment rate is back under control.When Clinton challenges Sanders on the Obama legacy, she is, of course, making an identity politics play for black voters. But she's also making an implicit argument about the centrality of corporate elites and corporate favors to the very idea of progressive politics. Sanders' entire campaign is built on the rejection of that idea. And Democrats haven't decided which vision they prefer. Also on HuffPost:"

Donna Lichtenegger (R-Jackson) cited student activism as the reason to pass a budget amendment that would exclude Mizzou from any increase in state support for higher education next year, according to local media reports. ""They are there to learn, not to protest all day long. I thought we learned that lesson in the '60s. Obviously we haven't,"" she said.Lichtenegger, who chairs the House Committee for Higher Education Appropriations, had proposed the amendment. Her office told HuffPost that she was not available to comment on the budget this week.Students protested at the University of Missouri in November over the administration's response to multiple incidents of racism on and near campus, over a confrontation between activists and then-President Tim Wolfe, and over decisions to scrap health insurance for graduate students and cut ties to Planned Parenthood. ""It seems to me that the legislature is trying to retaliate against the university for the events that happened last fall,"" said junior Polly Haun, a student government senator at Mizzou. She worried that if her school doesn't receive the budget increases being considered for other state-funded Missouri colleges and universities, there will be tuition increases.""Students should feel free to express themselves about important issues on campus without the threat of rising tuition costs, and the university should be able to operate independently of the legislature,"" Haun said. At Wednesday's committee hearing, Lichtenegger suggested that Mizzou's board of curators, the university's governing body, should do more to prevent students from protesting. ""It would be one thing if it just made state news, but this is national,"" she said.

Donna Lichtenegger (R-Jackson) cited student activism as the reason to pass a budget amendment that would exclude Mizzou from any increase in state support for higher education next year, according to local media reports. ""They are there to learn, not to protest all day long. I thought we learned that lesson in the '60s. Obviously we haven't,"" she said.Lichtenegger, who chairs the House Committee for Higher Education Appropriations, had proposed the amendment. Her office told HuffPost that she was not available to comment on the budget this week.Students protested at the University of Missouri in November over the administration's response to multiple incidents of racism on and near campus, over a confrontation between activists and then-President Tim Wolfe, and over decisions to scrap health insurance for graduate students and cut ties to Planned Parenthood. ""It seems to me that the legislature is trying to retaliate against the university for the events that happened last fall,"" said junior Polly Haun, a student government senator at Mizzou. She worried that if her school doesn't receive the budget increases being considered for other state-funded Missouri colleges and universities, there will be tuition increases.""Students should feel free to express themselves about important issues on campus without the threat of rising tuition costs, and the university should be able to operate independently of the legislature,"" Haun said. At Wednesday's committee hearing, Lichtenegger suggested that Mizzou's board of curators, the university's governing body, should do more to prevent students from protesting. ""It would be one thing if it just made state news, but this is national,"" she said.

More than 772 lb. of explosives had been recovered from a building believed to be a hideout, he said.The attackers planned to raid the prison compound with two vans filled with explosives, and had a list of about 35 prisoners they planned to kill, Bajwa said, displaying pencil sketches of the prison allegedly made by the militants.They had a separate list of about 100 prisoners, including Sheikh, whom they were supposed to release, he added.Video images of the militants' hideout showed blue plastic barrels filled with explosives, washing machines that had been used to transport arms and ammunition, long lengths of detonating cord and dozens of ball bearings.The footage also showed several rifles that Bajwa said had been stolen from police in earlier targeted attacks.""This plan was 90 percent ready for execution,"" he added."

Some 16,000 children in South Sudan have been forced to the front lines since December 2013, when conflict broke out in the world's newest country, according to UNICEF.On Friday, as the world marks the International Day Against the Use of Child Soldiers, The WorldPost asked Whitaker about his work with these children and other young victims of conflict.Read Forest Whitaker's blog about his experiences with child soldiers here. What sparked your interest in stopping recruitment of child soldiers around the world?I first became really passionate about this issue a little over 10 years ago when I was in Uganda shooting ""The Last King of Scotland"". One day on set, one of the performers -- a dancer and a musician named Okello Sam -- asked me if I would come with him to a school he had built called Hope North. This place was a home and a sanctuary for former child soldiers and orphans of Uganda’s civil war, which was ending around this time. As a father, I was horrified to hear the stories of what these children had to endure. But I was also moved beyond words to see their resilience and witness what Sam and his team at Hope North were doing to help make them whole again. I knew that I wanted to do my part to help these children and other boys and girls whose lives are impacted by violence.I became very involved with Hope North and I’ve been back many times over the years. When I told my daughters about these children, they wanted to help, and they donated their laptops to the school. About four years ago, inspired by Sam’s work at Hope North, I launched my own foundation, the Whitaker Peace & Development Initiative, which works to empower young women and men impacted by conflict to rise above these challenges and become leaders and community builders.Did meeting former child soldiers influence your understanding of the problem of their recruitment and potential solutions?One of the things I quickly came to understand after meeting former child soldiers was the importance of the work being done at Hope North to educate and rehabilitate these young people. When we talk about the issue of child soldiers, it can be easy to focus just on ending recruitment and liberating those boys and girls who are currently being held in military camps. Obviously, both of these are incredibly important goals, but it’s also essential that we not forget about former child soldiers once they are liberated. These children have all suffered truly unimaginable traumas. In some sense, when you take a child soldier out of an armed group, you’ve taken away the identity he or she has had for years, and you can’t assume life is just going to return to normal. Many of them were forced to commit acts of violence against family members or would be ostracized from their communities if they tried to go back. It can be a very difficult and lengthy process, but it’s so important that we are there for these children to help them find their true identities and rediscover that feeling of being part of a community. Rehabilitation programs have to play an important role in this solution.The Whitaker Peace & Development Initiative trains youth, including ex-child soldiers, in Uganda and South Sudan in conflict resolution and other life skills. Why are rehabilitation programs like this so important to the future peace in those countries?These rehabilitation and peace education programs for former child soldiers and other young people impacted by violence are some of the most effective forms of preventative peacekeeping that exist. For many child soldiers, war and violence are all they have ever known. If we don’t take it upon ourselves to show them an alternative, then they’re going to be soldiers forever, and they’ll continue to be recruited and to participate in violence if another conflict starts five or 10 years down the road. This is a cycle that has the potential to repeat their whole lives. By intervening with rehabilitation and education programs, we can break these cycles. This makes a huge difference not only in the lives of these former child soldiers, but also in the societies around them. With these programs, we can help turn soldiers into teachers, doctors, and leaders.There was one former child soldier we worked with at Hope North named Simon. When I first met him, he was a shell of his previous self. There was this emptiness in his eyes. But over time, as he went through our program and became part of a community again, you could see a transformation occur. The light is back in his eyes, and he’s started his own business -- an electronics store that he’s opened with some other students from Hope North. He’s reaching out to other youth whose lives have been impacted by conflict, and he’s becoming a role model in his community. This is an outcome that’s possible for former child soldiers. We need to work to make these stories more common.The initiative has peace-building projects in Mexico and the U.S. What parallels have you found between children living in violence-afflicted areas in the U.S. and Africa?One of the reasons I became so involved in this cause was that, when I first started working with child soldiers 10 years ago, I couldn’t help but notice the similarities between them and a lot of the kids I knew growing up in South Los Angeles. I was in middle school right around the time the Bloods and the Crips started taking root in Compton and a lot of the other neighborhoods around me. I saw way too many of my peers -- smart, kind, good kids -- who got drawn into gangs and violence, and their futures were going to be forever scarred by that.I think this is a common feature wherever there is conflict, whether in East Africa, Mexico, or right here in the United States: when young people feel like they don’t have any real pathways to a successful livelihood and future, that’s when they turn to violence. Building peace requires that we resolve the underlying root causes of conflict, and in almost all cases, that means working in communities to develop real opportunities for youths to learn, work, and succeed.What results have you seen from your wellness programs, such as yoga and meditation, for violence-affected children in Africa and North America?The yoga, meditation, and life-skills components that you mentioned are really important in the work that WPDI does. The model that we follow for many of our programs is to work with a core group of young women and men in vulnerable communities and develop their skills as leaders and conflict mediators. Then we support these youths as they go back to their homes and start their own peace-building initiatives and recruit other young people to join them. As you alluded to, many of our participants have been victims of violence -- some are former child soldiers, some have been displaced by conflict, some have lost family members. It’s very difficult to build outer-peace in the world around you if you are struggling to find your own inner-peace. We want to help our youth peacemakers overcome the traumas and hardships they’ve faced. Teaching them yoga and meditation techniques and helping them live balanced, healthy lives is really important in enabling them to go out and create change in their communities.So far, our youths have responded really positively to these wellness aspects of our program. There was one former child soldier we work with -- who is now in his mid-20s -- who told me that, before he learned to meditate, the only way he could calm his nerves was with alcohol. Some of our peacemakers have started practicing yoga every day to find a sense of calm and stability. For people who have endured some terrible hardships, these things can make a real difference in how they perceive themselves and relate to the world.Which achievements of the U.N. campaign Children, Not Soldiers -- launched in 2014 and aimed to end and prevent nations' use of child soldiers by 2016 -- that you advocated for have been most encouraging?The Children, Not Soldier campaign is currently working with governments in seven countries that have historically recruited child soldiers. What we’ve seen over the past two years is that, for the first time, some of these nations are showing a true willingness to reform and protect children. Of these seven countries, six have signed action plans with the United Nations. I think the fact that Children, Not Soldiers has been able to make the seriousness of this problem known -- especially to leaders in countries that have been among the worst violators -- is an important achievement in and of itself.We are also seeing more than just commitments to change, but also tangible reforms as well. For example, a few years ago, Chad worked with the United Nations to create an action plan for ending the recruitment and use of child soldiers. Recently, it completed every step on that plan, and Chad has now been removed from the Secretary-General’s list of parties that use child soldiers. This shows that real progress and meaningful reform are possible.Despite Yemen and South Sudan's commitments to end child recruitment, the ongoing wars in those countries appear to have set back progress, with more children on the battle lines. What has been your biggest disappointment of the campaign?The lack of progress in recent months in South Sudan is an enormous disappointment and an international tragedy. My foundation has been involved in South Sudan since 2012, and it’s been heartbreaking to see the conditions that so many children in that nation have had to endure. In 2014, during one of my trips to South Sudan, I and Leila Zerrougui, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General for Children and Armed Conflict, met with President [Salva] Kiir, who had committed to work with the United Nations to end the use of child soldiers in South Sudan’s army. As part of the peace agreement signed last August between the government and rebel forces, both sides reaffirmed this commitment. The fact that both parties have been violating the ceasefire agreement and continuing to recruit and use child soldiers is unacceptable. I continue to join the international community in calling on South Sudan’s leaders to honor the ceasefire and protect all children impacted by this conflict.How can ordinary people contribute to the campaign to end child recruitment in conflict?First of all, anyone who wants to learn more about Children, Not Soldiers can visit their website. I also think one of the powerful things about social media is that it gives people a megaphone to come together and advocate for the causes they care about. If you look throughout history, every significant social movement has had thousands or millions of ordinary people behind it, standing up for what is right. So if you want to help raise awareness of this campaign and show your support, tell your friends and followers about it and use the hashtag #ChildrenNotSoldiers.If you can afford it and want to help WPDI empower children and youths in regions of the world impacted by violence, we would be grateful for your donation.Finally, something everyone can do is to take a moment right now and don’t think of child soldiers as just statistics on a piece of paper or a problem that affects some far-away country. Imagine that your children were taken from you and forced to live in military camps and commit unspeakable acts of violence. Imagine you spent your childhood with a gun in your hands fighting a war, instead of going to school and playing with your friends. That scenario is a reality for hundreds of thousands of children and families throughout the world. I hope you’ll join me in showing your support for these children and telling leaders around the world that we won’t stand for it.Also on HuffPost:"

Though Clinton has done several network TV interviews and participated in debates over the past couple months, the lack of accessibility on the campaign trail has been a source of frustration among reporters. Reporters covering Clinton in the run-up to voting in Iowa and New Hampshire frequently discussed the issue, and likely will continue to as the candidate heads to Nevada and South Carolina. A Clinton spokesman had no immediate comment. Reporters who've followed Clinton for months may have little to no relationship with the candidate. And the only opportunity they have to ask her questions is when she works the rope line after events, a time when candidates typically shake hands and pose for selfies with supporters.Given the lack of access, reporters and camera crews routinely rush toward the candidate after she steps off stage, even barreling through supporters in attempts to pose questions that are likely to be ignored.Clinton has never been as chummy as some candidates with her traveling press corps, and she had little interaction with campaign reporters for long stretches during the 2008 race, too. Politico's Glenn Thrush recalled Clinton boarding the press bus ""for the very first time"" on the eve of the 2008 Iowa caucuses with a bag of bagels. ""The candidate was smiling, but her eyes said something different -- and so did her feet, which never budged past the white line that separates bus driver from passenger,"" Thrush wrote. ""It is the only time I can ever recall a group of reporters happy to see a major newsmaker depart.”The Clinton campaign got off to a rocky start with the press this election cycle, with reporters raising concerns last spring over access and staffers corralling journalists at a July 4 parade.There hasn't been any similar corralling lately, and in fact, the Clinton campaign is far less hostile to reporters than Donald Trump's campaign, which has consistently penned in the press at rallies and uses Secret Service agents to help enforce its restrictions on journalists' movements.UPDATE: 7:30 p.m. -- Politico's Anne Karni reported Thursday night that Clinton will have a closed-door meeting Tuesday with Rev. Al Shaprton in New York that will be followed by a press conference, the first in more than two months."
