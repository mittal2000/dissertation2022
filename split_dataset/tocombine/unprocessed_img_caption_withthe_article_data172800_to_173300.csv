In an effort to combat obesity, the New York City Board of Health voted to ban the sale of large sugary drinks. The controversial measure bars the sale of sugar drinks larger than 16 ounces at restaurants and concessions.

Earlier this year, a study in the Journal of General Internal Medicine showed a link between drinking a diet soda every day and higher stroke and heart attack risk. ""It makes sense, if [sugar sweetened beverages] increase the risk for obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance, inflammation, then it should, in fact, raise the risk for cardiovascular disease, and that's what we're seeing,"" Cleveland Clinic's Adam Bernstein, who was not involved in the study, told Reuters.The study included 39,786 men and women in Japan between the ages of 40 and 59, who were tracked between 1990 and 2008. They filled out a questionnaire asking them about their soft drink consumption.By the end of the study period, 453 people had ischemic heart disease and 1,922 people had had a stroke (1,047 of which were ischemic, the other 859 were hemorrhagic). Researchers found that women who had drank the most soda in the study -- Reuters reported that this was nearly a soda a day -- had a higher risk of ischemic stroke than those who drank the least soda in the study. However, researchers didn't find a risk between soda consumption and ischemic heart disease, or hemorrhagic stroke for either men or women. A previous study from Harvard researchers did find a link between sugary drink consumption and increased coronary heart disease risk, at least for men, ABC News reported.In that study, which included 43,000 people who were part of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study, coronary heart disease risk was found to be 20 percent higher for the men who drank a daily sugary drink, compared with those who didn't drink any sugary drinks, according to ABC News. The findings are important because we as Americans drink a lot of sugary drinks, and it's necessary to know what the potential ramifications are. After all, a recent Gallup study showed that nearly half of Americans drink a soda every single day. For more potential health effects of soda, click through the slideshow:"

Despite promises that gas supplies would rebound and long lines at the pump would dissipate, the gas shortage plaguing New York and New Jersey has caused some people to take matters into their own hands, buying and selling gas online via Craigslist for up to $30 a gallon. One person claiming to be ""an upstate New York contractor"" posted Sunday that he would be delivering gas to Brooklyn, N.Y., selling 5-gallon containers for $150 (h/t Business Insider).An ad placed in New York promised speedy delivery of 87 octane gas for $20 a gallon -- “NO water in it!!!”, the ad proclaimed. Another person in New Jersey was selling 5-gallon cans for $45 a piece. The current average price of gas per gallon is $3.470, according to AAA. Tension is running high due to the gas shortage. In Queens, N.Y. a man was arrested for allegedly pointing a gun at another motorist in line at a gas station. In New Jersey on Sunday, gas station lines were as long as half a mile. Many frustrated New Yorkers have taken to Twitter to voice their outrage: Gasoline isn’t the only black market to emerge after the storm. After Sandy hit, street stands in lower Manhattan were selling hurricane necessities  well above market price, with small flashlights selling for around $10 and candles were going for $4. For those who want to stick to more traditional ways of getting gas, crowdsourcing online could be one of the best ways to figure out where gas is available. Twitter accounts such as @brooklyngas and @njgas have been created to help provide information on where to find gas.Here's a round-up of some of the insane price gouging we've seen online: "

Osbourne has survived cancer before, as she was diagnosed with colon cancer 10 years ago, the Associated Press reported. While Osbourne didn't reveal which breast cancer gene she has, it's well-known that certain harmful mutations of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes raise the risk of breast and ovarian cancers. These genes ordinarily work as tumor suppressors, but when they are mutated, they are known to lead to a dramatically raised risk of cancer, the National Cancer Institute reported.While having the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene raises risk of breast cancer, it's not a guarantee a woman will get it, CNN reported.""Patients with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations have 50 percent - 85 percent lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and up to approximately 60 percent lifetime risk of ovarian cancer,"" Karen Brown, the director of the Cancer Genetic Counseling Program at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, told CNN. A person can find if he or she has the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes by undergoing DNA analysis, though the Mayo Clinic noted that only people who have a family history or who have a certain breast cancer type are eligible to receive this test. Around 5 percent of breast cancer cases are attributed to having inherited the BRCA gene mutation, as are 10 to 15 percent of cases of ovarian cancer, according to the Mayo Clinic. Osbourne's surgery, called a double mastectomy, involves removal of both breasts. "

There's nothing worse than a wedding party that turns into a pity party.Those who attend a wedding are there to celebrate the love of two people they at least like (if not love), and the atmosphere couldn't be better for having fun. Add in the fact that everyone in attendance is a friend of either the groom or bride and you have yourself a built-in background check, conveniently eliminating the imminent Facebook stalk or questioning whether or not the man you want to go to dinner with is potentially a player, gold digger or worse.I remember a wedding a client attended last fall where everyone was practically jumping for joy post-ceremony. Good food, champagne flowing and people in the mood for love creates an ideal situation for finding love. In fact, at this particular wedding my client incidentally got asked out by not one but two guys, and I'll tell you how.1. Do NOT bring a plus one.   First and foremost, unless you're in an exclusive relationship, make sure to head to the wedding solo. Yes, we know you're thinking ""How single will I look if I go to the wedding alone?!"" The answer? As single as you should look if you want to find love at a wedding this fall! As tempting as it is to bring that guy whom you kind of like but have been on only three dates with...trust me: leave him at home. As the saying goes, do not bring sand to the beach!2. Be positive! It can be depressing getting invited to yet another friend's joyful union of love while you're still single, but it's very important to remember that happiness is in fact a choice. So remind yourself that you are, in fact, in the presence of the blessing of a wedding reception (and that guy at the table next to you as well!). Don't use the wedding as a reminder of your singledom but instead as a launchpad into your next date or relationship. And finally, make sure not to drown any possible sorrows in the free-flowing champagne. Staying dignified is paramount to having a positively good time!3. Yes, sit at the singles table! Don't avoid the singles table; getting trapped at a table with couples could be your biggest mistake of the wedding season. You're essentially guaranteed to meet SOMEONE who's at the very least single. (And at the very most someone you really enjoy!) It's not as if you're the only person at the table.Take the opportunity at dinner to feel out your suitors. Are their conversation skills up to par? Is one dribbling chicken all over his lap? Don't judge too harshly, because they're probably nervous too. But do try to enjoy the meal and be your charming self. You might end up meeting a fabulous new female friend who can be your wing girl for the night, or at least someone with whom you can chat with as you reapply your makeup in the powder room.4. Get introduced by a mutual friend. There is literally nothing better than getting introduced to an eligible guy by a friend whom you both know. Getting the thumbs up from a member of the wedding party or a guest equals a much easier path to dating than a blind date at a coffee shop or an online date.Remind the bride and groom before the wedding to keep their eyes out for you if they think any of their male guests could be your match. This will certainly give you the advantage over the other single gal guests!If you want to find love at a wedding this fall, adhere to these tips. And most of all, don't forget to have fun!"

Days after the worst storm in my lifetime devastated huge sections of the New Jersey coast as well as local communities along various rivers, I have the luxury of sitting in my generator-powered living room, writing. My family is safe and warm, and our house is undamaged. My kids are getting a little antsy being homebound and annoyed that Halloween was canceled for the second year in a row, and my wife (a psychologist) and I are frustrated, unable to open our offices due to lack of heat and electricity. These are relatively small problems in the scheme of what could have been and what is for others. Understand, I was born and raised in New Jersey, and I have lived my entire life here with the exception of college and medical school. N.J. is not just where I live; it is a part of who I am, as much as it is for the families I care for in my pediatric practice. I am deeply embedded, consciously, within my community. And now, I am feeling its pain, and I'm struggling to find a way to help my patients. I first thought I could write to create awareness about some big issue like the real life impact of climate change, but I can't yet wrap my mind around it. It seems so indirect and disconnected right now. So I put out a call through my Whole Child Facebook page, our virtual community, for stories. Here's what I posted:I know that we are trying hard to cope -- and help our children cope -- with the aftermath of probably the worst local environmental disaster in many of our lifetimes. I am wondering -- what are YOU telling your kids and doing to help them cope? I am trying today to focus, which is very hard, to create something constructive by writing about our experiences. Please help me out with your stories.And so they did. I thought I would share some of our messages with you. I've edited a little bit for space constraints and to remove names but did not alter the content. We have spent the last few days taking the opportunity to sort through our clothes and toys and put together an assortment of things to be donated. It has been something we have been meaning to do. After telling the girls about all the little boys and girls who lost everything, it has made it easier for them to give things away. The pictures of people's homes and the devastation have only inspired them more. I would never have thought at such a young age, how empathetic and compassionate kids could be.I am so moved by the resilience of our children and the diversity of suggestions. Maybe one of these messages will help you and your children cope a bit more easily.

School trips can be a sort of initiation trip for teenagers, where they are introduced for the first time to alcohol and drugs. Many times they don't sleep for the whole trip. The trips often allow the students to get to know each other better. If one is considered 'different' than the group, it can be a nightmare experience for the teenager. Mainly the teenagers are only interested in clubs, shopping and having a pizza instead of the cultural aspects of the school trip.

For nearly 20 years I battled what was probably an anxiety disorder disguised as perfectionism, so I know what a happiness-killer anxiety is, so I rarely write posts that will make parents more anxious about their children or parenting. But, I am worried about my children and their friends. It would be irresponsible of me to tell you that our kids are alright. Many are not.I've just returned from a board meeting at a highly selective prep school that is fending off the ""specialization ethos"" that dominates the culture of higher education -- the notion, created by the astoundingly competitive college selection process, that kids should not necessarily be well-rounded, but that they should have specialized, honed and unique talents by the time they reach puberty. It isn't enough to be a varsity soccer player or elite cellist anymore; kids need to be the best striker in town or to have played at Carnegie Hall.Pressuring our children to specialize young, to achieve, to compete with more and more kids for few spots at elite colleges is soul-crushing for them. It destroys the peer culture so important to teens; it ingrains cliques; it heightens their stress. Consider:-Kids are increasingly self-medicating to deal with the pressure. The Monitoring the Future survey of U.S. secondary school students found that forty percent of high-school students reported using a drug or drugs in the past 12 months. The 2011 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found 31% of kids between the ages of 18 and 21 reported ""binge drinking"" -- having five or more drinks on one occasion -- in the last month.-Thirteen to 24 percent of high school students cut or injure themselves deliberately. Self-injury is a distressingly common way for kids to express emotional pain and relieve stress and anxiety.-According to ANAD, a quarter of college-age women binge and purge to ""control their weight"" (binge eating and then vomiting is a sign of the eating disorder bulimia). Anorexia is the third most common chronic illness among adolescents and eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness.-A nationwide survey of college students at two- and four-year institutions found that nearly 30 percent of college students felt ""so depressed that it was difficult to function"" at some time in the past year."" About 10 percent of college students have thought seriously about committing suicide or have made a plan to do so.When we pressure children to achieve, we cut them off from their sources of inspiration, their passions and their natural curiosity. They don't grow up to love learning but instead are schooled in how to game tests and make the grade. This does not make their lives meaningful, or happy.College-bound kids graduate from high-school knowing very well what is expected of them by others. They know that dad wants them to play lacrosse and mom wants them to be a lawyer, but they don't actually know who they are, or what they want for themselves. Here is my advice for raising kids who don't fall into the large minority of kids that is really struggling: Don't just worry, do something. Focus on building skills for happiness, resilience and character (that is what this whole blog, and my entire career, is dedicated to). If you have teenagers, develop an understanding of what teens really need to lead meaningful and happy lives (this will be the subject of my next post). Finally, redefine success as more than achievement. Think about fostering real mastery in areas where your kids indicate interests (read about the growth mindset, for example). Teach your children what really leads to happiness and fulfillment in life, and parent toward that.Do you worry about your kids developing depression, an anxiety or eating disorder or self-harming? Why do you worry? If you don't worry, why don't you?© 2012 Christine Carter, Ph.D. Like this post?

The idea for the Million Puppet March, as it was called, was born after Mitt Romney spoke of his plans to end government funding for PBS.""I like PBS. I love Big Bird... But I am not going to keep spending money on things [we have] to borrow money from China to pay for,"" Romney famously said during the first presidential debate.And so, on Saturday, November 3rd, adults dressed in ""Sesame Street"" costumes, toddlers rallied and according to the Washington Post, a puppet-themed wedding even took place. The mission  was to ""increase awareness of the importance of federal funding to our public broadcasting system and to promote broad based support for its continuation.""While the message was political and certainly important, the protesters' chants were perhaps some of the most endearing that Washington has ever heard. The Washington Post reports that the battle cries included:“Power to the puppets! We can save the Muppets!”Some supporters couldn't make it to the march, but still wanted to participate. For example, Vanessa who is a mother of one toddler, created this video testimonial. She explained how essential ""Sesame Street"" was to her childhood, and added, ""I just want it to be there for my son."" It's a sentiment that many parents had already shared immediately following Romney's public ""attack"" on Big Bird. ""As a mother of two young girls (5 and 7) raised on PBS, my jaw dropped when Romney made that statement,"" Liz Gumbinner, who blogs at Mom 101, told The Huffington Post. The concept for the Million Puppet March was created by two strangers -- Michael Bellavia, 43, an animation executive from Los Angeles, and Chris Mecham, 46, a student in Idaho, Reuters reported. Before the first debate had even ended, Bellavia purchased the domain, www.millionmuppetmarch.com, and then realized that Mecham had coincidentally launched a Facebook page using the same name. The two connected shortly after the debate and began to plan the event. In addition to Saturday's rally, they have also started a petition to encouragement government to continue to fund public broadcasting. LOOK: The Million Puppet March takes Washington  "

But considering an appeals court upheld the sentence after Kerviel was accused of orchestrating $73 billion in what the Atlantic politely refers to as ""unauthorized trades,"" it's difficult to maintain a grounded sense of proportion.Jean Veil, one of the lawyers representing Societe Generale, told the Guardian the bank would take a ""realistic"" approach to recovering the $6.3 billion from Kerviel, whose sentence also includes three years in prison.One of Kerviel's lawyers, Olivier Metzner, previously explained to CNN he believes his client has been scapegoated for the financial crimes. He also asserted that the bank knew of Kerviel's actions but turned a blind eye because, though risky, they'd been profitable. ""The banks are the ones to blame for the banking system and the systematic economic crisis, not Jerome Kerviel,"" he told the station.According to the Associated Press, the 35-year-old Kerviel never personally profited from any of the trades."

Dozens of departing flights have been canceled at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport as a looming superstorm locks down flights to the East Coast. Hurricane Sandy continued on its path Monday, as the storm forced the shutdown of mass transit, schools and financial markets, sending coastal residents fleeing, and threatening a dangerous mix of high winds and soaking rain.ￂﾆ(AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c78f11f00002c00213b62.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Airlines cancelled over 20,254 flights from Saturday, Oct. 27 through Thursday, Nov. 1 in North America due to Hurricane Sandy, leaving thousands of passengers stranded across the nation and around the world.While it's still too early to determine the exact costs of the storm on the industry, at least one analyst who spoke with The Huffington Post said carriers could sustain hundreds of millions in losses due to the storm. Bob Mann, an airline industry analyst with R.W. Mann, Inc., told The Huffington Post via phone on Thursday that the ""overall revenue impact could be between $400 and $500 million total. The net loss for U.S. carriers is around $300 million."" Michael Steiner, executive vice president of Ovation Corporate Travel, offered a lower estimate. ""I would imagine the hit for the airlines will be in the tens of millions,"" Steiner told HuffPost via email. ""The airlines are still in triage mode trying to get travelers to their destinations and have probably not been taking in much additional revenue, as most is probably coming from canceled flights and exchanges. Flights are going to be full for the next week getting the stranded passengers back.""In an interview with TheStreet last week, Wolfe Trahan analyst Hunter Keay estimated Sandy's total impact on the seven most affected airlines -- which include American, Delta, JetBlue, US Airways, Southwest, Spirit and United -- to be $190 million on earnings before interest and taxes.How is loss determined in this case? In an interview with HuffPost, Mann offered an explanation. ""Here's the usual assumption: Passengers with unrefundable tickets make up roughly 70 percent of those flying, which airlines will end up earning back. 30 percent of passengers are either emergency or business travelers. Those trips don't necessarily recur, so that money is then lost for the airlines,"" he said. ""All told, roughly 25 percent of revenue is lost ... but that depends on how long service is suspended for. The airlines ask themselves at times like this: 'Is the cost of reconstructing the schedule balanced with the period during which no one is flying?' The airlines, at some airports, weren't flying for two and a half days. That's a period in which no one was flying and no one was burning fuel, which outweighs the cost of reconstructing the schedule.""One of the saving graces of all of this,"" Mann said, ""is that this is one of the few times of year when planes aren't absolutely full. It's the lull before the holidays.""So can you compare Sandy and Irene? ""It's very different,"" said Mann. ""Sandy was different than other storms because the geographic scope was wider and the scope of devastation was much bigger in terms of compromise of infrastructure, not just airports but also loss of power. Customers can't get to the airport, and even if they do arrive [at JFK, Newark or LaGuardia, for instance], they have no way to get them out of there to where they need to be. Locals, too, who work at the airports--maintenance, ramp workers, flight attendants, TSA -- if they don't have power, they can't get to work.""As for the individual airlines, JetBlue spokeswoman Allison Steinberg told HuffPost that it's far too early to tell the cost of the storm. Matt Miller, media relations representative for American Airlines, echoed the sentiment.On Friday, Delta released the following statement via email regarding its losses from Sandy:In response to Hurricane Sandy, Delta cancelled more than 3,500 flights in October, which caused a 2 percent system capacity reduction versus prior year. The company is estimating that the hurricane negatively impacted October revenues by $45 million and reduced October profit by approximately $20 million. Delta is still assessing the impact to November, but expects it to be less than October. Delta's October unit revenue improvement was approximately one point higher than it would have been without the hurricane impact.So who's right? Many domestic airlines could hint at Sandy's impact in their quarterly reports; otherwise only time will tell. ************************* The Huffington Post is eager for insights from our community, especially people with experience in power, infrastructure and engineering, on the adequacy of emergency preparation in advance of Hurricane Sandy, and the degree to which past disasters have informed adequate planning and construction.

As the economy continues to falter, many Americans are buying vitamins and health supplements in an attempt to stay healthy and avoid paying high medical bills. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c79f4240000510094b10f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Even though a major study recently published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showed that men who take a daily multivitamin have a lower risk of certain cancers, another study in the same journal now shows that daily multivitamin use does not seem to affect men's risk of cardiovascular events like heart attack or stroke. The study, conducted by researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, showed that daily multivitamin use did not seem to have any significant effect on stroke risk or heart attack risk. It did seem to play a small part in decreasing overall deaths, but researchers said this association was not statistically significant. The findings ""do not support multivitamin use to prevent CVD [cardiovascular disease], demonstrating the importance of long-term clinical trials of commonly used nutritional supplements,"" the researchers wrote in the study. ""Whether to take a daily multivitamin requires consideration of an individual's nutritional status, because the aim of supplementation is to prevent vitamin and mineral deficiency, plus consideration of other potential effects, including a modest reduction in cancer and other important outcomes in PHS II [Physicians' Health Study II trial] that will be reported separately.""The study included 14,641 male doctors who were part of the Physicians' Health Study II, who had an average age of 64, and who participated in the study from 1997 to 2011. The participants were randomly assigned to take either a multivitamin or a placebo. After about 11 years, there were 1,732 cases of cardiovascular events, which included 652 heart attacks (first-time only), 643 strokes and 829 deaths from heart-related causes. There were 2,757 men in total who had died at the follow-up period, and of those who died, 1,345 were assigned to take the multivitamin, while 1,412 were assigned to take the placebo. However, researchers didn't find any strong associations between multivitamin use and the heart risks. As many as one in three adults in the U.S. take a multivitamin each day, Next Avenue reported. However, research has been mixed on the benefits of taking one. As noted, a large study in JAMA showed that taking a multivitamin is linked with a lower risk of some cancers for men. But another study in the Archives of Internal Medicine study last year of more than 38,000 women showed that supplement use was linked with a 2.4 percent higher risk of death over nearly two decades, MyHealthNewsDaily reported. For multivitamins in particular, 40.8 percent of women who took a multivitamin every day died by the end of the study period, while 39.8 percent of women who died did not take a daily multivitamin. U.S. News reported that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force doesn't have a recommendation one way or another on multivitamin use -- it neither recommends them, nor recommends against them. However, there's still a lot to know, and experts generally recommend talking to your doctor to see if you need to take a multivitamin or another daily supplement due to deficiencies.Confused about whether you should take a multivitamin?

(AP Photo/Matt Slocum)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c79971f00005000213b93.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While many people are moving on with life as usual post-Sandy, others are still dealing with her wrath. Loss following the hurricane can come in different forms: financial, structural, emotional, energetic, physical, social or spiritual. It may even include the loss of a loved one.How can you cope with your loss and best move on? Here are seven tips to help you:1. Check your reasoning:  You are right; it is not fair that this happened to you. And while you are mourning your loss, really explore what you are saying to yourself as the explanation for what happened. For some people it may be, ""I am being punished."" Others may generalize: ""Life is horrible,"" or ""Why me?""While there are those who could argue these points, the real consideration is this: What will best help you get through this challenging time? The fact is, bad things happen to good people. (Yes, that is the title of a book. And it is true.)So allow yourself to go through the stages of mourning: depression, anger, denial and bargaining, and then get to the acceptance. Acceptance means you acknowledge what happened (and that bad things can happen in life) while choosing to move on. You choose to take this as a learning experience, as a reminder that life, people and experiences are precious and meant to be appreciated. Acceptance does not mean that you deserve what happened or that you ever wanted it. It does, however, allow you to let go of the anger, guilt, or overwhelming sadness and move on with the next phase of your life.2. Focus on what you still do have:  When we lose something or someone it is so easy to focus on that loss. While this is completely understandable, it is also important to see other parts of your life.I am not suggesting you deny what happened or even suppress emotions that are less than pleasant. However, I am recommending that you look at the whole picture.We have all heard of the proverbial glass half full vs. glass half empty. One indicates you are an optimist, the other a pessimist. But which is the actual, factual truth?The answer is ""both."" So while you are looking at the half that isn't there, try looking at what IS there. Focus on the people and things that are still in your life and how they make you feel. Maybe during this tough time, you have realized how many wonderful people you still have in your life. Or perhaps you have come into contact with complete strangers who are generously lending a hand. Make sure you are mindful of those experiences, too.3. Take care of your basic needs: During tough times, we often forget to take care of our basic needs such as getting the sleep and nutrition we need to optimally function. Unfortunately, this makes things worse, with less energy to function and greater emotional stress. Prioritize your health as you are coping with your loss to help you and those around you get through this difficult time. 4. Help out others: Reaching out and helping others can be very therapeutic for you. This does not mean to give all of your time and energy to others at the expense of your own needs. It does mean reaching out to a fellow human being and helping them in some way, even something as ""small"" as opening the door for a stranger or giving a heartfelt ""thank you"" to the cashier. Research shows that when we help out others, we feel happier and better connected.5. De-stress: Stress makes everything worse. It can increase depression and helplessness, cause our bodies to break down, result in strained relationships and make it hard (if not impossible) to do what needs to get done -- at home, work or anyplace else. Stress also causes us to only see the negative in a situation. While you may not realistically get rid of every ounce of stress, taking steps to better manage it can be incredibly powerful. Practice deep breathing, meditate, take a warm bath, do something fun or anything else to help you reduce stress in a healthy way.True, this will not change what has happened. It will improve your ability to deal with it.  6. Exercise: I call exercise the non-medical version of Xanax, only better. Research shows that exercise decreases stress and depression, improves our mood, helps us see things from a more positive perspective and boosts our resilience. While I realize the term ""exercise"" may not induce a lot of happiness in some, please realize any type of movement will be beneficial. Try jumping on a bed, dancing around the house or going for a walk with a friend.7. Use this as the opportunity to become who you really want to be: Sometimes traumatic events have an incredible way of turning our life around for the positive. During my years of training in psychology, I worked with people who had been diagnosed with cancer. My friends used to ask me, ""Isn't that depressing?"" but I had a completely different experience. So often, after my clients were diagnosed with cancer (regardless of the severity of their disease), they had a transformation in their lives. They started to reassess how they spent their time and energy. Workaholics realized that their loved ones were more important than the job and started to spend more time with family. People who had been holding a grudge forgave their loved ones. Individuals would stop beating themselves up about ""not being good enough"" and instead embrace who they were.Why not use this opportunity to make similar positive changes in your life?For more on emotional wellness, click here."
