1,WELLNESS,Why It's Never Just One Thing (Even Though We Pretend Otherwise),"Lisa Earle McLeod, Contributor

We know this, but yet we always want to find the one thing. The one thing that made everything go wrong.  Or the one thing that will make everything go right. The only problem is: It's never one thing.",2012-12-28,Teenage girl studying with textbooks looking unhappy,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cac033c00004c0009da38.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Life is complicated. We know this, but yet we always want to find the one thing. The one thing that made everything go wrong. Or the one thing that will make everything go right. The one thing the parent did wrong that made their kid turn to drugs. Or the one thing the entrepreneur did to revitalize their business. The one thing that caused a person to lose the deal, get sick, go bankrupt, get divorced, or go insane. We always want to know the one thing to do or not to do that will make everything OK.And when things are OK, we want to find one thing to blame. Because if one thing caused the problem, then one thing can fix it. The only problem is: It's never one thing. All the things are connected.My daughter was struggling in school. She found many of her classes excruciatingly boring and excruciatingly difficult. Not surprisingly, she was having trouble disciplining herself to study. I offered suggestions, ""Let's set up a study system."" ""Let's find some interesting You Tube videos on the subjects."" ""I can start quizzing you.""""But you don't understand, Mom"" she said. ""None of those things will fix it."" To which I answered, ""I do understand, you have a big problem and no single one of these things is going to 'fix' it. In fact we may never completely solve this big problem. But if we can find 10 things that will each improve the situation by 1 or 2 percent, it will make a difference.""When you do 10 things, you not only get the benefit of each thing, you also get a compounding effect. Like a snowball picking up weight as it goes downhill. Each flake gives the other flakes more energy and momentum. It wasn't what she wanted to hear. She wanted the one thing. And the one thing should be one thing that wouldn't cause her any pain, discomfort or extra effort. But life doesn't work that way. If you want to solve a big problem, you have to face reality and admit that it's never just one thing. It's lots of things. You can't just fix one thing; you have to fix all the things. Grownups know this. Sometimes we try to deny it, because one of the things that needs fixing is something that we should have fixed a long time ago, and we don't want to admit that it might have contributed to the really big problem. But let me be clear: Every minute that we waste trying to deny that our one pet thing is part of the problem, is a minute that we could be fixing that one thing, so that we could move onto the next thing so that all the things together could get us closer to solving the really big problem. Every snowflake in the avalanche claims it's not guilty. But if your child is the one crushed, you don't care which thing was 1 percent and which thing was 2 percent. You blame them all. Because together they created a situation where you have to wake up every single day with a black, jagged hole in your soul where your beautiful child used to sit. The people who say that their one thing didn't contribute to the problem are probably the people who don't have to face a black, jagged child-shaped hole in their soul.

2,COMEDY,A Revealing Marijuana Test,"John Cooker, Contributor
Author, Political Satirist",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marijuana-liberals_us_5bad11c4e4b04234e8567374,The Rastaman test has proven effective in sorting out who is infected with conservative opinions and who is infected with liberal ones... Individuals categorically reveal which they suffer from and can be truthfully labeled for proper treatment.,2012-12-28,"Former President Bill Clinton speaks at a rally for Barack Obama at Pullen Park in Raleigh, N.C., Sunday, Nov. 4, 2012. The former president has been traveling to several battleground states over the past week to try to stem any Republican tide for Mitt Romney and preserve Obama leads. (AP/Ted Richardson)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bad11c43c000066000b0deb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"You may not be able to determine whether an individual is a liberal or conservative until this simple test is conducted. It is called the Rastaman Test, pioneered by a famous Rastafarian. The individual must be asked to sit in an isolated room in which there has been a joint of marijuana lit then extinguished and taken away. He'll either notice immediately what the lingering aroma is and react by grinning widely and looking about to see if there's a smoldering joint somewhere, or he may react with a quick smile which is immediately dropped to hang a guilty, pensive expression, or he'll not have the faintest idea what the aroma is and act irritated at the smoky room.You should put on a wig of dreadlocks and speak in a slight Bob Marley accent when you enter. Ask some preliminary questions and pay attention to their demeanor. If the sufferer can't help himself and begins to talk in a voice like Cheech Marin with ""Hey, man, can you play some Grateful Dead tunes?"" or ""Hey, man, I think that's Panama Red in the air, ain't it?"" or ""You're not the fuzz, are you?"" He's a dead ringer for being infected with liberal opinions.In the second type of reaction, the individual will recognize the smell, but will evade it and appear nonchalant. He must be observed closely as his infection remains hidden. He'll act reserved and unresponsive, like he doesn't smell the elephant in the room. You'll detect a slight, sly joy urging a smile on his lips or sparkle in his eyes. He's hiding his recognition and fond remembrance of past experiences while wasted. This person has indulged in smoking the marijuana herb in his youth, but upon the threshold of maturing adulthood gave it up for the sake of responsibilities. He could be either infected with conservative or liberal opinions, and further probing is necessary.At this point, with some invented pretext, you simply pull out an ounce of herb and some rolling papers, lay them on a table, and ask the subject if he knows how to roll a joint. A conservative subject may immediately rise and exit. His conversion against marijuana is so strong, possibly anchored by a bad experience, like getting caught driving erratically at top speed of 15 mph in the passing lane on a 65-mph freeway with his head poked out the driver's door. He was looking down at the road so he could follow the white line because the whole car load of his friends kept laughing at the way the pilot (he) was swerving through the clouds. They kept asking when he was going to land this flight, for which the police kindly provided the colored flashing lights on the run/roadway.If he stays and attempts the joint rolling, you'll witness an uncoordinated effort from a conservative with herb falling out of the paper onto the table as he tries without dexterity to curl it around the loose leaves. The end result will invariably be an amateurish product packed too lightly with skinny ends and a fat middle, which burns too fast.A liberal will put a heaping amount of herb on the paper, held comfortably between his index fingers and thumbs, and curl the whole thing in one motion. His finished product will look like an unfiltered cigarette packed tightly and uniform, stuffed generously. You can tell he also enjoyed the process and may ask you to do a few more.The third type of individual will act like you're from some other planet. The smoke in the room is troublesome to him. He may stare or sneer at your dreadlocks. Watch his eyes and you'll find him searching the room uncomfortably but totally unaware of what the lingering aroma is. This subject is definitely suffering from conservative opinions.The critical part of the Rastaman test consists of a simple question: Have you ever inhaled marijuana before?A flat-out, emphatic ""No"" is 99 percent of the time a response from a conservative. He may be insulted you asked, though he may be lying and concealing a past event or time when he did indulge, usually during college.A cool ""Yes"" to the question 99 percent of the time will reveal a liberal. The majority will qualify that they had done this in their youth and no longer partake. They exhibit no need to hide their past indulgence or question why they did so. They may mumble something about conformity and exigencies of parenthood and employment as reasons for quitting.There are some who openly will admit to presently inhaling. They feel the herb has a beneficial effect as a remedy for just about every ailment known to civilization. They purport a conspiracy theory that the government is well aware of its numerous benefits to society, but, being influenced by conservative lobbyists, refuse to legalize it. Unfortunately, modern science has not proven so. Obviously it will alleviate some maladies, but in the long run it's been observed to heighten mild paranoia and entangle their espousing of conspiracy theories by the condition of ""cotton mouth"" which makes them unable to be coherent. Many of these liberals dream of moving to Montana to start dental floss ranches.There are others who are reluctant to admit yes. They attribute no positive effects about their past experience and hardly crack a smile when discussing it. Now they're driven individuals, and that stuff only slows you down and makes the world wacky, which it most assuredly can't be or else why would they be working 80 hours a week? They've buried their memories of past inhaling along with that bearded, guitar-playing boyfriend or theater major nympho girlfriend whom they were crazy about in college. They're mostly infected with conservative opinions, though some are with liberal.Then there's the unusual response that they smoked a joint but didn't inhale. This seems to have fooled no one except the subject. The Rastaman test unequivocally places them under the influence of conservative opinions even though they associate with liberals. Their intense need to be wanted and loved by everyone, and I mean everyone, fit in well with their college days under the influence of liberal opinions. The results are constant compromise, constant shading of the truth and the inability to admit they inhaled.The Rastaman test has proven effective in sorting out who is infected with conservative opinions and who is infected with liberal ones. With this simple test, individuals categorically reveal which they suffer from and can be truthfully labeled for proper treatment."

Although I had never thought to own a pooch due to time constraints and general selfishness, I do not deny purposefully befriending dog owners just to hang out with their pets. But things have changed. Contrary to suspicion, it is not the aging, biologically-driven desire to shelter and care for others that is causing me to reconsider owning a hound. It's quite the opposite, really -- I am simply looking to be cared for. Dogs have been famous for saving their owners in the event of an emergency. From calling 911 and reporting fires to dragging owners from oncoming trains, it seems as if dogs truly deserve the title of man's best friend. Training pups for their amazing sense of smell is another perk to having a mutt around. This is especially true in the workplace. Research in animal physiology suggest that a dog's muzzle is more than 10,000 times more sensitive in perceiving odors than the capabilities of a human nose. It is no wonder then why police departments have successfully trained canines to detect illicit drugs through smell. These past few years, a slew of scientific journals have pumped out several cases of dogs performing sensory feats within the field medicine. Just this month, the British Medical Journal released a study showing that canines can accurately sniff out one of the most problematic hospital-acquired infections of our time. Clostridium difficile is a bacterium known for causing intractable diarrhea, abdominal pain and even ruptured bowels in an afflicted patient. Researchers in the Netherlands trained a 2-year-old beagle to sniff out the baneful bug in infected feces and patient rooms. When challenged with a series of infected and non-infected samples, the pup was able to correctly identify 100 percent of infected stool and 98 percent of all uninfected cases. If follow-up studies maintain this accuracy, the integration of canine surveillance of Clostridium difficile in a hospital setting may not only prevent patients from being diagnosed late in the disease course but also may indirectly shave off significant diagnostic expenses from patients' hospital bills.German investigators put dogs on another medical task, this time identifying lung cancers by scenting organic compounds in the breath of affected patients. Lung cancer in this study was correctly detected in 70 percent of all patients afflicted with the disease. Importantly, these clever canines were able to identify 90 percent of unaffected patients as not having lung cancer. Although not providing the diagnostic accuracy that I would be comfortable with utilizing in patient care, this study gives further evidence to a dog's promising value in the field of medicine.As a man who assumes the community role of a health care provider and the personal role of a chronic hypochondriac, the potential for canines in medical care may just be the last straw I need to finally become the dog owner that I never thought I'd become. As for cats? I'll pass.For more by Brian Secemsky, M.D., click here.For more health news, click here."
