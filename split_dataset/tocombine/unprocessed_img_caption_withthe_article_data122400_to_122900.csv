Die Investmentbank Morgan Stanley hat scharfe Kritik an der Arbeit des baden-wuerttembergischen Rechnungshofes im Zusammenhang mit der EnBW-Affaere geaeussert. Nach einem Bericht der ""Stuttgarter Nachrichten"" (Mittwochausgabe vom 26.09.12) haelt die Investmentbank der Kontrollbehoerde schlampige Arbeit vor. ""Der Rechnungshof hat die Erkenntnisquellen beliebig und sachwidrig beschraenkt"", heisst es in einem 20-seitigen Schreiben, das am Dienstag an den Landtags-Untersuchungsausschuss, die Landtagsfraktionen sowie den Rechnungshof versandt wurde.

The severity of the pay cut varies, but some top earners are seeing payouts cut by half. The new system applies when more than 70 percent of the business from a client comes from those deals.Morgan Stanley is hoping that a drastic cut in this kind of compensation will spur brokers to sell more products, such as mutual funds, loans and financial planning services, to those clients, according to several Morgan Stanley advisers.At the same time, the bank is hoping the move could force clients who want continued access to hot IPOs to put more of their assets with the firm's wealth management business. Morgan Stanley has underwritten the Facebook and Twitter IPOs and is also expected to win the assignment for the forthcoming offering from Chinese ecommerce giant Alibaba Group.Morgan Stanley spokeswoman Christine Jockle confirmed the change in the broker compensation policy. She said it was meant to ensure that new offerings were distributed more broadly across the client base.Archrival Merrill Lynch, a unit of Bank of America Corp , has not made similar changes to its compensation structure, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. Wall Street recruiters said they think that only Morgan Stanley has made such a move among the bigger brokers.While the change at Morgan Stanley was detailed internally in November in a lengthy document that outlined the wealth unit's 2014 compensation structure, some advisers realized it was happening only after it was implemented and their pay checks dropped in recent weeks according to several advisers.The advisers who spoke with Reuters said many of the bank's roughly 16,426 financial advisers are now unhappy. They said the change could repel clients who use the bank to get access to new issues. Access to hot IPOs and new bond issues can also be make-or-break for building new client relationships and maintaining existing ones.The average retail broker at Morgan Stanley typically gets no more than a few hundred shares per client for popular IPOs that the firm underwrites, said one of the advisers, who requested anonymity because he did not want to be seen criticizing his own firm.""I got 100 shares of Twitter for a guy when they went public, and I'm sure he won't be happy if he wants something else and I tell him it's not available,"" the adviser said. ""It's not a good situation.""Morgan Stanley uses its retail brokerage in seeking to win stock and bond underwriting assignments, saying the size of its sales force gives it an advantage over Wall Street rivals. The bank was ranked No. 1 for equity underwriting fees in the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.At the same time, the bank is also trying to improve the profit margins in its wealth management unit, which now accounts for about 40 percent of the company's revenue, looking at both increasing assets under management and selling clients more products.Morgan Stanley has been tweaking its incentive structure for advisers the past few years to align with its business goals. The 2014 compensation policy, for example, also included bonuses for making loans as well as incentives to brokers who could convince clients to tell Morgan Stanley what assets they hold outside the firm as that gives advisers the chance to pitch for them.

1,COLLEGE,Another University Stops Students From Passing Out Copies Of The Constitution,Clarke Reilly,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hawaii-constitution-lawsuit-university-students_n_5216705.html,,2014-04-26,The State University of New York College at Oswego,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae4b963c000018010b6a97.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Two students from the University of Hawaii at Hilo are suing the school, claiming their constitutional rights were violated when they were barred from handing out copies of the United States Constitution. In a federal lawsuit filed Thursday, Merritt Burch and Anthony Vizzone claim their First Amendment right to free speech was infringed upon during a January event where school officials stopped them as they passed out copies of the Constitution, according to Fox News. Burch and Vizzone, who were there to represent the campus’ chapter of Young Americans for Liberty, were told that campus policy dictates members of clubs and organizations are not allowed to approach fellow students and solicit them.The complaint also states that the university “unconstitutionally restricts access to open areas on campus by requiring students to seek permission to speak at least seven business days in advance.”Without getting prior permission, students who wish to exercise their freedom are relegated to a small “free speech zone” on the edge of campus, which the students’ lawyers say is not particularly accessible or in a high-traffic area.Greg Lukianoff, president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, which is assisting in the lawsuit, went so far as to call the undesirable zone a “censorship swamp.”“The First Amendment is not optional at public colleges -- it’s the law,” Lukianoff said in a statement. “Enforcing restrictive ‘free speech zone’ policies that prevent students from passing out copies of the Constitution is impossible to justify.”According to the plaintiffs’ attorney, Bob Corn-Revere, “Part of the paradox is the idea that on a state campus, the exercise of constitutional rights can be confined to a zone, to one-quarter of 1 percent of the campus.” The University of Hawaii issued a statement saying it has begun “a review of the policies involved and the manner in which they were enforced.” It also noted the university “is committed to free expression and the open exchange of ideas.”Despite the lawsuit, the chapter of Young Americans for Liberty doesn't appear to be hampered by the campus policies. Burch, who is the chapter’s president, published a blog post on the Young Americans for Liberty website the same day the lawsuit was filed, boasting the success of an April 17 event on U.S. national debt. The post specifically points out how the event raised the organization’s profile to students on campus and the surrounding community. “We attracted the attention of hundreds of students and managed to get almost 40 new signups for our club,” wrote Burch. She added their event also made the local newspaper’s front page.Burch and Vizzone's lawsuit repeats a similar situation at another American campus. In February, the law firm Davis Wright Tremaine, which is also representing the Hawaii students, helped a California college student win a $50,000 settlement after he was stopped from handing out copies of the Constitution."

It's shape was derived from the traditional 'dhow', the local fishing boats of the Arabian Gulf. (Photo by Qatar 2022 via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7556d200000c501015cf0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Qatar beat out the United States, Japan, South Korea and Australia to be named host of the 2022 World Cup in December 2010 there were concerns in the media and within soccer's governing body that the event had been ""bought."" The  wealthy nation's historic bid to bring the World Cup to the Middle East called for air-conditioned stadiums, promised billions of dollars in infrastructure improvement and came with the paid-for seal of approval of French soccer legend Zinedine Zidane. Not even four years after BBC Sport proclaimed ""Money is no object"" when listing the small oil- and gas-rich nation's strengths as a possible host for the World Cup, there are indications that organizers may be unwilling or unable to actually pay for staging the event as planned. The Qatar organizing committee’s senior manager for projects, Ghanim Al Kuwari, recently revealed the country would be building just eight stadiums, as opposed to the originally announced 12, reported Bloomberg News. The organizers of the Qatar World Cup subsequently admitted that construction plans were being revisited.""This is the same process that all FIFA World Cup host nations undergo. For Qatar, the process of selecting the final proposed lineup of host venues is ongoing,"" the Qatar 2022 Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy said in a statement obtained by The Associated Press. ""The requirement is a minimum of 8 and a maximum of 12.""Brazil is expected to use 12 stadiums for the 2014 World Cup and 10 were used in South Africa for the 2010 World Cup. The last time a World Cup was hosted in eight or fewer stadiums was 1978 in Argentina, according to MLSSoccer.com. “Their decision was motivated by cost-cutting following an assessment of the real needs on the ground,” John Sfakianakis, chief investment strategist at investment company MASIC in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, said in an e-mail to Bloomberg News. “It does always make good sense to do necessary cost-cutting and reviews of capex for such huge projects that are front-loaded.”A Winter World Cup?The number of stadiums constructed might not even be the biggest difference between the plans Qatar initially touted to FIFA and the reality in 2022. With average daytime temperatures of 106 degrees Fahrenheit in the Middle Eastern nation during summer months and an architect involved in one of the largest stadiums dismissing the bold air-conditioning claims, the 2022 World Cup may make an unprecedented moved from June and July to November and December.""If it's played between November 15 and the end of December, that is when the weather is most favorable,"" FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke told a French radio station in January, reported CNN.FIFA president Sepp Blatter has also publicly addressed moving the World Cup to winter. ""I caused a stir a few months ago by saying that we had to take a lead and see if we could play in winter. Because 45 degrees Celsius in summer, it's not possible. FIFA's Executive Committee therefore decided to make some consultations, the results of which need to be waited for,"" Blatter told weekly soccer magazine France Football in January, via ESPNFC. ""We'll take a decision at the end of this year if possible, or in 2015. There's no rush. Personally, I think that if there's a will, there's a way.""Construction And CorruptionAs FIFA ponders a potential change in season for the 2022 World Cup, the construction already in progress in Qatar has come under intense scrutiny for possible human rights violations. In September 2013, the Guardian reported that dozens of migrant workers from Nepal had already died and that thousands more ""face exploitation and abuses that amount to modern-day slavery."" The International Trade Union Confederation followed up in March with a scathing report alleging labor and human rights abuses after visiting labor camps near Doha. That report claimed migrant workers were toiling in ""unbelievable heat"" six days a week and dying in ""unprecedented numbers."" Citing data from the Indian and Nepalese embassies, the report estimated that up to 4,000 more workers could die before the 2022 World Cup.Within days of the ITUC report, FIFA was facing calls to address the alleged abuses of migrant workers as well as dealing with a new damning report about internal corruption. In March, The Telegraph alleged that Jack Warner, the former FIFA vice president, was paid $1.2 million from a company controlled by former Qatari soccer official Mohamed Bin Hammam not long after the vote on the 2022 World Cup host. Payments to Warner's sons were also made by the same company, reported The Telegraph. Bin Hammam was the president of the Asian Football Confederation and a member of FIFA's 24-man executive committee at the time of the vote for the host of the 2022 World Cup. Both have since resigned from their positions. ""If two of the most senior people in world football could have been involved in a scandal like this, how broad did it go? FIFA have never really answered these questions,"" Damian Collins, a U.K. member of parliament, said to The Telegraph.In hopes of addressing such concerns, FIFA's independent ethics commission is investigating claims of bribery over the 2022 World Cup vote as well as the vote that awarded the 2018 World Cup to Russia. ""An investigation is being run by [New York lawyer] Michael Garcia and the commission is interviewing all those involved in the case and it will soon be delivered to the [FIFA] ethics committee that is going to decide if any measures should be taken,"" Valcke told reporters on Friday, via Reuters. ""That will be soon, maybe we will have a decision before the 2014 World Cup.""  "

4,POLITICS,The US Should Accept Palestinian Unity,"James Zogby, ContributorPresident, Arab American Institute; author, 'Arab Voices'",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-us-should-accept-pale_b_5218083.html,"Putting aside all these displays of faux anger and misplaced regret, the Palestinians are right to celebrate. Reconciliation and national unity are not only good, in and of themselves, they are necessary if there is to be a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace.",2014-04-26,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu attends the weekly cabinet meeting at his office in Jerusalem, Israel, Sunday, Nov. 24, 2013. After feverishly trying to derail the international community's nuclear deal with Iran in recent weeks, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu now has little choice but to accept an agreement that he has derided as deeply flawed. (AP Photo/Abir Sultan, Pool)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8c61f2400005000576dc6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"While Palestinians celebrated the reconciliation agreement signed between Fateh and Hamas, the reactions in Washington and Israel were reminiscent of the biblical ""weeping and gnashing of teeth."" American political commentators were dumbfounded by the news of the pact, terming it ""a dark day,"" ""a setback for peace"" or ""a serious complication."" Members of Congress, meanwhile, were uniform in their threats to withhold aid if the Palestinian Authority goes forward with the unity arrangement. Israeli government reactions were predictably harsh in their criticism of the Palestinian move. Those on the far right, who never supported the ""peace process"" in the first place and who had threatened to abandon the Netanyahu government if he signed any agreement with the Palestinians, saw the Fateh/Hamas pact as justification to call for an immediate end to the peace negotiations. I detected more joy than anger in their overly-heated pronouncements. Prime Minister Netanyahu had undoubtedly the most disingenuous line of the day, asking of PA President Mahmoud Abbas ""does he want peace with Hamas or peace with Israel?"" -- as if to suggest that ""peace with Israel"" was actually in the offing but for Abbas' ""disappointing"" decision. Putting aside all these displays of faux anger and misplaced regret, the Palestinians are right to celebrate. Reconciliation and national unity are not only good, in and of themselves, they are necessary if there is to be a lasting Israeli-Palestinian peace. In the first place, the Palestinian people desperately want this unity in order to put their political house in order. They know that they have no viable future living in two captive Bantustans. In the face of continued existential challenges, the public has been demoralized by their squabbling fractured leadership. Increasingly frustrated with their divided leaders' failure or inability to bring an end to occupation, there has been a growing sense that unity would provide a solution. In a world that was out of control, healing their internal division was the one thing they felt they could control. Unity, of course, is not magical and will not, by itself, produce independence. But the public's instinct was nevertheless right in understanding that unity, on the right terms, would be essential for independence.It is also important to understand the degree to which the leaderships of both the PA and Hamas were facing challenges to their legitimacy. During the past seven years, Hamas had made a mess of their rump ""statelet"" in Gaza. Their indiscriminate rocket fire and deplorable use of suicide bombers, which they bizarrely termed ""resistance,"" had only served to damage the Palestinian movement and image. At the same time, this behavior and the insecurity it created among Israelis had empowered Israeli hardliners enabling them to impose cruel collective punishment that brought increased suffering to the entire Gaza Strip. Hamas, reduced to badly managing an impoverished population, was facing growing dissatisfaction with both their ideology and their governance. Polls now show that this once popular Islamic movement had a significantly diminished support-base. The Palestinian Authority, thanks to Israeli ill-will and intransigence has fared no better. They had made a strategic decision to pursue a non-violent path to liberation by cooperating with the US and negotiating with Israel. Their reward: they became financially dependent on the US and Israel; they were repeatedly humiliated by aggressive and acquisitive Israeli settlement expansion; and they continued to be subjected to Israel's efforts to impose its will on their every move. As a result, the Palestinian public had become increasingly cynical, despairing of the possibility of peace. And so in the face of a new breakdown in negotiations, Israel's refusal to deliver on a promised release of prisoners, and the announcement of yet another expansion of settlements, Palestinians turned instead to heal their divided polity.   From what we know of the terms of the Fateh/Hamas pact, it provides for the establishment of a national unity government of technocrats. This government will serve for several months preparing for national elections. The agreement also empowers President Abbas to continue negotiations and endorses his leadership in seeking a two-state solution that provides for peace between Israel and an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza with its capital in East Jerusalem. While Israel has flat out rejected the reconciliation, the success of this effort to establish unity will depend on the US response. Up until now, the Administration has not formally rejected the agreement and has been somewhat circumspect in their comments. It would be a fatal error if, without finding out the exact terms of the reconciliation pact, the US were to have rejected it out of hand and punish the PA. Likewise, it would be an enormous error if the US were to force President Abbas to turn his back on the pact. This has happened before. At this point, such a move would not be accepted by the Palestinian public and would severely compromise the PA leadership. If, as senior Palestinian spokesmen affirm, the terms of the agreement comply with the well-known Quartet conditions, the US would be well-advised to be supportive of the effort and insist that Israel continue negotiations with a now-strengthened Abbas."

Ball, who died on April 26, 1989, would have celebrated her 100th birthday on Saturday, Aug. 6, 2011. (AP Photo/file)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb669d52100000001c8b228.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It's been 25 years since Lucille Ball passed away, but Lucy is still very much alive in our hearts and homes. More than 40 million Americans binge-watch reruns each year, according to some estimates, and nearly 9 million viewers tuned in over the holidays to watch the ""I Love Lucy"" colorized Christmas special.While many popular TV shows have come and gone, few have the timeless hold over audiences like ""I Love Lucy."" It's safe to say the star of the show has more than a little something to do with that, whether you loved Ball for her comedic timing or her zany persona. Who can forget Vitameatavegamin? Or the chocolate factory episode? We asked our Facebook and Twitter fans what made Lucy so unforgettable, both on-screen and off-screen, and were overwhelmed by the response. Here are five things we still love about Lucy.1. She knew how to make fun of herself. Nobody knew comic timing quite like Lucy. No idea was too far-fetched, no get-up was too over-the-top, and there were really no limits to what Lucy would do to get a laugh. And we love her for it.  ""Lucy was silly. We need more silly in this world,"" said reader Al Shil.2. Her humor was good, clean fun. Pure and simple.  When was the last time you watched a TV show that didn't involved cursing or a sex scene? ""I Love Lucy"" was one of the few shows the entire family could sit together and enjoy. No worrying about awkward moments with your parents -- Lucy and Ricky didn't even share a bed! ""It was always possible to be entertained by a good laugh, everytime! NO blood and guts, no sex, just good humor! She was a hoot!"" said reader Anise Winokur Singer. 3. Her beauty (and that smile).  The tall, statuesque small-screen star was undeniably gorgeous with her alabaster complexion, fiery red hair, and expertly arched brows. Before she made it in Hollywood, Lucy started off her career as a fashion model, calling herself ""Diane Belmont."" But the best part is, it wasn't her looks that made her famous. We think reader Jane Thompson put it best. ""She was a beautiful woman but capitalized on humor, style, and wit,"" Thompson said. 4. Her friendship with Ethel is one for the ages.  Anytime you put these two together, was a recipe for trouble. They enabled each other's bad behavior and egged on each other's worst ideas, but when it came down to it, they were always there for each other. Everyone needs a best friend like that.  5. She was a strong, confident woman. It's hard to think of Lucille as anyone other than the happy-go-lucky character she played on TV. But life wasn't always easy. Believe it or not, as a teenager, she was told by a New York City drama school that she was too ""shy and reticent"" to become a success. And though she proved them wrong, it took lots of time. ""Her tv persona was silly, her real life was difficult but she seemed to be an exceptional woman who weathered her storms with integrity,"" said reader Michelle Etheridge. What do you still love about Lucy? Let us know in comments below!"

""We have sold other letters from the Titanic but none have reached anything like this price.""The Titanic sank on the night of Sunday 14 April 1912, on the fifth day of its first voyage from Southampton to New York.Over 1,500 passengers and crew lost their lives in the tragedy, including Hart's husband Benjamin.The letter, written on special stationery headed ""On board RMS 'Titanic'"" and complete with an envelope embossed with the White Star Line flag, was intended to be delivered to Hart's mother in Chadwell Heath, east London.It tells how Esther Hart was suffering the effects of sea-sickness and feeling the cold.""My dear ones all,"" it begins. ""As you see it is Sunday afternoon and we are resting in the library after luncheon. I was very bad all day yesterday could not eat or drink and sick all the while, but today I have got over it.""The sailors say we have had a wonderful passage up to now.

He did not survive the disaster.Hart and Eva, who later recalled the events of the liner's last hours in her autobiography ""Shadow of the Titanic"", were rescued by HMS Carpathia.In the book, Eva wrote of her mother: ""The letter she had written that Sunday afternoon on the Titanic was never posted. She found it in the pocket of my father's sheepskin-lined coat after we had been rescued and for her it was to remain a constant reminder of that tragic journey and of the loss of her husband.""Eva died in 1996 aged 91.

Asked by the Beattyville Enterprise about his plan for bringing jobs to Lee County, Ky., McConnell appeared to look in a different direction. “Economic development is a Frankfort issue,” McConnell said, referring to the state capitol. “That is not my job. It is the primary responsibility of the state Commerce Cabinet.”Grimes went after McConnell's comments Thursday in a phone interview with the Huffington Post, saying that the only job he cares about is his own.""I stand in complete contrast and disagreement with him,"" Grimes said. ""Unlike Mitch McConnell, I listen to Kentuckians. It is the job of a U.S. senator to put hardworking Kentucky families back to work and to grow our middle class. He shocked not just myself but all of Kentucky when he declared that economic development is not his job.""McConnell responded to the Beattyville Enterprise report in a statement, claiming his comments were misinterpreted.""Unfortunately, it seems my message got lost in translation, and I was surprised to see a headline about my visit that sent the exact opposite message to the one I was trying to convey,"" the statement read.

Set in rural Texas, the opera is essentially a 90-minute operatic monologue that tells the story of the star-crossed life and unhappy marriage of Myrtle Bledsoe , elegantly portrayed by von Stade. Myrtle looks back over her life -- her dreams, her wrong decisions and her regrets over her troubled marriage to the philandering Hunter Bledsoe (David Matranga). Playwright Foote, who was supremely skilled at capturing the lives of his subjects, particularly women whose lives and talents were wasted, withering away in loveless marriages in desolate Texas towns. Gordon's music and Foglia's libretto perfectly capture the hopelessness of Myrtle's predicament as her dreams are slowly shattered. But it is the enormous talent of von Stade -- not only her powerful and evocative voice -- but also her extraordinary acting gifts, that transform the opera into a tour de force. The wonderful details of von Stade's performance, from the subtle delicacy of her West Texas accent to the small, wistful gestures of her character, are transcendent and powerful. This is a performer of towering grace and achievement who has found a vehicle that is perfectly suited to her talents. All the elements of this production seem to fall effortlessly into place, from the striking set by Riccardo Hernandez and lighting by Brian Nason, to the fine musical direction by conductor Kathleen Kelly. Performances by a gospel chorus of Cheryl D. Clansy, Laura Elizabeth Patterson, James M. Winslow and Jawan CM Jenkins offer a spiritual grace note that adds even more power to the production. And performances in supporting roles by Carolyn Johnson, Cecilia Duarte and Adam Noble provide additional texture to the power of von Stade's portrayal."

I recognise Israel and it would recognise Israel. I reject violence and terrorism,"" he said.The deal between Hamas and Abbas's Fatah party envisions agreement on a government of independent technocrats within five weeks and holding elections at least six months later.Hamas's continued opposition to Israel did not necessarily contradict Abbas, as both sides have agreed that the unity government will not include Hamas members and will instead be made up of independent technocrats.Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri told Reuters: ""The recognition of Israel by the president of the Palestinian Authority, Mahmoud Abbas, is not new. What is important is that Hamas did not and will never recognise Israel.""Abbas seeks a Palestinian state in Gaza, the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, lands Israel captured in a 1967 war.Hamas, which seized control of Gaza from Abbas's secular Fatah in 2007, retains thousands of fighters and an arsenal of rockets. It has fought repeated battles with Israel since it took control of the enclave.A senior U.S. official said on Thursday that a unity government could call into question some $500 million in their annual security and budget aid to Abbas.A future Palestinian government must ""unambiguously and explicitly commit to non-violence, recognition of the state of Israel, and acceptance of previous agreements and obligations between the parties,"" the official told Reuters on condition of anonymity.WILLING TO EXTEND TALKSAbbas on Saturday added that he was still ready to extend stalled peace talks with Israel, as long as it met long-standing demands to free prisoners and halt building on occupied land.Commentators said the discussions had already hit a brick wall and the United States had been struggling to extend the talks beyond an original April 29 deadline for a peace accord.Abbas, for the first time since the suspension, said he was open to re-starting the talks and pushing on beyond the deadline. There was no immediate response from Israeli negotiators.""How can we restart the talks? There's no obstacle to us restarting the talks but the 30 prisoners need to be released,"" Abbas said.""On the table we will present our map, for three months we'll discuss our map. In that period, until the map is agreed upon, all settlement activity must cease completely,"" he told the officials, who were gathered for a two-day conference to assess the Palestinian strategy for achieving statehood.Talks had veered toward collapse after Israel failed to release a final group of Palestinian prisoners it had promised to free in March, and after Abbas signed several international treaties, which Israel said was a unilateral move towards statehood.The peace talks resumed in July after a three-year deadlock. The two sides were at odds over Israeli settlement construction in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, activity most countries deem illegal, and over Abbas's refusal to accept a demand by Prime Minister Netanyahu that he recognize Israel as a Jewish state.

How's it going, amidst very predictable distractions from Russia and Israel? Fair to middling.Obama told Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and their audience in Japan what they wanted to hear -- that the US-Japan mutual security treaty will bring in the US on the side of Japan if war breaks out with China over the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea -- while making it clear to both Tokyo and Beijing that it would be odd for them to fight over some rock piles in the middle of the ocean. Then Obama went to South Korea, greeted upon arrival there by news that North Korea may be prepping another nuclear test in honor of his Pacific sojourn. If you think you've seen this movie before, you have. The difference this time is that the kid dictator was supposed to be more interested in material rather than martial doings, following sage counsel under the wing of his wise uncle. That would be his wise uncle whom he had executed.Is the administration's misread of North Korea a failure of intelligence or a failure of imagination, which is intelligence of a different sort?Or is it a failure of bandwidth, of being a fairly insular administration whose otherwise impressive intellectual abilities are distracted by other matters?In any event, he also told South Korean President Park Geun-hye what she and her domestic audience wanted to hear. That it is time for Japan to stop denying wrongdoing during the bad old imperial days in the first half of the 20th century and acknowledge the frequently exploitative and brutal Japanese behavior toward their Korean subjects. And that it's especially time to do that with regard to the so-called ""comfort women,"" Korean women forced to work in brothels for Japanese soldiers. From South Korea, Obama moved on to Malaysia for the rest of the weekend, and the first American presidential visit since that of Lyndon Johnson in the 1960s. Obama closes out his Asia-Pacific tour on Monday and Tuesday in the Philippines, an archipelago nation of some 7000 islands (with nearly all in the 12th most populous country in the world concentrated on a handful of islands) and one of his most important stops of all. It will be the first ever visit of this unusually well-traveled American politician, who had seen much of the world before ever becoming president, with a special emphasis on the Pacific Basin in which he grew up.Obama should close and announce an important new deal with the former American colony for a renewed regular rotational presence of US forces in Philippine bases. It will be interesting to see how directly Obama addresses what Filipinos regard as the bullying behavior of China toward its much smaller neighbor on the South China Sea, where Chinese forces are trying to claim islands and waters not far from the Philippines themselves as part of the People's Republic's breathtaking insistence that it has sovereignty over one of the world's most strategically significant seas.But that's the close of the tour.What has Obama accomplished with Japan and South Korea, the other two parts of what could be a very powerful tripartite alliance?With Japan, he probably assuaged some concerns about the state of the longstanding mutual security alliance between Washington and Tokyo. Other senior US officials had confirmed that a Chinese move on the Senkaku Islands would trigger US intervention under the treaty. But Prime Minister Abe, who did graduate work in public policy at the University of Southern California, wanted to hear it from Obama. China certainly took note, criticizing the statement, though in notably muted fashion. Obama made it clear he would regard a decision by China and Japan to go to war over the Senkakus as foolishness. But if it came about as part of an attempt by China to seize the islands, long held by Japan, or by actively enforcing the air defense zone China declared over much of the East China Sea, that would constitute aggression and an attack upon a key US ally under the treaty.Obama also, I'm told, in private discussion with Abe, reiterated points made previously by other US officials about the need for Japan to cool concerns about its past imperial aggression in the Pacific War and earlier. That's key for the alliance with South Korea to work smoothly. And with Japan -- which in the Asia-Pacific can be a far more powerful and capable active ally than any the US ever had in the Middle East or Central Asia -- upgrading its military in the face of China's big build-up, that will be an important factor.Of course, one of the most interesting things about Obama's splashy visit to Tokyo, complete with a state dinner in honor of America at the Imperial Palace, is what did not happen. There was no big trade deal to announce, no next big step toward completion of the Trans Pacific Partnership. It turns out that Japan is no more interested in giving up its subsidy and protection programs in agriculture and other areas than many people in the US are.There's no fast track authority for the TPP. I think that at least part of the Obama Administration agreed to a corporate wish list they knew would never get through, between opposition in the Democratic Party, elements of the Republican Party, ingrained interests in Asian nations.The Asia-Pacific Pivot away from our fateful fixation on the Islamic world of the Middle East and Central Asia to the rising Asia-Pacific region is much more about emerging power relations in what we laughingly call the global order, not another overarching free trade agreement, though there is plenty of trade to conducted. This is much more about the Navy than Wall Street, Alfred Thayer Mahan rather than Milton Friedman.The concern among allies in the region about the evident hyper-partisan dysfunctionality of Washington -- Obama's trip having been postponed from last year due to the bizarre federal government shutdown -- and Obama's distractions elsewhere is much more about security and the rise of China than it is about notions of free trade. It's important to remember that China isn't even part of the Trans Pacific Partnership. That exclusion is the most important thing about the TPP, because it reflects the deeper reality of the Asia-Pacific Pivot, the desire to contain China while continuing to engage China.With regard to South Korea, the best thing that happened is what did not happen. Or, at least, what has not happened so far. That would be another North Korean test, of either a nuclear weapon or a next-generation ballistic missile. Obama is safely away from the Korean peninsula with that particular shoe left undropped.If Kim Jong-un wanted to mount a deeply serious provocation, he would have conducted the test with Obama close at hand. But the slight sigh of relief occasioned by North Korea refraining from the test, at least while Obama was in the near vicinity, has to be accompanied by a much larger sigh of frustration. For the US has simply gotten North Korea wrong for a very long time. Perhaps it's because of our own unique set of blinders.Coming from a deeply materialist and hardly historically minded society, it's evidently difficult for quite a few Americans to grasp why North Korea would not be ultimately motivated by money. The impoverished nation could benefit from Western investment and the development of a consumer society.But then it would just be, at best, another mediocre nation with a market orientation, a place cast in deep shadow by its far more succcessful neighbor glittering to the south. Instead of what it is, a nuclear power that commands attention as potentially one of the more disruptive nations on the planet.We'll see if North Korea acts during the back end of the Obama tour. It's safe to say that China will have a reaction after Obama leaves Manila in a few days. I'll have a lot more to say about the re-emerging US alliance with the Philippines.We'll also see if the key to settling the Ukraine crisis, guaranteeing that NATO won't be a few hundred miles from Moscow, is any closer to reality. If not, all the saber rattling around Ukraine, a place with relatively minimal strategic significance for the US but immense strategic significance to Russia, may push Russia and China closer to a powerful alliance of their own.William Bradley Archive"

The late Pope John Paul II and Pope John XXIII will be canonised on Sunday 27 April, inside the Vatican when 800,000 pilgrims from around the world are expected to attend. (Photo by Dan Kitwood/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7e5e92000009900018527.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Tom Heneghan, Religion EditorApril 25 (Reuters) - When the late Popes John XXIII and John Paul II are declared saints on Sunday, the Vatican ceremony will be both a spiritual event for Roman Catholicism and a lesson in the subtle politics of the world's largest church.Most of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics will generally agree that these two men, in their own ways, were holy and charismatic pastors who helped their 2,000-year-old Church to confront the challenges of the modern era.When it comes to details, though, opinions will diverge. The debates are long and complex, but the popular notion of John as a liberal champion and John Paul as a conservative stalwart gives a rough outline of how they are seen.As such, they symbolise two groups in the Catholic Church that have disagreed for decades, sometimes bitterly, over how to interpret the results of the reforming Second Vatican Council of 1962-1965 that John launched and John Paul largely implemented.By canonising both, Argentine-born Pope Francis will be using the symbolism of unity to urge Catholics to look beyond these divisions to join together in following the Gospel.""These two popes represent different wings of the Church,"" said Ashley McGuire of the Catholic Association, a Washington-based lay group that defends Catholic views on public issues.""Unity is a big theme of Pope Francis's papacy. He's saying we're all Catholics, we're on a common journey together."" UNITY AND DIVERSITYWhile popes symbolise the unity of the Church, each one has his own priorities. Some are put into words in sermons and encyclicals, others into deeds in appointments of bishops and cardinals or choices of candidates to declare as saints.""Canonising popes can be politically divisive in the Church when it is an attempt by one faction to impose its model of the papacy on the future by bolstering the legacy of its favourite pope,"" Rev. Thomas Reese, a prolific U.S. Jesuit analyst of Vatican affairs, commented on the canonisations.""Francis's solution is brilliant ... since the men are so different, it does not canonise either model of being pope. It leaves him free to follow his own path.""John, who was born in Italy in 1881 and reigned from 1958 to 1963, is best remembered for convening the Council and promoting ""aggiornamento"" (updating) to open the Church to modern times.He died after the first of the Council's four sessions and did not witness its far-reaching changes - including the end of Latin at Mass, use of modern music and challenges to Vatican authority - that appealed to reformers but alienated those more at home with the traditional ways.Polish-born John Paul, pope from 1978 to 2005, upheld many Council reforms, but shifted the emphasis towards a more centralised Church, with clearer condemnations of wayward theologians and sexual freedom and a more assertive expression of Catholic identity in a strongly secularised world.That more conservative turn was amplified by his German successor Benedict XVI, pope from 2005 to 2013, who brought back an older liturgical style and readmitted ultra-traditionalists who reject the Council and were excommunicated by John Paul.In addition to debates over the Council, the scandal of clerical sexual abuse of children hangs over the last two pontificates, creating additional fault lines within the Church. TWINNING POPESTwinning papal candidates for sainthood has developed in recent decades as canonisations, which once were less frequent and less visible to the world's Catholics, have become events immediately broadcast around the globe.""It goes back to Pope Paul VI,"" said church historian Massimo Faggioli, author of the new book John XXIII: The Medicine of Mercy, referring to the pontiff from 1963 to 1978.In 1963, following John's death, several cardinals asked his successor if the Vatican Council could declare the late pope a saint by acclamation, as was the custom in the early Church.Paul cautiously waited until the Council's end in 1965 and then started the procedures for beatification - the step before sainthood - for John and his conservative predecessor Pius XII.Pius's case bogged down in controversy over his role during the Holocaust, when critics said he ignored the fate of the Jews while defenders said he did all he could to save them.When in 2000 John Paul beatified John, he twinned him with Pius IX, the pope who convened the First Vatican Council in 1869-1870 but whose long papacy (1846-1878) was marred by reactionary politics and accusations of anti-Semitism.Pope Benedict put John Paul on the fast-track to beatification and canonisation and had Pius XII declared ""venerable,"" the step before beatification - two acts seen as underlining the conservative emphasis of his pontificate.""In 2010-2011, the rumour in Rome was that the couple (to be canonised) under Pope Benedict would be John Paul and Pius,"" said Faggioli.

21,FIFTY,11 Classic Hollywood Kisses That Will Send Shivers Down Your Spine,Shelley Emling,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/best-movie-kisses_n_5161663.html,,2014-04-25,"Clark Gable (1901 - 1960) and Vivien Leigh (1913 - 1967) star in the MGM romantic drama 'Gone with the Wind', 1939. (Photo by Clarence Sinclair Bull/John Kobal Foundation/Hulton Archive/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb669c3250000320039a1f7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"What's your favorite on-screen kiss of all time? Was it Elizabeth Taylor and Montgomery Clift in ""A Place in the Sun""? Or perhaps Audrey Hepburn and George Peppard in ""Breakfast at Tiffany's""? Even in this day of one high-tech special effect after another, a passionate kiss in a movie -- if done right -- has the power to send shivers down our spines like nothing else. We asked our Facebook friends about the best on-screen kisses of all time and received a wide variety of responses. ""Sammy Davis Jr. laying one on Archie Bunker!!"" said Randy Derflinger. ""I loved the spliced together kissing scenes in 'Cinema Paradiso',"" said Vincent Aurelius. We agree. And here's what a few others had to say. Have anything to add? Let us know in comments.1. Jimmy Stewart and Donna Reed in ""It's a Wonderful Life."" George Bailey may have had big plans in this 1946 comedy-drama, but they all fell by the wayside after he fell in love with Mary. The pair's on-screen kiss, which comes after the two are forced to lean in close to share a phone, is the result of undeniable pent-up sexual tension.2. Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh in ""Gone With the Wind."" After Scarlett says ""You're a fool, Rhett Butler. When you know I shall always love another man,"" Rhett grabs her and says ""Stop it. You hear me Scarlett, stop it. No more of that talk."" The kiss that followed makes this 1939 classic worth re-watching again and again. Swoon.  3. Burt Lancaster and Deborah Kerr in ""From Here to Eternity."" With the surge of the ocean's tide washing over them, the adulterous kiss shared by the two stars in this 1953 wartime drama was pretty torrid stuff. And audiences loved it.  4. Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman in ""Casablanca."" The star-crossed lovers in this 1942 favorite can't ever seem to get it together. Even so, we absolutely melted when Ilsa finally confessed her love for Rick, followed by one of the most passionate kisses ever.5. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams in ""The Notebook."" Released in 2004, this movie may not be a decades-old classic. And yet the scene in the rain in which Noah says ""It wasn't over. It still isn't over"" was cited by many of our readers as their absolute favorite on-screen kiss. We can see why. Their kiss was SO talked about the pair even re-enacted it at the MTV Awards.  6. Robert Redford and Barbra Streisand in ""The Way We Were."" They may have played mismatched lovers in this 1973 hit, but the chemistry between the outspoken activist and the golden boy was undeniable.  7. Richard Gere and Debra Winger in ""An Officer and a Gentleman."" After a boring day at the factory, what woman wouldn't want to be swept up in a handsome officer's arms, and kissed without a word? And with ""Up Where We Belong"" playing in the background?8. Richard Gere (yes, again) and Julia Roberts in ""Pretty Woman."" Julia Roberts played a prostitute named Vivian in this 1990 classic -- a prostitute who said she wouldn't kiss on the mouth. And that's why when she did finally kiss Richard Gere's character Edward, it was pure magic.9. Tobey Maquire and Kirsten Dunst in ""Spiderman."" Although not the most conventional of kisses, who could ever forget the upside down kiss these two stars shared in this 2002 blockbuster?10. Don Murray and Marilyn Monroe in ""Bus Stop."" After Don Murray character Beau leaves his ranch in Montana in order to take part in the Phoenix rodeo, he falls in love with a saloon singer played by Marilyn Monroe. After she realizes she's fallen in love with him too, the kiss that follows ""takes your breath away"" as one of our Facebook friends recalled.11. Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet in ""Titanic."" Jack and Rose are the lovers on this doomed ship. But before all hell breaks loose, he takes her to the very tip of the bow. With her arms outstretched and her eyes closed, Rose says ""I'm flying!"" Jack wraps his arms around her and they kiss. Beautiful.  "

Here's my non-traditional ""training"" for my first More Magazine / Fitness Magazine Women's Half Marathon on Sunday, April 13, 2014 in Central Park, where 6,844 women crossed the finish line:Monday, March 3 I register online for the More/Fitness Women's Half Marathon, which included $40 to sign up as a new member of NYRR (New York Road Runners) and $80 for the race.Sunday, March 30 I play doubles tennis and then power walk a bridge with my BFF and her white poodle.Wednesday, April 9 Touchdown LGA! My JetBlue lands in NYC, so I'm much closer to the dreaded run, which I really have not properly trained for...Thursday, April 10 Zumba class with fab instructor Kelly Bragdon, who whips us into shape with salsa and merengue dance steps, is filled with high energy and smiles to the beat of Gloria Estefan's Conga and Latino tunes. At the New York Sports Club, I saw the small poster of the More Half... yikes, it's in three days!Friday, April 11 After taking the #1 subway from midtown to 18th Street, I walk over to the Metropolitan Pavilion, where the More/Fitness Health & Wellness Expo will attract thousands of ladies who are runners, fitness divas and runner wanna-bes. I pick up my bib with my number -- I'm official now! Then I meander by all sorts of cool exhibits: Skechers sneakers, Athleta purple ponytail holders and Duane Reade's trail mix and bandage give-aways. Upstairs for my runner's shirt, I say to the male athlete (who was accumulating volunteer hours to qualify for the NYC Marathon) that perhaps next year they could order extra-small sizes. He smiled and offered a petite deep fuchsia T-shirt (after all, ""radiant orchid"" is the color for 2014!). Because I was at the expo early enough to snag one of the few extra small shirts, I became a happy camper.Saturday, April 12 In Chinatown, I treat my three Columbia civil engineering students to dim sum at Golden Unicorn. I've been mentoring these college students on their resumes, interviews and summer jobs. The Vietnamese student just landed a structural engineering summer internship in Singapore, so I made him practice using chopsticks during dim sum... Other runners are gobbling down pasta, while I'm snarfing down spinach and shrimp dumplings, fish balls and steamed pork buns.Back at the New York Sports Club (the ""kick asphalt"" sponsor of the More/Fitness Half Marathon), I take an afternoon Zumba class. The substitute instructor is Marcella Walker -- an even more muscular Gabby Douglas (not more toned, just more mature). For More Magazine readers, we women over 30 can appreciate a dynamic, fit Zumba leader; Marcella asked us our choice for the last dance routine: ""Moves Like Jagger"" or ""Happy."" We were already grooving by the time she started Pharrell Williams' hit, ""Happy""! Upon leaving the gym, I shared with my fave NYSC membership consultant Desiree Warner at the West 80th location that I was attempting my first half-marathon the next day! She was high-fiving me in delight!Stocking up for my breakfast before the race, I walk across Broadway to discover Birdbath Green Bakery. I buy the humongous muffin, an old-fashioned, pull-apart pastry with apples, raisins, walnuts and cinnamon. Then I zip into Zabar's to buy the large freshly squeezed orange juice. A day without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.That evening -- the dinner before my first More Half -- I meet my gal pals at Mont Blanc in the theater district and try veal marsala -- not the typical staple on a runner's diet, but simply my craving.Sunday, April 13 Up at 5:50 a.m., I shower and inhale my flavorful Baker's muffin, along with a banana, then savor my fresh OJ. I inscribe my emergency contact info on the back of my runner's bib and then secure it on my More/Fitness fuchsia T-shirt with four shiny safety pins. Waiting on the subway platform, I strike up a conversation with a Canadian guy who is signed up for an Ironman Half -- that's a half triathlon. So my riding the subway and then walking to Central Park is a much easier prelude to a half marathon then his three-part race.I walk alone and meet my first running pal crossing Central Park West. Bedazzled in her orange and black, Liz just defended her Ph.D. at Princeton, so this half marathon should be a piece of cake for her! Then an excited young Asian Katie -- dressed warmly in her dark blue Columbia hoodie -- runs up to me because she recognized me! We were at the same Columbia banquet a few nights ago, except she was one of the younger females (Columbia College 2013) while I was one of the older ladies. As a More Magazine occasional reader, I realize that I am twice her age and we are both running in the same half marathon...Then I meet Aura (a young attorney from Puerto Rico) and her beau Andres (who's studying for his LLM at Columbia Law); he became our fun paparazzi before we headed to our places for the 8 a.m. half marathon.At the start of the race, a pixie athlete befriends me. I ask for her advice because this is my first crack at a really long race -- struggling with the notion of power walking or running every other mile. Rose, with inverted French braids woven across the sides of her reddish hair, politely said: ""Listen to your body."" Words I later cherished throughout my Central Park tour. I comment on her cool gray Skechers shirt, and Rose enthusiastically shared that she was on the Skechers running team. Skechers -- one of the More/Fitness Women's Half Marathon presenting sponsors has a Performance Division of running shoes, she taught me. When Hoda Kotb (from NBC's Today) announced the morning greetings to thousands of female runners, Rose and I got pumped for the race!  The scenic path of looping around Central Park twice became exhilarating to me. Passing such landmarks like Guggenheim Museum and Metropolitan Museum of Art on the East Side, then American Museum of Natural History on the West Side was breathtaking. Never thought I would encounter three Zambonis on the racecourse. Alas, Lasker Rink, which is being converted to its summertime pool soon, is spotted as I round off the hills in Harlem. Running from Columbus Circle area to near Malcom X Boulevard is already a feat for me.One of the official NYRR volunteers cheering us on at the steepest incline in the way Upper West portion of Central Park kept shouting ""It's a hill -- get over it!"" He chanted that numerous times, and I cherished his fanatic support even more my second time around. Twelve hills on this course!!""More cowbell!"" I would exclaim, every time I passed a spectator clanging his/her bell. The weather was 58°; the spring flowers were blooming; and I kept myself hydrated throughout the path of plentiful water stations.Having never run over five miles in my life (also because I did not train for this tough course), I sprinted the last few yards and crossed the finish line at 3 hours and 29 seconds, which is now my personal best! We had a time limit of four hours, so I made it. My pace of 13:47 per mile equates to running over 10 miles and power walking, combined with a few side stops of stretching my legs, the rest of the way. ""Half marathon"" sounds simpler than 13.1 miles!Finish line: ""Bedazzle me!"" I shouted to the band of medal holders. One gentleman placed the red and blue ribbon with silver medallion over my head, and I felt like an Olympic champion. That was my first running medal, and then soon I am greeted with the best-tasting NYC bagel ever.Athleta -- another major sponsor for the More/Fitness Women's Half Marathon -- offered free massages after the race at its West 70th & Columbus Avenue boutique of trendy athletic wear. I had never heard of this store until this race. Athleta provided a smorgasbord of food (including mimosas) at the front door, and I was the first registrant for the much-needed free massage.
