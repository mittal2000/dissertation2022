0,COLLEGE,White House's Pick For Tackling Sexual Assault Has Some Problems Of Its Own,Tyler Kingkade,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/johns-hopkins-sexual-assault-white-house_n_5310690.html,,2014-05-15,"Ayers Saint Gross, an architecture firm, redesigned the Johns Hopkins University campus in Baltimore, Maryland, by converting asphalt to brick, making signs uniform and putting parking underground and to the edges. (Kim Hairston/Baltimore Sun/MCT via Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bae4e8b240000310096603e.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Johns Hopkins University, one of three institutions the White House recently claimed would ""lead by example"" in reforming the way schools address cases of sexual assault, has joined a list of other elite schools accused of mishandling such cases. JHU currently faces a federal Clery complaint for not disclosing an alleged gang rape at the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity, or PIKE. As first reported this month by The Huffington Post, multiple university officials knew Baltimore police were investigating an alleged gang rape at PIKE in March 2013, but decided against notifying the campus community. PIKE continued to hold parties, and almost a year after the alleged assault, a stabbing at one such party resulted in the fraternity being put on probation. A subsequent university investigation is ongoing, and may ultimately result in the chapter's expulsion. News of the complaint came just as the White House task force on campus sexual assault named JHU's School of Nursing responsible for researching sexual violence on campus and for determining rates of rape in off-campus residences. The nod from the White House, which also assigned responsibilities to the University of New Hampshire and the University of Texas at Austin School of Social Work, attracted favorable coverage, including headlines saying that Hopkins ""lead[s] the way in combating sexual assault.""But the investigation into PIKE doesn't mark the first time students have raised questions about Johns Hopkins' compliance with the Clery Act, the law that requires schools to track and disclose all reports of sexual assault on campus.In March 2011, the blog Until It's Zero began encouraging survivors to share stories about their experiences at JHU, with the intent of demonstrating that the university's official count of zero rapes between 2007 and 2009 was inaccurate. (The latest JHU Clery report shows eight forcible sex offense reports in 2012, one in 2011 and zero in 2010.) Students related stories of being brushed off by campus police, or hesitating to report their assaults for fear that no one would believe them.Around the same time, during the 2010-11 academic year, the Hopkins student newspaper drew outrage for a pair of opinion pieces, one of which referred to women as ""bison"" and ""elephants"" and one of which debated the pros and cons of hooking up while drunk. The latter article included a passage arguing that intoxication provides women with a ""convenient excuse to be promiscuous and not be considered slutty by society's biased standards."" The editors of the paper later apologized for the former article and said that it was meant to be read as satire.A 2010 graduate of Johns Hopkins who spoke to The Huffington Post anonymously said that she saw shades of recent history at the school this month, as students protested on campus in favor of increased transparency on sexual assault cases.At a frat party in early 2009, a man tried to stick his hand under her dress, the former student told HuffPost. ""I slapped him across the face, I told him not to do it and told my friends it was time to go,"" she recalled.As she attempted to leave, the woman told HuffPost, the man came at her with his hands up, yelling ""If you ever fucking grab me again,"" before someone intervened and pushed him away. The JHU alum says she reported the incident to the university, and a dean said they would speak with the man who assaulted her. As far as the former student knows, no punishment came of the incident. Later that summer, the same woman said, she began receiving threats online from another woman at the school. She was hesitant to return once summer break was over, but her father told her, ""It's Johns Hopkins, nothing's going to happen.""In the fall, the woman says she was jumped in a campus stairwell by the woman who had made threats against her. She reported it quickly to the university, but because there was no security camera footage, and her attacker allegedly had marks from the student's attempt to defend herself, school officials said they couldn't punish the woman. The student asked if the university could at least guarantee her safety, she told HuffPost. School officials told her no, they could not. ""I know this girl was threatening me and she attacked me in the stairwell and she's walking around without any fear, and I'm fearing my life because this girl dragged me down a marble staircase,"" the former student told HuffPost. She added that she had never been in a fight before, and that she ""wouldn't think the first time it would happen would be at Johns Hopkins.""The former student said that she decided that fall to move off-campus, because she was still being harassed by friends of her frat-party assailant and friends of the woman who assaulted her. She ended up living with an aunt nearly an hour away and commuting to school. The former student declined to specify exactly where the groping incident took place, fearing further retaliation, but said it was not at a party hosted by PIKE. After HuffPost's story on the federal Clery complaint filed against Johns Hopkins, the student said she began thinking ""about how I could've handled it different. I didn't know that was something you could do -- that I could file a complaint.""JHU spokesman Dennis O'Shea said the university takes sexual violence seriously, and is ""committed to the safety and security of our students."" He also noted that the university is undergoing an independent review of both JHU's response to the March 2013 incident and the complaint filed with the Department of Education.""Pending completion of that review, it would be inappropriate to comment on the universityâ€™s handling of sexual misconduct reports,"" O'Shea said. ""We cannot, because of our obligations under federal law to maintain confidentiality and the privacy interests of those involved, provide information about specific cases.""A decision about whether PIKE will be allowed to remain at the university is expected as early as this week. Last month, JHU announced it will be hiring Terry Martinez as the new dean of students, bringing her over from Columbia University, where she currently serves as interim dean of student affairs. Columbia is also facing a federal complaint over the alleged mishandling of multiple sexual assault cases."
1,BUSINESS,3 Things Orgs Can Learn From How History's Biggest Thinkers Spent Their Days,"Crystal Kadakia, ContributorTwo-Time TEDx Speaker and Modern Workplace and Millennial Expe...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/3-things-orgs-can-learn-f_b_5311495.html,"We often benchmark companies to learn best practices, but in people management, we rarely benchmark our practices by looking at high-performing individuals.",2014-05-15,2014-05-12-article01CB0E6E800000578265_470x410300x261.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-05-12-article01CB0E6E800000578265_470x410300x261-thumb.jpg,"When you think about strategies that make your workforce productive and innovative, how granular have you gotten? We often benchmark companies to learn best practices, but in people management, we rarely benchmark our practices by looking at high-performing individuals. Recently, a few different designers have taken infographics to a new level by reviewing how geniuses historically have spent their day.From the Daily Mail:Using Mason Currey's book Daily Rituals: How Artists Work -- which draws on diaries and letters from the thinkers themselves -- designer RJ Andrews has mapped out the comings and goings of some of history's most important figures, right down to the hour.Each circle represents the 24 hours in a day with the topmost point representing midnight and the bottom point representing noon. The colors represent different activities.So what can we learn from these geniuses with regards to our organizations?Walking Whether scientists, musicians, or writers, the majority of geniuses spent some amount of their day walking. Charles Darwin even took three walks per day, spread evenly throughout.Some of the top Fortune 500 companies took a note from these geniuses and create environments that encourage taking breaks outside, to help rejuvenate employees but also to encourage connection.Consider the environment DreamWorks Animation has created, with an extensive campus of outdoor walkways, fountains, and courtyards. Not so coincidentally, they also happen to have a 97 percent retention rate and a revenue of near $150 million. ""Many times true innovation, true original ideas, don't happen in a conference room or in someone's office,"" says Dan Satterthwaite, head of human resources at DreamWorks. ""They happen in hallways, they happen outside. It's the function of people running into each other that was really thought through in the layout of the campus.""The risk with the next generation is if we don't create this kind of environment, we will get into a habit of staying in front of our screens. When it comes down to it, we won't know what to do or how to spend our time if we didn't have virtual connection.Reading Geniuses spent a significant block of time every day staying informed, but also thinking deeply on what they've read. Today when we consider the amount of information we have to process, no longer only in print form, we have to consider a different strategy to stay informed and comprehend the information. Tools like Clearly by Evernote can be very helpful. Clearly is a browser add-in that in one click removes the ads and distractions on webpages and shows you only the article you intend to read.Focused Time The majority of geniuses spend long blocks of time in an environment where they can focus on ideation, creation, meditation, and sometimes connecting/interviewing with people.Open layouts may be the trend currently, but, as many Millennials will tell you, having a choice between collaboration areas and focused work areas is really the best way to be productive.The Journal of Environmental Psychology reports, ""Open-plan layouts are widely acknowledged to be more disruptive due to uncontrollable noise and loss of privacy.""Consider today the amount of physical and digital noise we all must filter through to focus and concentrate. Reflection rooms, meditations rooms, and quiet workspaces are a must to help employees disconnect, reflect and come back ready to innovate and problem solve.Another great culture building idea is Benjamin Franklin's habit of waking up with ""What good shall I do today?"" and ending with ""What good have I done today?"" Creating a culture where groups share what their goals are at the beginning of the day and what they accomplished by the end of the day can be a really great way to boost productivity and recognition at the same time. Consider adding this to your internal social networking strategy.What would your map look like? I wonder how many of our maps would be based around unproductive screen time.What we can learn from geniuses ultimately is that getting inspiration comes from activity, not the inactive, digital comas we tend to drown in today.What can you do to empower your organization to spend their time and ultimately, make contributions like history's biggest thinkers have?All images used with permission courtesy of RJ Andrews.

2,WOMEN,Colorism and the Most Beautiful Woman,"Dr. Carmen Cruz and Michelle Prudhomme-Coleman, Contributors",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/colorism-and-the-most-beautiful-woman_b_5292488.html,"This is still a complex issue.

(Photo by Raymond Hall/GC Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/60bdff96270000741a1ff9a8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In the United States today, more than 3 out of 10 women are women of color, and by 2050, women of color will be a majority of women in the country.So why are we still so startled to see ourselves on the cover of magazines?Take Lupita Nyong'o, the actress of Kenyan heritage, recently named the world's most beautiful person by People magazine.Lupita being on the cover is progress, but we have a long way to go. The celebration of her beauty doesn't erase colorism, the same way the election of President Obama didn't eliminate racism.When have various white women been compared for their differing skin tones?As diversity specialists and as women of color, we have to acknowledge that young women of color in the U.S. still face so many obstacles, particularly painful experiences around skin tone, identity and self-image.Colorism is a real thing. It is defined as prejudiced attitudes or prejudiced treatment of people based on the relative lightness or darkness of their skin in comparison to others of the same race.Recently, there has been more national attention to the concept of colorism. A documentary, Dark Girls, got rave reviews by women of color. The film reminds us that we see and judge color and this plays a part in how we view the ideal standard of beauty. In addition, Oprah just had a Life Class about this phenomenon. There also are the classic doll studies dating back to the 1940s and a recent study in 2010 with children showing a preference for light-skinned dolls.Colorism affects a person to the point where a dislike or even hatred towards the self develops.This process is called interrnalized colorism. It's a similar process to internalized racism. Both spectrums are discriminated against -- lighter-skinned women toward darker-skinned women and darker-skinned women toward lighter-skinned women. How are women NOT going to internalize these negative, colorist messages when women of their own race are saying it against them? Perhaps even a mother to a daughter, a sister to a sister? There used to be a time when people felt safe with people who look like them. As an adult Black woman, I (Michelle) remember being told by a close relative that I was ""a different kind of pretty"" in comparison to my sister, who is lighter than me. Those words still resonate with me to this day. As a lighter-skinned, caramel colored Cuban woman, I (Carmen) have experienced other women of color tell me I am ""not dark enough"" to identify as an ethnic minority. That type of within group discrimination can sometimes be even more hurtful and potent.  This is still a complex issue. One person, one experience, like seeing Lupita on a cover, cannot undo hundreds of years of an internalized issue. Just like anything else, it is going to take time.How do we translate a message from a magazine to a young girl of color in the classroom on beauty and perceived standards? We can't do that when whiteness is valued around the world as a blueprint for standard beauty. It's a process. Young women of color continue to face much adversity in every day life. We need to be conscious and consistent about creating and encouraging images where girls and women of various races and ethnicities feel seen, acknowledged, validated and valued for their cultural attributes.   Perhaps Lupita being selected as People's most beautiful person shows us that there is a possibility in getting there. Being considered the ""most beautiful"" is not really at all about making the cover of a magazine. It is about being secure in being your authentic self.

3,WOMEN,There's a Larger Dialogue on Gender That Has Gone Missing,"Gina Reiss-Wilchins, ContributorCEO, ZanaAfrica Foundation",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/theres-a-larger-dialogue-on-gender_b_5298744.html,What is happening to these young women is nothing new. They are victimized because they are girls. This happens every day all over the world.,2014-05-15,2014-05-09-10265534_10151997299412391_4532460718253515106_o.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-05-09-10265534_10151997299412391_4532460718253515106_o-thumb.jpg,"""I abducted your girls. There is a market for selling humans. I will sell them,"" said Abubkar Shekau, the leader of the Boko Haram Islamist militant group claiming responsibility for kidnapping nearly 300 schoolgirls April 15, 2014. Two hundred and seventy-six of those girls are still missing, and most may never be recovered. Boko Haram roughly translates to ""Western education is a sin.""The government of President Goodluck Jonathan -- now that it had succeeded in passing legislation making gay relationships punishable by 14 years imprisonment -- had hoped to pivot world attention to its new, suddenly mushrooming economy, now Africa's largest.It's response to the kidnappings was slow and ineffective. Until the brave parents of these girls took matters into their own hands, publicly protesting -- and in some cases going into the bush alone to find them -- the incident went almost unnoticed.What is happening to these young women is nothing new. They are victimized because they are girls. This happens every day all over the world. The institutions that ought to protect them not only fail to do so, but instead ignore them or else actively support their victimization. Simply put, it is their gender that increases their vulnerability to crimes this monstrous. Particularly in countries like Nigeria, where corruption and cultural norms oppressive to women are in place, it is not surprising that these young girls (ages 12 -15) have been used as bargaining chips and targeted for violence.  Girls lack power and are victimized. But it's more than that, too. As with trafficking, it shows the degree to which young girls have become commodities -- often reduced to nothing more than the value their bodies hold in a male-centric marketplace. Selling humans for sex remains and immensely profitable global industry. Shekau's insistence that girls -- who were allegedly taken because they dared to attend classes -- should forgo education is telling. In the marketplace for their bodies, rather than their minds or skills, education actually reduces their value rather than enhances it. A wife or sex slave who knows more than you do is not an asset -- she is an affront, an embarrassment, a potential complication. In any case, he has succeeded in deeply embarrassing the Nigerian government of President Goodluck Jonathan. And it is not as if Shekau only attacks girls. Only weeks ago, his troops allegedly attacked and then slaughtered over 40 young men -- some burned alive. But they were killed, not abducted, raped and sold -- because they had no value as sexual commodities. Moreover, news of these horrors -- the abduction of Nigerian schoolgirls or the slaughtering of young men -- was overlooked and under-reported. Instead, daily reports on the long-missing MH370 airliner were at the top of the hour for months. Rather than reporting on the fact that innocent children had been abducted or tortured to their deaths, the international news media and the American government were remiss. Yet finally, after three long weeks, the United States government has finally declared that it will help find these young women. It is the right move, but hard to determine if they will succeed. Many of the girls may already be across the border in Cameroon and Chad.It is worth noting that Al Queda -- with whom he is allied as a fellow Muslim militant -- has backed away from Shekau's violence towards these girls. When even Al Queda thinks you've gone too far in your barbarity towards young women, you've crossed some kind of boundary. But there's a larger dialogue on gender that has gone missing. The world needs to pay more attention and do more to ensure that the subject of gender is woven into the fabric of how we discuss these issues. Part of that lies in supporting girls' education and empowerment. By encouraging women young and old, to speak up and speak out, we can fight against the extreme forces that seek to silence them. #BringBackOurGirls."
4,SCIENCE,Facial Features Just May Affect Women's Odds Of A Political Win,Macrina Cooper-White,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/female-politicians-success-facial-features_n_5318207.html,,2014-05-15,Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton celebrate women's achievements at a March luncheon at the Capitol.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baebfb624000032005503ac.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"As more female politicians vie for seats in Congress and the one in the Oval Office, it's increasingly clear that factors unrelated to their political views affect their chances of getting elected -- from what they wear to whether they shed a tear during emotional moments.And those may not be the only essentially superficial attributes that matter. A provocative new study links female politicians' facial features with their success or failure on election day -- and it's bad news for women with masculine-looking faces.""A female politician's success was related to how feminine or masculine her face was perceived less than one half-second after its initial exposure, suggesting that the way a face's gender is rapidly processed may translate into real-world political outcomes,"" study co-author Dr. Jon Freeman, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, said in a written statement.For the study, 300 men and women were asked to view photos of the faces of 198 male and female politicians (winners and losers in Senate and gubernatorial elections between 1998 and 2010) and move a computer mouse to quickly identify them as male or female. The speed and trajectory of each mouse movement were recorded using specialized software designed just for such studies.What did the researchers find? The more participants' cursors veered slightly toward the ""male"" button when evaluating a woman's face -- suggesting that the face had more masculine features -- the less likely she was to have been elected. Simply put, female politicians with feminine faces are more likely to win elections. For both male and female candidates, it also mattered how competent or attractive they looked. The more attractive or competent a candidate appeared to be, the more likely the candidate was to have won, which is consistent with previous research. But controlling for these factors, the researchers say the effect of feminine facial features on female politicians' electoral success was still distinct. The participants based their perceptions of a face's gender on both ""biologically driven cues"" (jaw shape, brow line, and lip size) and ""socially driven cues"" like hair and make-up, according to the scientists.Intriguingly, for male politicians, no link was found between how masculine or feminine their faces were perceived to be and their electoral success. ""Our findings are consistent with previous research showing that there is a discrepancy in how male and female politicians are evaluated, but what is surprising about our results is that there is a discrepancy in how male and female politicians are evaluated even at the level of their facial features,"" Freeman told The Huffington Post in an email.And this discrepancy was even more apparent in conservative states, Freeman said. When he and his colleagues looked at the level of conservatism in the states where politicians were running, they found that the effect of feminine facial features on female politicians' success became more pronounced in the more conservative states. This may help explain a 2012 study that found that Republican congresswomen had more stereotypically feminine faces than their Democrat counterparts. Conservatives may have ""a relatively rigid cognitive style and an emphasis on traditional gender roles"" that leads them to vote for female politicians with a traditionally feminine appearance, Dr. Eric Hehman, a postdoctoral researcher in Freeman's lab, said in the statement. So what's a woman politician to do? Grow her hair long and wear more make-up? ""Itâ€™s far too early to suggest female politicians ought to change their campaigns or styles of self-presentation, and much more research is needed to understand the nuances of our findings,"" Freeman said in the email. ""That said, the results suggest a discrepancy in how male and female politicians are evaluated and a possible impediment to the success of female politicians in the U.S.""The study was published May 15 in the journal Social Psychological and Personality Science."

The test omitted to mention the broader context of the author's Nazi past.The case has caused embarrassment and anger in Austria, which was annexed by Nazi Germany into the Third Reich in 1938 and has been struggling for decades to escape a reputation for brushing its history under the carpet.Salzburg educator Wolfgang Muehlbacher, part of a group of critical authors who exposed the incident, said a 15-member advisory panel of literature experts who picked the text had clearly missed its significance.""I assume the people simply were not exact enough, took too little time for this so that they did not see what was going on,"" he said. ""Former Nazis who were involved in this whole machinery of crime have to read the text as absolving them.""Hausmann died in 1986.Education Minister Gabriele Heinisch-Hosek said the co-directors of the independent BIFIE institute in charge of overseeing educational quality and testing would go in July.She convened an advisory panel to report back in a month on how the Alpine Republic can avoid such mishaps in future under a new leadership of the BIFIE.The case has also raised renewed concerns that Austria's education system - while praised for its effective vocational training - is failing to equip young people with the academic skills they need to thrive in the modern world.Unemployment is the lowest in the European Union but organizations including the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development group of wealthy countries have highlighted issues with Austrian schools.""Austria's well-being model has largely drawn on the quality of its vocational education system, but the education system as a whole faces important challenges,"" the OECD found in its latest national survey of Austria.It noted the proportion of students below minimum proficiency levels in international tests had risen while the share of those reaching the highest proficiency had fallen.Heinisch-Hosek promised a shake-up of BIFIE to ensure ""less heads in the clouds and more feet firmly on the ground, less ivory tower and more suitability for practical use"".
