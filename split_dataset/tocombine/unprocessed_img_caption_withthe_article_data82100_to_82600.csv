1,POLITICS,Ben Carson Doesn't Understand Black Lives Matter,Marina Fang,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ben-carson-black-lives-matter_us_55be740ce4b0d4f33a0327fa,"""Of course all lives matter.""",2015-08-02,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7e4ec1d00003000143032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson on Sunday expressed skepticism over the purpose of the Black Lives Matter movement and refused to acknowledge that he made a mistake when calling the movement “silly.”Last week, the neurosurgeon-turned-GOP presidential candidate said that Black Lives Matter is “silly” and “divisive.”“We need to talk about what the real issues are and not get caught up in silliness like this matters or that matters,” he said. “Of course all lives matter. I don’t want to get into it. It’s so silly.”On Sunday, Carson denied that he called the movement itself “silly” and clarified that he thinks the distinction between “black lives matter” and “all lives matter” is “political correctness going amuck.” “Well, you know, I don't recall calling it silly, but what I called silly is political correctness going amuck. That's what's silly. When, you know, I guess it was Martin O'Malley who said, you know, ‘Black lives matter, white lives matter.’ He got in trouble for that and had to apologize. That's what I'm talking about is silly,” Carson said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”He was referring to an incident last month when Democratic presidential candidate Martin O’Malley ignited controversy after he told Black Lives Matters protesters: “Black lives matter. White lives matter. All lives matter.”Carson added: “Of course all lives matter, and of course we should be very concerned about what's going on, particularly in our inner cities. It's a crime, you know, for a young black man, the most likely cause of death is homicide. That is a huge problem that we need to address in a very serious way.”When host Chuck Todd reminded Carson that saying “all lives matter” diminishes the fact that blacks as a group are disproportionately targeted and mistreated by police, Carson suggested that people place too much blame on the police:I think we need to look at the whole picture. One of the things that I always like to point out to people is how about we just remove the police for 24 hours. Can you imagine the chaos that would ensue? And the vast majority of police are very good people. Are there bad apples? Of course.The Black Lives Matter movement has tried to bring racial discrimination and police brutality into the forefront of the presidential race. But with the exception of Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has sponsored criminal justice reform legislation in the Senate, the GOP presidential field has been largely silent on the problem of racial inequality. Those who have weighed in have appeared dismissive of the movement.Like Carson, fellow GOP contender Jeb Bush also believes that O’Malley did not need to apologize for his remarks, telling reporters last month that “we're so uptight and so politically correct. Now you apologize for saying lives matter?""Carson and Bush were the only Republican candidates to speak at last week’s National Urban League conference, an annual gathering of civil rights leaders. In their speeches, both candidates failed to directly address the concerns of the Black Lives Matter movement, shifting the focus away from specific issues like criminal justice reform to more general thoughts about race. Bush discussed his efforts to promote more black leaders when he was governor of Florida, while Carson recounted a childhood incident of racism.Watch Carson’s comments in the clip above.

2,SPORTS,Ronda Rousey Defeats Bethe Correia By Knockout In 34 Seconds,Peter Andrew Hart,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ronda-rousey-defeats-bethe-correia-by-knockout-in-34-seconds_us_55bd62c4e4b0d4f33a031532,"The star fighter extended her jaw-dropping record with a knockout right punch, ending the fight in the first round.",2015-08-02,"<p>Ronda Rousey of the United States punches Bethe Correia of Brazil in their UFC women's bantamweight championship bout during the UFC 190 event inside HSBC Arena on August 1, 2015 in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.</p>",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55bdb6df1400002e002e1a7c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"34 seconds and good night. That was all the time it took for UFC star Ronda Rousey to knockout Brazilian opponent Bethe C0rreia in the highly-anticipated UFC 190 title fight. Rousey is now another step closer to a perfect career, after claiming her sixth UFC title.As the American ace is wont to do, she dispatched the trash-talking Correia (9-1) in the first round. But in a departure from her norm, Rousey finished her with punches, rather than her signature armbar.It was a Rousey right that hit the lights for Correia.  The women’s bantamweight title bout was the main event during Saturday’s event in Rio de Janeiro, and Rousey's first fight outside of the U.S. Packing a heavy quiver of advantages, the heavily-favorited American handed Correia her first loss in stunning fashion. Rousey moved in fast, landing several punches, and then some uppercuts, driving Correia into the cage. Then came the right.""Instead of forcing a clinch, I planned to overwhelm her striking first so she would want to clinch,"" Rousey said after the fight. ""And that's exactly what happened.""As if Rousey's 12-0 career record wasn't impressive enough, the ferocity of her fighting lays to rest any question of why she is the UFC's biggest star. All but one of her 12 fights ended in the first round, and nine lasted less than a minute. She took down Alexis Davis in 16 seconds, and in February defeated Cat Zingano by submission in 14 seconds in addition to the 34 needed to knockout Correia. She is stronger, bigger, quicker, and next to deadly if she breaks out her signature armbar when the fight goes to the mat. But she didn't even need the armbar Saturday.  Correia, 32, is by no means a fighter without her own merits. She earned the shot at the title by beating two of Rousey's training partners, Jessamyn Duke and Shayna Baszler. Nicknamed ""Pitbull,"" Correia is an aggressive boxer known for her striking strength. But she hasn't shown as much skill grappling and when fighting off her feet. On Saturday, those deficits kept her from making it past the first round.Rousey, 28, roared into the bout in Brazil, fueled for battle after Correia appeared to reference Rousey's father's suicide during a spat of trash-talk. Rousey was seeing red. ""Here's pretty much the plan: I'm going to beat up Bethe,"" she said. Purposefully chosing to have the fight in Correia's backyard, she claimed she would ""embarrass"" the Brazilian.Hours after the death of Hall of Fame wrestler ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper, Rousey dedicated her fight to the man who gave her the same nickname. ""This one's for you Roddy..."" she posted on Instagram.Rousey delivered on her promise in Rio.Another title to her name is sure to only brighter Rousey's star. A 2008 Olympic bronze medalist in judo, she has become a pop icon, showing up on magazine covers, television shows and movies. Rousey advocates for women to confront issues with body image, while brushing aside comments that she looks too ""masculine."" Unbeaten in the cage and with a personality of gold, she won the “Best Fighter” award at the ESPYS. Holding the trophy, she took a jab at fellow fighter and known domestic abuser Floyd Mayweather Jr., after he slighted her by saying he didn't know of her.""I wonder how Floyd feels being beat by a woman for once; I’d like to see him pretend to not know who I am now,"" Rousey said.In addition to the main card Rousey-Correia fight, UFC 190 featured renowned Brazilian fighters Mauricio ""Shogun"" Rua and Antonio Rogerio Nogueira, along with other bouts.

Fahmy, who was sentenced last year to up to 10 years in prison, has sued his Qatari employer for $100 million, his lawyers said, claiming the satellite network was negligent and supported blacklisted Islamists. AFP PHOTO / KHALED DESOUKI (Photo credit should read KHALED DESOUKI/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc156b7260000350070abe7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Amal Clooney Counsel for Mohamed FahmyMohamed Fahmy, the Canadian journalist who worked with Al Jazeera, must wait another excruciating month to find out if he faces a new prison term in Cairo. The verdict in the Al Jazeera retrial has been postponed twice this week, most recently this morning until Aug. 29. It has not escaped observers that this new date falls after the visit of U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, as well as the planned celebrations of the new Suez Canal waterway scheduled for Aug. 6, with various world leaders in attendance. The verdict may be coming later; but the world will still be watching.Last year, Fahmy and other journalists working for the Al Jazeera English news network were sentenced to between seven and 10 years' imprisonment for broadcasting ""false news"" harmful to Egypt's image; supporting the Muslim Brotherhood terrorist group; and lacking a license for certain communications equipment in their possession. Fahmy spent over a year in prison before his conviction was set aside by Egypt's Supreme Court in January. Since then he has been retried while on bail. But Fahmy was supposed to be home in Canada long ago. Back in February his colleague Peter Greste, an Australian national, was freed under a new decree allowing foreign nationals accused or convicted of crimes to be sent home. At that time the Egyptian authorities had told Fahmy and Canadian officials that he, too, would be deported through the same procedure if he renounced his Egyptian citizenship. The renunciation was published through official channels in preparation for his release. But in the days that followed Greste's departure, the Egyptians made an inexplicable U-turn. Fahmy was not deported, and on Feb. 12 he was dragged back to court to face a lengthy new trial. The unfairness of the original trial  is well-documented. It was famously presided over by a judge known as the ""executioner"" whose verdict was that the journalists ""were joined by the devil to exploit [their] profession ... to harm this country."" The retrial has been no fairer. The prosecutor sought to argue that simply because they worked for Al Jazeera and carried the video editing software Final Cut Pro, the journalists should be convicted on all charges. But there was no evidence to show that the journalists were in any way linked to the Brotherhood or had ever falsified content. Egypt's own Supreme Court had ruled that the original conviction for terrorism was unjust because there was not even an allegation (let alone proof) of violent intent, and in the retrial the prosecutor did not present anything new. On the false news charge, even the court's own experts concluded that there was no evidence of any fabrication or manipulation of footage. Nor is there a basis to sustain a conviction for the ""crime"" of possessing a telephone and two broadcasting devices without a license.The long-awaited verdict on Aug. 29 will reveal whether the new panel of judges is independent and fair. In a case where even Egypt's Supreme Court (and the Supreme Court prosecutor) have admitted that there is no evidence to support the charges, the only just conclusion that can be reached by the judges is a full acquittal. But if the judges fail to acquit, President Sisi must promptly intervene to rectify this injustice. Sisi has previously distanced himself from the case, and promised to pardon  the journalists if they are re-convicted. He rejected calls to intervene while the retrial was pending, but it will be over when the verdict is announced.Last month, the Canadian ambassador to Egypt -- Troy Lulashnyk -- and I sent joint letters to the Egyptian president, minister of justice, foreign minister and prosecutor-general seeking Fahmy's release. We also requested joint meetings in which we could discuss the actions to be taken by the government in the event of a guilty verdict. We will be seeking confirmation of these meetings in the next week. And in the meetings we will seek an assurance that President Sisi will deliver on his promises to pardon the journalists if any guilty verdict is announced, or else deport Fahmy to Canada as previously agreed. This outcome should also be pressed by the international community. The U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry has previously called the trial of the journalists ""deeply disturbing,"" ""chilling"" and ""draconian,"" and the UN has stated that their conviction was ""in breach of international human rights law."" If the court delivers another guilty verdict, the U.S., UN and other key international actors should urge Sisi to immediately step in.According to Reporters Without Borders, Egypt had the fourth highest number of journalists imprisoned worldwide in 2014, the country's worst record since reporting began in 1990. This show trial is a simple example of political score-settling between Egypt and Qatar, which funds Al Jazeera, at the journalists' expense. Other journalists in Egypt have been given life sentences or held for years in prison without charge. President Sisi should know that the world will be watching the court's verdict on Aug. 29, and his government's response to it. Media freedom in the region is at stake. And, as the Council of Europe has put it, ""it will be the commitment shown to free speech which determines whether or not Egypt grows -- or shrinks [--] in the eyes of the world.""

The eurozone's top official says it's not easy to find a way to get Greece a short-term cash infusion that will help it meet upcoming debt repayments. (AP Photo/Emilio Morenatti)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc156b7240000d30b51bc8b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hardly was the ink dry after the agreement July 17 between Greece and its creditors before columnists, commentators, economists and politicians jumped to far reaching conclusions: Greece would never make it. Leaving the Euro (Grexit) is certain. This is the beginning of the end for the Eurozone. Germany is bullying the other members of the Eurozone and by throwing its weight around dooming the whole European edifice to collapse. The engine driving European integration since 1952 -- the Franco-German axis -- has come to an abrupt end primarily because of German policies. What have been written so far reminds of the fairy tale Alice in Wonderland with the Queen of Hearts saying ""sentence first, verdict afterwards."" Why not opt for common sense and wait until signs indicating the effect of the measures are available? Over the next 6-12 months, we will know more about the performance or non-performance of the Greek economy, more about the political reverberations among other things because of the coming election in Spain, and have a clue of the Franco-German relationship not the least reading how they tackle challenges such as the British request for new terms of EU-membership and the unstable situation in Ukraine. We will also have a better basis for prognoses concerning public opinion, attitude of politicians and economic policy of the Eurozone.The Greek economy is weak, definitely, but at the end of 2014 the growth rate was respectable and surpluses on the primary public budget and current account pointed to a better future. It is not a spring chicken, but the effort to turn the economy around may not be insurmountable. When the dust settles the Greeks are going to live in a much more competitive economy than they were used to. Do they adjust exploiting the opportunity auguring a new beginning or do they fall back on the behavioral pattern seen over decades locking the country and its economy into a failed state? Only the Greek people can give the answer. Often overlooked is the plain fact that the destiny of nations rests with the people -- Greece is no exception.The chorus predicting continued contraction and inevitably Grexit is deplorable exactly at the moment when the most intricate challenges since the overthrow of military dictatorship in1974 lurks around the corner. Membership of the European Union (1980) was designed to cement democracy after the colonels were dismissed. Euro membership connoted confidence in the Greek people's right to be a European nation contributing to stability inside Greece and in the Eastern Mediterranean and south of the Balkans.Is it wise to cast doubt over these indisputable beneficial political objectives for Greece and the rest of Europe by coming out with all guns blazing telling the Greeks that whatever they do future membership of the Euro is out and future membership of the European Union in question? Greece outside the Euro and -- at best -- a second rate member of the European Union can easily turn into something very nasty judged by its history over the last two hundred years.It is open for discussion how wisely creditors behaved. Certainly! And the Greek government, too! But this is irrelevant. We cannot go back to the future. The agreement - -good, bad, lousy, or promising -- is what Greece and the creditors have. No one with the slightest experience of being in office can seriously contemplate going back to the negotiating table. This is it or nothing.So why not give it a chance?Joergen Oerstroem Moeller is visiting senior research fellow at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, Singapore. adjunct professor at Singapore Management University & Copenhagen Business School, and honorary alumnus at the University of Copenhagen."

About 1,700 feet.That's how high Camp David, the official presidential retreat, sits in the relatively cool Catoctin Mountains, 62 miles from the White House. Maybe -- more on that later.How many times has President Barack Obama retreated there? 38. His mountain stays there have spanned all or part of 91 days -- including his overnight stay Saturday with some old high school and college friends in town to celebrate the president's 54th birthday this coming week.Obama and high school buddies from Hawaii played golf at Joint Base Andrews down in the staggeringly humid Beltway realm of a summer weekend in Washington Saturday before heading up to ""camp'' with some college and Chicago friends. The president and retinue came down from the mountain today. Obama's a virtual stranger, though, in comparison with his predecessor. George W. Bush paid 126 visits to Camp David at a similar point in his presidency, spanning all or part of almost 400 days there. By the end of his eight years in office, he'd made 150 trips up the mountain, on all or part of 491 days. The undisputed, sole authority on presidential days away from the Oval Office is Mark Knoller, a CBS News White House correspondent who keeps a tally. He offers some numbers that beg the question of how many days the ex-commander-in-chief actually spent in Washington -- wait until we walk through the Crawford, Texas, ranch count. Or for that matter, Obama's coming summer vacation on Martha's Vineyard this month and annual winter holidays in Hawaii. More on that later as well.It doesn't take a world leader to find the cool respite the Maryland mountains offer -- while many have since the first foreign visitor, Winston Churchill, helped Franklin Roosevelt plan the Allied invasion of Normandy there. It's summertime, and escaping's easy -- a good 10 degrees cooler in the Catoctins little more than an hour from Washington. Camp David may be off-limits to the public, but miles of trails with panoramic views and geological treasures are free for all. All it takes is a pair of light hiking boots to climb the first ascent to Hog Rock, an overlook 1,600 feet above sea level today that once rested at the bottom of an ancient ocean. Making one's way to the sheer wall of a 500-million year-old outcropping of volcanic quartzite that is Wolf Rock, hidden within the hardwood forest, the exposed rock of another era holds a hiker in awe of its dark crevices. Roosevelt was the first to stake a claim to a presidential retreat here, in the eastern-most region of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The camp itself was born of the New Deal. The Works Progress Administration and Civilian Conservation Corps opened a recreational area in the Catoctin Mountains. One part, Camp Hi-Catoctin, was finished in the winter of 1938-39 as a family camp for federal employees. Roosevelt, in search of a resort close to the capital at the onset of World War II, visited Hi-Catoctin on April 22, 1942. He commissioned a main lodge on the 125-acre site resembling his winter vacation home in Warm Springs, Georgia. He named it USS Shangri-La -- as the presidential yacht, USS Potomac, was mothballed due to the security concerns of a nation at war.The camp was kept going after the war, as Harry Truman carved a national park out of the surrounding mountains. Truman spent little time there, however -- his wife, Bess, was said to find the place sort of dull.Dwight Eisenhower renamed it Camp David, after his grandson, sparing generations of presidents to follow the embarrassment of spending as much time as Bush, for instance, spent at a place named for the fictional mountain kingdom in James Hilton's 1933 novel, ""Lost Horizon."" Eisenhower, a former Supreme Allied Commander of European forces, made an oil painting of a cottage at the camp.John Kennedy and family shot skeet there and rode horseback. Lyndon Johnson consulted with advisers about the war in Vietnam. Richard Nixon had several more buildings erected and conducted Cabinet meetings and family gatherings. Gerald Ford even found use for it in the wintertime: snowmobiling. Margaret Thatcher slept there during Ronald Reagan's time. And Bush's father, George H.W. Bush, pitched horseshoes and hosted Prince Charles.If military actions have been plotted here, so has peace. In 1978, Jimmy Carter kept Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat at the compound with a swimming pool, putting greens and skeet-shooting range for nearly two weeks. They emerged with the framework for a Middle East peace accord, albeit transitory. Bill Clinton made another run at Camp David peace talks with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat. They ended without a deal.Obama may have logged 38 visits during six-plus years as president, by Knoller's count. But his recent reception for leaders of six Gulf states -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, in May -- marked only the second time he has hosted world leaders there. The previous time was May 2012, an overnight stay for leaders of the world's top industrialized nations, known as the Group of Eight. (See the photo). Not only was Bush a far frequent camper: During 19 of his 150 trips to Camp David, he hosted foreign leaders, Knoller notes. British Prime Minister Tony Blair made the trip three times. Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan went, as did President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy, President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan and Russian President Vladimir Putin.Bush had leaders down to his Crawford ranch in Texas, too -- 19 times. During his eight years in office, he made 77 ranch visits (spanning all or part of 490 days), by Knoller's expert count.But Bush dropped another recreational relief -- golf -- as the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were escalating. He played just 24 rounds of golf as president, Knoller has noted -- his last round on Columbus Day, Oct. 13, 2003. He explained that it was unseemly for a president to play that way when Americans were at war.The wars have wound down since then, and Obama has taken to the greens in earnest, playing more than 230 rounds of golf as president. These outings are largely reserved for friends and aides, though, notably free of any other political leaders. If Bush had his own remote Texas ranch for longer retreats, Obama has rented vacation homes on the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans for winter and summer breaks. By Knoller's count, Obama has spent all or part of 73 days during seven trips to his birthplace of Hawaii on annual Christmas holidays with his family and all or part of 42 days during six summer trips to Martha's Vineyard. Still none of these places are open to the public the way much of Catoctin Mountain Park is. The ridge rising upwards of 1,800 feet owes its origins to a fault that broke about 200 millions ago, during the Triassic Period. As the land rose to the west of what is now U.S. Route 15, it slid to form the Frederick Valley. The glaciers of the Ice Age never reached this place, the National Park Service notes, but prolonged freezes and thaws fractured the rocks there. All this activity left a treasure trove of quartzite in the southeastern corner of the park -- that hardest of all rocks in all he formations there holding the highest grounds and vista-points. The most dramatic of views opens to a hiker at the ledge known as Chimney Rock for its precarious pile of Weverton quartzite. At 1,419 feet in elevation, Chimney Rock is not the highest. Hog Rock, much closer to Camp David, reveals another valley panorama at 1,600 feet. Yet, without any view beyond the surrounding woods, Wolf Rock offers the most dramatic resting point. It's a 500-million year old ridge of greenstone riven with deep crevices carved by freezing water that seeped through metamorphosed basalt lava flows. The surface of this 2,000-foot thick pile of quartzite and feldspar sparkles purple, green and pink in the late afternoon sunlight.As for Camp David itself, various accounts put its perch at 1,700 or 1,800 feet. The Catoctin Mountain Park office says no official elevation is available publicly.As any dignitary who has landed at Camp David aboard the first chopper, Marine One, or any average hiker who has made his way around the rocks, knows, it's hard to convey the effect any mountaintop view has on one's psyche. Sitting atop a high, prehistoric rock with nothing else in mind erases all other thoughts, focusing the eye on one transfixing image. Which, after all, is the point of getting away from it all.""We have reason. It is the entire meaning and purpose of Shangri-La.''  -- James Hilton, ""Lost Horizon""(Photo of President Obama at Camp David hosting 2012 G8 Summit by Mikhail Klimentyev/AFP/Getty Images)"

Yet as enthusiasm for the bombastic billionaire and the socialist senior continues to build within each party, the political establishment is mystified.They don't understand that the biggest political phenomenon in America today is a revolt against the ""ruling class"" of insiders that have dominated Washington for more than three decades.In two very different ways, Trump and Sanders are agents of this revolt. I'll explain the two ways in a moment. Don't confuse this for the public's typical attraction to candidates posing as political outsiders who'll clean up the mess, even when they're really insiders who contributed to the mess.What's new is the degree of anger now focused on those who have had power over our economic and political system since the start of the 1980s.Included are presidents and congressional leaders from both parties, along with their retinues of policy advisors, political strategists, and spin-doctors.Most have remained in Washington even when not in power, as lobbyists, campaign consultants, go-to lawyers, financial bundlers, and power brokers.The other half of the ruling class comprises the corporate executives, Wall Street chiefs, and multi-millionaires who have assisted and enabled these political leaders -- and for whom the politicians have provided political favors in return.America has long had a ruling class but the public was willing to tolerate it during the three decades after World War II, when prosperity was widely shared and when the Soviet Union posed a palpable threat. Then, the ruling class seemed benevolent and wise. Yet in the last three decades -- when almost all the nation's economic gains have gone to the top while the wages of most people have gone nowhere -- the ruling class has seemed pad its own pockets at the expense of the rest of America.We've witnessed self-dealing on a monumental scale -- starting with the junk-bond takeovers of the 1980s, followed by the Savings and Loan crisis, the corporate scandals of the early 2000s (Enron, Adelphia, Global Crossing, Tyco, Worldcom), and culminating in the near meltdown of Wall Street in 2008 and the taxpayer-financed bailout. Along the way, millions of Americans lost their jobs their savings, and their homes.Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has opened the floodgates to big money in politics wider than ever. Taxes have been cut on top incomes, tax loopholes widened, government debt has grown, public services have been cut. And not a single Wall Street executive has gone to jail.The game seems rigged -- riddled with abuses of power, crony capitalism, and corporate welfare.In 2001, a Gallup poll found 77 percent of Americans satisfied with opportunities to get ahead by working hard and 22 percent dissatisfied. By 2014, only 54 percent were satisfied and 45 percent dissatisfied.The resulting fury at ruling class has taken two quite different forms.On the right are the wreckers. The Tea Party, which emerged soon after the Wall Street bailout, has been intent on stopping government in its tracks and overthrowing a ruling class it sees as rotten to the core.Its Republican protégés in Congress and state legislatures have attacked the Republican establishment. And they've wielded the wrecking balls of government shutdowns, threats to default on public debt, gerrymandering, voter suppression through strict ID laws, and outright appeals to racism.Donald Trump is their human wrecking ball. The more outrageous his rants and putdowns of other politicians, the more popular he becomes among this segment of the public that's thrilled by a bombastic, racist, billionaire who sticks it to the ruling class.On the left are the rebuilders. The Occupy movement, which also emerged from the Wall Street bailout, was intent on displacing the ruling class and rebuilding our political-economic system from the ground up.Occupy didn't last but it put inequality on map. And the sentiments that fueled Occupy are still boiling. Bernie Sanders personifies them. The more he advocates a fundamental retooling of our economy and democracy in favor of average working people, the more popular he becomes among those who no longer trust the ruling class to bring about necessary change. Yet despite the growing revolt against the ruling class, it seems likely that the nominees in 2016 will be Jeb Bush and Hillary Clinton. After all, the ruling class still controls America.But the revolt against the ruling class won't end with the 2016 election, regardless. Which means the ruling class will have to change the way it rules America. Or it won't rule too much longer.ROBERT B.

Yet, as Americans have grieved and raged against the killing of Cecil, many have not put that same energy and empathy into grieving and raging against the slaughter of African Americans in the U.S., especially by police. I have found the use of #CatLivesMatter hashtag to be especially tone deaf on race and human life. The #BlackLivesMatter hashtag and movement comes from a specific racial context of struggle and should not, in my view, be appropriated for a different purpose, even if that purpose is one with which I agree. I find, in teaching liberation theology, that contextual analysis is the most difficult subject for people to understand, especially those who have not experienced direct social oppression themselves (of gender, sexual orientation, race, class etc.). Contextual analysis is, as Mary Potter Engel and I write in Lift Every Voice: Constructing Christian Theology from the Underside about the specifics of your social location and the function of the power of economics, culture, history, religion and politics on shaping that location. This kind of analysis influences liberation theological work profoundly. That does not mean, however, that only the oppressed can do theology. Critical consciousness about social location can be developed, especially through scrutiny of all these social and religious factors. This would include power abuses in the human as well as the non-human world. Thus, there can be a connection among different justice issues in a deep contextual analysis of the abuse of power in dominant Western culture and the murderous display of such power in killing.  Why kill a beautiful (and endangered), protected animal? Some call it a sport, though one only the very wealthy can pursue. Instead, I believe this hunting of ""big game"" is a show of power, demonstrating the ability of wealth to destroy a very large animal and in so doing, triumph over it. But it is critical to see that the killing of human beings is also very often an abuse of power, the ultimate demonstration that you and your dominant race are supreme.The Roman Empire was extremely influential in the formation of Western culture and this carries through even today. Imperial Rome demonstrated its power in gladiatorial games by killing thousands and thousands of wild animals, many of them captured from Africa, to demonstrate their ultimate authority. But the Romans were also expert at killing human beings. The Roman games involved brutally cruel public performance of violence on subjugated human bodies such as criminals, slaves, captives of war, and Christians. As I have written before Christians were subject to torture, as one martyr put it, 'as if we no longer existed.'"" One thing the Roman Empire knew well was power and how to symbolize it as total domination over life and death. Killing huge numbers of human beings as well as a wide variety of wild animals in the Roman games was that symbol. The Emperor Trajan, to celebrate his conquest of Dacia (roughly modern Roumania), gave games in AD 108-9 lasting 123 days in which 9,138 gladiators fought and eleven thousand animals were slain. Killing to demonstrate imperial control was a Roman specialty and the Romans passed it on into dominant Western culture, especially through the influence of the Roman Empire on the formation of Christianity as an institutionalized religion post the ""peace"" of Constantine. The Euro-Atlantic slave trade and subsequent exploitation in American slavery as the foundation of American wealth finds precedent in the Roman model of trading in human lives for profit, and in the early church there was protest against this. In Revelation 18, the vision of future justice includes the ""merchants of the earth"" mourning for rapacious Rome, because no one buys their ""cargo of gold, silver, jewels, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk... and slaves, that is, human souls."" And in the Middle Passage and in American slavery, as well as in lynching and now police killings, literally millions of human souls of African origin have suffered and died. In the same month as the Cecil the Lion killing came to light, University of Cincinnati Police Officer Ray Tensing was indicted for shooting and killing unarmed motorist, Samuel DuBose. County Prosecutor Joe Deters, after viewing the video of the incident, called the shooting ""senseless"" and ""horrible."" To me, viewing the video released, it looked more like an execution. That is why #BlackLivesMatter matters so much, because the life of Samuel DuBose seems to be another exercise in the abuse of white police power over African American lives. Many Americans may be able to more easily see why an American dentist going to Africa and paying to kill a protected lion is cruel and wrong. After all, there are no questions about Cecil's intentions or background. Cecil seems ""innocent"" as animals are construed to be. But African Americans today seem cast as the dangerous ""other"" by law enforcement, guilty and even sentenced to death before any court can consider the circumstances.  This is why contextual analysis matters so much. Many Americans have yet to get the point that executing an unarmed African American is shockingly wrong. Ask yourself, why would the killing of Cecil appall so many Americans and yet the killing of Samuel DuBose offend comparatively fewer at least based on the social media churn? The reason is, frankly, that many Americans have not examined the whole context of racial injustice in this country. Killing is the ultimate abuse of power. And it has a long history in Western religion and culture, and can certainly be seen in the wanton killing of animals. But it must especially be seen in the summary killing of human beings. This is not a zero sum game, where either you care about killing of animals and driving them to extinction for ""sport,"" or you care about the killing of unarmed African Americans as an egregious abuse of police power.   You need to care about why your culture values death as the ultimate performance of the abuse of power. You need to engage changing that with specific contextual analysis, because if you don't, you will just be engaging in sentimentalism instead helping to create deep and complex change."

In her reply on Twitter, Schumer referenced the victims and said she was preparing to do something:21-year-old Mayci Breaux and 33-year-old Jillian Johnson were killed and nine others were injured July 23 by John Russell Houser, 59, who also killed himself during the incident.Clements called Schumer ""our generation’s epitome of what it means to be a strong, powerful, self-aware champion for the experiences and truths of being a woman,"" and highlighted the particular challenges women face in pushing for gun control.""The hatred and trolling of women fighting for gun reform is specifically twisted to become gendered threats and attacks. They reference rape, 'setting us in our place,' obeying men and shutting us up, and overall they simply exemplify the worst of a patriarchy obsessed with the symbol and purpose of guns,"" she wrote on Medium. Clements also noted that women in the United States are much more likely to be killed by a person with a gun than are women in other high income countries and that women of color are disproportionately affected by gun violence.After the shooting, Schumer tweeted that her heart was broken and her thoughts were with the victims of the attack. Earlier this year, she released a mock advertisement for birth control, advertising how difficult it was to obtain for women while guns remained relatively easy to get.But Clements said that she knew Schumer could do more.""Be a voice for our generation and for women — two groups who make up most of the victims of the gun violence in our country,"" Clements wrote. ""As you said and as I’ve learned, what truly matters in life is how you decide to write your own story. And in doing so, don’t apologize to the frightened millions who resent that they never had it in them to do it. Instead, show them it can be done."""
