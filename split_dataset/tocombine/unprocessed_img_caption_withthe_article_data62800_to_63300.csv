And due to positive response from students, the library has already ordered three more. If they’re used, Shaffer believes the library can squeeze in an additional six bikes, making it an even dozen. The library is also planning to add six elliptical machines that can go under desks or tables as well.“For now [the machines] are first come first serve,” Shaffer said. “If riots break out, we will develop a reserve system.”Shaffer heard about exercise bikes that allow students to study two months ago when he stumbled upon FitDesk, the company that makes them. The bikes were reasonably priced, which meant it would be easy to buy a few and see how they were received.“I also thought that the idea fit nicely into Troy University's motto ‘Educate the mind to think, the heart to feel and the body to act,’” he said.Shaffer hopes the bikes help students learn to embrace balance in their lives, noting:“It is important to study, but while you are developing your mind, you also have to keep your body in shape.”Spoken like a true educator."
1,ARTS & CULTURE,Historical Fiction Gets No Respect -- Here's Why It Should,Claire Fallon,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/katy-simpson-smith-interview_us_56d9a846e4b0ffe6f8e909e8,"Katy Simpson Smith, author of the new novel 'Free Men,' on the joys and frustrations of exploring the past.",2016-03-07,Author Katy Simpson Smith's second novel is based on a true story of a shocking murder in Alabama not long after the Revolutionary War.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56d9ae7a1e0000950070f485.jpeg?cache=jjYZgekwvg&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"When Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall and other novels about Thomas Cromwell became surprise international bestsellers several years back, it wasn't their length or literary aspirations that made the books' popularity surprising to commentators: It was the subject matter.James Wood, The New Yorker's finicky fiction reviewer, deemed Mantel's books good despite being ""historical novels, a somewhat gimcrack genre not exactly jammed with greatness."" In The Nation, Leo Robson noted, "" Historical fiction has become a byword for middlebrow wasteland."" His piece proposed that two white female British authors, Mantel and Penelope Fitzgerald, could be credited with saving the reputation of historical fiction nearly singlehandedly. In a profile of Mantel in The New Yorker, Larissa MacFarquhar observed that ""these days the historical novel is not quite respectable. It has difficulty distinguishing itself from its easy sister the historical romance. It is thought to involve irritating ways of talking, or excessive descriptions of clothes.""Ouch.For authors who aren't Mantel, pursuing historical fiction can be a ding to their reputation, stamping them as mediocre or less interested in literary accomplishment than playing in a historical sandbox. Author Katy Simpson Smith, whose second novel, Free Men, was published last month, told The Huffington Post in an email that she's definitely noticed this stigma. ""I'm not sure why,"" she added, ""since so much of our great literature is about the past.""Free Men is the second historical novel from Smith, who holds not only an MFA in creative writing, but a PhD in history. Like her first novel, The Story of Land and Sea, Free Men takes place in the post-Revolutionary coastal South, which Smith studied academically, and examines the stew of social disorder, racial oppression, and shifting alliances that defined the nascent American region.Also like her first novel, Free Men marries exhaustive research into the time period with effortless prose and insight into her characters that makes a story from several centuries ago feel immediate. In Smith's full email conversation with HuffPost, she shared more about her process for writing a historical novel, her new book, and her frustration with the stigma attached to historical fiction. Free Men is your second historical novel set in the post-Revolutionary South, and you also studied the period academically. What compels you to focus on this era and region?I'm fascinated by the early stages of this country -- shouldn't we all be wondering how we got this way, for better or worse? -- and the South is such a perfect crucible of developing ideas on race and class and gender. Marginalization here was increasingly the order of the day, and I've found myself obsessed with figuring out how those on the edges of power fought back. Free Men is based on an actual historical event. How did you stumble across the story? What made you feel drawn to turn it into a novel?I was researching a very different story when I found myself knee-deep in the geography of south Alabama, wondering how on earth a place called Murder Creek got its name. Turns out it's exactly how you'd think! There's a great 19th-century history of Alabama that includes descriptions of the culprits (a white man, a black man, and an Indian man), and I thought that unlikely trio was begging to be unpacked. Was taking on the voices of such a diverse cast of characters, including a Native American and black slaves, daunting? How did you approach trying to make sure their stories and voices were resonant and truthful?Absolutely -- as a writer, you can never walk into someone else's head without a certain terror. But I also knew that a story about the early South without black and Native voices was even more irresponsible, so I was going to try my darnedest. Which meant: combining as much knowledge about their historical context as possible with an unwavering empathy and an awareness of my own cultural blind spots. And, of course, this turns out to be the same basic recipe for writing any character. You have degrees in both creative writing and history -- when did you know you'd write historical fiction?I was writing historical fiction as early as middle school (I had a story, e.g., about a girl my age growing up in a medieval Welsh castle -- because why not!), but as I got older I think I veered toward history as the most rational way to indulge my love of stories. But there's a big dream in all of us that's struggling to find its way out, and for me, that was fiction writing. Have you ever written fiction in a contemporary setting, or would you ever?I have written a few contemporary short stories but felt out of my element, weirdly. I don't consider myself solely a historical novelist, though, so I will happily go wherever the stories take me! How do you balance making your fiction feel fluid and natural with adhering to the historical accuracy? Do you ever find this to be a struggle?It is indeed tough, and one's initial impulse as a historian is to Get the Facts Right, but there's a larger purpose in fiction, and I've had to teach myself that those factual details are just handmaidens to the story. I want this world to be fully and clearly eighteenth-century, but I want its reach and relevance to be much broader than that. What is your approach to research? Do you do lots of research specifically for a novel, research as you go, or try to immerse yourself more generally in the time period instead of doing focused research?I've been fortunate that my first two novels have sprung from the same period as my academic research, so I have a foundational knowledge of this world on which to build. But I invariably run into all sorts of things I don't know (How do you steer a sailing ship? What birds sing in the Alabama woods in March?), and it's fun to take breaks from the writing to go down those research paths. If I tried to do all the research at the beginning, I'd still be at it! It's good to know one's weaknesses. Do you have any advice for aspiring historical novelists?Again, I'd say: put the story first. It's the story that will burrow into the hearts of readers, not the petticoats. Do the research, but then feel free to put most of what you learned in a separate folder, only to be pulled out when readers ask about your research process. Historical fiction isn't exactly a clear-cut genre as sci-fi, romance, or fantasy are, though it does tend to cross over here and there (historical romance, for example, is a huge subgenre). Do you ever feel that historical fiction carries a stigma compared to literary fiction with a more contemporary focus?YES. And I'm not sure why, since so much of our great literature is about the past. Is a human 100 years ago worth less than a human today? Does a story set 100 years ago need to be more brilliant than a story set today, just to claim the adjective ""literary""? Is it considered a ""genre"" because most contemporary readers are only interested in what's around them? And isn't that narrow, given that literature should be a project of horizon-expanding? You can tell I've thought a lot about this, and have reached no conclusions. Are there any other writers of fiction set in the past you particularly admire or enjoy?There are so many who do it well -- my personal pantheon includes Edward P. Jones, Charles Johnson, Toni Morrison, Peter Carey, Michael Ondaatje, Hilary Mantel -- but I've recently gotten excited about poets who are taking up the work of marrying imagination and history, especially in the South: Natasha Trethewey, Nikky Finney, Derrick Harriell. You've also published nonfiction historical research before; do you ever plan to write history again in the future?I don't have plans to write a straightforward history again, only because fiction is so deeply satisfying to me right now. Have you started working on another book, or thinking about one? If so, could you share anything about your next subject?I have! I'm in the early stages, so I'm entirely lacking confidence, but if it ever sees the light of day, it'll be a parable of Rome, with blood and guts and love and faith. "
2,POLITICS,Republican Voters Aren't Too Happy With Their Party Right Now,Ariel Edwards-Levy,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/gop-voters-unhappy-poll_us_56ddd5f9e4b03a405679643d,A new poll shows they see the GOP as more divided than ever.,2016-03-07,Notably fewer Republicans think there's a great choice among these guys.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=crop_99_247_4996_2913%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Republicans who don't support Donald Trump's presidential candidacy are horrified by his status as the GOP front-runner. Those who do support him are deeply mistrustful of the party establishment. The result? One increasingly unhappy party, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll.This past October, Republican voters were bearish about their current elected officials and the future of the GOP, but overwhelmingly enthusiastic about their presidential candidates. In that poll, 80 percent pronounced themselves at least satisfied with the Republican primary field, surpassing the percentage of Democrats who said the same.Since then, GOP morale has fallen substantially. While a majority still feel positively about their field of candidates, that percentage is down to 56 percent. Just 41 percent feel positively about the future of the party, and just 30 percent feel satisfied with their current officeholders. Only 11 percent believe the party is more united than it is divided.That doesn't necessarily spell electoral trouble for the GOP. Fewer than 1 in 10 Republican primary voters say they'd opt for the Democratic candidate in the general election, regardless of who wins their party's nomination.Republicans' views do, however, contrast sharply with opinions among Democratic voters, who remain largely optimistic about their party's future. Democrats' satisfaction with their presidential candidates has ticked up modestly since October. They're now 15 points more likely than Republican voters to be satisfied with their choices, instead of 14 points less likely to feel that way.About three-quarters of Democrats continue to say they feel positively about their current elected officials and the future of the party, which most generally see as united.Republicans have been deeply unhappy with their party for some time now, but until recently, much of that anger was focused on Washington, and on a Congress seen as both insufficiently conservative and capable of accomplishing nothing. Against that backdrop, GOP voters' enthusiasm for their 2016 field looked like a notable bright spot for the party. Now that's looking less and less like the case.The HuffPost/YouGov poll consisted of 1,000 completed interviews conducted March 2-4 among U.S. adults, using a sample selected from YouGov's opt-in online panel to match the demographics and other characteristics of the adult U.S. population.The Huffington Post has teamed up with YouGov to conduct daily opinion polls.You can learn more about this project and take part in YouGov's nationally representative opinion polling.

","Ted Cruz is beginning to look like the viable alternative to Donald Trump. His gain is Marco Rubio's loss. And GOP voters are about equally willing to back any of the three. This is HuffPollster for Monday, March 7, 2016.CRUZ SURGES TO WINS AND NEAR-UPSETS ON SATURDAY - HuffPollster: ""Louisiana's Republican primary offered more drama than expected Saturday night, with Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) dramatically narrowing the margin after networks had already called the state for Donald Trump. One of the reasons: While Trump won handily among absentee ballots, which were the first to be tallied, Cruz surged among the votes actually cast on Election Day. The pattern isn't an entirely new one. In primaries this year, Trump has underperformed dramatically among late-deciding voters.. In Louisiana, though, the gulf between early and same-day voters is especially wide, and suggests a shift mostly from Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) to Cruz -- marking a change from Super Tuesday, when late deciders broke more evenly among the two….after a disappointing Super Tuesday for Rubio, Cruz is increasingly seen by GOP voters as the most viable alternative to Trump, with those undecided voters falling into place behind him."" [HuffPost] Rubio crashed and burned - Jonathan Bernstein: ""The biggest news on Saturday night was that Cruz, who won in Kansas and Maine and finished second to Trump in Louisiana and Kentucky, crushed Marco Rubio everywhere. As for Rubio, it was a drubbing that may prove difficult to recover from. He managed to beat John Kasich for third place in three of the four states and was expected to do well in Puerto Rico on Sunday. But it would appear he has lost conservative voters to Cruz and some moderates to Kasich, and has very little time to get them back. Kasich continued to hurt Rubio, but otherwise had little effect on the race…. If Rubio really is collapsing all over, maybe Kasich can surprise in Michigan on Tuesday. If he somehow combines that with victories in Ohio and Illinois the following week, he’ll be in the ballgame. That’s a whole lot of 'ifs.'"" [Bloomberg] Michigan looks to be a bigger challenge for Cruz - HuffPollster: ""After netting wins in Kansas and Maine Saturday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is facing longer odds in one of the next big states to vote, according to polls released Sunday. In NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist and CBS/YouGov polls of Michigan, which votes March 8, Cruz trails Donald Trump by 19 and 15 points, respectively. HuffPost Pollster's average, which includes all publicly available polling, shows him an average 19 points behind. Things could already be changing. Those surveys were both conducted before Saturday's elections, which saw Cruz surging dramatically among late-deciding voters, mostly at the expense of Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.). But the results also highlight a key difference between states like Michigan and many of the places Cruz has won so far….Cruz has pretty much relied on a conservative base to carry him to victory….Very conservative voters, though, make up a smaller faction in many of the upcoming primary races."" [HuffPost] TRUMP AND CRUZ LEAD IN DELEGATE COUNT - Philip Bump: “It's only the delegates that count. So Ted Cruz may have had the second-biggest margin of victory of the year in Kansas on Saturday, but he only netted the seventh-most delegates of any contest.So, setting aside the winners of states, who actually won on Saturday? On the Republican side, it appears to have been Cruz, whose victory in Maine and narrowing of the contest in Louisiana earned him the most delegates of any Republican. He went into the day trailing Trump by 98 delegates, according to early calculations from Real Clear Politics, and came out trailing him by only 84.” [WashPost]HUFFPOLLSTER VIA EMAIL! - You can receive this daily update every weekday morning via email!

That's all there is to it (and you can unsubscribe anytime).GOP VOTERS WOULD PROBABLY SUPPORT ANY NOMINEE - HuffPollster: ""Donald Trump's Republican presidential rivals have been vocal about his shortcomings….But, when pressed by a moderator at Thursday night's debate, they all pledged to support Trump should he become the party's nominee. GOP voters, new polling suggests, may end up coming to the same conclusion. Trump is unusually unpopular for a front-runner, FiveThirtyEight's Nate Silver points out. To date, exit polling indicates that just 49 percent of voters say they'd be satisfied to see him as the nominee. Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), though, each fare only slightly better. And Republicans are just as likely to say they would back Trump in a general election as they are to say they would support either Cruz or Rubio, according to a new HuffPost/YouGov poll conducted before Super Tuesday."" [HuffPost] Trump represents the views of Republican voters on issues better than Cruz or Rubio - Tobias Konitzer and David Rothschild: ""The GOP establishment is out of touch with its base. Trump actually represents Republicans better if you examine beliefs issue by issue….[O]nly 20 percent of the general population supports a complete abortion ban, even in cases of rape and incest – and only 25 percent of Republican voters do. Cruz and  Rubio advocate this position. Trump breaks with the GOP establishment – and agrees with the nearly 60 percent of Republicans who support the right to abortion in these circumstances….He breaks left to match Republican voters’ beliefs on abortion – and he breaks even further right to match those voters in his extreme positions on on opposing immigration and any pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. In other words, Trump’s apparent hodgepodge of moderate and conservative positions may actually make him a more representative Republican presidential candidate than the establishment candidates we’ve seen in the past eight years"" [WashPost] BERNIE SANDERS GAINS A FEW MORE WINS, WHILE CLINTON CONTINUES TO RACK UP DELEGATES - Amanda Terkel: ""Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) had a good night Saturday if you look at the number of states he won. He beat Hillary Clinton in the Kansas and Nebraska caucuses, while Clinton pulled out a win in the Louisiana primary. But Clinton actually came out ahead in the delegate count, with 55 delegates to Sanders' 47. And while Sanders has a good shot at winning the Maine caucuses on Sunday, he needs to start winning bigger -- and in bigger states -- to close the gap with her. Both Clinton and Sanders are already looking ahead not only to Michigan's primary on Tuesday, but the delegate-rich date of March 15, when Florida, Illinois, Missouri, North Carolina and Ohio will be holding their primaries. These states have diverse Democratic electorates, which bodes well for Clinton. She has done significantly better with communities of color, despite the fact that Sanders has been trying to make inroads.""

U.S. allies in particular usually don't want to be seen as meddling in domestic politics, mindful that they will have to work with whoever wins.Senior leaders in several countries -- including Britain, Mexico, France, and Canada -- have already made public comments criticizing Trump's positions. German Economy Minister Sigmar Gabriel branded him a threat to peace and prosperity in an interview published on Sunday.Trump's campaign did not respond to requests for comment on the private diplomatic complaints.Japan's embassy declined to comment. The Indian and South Korean embassies did not respond to requests for comment.A spokesperson for the Mexican government would not confirm any private complaints but noted that its top diplomat, Claudia Ruiz Massieu, said last week that Trump's policies and comments were ""ignorant and racist"" and that his plan to build a border wall to stop illegal immigration was ""absurd.""The foreign officials have been particularly disturbed by the anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim themes that the billionaire real estate mogul has pushed, according to the U.S. officials.European and Middle Eastern government representatives have expressed dismay to U.S. officials about anti-Muslim declarations by Trump that they say are being used in recruiting pitches by the Islamic State and other violent jihadist groups.On Dec. 7, Trump’s campaign issued a written statement saying that he was “calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on.”Trump subsequently said in television interviews that American Muslims traveling abroad would be allowed to return to the country, as would Muslim members of the U.S. military or Muslim athletes coming to compete in the United States.There are also concerns abroad that the United States would become more insular under Trump, who has pledged to tear up international trade agreements and push allies to take a bigger role in tackling Middle East conflicts.“European diplomats are constantly asking about Trump's rise with disbelief and, now, growing panic,"" said a senior NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity.""With the EU facing an existential crisis, there's more than the usual anxiety about the U.S. turning inward when Europe needs U.S. support more than ever.""Another of the senior U.S. officials said the complaints are coming mostly from mid-to-low rankingdiplomats – described as “working level” - rather than from the most senior officials.""The responses have ranged from amusement to befuddlement to curiosity,"" the official said. ""In some cases, we've heard expressions of alarm, but those have been more in response to the anti-immigrant and anti-refugee sentiment as well as the general sense of xenophobia.”More than a hundred Republican foreign policy veterans pledged this week to oppose Trump, saying in an open letter that his proposals would undermine U.S. security.""A LOT OF QUESTIONS""On Tuesday, General Philip Breedlove, the United States' top military commander in Europe, said that the U.S. elections were stirring concerns among America's allies.“I get a lot of questions from our European counterparts on our election process this time in general,"" said Breedlove, who did not mention Trump by name. ""And I think they see a very different sort of public discussion than they have in the past.”While not confirming the content of private diplomatic contacts, some foreign officials acknowledged their governments' concerns about Trump.A British official noted that in January, Prime Minister David Cameron said: ""What Donald Trump says is, in my view, not only wrong, but actually it makes the work we need to do to confront and defeat the extremists more difficult.""A Chinese official referred to a statement last week from China's foreign ministry spokeswoman. Asked whether China was concerned about Trump's proposal to place high tariffs on Chinese goods, Hua Chunyin declined to comment on specific candidates. But she said ""I want to stress"" that China and the United States have ""major responsibilities"" in maintaining international political and economic stability.Representatives of other countries publicly attacked by Trump, including Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Saudi Arabia, and Vietnam either had no comment or did not respond to requests for comments.Several American foreign policy experts said foreign diplomats have complained to them as well.""All foreign diplomats I’ve talked to are amazed at the Trump phenomenon and worried about it, especially in the Middle East and Europe,” said Elliott Abrams, senior fellow at the Council onForeign Relations think tank who handled Middle East affairs at the National Security Council from 2001 to 2009 under then-President George W. Bush.(Reporting by Mark Hosenball; additional reporting by Jonathan Landay, Phil Stewart, David Brunnstrom, and Emily Flitter; editing by Stuart Grudgings.)"

Shortly after the death of Justice Antonin Scalia last month, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) vowed to block any attempt by Obama to replace him. He and his caucus argue that the responsibility should be left to the next president -- hoping, of course, that a Republican will win the election. Lott said he ""would've handled it differently"" from the approach taken by McConnell, in an interview on CNN commentator David Axelrod's ""The Axe Files"" podcast released Monday. ""My attitude, particularly on the Supreme Court, was that elections do have consequences, sometimes bad, and I tried to lean towards being supportive of the President's nominees, Democrat or Republican,"" said Lott, who was majority leader from 1996-2001.He said Republicans were likely worried about the type of person Obama would nominate, since so many of his picks have been ""so bad and so far left."" ""Was it wise to jump out there the way the Leader did? You know, time will tell,""Lott added. Democrats are saying it was unwise, and they've already been hammering vulnerable Senate Republicans for their vow to obstruct. Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) is particularly caught in the crosshairs as he runs for reelection. He has said he won't hold a hearing for a potential Obama nominee, but he's been facing pressure at home, from his constituents.Lott also told Axelrod he believes Grassley could yet cave.""If the president comes up with somebody that's credible and is a little bit more mainstream or moderate, I wouldn't be surprised to see Chuck give him a hearing,"" he said.

The songstress, who acted as Simone in a 2003 musical performance, told The Hollywood Reporter during an interview about the film that she wasn't pleased with the way Simone was portrayed after seeing an early version of the film in 2013. She noted that the way filmmakers made Simone look in the film betrayed the late singer's true beauty. But Arie said the claim Saldana isn't ""black enough"" for the role is a ""messy"" way to frame a bigger issue. ""I think the best way to say it is that they casted her against type and went too far to make her fit,"" Arie said about the black and Hispanic actress. Arie first addressed the controversy in a letter to Simone's fan site in 2012 after images of Saldana in a darker face and fake nose surfaced. ""In my open letter I called it 'black(er) face,'"" she told THR. ""I didn’t know what to call it either. I have heard that there were black actors who played blackface, back when people did that. I think blackface was putting charcoal on your face and doing a certain type of act on stage, the shucking and jiving. You could be black or white. [The Nina portrayal] is a caricature. You had to put a whole other face on someone’s face.""Arie said she doesn't think Saldana ""did anything wrong,"" explaining she would've accepted the role if she was in Saldana's shoes. Saldana even said that she didn't think she was ""right for the part"" in a 2015 interview. Still, Arie said casting of the late singer was a lost opportunity. ""When you think about the way that we as human beings can inspire each other by being able to be our authentic selves, to deny someone who looks like Nina Simone the opportunity to play her is sad,"" Arie said. ""It would have been important and impactful had they made a movie about Nina Simone where the actress really looked like her. It would have changed someone’s life, I think."" Arie pointed out that a huge part of Simone's identity was how bold she was about her blackness at a time of great oppression.

10,POLITICS,How Newt Gingrich Conquered The Debates And What He'd Do About Donald Trump,Sam Stein and Jason Cherkis,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/newt-gingrich-trump_us_56dc649be4b0ffe6f8e9becf,Just call the former speaker Miles Davis.,2016-03-07,Gingrich credits the viability of his 2012 campaign to his success in the debates.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56dc65bc1e0000870070360b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"In this balkanized media landscape, presidential campaigns have placed a premium on creating viral moments. A simple tweet or Instagram post from Donald Trump can net a day's worth of coverage for minimal -- if any -- costs. But for Trump and other candidates, some of the best opportunities to create these moments has come from the seemingly countless number of televised debates. It was during the Republican debates that Trump was able to effectively vanquish former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, once the top establishment candidate. In what may turn out to be the most pivotal moment of the primaries, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie halted whatever momentum Florida Sen. Marco Rubio had by calling out his robotic responses to attacks.Debates can make or break candidates. And in the case of Newt Gingrich, who was a particularly strong debater, they can salvage a floundering campaign. As the former House speaker told the ""Candidate Confessional"" podcast: “The debates were clearly the key to my survival.""Gingrich certainly had to survive a lot. Shortly after he announced his run for the presidency in 2012, his campaign staff quit en masse over philosophical differences and his decision to take a cruise of the Greek islands instead of begging for votes at an Iowa rotary club. ""We took a huge detour, ran into a brick wall and fell into a swamp,"" Gingrich said of his campaign launch. But over the course of the fall of 2011 and winter of 2012, Gingrich gradually climbed back up in the polls. And he briefly overtook Mitt Romney, winning a resounding victory in the South Carolina primary on the strength of his theatrical debate performances.On the podcast, Gingrich offered up his secret recipe for success in these formats. The key, he explained, was good timing and to read the mood of the crowd. “It is like being a jazz musician. So, you and the audience are in the same zone,"" he explained. “It’s almost a Zen. You relax totally. You absorb the question. You feel the audience environment. And then you intuit what you should say.”Once you have a rhythm, Gingrich added, you know when to pounce and, more importantly, when not to. “You want to hit one or two home runs a night,"" he explained. ""You don’t want to try and hit 16.”Few candidates had as many viral moments. There was the time in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, when Gingrich lectured (condescendingly, one may argue) Juan Williams for asking whether his criticism of food stamp recipients was racially insensitive. And there was the time when Gingrich admonished CNN's John King for having the temerity to ask him -- at the top of the debate -- about the uncomfortable circumstances of his separation from his second wife.“It wasn’t as satisfying [as the Williams episode] but it was actually unbelievable,"" Gingrich said. ""The audience decided instantaneously they were with me and therefore they were against him.""Over the course of that campaign, Gingrich discovered that -- surprise -- conservatives like a candidate willing to bash the media, even Fox News. So he happily obliged.Trump, Gingrich said, has adopted that approach but brought it to a ferocious, almost uncomfortable new level. “These debates are totally different,"" Gingrich said. ""You need to understand that Trump is the grizzly bear in ‘The Revenant.’ When you hit him, he devours you. He can’t help himself. And so, he creates an environment unlike anything I’ve ever seen.”So what would Newt do about the voracious real estate billionaire? He pointed to his right, and replied: “I’d say, beat him up!”Listen to the podcast above, or download it on iTunes. And while you're there, please subscribe to, rate and review our show.

She did pretty well, too, making it to the sixth round before getting fired.Suffice it to say it was not a particularly memorable experience for Kardashian. When we recently confronted her with a reminder that she was on the show -- which placed her on a team with Joan and Melissa Rivers, the poker player Annie Duke and T-Boz of TLC, among others -- Kardashian looked surprised and then admitted that she forgot she had been on it. She hadn't even been particularly invested at the time, she added. Asked whether she took to heart any of the business lessons Trump purportedly taught through his reality series, Kardashian paused, then said Trump didn't interact with contestants outside of firing them in the boardroom. But while Kardashian might not have taken away much from her interactions with Trump, she did take a few things away from a couple of her teammates.""I learned a great deal from Joan Rivers and Melissa Rivers,"" the reality star said. ""I love Joan as a businesswoman. It's just amazing how long she made her career go for and just how wonderful she was to everyone around her.""She then added that the main lessons she took from her teammates were ""personal"" in nature.In its second season, ""Celebrity Apprentice"" split up contestants into teams of women and men, landing Kardashian on team Athena, named for the Greek goddess of wisdom, and the men on team KOTU, an acronym for ""Kings of the Universe."" Kardashian helped her team to victory in four challenges: baking cupcakes, creating a comic book character, selling wedding dresses and running a New York City hotel.But she missed part of a task in order to complete a court-ordered DUI class in Los Angeles, and was eliminated in the sixth episode. Trump, apparently, was not aware his contestant had received a DUI, and in a final scene in ""the boardroom,"" told Kardashian how he ""hate[s] people who drive under the influence."" In a blog post, the reality star shared her take on her firing.""I will NEVER say that what I did was right, but I think it is completely unrelated to my place on the show and I don’t think I should have been fired for that reason alone,"" she wrote. ""I have tried to bring awareness to how serious DUIs are and I am trying to make some right out of my huge mistake.""But her experience on ""Celebrity Apprentice"" wasn't for naught, introducing her to an inspiring entertainment business icon in Rivers, who died unexpectedly in 2014.""Even as a businesswoman, [Joan Rivers] had her hands in a ton of different projects. She never slowed down, and I really respect that,"" Kardashian said. ""It's kind of me and my sisters' hustle."""

15,POLITICS,"Hillary Clinton's Lead Pipe Answer 'Made Me Vomit In My Mouth,' Flint Questioner Says",Arthur Delaney,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/clinton-flint-water_us_56ddb0e4e4b0ffe6f8ea02a7,Neither Clinton nor Bernie Sanders was aggressive on lead pipe removal.,2016-03-07,Flint resident Lee-Anne Walters testifies during a congressional hearing on the Flint water crisis in February.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Flint resident Lee-Anne Walters didn't like Bernie Sanders' response to her question about lead pipes during Sunday night's Democratic presidential debate in Flint. But she really didn't like Hillary Clinton's response.""I hated Hillary Clinton's answer,"" Walters, 38, told The Huffington Post on Monday. ""It actually made me vomit in my mouth.""Walters, an early whistleblower in the Flint water crisis, had asked whether as president, Clinton and the Vermont senator would promise to require public water systems in the United States to remove lead pipes. Clinton and rival Bernie Sanders did not give direct answers. Instead, Clinton proposed getting rid of all lead sources, including paint and dust, within five years. ""We will commit to a priority to change the water systems and we will commit within five years to remove lead from everywhere,"" Clinton said. To Walters, five years is an unacceptable timeline. ""To tell a Flint resident that we'll handle this in five years is no different than what the city was telling us and what the state was telling us,"" Walters said. Walters and other Flint residents knew their water had gone bad soon after the city switched from the Detroit water system to the Flint River as its water source in 2014. The city was under the control of an emergency manager appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder (R), and for more than a year the Snyder administration insisted the water was safe to drink even though it looked and tasted weird, caused rashes, and angry residents were marching in the streets. Last fall, after a local pediatrician reported the rate of lead poisoning among Flint kids had jumped from 2.4 percent to 4.9 percent, the Snyder administration admitted it had failed to ensure the water wouldn't leach lead from the city's aging pipes. One of Walters' own was among the children who suffered elevated blood lead. Childhood exposure to even small amounts of lead can cause permanent brain damage. Democrats have heavily criticized Snyder, and used the beleaguered city of 100,000 as a backdrop for their debate on Sunday. Snyder has apologized and embarked on a plan to replace Flint's pipes in partnership with Mayor Karen Weaver.Yet outside of Flint, there has been little effort to change the federal regulations that say lead pipes are OK, even after Flint's experience showed how weak the regulations can be. The Environmental Protection Agency says 10 million American homes and buildings receive water from pipes at least partially made of lead.Sanders at the debate promised that under a Sanders administration the EPA would keep its eye on water safety, which is essentially what the agency is already supposed to do. Walters considered it a lame answer, but a more honest one.Another thing she disliked about what Clinton said was the former Secretary of State's focus on lead from paint and dust. Epidemiologists consider paint and dust to be the more significant sources of lead exposure, but public water systems have used those factors to downplay concerns about water lead.""If you look at the numbers, most of the grants and funding go to lead paint, so to lump it all together is unacceptable,"" Walters said.

Mike Lee (R-Utah) thinks Michigan can handle the Flint water crisis on its own.

Mike Lee doesn't think the U.S. Congress needs to get involved with the water crisis in Flint, Michigan.The Utah Republican is preventing a vote on bipartisan legislation that would help cities get loans for infrastructure repairs if they face similar conditions.""The only thing Congress is contributing to the Flint recovery is political grandstanding,"" Lee said in a statement on Friday. ""The people and policymakers of Michigan right now have all the government resources they need to fix the problem.""Flint's water is unsafe to drink because of high levels of lead, which began leaching from the city's pipes in 2014 after the state failed to ensure the water was treated to prevent it from corroding the pipes. Democrats have heaped blame on Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R), who has apologized repeatedly. In January, Democrats proposed $600 million in direct assistance to Flint, but have since negotiated with Republicans on a $220 million measure that would make loan credits available to any city facing a water emergency. A spokeswoman for Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), one of the Republicans who worked on the measure for weeks, said Monday that the senator is still negotiating. ""Inhofe is working to address concerns from all parties involved and to find a responsible path forward for this fully paid-for solution, which allows all states to seek a loan to help their communities that are facing dangerous repercussions from aging water infrastructure,"" she said. Snyder and the Michigan state legislature have proposed $230 million worth of assistance, with $70 million already allocated for things like bottled water and beginning to replace lead pipes. Lee said the state can continue ponying up its own money. Lead is a national problem, however, with 10 million American homes and buildings getting water from lead pipes, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. It could cost hundreds of billions of dollars to replace them all. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) said Friday she was surprised that Lee had used a procedural hold on the Flint-inspired measure instead of letting it get an up-or-down vote. ""If Senator Lee opposes this bipartisan bill that is fully paid-for, he should vote against it, but he should not block it from even getting a vote,"" she said. Presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) also placed a hold on the legislation, but released it after a review. Laura Barron-Lopez contributed reporting. "
17,POLITICS,Clinton And Sanders Show Republicans What A Real Debate Looks Like,Jonathan Cohn,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hillary-clinton-bernie-sanders-flint-debate_us_56dcf045e4b0000de4050807,"Flint debate is sharp, cantankerous and deeply substantive.",2016-03-07,"Clinton and Sanders got into it over trade, guns and pretty much everything else on the domestic agenda.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56dcf0be1e0000950070f5b4.jpeg?cache=7eulrmsBTy&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"FLINT, Mich. -- The campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination is supposedly over, with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton clearly ahead of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and on her way to capturing a majority of delegates.But for two hours on Sunday night, Clinton and Sanders debated as if the outcome was very much in doubt -- sparring over everything from trade and corporate welfare to health care and guns.The debate, held in Flint, Michigan, was feisty and even cantankerous. Clinton and Sanders had several exchanges where they tried to talk over one another; Sanders, as always, brought his full array of facial expressions.But the debate was also deeply substantive -- an argument between two seasoned politicians who have obviously given a lot of thought to the problems facing America, and what they would do about them.The contrast to the Republican debate from last week, with its juvenile insults, could not have been more stark. Instead of discussing penis length, Clinton and Sanders argued over the sizes of their respective infrastructure programs.In short, both Clinton and Sanders looked ready for prime time.The debate began, appropriately, with an extended discussion of Flint’s water crisis -- and what the candidates would do, both to help the people of Flint who suffered because of lead in the water and to prevent future tragedies. And it was one of the few discussions of the night when Clinton and Sanders were more or less saying the same thing. Both called for setting up programs for Flint families, both demanded the resignation of Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder (R), and both called for testing of lead in pipes across the country. Sanders said that it is “beyond belief that children in Flint, Michigan in the United States of America in the year 2016 are being poisoned. That is clearly not what this country should be about.”Clinton said, “This is not the only place where this kind of action is needed. We have a lot of communities right now in our country where the level of toxins in the water, including lead, are way above what anybody should tolerate. … I want to tackle this problem across the board.”But then an audience member from Flint asked what the candidates would do to keep manufacturing jobs from leaving the country -- and the sparks started flying. Clinton said she wanted to use a mix of “carrots and sticks,” by which she meant new incentives to create factories in the U.S. and a proposal (just announced a few days ago) to “claw back” tax breaks from companies that transfer operations overseas.Sanders used the occasion to pounce -- attacking Clinton, as he has before, for backing the North American Free Trade Agreement and other trade deals. “I am very glad … that Secretary Clinton discovered religion on this issue, but it's a little bit too late,” Sanders said.“Secretary Clinton supported virtually every one of the disastrous trade agreements written by corporate America.”A series of contentious exchanges followed. Clinton attacked Sanders for voting against gun control measures, while Sanders attacked Clinton for going soft on Wall Street. They fought over the Export-Import Bank, the controversial government program that is supposed to help American companies that sell their wares overseas. Clinton supports it, saying it provides critical support for American jobs; Sanders opposes it, calling it a form of corporate welfare reform.Clinton at one point attacked Sanders for opposing President Barack Obama’s rescue of the auto industry, saying that Sanders had voted against it. It’s an argument she hadn’t made before, and the Sanders campaign pointed out that the senator had taken other votes to support the rescue -- and had defended it publicly on a radio show.But, as debates go, this one had relatively few instances of campaigns challenging each other on the basic facts. Instead, the sharp debate offered Democratic Party voters a clear sense of the choice they face in this primary campaign. Stylistically, Clinton measures her words carefully, while Sanders relishes every chance to say something blunt or bold. Clinton talks about programs, while Sanders likes to invoke big themes. Clinton talks about what she can do, while Sanders talks about what he’d like to do. A classic case was an exchange the two had over infrastructure. Clinton rattled off her plans for more than $200 billion in new infrastructure spending, including the creation of a so-called infrastructure bank. Sanders noted that he wanted to invest more than four times that much -- $1 trillion, over five years -- not just to shore up infrastructure but also to create millions of new jobs. Clinton would say her approach is more realistic; Sanders would say his approach is more appropriate for an economy performing well under capacity. Of course, there are real and important differences between the two. Sanders thinks that taking donations from Wall Street is singularly corrupting, while Clinton thinks it’s possible to take Wall Street money while still being tough on the financial industry in office. Sanders wants to replace the health care system with a government-run, “single-payer” health insurance scheme, while Clinton has said she wants to build on the Affordable Care Act, further expanding and bolstering insurance coverage step by step.But on virtually all of these issues -- with the notable exception of trade, on which Donald Trump says things that sound a lot like Sanders -- the philosophical difference between Clinton and Sanders is tiny compared with the difference between Democrats and the Republicans running for president. Near the end of the debate, both Clinton and Sanders noted that they still have a lot in common -- and that voters would be better off with either of them than with a Republican.“We’re going to invest a lot in mental health,” Sanders quipped. “And if you watch these Republican debates, you know why we need to invest in mental health.”"

Scott Walker's (R) newly-appointed state Supreme Court justice, Rebecca Bradley, once wrote columns calling gay people ""queers"" and arguing that individuals who get AIDS deserve no sympathy. Bradley is a conservative judicial superstar, rising through the ranks during Walker's tenure with the support of groups like the Wisconsin Club for Growth. The governor first named her to the Milwaukee County Circuit Court in 2012, and then he elevated her to Wisconsin Court of Appeals in May 2015. In October, when a vacancy arose on the state Supreme Court, Walker again gave her a plum appointment. Bradley is now up for a full 10-year term, with voters heading to the polls on April 5. On Monday, the liberal group One Wisconsin Now released columns Bradley wrote in 1992 for the student newspaper at Marquette University, urging her to resign from office.

""But the homosexuals and drug addicts who do essentially kill themselves and others through their own behavior deservedly receive none of my sympathy,"" she wrote in another column.

19,MEDIA,Ted Cruz Suggests The Media Is Conspiring To Help Donald Trump Win Primary,Michael Calderone,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ted-cruz-reporters-donald-trump_us_56dda6afe4b0000de4052dc2,"The Texas senator is right that reporters can dig deeper into the front-runner's past, but it's hard to believe they're sitting on big stories.",2016-03-07,Ted Cruz claimed the media is holding back negative stories on Donald Trump to presumably help the Democratic nominee.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56dda8891e0000c60070f621.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (R) played press critic Sunday on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” arguing that the media “helped create” the Donald Trump phenomenon by essentially giving the Republican front-runner hundreds of millions of dollars in free airtime. He has a point. But Cruz moved to shakier ground when next claiming reporters are actually withholding potentially damaging stories about Trump until after the Republican primary, presumably to help the Democratic nominee in the general election. “I think an awful lot of reporters -- I can't tell you how many media outlets I hear have this great exposé on Donald, on different aspects of his business dealings, or his past, but they said, you know what, we're going to hold it to June or July,” Cruz said. “We're not going to run it now.”Cruz's claim should play well with conservatives who believe ""liberal"" journalists care more about electing Democrats than breaking news. But it's hard to believe reporters would sit on big stories, and risk getting scooped in the heat of a highly competitive election season.A Cruz spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.Cruz’s assertion Sunday comes amid recent chatter that a major revelation could help dislodge the Republican front-runner. On Feb. 24, Mitt Romney said there may be a “bombshell” in Trump’s tax returns. Five days later, BuzzFeed reported that Trump may have told the New York Times editorial board off-the-record that his position on immigration was more flexible than he'd said publicly. “Face the Nation” host John Dickerson appeared skeptical of Cruz's claim that reporters are holding back stories.“You're saying reporters have told you that?” he asked.“Absolutely,” Cruz responded, while declining to name said media outlets. “I can tell you there is so much there,” he added. It's true there is much out there. The Huffington Post noted last week that the national media has only scratched the surface on Trump’s spotty business record and murky connections after nine months of excessive coverage.But lack of scrutiny doesn't equal media conspiracy. The media, broadly speaking, didn’t take Trump seriously enough early on to fully vet his record. And the self-described ""ratings machine"" has been adept at getting the media to chase his running stream of insults and wild claims. Another factor has been that Republican rivals failed to frame Trump's business record as one built on fraud and debt, which anti-Trump forces are now trying to do. During the CBS interview, Cruz asked when was the last time Trump’s tax returns have come up.Journalists have inquired about Trump’s tax returns since he jumped in the race in mid-June, though Trump has consistently punted on the issue. Initially, news outlets reported that he planned to disclose them within a couple of months of announcing his candidacy. On Aug. 2, Trump told Dickerson he had “no major problem” making the returns public, while also tying the disclosure to the release of Hillary Clinton’s emails from a private account she used while secretary of state, which has been ongoing. In late September, Trump said he’d release his returns in the “not too distant future.” He was still “thinking about it” in October and “working” on the matter in January. Last month, he pledged to release them “at some point” in the future. The media could've pressed Trump harder on his missing tax returns in the past nine months, but Dickerson also pointed out to Cruz that he could've made the lack of disclosure a bigger issue. “I could have, and I do often,” Cruz said. “But as Mitt Romney rightly observed, the fact that Donald won't hand over his tax returns suggests there's a bombshell in there. The fact that journalists are not raising the question of what Donald Trump told The New York Times editorial board, the reports are …”“But the journalists brought it up, which gave you the platform to talk about it,” Dickerson said. “So, surely they are. BuzzFeed wrote about it, so they are talking about it.”“I promise you, come the general election, that will be the singular focus of the media,” Cruz said. “And I think Republicans, we have been burned by that before.”Editor's note: Donald Trump is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist, birther and bully who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims -- 1.6 billion members of an entire religion -- from entering the U.S."

She died on Sunday at age 94.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -- Soon after the news broke that former first lady Nancy Reagan had died on Sunday, obituary writers and old White House staffers set about assessing her legacy. The New York Times credited her with turning around President Ronald Reagan’s sinking poll numbers after the Iran-Contra scandal. Looking for an excuse to run pictures of the first lady talking to the TV character ALF and sitting on Mr. T’s lap, MSNBC tried to make the case that she brought Hollywood to the White House.All of this sells Nancy Reagan a little short. Her most lasting -- and devastating -- impact may be as a drug war policymaker (although the Reagan record on addressing the AIDS crisis is also shameful). Not only did her ""Just Say No"" campaign become as famous as any sitcom star's catchphrase, but she also supported a notorious drug treatment for teenagers that is still being practiced.Reagan and the first lady were big backers of Straight Inc., a chain of drug rehabilitation centers co-founded by top GOP fundraiser Mel Sembler. The facilities, which treated teenagers, promoted the idea that drug addiction can be conquered through a combination of isolation and verbal and physical abuse.The treatment, which could go on for months, consisted of daylong sessions in which Straight Inc. staff would yell at or assault residents and then get them to turn on each other. The first lady was so proud of her association with Straight Inc. that she brought Princess Diana to one of the facilities in Springfield, Virginia, for a tour. It didn't matter that ""60 Minutes"" had published an expose on the chain a year earlier. Last year, as part of a year-long investigative story on the heroin epidemic and the U.S. drug treatment system, The Huffington Post published an original audio documentary about Straight Inc. and its predecessor, The Seed. Former residents recalled harrowing moments during treatment and described how the experience shaped their lives. One Straight Inc. resident told us of being forced to humiliate others as part of the program: ""I was in this universe where the social currency was the infliction of pain, and I took part in that wholeheartedly so that I could get out of there. And that was my treatment.""He recalled having to verbally punish another resident who later committed suicide.You can listen to the full audio documentary here.Mother Jones reported in 2007 that Straight Inc. closed in the '90s after facing several legal judgments. But there have been spinoffs. The treatment philosophy Nancy Reagan promoted persists, especially in teen boot camps and residential treatment centers. Meanwhile, you can still find websites dedicated to helping the survivors of Straight Inc. "

The “We R Who We R” singer attended the event on Saturday night, where she was honored with the Visibility Award for speaking out against the bullying many members of the LGBT community ― especially the youth ― face. When she took to the stage to accept her award, the 29-year-old singer explained that her favorite aspect of fame is being able to help others.“Fame is strange, and unnatural, and I’m grateful for it mainly because it has put me in the position where I can actually do something positive for the world,” she said. “And that is really the best part of it.” Kesha then mentioned her own personal struggles and got a little teary-eyed.“As many of you know I am going through some personal things that have been really intense and hard lately and I just want to say thank you for any support I’ve received,” Kesha said, pausing as the crowd cheered her on.She then continued, talking about her strong connection to the LGBT community.“I’ve met many members of the LGBT community, and some very, very close friends, who have come close to taking their own lives because of the abuse they’ve had to deal with, and that is heartbreaking,” Kesha said. “I don’t want to live in a world where we treat each other like that.”As she held back tears, the singer added, “That’s why my message has always been about being yourself. And we really have to love each other and support each other.” You can watch her entire speech below. (It starts around 10:00.)One of the ""personal things"" Kesha references in her speech is likely her ongoing legal dispute with Gottwald, whom she accused of sexual assault and battery in 2014. Since then, the singer hasn't recorded any new music, as she was bound to her contract with Gottwald (and Sony). However, in February a judge ruled that while the sexual assault allegations aren't enough to free her from her contract, she is now allowed to make music with producers other than Gottwald. Kesha has received plenty of support from fellow celebrities throughout her ongoing fight. Lady Gaga, Demi Lovato and Adele have voiced their support for the ""Blow"" singer, while Taylor Swift donated $250,000 to help ""with any of her financial needs during this trying time."" Her fans have also rallied online, starting the #FreeKesha hashtag on Twitter. "

He chose the @ symbol -- then considered an obscure keyboard character -- to separate usernames from email hosts. Tomlinson came up with the idea while working for Bolt Beranek and Newman, the software company that developed the Internet precursor ARPANET, in 1971.“I looked at the keyboard, and I thought: ‘What can I choose here that won’t be confused with a username?'” Tomlinson said in a 2012 profile in Wired, adding that he can't remember what his first email said. “They were all test messages, and whatever came to hand as I put my fingers on the keyboard is what I would send,” he said. “The first one could have said almost anything.”The innovation earned him a place in the Internet Hall of Fame earlier in 2012.""Tomlinson's email program brought about a complete revolution, fundamentally changing the way people communicate, including the way businesses, from huge corporations to tiny mom-and-pop shops, operate and the way millions of people shop, bank, and keep in touch with friends and family, whether they are across town or across oceans,"" the Hall of Fame wrote when he was inducted.
