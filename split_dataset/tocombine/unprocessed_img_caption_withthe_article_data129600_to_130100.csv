It was the billionaire mayor himself who championed a litany of art initiatives throughout his three terms, even proposing $50 million in taxpayer funds to support the Culture Shed, an organization aiming to house special programs and events including Fashion Week. But with a new mayor now in charge, The New York Times is reporting an air of uncertainty is looming over the fashion world as it looks towards its future relationship with Bill de Blasio. “Nobody in fashion knows this guy,” Steven Kolb, the Council of Fashion Designers of America's chief executive, told the paper. During last year's mayoral campaign, de Blasio ran on a progressive platform promising to fix income inequality in the city, positioning himself as something of an anti-Bloomberg. Joanna Coles, editor of Cosmopolitan, said that very ""tale of two cities"" narrative probably won't resonate with the fashion community. “I don’t think that felt relevant to people in fashion,"" Coles told the Times. ""Not because everybody is dreaming of a mansion on the Upper East Side but because fashion feels broader and wider and more artistic than that.”But many, including designer and prominent New Yorker Diane von Furstenberg, have expressed a hopeful willingness to preserve a bond with the mayor's office. On Thursday, the mayor visited the CFDA’s Fashion Incubator, where he pledged to support the industry as an integral economic and cultural part of the city “I loved him, loved him,"" Furstenberg told Politicker on Thursday. ""He’s so attractive!” After de Blasio commented that his grandmother once worked in the Garment District, von Furstenberg reportedly said with glee, ""You're one of us!""

If you want a perfect glass of sake, go to Japan. And if you want a mouthwatering pint of any other kind of beer, your best bet might be the Midwest. In the last few days, RateBeer.com has released awards for the world's best beers, brewers, retailers and new releases, compiled from 2013 reviews of more than 240,000 beers from over 16,000 brewers worldwide. What might surprise some is how well beers from Michigan, Wisconsin and other Midwest locales fared. Of RateBeer's awards for the best beer in the world in each of 21 styles, Midwestern brews won quite a few, including best IPA, stout, amber ale, sour and top beer in the country. Many of the winning brewers -- like Bell's Brewery, Rogue Ales or Hair of the Dog Brewing Company -- won't be unexpected for beer fans, but there may be a few new names. Below, check out some of the best beers in the world in a few of our favorite categories, as well as the overall best beer in America. Best India Pale Ale (IPA): Bell's Two Hearted Ale, an IPA, Bell's Brewery, Galesburg, Mich.Bell's mainstay IPA, hopped with a Centennial hop varietal from the Pacific Northwest, has a top rating on RateBeer and can be found in the fridges of most Michigan beer enthusiasts. But good news for New York City: the western Michigan brewer will be on tap in bars across the city starting next week. Best Double IPA: Russian River Pliny the Elder, an imperial/double IPA, Russian River Brewing, Santa Rosa, Calif.Named after a Roman scholar who lived in the first century, the double IPA has 8 percent alcohol by volume (ABV). But it shouldn't be left to get ancient: they produce it in small batches and say it's best enjoyed fresh.

Though at 16 percent ABV, it might not be a good breakfast choice. Last but not least, the Best Beer in America: Founder's KBS (Kentucky Breakfast Stout), Grand Rapids, Mich. With a 100 percent rating on RateBeer and an 11.2 ABV, the KBS also won RateBeer's best stout in the world. The strong imperial stout is aged in oak bourbon barrels.

During the 2014 Sochi Olympics, HuffPost Healthy Living will take a look at lifestyle and fitness lessons from competitors, coaches and former Olympians alike. We recently had the opportunity to email with Kikkan Randall, the most successful U.S. female cross-country skier in history, who has partnered with Kashi leading up to her fourth Olympic Games.You've said you made big changes to your diet four years ago. How did that improve your performance? Why did you decide to make changes to your diet to begin with? Improving my diet has allowed me to have more good days in training because I put the right fuel in my body. My energy levels have been more consistent, and my recovery is optimized so I can train harder in the next session. I knew I needed to improve my diet because the closer you get to the top, the smaller the margins become and the harder it is to improve. You have to maximize every part of your training and lifestyle.Do you have a go-to pre-race meal? What about a favorite high-performance breakfast? Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day and definitely one of the most important. It’s the first thing I think of when I wake up in the morning! A blend of carbohydrates and protein gives me long-lasting energy. I also love my cup of coffee or espresso in the morning. Caffeine has actually been proven to increase endurance as well!How do you think sleep affects your performance? Do you have any tricks for making sure you get a good night's sleep? Sleep is incredibly important for cross-country skiers. We push our bodies so hard, and it's important to recover between training sessions and races. I try to get at least nine hours of sleep each night with a mid-afternoon nap. Even if it's only 20 minutes, the nap makes my next session more efficient.I travel with my own pillow and bring earplugs and an eye mask so that I can create a comfortable and quiet sleep environment anywhere. If I find my mind is racing when I lie down, I focus on taking 10 deep breaths, which helps me relax and drift off to sleep.What are your goals for Sochi? For the first time in my Olympic career I am excited to be coming into this Olympics with real medal chances. The freestyle sprint is my best event, and I have confidence from winning the test event in Sochi last year and the overall World Cup sprint title the last two years. Even more exciting than my individual shot at a medal, however, would be our chances in both team events. Our women's team is in a position to challenge for the medals podium, which would be a first for the U.S.My personal goals for Sochi are to show up on the starting line knowing I prepared as well as I possibly could have, and to be ready to give my very best effort. I know that if I have prepared well and bring my best effort and focus to my performance, I can contend for the Olympic gold!If I find my mind drifting to past troubles or future unpredictability, I picture a big stop sign and bring my mind back to what I'm doing in that moment. If I focus on what I can control and going through the process right in front of me, I know everything else will work out as it should. If I feel butterflies in my stomach, I tell those butterflies to find their formation and get ready to fly!"
3,WELLNESS,Woman In China Dies From Bird Flu Strain Previously Unknown In Humans,"Reuters, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/h10n8-bird-flu-china-woman-death_us_5b9dd65ee4b03a1dcc8d936a,Chinese authorities last week confirmed a second human case of H10N8 which was reported for the first known time in humans,2014-02-05,"A photo taken on January 6, 2014 shows live poultry for sale on a street in Shanghai on January 8, 2014. China has reported on January 7 its first death, the day before, from the H7N9 bird flu virus in 2014 after a significant drop-off in fatalities following an outbreak last year. AFP PHOTO/Peter PARKS (Photo credit should read PETER PARKS/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dd65e1f00002d0021c4a7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Kate KellandLONDON, Feb 5 (Reuters) - The death of a woman in China from a strain of bird flu previously unknown in humans is a reminder of the ever-present potential pandemic threat from mutating animal viruses, scientists said on Wednesday.The new strain, called H10N8, has so far infected only two people - a fatal case in a 73-year-old and another in a woman who is critically ill in hospital. But the fact it has jumped from birds to humans is an important warning, they said.""We should always be worried when viruses cross the species barrier from birds or animals to humans, as it is very unlikely that we will have prior immunity to protect us,"" said Jeremy Farrar, director of Wellcome Trust and an expert on flu.""We should be especially worried when those viruses show characteristics that suggest they have the capacity to replicate easily or to be virulent or resistant to drugs. This virus ticks several of these boxes and therefore is a cause for concern.""Chinese authorities last week confirmed a second human case of H10N8 which was reported for the first known time in humans in December 2013.It has emerged as another new and often fatal strain of bird flu, called H7N9, has infected at least 286 people in China, Taiwan and Hong Kong, killing around 60 of them. GENETIC REASSORTMENTChinese scientists writing in The Lancet medical journal who conducted a genetic analysis on samples of the H10N8 virus from the woman who died said it was a new genetic reassortment of other strains of bird flu viruses, including one called H9N2 that is relatively well known in poultry in China.Somewhat worryingly, the virus - like H7N9 - has also evolved ""some genetic characteristics that may allow it to replicate efficiently in humans"", said Yuelong Shu of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention in Beijing.According to the scientists' study of her case, the 73-year-old victim, from Nanchang City in eastern China, was admitted to hospital with fever and severe pneumonia on November 30, 2013. Despite being treated with antibiotic and antivirals, she deteriorated rapidly, developed multiple organ failure and died nine days after her symptoms first started.Investigations found the woman had been at a live poultry market a few days before becoming infected. But no H10N8 virus was found in samples collected from the market, the scientists said, so the source of the infection remains unknown.Mingbin Liu from Nanchang City Center for Disease Control and Prevention added that the emergence of a second human case of H10N8 in a 55-year-old woman ""is of great concern because it reveals that the H10N8 virus has continued to circulate and may cause more human infections in future"".John McCauley, head of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Influenza at Britain's National Institute for Medical Research said the emergence of H10N8, and of H7N9 ""reminds us to be aware of human infections from animal influenza viruses.""Previously we did not think that H7N9 infections might be so lethal. Now we also must consider H10N8 infections as well,"" he said in an emailed comment.He added, however, that the risk of this virus spreading from person to person ""seems low since the H10N8 virus is not expected to be transmitted well between humans"".Other flu experts not directly involved in the study on H10N8 agreed it was an important reminder of the potential threat from circulating and mutating flu viruses, but said it did not appear to be a particular concern for the moment.Ben Neuman, a virologist at Britain's University of Reading said while the fatal H10N8 case was a ""personal tragedy for the family and friends of the victim"" and needed to be watched closely, ""there is no cause for alarm at this time"".
