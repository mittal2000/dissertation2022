2,PARENTING,'Pink Slime' Ground Beef Product Returns To School Lunches In 4 States: Report,Joe Satran,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pink-slime_us_5b9d801ee4b03a1dcc88d102,"The safety of ""pink slime"" remains an unsettled question.

The nation?s school districts are turning up their noses at ?pink slime,? the beef product that caused a public uproar earlier this year. The U.S. Department of Agriculture says the vast majority of states participating in its National School Lunch Program have opted to order ground beef that doesn?t contain the product known as lean finely textured beef. (AP Photo/Nati Harnik, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d801e3c00005b000a2cf9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"School officials in four states have decided to allow Beef Products Inc.'s lean finely textured beef -- the ammonia-treated mash of meat trimmings more commonly known as ""pink slime"" -- back into their school lunch programs for the coming year, Politico's Bill Tomson and Helena Bottemiller Evich report. Government data uncovered by Tomson and Evich show that schools in Illinois, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Texas ordered ground beef that ""may contain the controversial product"" for use in school lunches over the next nine months. They join schools in Iowa, Nebraska and South Dakota, which didn't stop serving ""pink slime"" after a national outcry over the product erupted in spring 2012. Public schools in these seven states, which together account for more than a fifth of the country's total enrollment, ordered about 2 million pounds of the questionable ground beef for the 2013-2014 school year. Schools across the country ordered about 7 million pounds of ""pink slime"" for use in ground beef in the 2011-2012 school year.The safety of ""pink slime"" remains an unsettled question. Though some food safety advocates, and many in the meat industry, insist that lean finely textured beef is just as safe as other ground beef, a Pulitzer Prize-winning report in The New York Times showed that numerous government reports have connected the product with elevated levels of disease-causing E. coli bacteria. A blitz of bad press that started with an ABC News report by Diane Sawyer convinced much of the American public that the product was at least gross, and possibly dangerous, prompting most restaurant chains, supermarkets and public schools to ditch the product about a year and a half ago. Schools are likely embracing the mushy meat-stuff again now for three reasons: Outrage about ""pink slime"" seems to have subsided, beef prices are hovering around all-time highs and school lunch budgets have been tight for years.According to Politico, adding lean finely textured beef to ground beef reduces its cost by about 3 percent.

""Sometimes",2013-09-10,"FILE - In this Jan. 13, 2012 photo, Chobani Greek Yogurt is seen at the Chobani plant in South Edmeston, N.Y. The recent yogurt boom of upstate New York has meant more jobs and more economic activity. But it has not led to a bigger dairy herd in the state, even as mega-producer Chobani reaches beyond New York for some of its milk. (AP Photo/Mike Groll, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9d801026000033007fe64b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"A popular brand of yogurt is at the center of a recall and investigation after allegedly sickening customers, but the symptoms don't match what scientists know about the contaminating mold. The Associated Press reported on Sept. 10 that the Food and Drug Administration is investigating reports by 89 people that they felt ill -- with some experiencing nausea and cramping -- after eating Chobani yogurt. Chobani recently issued a recall for some of its yogurts due to contamination with the mold Mucor circinelloides.Randy Worobo, a professor of Food Science in Cornell University’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, explained to HuffPost that it's far too soon to say that yogurt was the cause of these complaints, as this particular kind of mold isn't known to cause food-borne illness. How the mold first colonized the yogurts is still not clear, according to news reports. However, Worobo noted that while some strains of M. circinelloides grow very slowly at refrigeration temperatures, other strains can grow faster.Worobo, who was not involved in Chobani's testing of the yogurt and is only commenting in his capacity as a food safety and microbial food spoilage expert, said that in the past, any cases of yogurt being contaminated with this kind of mold has only led to yogurt spoilage, made clear by tell-tale signs like package bloating, a weird smell or a carbonated taste to the yogurt. What's more, the only instances Worobo knew of in which M. circinelloides actually caused illness, was when immunocompromised people -- particularly people who have recently undergone surgery, catheterization or some other invasive procedure -- were exposed to the fungus non-orally, leading to the skin disorder dermatitis or a pulmonary fungal infection.However, the mold ""doesn't produce a typical toxin that causes what we call a vomiting response,"" he said.""As soon as you have nausea and vomiting, that's an indication that it's a food-borne intoxication,"" Worobo added, explaining that food-borne illness takes place between 24 and 72 hours after consumption. While Worobo said that based on the information available it's unlikely that this particular mold caused these nausea and cramping symptoms, that's not to say that there is some food-borne pathogen in the yogurt that's not the mold that is causing the symptoms (though Chobani has not reported any instances of this). It's also possible that eating spoiled food can trigger a person's gag reflex, he noted.""If the food tastes spoiled, sometimes it can make you vomit. but that doesn't make it a pathogen,"" Worobo said. ""Sometimes spoiled foods can cause upset stomachs, and it doesn't necessarily have to be linked to an illness.""He explained that right now, the FDA is likely following up with all the people who reported symptoms after eating Chobani yogurt to learn more about their complaints and what they ate in the hours and days prior to the symptoms. However, if nausea and cramping are the primary symptoms reported by the 89 people, then ""it doesn't match what this mold spoilage actually would cause for an illness,"" Worobo said. "

""They top the charts with their high levels of antioxidants and phytochemicals to keep your brain young, skin glowing, and reduce your risk of heart disease, diabetes and cancer."" Consider the health benefits of these nine berries, from acai to goji:More From U.S. News: Green Smoothies 101: Health Benefits and Recipes Upgrade Your Health With These 7 Superfoods Seeds 101: A Guide, From Chia to HempAcai Berries  These, Boone says, are the anti-aging super berries. They're small, dark purple, and grow on the tall palm trees of South America. Acai berries are packed with 19 amino acids, an array of fatty acids, and an impressive number of cell-protecting antioxidants. In addition to boosting immunity and protecting against chronic diseases, acai berries are good for the heart and lower the risk of neurological diseases.Blueberries  Just call them the ""blue dynamos."" Blueberries are packed with manganese, which is an energy-boosting mineral; about 4 grams of fiber per cup; and vitamin K, which helps build bones. Research suggests that a blueberry-rich diet improves motor skills and helps fight diseases such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes. Try tossing fresh blueberries into salads, smoothies, quinoa or baked goods.Camu Camu Berries  These small, red berries grow on tropical bushes in the Amazon rain forest. They offer a tangy taste and are packed with vitamin C, which explains why they're traditionally used to fight colds and the flu. They also help maintain healthy eyes, gums and skin, and play a role in strengthening the tendons and ligaments, Boone says. If you can't find them fresh, add a teaspoon of camu camu berry powder to juices, smoothies, and salad dressings.Cranberries  Turns out they're not just for Thanksgiving. Cranberries are infection-fighting super berries that ought to be enjoyed year round, Boone says. They're packed with a group of flavonoids called proanthocyanidins, which help lower the risk of urinary tract infections. Research also suggests they help keep the heart healthy and fight cancer. Try mixing fresh cranberries into smoothies, sprinkling the dried variety into oatmeal or baking them into muffins or breads.Goji Berries  If vitality is your aim, this is your berry. Chinese medicine practitioners commonly use bright red-orange goji berries to treat diabetes and high blood pressure, maintain eye health, and nourish the liver and kidneys. They're packed with vitamins C and E, along with carotenoids like beta-carotene and lycopene. Some research suggests goji berries help increase metabolism and boost energy levels. Try snacking on dry goji berries, or dropping a handful into trail mix, cereal, or salads.Goldenberries  These yellow-orange berries are a superfood for both energy and managing weight, Boone says. They're rich in vitamin B, protein and fiber, and research suggests they help regulate metabolism and keep you feeling fuller for longer. They also provide strong doses of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds. Fresh goldenberries aren't common outside South America, but the dried variety is available at most supermarkets.Maqui Berries  Photo: Flickr:Dick Culbert These small, purple berries, which grow in southern Chile, have been used to treat conditions from ulcers to fever. Maqui berries are high in heart-healthy flavonoids, and research suggests they might help prevent hardening of the arteries, while reducing inflammation in the blood vessels. There's also evidence they help regulate blood sugar levels. Sprinkle a teaspoon of maqui berry powder into oatmeal or quinoa, or add it to juice, smoothies, or sparkling water.Mulberries  Maybe you've chowed down on handfuls of these after pulling them from trees in your backyard. Mulberries are touted as a rich source of heart-healthy polyphenols, and research suggests they help keep your blood vessels healthy. They're also packed with vitamin C, calcium, magnesium, and iron. Plus, one cup of fresh mulberries provides about 270 milligrams of potassium, which is more than the amount in half a banana. Potassium helps counter salt's ability to raise blood pressure, and it also decreases bone loss and reduces the risk of developing kidney stones.Sea Buckthorn Berries  Consider them ""nature's multivitamin,"" Boone says. These tart, yellow-orange berries are high in B-complex vitamins, as well as vitamins A, C, E and K. They're one of the most concentrated sources of vitamin C, which helps boost the immune system, accelerate wound healing and promote the growth and repair of body tissues, according to Boone. They're also full of heart-healthy, cancer-fighting flavonoids, and carotenoids. Try about 2 ounces of sea buckthorn berry juice, and you'll get 40 milligrams of vitamin C, which is about 45 to 55 percent of your daily needs."

When the grill is ready, place slices directly on the grill and grill until grill marks appear and slices are nicely browned, 3 to 4 minutes on each side. Transfer slices back to the jellyroll pan and sprinkle with salt. When slices are cool enough to handle, cut in 1/4"" dices, place in a bowl and set aside.Step 2: When ready to serve (do not prepare these ahead of time as the bread will get soggy), grill the bread slices on both sides until grill marks appear, or place under the broiler until golden-brown. Top each slice with 2 tablespoons of ricotta and spread the cheese evenly over the surface of the bread. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Top with the chopped grilled eggplant. Drizzle with olive oil and garnish with the mint chiffonade. Serve immediately.Cook's note: If you don't have a grill, you can roast the eggplant slices in a 500ºF (260ºC) pre-heated oven for 3 to 4 minutes on each side until the slices are golden-brown."

We've found the eyeshadow color you should be wearing next spring.Backstage at Lela Rose and Costello Tagliapietra's Spring 2014 shows, makeup artists dressed up the models' lids with an unusual shade: lime green. The spring color worked surprisingly well on all the different models' skin tones, however, it stood out particularly on the redheads.With such a vibrant eyeshadow color on the lids, it is key to keep the rest of the face pared down. Romy Soleimani for Beauty.com achieved this at Lela Rose by using a combination of Stila Color Pigments in Light Show and Cha Cha Eyeshadow on the eyes. Then she balanced it with Color Balm Lipstick in Betsey (a creamy pink).MAC Cosmetics lead makeup artist Maki perfected a ""natural and breathable"" look on the Costello Tagliapietra girls by working MAC Pro Sculpting Creams underneath the cheekbones and opting for Lofty Brown Zoom Lash Mascara instead of traditional black. She finished by blending MAC Pro Lime Eye Shadow over the upper and lower eyelids to get a soft wash color.These makeup techniques not only brought out the golden undertones in the redhead models' complexions (which gave them a subtle glow), but it also accentuated the fiery hues in their hair color.
