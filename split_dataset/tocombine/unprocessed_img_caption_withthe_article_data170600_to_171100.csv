It overturned his 15-month suspended prison sentence.""During 12 years, we have wrongly accused an airline. The trial concluded today and finally we have the truth,"" said Continental's lawyer Olivier Metzner.Continental, now part of United Continental Holdings , had been ordered under the original ruling to pay 70 percent of any damages payable to families of the victims. Airbus parent EADS - the successor to Aerospatiale, the French half of the Concorde manufacturer - would have to pay the other 30 percent.The crash sped up the demise of the droop-nosed Concorde - the fastest commercial airliner in history and a symbol of Franco-British co-operation - as safety concerns coupled with an economic downturn after the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001 drove away its wealthy customers.The Air France Concorde, carrying mostly German tourists bound for a Caribbean cruise, was taking off from Paris on July 25, 2000, when an engine caught fire.Trailing a plume of flames, it crashed into a hotel near Charles de Gaulle airport. All 109 passengers and four people on the ground died.After modifications, the plane returned to service but its operators, Air France and British Airways, retired it in 2003, citing high operating costs and a drop in demand.Thursday's ruling found that Concorde had been left in service for too long due to ""political pressure"" surrounding the prestigious but unprofitable aircraft. It did not provide further details.Concorde's wings and the landing gear were never modified despite a string of incidents in the 1980s and 1990s, it said."

While Dad appreciated those gifts because they came from his kids, nowadays it seems there are so many options. Kids can definitely do better -- with a little help from you. Here are some gift ideas for Dad that I think he'll not only appreciate, but he'll love and use!For the Cook More than two-thirds of today's dads share their family's cooking duties, so a useful gift kids can give their old man is a fun spatula he can use to flip burgers and flapjacks. Among the many creative spatulas to be found are ones shaped like electric guitars, Darth Vader and Marvel superheroes like Spiderman and Captain America. Have a flour-dusted dad who loves to bake? There are also Marvel and Star Wars themed cake pans and cookie cutters that he'll probably geek out over. For the Music Lover Dads who play music will be thrilled to receive a pack of personalized guitar picks. This is an especially great gift for kids to give because they can be involved in the creation. In addition to choosing a favorite photo of themselves to go on the front of the pick, kids can compose a short message (like ""Annie loves Dad!"") to go on the back. For something a little fancier, kids can give a brass pick with a personalized message. These make for a beautiful keepsake regardless of whether he plays the guitar or not. For the Sports Fan Dads have long since bonded with their kids over sports, so why not have your kids give their dad a gift they can share? One adorable option is matching baseball jerseys personalized with their last name on the back and their first names on the front. Another terrific option is for a child to give dad an adjustable basketball hoop. He'll love being able to lower the hoop to play with his kids, and then raise it to the regulation height to play with his buddies. For the Outdoorsman One of the sweetest gifts kids can give their dad is a tree-to-be kit. The kit comes with everything needed to grow a tree in your backyard, and it makes for a wonderful activity your kids can share with their dad as they nurture a seedling into their own tulip or apple tree. For Dads Who Love Gifts Made by Their Kids Homemade gifts are not only wonderful options when money is tight, but I also think they warm the heart more than any other. There are many great resources for homemade gift ideas to be found online, including these from Martha Stewart, but my favorite, from the blog eighteen25, is making a ""Book For Dad."" This instructional gives you a free download that asks kids to draw a picture of their dad and explain what they love most about him. These books look great when the pages are slid into a 4x6 photo book and finished off with washi tape, ribbon, or patterned paper.About Women & Co.: Women & Co.®, a service of Citibank, is the go-to personal finance source for women.

Some 10 percent of children aged between five and 16 in Britain are assessed as having a mental disorder of some kind.Adolescence is also a critical period for the development of major depression - an illness that exacts a heavy toll on people and economies worldwide with patients unable to hold down jobs or needing repeated long stretches of time off work.The World Health Organisation says more than 350 million people worldwide have depression and predicts that by 2020, the disorder will rival heart disease as the illness with the highest global disease burden.Sahakian said testing children at school age could help health authorities get in early and offer therapy to prevent people descending into more serious, hard to treat conditions. DETECT RISK EARLY""When you think that the burden of mental illness is more than cancer, more than heart disease - so why on earth don't we try to do something more proactive,"" Sahakian told Reuters after presenting her results at a briefing in London. ""Why are we not doing anything to pick it up early? To me it's a no-brainer"".Goodyer's and Sahakian's test, details of which were published in the PLOS ONE journal, involves a computer assessment designed to gauge how teenagers process emotional information. It includes asking whether certain words, such as ""joyful"", ""failure"" or ""range"", are positive, negative or neutral.For their initial study, 15- to 18-year-olds also underwent genetic testing - an exercise that would be too expensive for routine use but which validated a connection between genes and upbringing in determining mental health risks.The researchers found that adolescents who had a variation of a certain gene linked to the brain chemical serotonin and who had also experienced regular family arguments and parental rows for longer than six months before the age of six, had significant difficulty evaluating the emotion in the words.This, said Goodyer, suggested those children suffered from an inability to process emotional information - a factor which previous studies have established is linked to a significantly increased risk of depression and anxiety.""The evidence is that both our genes and our early childhood experiences contribute,"" said Goodyer. ""Before there are any clinical symptoms of depression or anxiety, this test reveals a deficient ability to ... perceive emotion processes ... which may lead to mental illnesses.""Experts are concerned about the early onset of mental disorders - a factor they say many policy makers and members of the public have not yet grasped.Hans Ulrich Wittchen, a psychologist at Germany's University of Dresden, said in a major European study of mental illness last year that he too thought governments should consider screening adolescents to try to reduce the number who go on to suffer major and recurring bouts of depression.But other mental health experts advised caution.""Early screening in the service of early intervention to try to prevent later mental health problems undoubtedly has allure,"" said Felicity Callard of London's Institute of Psychiatry.""But to grow up with the knowledge that you are 'at high risk' of future mental health problems can affect the very way in which you grow up - and thereby ... embed a sense that you are mentally vulnerable, with potentially untoward consequences.""

Ph.D., Author, Consultant, Speaker",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/playing_us_5b9c8da3e4b03a1dcc7fbd35,Having fun as a parent does not have to cost you anything. You don't need anything but your creative imagination.,2012-11-28,"Portrait of happy family at home. Baby boy ( 1 year old ) and young parents father and mother sitting on floor and playing together at children's room, smiling.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c8da33c00004c0009ce0b.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Family life today is stressful and a bit too serious. Increased emphasis at school on developing academic skills at younger and younger ages means children have less time to play. That's all the more reason why families need to make time to play together. It can change parenting from feeling like a job to a feeling like a true joy! Children play in many ways and each way is beneficial to their overall development. Parents can add to their children's playfulness by being flexible, spontaneous and adding to the fun as it fits. Recently, I watched a young mom play simple games with her child while they were waiting for food at a café; another time, I saw a dad add a few action figures to the construction his son was making, and they played easily together with the figures in and out of the newly created fort. Parenting is full of diverse moments, some of which can be stressful, but mostly it's challenging. It requires your total attention, but it can also be a lot of fun. While you wear many hats as a parent -- giving care, preparing food and being involved in the overall well-being of your family -- you also want to have as much fun as possible with your children. The fun moments with laughter and giggles are those moments that you both remember for a long time. Yes! Parenting can be filled with many spontaneous fun moments. So despite the work and family pressures, let's try to remember that childhood is but a short time during which we need to influence the growth and development -- and also the personality and attitude -- of our children. My playful friend Bernie DeKoven, also known as ""Major Fun,"" shared the following:If parents are actually interested in having more spontaneous fun with their kids, in expanding playtime and play experiences with and without props, then the best thing for them to do is let their kids show them how. Kids are the real experts in all these things -- in spontaneity, in play with and without props. As adults, we still have that expertise, but we have had so few opportunities to exercise it that we need help remembering. The key, if we are looking for one, is playfulness, playing playfully -- letting rules change as they need to, letting games evolve as they need to. The key is not to take the game or the play seriously, but to take the opportunity to be with your kids completely and totally to heart."" There are moments when you want to lighten things up and bring a smile to your child's face, especially if you are feeling a change of pace is needed. Easy! Make a funny face! See what happens as your child responds, giggles and makes you laugh, too. Find space each day for some fun time that provides transitions between what has to be done. Singing a nonsense song or anything always is perfect. Create free playtime in between the chores and, if possible, make the chores more fun by singing, talking gibberish, laughing and making chores seem like a game. Playing ""Peek-a-Boo!"" is easy when your little one is just a few months old and always enjoys spontaneous surprises. You can continue to play surprising, improvisational games from time to time and you can count on always getting a good response. You will also find board and card games and the new cooperative games delightful to your child. Having fun as a parent does not have to cost you anything. You don't need anything but your creative imagination. When you are with your child be totally focused, and please take the time to play together. Do not get distracted with cell phones or TV. When you add a few props from time to time you have an endless supply of good humor and joyful experiences together. Just Be Yourself First, just use yourself to have fun no matter where you are, especially if there is a reason to change the mood. Be ready to create change. You need only your imagination and willingness to try spontaneity.Singing: You don't have to have a great voice, just sing what you know. Your child will sing along to a few rounds of ""Row, row, row your boat,"" or ""Skip to My Lou,"" and the giggles will start. Gibberish: Make up words, phrases and different expressions and you will soon both be laughing. Funny Faces: Easy to do, and you don't need a mirror to see the joy on your child's face. Add hand gestures -- sometimes hands speak better than words to express a move, a pose, or a feeling that they find funny, too. Walking: Games are easy to play when walking outside. Try ""Don't Step on the Crack,"" ""I Spy"" and ""20 Questions."" If you live on a busy street or in an apartment that overlooks major traffic, you can play, ""Who sees the first red car, or who sees a school bus, ambulance, fire truck or dump truck or who sees someone walking a baby carriage, or carrying an umbrella?"" Games like these are endless, always fun and provide practice of observation skills. Add in Simple Props Props are easy, simple devices that increase the fun and allow for even more enjoyable playtime. Mostly, they don't have to cost very much for a lot of fun to happen.

Severity ranges from name-calling to threats to actual violence. We are all familiar with blatant bullying, such as the case of bus monitor Karen Klein of Upstate New York, who was bullied on the school bus. But bullying has many forms. Physical, psychological and cyberbullying get a lot of media attention. Money bullying is less sensational, but no less real.What is ""money bullying?"" There has been little or no discussion on this topic, so I coined the phrase in an effort to focus attention on the problem. We all know about kids being teased if they don't have the latest clothes or if they don't live in the most desirable part of town, but there is another side that goes mostly unnoticed. ""Money bullying"" is harassment about a perceived elevated socio-economic level -- exerting pressure to pay for activities and goods. ""Your parents are rich -- you buy lunch.""I worked with a middle class couple with a son who was a senior in high school. Both parents worked -- the husband even held a second job. The son had a weekend job which enabled him to pay for the insurance and gas on his hand-me-down car. They had a nice house in a nice neighborhood, for which they worked very hard. They were living the ""American Dream.""The couple noticed that their kid was making excessive debits from their joint bank account. The son also asked to borrow gas money a couple of weeks in a row. They were increasingly concerned that something was wrong. When a credit card bill arrived showing that their son had charged a pricey meal at an expensive local restaurant on his ""emergency only"" credit card, the unusual spending had to be addressed. It was time for a family meeting and they asked me to join them. The boy had been raised on my allowance system and had always been very responsible. The parents asked where he was spending the money and in particular about that pricey dinner he had charged. He was hesitant to answer, at first shrugging it off with ""I don't know -- movies and stuff, I guess."" To which his parents replied, ""That's a lot of money for 'movies and stuff.' Are you being a 'big shot' and paying for all your friends?""Finally, the boy admitted that his friends had been pressuring him to pay for things. ""They ask me to go to the movies with them since I have the car and I have a job -- so we go and I end up paying.""I asked the if, indeed, it made him feel like a ""big shot"" to pay for his friends. ""No!"" He quickly answered -- ""But they make me feel guilty when I say 'no'."" As an afterthought, he added -- ""Sometimes I wonder if they would be my friends if I didn't have a car.""I taught him how to deal with his money bullies. Here are 5 tools to help you and your children:1. Talk to your kids about money bullying and how to recognize it.2. Choose your words carefully. Be clear and concise. Don't get into a debate of ""what's right or wrong."" There's nothing wrong with treating a friend once in a while -- if it's your choice.3. Give examples of simple things he can say to his friends and role-play with him. If you are well-off and do give your kids money, they could say, ""It's my parent's money, not mine."" Or, if your child is working and has his own spending money, they could say,""I'll be going to college soon -- I'm on a strict budget so I can help with college costs.""4. Explain that standing up for himself will give him a sense of empowerment. Discuss his feelings. Fear of losing friends is real, but true friends like you for who you are and not for the things you can give them. Take back control of your spending choices.  5. Offer alternate activities that everyone can afford. Instead of taking your friends out to the movies, suggest that you rent a DVD and watch it at home. Go out for an inexpensive meal when you can each afford to pay your own way -- how about pizza night? No matter which form it takes, bullying is hurtful and wrong. We never think of people who are well-off as having any problems. Also, even adults can be faced with money bullies -- knowing how to stand up for one's self will help reestablish a sense of self-control and self-worth. Do you have a money bullying story?
