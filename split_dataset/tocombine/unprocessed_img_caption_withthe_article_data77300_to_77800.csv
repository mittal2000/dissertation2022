0,POLITICS,Iran is Offering to Resolve Yemen's War; The Agenda?,"Dr. Majid Rafizadeh, ContributorPresident of the International American Council",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/iran-is-offering-to-resol_b_8200914.html,"Iranian officials' rhetoric and tone on the Yemen crisis has slightly changed.

This change was initiated because of the shift in Iran's foreign policy regarding how to use ""diplomacy"" and the appropriate wording in order to achieve Tehran's ideological, geopolitical and economic objectives. Surprisingly, according to BBC Persian, this week Hossein Amir Abdollahian, the Deputy Foreign Minister for Arab and African Affairs in Iran's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has offered his country's assistance to other Arab states for ""getting out of the crisis in Yemen.""Since the Yemen crisis began and through last week, Iranian officials, including the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei, and Iranian state-controlled media outlets launched their rhetoric war against other nations, several Arab countries- particularly anti-Saudi rhetoric. They are being criticized for their involvement in Yemen. What is intriguing about Tehran's attitude is that the Islamic Republic views other countries' engagement in Yemen- even those that share borders with Yemen and have justifiable security reasons to be concerned about the Yemen conflict- as interventions, irrelevant, and intrusive. Simultaneously, Iran sees its role in Yemen as justifiable even though it does not share a border with Yemen and Yemen's conflict does not pose any security threat whatsoever to Tehran. Iran sees the Yemen conflict as Tehran's struggle to tip the regional balance of power in its favor, promoting its ideological and sectarian values, and demonstrating its regional supremacy over other Arab states in the gulf. Nevertheless, why is there a sudden diplomatic offer coming from Tehran?Iranian Leaders Are Biting Off More Than They Can Chew Iran goes to great lengths to present an image of economic power, however in reality Iranian leaders are hemorrhaging billions of dollars, with the approval of Mr. Khamenei, to maintain their proxies fighting and to keep two other governments in power; in Syria and Iraq. For many years, the geopolitical, strategic, ideological and economic benefits of creating Shiite proxies across the region exceeded the financial, military and weaponry expenses that Tehran spent on its allies. The trend has changed for the Islamic Republic. Iran's foreign policies of supporting Shiite proxies and governments led to excesses and unintended consequences. Iran found itself and its proxies and allies fighting in several full-fledged wars and Tehran found itself spending billions of dollars more in its efforts to support its proxies and allies who fought against its strategic rivals. Iranian leaders are bleeding economically and militarily due to Iran's underlying ideological values, its unintended consequences, and Tehran's foreign policy standards: search for regional preeminence and supremacy, support for proxies, and Tehran's ideological and hegemonic ambitions . What is worse for Tehran is that, this economic and military bleeding (in Syria, Iraq, Yemen, Bahrain, Lebanon, etc.) does not appear to be stopping anytime soon. As a result, Iran is desperately pleading and manipulating, using words and rhetoric in an attempt to save its budget and military manpower. We should remember that Iran's rhetoric and words worked to solidify the nuclear deal. But do all of these words mean that Iran is going to actually alter its foreign policy toward Yemen and the Houthis?Iran's Proxies: Iran Wants to Have their Cake and Eat it TooIran's Supreme Leader and the senior cardre of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) are so shackled into the underlying ideological and deep-rooted institutional values of the Islamic Republic that they will not, and can not, alter their position of supporting the Houthis. They also can not retract their support from other Shiite proxies and governments in the region. Ironically, halting financial, advisory, intelligence, and political support to these proxies and governments could save Iranian leaders billions of dollars. If Tehran lessens its support to those proxies and states, they will be forced to make concessions and consequently the conflict will cease because as long as the Houthis and other proxies believe that the Islamic Republic is behind them, they have no incentive to stop the war. Hence, Iran will benefit economically if it changes its foreign policies. But the underlying issue is that Tehran is so deeply entrenched in the well-established and instituted ideological, sectarian (Sunni vs Shia), and ethnic (Persians vs Arabs) norms that it is impossible for the government and Iranian leaders to change the character of the state. Iran's ideological norms which are pervasive throughout the country includes the struggle to tip the regional balance of power against Arab states in the Gulf, which is an indispensable element and pillar of the Islamic Republic, primarily the Supreme Leader and IRGC. The other reason behind Iran's change of rhetoric is related to Tehran's tactical shift in using verbal manipulation and ""diplomacy"" in order to achieve its ideological, geopolitical and economic objectives. After experiencing the success of the nuclear deal, Iranian leaders have learned that smiley faces and wielding a diplomatic tone assisted them in paving the way to receive billions of dollars and have some of the crippling economic sanctions on their country lifted.In closing, from the Iranian leaders' perspective, a new rhetoric, tactical shift and different choice of words on Yemen might assist them in their attempt to save billions of dollars while simultaneously maintaining Tehran's proxy. As a result Iran could become more empowered in Yemen, and give Tehran a victory in Yemen, all while leaving Iran's underlying foreign policy objectives, ideological principles and regional hegemonic ambitions intact.

The Jets are feeling good with their season starting off at 2-0, and they play host to a reeling Philadelphia Eagles team that has begun the year at 0-2. The Eagles have not looked good, making fans and experts begin to question the multiple moves that Chip Kelly made during the off-season.The wins have come with some consequences. Eric Decker, Chris Ivory, and Darrelle Revis all enter this weekend as questionable with injuries. All three are game time decisions, per head coach Todd Bowles.Here are some keys to victory for the Jets on Sunday:Brandon Marshall will be counted on for a huge game. He has been huge for the Jets so far, with 13 receptions for 163 yards and two touchdowns. He literally carried the team to the game-clinching touchdown last week. He will see a lot of Byron Maxwell on Sunday. With Eric Decker banged up, Marshall winning the matchup against Maxwell is going to make a huge difference.The Jets are going to have to use the short passing game to open up the run. Chris Ivory is banged up with a hamstring and quad injury. So far, the Eagles have only allowed 3.1 yards per carry on the ground, and no rushing touchdowns so far. Conversely, teams are completing 70% of their passes against the Eagles, averaged 270 yards passing per game, and posted a 98.0 passer rating. Clearly, they are vulnerable.Ryan Fitzpatrick is completing almost 64% of his passes so far for the Jets. All Jets fans will agree, this is efficiency the team hasn't seen in quite some time. Use the pass to set up the run. The Jets have the ability to do it, finally.On defense, make Sam Bradford beat you. Yes, the Eagles have a lot of weapons, and move at a frenetic speed. The Eagles, however, also has not been able to run the football, averaging a mere 1.9 yards per carry, and that is with the defending NFL rushing champion DeMarco Murray in the fold. The Jets can pressure this offense, having forced ten turnovers so far in 2015. Sam Bradford has already thrown four interceptions. The Jets' front seven can stop this running game, and can force it to the pass. Bradford does not take care of the football, and he can be turned over. Stop the run, and force Sam Bradford to get it done, and the Jets have a good shot at heading to a 3-0 start.Those are my keys to the game. Jets' fans, what are your keys to the game?"

Nicknamed “Junior,” Krahn is now taller than anyone in NFL history, lineman or not. But with his size-18 shoes in tow, Krahn is trying to prove to scouts that he has more value on the field than merely his physical strength.The high school senior has already been through his fair share of trials in the sport. According to a 2014 Press Enterprise article, Krahn was suspended twice in his junior season for altercations during play. And, when he was first learning the game, he managed to break a teammate’s arm during practice just by falling on him.But having played in front of college coaches this past summer at USA Football's National Development Games, Krahn has learned what it will take to earn a spot at a Division I school. He has to lose weight -- a goal he is striving for both to help his current team and his future prospects, per MaxPreps.Krahn will take on a lean-protein diet -- consisting mainly of chicken and fish -- in the hope of shedding some pounds, and thus improving his footwork and agility. If he's able to combine newfound dexterity with his existing power and strength, Division I coaches may just begin to scramble to woo “Junior,” whose physical prowess would be a boon for any collegiate roster.Also on HuffPost:"
3,POLITICS,Group Supporting Joe Biden Amps Up Hiring In Hopes Of 2016 Run,"Emily Flitter, Reuters",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/joe-biden-2016_us_56058f67e4b0dd8503076c68,They're staffing up in key primary states.,2015-09-25,"Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) -- Announced March 23, 2015",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55b7e4ec1d00003000143032.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale,"A group of Joe Biden supporters trying to build momentum for a White House run by the vice president is hiring paid staff in about a dozen crucial primary states.The political action committee backing the vice president, Draft Biden, has begun building operations in 11 states holding primary elections on ""Super Tuesday"" in March 2016, two of the group's officials told Reuters, an important series of votes for any candidate seeking their party’s nomination.Draft Biden doesn't have a firm number for how many staff in total it will hire in those states, said Josh Alcorn, a senior advisor to the group, but the recruitment process is under way.Whatever the number, adding paid staffers in the 11 states suggests a growing confidence within Draft Biden that Biden will mount a challenge to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, the front runners for the Democratic presidential nomination.The expansion means Biden would have a far broader and more sophisticated infrastructure than previously known should he decide to enter the race.Alcorn said Draft Biden is also adding paid staff in Florida, where the primary is held two weeks after Super Tuesday.Until recently, the Super PAC had concentrated on establishing operations in the four earliest primary states - Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. It has about a dozen employees in those states.Biden, 72, who is still coping with his son Beau’s death earlier this year, has said he is not sure whether he is up to the demands of the presidential contest.Still, he has huddled with advisors and met with Democratic Party luminaries such as Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a darling of liberal Democrats for her staunch opposition to some of the risk-taking by Wall Street banks.Some of Biden's supporters hope he will make up his mind before CNN's Oct. 13 debate for Democratic candidates.Alcorn declined to say how much Draft Biden would spend on hiring staff in the Super Tuesday states: Alabama, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont and Virginia.He also would not say how much money the group had raised so far, but ""we're well on our way to reaching our $2.5 million-$3 million goal before he enters the race.""NARROWING THE GAPThe Draft Biden Super PAC can raise unlimited amounts of money, but federal rules prohibit it from coordinating directly with Biden's official election campaign, should he run.The Super PAC's top brass say they don't plan to join any campaign but staff on the ground in each state could do so.""My hope is that if he decides to get into the race all these volunteers that are helping us will basically abandon us and go help him,"" said Steve Schale, a Democratic political operative who is leading Draft Biden's operations in Florida.Clinton and Sanders are leading Biden in early polls: About 16 percent of Democrats in a Reuters/Ipsos poll said they would vote for him, while 47 percent favored Clinton and 26 percent Sanders.Both also have a significant head start in campaigning, but Biden's supporters believe sharply expanding staff in the Super Tuesday states would quickly narrow that gap. Neither Clinton nor Sanders has yet hired paid staff in every Super Tuesday state, said a Sanders spokesman and a Democratic strategist close to Clinton who did not want to be named.The Clinton strategist was skeptical about Draft Biden's hiring plans. ""I'm not sure they understand just how far behind they really are.""Also on HuffPost:"

Eric Cantor (R-Va.) learned on Friday that at one point, while serving as House majority leader, he'd been on the cusp of achieving his life goal to become the first Jewish speaker of the House in U.S. history.Two years ago, HuffPost reported, citing sources close to Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio), that the speaker planned to step down after the 2014 elections. Boehner's office denied the report. And sure enough, he went on to serve in the speaker's post well into 2015.On Friday morning, however, Boehner abruptly announced that he would be resigning from Congress by the end of October. And in a statement, a Boehner aide confirmed that he had already stayed on nine months longer than he'd originally planned.""The Speaker’s plan was to serve only through the end of last year. Leader Cantor’s loss in his primary changed that calculation,"" said the Boehner aide.Cantor's 2014 primary loss was not just a remarkable political turn of events, but a complete twist of history. The Virginia Republican, who had served as second in command in the Republican-controlled House, was stunned in his primary election campaign and decided to leave Congress altogether before his term was up. With no heir apparent, Boehner decided to stick around. But the clear implication from Boehner's aide was that the original plan had been to usher Cantor into the speaker's role at the turn of the year.The Jews, indeed, have struck out again. Former Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) had aspirations of being the first Jewish speaker, but he downsized his career goals in 1987 when he publicly revealed that he was gay. Former Rep. Rahm Emanuel (D-Ill.) likewise looked at one point like he could become the first Jewish speaker. But he left the House to serve as President Barack Obama's chief of staff and, subsequently, to become mayor of Chicago.A spokesman for Cantor said that he would not be reacting to the Boehner news today."

Inside, a group of third- and fourth-graders showed him school projects they were working on that align with his focus on the environment.Speaking later in the school gym, he shared an inspiring message. ""It is beautiful to have dreams and to be able to fight for them. Today we want to keep dreaming,"" said Francis, evoking the words of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. ""We celebrate all the opportunities which enable you, and us adults, not to lose the hope of a better world with greater possibilities.""The pope noted that many of the students at Our Lady Queen of Angels and three other local Catholic schools represented at the event come from minority and immigrant communities.""I know that it is not easy to have to move and find a new home, new neighbors and new friends,"" the pontiff said. ""The good thing is that we also make new friends. We meet people who open doors for us, who are kind to us. They offer us friendship and understanding, and they try to help us not to feel like strangers. To feel at home.""About 70 percent of the students at Our Lady Queen of Angels identify as Hispanic, while 22 percent identify as African-American. Sixty-nine percent qualify for need-based scholarships, according to The Partnership for Inner-City Education, a school management organization that operates six Catholic schools in Harlem and the South Bronx. After talking with the young children, the pontiff headed into the gym where immigrants and refugees were gathered to hear his message of hope. The men and women -- who hailed from Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, Honduras, India, Pakistan and parts of Africa -- are clients of the archdiocese's Catholic Charities program. Among them were day laborers, car wash workers, immigrant mothers and a group of unaccompanied minors who crossed the border without their parents and helped start a soccer league in the Bronx.Francis received gifts from representatives of different immigrant groups, including a book of stories by diaspora communities in New York City. He had brought Our Lady Queen of Angels a wooden sculpture of the Virgin Mary with an infant Jesus.At the end of his brief address, which he delivered in Spanish, the pope asked his listeners for their help. ""Please don't forget to pray for me, so that I can share with many people the joy of Jesus,"" he said.He also asked them to sing for him. Two different groups of immigrants obliged.Monsignor Kevin Sullivan, executive director of Catholic Charities, said the pope's visit to East Harlem was ""his most important stop."" The school is connected to the now-defunct Our Lady Queen of Angels parish. The church closed down in 2007 as part of the New York archdiocese's reorganization and consolidation, which was prompted by declining attendance and a shortage of priests. A group of former parishioners who still meet outside the church on Sundays hope the pope's visit will bring attention to their efforts to re-open the house of worship.After the East Harlem visit, Francis heads to Madison Square Garden to celebrate Mass. He flies to Philadelphia on Saturday morning, where he will address immigrants gathered at Independence Mall, visit inmates at a local prison and lead two Masses on Benjamin Franklin Parkway. He heads back to Rome on Sunday, Sept. 27.Also on HuffPost:"

He has been in politics for too long, some said, and he is too willing to compromise. He gives up too easily, rather than fighting for conservative values, they said.But there's another person those criticisms apply to: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.). They're not happy with him, either.""Here's what I say in response to Speaker Boehner stepping down: Mitch McConnell, it is now your turn,"" said Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, a GOP presidential hopeful, to a ballroom full of cheering conservatives.""If Senator McConnell is not willing to fight for our conservative principles, he needs to follow John Boehner's example,"" he said.Hundreds of people gathered at a hotel in Washington to hear from GOP candidates, politicians and activists mostly about social issues, such as religious liberty and ending abortion and same-sex marriage. Many of them want Congress to do anything possible to reach those goals, including risking a government shutdown in order to cut off federal funds for Planned Parenthood.Boehner and McConnell, meanwhile, have indicated they will hold votes to keep the government open without tying them to a fight over abortion -- a betrayal to some social conservatives. This month, the senator also drew ire for not changing Senate rules so fewer votes would be needed to pass a bill rejecting the Iran nuclear deal. Conservatives will be able to accomplish much more in 2017 with a Republican president, so they should bide their time until then, he said in a recent interview.Most conservative politicians discussing Boehner's resignation at Friday's event pivoted to talking about Republican leadership in general -- an unmistakable jab at McConnell, although they stopped short of saying he should step down.""I'm disappointed in both houses. I'm disappointed that they haven't done what we sent them here to do,"" said former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, also a GOP presidential contender.""When people sent them here, they didn't send them to give the president more power on Obamacare, immigration and even trade, and certainly not the Iranian deal,"" Huckabee said. ""I know on those four areas alone, the president got more power and Congress didn't exercise much.""Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), another candidate for president, said ""not a darn thing has changed"" since McConnell took over as majority leader earlier this year. He said that whether McConnell should resign is a question for the majority leader himself and the GOP conference -- of which he is a member -- but reiterated that he doesn't think the Kentucky Republican is a very faithful conservative.""I've privately urged them, 'Look, stand up and lead. I will sing your praises,'"" Cruz told journalists before the event. ""I would be thrilled to appear at a press conference and talk about the brave, courageous, principled John Boehner and Mitch McConnell, if they would simply act in a way that I could say that truthfully."" Former Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), also a presidential candidate, criticized leaders who ""are just focused on making the trains run and getting things done, as opposed to standing up for the that things we need to fight for."" But he skirted the question of whether McConnell should resign.""All I can say is that we have an election coming up, and that's where the real change is going to occur,"" Santorum told reporters, before going on to talk about why he should be elected president.Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback (R), who served with McConnell in the Senate for 15 years, declined to say whether he thinks it's time for the majority leader to step down. But he did say that conservatives are looking from more from their leaders.""People are very frustrated with the lack of progress in Washington,"" Brownback said. ""That's why I think the outsiders are all leading in the presidential campaigns. Because it's like, if the guys in there aren't getting it done, I'm going to go somewhere else.""Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) just wants his party to get along already.""We're spending our time attacking each other rather than the adversary, which is obviously the Democrats and Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama,"" McCain told reporters. ""I hope the lesson to all of us is now, 'Let's stop fighting with each other and sit down together and work out our differences with a common agenda to elect the next president of the United States.'"" Conservative attendees were all over the board on whether they think McConnell is the right person to be leading the Senate.""He's more verbal than Boehner. Like more in his way of speaking, he's pressing issues. I like that better than Boehner,"" said Edith Hindle, an elderly woman from Smicksburg, Pennsylvania. ""Leave him where he is.""""He's too moderate for my taste,"" said Timothy O'Neill, a freshman at American University. ""He should step down, as long as someone comes in who is going to be a better conservative, someone who isn't going to roll over to the Obama White House. I think McConnell and Boehner both do that."" He added, ""I really like Marco Rubio. Someone like that should be the leader.""Roger and Nancy Wendt, both 73, were firmly on the anti-McConnell side. The Londonderry, New Hampshire, couple said they want Boehner and McConnell out because both are too focused on politics.""I think [McConnell] should have dropped down a long time ago, too, because he is not for our country,"" said Nancy Wendt, a retired teacher. ""I don't think he is. He's too political.""""He doesn't seem to have a clue what's important,"" added her husband, a retired engineer."
9,SPORTS,Should Darren Sharper Be A Nominee For The Pro Football Hall of Fame?,Erick Fernandez,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/darren-sharper-hall-of-fame_us_5601b303e4b0fde8b0d027ef,The former NFL star has been convicted of drugging and raping multiple women.,2015-09-25,"Outside the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5602fec41c00002d00757c1d.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"His name is there underlined and in capital letters, signifying his first year of eligibility for the Pro Football Hall of Fame, just like 10 other first-time nominees.While his name may not be of much significance to some, the sight of ""DARREN SHARPER (FS)"" might have a different significance for at least nine women in four different states.In April, former All-Pro Saints player Sharper reached a ""global plea agreement"" with the jurisdictions of California, Arizona, Nevada and Louisiana. ""The plea deal hinged on Sharper admitting to sexually assaulting nine women in four states,"" New Orleans' Times-Picayune reported. After the plea agreement was proposed in April, he pleaded guilty in June to two counts of forcible rape and one count of simple rape that reportedly occurred during a 2013 incident. Sharper's official sentencing is expected to be on Oct. 15. Under the plea deal, Sharper would receive a 20-year sentence, but it is possible he would actually be serving about nine years in prison on the condition that he follows the terms of his subsequent ""lifetime probation.""A detailed ProPublica report said Sharper ""drugged many of his victims with powerful amnesiacs, resulting in cloudy or even nonexistent memories."" According to the same ProPublica report, one specific incident in Arizona had a witness account. This woman ""saw Sharper naked, thrusting into the body of the woman who had passed out on the couch."" The witness' friend was unconscious ""within minutes"" of having a shot prepared by Sharper.Yet here he is on that list with prestigious football players including quarterback Brett Favre and wide receiver Terrell Owens. As unlikely as it is that Sharper will be voted in by the 46-person selection committee, should the serial rapist even appear on a list of people who could theoretically join football's most elite group in Canton, Ohio?Sharper is technically eligible for the Hall of Fame -- which has been careful to publicly distinguish itself from the NFL -- because he has been out of the league five full seasons and made at least one All-Pro or Pro Bowl team during his career, the criteria for getting placed on the ballot. He certainly had a Hall of Fame-type career over his 14 years in the league too. The safety was an all-decade player in the 2000s and finished with a total of 63 interceptions, just one less than Ed Reed, a staple of the Baltimore Ravens defense for years.Peter King of Sports Illustrated's MMQB has spoken at length this year about Darren Sharper and the Hall of Fame. He has continuously said that off-the-field matters should not and cannot come into play when nominating and eventually voting in Hall of Fame candidates.The MMQB columnist does have a point. As Deadspin's Drew Magary notes, the lack of a ""character clause,"" which would ask voters to take a player's actions off the field into account, ""prevents voters from grandstanding by omitting certain players from a ballot for supposed moral trespasses.""But should a line ever be drawn? Is a crime ever so deplorable enough that the league and its Hall of Fame should decide to completely dissociate themselves from an individual?The Huffington Post posed that question about a possible line being drawn for future nominees in a phone call to Joe Horrigan, the Executive Vice President of Museums, Selection Process & Chief Communications Officer at the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Horrigan emphasized that he did not want to get into hypothetical situations and said they have gone by the same standards for Hall of Fame eligibility. ""Up to this point, we have not done anything more than to define what makes someone eligible for the Hall of Fame,"" Horrigan told HuffPost. ""Beyond that, we have created no provision to remove anyone or try to set up any other criteria other than the fact that someone is elected to the Hall of Fame based solely upon his career.""And while some Hall of Fame selectors such as Peter King have emphasized they will vote for inductees according to the current standards, another voter acknowledged it would not be that simple. In an interview with ProPublica, Bleacher Report NFL writer and Hall of Fame selector Jason Cole was very candid about his thoughts on Sharper.""Off the field is not supposed to count, but I would feel disgusting if I voted for him,"" Cole said. ""There's a certain point where you can't separate the two. And he crossed that line.""Removing Sharper's name from the list of potential Hall of Fame inductees wouldn't erase Sharper's career for the history books. But it would allow the the Pro Football Hall of Fame to stand in solidarity with Sharper's victims.The organization wouldn't be the first. The former free safety's high school, Hermitage High, decided in March that the convictions far outweighed his accomplishments and removed plaques and other mentions of Sharper's name around the school.Sharper's qualifications, like the the other 107 modern nominees, will be thought over by the Hall of Fame voters. It will be seen whether he receives enough votes to move on to the next round as one of the top 25 semi-finalists for the Hall of Fame in November.Whether he advances or not,  DARREN SHARPER (FS) will continue to be a glaring sight on the Hall of Fame's nominee list during that time, justified or not.

Steve Russell's (R-Okla.) military records after he expressed skepticism about the achievements of the first two women to graduate from the Army's grueling Ranger School.Russell, also a graduate of Ranger School, recently asked the Army to hand over the records of Capt. Kristen Griest and 1st Lt. Shaye Haver in order to check that they were not given favorable treatment and that they truly ""deserved to pass.""""Our office recently received information from some people with the Ranger School who alleged they were not held to the same standards,"" Russell's communications director, Daniel Susskind, told the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer. ""We asked for the records to make sure that all of the people who passed the course deserved to pass it.""Sue Fulton, one of the first women to graduate from West Point, said she thinks Russell should have to prove himself if he's challenging the achievements of Griest and Haver. As Stars and Stripes reported, Fulton filed a Freedom of Information Act request Thursday to view the congressman's Ranger School records on behalf of an informal group of fellow West Point graduates. Fulton called Russell out on Twitter, saying, ""Let's see YOUR Ranger School records, Congressman."" “He, like too many older men, have biases about what women are capable of,” Fulton told Stars and Stripes. Susskind told the Ledger-Enquirer that Russell asked for records of the entire Ranger School graduating class, not only the women. His letter to the Army specifically requests the records of the ""female graduates and those female candidates that entered Ranger School."" Russell, who served in the Army for 21 years, defended his request on Facebook Wednesday, writing that the ""records request on the recent Ranger classes that included females is to investigate serious allegations that are being made by members of the military. ... I asked for the records to determine the nature of the allegations."" Susskind told The Huffington Post that Russell won't comment further until he receives the records and reviews them.Griest and Haver graduated on Aug. 21 with 94 male classmates. "
11,POLITICS,"With John Boehner Gone, It's Time For The House To Drop Its Obamacare Lawsuit",Cristian Farias,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-boehner-obamacare-lawsuit_us_56055face4b0768126fd2e61,We don't need federal courts to referee power disputes between Congress and the president.,2015-09-25,The departure of House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) provides a good opportunity for the House to drop its case against the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5605a32b1900002f00fde6fb.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"The seismic announcement that House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) will resign at the end of October brings a fresh focus on the House's federal lawsuit against the Obama administration over certain funding provisions in the Affordable Care Act.Boehner scored a win earlier this month when U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer allowed the suit to move forward. At the time, he thanked the court for allowing him to challenge President Barack Obama's ""historic overreach"" -- arguing, essentially, that the government usurped Congress' constitutional ""power of the purse"" by spending money lawmakers never approved.That's the bottom line of Boehner's case, and it's a serious charge that litigation could ultimately prove.But Collyer's ruling had nothing to do with that. All it decided was whether the House had ""standing"" to sue another branch of government. Standing is a basic constitutional requirement every litigant must meet, but legal scholars are deeply skeptical that an ""institutional plaintiff"" like the House can do so. Therfore, the government is now seeking an expedited review of Collyer's ruling by a higher court.In court papers filed this week, lawyers for the Obama administration called Collyer's ruling a ""momentous step,"" and argued that letting it go unchallenged would greatly damage the separation of powers, opening the door to a flurry of lawsuits between Congress and the president over political questions -- with federal courts acting as referees.Federal courts should continue to have a restricted role, in order to preserve ""the unbroken practice of resolving those confrontations through the give-and-take of the democratic process rather than by [resorting] to the Judiciary,"" the lawyers argued. The federal government is exactly right. Historically, Congress has been largely barred from suing the president because this could set a precedent for future political battles. It would simply be too easy for one branch to sue the other over every disagreement -- interpretive disputes, policy differences, enforcement priorities, funding the government, you name it.Federal courts, which have very limited jurisdiction by design, would be tasked with the impossible: judge who's right in all sorts of power struggles -- from the petty to the truly consequential. And if, God forbid, they ruled one way and not the other, then all hell would break loose against them. In its filing this week, the Obama administration outlined the parade of disputes that courts could be asked to adjudicate if the House prevails: Congress could sue the president for not appointing judges ""with the advice and consent of the Senate,"" or for overstepping Congress' authority to declare war. Or lawmakers could sue a federal official for receiving a gift or title from a foreign power without congressional approval. Or the Senate could sue the House for adjourning for more than three days without the other's consent. The possibilities are endless.The Supreme Court shot down claims like these years ago.In that case, members of Congress challenged the Line Item Veto Act of 1996 -- later ruled unconstitutional -- because it allowed the president to ""cancel"" certain tax and spending provisions after they'd become law, which essentially robbed lawmakers of their lawmaking authority. Still, the Supreme Court ruled that they couldn't sue. Nicholas Bagley, a law professor at the University of Michigan, may have put it best: If Collyer's ruling is allowed to stand, it ""would mark an unprecedented expansion of judicial authority into interbranch food fights.""And what a food fight this is.These signs point to a bruising loss for the House on the preliminary issue of standing, for which the Obama administration has a very strong claim on appeal. With Boehner on his way out, the House legal team would be wise to do early damage control and drop this ill-advised lawsuit once and for all.  Also on HuffPost:"

This isn’t because women aren’t innately ambitious, the researchers found. The issue is primarily that women have a lot of other stuff they want or need to do.“One reason women may not assume high-level positions in organizations is that they believe, unlike men, that doing so would require them to compromise other important life goals,” professors Francesca Gino and Alison Wood Brooks write in an article for the Harvard Business Review.In nine separate surveys polling a total of 4,000 executives, business school students, undergraduates and a sample of employed adults, women were more likely than men to believe that achieving career power was less desirable and that it conflicted with other life goals -- such as being in a committed relationship, being organized and keeping up with sports. When asked to list their life goals, women had more of them than men.The findings add more context to the complicated stew of explanations for why so few women are in powerful positions. Women hold only 4 percent of CEO jobs at S&P 500 companies, and just 19 percent of board seats. Only 6 percent of venture capital partners are women. And, obviously, there's never been a female president or vice president.The quick reason for this is old-timey sexism: Until very recently, women weren't allowed up the ladder, so it's taking a while for them to make it up to the top. Still, progress has clearly been too slow -- and for that, we can thank unconscious bias:  Women are often viewed as less competent by both sexes, or are punished for acting aggressively or ambitiously, research has shown. Then there’s also the tendency for the men already in power to promote and support other men.A separate body of research tries to pin the problem on women themselves, trying to show that they’re inherently less ambitious or competitive. And at first glance, this new research seems to fit in that category.Not so fast. First, it's tough to tease apart nature and nurture. Women, from a very young age, are socialized to have different life goals than men. Brooks referred The Huffington Post to research from 2013 that showed girls in patriarchal societies become less competitive after puberty, while girls in matrilineal societies don’t.It’s fairly reasonable to conclude that women are trained not to want power. After all -- and of course, I’m generalizing a little -- girls get dolls in wedding dresses and little mini baby strollers; boys get fire trucks and toy dump trucks.All we know from these findings is that women are pulled in more directions than men, and therefore see more negative consequences in taking on a role that comes with more responsibilities. The researchers also found that women didn't feel like they couldn't get high-powered positions, they just saw more downsides to achieving them.And that is perhaps the bigger issue: Even though men are doing more, women are still mainly responsible for taking on housework, child care and, increasingly, elder care. And there's little social support to help them -- no public daycare options, for starters.I know more than a few women who have quit their jobs or scaled down their ambitions because they had children. I know a couple men who’ve sacrificed work for family, too, but they’re not the norm. While women are raised to become caretakers, men are raised to become breadwinners -- so yeah, they want more of the professional power because it leads to all the monies.Also, it's important to remember that there's more to power beyond just getting a fancy job. As the authors write: ""To some, professional success means achieving power over others and making a lot of money. To others, it means being happy at work, making other people happy, or helping others."" Maybe, instead of women wanting more power, men should recalibrate and want a little less.Also on HuffPost:"
