0,POLITICS,Bernie's Political Revolution Gets Its Night,Ryan Grim and Kate Sheppard,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-hillary-dnc-monday_us_5796dcbbe4b0d3568f84577f,Democrats played all their progressive cards on Monday night.,2016-07-26,Supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) listen to him speak during the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on Monday.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5796dcf22400002600b33031.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― This was the best the Democratic Party could do. Democrats on Monday night fired nearly every progressive bullet they had in the chamber, hoping to kill what remains of the Bernie-or-bust movement that threatens to derail the party’s bid for the White House.Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Al Franken, three of the party’s most progressive, populist and popular senators, all took the stage at the Democratic National Convention to make the full-throated case for Hillary Clinton as president ― or, perhaps more importantly, against Donald Trump as president. They were joined by Sen. Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), who had endorsed Sanders and spoke in prime time, and Sanders’ House backers, Raul Grijalva and Keith Ellison, in a night that was ultimately dominated by a blow-the-roof-off speech from Michelle Obama.We’ll see if it was enough. Sanders referenced his own disappointment with the outcome, but cast the situation the party now faces in stark terms: “Hillary Clinton must become the next president of the United States. The choice is not even close.”While acknowledging his significant differences with Clinton, his speech mainly focused on progressive issues they have both elevated in the campaign: college debt, fixing a broken criminal justice system, raising the minimum wage, addressing climate change. And he praised a Democratic Party platform he called “by far the most progressive” in the history of the party.“Our job now is to see that platform implemented by a Democratic Senate, a Democratic House and a Hillary Clinton presidency ― and I am going to do everything I can to make that happen,” he added.The appeal for cohesion came after a Monday of rancor, with supporters of Sanders booing and heckling anybody connected to Clinton they could find, and even booing Sanders for backing her. And in the hall on Monday, chants against the Trans-Pacific Partnership rang out throughout the night, serving as a proxy for the political revolution and doubling as a symbol of the lack of trust many Sanders backers have in Clinton. Clinton has said publicly she opposes TPP in its current form, as has her running mate Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), though both had previously backed it. Sanders delegates, in interviews at the convention, said they are sure Clinton will flip back on the issue as soon as she can.Jessica Bright, from Charleston, South Carolina, said Sanders won her over early in the contest. Her mother, South Carolina state Sen. Margie Bright Matthews, meanwhile, was with Hillary. The pair, who are African American, symbolized the demographic divide that drove the primary contest: While the media often focused on white support for Sanders and black backing for Clinton, the more profound division was really between young and old voters.But as the younger Bright watched Donald Trump rise in the polls and begin to dispatch his rivals in the Republican primary, she decided she couldn’t risk a Trump presidency. She didn’t tell her mother of her change of heart until after the election. On Monday, both sat in South Carolina’s section as delegates for Clinton.Bright, who said she’s still a Sanders supporter at heart, noticed the booing from Sanders fans fading throughout the day, particularly as more and more people of color took the stage. “They had to be heard for a second, but ... once you hear from someone who comes from your struggle,” she said, “it makes you see it differently.”Nearby, Lakewood, Colorado, delegate Kim Netherton was passionately expressing her frustration at the process. “I still think he could win,” she said. “They keep talking about the nomination in the past tense. It’s not over.”Ultimately conceding that it was unlikely Sanders would pull out a win at the convention, she said the party was needlessly risking losing to Trump, pointing to Sanders’ higher approval ratings and better head-to-head polling against Trump. “He appeals to independents. She doesn’t,” she said. “The only thing the GOP campaign can unite behind is their hatred of her. She’s the only thing that unites them, and that’s insanely dangerous, because their nominee is a fascist.”Outside, Sanders supporters chanted, “A vote for Hillary is a vote for Trump.”Perhaps oddly, that’s an analysis shared by a growing number of Republican operatives, who say their party has collapsed structurally but is being held together only by the intense hatred of Clinton. “If Biden jumped in, he’d win 50 states,” said one former Bush official, slightly exaggerating. “I think Dems misunderstand how much Republicans hate her. If she were off the ticket the GOP would fall apart.”Warren, Franken and Sanders took different routes to the stage. Warren resisted the call of a grassroots effort to persuade her to run against Clinton, and then resisted pressure to endorse Sanders, staying neutral instead. Franken, meanwhile, threw his weight behind Clinton. (Though even without Franken’s backing, Sanders cruised to victory in the Minnesota caucus.)Warren remains intensely popular among the progressive base, though a chunk of Sanders supporters still hold her responsible for not joining Bernie’s political revolution when it may have mattered. Sanders lost Massachusetts by less than 20,000 votes. Warren had to follow Michelle Obama, and delivered an underwhelming speech. “Where was Elizabeth Warren in the primaries?” one Sanders backer called out loudly. Having not endorsed Sanders, her speech on behalf of Clinton was less impressive than it would have been otherwise. Polls show that the overwhelming number of Sanders supporters have moved over to the Hillary camp, but the scene that greeted Sanders delegates in Philadelphia wasn’t heartening for many. A Politico article on Monday set the scene: Hordes of industry executives will descend on the city to celebrate Hillary Clinton’s nomination for president and renew close associations that vexed the Democratic standard-bearer throughout her primary battle with Bernie Sanders.It wasn’t all love for the Bernie crowd, though. Michelle Obama pointedly praised Clinton for rallying behind Barack Obama in 2008 and even joining his administration rather than cynically sitting it out, a reference to holdout Sanders backers that wasn’t missed: “Hillary knows this is so much bigger than her own desires and disappointments.”Sarah Silverman, who reminded the crowd she’d previously been feeling the Bern, delivered the speech that, besides those by Michelle Obama and Sanders himself, was met with the greatest enthusiasm. Once it was over, Paul Simon wasn’t yet ready to come on stage, so Silverman and Franken were told to “stretch” to fill the time. So Silverman added: “To the Bernie-or-bust voters: You’re being ridiculous.” The crowd roared. Sanders finally emerged just before 11 p.m. to a raucous ovation and a sea of teal “Bernie” signs. Some tears flowed, and when he mentioned Hillary Clinton, there were more than a few boos, but fewer each time he referred to her. By his closing remarks, the boos had all but been drowned out. But not completely."

Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.) stepped down as Democratic National Committee chair on the eve of the party's convention.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579662431200002a00a5353a.jpeg?cache=TwS3JmDwXp&ops=crop_0_376_3000_1620%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― Many staffers inside the Democratic National Committee breathed a sigh of relief Sunday when news broke that their boss, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Fla.), would be stepping down.Current and former officials who spoke with The Huffington Post say that the organization has become a shell of itself, too focused on defending and promoting the chair, rather than promoting the interests of the Democratic Party. And they hope that with a new leader, they’ll have a fresh start to rebuild for the 2016 elections.Staffers said morale at the DNC had dropped as a result of management decisions, constant scrutiny from activists and a feeling that in this cycle, the organization was essentially left in the dust ― not trusted by Hillary Clinton’s campaign to handle messaging and not in the mix on key fights. And with Wasserman Schultz increasingly the story, they weren’t able to focus on their core work of holding Republicans accountable.“It became clear that there were a number of folks in the organization that were working for the benefit of the chair and not the benefit of the committee or the party or the campaign,” said one DNC staffer who, like others, requested anonymity to speak openly.“The culture just became poisonous. It became hard to come in every day,” a former staffer added.The catalyst for Wasserman Schultz’s resignation Sunday, on the eve of the Democratic National Convention, were leaks of DNC staffers’ emails that seemed to show the party working to help get Clinton elected ― even though the party was supposed to be neutral in the primary.But dissatisfaction with Wasserman Schultz had been growing for months. The chair became a lightning rod for criticism from Sen. Bernie Sanders’ (I-Vt.) supporters, who long believed she was tipping the scales for Clinton.“I promise you that every person this week talking crap about Debbie has an ulterior motive,” said a Democratic official who took issue with much of the criticism directed at the chair and the DNC. Even her critics acknowledge that she was often a scapegoat and much of what people went after her for was pinned on her unfairly. But they also say she frequently imposed self-inflicted wounds that only fueled her critics. And Sanders supporters sensed this weakness, constantly provoking Wasserman Schultz and going after her by name. One example is the way that she dealt with Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii). Gabbard, who was a vice chair of the DNC, became one of the most vocal officials calling for more primary debates. Wasserman Schultz responded by telling her that she was essentially disinvited from the first face-off if she didn’t stop criticizing the DNC. The move provoked Gabbard, resulting in her becoming a constant critic of the Democratic Party, and a few months later, she resigned from her position with the DNC.“If anybody knows Tulsi, they know that’s absolutely the wrong way to go about it ― and Tulsi proved that point,” another former DNC official said.“Debbie has an uncanny ability to, unprovoked, turn herself into a villain,” the official added.Internally, things for Wasserman Schultz were also boiling over ― a situation perhaps best exemplified by what was happening in the communications department.From early June to mid-September last year, the DNC went without a communications director, a misstep that frustrated Democratic officials. Former DNC staffers said at the time that it was hard to guide the Democratic Party without a messaging strategy and, to do that, someone needed to be at the helm.One reason for the delay was that Wasserman Schultz refused to hire someone she did not know of personally or hadn’t met in person, and she rejected several candidates suggested by allies of Clinton and President Barack Obama. Wasserman Schultz’s eventual choice, Luis Miranda, quickly ruffled feathers when he came on board. Current and former staffers in the department say they moved away from the rapid response they had focused on during the GOP primary and spent more time promoting Wasserman Schultz’s brand and booking her on TV. At least five communications staffers ended up leaving. Part of it was the usual culture clash when a new boss takes over and priorities shift. But part of it was also that Wasserman Schultz seemed to have lost some of the loyalty of her staff, who wanted to turn their focus elsewhere. Another part of the problem was the feeling, both inside and out, that Wasserman Schultz was no longer an effective spokesperson for the party. After all, it’s no secret that Washington politicians want to be on TV more ― that’s always part of the job, and it’s not unique to Wasserman Schultz. But there was a tension: As chair of the party she needed to get out there, but she was no longer the best person to do it because she had a target on her back. “She would complain she wasn’t on TV more, but no one wanted her on TV more,” a former DNC staffer said.Wasserman Schultz’s critics also admit that all of the dysfunction is not her fault and that there has been some progress. The digital team, for example, has quintupled in size since 2013, and the organization as a whole has put a focus on reaching out to state parties to build up their operations as a continuation of the 50-state strategy.The Obama campaign saw the DNC as a tool to aid the president’s re-election, and officials had little interest in building the party infrastructure. Instead, they built Organizing for Action, which essentially became a parallel organization and pulled away resources. Wasserman Schultz took over as chair in 2011. Even from the beginning, there were clashes with Obama officials when she tried to make decisions without getting their sign-off. For example, shortly into her tenure, she tried to create a women’s committee at the DNC. But when Obama campaign manager Jim Messina heard about the idea, he applied the brakes, arguing that it would confuse donors and messaging, since the campaign already had a women’s committee of its own. Over time, Wasserman Schultz did gain more control of the DNC ― in part because the White House wasn’t paying attention to the organization ― and the mix of her people versus the Obama holdovers led to some of the tensions. And although top officials in the Clinton campaign, the White House and Congress have wanted Wasserman Schultz out for quite some time, no one wanted to deal with the headache. “It came down to the fact that the president didn’t want the hassle of getting rid of Debbie,” a former top Obama adviser told Politico. “It’s been a huge problem for the Clintons, but the president just didn’t want the headache of Debbie bad-mouthing him. ... It was a huge pain in the ass.”“The DNC team is focused on winning an election and all of the rest of this scuttlebutt is not relevant for the lives of the hardworking Americans Democrats fight for every day,” a DNC spokesperson said. Many in the Democratic Party apparatus are looking forward to the return of the Clintons, who have always been known as “party people.” The DNC was a far more integral part of their operation in the 1990s than it was under Obama, and Clinton herself has promised to strengthen the party infrastructure. Donna Brazile, the longtime Democratic strategist who is stepping in as interim DNC chair, is seen as a welcome return to those days.“I think at the end of the day,” a DNC staffer said, “a lot of people are excited for Donna to come on board and straighten shit out.”"
2,POLITICS,Former U.S. Attorney Ditches GOP Over ‘Dangerous Demagogue’ Donald Trump,Jacquie Lee,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/marcos-daniel-jimenez-donald-trump_us_5797a6efe4b02d5d5ed30b84,"Marcos Daniel Jiménez isn't buying Trump's ""law and order"" act.",2016-07-26,"Marcos Daniel Jiménez said he is no longer a member of the Republican Party because it has turned into a ""party of hate.""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5797b0381200007404a5385c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Marcos Daniel Jiménez, a former U.S attorney appointed by President George W. Bush, rescinded his Republican Party membership Monday night in a private Facebook post claiming the party’s core principles had been hijacked by an unstable leader.“I have decided that I will no longer be associated in any way with a party that is led by a bigoted, dangerous demagogue and that has become a party dominated by fear, anger and hate,” said the status, first reported by Politico.In the post, Jiménez appeared to take a shot at GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump. “Republicans should make no mistake about this,” he wrote. “You now clearly belong to the party of hate … you are supporting a strongman who believes all of that.” Trump has dubbed himself the “law and order candidate,” but Jiménez ― whose LinkedIn profile says he was “head of the largest organized crime drug enforcement task force in the U.S.” during his time as a U.S. attorney ― doesn’t seem to buy it. Jiménez told The Huffington Post via email that his Facebook page is private, and that’s why his post was not visible to the public. He said that what he wrote “is self-explanatory” and later sent HuffPost the full next of his post, which appears at the end of this article.Jiménez is just the latest example of a Republican jumping ship over the party’s presidential nominee. Since Trump’s ascension, a handful of influential Republican leaders have bowed out of the GOP. Last month, prominent conservative journalist and commentator George Will changed his voter registration to “unaffiliated” and Iowa state Sen. David Johnson switched from Republican to independent.At the Republican National Convention last week, chaos erupted when delegates began a “roll call” chant in a last-ditch effort to present a united front against the Trump campaign. The scene exposed the lingering tension between Trump supporters and the so-called Never Trump movement.Here is the full text of Jiménez’s Facebook message:This has not been easy to write, and I’ve thought a lot about it. God has blessed me and my family beyond our dreams. I’ve had the privilege and honor to see my brother work for Governor Jeb Bush, to be appointed to a Senate-confirmed office by President George W. Bush, and see my brother also appointed to a Senate-confirmed office by the same president.But I have decided that I will no longer be associated in any way with a party that is led by a bigoted, dangerous demagogue and has become dominated by fear, anger and hate.Republicans should make no mistake about this. You now clearly belong to the party of hate - build the wall, lock her up, make our NATO allies pay, deport 11 million aliens, ban the Muslims, kill terrorists’ families, slander the “Mexican” judge born in Indiana, incite violence at rallies, hide your tax returns, attract white supremacists and anti-semites, mock the disabled, insult others continuously, and stiff the small businessman. Yes, you are supporting a strongman who believes all of that.This Putin admirer has never served our country. If elected, he would be the first president who has never served in either government or the military. His only prior service has been to himself - - in reality TV, cut-corner business deals, and a “university” that took advantage of the people he now purports to defend. He is a coward who will insult a heroic veteran that suffered in a North Vietnamese prison, betting that you will ignore that he did not serve and make a similar sacrifice.The Republican leaders in Congress, and many Republicans in federal and state government, are too timid to stand up to him. To my Republican friends in Congress or other public office, I wish you the best, but I will no longer contribute to your campaigns or any other Republican cause. You are now led by a racist. (For those who still doubt Trump’s racism and the racism he inspires, see the 10 articles in the comments below.)When I was first eligible, I was fortunate to vote for President Reagan, who famously said that he didn’t leave the Democratic Party but that the party left him. I feel the same. The Republican Party left me. After more than 30 years, and as of last Friday when I mailed in my new registration form, I’m no longer a Republican. I am now an independent, because I didn’t sign up for what the Republican Party has become and will not belong to a party that would nominate a man that is an embarrassment to our democracy.H/T Raw StoryThis story has been updated with the full text of Jiménez’s Facebook post.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

But the residences won’t be reserved for Facebook employees ― they’ll be for the public. Fifteen percent of the units would go to low- and middle-income families, per the Journal.“Facebook is committed to being a good neighbor,” a company spokesperson told The Huffington Post. “We understand that our growth affects the everyday lives of our neighbors, and we want to be respectful and thoughtful about how we approach our expansion.”Tech giants in Silicon Valley have sowed resentment among locals who feel they’re being squeezed out of their homes to make way for highly compensated employees at firms like Google and Facebook. In San Francisco, which is just north of Silicon Valley, rents are among the highest in the country, and affordable housing is disappearing.With its new building plan, Facebook hopes to address some of the housing crises that have, in part, been exacerbated by its presence.“There is a lack of housing in the area,” John Tenanes, who oversees Facebook’s real estate projects, told the Journal. “The intent here is to make an impact.”The announcement could also be seen as a concession to critics who oppose Facebook’s planned headquarters expansion in Menlo Park. The company is set to add two office buildings and a 200-room hotel to house 6,500 new employees.The million-square-foot expansion doesn’t have many fans among locals. Residents of the neighboring East Palo Alto have seen rents skyrocket and are increasingly being pushed out of the area, taking cheaper homes farther away and lengthening their daily commutes.“Facebook is coming in and bringing along all these rich folks,” one resident told The Guardian. “They’re able to afford our housing, because it’s nothing to them.”Local advocates in East Palo Alto say that the expansion of tech companies will only increase housing prices and further stratify the population. Some want to see tech firms invest in affordable housing or find other ways to alleviate the problems they helped create. In San Francisco, officials have proposed levying a payroll tax on tech companies to mitigate local housing and homelessness crises. Companies like Google and Facebook haven’t been “paying their fair share,” Eric Mar, a member of San Francisco’s Board of Supervisors who introduced the proposed tax, told The New York Times earlier this month.This story has been updated with a statement from Facebook."

One common response to the negativity is what’s known as “compassion fatigue” – basically, emotional burnout from processing too much stressful information.“Compassion fatigue is sort of an ironic condition,” Dr. Charles Figley, a Tulane University psychologist who specializes in trauma, told The Huffington Post. “Bad news weighs on our minds because it introduces uncertainty; we want to shut it out.

Keith Ellison (D-Minn.), one of the most vocal progressives in the House and an early Sanders endorser, said he’s backing Clinton as the party’s standard-bearer because of the Ku Klux Klan’s support of the GOP nominee.“Because the Ku Klux Klan thinks Donald Trump would be an awesome president,” Ellison said at a Rock The Vote and #cut50 event here on Tuesday. “The Klu Klux Klan thought that his speech was great, and David Duke is so inspired by ... Donald Trump that he’s running for Senate himself.”Duke, former leader of the KKK, announced he is running for the open Senate seat being left vacant by Sen. David Vitter (R) in Louisiana. After initially dodging questions about Duke and other white supremacists who have rallied behind his run, Trump ultimately disavowed the movement. “Now here’s the clue, anybody who the Klan thinks would be good has got to be the deadly enemies of all of us,” Ellison added when asked why he supports Clinton after being in Sanders’ corner until the very end of his run. “If you can do anything to prevent that, then you got to do it.”Sanders supporters protested in the city, surrounding the Wells Fargo Center where the Democratic National Convention kicked off this week. Many said they would never vote for Clinton and that their votes were stolen. Boos from Sanders delegates could be heard throughout the arena during the first hour and a half of speeches on Monday every time Clinton’s name was mentioned. Ellison introduced Sanders to cap off night one of the DNC. But on Tuesday he got personal, talking about his grandfather’s work in organizing African-Americans in the late 1940s to vote. That elicited threats from the Klan to blow up his grandparents’ house. They were so frequent that Ellison’s mom was sent away to boarding school. “I guarantee every African-American in this audience has a story like that,” Ellison said. “So, to us to say, ‘Oh, I’m not scared of Donald Trump. I’m willing to risk letting Donald Trump become president’ ― to us that’s crazy man.“What a land of luxury you must be living in.”"

Some Sanders delegates, citing frustrations with the Democratic National Committee and Clinton’s choice of Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine as her running mate, are not ready to give up on the progressive senator’s political movement. On Monday, Sanders’ own supporters booed him for urging them to elect Clinton and Kaine. Earlier that day, the California delegates breakfast devolved into chaos as Sanders delegates heckled speaker after speaker, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and California Secretary of State Alex Padilla. And at a press conference Monday held by the Bernie Delegates Network, delegates didn’t rule out staging a walkout during Clinton’s acceptance speech on Thursday.Sanders urged delegates to avoid such protests on the convention floor.“Our credibility as a movement will be damaged by booing, turning of backs, walking out or other similar displays,” Sanders wrote in a text message to delegate leaders. “That’s what the corporate media wants. That’s what Donald Trump wants. But that’s not what will expand the progressive movement of this country.”"

And, $25,000 will go towards supporting about 20 extra outreach workers. The city has also partnered with advocates who are well-versed in the issues to help transition homeless people into available shelters, according to ThinkProgress.This approach stands in stark contrast to past conventions.In 2012, for example, during the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida, homeless people were banned entirely from a downtown park where they usually slept and the event site, The Huffington Post reported at the time. “We had to get our stuff, and then we had to go a mile away or whatever from the facility, the area that was having the convention,” Johnson, 30, told The Huffington Post. “I really didn’t approve of it.

And, $25,000 will go towards supporting about 20 extra outreach workers. The city has also partnered with advocates who are well-versed in the issues to help transition homeless people into available shelters, according to ThinkProgress.This approach stands in stark contrast to past conventions.In 2012, for example, during the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Florida, homeless people were banned entirely from a downtown park where they usually slept and the event site, The Huffington Post reported at the time. “We had to get our stuff, and then we had to go a mile away or whatever from the facility, the area that was having the convention,” Johnson, 30, told The Huffington Post. “I really didn’t approve of it. We didn’t have nowhere else to go.”When motel prices skyrocketed in Tampa, and in Charlotte during that year’s DNC, the homeless people who typically relied on such affordable accommodations were also left with nowhere to turn.Charlotte’s motel prices soared 109 percent during that week, according to the LA Times. “I work all day for $60,” Eric Jones, who had recently become homeless, told the news outlet. “Why am I going to pay $60 for a room, then I won’t have enough to spend on food or anything.”Instead of following the lead of other cities, the City of Brotherly Love is taking a cue from its own past major events.When the Pope visited Philadelphia last year, the city also expanded its outreach teams and often had them work with staff from the Department of Behavioral Health or formerly homeless peer specialists.“Our hope is this would be a first step,” Laura Weinbaum of Project HOME, a group that works with homeless people, told ThinkProgress. “Even if the reason resources became available is because of the DNC, obviously we want to make hay when the sun shines.”CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story stated that the 2012 Republican National Convention took place in Charlotte.

9,TECH,Experts Are Building A 'Pokemon Go' Robot For Everyone To Play With,Damon Beres,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/pokemon-go-robot_us_579781b8e4b02d5d5ed2e867,The goal is to offer people a unique way to experience the game.,2016-07-26,"A very basic version of the ""Pokemon Go"" robot grabs a pokeball.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57979cc42a00002d004f6904.gif?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It may seem like everyone is playing “Pokemon Go,” but some people can’t even if they want to.Poke-fans with physical disabilities say the smartphone game, which requires a lot of movement in the real world, simply isn’t accessible, writer Cecilia D’Anastasio explained earlier this month in a must-read piece on Kotaku. But a new robot may give those people an interesting way to experience the game. Let’s Robot, a four-person startup in Berkeley, California, is hammering away at a prototype that’s capable of playing the game with input from human players. The group published a video to YouTube Monday showing a very rough proof of concept.“The video I posted was like the first time we actually got the hardware hooked up and programmed,” Jillian Ogle, an independent video game developer who heads the group, told The Huffington Post in a phone interview Tuesday. The robot in the video doesn’t look like much. It has six wheels, and it uses a simple “plotter” to interact with a smartphone’s touchscreen. “At that stage, we hadn’t even programmed any preset moves or anything, and the motors are moving super-slow because it’s in a safe mode,” Ogle explained. “They can go quite a bit faster, but we’re going to have to come up with an even faster solution for flicking.”Capturing monsters in the game requires you to “flick” your finger across the screen to throw a “Poke Ball.” The robot isn’t up to the task in this video, but Ogle said it’ll get there.The overall goal ― as with many of Let’s Robot’s projects ― is to present an interactive livestream on Twitch. People will be able to tune in, watch the robot wheel around and issue commands to determine how it plays the game.“People who don’t have access to go around and play ‘Pokemon Go’ can at least have some experience with this robot and be able to participate with everyone else,” Ogle said.It won’t be a replacement for the full experience. Group-play efforts like “Twitch Plays Pokemon,” an event where humans banded together to play the original Game Boy game, tend to be a bit chaotic, with thousands of people issuing commands at once. Still, if you want a fresh look at the world’s biggest game, you could certainly do worse. Just ask these guys."
10,POLITICS,Inside Debbie Wasserman Schultz's Decision To Scrap Her Convention Gig,Sam Stein and Amanda Terkel,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/debbie-wasserman-schultz-convention_us_5797a2d4e4b02d5d5ed3065b,"“It was very painful for all.""",2016-07-26,Debbie Wasserman Schultz arrives for a Florida delegation breakfast Monday -- where she was booed by the crowd. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― Though she had already announced her intention to resign as the head of the Democratic National Committee, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (Fla.) held on to the possibility that she’d get one last turn on the big stage. The departing chairwoman wanted to gavel in the convention Monday afternoon, even as officials from Hillary Clinton’s campaign urged her to reconsider, worried that Wasserman Schultz’s presence would produce an avalanche of boos from a crowd still reeling over leaked emails showing her DNC tipping the scales of the primary against Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). But on Monday morning, she appeared before her home-state delegates and was loudly booed, jeered and taunted by Sanders backers ― an affair that shook the Floridian. After the event, sources close to Wasserman Schultz say she went to a holding area to assess the fallout. The first call made was to ensure the security was up to snuff, because, as one aide put it, “the situation on the ground had changed from what it had been 24 hours beforehand.” Wasserman Schultz remained in the room for several hours, consulting with close friends and advisers, eventually reaching the conclusion that she could not take the stage later that night. Her fellow DNC officers had come more quickly to the same conclusion. The officers had scheduled a call on Monday morning to discuss transition plans for when Wasserman Schultz stepped down from the DNC post after the convention. But after the Florida delegation blowup, the call took on new urgency and meaning. Frustrated by Wasserman Schultz’s resistance to give up her convention gaveling duties, they decided that they would need to intervene to ensure that the chair didn’t step foot on the podium. Wasserman Schultz was not on the call. “It was very painful for all,” said one of the sources familiar with what was discussed, who, like others interviewed for this story, would only talk about the private conversations on condition of anonymity. “It was still an open question and lots of tense discussions going on and lots of horse trading,” another source said. By that point, however, it was a moot discussion. Wasserman Schultz, who had fought hard till then to keep her spot at the convention, let it be known that she too understood it would be a distraction if she appeared onstage.The Monday meeting capped a drama-filled few days that saw an end to Wasserman Schultz’s run as party chair. The Florida Democrat had hoped for Philadelphia to salvage her already-controversial tenure by showcasing a unified party and a smooth convention. But the leaking of DNC emails in the days prior, showing some committee staffers plotted ways to raise doubts about Sanders’ religion and candidacy, put a quick end to those notions.In reality, sources say, Wasserman Schultz’s reputation wouldn’t have been improved by Philadelphia even if the convention went swimmingly or if the emails had never leaked. The soon-to-be former chairwoman has a well-earned reputation as a political knife-fighter with a knack for fundraising. “She has a set of brass balls,” is how a former DNC official put it to The Huffington Post. “There are few people I’ve ever worked with who are willing to work harder.” But that official, like many others, said that her management style ― or lack thereof ― left people inside the DNC wondering if she was using the post to advance her own career and not the party’s interests. In one recent incident, according to two sources, Wasserman Schultz was asked to place a call to Vice President Joe Biden to get him to help out the DNC. But instead of asking him to do a fundraising appearance and to lend his name to a digital campaign, she ended up discussing a fundraiser that the VP would do for her congressional campaign ― in order to help her with the hit she’d taken for supporting trade promotion authority and the Iran nuclear deal ― and whether he would attend or record a video for her daughter’s bat mitzvah. A spokesman for Wasserman Schultz’s congressional office did not comment for this piece. However, sources close to her note that the VP has had a long personal relationship with Wasserman Schultz and her family, and often is asked to record videos or send photos for members of Congress. Biden’s fundraiser was ultimately delayed after the shooting in Orlando. Another DNC source said he wasn’t aware of the incident with Biden, but knowing the reputation that Wasserman Schultz had earned inside the building, he said it didn’t surprise him. “It doesn’t sound unlikely,” the source said. “I can believe it. And not so terrible. She loves her daughter.”As HuffPost reported Monday, the problems DNC officials had with Wasserman Schultz didn’t end at her tendency to prioritize her own races. Staffers said morale was low, and there were failures to fill key positions, distrust from Clinton’s campaign over how to handle messaging, and a sense that the committee lacked a core mission. One former DNC official, commenting on Wasserman Schultz’s departure over the leaked email flap, put it this way:“I think she was convicted of the wrong crime. Once these emails came out, I get that the impression it stoked, I understand why the Clinton campaign and the president moved the way they did to clean the situation up.” With Wasserman Schultz gone, the DNC officers are now cleaning up the mess. They spent a significant amount of the meeting Monday drafting a formal apology, which they sent out later in the day. Several of them are now going around to delegation meetings this week in Philadelphia, continuing to apologize in person. Interim DNC Chair Donna Brazile spoke to a black caucus meeting Monday, and Vice Chair R.T. Rybak spoke to the Minnesota and Michigan delegations Tuesday morning."

It later led to DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz announcing her resignation.Sanders himself called the bias against his campaign ― which he had long suspected ― “outrageous” while Sarandon, speaking with Jordan Chariton of The Young Turks, called the DNC’s efforts “disgusting.”“The critical question is, does it matter? Nixon resigned when they broke into the [DNC] headquarters ... and now you found out all this tampering went on. What does this really say about us if all of this goes by unattended?” she asked.Twitter users have still chastised her refusal to get behind Clinton, with some warning Sarandon that refusing to support Clinton’s campaign is a win for Republican rival Donald Trump.Sarandon had previously called Clinton “more dangerous” than Trump, however, by reason that most of his promises are too ridiculous to come to fruition."

The world’s most valuable company posted quarterly revenue of $42.4 billion with profits of $7.8 billion, down from $49.6 billion in revenue and profits of $10.7 billion during the same period last year.

Apple’s “services” category, which includes Apple Music and its App Store, is one of the only areas of significant growth at the company. “They’re in really good shape as a company,” Jan Dawson, chief analyst at Jackdaw Research, told The Huffington Post by email. “But they need to figure out if they can still grow revenues as the iPhone and iPad mature as products and the smartphone and tablet markets start to slow and shrink respectively.”If Apple can’t squeeze more money out of its traditional hardware business, diving into the TV streaming industry could help. By buying “Carpool Karaoke,” Apple may be “dipping a toe into TV-production economics before diving into a Netflix-scale” streaming endeavor, according to Andrew Wallenstein, the co-editor-in-chief of Variety, Hollywood’s industry bible. Adding a Netflix-like stable of original programming would pit Apple Music directly against Amazon Prime. The $99-per-year membership plan, originally made to provide free two-day delivery to shoppers, features a music- and video-streaming service, which last year won Amazon its first-ever Emmy award for the show “Transparent.” “When we win a Golden Globe, it helps us sell more shoes, and it does that in a very direct way,” CEO Jeff Bezos said, according to a recent profile in Newsweek. What he means by that is a must-see show draws audiences to Amazon, thereby getting more potential shoppers in the door. Bezos called it a “flywheel” for the company. Apple, with its current market capitalization of about $522 billion, doesn’t need to reinvent the “flywheel.” A show on which contestants ― including most recently first lady Michelle Obama ― belt out their favorite songs while driving around isn’t likely to sweep at any award shows anytime soon. But if the market for Apple’s traditional cash cows keeps shrinking, “Carpool Karaoke” may point to what the company needs to do next. “In theory they’re all about building differentiation for Apple Music, but we’re seeing some big buys now including ‘Carpool Karaoke,’ which are starting to strain credulity that it’s really about Apple Music,” Dawson said. “It does feel like Apple might be building up to some sort of subscription video service in a roundabout way.”"
18,POLITICS,"Republican Delegates Are Angry At Congress, Dammit!",Matt Fuller,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/republican-delegates-angry-at-congress_us_579624aee4b01180b52f928a,"But yeah, they don't really know why.",2016-07-25,"Texas delegates doffing their hats at the Republican National Convention before GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump took the stage on July 21, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57965cba2400002600b32eea.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"It wasn’t a normal convention and these weren’t normal Republican delegates, but the voters representing their states at the GOP convention in Cleveland, Ohio, shared a similarity with a lot of American voters: They aren’t happy with Congress, and they don’t really know why.You might think Republican delegates would be highly engaged citizens ready to detail their complaints about Congress ― if they had complaints at all. But while most of the more than two dozen delegates who spoke to The Huffington Post said they had negative feelings about congressional Republicans, they couldn’t really explain them, beyond chastising GOP lawmakers for being out of touch with voters and not pushing back hard enough against Democrats and President Barack Obama.“The Republican Party, by and large, you know, the leadership, what they call ‘the elites,’ they do not care about the average voter,” Illinois delegate James Devors told HuffPost last week.“Everyone in Washington, they’re in their little bubble, they’re so far removed from what’s going on in real America, what’s happening to real Americans, they just ― they don’t understand it, they don’t see it,” he added.That may sound like a generic complaint, but it was about the clearest explanation any delegate could offer to explain the ire toward Congress and GOP leadership.It’s also an attitude mirrored by many Republican voters in this country. In a new Morning Consult poll, 23 percent of Republican voters say leaders in their party do not care about people like them, and 46 percent of respondents said their party has “pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track.” In one poll last year, only 23 percent of respondents said Republicans were keeping the promises they made during the campaign, and the congressional approval rating recently fell to 10 percent.All of that may explain why voters are turning to Donald Trump to shake up Washington. But if those voters are anything like the delegates who represented them in Cleveland, they’re operating off of an imperfect understanding of Congress.While the delegates HuffPost talked to were generally upset at GOP leadership for not doing enough to push back against Democrats, they also found ways to blame Democrats for Republican inaction, even when it didn’t make sense to do so.Texas delegate Nelson Spear pointed out that Obama was late with his budget blueprint to Congress numerous times and often could not find Democratic support for it. But when HuffPost told Spear that Republicans had not adopted their own budget this year, he blamed Obama and Democrats all the same.“I’m not saying there are not problems within the Republican Party,” he said. “I’m just saying that, with the atmosphere of noncooperation we have from the executive branch, it makes things ― it really shuts the atmosphere down.”Budgets are typically adopted with the support of the party in charge ― at least, that’s been the case in Congress in recent years. When HuffPost informed Spear that budgets typically pass on a party-line vote, something that didn’t happen this year, he responded, “Well, that’s what the platform’s about,” referring to the GOP document adopted at the convention.Illinois delegate Eugene Cummings echoed Spear, seemingly blaming Democrats when he was told that Republicans had not adopted a budget of their own this year. “That’s got to be a bipartisan thing,” he insisted.Informed that Republicans traditionally adopt a budget with just Republican votes, Cummings said Republicans were “doing the best they can with the opposition they have on the other side.”That was right after Cummings said he wanted Republicans to be more proactive in standing up to the Obama administration, pointing to the Benghazi investigation as an area in which Republicans had not pushed back hard enough. “It didn’t appear that they were using tools available to them, for example, subpoenas,” Cummings said. (For the record, more than 100 people testified before the Benghazi committee.)It’s one thing for voters to be unaware of every twist and turn in Congress. Much of it is meaningless, outside of the messaging ― and it’s entirely reasonable for the average American to ignore most of what Congress is doing day to day. But these are Republican delegates, active in their party and playing a crucial role in naming the GOP nominee. Their discontent with party leaders ― which manifested itself with delegates booing Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell ― is notable, particularly when it’s based on incomplete or even faulty information.Some of this confusion may be due to the new delegates that Trump brought to the convention. One delegate from California, who told HuffPost that he’d been to five conventions, said he normally knows 95 percent of the delegates from his state. This year, he only knew about 5 percent, he said.“I’ve never seen a convention with the kind of delegation that we have or any of the other states have that are made up of everyday people that don’t make a business out of politics,” the delegate said. “And it’s really refreshing.”This delegate said he knew “too much about how Congress works” to be upset with Republican leaders, mentioning a 60-vote threshold and a president who has vetoed “a lot of legislation.”When HuffPost argued that Obama had not vetoed that much legislation ― he’s vetoed the least number of bills (10) since President Warren G. Harding ― the delegate claimed that, “when you get down to it,” Obama had vetoed a lot, actually.“Are we asking questions or having an argument and debate?” the delegate said, eventually ending the interview and refusing to give his name.For an election in which rhetoric and feelings mattered more than policies and facts, the GOP convention and its delegates seemed to mirror the GOP race and the voters themselves."

I’m not worried about getting kicked out of the place, fortunately,” Bratton told reporters in a press conference.New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio appointed Bratton in 2014, largely to help mend relations between the police and marginalized communities. Bratton also served as commissioner from 1994 to 1996. His most recent stint as commissioner has seen a dramatic decline in controversial stop-and-frisk interrogations, which disproportionately target black and brown New Yorkers, but has also been marked by the high-profile deaths of unarmed black men, including Eric Garner and Akai Gurley. Bratton has also come under fire for making disparaging remarks about black Americans.Although he once acknowledged that police are to blame for the “worst parts” of black history, he has described Black Lives Matter as a “leaderless crusade” that exhibits a “different kind of bigotry.” And last year, Bratton cited the highly controversial “Moynihan Report” while claiming that high crime rates were linked to declining values among black Americans.The report, officially titled “The Negro Family: The Case for National Action,” has been criticized for decades for portraying female-led, single-parent families and out-of-wedlock births as contributing to crime and the low social standing of black Americans.“There is something going on in our society and in our cities,” Bratton said in an interview with MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” in September. “I had the occasion over the weekend to read Senator Moynihan’s famous treatise from the ‘60s. Go read that again. Talk about being prescient about what was going to happen, in black society, in terms of ... the disintegration of family, the disintegration of values, and it’s gone beyond just the black community.”Garner’s death ― one of the major inspirations for the Black Lives Matter movement ― focused attention on Bratton’s strategy of “broken windows” policing, which is premised on the idea that aggressively targeting low-level disorder prevents more serious crime. This policing tactic disproportionately ensnares black and brown New Yorkers in the criminal justice system. Bratton has often been at odds with de Blasio, as well as with the mayor’s wife, Chirlane McCray, both of whom have expressed support for Black Lives Matter. De Blasio was voted into office on the promise of police reform. “The very phrase, Black Lives Matter, is a necessary part of the national discussion. It has helped us recognize that, sadly, our history over and over again did not value African-Americans,” the mayor said in a press conference earlier this month.The mayor’s previous statements on race and policing prompted a crowd of police officers to turn their backs on him during the funeral of two fallen officers.Should de Blasio win his bid for re-election next year, he’ll get another chance to appoint a new top cop. Even Bratton believes his successor should have experience in police relations with minority communities, a potential signal that Chief of Department James O’Neill could be considered for the job.O’Neill has been lauded for his efforts to increase positive relations between officers on the force and community members.Christopher Mathias contributed reporting."

Our staff reporters will provide education coverage from Cleveland and Philadelphia. Making college more affordable is a focus of the Democratic Party’s platform for this year’s convention, which marks a significant shift from the past. But what may be missing is a feasible plan to get more low-income students beyond simply enrolling, through to graduation.The prominence of affordable college in the party’s platform is a result of concern over rising tuition costs and skyrocketing student debt, as well as an aggressive push from supporters of Hillary Clinton’s primary-campaign rival Bernie Sanders, who proposed free tuition at all state colleges.The platform includes promises to support institutions that serve minority students, promote cheaper loan repayment plans and more state funding for higher education, and to “go after” for-profit colleges that are deceptive. Most striking is the pledge to make community college free.“It’s kind of a shocking change,” said Andrew Hanson, senior research analyst at Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce. “It’s the first time they’ve included any sort of specificity on higher ed issues. It really does represent a big change from the past.”Still, like most party platforms, it is short on details, and is more a set of priorities than an actual policy document.Related: Republican platform for higher ed: Less red tape and less money “What we’re seeing is the Democrats driving a conversation about what the federal government’s relationship to supporting higher education should be,” said Colin Seeberger, strategic campaigns advisor for the Young Invincibles, a non-profit advocacy group focused on issues that affect young adults. “It’s about whether the federal government should have a greater responsibility.”Making community college free echoes President Obama’s proposal last year. But policy experts note that Federal Pell grants currently cover the average community college tuition in all but three states – South Dakota, New Hampshire and Vermont.Also, the Pell program – which provides a maximum of $5,815 per year ― allows students to keep whatever money is left over after tuition, which can help pay for books, transportation and other living expenses. That’s a big help for low-income students and can be significant in places like California, where average community college tuition is $1,423 and Texas, where it’s $2,361. If tuition were simply waived, students could lose out.Advocates of free community college say the label itself encourages more low-income students to enroll. When Tennessee declared its community colleges free, enrollment increased.Pell grants on average provide enough money to cover four-year public college tuition in only two places, Wyoming and Puerto Rico. Nine states charge tuition that on average is more than twice the maximum Pell grant, including Pennsylvania, Virginia, Illinois, Michigan and New Jersey.Related: Outdated Pell rules may discriminate against low-income studentsClinton’s plan, crafted as a compromise with Sanders’ popular “free college” plan, goes further than the party’s platform. It promises free in-state tuition at all state colleges and universities for families making less than $125,000 a year (about 80 percent of Americans).This proposal would have a much bigger impact on low-income students, only about a quarter of whom earn a bachelor’s degree within six years. Half of students who are older than 25 or don’t live with their families drop out after six years.But tuition is only part of the problem. Tuition is a little more than one-third of the actual cost of attending most state colleges, according to federal data. Students, then, can be on the hook for up to an additional $15,000 after tuition – and that’s why student debt has been rising so fast.Back in 1980, Pell grants covered 77 percent of the cost of attending a four-year public university, but by 2011 that had dropped to barely one-third of the cost, according to The Education Trust. Student debt now averages about $30,000 per student.Students with children can be hit even harder, juggling work, child care costs and college. More than a quarter of all college students are raising kids. Single mothers comprise 43 percent of students raising children and single fathers 11 percent.Clinton says that her proposal to expand funding for on-campus child care centers would open 250,000 new spots for children of college students. She’s also offering a maximum of $1,500 a year to up to one million students to defray transportation and child care costs.But while federal funding can help make college affordable, policy experts argue that it cannot close the gap alone – states will have to pitch in. It’s not clear from the platform how the Democrats would or could implement their pledge to increase state funding for college. Most of the funding decisions – such as tuition rates and financial support for public colleges and universities – take place at the state level.Related: Sanders’ free college plan would take from the rich and give to the rich“States may react badly to the federal government telling them how much they have to spend,” said Preston Cooper, a policy analyst at the Manhattan Institute.One of Clinton’s proposals has drawn excitement from across the political spectrum. She wants to spend $10 billion in federal money to help students enroll in nontraditional post-high school programs, such as computer coding academies, open online courses and other vocational training programs.“There is a sense that there are skills that employers want, and the question is who will do the training and should the public fund it,” said Hanson. “There is skepticism out there about for-profit colleges, but there’s also the sense that education should be connected to jobs and workforce development, and that idea is gaining ground.”The Democrats’ higher education platform may indeed solidify, and even excite, their traditional base, but it’s unclear how much of it will become policy. Even if it does, it’s equally unclear whether it would increase the number of low-income Americans who earn college degrees.The gap between tuition and the actual cost of college is something that parents and students quickly become aware of after a year or two of college. The extra financial burdens that many low-income aspiring college graduates carry can lead them to drop out, often with debt, and with no feasible pathway to a job that will allow them to pay back their loans. The platform does not make clear how the Democrats would address this all-too-common problem.This story was produced by The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit, independent news organization focused on inequality and innovation in education."

Ted Cruz (R-Texas) had hurt his own reputation by declining to endorse the businessman at the Republican National Convention last week. They appear to have been right in the short term: Cruz’s favorability with Republican and Republican-leaning voters plummeted after his speech, according to a CNN/ORC poll released Monday.The poll, conducted in the two days following the convention, found only 33 percent of voters have a favorable view of Cruz. Prior to the convention, a survey put Cruz’s favorability at 60 percent among Republican and Republican-leaning voters, according to CNN. The poll also showed an overall bounce for Trump ― not an uncommon result for candidates immediately following their party’s convention, in part because they often unify the parties. At the Republican convention in Cleveland, many GOP voters unified against Cruz. After making a failed bid for the nomination, he declined to endorse Trump and told Republicans to “vote your conscience.” Cruz was met with boos from the crowd, but didn’t back down the next day, saying it was personal because of Trump’s attacks on his wife and father. “[I’m not going to] come like a servile puppy dog and say, ‘Thank you very much for maligning my wife and maligning my father,” Cruz told the Texas delegation at the RNC. Trump later said he didn’t want Cruz’s endorsement anyway and wouldn’t accept it. He said Cruz “would’ve been in better shape for four years from now” if he did endorse Trump.“Somebody got booed the hell out of a place by thousands and thousands of people,” Trump said on Friday. “There wasn’t one person in the room ― not one. And then they said there may not be unity. Unity? There wasn’t one person in the room, including the Texas delegation, right? Honestly, he may have ruined his political career.”Trump also threatened to launch a super PAC to take down Cruz. Cruz has low overall favorability nationwide in the new CNN/ORC poll. Twenty-seven percent of all voters surveyed said they had a favorable opinion of them, including just 18 percent of those who lean Democrat.Of course, this is a single poll that took place immediately after the flap, and there’s a lot of time for Cruz to regain his footing with conservatives. He doesn’t have to run for reelection until 2018, or for president until 2020. "
23,POLITICS,"Hispanic Voter Registration Is Up, But Polls Suggest That They Are Less Likely To Vote",Grace Sparks,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/hispanic-voters-2016-election_us_579648e6e4b02d5d5ed253d4,Low turnout of Hispanic voters would likely hurt Hillary Clinton.,2016-07-25,"Voters go to the polls for Super Tuesday primaries in the predominantly Latino neighborhood of Boyle Heights on Feb. 5, 2008, in Los Angeles.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57964ac51200002900a534d1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hispanic voters are registered in record numbers, and they generally support presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. But despite the focus on immigration in this year’s election rhetoric, Hispanic voters are still less likely to vote than some other groups.A July Washington Post poll showed that 39 percent of Hispanic voters said there’s a less than 50/50 chance they will vote in the presidential election in November. This number is very high compared with other groups such as whites (11 percent) and African-Americans (13 percent). This trend is also reflected in a recent poll from The Economist/YouGov, in which 9 percent of Hispanics said they aren’t sure who they’ll vote for, while 8 percent said they probably won’t vote in the 2016 election. In comparison, 3 percent of white voters said they probably won’t vote and only 1 percent of black voters had the same response.Pew Research found that despite record numbers of Hispanics coming out to vote in past elections, they still lag behind other subgroups. In 2012, 48 percent of eligible Hispanic voters participated in the election, compared to 49.9 percent in 2008. This is less than the 2012 turnout rates for both blacks (66.6 percent) and whites (64.1 percent).At the same time, Hispanic voter registration reached a record high this past spring. Hispanics are often seen as less likely to register to vote due to registration laws for undocumented citizens and voting restrictions that negatively impact Hispanic voters.Age could be a factor that hurts Hispanic voter turnout. Nate Cohn of The New York Times points out that a large portion of eligible Hispanic voters are young, and young people, in general, are less likely to vote. Studies also show that young people or people of color are less likely to vote because they tend to feel excluded or disconnected from society, creating less of an incentive to vote. There are some indications Hispanics might vote in higher numbers this year. Some experts have projected that as many as 13.1 million Hispanics will vote in 2016, compared to 11.2 million in 2012 and 9.7 million in 2008.Among Hispanics registered to vote in Colorado and Nevada, 80 percent reported they were less likely to vote Republican due to nominee Donald Trump’s views on immigration. Trump has made disparaging statements about Mexican immigrants and wants to build a wall along the southern border of the U.S. However, according to a Gallup poll, only 38 percent of Hispanic voters strongly agreed that they were afraid of the election outcome, compared with 51 percent of national adults and 64 percent of African-Americans. If Hispanics don’t turn out to vote, it’s likely bad news for Clinton. A Latino Victory Project poll of Latino voters showed Clinton with 76 percent of the vote and Trump with only 13 percent. "

Dannel Malloy predicts the party will be unified. It's just taking a while.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/default-missing-image.jpg?cache=jIO2VoZgTY&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― Surrogates for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign have been remarkably poised in addressing the lingering dissatisfaction that Bernie Sanders’ supporters feel toward the Democratic ticket. But under the grueling heat here in Philadelphia, where the Democratic National Convention is being held, it’s clear that patience is beginning to fade. Several Clinton sources I spoke to today said they were agitated that Sanders boosters at the convention had turned the first day into a spectacle of protest, directed even at Sanders himself for encouraging them to back the Clinton-Kaine ticket. And one top governor backing Clinton made the most forceful case yet that these same Sanders supporters, among others (including the media), were overstating the controversy of leaked emails that show Democratic National Committee officials trying to tip the scales for Clinton during the primary. “I think any grievance that someone feels is legitimate. To the degree [the Sanders supporters’ grievances] is legitimate I think is a question,” Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy (D) said in an interview with The Huffington Post. “The idea that people working for the DNC don’t have their own personal opinions is a fallacy. Obviously, people working for Bernie Sanders wouldn’t like all of their emails released tomorrow.” “I think we live in a world where people put things in writing that in many cases, they are letting off steam,” Malloy added. “They are expressing anger. And when you read those things in isolation, then they come out one way when really they are part of a narrative which is written over a much longer period of time when people have highs and lows. That’s the reality.”Malloy spoke a day after DNC Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz resigned over the release of those emails via Wikileaks, and just hours after she and Sanders were both heckled by Sanders supporters at their respective meetings with home-state delegates. Though the jeering had dominated much of the news coverage of the day, Malloy said he was not overly concerned with the prospects of long-term party disunity.“Most of them are with us. We have to bring the rest of them along,” he explained. “Think of who is here in Philadelphia. These are the die-hards of the die-hards and I think they’re having a hard time with it. On the other hand, I think the senator is demonstrating leadership in trying to bring other people along.”Malloy could qualify as an expert on the discontent of Sanders supporters. As a DNC platform co-chair, he was accused by the Sanders campaign of being biased in his handling of the primary process. Addressing that criticism indirectly, he noted that the party had made changes to the nomination process in line with what Sanders had demanded, along with adopting a historically progressive platform ― one that he called a “quantum leap forward” compared to past cycles. The Connecticut governor will speak at the convention on Monday night and, like most others taking the lectern, he is likely to face heckling from the crowd. But his remarks aren’t geared completely toward addressing the current rift or, for that matter, the current election. As chair of the Democratic Governors Association, he has spearheaded a campaign to get the party to pay close attention to state races that could end up affecting the balance of power in Congress.Malloy has been encouraging voters, activists and donors this week to start planning for the redistricting process that will come after the census in 2020. It will be a primary focus of his speech tonight, which will include a video underscoring the point.“What I’m saying is, ‘Hey, Democrats, we didn’t pay attention in ‘10 or ‘08 or ‘06,’” said Malloy. “We have to pay attention now and we have to be building victory, on victory on victory.” Unlike presumptive Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Kaine, Malloy said he thought that Democrats still had an outside chance to retake the House before that redistricting takes place. But he said that if the party was thinking honestly, and smartly, it would recognize that it’s unlikely to happen before then.“Is it impossible? It is not impossible,” said Malloy. “But it is not probable that we are going to do that either. Listen, I hope and pray that that happens. That would be great. But what I would tell you definitely won’t happen is we won’t take back state houses in that time because as good a job as Republicans did on congressional seats, they did an even better job on local seats.”"

But according to the Black Sabbath frontman, things are “back on track.” In an interview that aired on Monday’s episode of “Good Morning America,” Osbourne revealed that the separation was “just a bump in the road.” When “GMA” contributor Jesse Palmer told him that plenty of fans want the couple’s love to prevail, Osbourne stated, “It’s back on track again.” The rocker’s son Jack joined his dad in the interview to add his two cents about married life. Jack married Lisa Stelly in 2012. “As a married person myself, marriage is not like, ‘Hey, we’re married, all is good.’ I mean, it’s just life,” Jack said.The senior Osbourne added, “And we both live happily ever after? I’d like to find the person who wrote that and poke him in the eye with a burning stick. Some days it’s good, some days it’s terrible, some days you just drift apart for a while, but you get back on the horse, you know?”Watch the whole interview below: UPDATE - 3:40 p.m.: Sharon Osbourne has responded to Ozzy’s interview, admitting that while the two are working on their issues, it’s not so simple. “Um, ‘Get back on the horse,’ how dare you?

I shouldn’t speak for him but I know he wants to come on the show anyway and talk for himself to you all. I’m fine with that. He feels he owes everybody here an apology because he’s put us all through it.”“He’s very embarrassed and ashamed about his conduct. Through his shame and embarrassment he finds it hard to get it out. With you guys, I think he’ll be much better. It will be easier for him to speak,” she continued. “I can’t speak for him. But for me, um, yes, you know. I forgive. It’s going to take a long time to trust but you know we’ve been together for 36 years, 34 of marriage, and it’s more than half of my life.”“I just can’t think of my life without out him. Even though he is a dog. He’s a dirty dog,” she said. “So there we are. He’s going to pay big.”"
27,POLITICS,Trump Support Suffers Post-RNC Among This Traditionally Republican Demographic,Samantha Neal,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-white-college-voters_us_57963e21e4b02d5d5ed248ab,Donald Trump lost support after the convention among white college-educated voters.,2016-07-25,"Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump speaks at a post Republican Convention campaign event in Cleveland, Ohio, July 22, 2016.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/57963eef1200002900a5349c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Although new polling indicates Trump is enjoying a modest spike in support after the Republican National Convention, he experiences the opposite effect among white college-educated voters. A CNN/ORC poll released Monday shows a significant divide among this traditionally Republican voting bloc. Among college-educated white voters, Clinton actually improves her standing: initially split with Trump 40-40 before the convention, she now pulls ahead with a 44 to 39 percent lead after the RNC. The opposite happened among white voters who lack college degrees. Trump’s 20 percent advantage in this demographic before the convention has grown to 39 percentage points after the RNC. Post-RNC polling by Morning Consult likewise echoes the Clinton-Trump education disparity among voters of all races. Pre-convention, Trump barely edged past Clinton by three percentage points among the non-college educated. Post-convention, he surges past her by ten percentage points. The split in educated voters among the two candidates may not be altogether surprising, as Donald Trump Jr.’s speech at the RNC emphasized Trump’s appeal to blue-collar workers ― even going so far as to knock those who went to college (despite he himself being a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, one of the most prestigious business schools in the world). “Many of the top executives in our company are individuals that started out in positions that were blue collar. … [My father’s] true gift as a leader is that he sees the potential in people that they don’t see in themselves,” Trump Jr. said. “Potential that other executives would overlook because their resumes don’t include the names of fancy colleges and degrees. We didn’t learn from MBAs, we learned from people who had doctorates in common sense.” The education disparity signals trouble for Trump, as white college-educated voters not only comprises one-third of the electorate, but have traditionally voted Republican since 1952. In 2012, Mitt Romney won this demographic by 14 points. George W. Bush, the last successful Republican candidate, soundly won this constituency by 5 percentage points in 2004."
28,POLITICS,Sanders Supporters Aren't Mad About Bernie's Endorsement Of Hillary Clinton,Julia Craven,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-supporters-clinton_us_57964fd8e4b02d5d5ed259fc,"It doesn't necessarily mean they like Clinton, though.",2016-07-25,"Amanda Sullivan, a 35-year-old computer programmer from West End, Florida, said she will vote for Sanders or Green Party Candidate Jill Stein over Hillary Clinton. ",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/579650fc1200002a00a534e7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"PHILADELPHIA ― Even though Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) will not be the Democratic nominee, his supporters are still feeling the bern. And while the antipathy many Sanders voters feel toward Hillary Clinton is well documented, some of the senator’s fans see his endorsement of Clinton as just another example of Bernie staying true to his values. “From the beginning, Bernie stated that he was going to run as a Democrat and that he would support the candidate ― whoever that would be,” Sharon Rhines, a 67-year-old retired teacher from Grand Rapids, Michigan, told The Huffington Post. Rhines said that unlike some supporters, she doesn’t feel betrayed by Sanders himself. Rather, she said, her ire lies with the Democratic Party. “They are so rigged, and so despicable that they had Hillary in place before the primaries even began,” she said, alluding to the recent leak of DNC emails suggesting the party favored Clinton over Sanders. Amanda Sullivan, a 35-year-old computer programmer from West End, Florida, expressed similar sentiments. Sanders “did what he had to do to support the Democratic Party,” she said. “He feels grateful for the platform they’ve allowed him to have, and I understand that,” Sullivan continued. “So he is being courteous, he’s being respectful ― which is what we want in a president.”  Jack Prince, a 66-year old retired teacher from Michigan, touted Sanders as representing “an unique moment of possibility for our country.” “Unlike any other candidate in my lifetime, he stands against the only integral problem ― and that is the money in politics,” Prince said. “His platform, his message, to break that bond between the political world and money, is the answer to everything. We’re going to see a corporatist put into the office of president [by] the name of Hillary Clinton and the same ol’ same ol’ is gonna roll.” Prince said he still has hope that Sanders will turn against Clinton and break away from the Democratic Party. But when it comes to Sanders’ endorsement of Clinton, Prince said he feels let down. “He has reasons why he endorses that he thinks are advantageous to his cause,” Prince said. “He’s playing his cards wrong right now ― but we both want the same outcome.” "
