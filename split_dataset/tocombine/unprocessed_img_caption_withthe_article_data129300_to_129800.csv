Britain's Met Office said several weather warnings remained in place for the coming days, with more heavy rain and gale force winds expected.Prime Minister David Cameron, who visited the region on Friday, has announced extra funding for flood defence repairs and maintenance. He is due to chair a meeting of the government's emergency committee later on Sunday.But Environment Agency chairman Chris Smith, who received a frosty reception when he visited flood-hit areas this week, has faced calls to step down.On Sunday, the government's communities minister Eric Pickles, who took over responsibility for the flood response after the environment minister was taken ill, apologised.""We made a mistake, there's no doubt about that, and we perhaps have relied too much on the Environment Agency's advice,"" he told the BBC, saying the government now realised rivers should have been dredged to help prevent flooding.""I'll apologise unreservedly and I'm really sorry that we took the advice,"" he said. ""We thought we were dealing with experts.""In the Somerset Levels, where muddy brown water stretched off in all directions as far as the eye could see, nearly 3 million tonnes of water were being pumped out every day.Earlier in the week, high tides and stormy seas destroyed a large section of sea wall at Dawlish in Devon, washing a stretch of railway track into the sea. Further flooding and landslips cut off all rail links to Devon and Cornwall on Saturday.On Sunday afternoon Network Rail, Britain's rail network operator, said one route had now reopened for a limited service, with trains running at a reduced speed.Low cost airline Flybe has said it will double the number of flights it runs on weekdays from Newquay in Cornwall to London to help alleviate transport problems.Nigel Farage, the leader of Britain's anti-European Union party UKIP, has called for some of the overseas aid budget to be diverted to help tackle the flooding. Speaking to the BBC during a visit to the region on Sunday, he described the government's response as ""Too little, too late"". (Writing by Kylie MacLellan in London, Editing by Tom Heneghan)"

As a result, Americans take precautions to keep such possessions safe. Not many, however, would think to lock up their Nutella, pregnancy tests or Tide laundry detergent. Yet, these everyday, ordinary household products are among the most commonly stolen goods.Some stolen items seem unusual because their value is not easily visible. For example, thieves steal catalytic converters for the platinum. Frank Scafidi of the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) gave the example of manhole covers, as well as a variety of other metal objects, that are often stolen to be resold as scrap metal. Incidents of these kinds of theft have risen considerably, likely due to the rising price of metals like copper, and platinum.Click here to see 10 weird things thieves stealSimilarly, the production of maple syrup relies heavily on weather patterns. With poor sugaring conditions in recent years, the price of sap and maple syrup have risen considerably, increasing the potential reward for thieves targeting the product. Another grocery item, steak, has also become more vulnerable to shoplifting due to rising prices.Another explanation for unusual incidents of theft is unmet demand. In the case of shrubbery theft, for example, collectors are willing to pay large sums for rare and valuable plants –even illegally. Nutella, which is relatively expensive and in high demand, is a commonly stolen product, according to the National Retail Federation (NRF).According to Rich Mellor, senior advisor at the National Retail Federation (NRF), the “easiest thing to steal is getting stolen, not necessarily for its desirability.” So, while intrinsic value and price increases are important factors, a thief ultimately wants to avoid getting caught.24/7 Wall St. consulted the National Retail Federation and the National Insurance Crime Bureau to identify a variety of commonly stolen objects. We also reviewed various news sources to identify 10 of the strangest things thieves steal.These are the 10 weirdest things thieves steal, according to 24/7 Wall St.:"

AOL is the parent company of The Huffington Post.In a letter to staff, Armstrong wrote:""The leadership team and I listened to your feedback over the last week. We heard you on this topic. And as we discussed the matter over several days, with management and employees, we have decided to change the policy back to a per-pay-period matching contribution. The Human Resource team will be in contact with all employees over the next week to explain the change and to answer any other benefits related questions you might have.""The new 401(k) policy would no longer match contributions on a per-paycheck basis. Instead, matching contributions would be handed out in lump sum at the end of the year. Employees who left the company would not receive matching contributions for the year they departed. Armstrong had cited Obamacare and two women who gave birth to ""distressed babies"" as reasons for the change. In his email to staffers today, Armstrong apologized for the remark about pregnancies.""On a personal note, I made a mistake and I apologize for my comments last week at the town hall when I mentioned specific healthcare examples in trying to explain our decision making process around our employee benefit program.""Here's his full letter:AOLers - "

Stolz is her partner's surname.Russia has come under heavy international criticism for a law banning the spread of ""gay propaganda"" among minors.Asked ahead of her competition in the mountains above Sochi whether she was worried about the law, Iraschko-Stolz replied: ""No, on the contrary, I think everything is being blown up bigger than it is. I had a very good welcome like every other athlete. There were absolutely no problems.""Moscow says the law is needed to defend young people but activists say it is fuelling anti-gay violence in Russia.Russian police detained gay rights activists who tried to protest on Moscow's Red Square and in St Petersburg on Friday, shortly before the Games officially opened.""Naturally you have to look at it from a different point of view and always be critical, but especially in my situation, I don't want to talk too much about it,"" said the Austrian, who is one of the leading contenders for a medal in Tuesday's normal hill event.""I only want to focus on sports and I think if you're tolerant towards everyone else they treat you the same way and it gives you a lot of joy. I think you can make a statement by jumping well.""Iraschko-Stolz dominated the three jumps in the first training session on Saturday, coming first in two and second in the other. She slipped and fell at the end of the second jump but said she had only slightly injured her hand.Women's ski jumping is making its first appearance at a Winter Games, thanks in part to a decade-long pressure campaign by female athletes and their backers.Iraschko-Stolz was one of 15 women jumpers who unsuccessfully sued the organisers of the 2010 Games in a bid to be allowed to compete.""Living in the Olympic village is much better than I'd ever imagined. At the moment I'm living like a fairy tale because as a child I always wanted to take part in the Olympics Games,"" she said.""That it's happening now at the age of 30 is unbelievable... every day when I wake up I'm still here and that must mean it's true.""
