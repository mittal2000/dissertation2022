3,EDUCATION,The Vitality of Collegiate Recovery,"Tim Rabolt, ContributorCollegiate recovery advocate from The George Washington Univer...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-vitality-of-collegiat_b_9584012.html,There has never been a more critical time to support the widespread establishment of collegiate recovery programs (CRPs),2016-04-02,2016-03-31-1459445047-2233876-ARHEhorizontallogocolorv2LOWRES.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-03-31-1459445047-2233876-ARHEhorizontallogocolorv2LOWRES-thumb.png,"There has never been a more critical time to support the widespread establishment of collegiate recovery programs (CRPs). The most recently available data from the U.S. Department of Education reports that approximately 21 million students were expected to attend the nearly 4,400 nationwide colleges and universities in fall of 2015. The full report states that ""Increases in the traditional college-age population and rising enrollment rates have contributed to the increase in college enrollment. Between 2000 and 2012, the 18- to 24-year-old population rose from approximately 27.3 million to approximately 31.4 million. The percentage of 18- to 24-year-olds enrolled in college also was higher in 2012 (41.0 percent) than in 2000 (35.5 percent)."" These statistics are significant because college campuses are widely regarded as the scenes of excessive partying, drinking, and substance use. In a report titled ""Collegiate recovery communities: What they are and how they support recovery"" the following data were found for an average university of 30,000 students: • 31.6%, or 9,480 students met the criteria for excessive substance use  • 6%, or 1,800 students met the criteria for substance dependency  • 1.5%, or 451 students met the criteria for actively seeking help from substance dependencyIn 2016, assuming enrollment has remained constant at approximately 21 million, our country will see the following:  • Approximately 6.64 million total college students meet criteria for excessive substance use  • Approximately 1.26 million total college students meet criteria for substance dependency  • Approximately 315,000 total college students are actively seeking help from substance dependency Additionally, this data does not address the fact that 25% of college students have a diagnosed mental health disorder, or approximately 5 million individuals, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI). Collegiate recovery programs can help students in recovery by providing recovery support services on campus. CRPs are filling the gap in the continuum of care by enabling students who are in recovery to pursue their academic and personal goals simultaneously. CRPs help students overcome barriers to recovery and provide students with an array of recovery and academic support services. A 2014 study from Dr. Alexandre Laudet and others demonstrated that students active in CRPs have higher rates of retention, graduation, and grade point average than the average student.. The vitality of supporting the intersection of education and recovery has never been clearer than it is today. For the students struggling with a substance use or mental health challenge looking to improve their health and wellness and reach their full potential, there is undoubtedly no better solution than the nationwide establishment of sustainable collegiate recovery programs. The first recovery support program for students in recovery on a college campus started at Brown University in 1977. Since then, the three most notable CRPs have become Rutgers University, Augsburg College, and Texas Tech University, which all were established in the 1980s or 1990s. Institutions of higher education have improved greatly on their efforts to implement prevention, intervention, and treatment programs, but most are lacking in specific programming to support those students who are in recovery. College is often the time for young adults to experiment with drugs and alcohol for the first time. Media, Greek-life, and other factors only contribute to this ever-growing culture of substance use. When individuals are progressing through high school, they are frequently told that college is ""the time of their lives."" They think achieving this false perception is done through drinking, smoking, sex, partying, and other risky activities that take away from overall health and wellness.The main barriers to establishing collegiate recovery services at institutions across the nation are stigma and funding. Stigma discourages individuals from speaking up, seeking treatment, and even ""coming out"" about being in recovery after having gone through detox and/or treatment. Though stigma can be eradicated through advocacy, awareness, and education, the issue of funding still persists. In order to run a fully functional collegiate recovery program, a budget for staff, space, housing, and programs is needed. Many CRPs have the goal of endowment in mind, but donations and grants are extremely hard to come by for an area that is so new and lacking an abundance of evidence-based practices. From the countless reports and increasing number of programs, there are many benefits to having students in recovery on a college campus and their impact reaches far beyond the CRP. The campus at large is also positively affected by having a visible and vocal CRP present. CRP students that are open about their recovery and are involved in behavioral health efforts on campus can use their experience to provide more effective messaging to the other students. Typically, students in recovery have a tremendous sense of gratitude, grace, and redemption, which makes them assets in the classroom. They take class seriously, they are of service to their peers, and they take advantage of every opportunity to better themselves. Universities have tried many approaches s to combat the effects of students' drug and alcohol use. A CRP is the most comprehensive method to support students who are in recovery. Because of a CRP, students are returning to school and maintaining their recovery simultaneously. They are contributing to their campus through their service, compassion, and gratitude. Parents are able to sleep soundly at night knowing that their child is being supported and looked out for while they are away at college. The necessity for these programs and the benefits of them is clear. By investing in these students, schools will be sending a message that individuals who suffer from a mental health or substance use disorder are worthwhile and deserve every chance needed to pursue a college degree.

Smashing up expensive racing cars with Jack Nicholson is fun and all that, but what happens, you know, next? The Story of God, a six-part National Geographic special that launches Sunday at 9 p.m. ET, lets Freeman explore an infinitely expansive subject with which he has long professed fascination: what exists out there beyond what we can tangibly identify through our five senses. As the scope of the project suggests, this is not popcorn television. It requires the viewer to pay attention and offers rewards commensurate with that involvement.To confirm the obvious, Freeman doesn't claim to have produced a definitive factual biography of The Almighty. Rather, he examines the historical and theological facets of humankind's relationship with a perceived higher being. The first episode deals with the afterlife, and how our perception of an afterlife shapes our behavior and our beliefs while life is still in progress. The second Sunday's episode is ""End of Days,"" examining man's fascination with the apocalypse. (Above: Freeman with a fragment from the book of Revelation.) Subsequent weeks, in order, tackle ""Creation,"" ""Who is God?,"" ""Evil"" and ""Miracles.""Freeman, who coproduced the series with Lori McCreary and James Younger, serves as host, narrator and a major presence. In the opening ""Afterlife"" episode, he weaves stories of the Egyptian pharaohs and their pyramid monuments with his own memories of growing up in Greenwood, Miss., and losing his brother. Something of his brother lives on in him, he says, the same way something of Ramesses II lives through inscriptions on the walls of his tomb. While The Story of God has a consistently respectful and even reverent tone, it may not please viewers who strongly feel their own deity, or their own beliefs, hold the only truth. Freeman visits Hindus, Muslims, Jews, Christians, Native Americans and others, noting their varying beliefs in matters from the origin of the universe to what happens after death. He notes that Hindus, for example, believe we are resurrected, perhaps many times. That's not a reward. That's an indication we didn't get it right the last time, so we continue to be resurrected until we do. The goal is to live such a good life that one no longer needs to be resurrected, but ascends to a state of eternal energy, harmonious with the universe. That's in some contrast to Christianity, where belief in the resurrection of Jesus offers the path to atonement for all our mortal sins. The Story of God meticulously traces major religions back to their known origins, and while that inevitably gives some of the discussion a theological grounding, Freeman also takes care to acknowledge the concrete implications in daily life. That covers matters from the persecution of early Christians by the Romans to the contemporary issue of modern radical Islam. Freeman talks with a former recruiter for militant Islamic groups, who explains that he was radicalized while growing up in the United Kingdom when he saw his friends attacked and beaten by white supremacists. He, Freeman and others stress that militant groups comprise an infinitesimal percentage of the world's Muslim population. Still, his story lends strong support to the argument that trying to isolate and stigmatize Muslims seeds more militant radicalism, not less. Not surprisingly, Freeman acknowledges at many points in the series that his exploration leaves him with more questions, not more answers. On the subject of the creation, for instance, he lays out the physical scientific evidence. He also asks whether, within that evidence, there could have been a divine hand at work. Looking forward, Freeman notes some scientists are confident technology and our growing knowledge of the brain may one day enable us to catch up with science fiction and create a robot with a human soul. For the present, though, The Story Of God is mostly a story of our response to our own faith. God is largely whoever or whatever we believe Him or Her to be, and those beliefs have shaped much of human history. Freeman makes that complex discussion engaging, if only through his own palpable fascination with it.All we really know for sure, of course, is that almost all of us have considered these questions at some point - and no one, so far, has found a way to cross it off the bucket list."

6,BUSINESS,John Ratzenberger - American Made,"Stacey Alcorn, ContributorAuthor, Speaker, Entrepreneur, Attorney, and Mom",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-ratzenberger--americ_b_9599966.html,"At the end of the day, John Ratzenberger says that his passion in life is simple, it's America. He wants to bring back improvisation, real fame, creators, and those who are willing to fall and get back up, because these are the roots upon which America was built.",2016-04-02,2016-04-02-1459596699-916981-TheVoiceofJohnRatz_Characters.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2016-04-02-1459596699-916981-TheVoiceofJohnRatz_Characters-thumb.jpg," There's a good chance you know him as Cliff Clavin, the know-it-all postman on Cheers. Or maybe you know him from his hit show Made In America on the Travel Channel where he showcased the people behind the products made in the USA. He has worked on feature films like Superman and Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back, as well as independent films like The Woodcarver. He's also the only actor to voice a role in every Pixar film with such beloved characters as Mack the Truck and Hamm the Piggy Bank. John Ratzenberger has been listed as the 6th most successful actor of all time in terms of box office receipts and there's no slowing him down. In addition to an average of 5 speeches a month, regular visits with Congressional leaders on issues that affect American manufacturers and another Pixar film release this summer, he'll be launching 1-2 minute syndicated vignettes called ""It's a Little Known Fact"" on radio stations nationwide starting this month.Successful? No question. Self-made? You bet. He started his acting career while working part-time as a carpenter to pay the bills.Ambitious? Let's just say that in between his acting, vocal talents, and screen writing, he is also an avid entrepreneur with his hands in several businesses. Ambitious is an understatement. Passionate? Without a doubt. And that's what brings us to today and this article. John Ratzenberger loves acting, writing, and entrepreneurship. But his absolute passion is America. He's a fascinating person to talk to, rich with knowledge of history and how things work. He could talk for hours about the infrastructure of America and how highways, tunnels, and cities were meticulously built during a time when the only manpower was true man power; the blood, sweat, and tears of laborers. Ratzenberger is an aficionado of learning, a connoisseur of understanding the mechanics of how things work, and an advocate for re-introducing trade, mechanics, shop, and carpentry skills back into schools so that we can truly marry human talent and skill to today's innovative society in order to create a better America. He says that he hopes his legacy, when people fall upon his name one hundred years from now, is not that he was Cliff from Cheers, or Mack the Truck in a Pixar film, but that he was that guy who advocated for empowering individuals to leave America better than it was found. Here are John Ratzenberger's four simple strategies for putting the most powerful brand in the world back into the hands of the people to make Made in the USA mean something again:Improvisation: John Ratzenberger's acting career began in London. At the time, he was a carpenter when he and his best friend, Ray, decided to start doing comedy shows at night calling themselves ""Sal's Meat Market."" They would perform on small local stages and do an improvisation act where he and Ray would each take 10 or 15 characters a piece, forcing them to think quickly on their feet and to improvise the skit based on the other's performance. In fact, Ratzenberger's entire life and career have been built off this idea of improvisation, the ability to create something using the only resources you have available. John says that when you study the history of America, our ancestors were amazing improvisers in everything they did. Improvisation made America great. He explained, when something fell apart in the homes of our ancestors, they'd figure out a way to fix it with the resources they had available to them. He says that this is not the case today. Rarely can a twenty-something year old fix anything that is broken because the shop, mechanical, and trade classes have been eliminated from so many schools. In the old days our grandparents would pull apart the broken toaster and fix it, whereas today that toaster gets heaved in the trash and a new one purchased. The cost of this is astronomical. The cost, says Ratzenberger, is a society of young people who could never duplicate the infrastructure upon which all of society has been built. So much emphasis is on teaching computers and technology, but he says the real opportunity for advancement is in also teaching the skills that made America great in the first place. The art of improvisation in an industrious society, says Ratzenberger, is the art of making something better, but you can't improve something until you understand how it was made to begin with.Become Famous: Ratzenberger says that so many people confuse fame with celebrity status. He says celebrities experience short term fame. They are celebrity until the last person who knew of them dies. He says that he wants young people to understand the difference so that they are aspiring to be famous in a way that changes the world for the better. For example, Thomas Edison, Steve Jobs, and Alexander Graham Bell are famous in the sense that they can never be forgotten because of the impact they had on humanity. Ratzenberger says that every kid has the ability to become famous in a small way that changes the world, but that the only way to do so is to learn a skill that nobody can take from them. He says that he is an advocate for teaching the next generation on how to become self-reliant by learning how to build, repair, and create things. Making Vs. Assembling: Ratzenberger says there is a world of difference between assembling something and creating something. He says, if anything, we are raising kids who can barely assemble something, never mind create something of their own. He says that for the kids who learn how to make things, such as understanding how to build something from scratch, the world will be their oyster. As a Chief Advisor for Industrialization at Elite Aviation Products, a company that makes aviation products for the likes of Boeing and NASA, Ratzenberger is a huge proponent of seeking out the kids who can make stuff. That is why Elite Aviation Products is a sponsor of the UC-Irvine team who recently competed in the Space X Hyperloop competition which pitted teams against one another in trying to create the pod that would transport people in the proposed new high speed ground transportation system. Their team placed 5th out of 120 teams in the competition, and as far as Ratzenberger sees it, he and his friends at Elite Aviation Products are doing their part to encourage a new generation of makers who are armed with the knowledge and skill to move America forward.Learn To Fail: In addition to teaching the next generation to create, he says that building a better country requires that kids also learn how to fail. He says that thirty years ago, every kid on the little league team didn't get a trophy. There were winners and losers. Kids were told the hard, honest truth when they didn't do well and the upside to this is that kids learned at a young age how to work through their emotions and how to work harder to do better next time. Fast forward a few decades to today where kids don't have the ability to exercise their emotional muscles and you end up with young adults who do not emotionally or physically show up to work as they should. Not only that, when they lose their jobs, the parents show up demanding better treatment for their young adult children. This is one of the reasons that Ratzenberger and his Elite Aviation team are so passionate about hiring veterans. He says those who serve our military learn what it means to be committed to something bigger than they are, and they understand how to really show up at the office.  At the end of the day, John Ratzenberger says that his passion in life is simple, it's America. He wants to bring back improvisation, real fame, creators, and those who are willing to fall and get back up, because these are the roots upon which America was built. He says technology and innovation are absolutely keys to advancement, but so too is teaching new generations of kids the skills that were required to make us great in the first place. Cliff Clavin, the famous postman on Cheers once said in true Cliff know-it-all fashion, ""Everyone in the Swiss Army owns a Swiss Army Knife. That's why no one messes with Switzerland."" Peel back a few layers and you find John Ratzenberger believes simply that if everyone in America really knew how America was made, nobody would mess with America."

The brief from Democrats comes after Republican lawmakers filed a brief in February in which they argued the Environmental Protection Agency does not have the authority to enforce the regulation it crafted.Democrats, including Senate and House Minority Leaders Harry Reid (Nev.) and Nancy Pelosi (Calif.), wrote in their brief that opponents' reading of the Clean Air Act, ""fundamentally misunderstands"" the law and the ""authority it confers on EPA.""""When Congress amended the CAA in 1970, it was acutely aware of the serious and evolving problem posed by air pollution,"" the lawmakers wrote, adding that the law passed in response to that threat was meant to ""effect a major change"" in how the U.S. solved it.The brief goes on to explain that in certain provisions of the CAA, Congress was intentionally vague to give EPA a ""key role"" in shaping and developing standards for sources and pollutants. ""The rule that petitioners challenge is entirely consistent with the text, structure, and history of the CAA and ... advances the objectives Congress set out to accomplish in the CAA,"" the lawmakers wrote. In February, the Supreme Court granted a stay to those opposing the landmark regulation, allowing the lower court's proceedings to play out. While the stay in practice puts a hold on implementation, it does not mean the high court will ultimately strike it down.The EPA and administration remain confident that the rule will survive all legal challenges, and dismissed concerns that the stay could push back goalposts set under the plan. States don't have to submit plans until 2018. "
8,POLITICS,HUFFPOLLSTER: Voters Are Giving More Thought Than Ever To This Election,"Natalie Jackson, Ariel Edwards-Levy, and Janie Velencia",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/voter-attention-2016-race_us_56fe6c1ae4b083f5c6076331,"Those thoughts might be “this is crazy,” but they’re thinking about it.",2016-04-01,http://www.people-press.org/files/2016/03/overview_1.png, http://www.people-press.org/files/2016/03/overview_1.png,"Voters' interest in the presidential race is at a record level. Donald Trump could divide the Republican Party. And the Wisconsin primary is looking good for Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders while the New York primary favors Trump and Hillary Clinton. This is HuffPollster for Friday, April 1, 2016. ATTENTION TO THE ELECTION REACHES AN ALL-TIME HIGH - Pew Research: “Fully 85% of registered voters say they have given a lot of thought to the 2016 election. That is not only greater interest than at comparable points in recent campaigns, it is the highest level of interest measured at any point in all elections since 1988. Fully 89% of Republican and Republican-leaning registered voters say they are giving a lot of thought to the election, compared with 82% of Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters. At this stage in the 2012 campaign, when only the GOP had a contested nomination, 71% of Republicans and 64% of Democrats said they were giving a lot of thought to the election.” [Pew]The only comparable election was 2008 - Eight years ago, when both parties had competitive primaries, 78 percent of voters were paying serious attention to the election.. In the spring of 2000, less than half of voters had given the election a lot of thought, despite nomination contests for both parties. CLINTON AND TRUMP SUPPORTERS SEE THE WORLD DIFFERENTLY- HuffPollster: ""Supporters of Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton...differ most notably on whether life is improving or getting worse for people like them.There’s a significant gap just between the two parties, with Republicans 38 points more likely than Democrats to say things are getting worse. But the gulf is even wider between Trump supporters, who are the most pessimistic, and Clinton supporters, who are the most personally optimistic...Not coincidentally, disaffection with society’s direction is most pronounced among the demographic groups where Trump holds the most appeal. A 54 percent majority of white voters believe life is getting worse for people like them, as do 60 percent of whites who haven’t completed college. In contrast, black voters, who have formed the base of Clinton’s support in many primaries, have the sunniest outlook of any demographic group, with 58 percent saying that things have improved."" [HuffPost]TRUMP WOULD BE A HISTORICALLY UNPOPULAR NOMINEE- HuffPollster: ""If he wins the GOP nomination, Trump wouldn’t be the first nominee to enter a general election with negative ratings. He would, however, be the least popular major party nominee in modern times.....The American public’s view of Trump, which improved briefly after he entered the race, seems to be worsening...Conventional wisdom holds that there’s little room for a well-known, disliked candidate to improve. But Trump has defied conventional wisdom before…. if Trump is chosen as the nominee, he may well see another boost as recalcitrant GOP voters ultimately decide to rally around him, giving him a version of the post-convention bounce candidates traditionally receive….But for Trump to turn around his historically low ratings at this point would require a historically sized shift. "" [HuffPost] A Trump nomination could divide the party - Pew Research: ""GOP voters also are skeptical that the party will unite behind Trump if he is the party’s nominee. Just 38% say the party would 'unite solidly' behind Trump, while 56% say disagreements within the party would keep many Republicans from supporting him. That is much lower than the share of Republican voters who expected the party to unite behind Mitt Romney (65%) and John McCain (64%) at comparable points in the 2012 and 2008 nomination campaigns. By contrast, most Democratic voters (64%) think their party will solidly unite behind Clinton if she is the nominee. In March 2008, about as many Democrats (66%) said the party would unite behind Barack Obama if he won the Democratic nomination. [Pew] CRUZ AND SANDERS LEAD IN WISCONSIN - Dana Blanton: ""[Ted] Cruz garners 42 percent among Wisconsin likely GOP primary voters, while Trump receives 32 percent. John Kasich comes in third with 19 percent…. There is a big gender gap. Women back Cruz over Trump by a 19-point margin (46-27 percent). The two candidates are much closer among men: Cruz gets 40 percent to Trump’s 35 percent. Cruz’s advantage over the real estate mogul also comes from self-described 'very' conservative voters, who give him a 36-point lead...Bernie Sanders is ahead of Hillary Clinton by a 48-43 percent margin in the race for the Democratic nomination in Wisconsin….Sanders owes his advantage -- which is within the poll’s margin of error -- to young voters and men"" [Fox results for Republicans, Fox results for Democrats] TRUMP AND CLINTON HAVE BIG LEADS IN NEW YORK - Quinnipiac University: ""[Hillary] Clinton tops Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont 54 – 42 percent while [Donald] Trump leads among Republicans with 56 percent, followed by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas at 20 percent and Ohio Gov. John Kasich with 19 percent….New York remains solidly blue as either Clinton or Sanders top any Republican in the head-to-head general election matchups….In New York State’s GOP primary, men go 63 percent for Trump, 18 percent for Kasich and 16 percent for Cruz. Women go 48 percent for Trump, 25 percent for Cruz and 21 percent for Kasich….There are gender and racial gaps in the Democratic primary as women pick Clinton over Sanders 59 – 37 percent, while men go 49 percent for Sanders and 46 percent for Clinton...The gender gap carries into the Clinton-Trump matchup as women back Clinton 60 – 27 percent while men go 45 percent for Clinton and 41 percent for Trump.""

In a 3-2 decision, the Federal Communications Commission agreed on Thursday to grant a monthly Internet subsidy to Americans who already receive certain federal welfare benefits.The ruling updates the decades-old Lifeline program, which helps subsidize communications services for poor Americans. Those eligible for the new subsidy of $9.25 per month can use it to buy stand-alone broadband services or bundled voice and data packages, according to the FCC.Currently, about 15 percent of Americans don't use the Internet. For many, that's out of necessity, and this update can help them. However, it won't be enough to bridge significant inequalities in digital technology use, warn experts such as Blanca Gordo, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at the University of California, Berkeley. The ruling ""is a step in the right direction,"" she told The Huffington Post. ""But it's insufficient to address what is a much more complex problem.""When low-income Americans have Internet access, it's often very slow or shared among too many people. Many poor Americans use the Internet exclusively on smartphones, which can make it difficult for them to perform complicated online tasks like submitting job applications, analysts say. And some people haven't had much experience using the Internet, so they can't really take advantage of access when they do get it. ""That’s the division here,"" Gordo said. ""What [people with low incomes] don’t have is the training, assistance and teaching needed to enter a complex system that is thought of as easy to use from the perspective of a long-term user.""""The learning curve is huge,"" she added. Internet providers for people using the subsidy must offer a minimum download speed of 10 Mbps, which is what most consumers use, according to the FCC. The updated Lifeline program's budget is capped at $2.25 billion, which officials say is enough to support increased participation in the program. "

John Kasich (R) is running as the ""nice guy"" in the Republican presidential race. But at MSNBC’s recent GOP town hall, he made some nasty comments about black infant mortality rates in his state.After a question on criminal justice reform, NBC News host Chuck Todd asked Kasich to explain how his efforts in the black community could go further than policing and mass incarceration. Todd listed statistics including the state’s staggering income gap, that Ohio was deemed the sixth worst state to raise a black child by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and that Cleveland is considered one of the of the 10 most segregated cities in the U.S. Kasich, after saying he didn’t believe those statistics, listed his accomplishments as governor -- including school reform and job creation -- before oddly pivoting to infant mortality rates. ""The issue of infant mortality is a tough one. We have taken that on and one of the toughest areas to take on is in the minority community,"" he said. ""And the community itself is going to have to have a better partnership with all of us to begin to solve that problem with infant mortality in the minority community, because we’re making gains in the majority community."" Ohio has the third highest rate of infant mortality in the nation -- and the main organization working to lower those rates had its funding cut by Kasich.Though Kasich expanded Medicaid, which brought health care to many low-income mothers, a lot of the gains were erased in February. That month he signed a bill to slash $1.3 million of state funding to Planned Parenthood and other organizations that ""perform or promote"" abortions (even though Ohio law already prevented state funds from covering abortions). The bill takes effect May 23. Among Planned Parenthood's services is Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies, the largest of 14 infant mortality programs in the state. “It is offensive to hear John Kasich tell black women what we should do with our bodies, though not at all surprising. John Kasich blames black women for infant mortality, while as Governor, he cuts programs that help black families in Ohio,” said Alencia Johnson, assistant director of constituency communications for the Planned Parenthood Action Fund in a statement. “Kasich has created a web of policies that foster unsafe environments for black families,” Johnson said. “It is Kasich who continues to ignore the needs of Ohioans. The black community recognizes the truth -- the problem is John Kasich.”The initiative focuses on reducing infant mortality rates in the black community. It routinely sends staffers to visit with black moms during their pregnancies and up until the child’s second birthday. “Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies” tackles hurdles common among at-risk moms by providing transportation to prenatal appointments and diapers, formula and other supplies. Over 2,800 new and expecting black mothers benefitted from the program in 2015. (Ohio Medicaid plans now attempt to do similar work by connecting pregnant women to ""enhanced care management"" and focusing resources on neighborhoods with high infant mortality rates, per the Kasich campaign.)Rob Nichols, a spokesman for the campaign, told The Huffington Post that because of the governor more than 300,000 women have access to health care in Ohio.""And I don't know of a universe where 2,800 is a bigger number than 300,000,"" he said.This piece has been updated to note Kasich's work to expand Medicaid in Ohio."

Ted Cruz. Even if Cruz wins by only a small margin, he'll automatically take all 18 state delegates and likely a good portion of district level delegates.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fe9a1f1500002a000b3d19.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Wisconsin's GOP primary may be crucial for Republicans hoping to stop Donald Trump from clinching the nomination outright, with recent polling giving them hope that Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) could pull off a significant win. The state has 42 delegates up for grabs, with 24 awarded by district and 18 going to the statewide winner. Even if Cruz wins by a small margin, he'll automatically take all 18 state delegates and likely a good portion of district level delegates. That would probably keep Trump below the level he needs to win a majority before the Republican convention.Of the six surveys taken of the race since March, all but one show Cruz ahead, with margins ranging between 1 and 10 points. Recent Marquette Law School and Fox News polls, both of which were conducted using live interviewers, each find Cruz with a relatively comfortable 10-point edge, up significantly from earlier in the year. Wisconsin's demographics -- light on evangelical voters, and heavy on those without a college degree -- would seem to make it natural territory for Trump.But the frustration GOP voters feel elsewhere seems to be largely lacking in the state.“There certainly is a distrust of Wash­ing­ton, but there’s a real­iz­a­tion that Re­pub­lic­an lead­er­ship can work and can listen,” Matt Batzel, the ex­ec­ut­ive dir­ect­or of the con­ser­vat­ive Amer­ic­an Ma­jor­ity, told National Journal. “So Trump’s mes­sage of clean­ing house and try­ing to be a com­plete out­sider rings a little bit hol­low.”Candidates and groups opposing Trump have poured a combined $3.8 million into advertising in Wisconsin, according to the AP, in comparison to the approximately $430,000 spent by Trump's campaign. Much of the state's political leadership have also weighed in against Trump, as has local talk radio. House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has repeatedly condemned the businessman's rhetoric. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who's overwhelmingly popular among Republican voters, threw his endorsement behind Cruz last week, and he is featured in TV ads for the Texas senator's campaign.“I just fundamentally believe if you look at the facts, you look at the numbers, that Ted Cruz is in the best position by far to both win the nomination of the Republican Party and then go on and defeat Hillary Clinton in the fall of this year,” Walker told Newsradio WTMJ, a Wisconsin station.Editor’s note: Donald Trump regularly incites political violence and is a serial liar, rampant xenophobe, racist, misogynist and birther who has repeatedly pledged to ban all Muslims — 1.6 billion members of an entire religion — from entering the U.S."

I am thankful that I no longer have to make the choice between faith and service to our nation.”After years of cutting his hair and shaving his face, Singh was finally granted a temporary accommodation in December. Assistant Army Secretary Debra Wada ordered tests in March to determine whether Singh could safely wear a helmet and gas mask if he had a turban, uncut hair and a beard.Thursday's decision by the Army states that Singh will not have to reapply for accommodation in the future. “In a political context where minorities are being marginalized and attacked routinely, it is critical that our nation's largest institutions and employers -- like the U.S. military -- show the country that America embraces diversity,"" Simran Jeet Singh, the Senior Religion Fellow for the Sikh Coalition, told The Huffington Post.He added, though, that this decision is just one step toward ending the discriminatory policies regarding article of faith for service members.In 2014, the U.S. military began taking steps to give individual troops greater freedom to wear turbans, head scarfs, yarmulkes and other religious clothing with their uniforms. A spokesman for the Sikh Coalition noted at the time that the religious accommodation would have to be approved each time a service member changed assignments and would default to the discretion of their commanders.Just two day's before the Army released its decision on Singh's case, three other Sikh soldiers filed a lawsuit seeking similar accommodations from the Army. With Singh's victory and the Army's promise to ""develop uniform standards,"" there may be hope for others in a similar predicament."

""The lack of treatment affects both people with HIV and the entire community, because whoever goes into jail comes back out.""According to the report, based on a Human Rights Watch study conducted from October 2014 to December 2015, only five of 104 parish jails regularly offer HIV tests to inmates on entry, as recommended by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The five parish jails identified in the report as offering HIV testing are publicly operated and are located in the parishes of New Orleans, Jefferson, East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge and Lafayette. Two of those jails allow inmates to opt in for testing, while the other three provide prisoners with the option to opt out of HIV tests.The report claims that even when someone is identified as HIV-positive, treatment is often delayed, interrupted, or denied altogether, and continuity of care outside the prison is, for the most part, nonexistent. Many inmates reported going months without medications and emerging from jail gravely ill. Some died soon after release.""I took sick ... I had flu, congestion, bumps on my skin, I lost a lot of weight,"" a 32-year-old man who spent two years in a parish jail without HIV medication told Human Rights Watch. ""I was scared. I was going through a crisis in there.""A 53-year-old mother of four who was held at an Ouachita Parish jail told the organization a similar story. She said jail authorities told her, ""You'd better get family or someone to bring those medications in, because you're not going to get them here.""Human Rights Watch said its investigators interviewed roughly 100 individuals for the study, including inmates, experts and jail officials.The main obstacle to testing and treatment is the cost, the organization said. HIV treatment can cost more than $50,000 per year.""Why don't we do routine HIV testing? We cannot afford to treat someone who was identified as HIV-positive,"" said S. Wright, a nursing director at Caddo Parish Correctional Center in Shreveport. ""It sounds cold, I know, but that is the reality.""Still, Human Rights Watch found that no parish jails were taking advantage of federal AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, which help pay for medications for people in pre-trial detention.

""The lack of treatment affects both people with HIV and the entire community, because whoever goes into jail comes back out.""According to the report, based on a Human Rights Watch study conducted from October 2014 to December 2015, only five of 104 parish jails regularly offer HIV tests to inmates on entry, as recommended by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The five parish jails identified in the report as offering HIV testing are publicly operated and are located in the parishes of New Orleans, Jefferson, East Baton Rouge, West Baton Rouge and Lafayette. Two of those jails allow inmates to opt in for testing, while the other three provide prisoners with the option to opt out of HIV tests.The report claims that even when someone is identified as HIV-positive, treatment is often delayed, interrupted, or denied altogether, and continuity of care outside the prison is, for the most part, nonexistent. Many inmates reported going months without medications and emerging from jail gravely ill. Some died soon after release.""I took sick ... I had flu, congestion, bumps on my skin, I lost a lot of weight,"" a 32-year-old man who spent two years in a parish jail without HIV medication told Human Rights Watch. ""I was scared. I was going through a crisis in there.""A 53-year-old mother of four who was held at an Ouachita Parish jail told the organization a similar story. She said jail authorities told her, ""You'd better get family or someone to bring those medications in, because you're not going to get them here.""Human Rights Watch said its investigators interviewed roughly 100 individuals for the study, including inmates, experts and jail officials.The main obstacle to testing and treatment is the cost, the organization said. HIV treatment can cost more than $50,000 per year.""Why don't we do routine HIV testing? We cannot afford to treat someone who was identified as HIV-positive,"" said S. Wright, a nursing director at Caddo Parish Correctional Center in Shreveport. ""It sounds cold, I know, but that is the reality.""Still, Human Rights Watch found that no parish jails were taking advantage of federal AIDS Drug Assistance Programs, which help pay for medications for people in pre-trial detention.

17,POLITICS,Bernie Sanders Says This Puerto Rico Rescue Package Would Just Make Things Worse,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/bernie-sanders-house-puerto-rico-bill_us_56fea86ce4b083f5c60791e8,"The House has proposed a Washington-based oversight board, and Sanders has taken a stronger stance against it than most Democrats.",2016-04-01,Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) speaks at a rally in the Bronx on March 31. Sanders has criticized a bill he believes would take freedoms from Puerto Rico ahead of New York's presidential primary on April 19. ,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fea9091500002a000b3d51.jpeg?cache=vnTJIZuewe&ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) on Friday issued a scathing condemnation of draft legislation in the House of Representatives that aims to provide Puerto Rico with financial relief, taking a harder stance than his congressional colleagues in what has otherwise been an amicable legislative process. Like many Democrats, the presidential hopeful singled out a provision that would establish a Washington-based federal oversight board to institute financial reforms in Puerto Rico. The island owes creditors $70 billion, and the bill says creating this board is a prerequisite for restructuring some of this debt and giving the territory access to other assistance.But by calling for the bill's outright defeat, Sanders appears to distinguish himself as a populist advocate of the territory's suffering residents.“Establishing an unelected oversight board that would be given the power to inflict even more economic pain on the 3.5 million American citizens in Puerto Rico would be a move in exactly the wrong direction,” Sanders said in a statement sent via his campaign. “It must be defeated.”Rep. Rob Bishop (R-Utah), chairman of the House Committee on Natural Resources -- which has jurisdiction over Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories -- led the drafting of the bill with the blessing of House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.).The bill says that a five-person federal oversight board would have the authority to audit the Puerto Rican government’s finances and “work with the government to create efficiencies and reforms,” according to a committee summary. If the board determined debt restructuring was “necessary"" but the territory and creditors couldn't agree to terms, it would facilitate a court-supervised restructuring process.Sanders, however, called for granting Puerto Rico the authority to extend federal bankruptcy protection to its municipalities. This would mean the territory wouldn't need to consult the board in order for it to enter a legal process that could force creditors to accept lower payments than what was originally owed -- a right enjoyed by the 50 states. The Supreme Court will rule on a local Puerto Rico bankruptcy law. Should they be deemed legally permissible, the territory likely would be able to circumvent some of the congressional strictures.“The people in Puerto Rico should not be asked to suffer even more, so that a handful of wealthy investors can become even wealthier,” Sanders said. “Moreover, if any of Puerto Rico’s debt was incurred in violation of its Constitution it must be immediately set aside.""Some economists, advocates and Puerto Rican lawmakers have also said the commonwealth should be able to nullify portions of its debt that were incurred in a breach of its Constitution, but U.S. politicians rarely invoke that argument. Sanders' comments were a marked contrast to the more measured disagreement from Democratic House leaders.House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement that the oversight board in its current form is “far from what Democrats can support,” but made clear that she is interested in working with Republicans toward a compromise.“We look forward to working with Speaker Ryan and Chairman Bishop to address the significant problems of this discussion draft, and to reach our goal of bipartisan, consensus legislation,” Pelosi added.The Obama administration, which has proposed offering Puerto Rico the power to restructure all of its debts, also offered tempered criticism of the bill. The “current draft needs improvements,"" the Treasury Department said in a statement. A group of House conservatives known as the Republican Study Committee criticized the bill for creating conditions that could make it too easy for Puerto Rico to restructure its debts and force losses on creditors.“The RSC has taken a clear position that unilaterally changing the rules to address Puerto Rico’s fiscal irresponsibility is the wrong approach,” group chairman Rep. Bill Flores (R-Texas) said in a statement.Groups representing the commonwealth's bondholders have voiced similar concerns. Sanders’ statement could be an attempt to position himself as a champion of Puerto Rico ahead of the April 19 Democratic presidential primary in New York, a state with one of the country’s largest Puerto Rican populations.Sanders currently trails Hillary Clinton in the state by 12 percentage points, according to HuffPost Pollster, down from a 31-point gap in the middle of March.Clinton in the past has expressed support for allowing Puerto Rico to grant its municipalities and public corporations access to federal bankruptcy protections. When asked about reactions to the new bill, the Clinton campaign directed The Huffington Post to a tweet expressing dissatisfaction with Congress' inaction in helping Puerto Rico:The debt crisis in Puerto Rico has prompted its government to adopt massive spending cuts and tax increases in recent years, which have made it virtually impossible for the island to recover economically. The commonwealth has an unemployment rate of nearly 12 percent, more than twice that of the mainland United States. The poor economy and loss of public services like hospitals and schools have prompted a mass exodus of the island’s residents, all of whom have U.S. citizenship, to the mainland.This article has been updated with comment from the Clinton campaign."

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, still refuses to give a hearing to President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee because Obama is a lame-duck president.It's only fair to wait until after the November elections, Grassley says, and let the next president fill the court vacancy.""Stated differently: The president should let the people decide,"" the Iowa Republican said last month on the Senate floor.But Jake Smith, a senior at Roosevelt High School in Des Moines, just blew a hole through the senator's argument. In an open letter published Wednesday in The Des Moines Register, Smith pointed out that by Grassley's own logic, he should step down as chairman of the Judiciary Committee during the Supreme Court debate. That's because he's a lame-duck politician, too.""You, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, carry significant power in determining who gets to become the next Supreme Court Justice,"" Smith writes. ""But senator, since you, too, are in an election year, how can you possess the authority to make a decision that will affect the future of our country if 'the people have not yet spoken?'""""Following the direction of the Republican’s logic, I politely ask you to step aside as chairman of the Senate Judiciary committee until the elections take place,"" he continues. A Grassley spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment.Smith told The Huffington Post on Friday that he was inspired to write the letter after he and his parents took a road trip through the Midwest to tour colleges. They listened to conservative radio as they drove, and heard one Republican senator after another say they wouldn't consider any Supreme Court pick from Obama. Smith decided to reach out to Grassley to point out the ""absurdity"" of denying a lame-duck president the chance to move a nominee.""I know he's not going to read this letter from an 18-year-old and say, 'Oh crap. I have to step down now,'"" Smith said. ""But I'm just trying to kind of match his ridiculous statements about this issue with another ridiculous statement.""Grassley is one of 24 GOP senators serving the sixth and final year of their term, and most of them echo the line about ""letting the people decide"" who should pick the next Supreme Court justice. HuffPost's Mike McAuliff asked some of them in February why they should be allowed to take consequential votes as lame-duck senators if Obama isn't allowed to make consequential appointments. They didn't have much to say.""It’s a ridiculous analogy, but I appreciate it,” said Sen. Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.), who is facing a tough re-election campaign against Gov. Maggie Hassan (D).To be sure, the real reason Republicans are blocking nominee Merrick Garland is that they don't want Obama to fill the Supreme Court seat. They'd rather hold out until 2017, when a Republican might be in the White House. But the GOP may be making things worse for itself by denying Garland a vote: Republicans run the risk of the party's front-runner, Donald Trump, naming a total wild-card nominee or Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton nominating someone far more liberal than Obama's moderate pick.As for Smith, he's still trying to figure out which college to attend next year. But he's already decided to major in political science. That wouldn't be a bad precursor to a Senate run, eh?""Maybe in a few years,"" he said."
19,BUSINESS,Women In Soccer Are Paid Even More Unfairly Than Women In General,Emily Peck,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/women-soccer-pay-gap_us_56fea6f3e4b083f5c60790c2,The national women's team is paid 40 percent less than the men's.,2016-04-01,Hope Solo is one of five members of the U.S. Women's national soccer team who have filed a complaint against the U.S. soccer federation alleging unfair pay.,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56feaa461e0000b300705fff.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Yes, in the U.S. women make less money than men on average. For every dollar a man makes, a woman makes 79 cents, according to census data.But even in light of that big pay gap, what’s happening with the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team stands out as particularly egregious.Women soccer players are making between 40 and 72 percent of what the male players are making, said Jeffrey Kessler, the lawyer representing the women’s team in a pay discrimination case filed Thursday against the U.S. Soccer Federation.“This is worse than the overall nationwide gap,"" Kessler told The Huffington Post. It would be like if you took all the employees of a company, and split them up into a women's office and a men's office and then paid each section completely differently, based entirely on gender, he said.The huge difference in pay appears to be due entirely to blatant discrimination. Female soccer players quite simply are being paid less for the same work. Indeed, considering the huge success the team has had -- they’re actually being paid less for superior work. That’s not quite what’s going on in the broader economy, where the situation is not as simple as unequal pay for equal work: The gap between what women and men earn can be explained by things other than discrimination. More than half of the gender pay gap in the U.S. can be attributed to the fact that men and women work in different jobs and industries, a recent research report from jobs site Glassdoor demonstrated.Of course, the reasons women and men choose different kinds of jobs and industries has a lot to do with sexism and the different kinds of expectations society has of girls (to be caretakers, or are bad at math) and boys (to be breadwinners, or are leaders), but this is distinct from overt discrimination.More men work in higher-paying industries while women dominate lower-wage industries. Eighty-four percent of chief executives in the U.S. are men; Ninety-five percent of hairdressers are women, according to labor department data from 2015. Even within industries, women tend to dominate the lower paying jobs -- in tech, for example, women tend to gravitate toward marketing while men dominate the technical roles.Another 14 percent of the gender pay gap is due to differences in education and experience between men and women, the Glassdoor report found. More women take time out of the labor force to care for kids or family: That hits them in the pocketbook.Even when men and women have the same jobs -- the women still wind up making less, because they choose work that is less time intensive and offers more flexibility for care-taking, separate research from Harvard economist Claudia Goldin has found. So for example, men become extremely high-paid lawyers at big law firms while women maybe take in-house legal positions at companies that require fewer hours, and pay slightly less.Once you take these things into account, plus other variables like age and location, the difference between what men and women make is “just” 5.4 cents, according to Glassdoor’s analysis -- an amount that lines up with previous studies of the pay gap. That remaining difference is probably due to a mix of workplace bias against women and probably women of color (Glassdoor did not consider race in its analysis). It’s a small but stubborn percentage, that economists have a difficult time explaining. Companies these days are under a lot of pressure to come clean about the way they pay men and women. But so far, the businesses who are talking about their pay gaps look nowhere near as terrible as U.S. soccer. Last year, cloud computing company Salesforce spent $3 million adjusting pay between men and women. Last month, Amazon -- responding to a request from activists -- announced it paid women 99.9 percent of what men made. Apple announced that it pays men more than women -- when taking into account stock-based compensation.What’s interesting though is that those firms are lagging far behind soccer in another measure of equity -- none employ equal numbers of women and men. They all have far more male leadership and more men in highly coveted technical roles. In soccer, women have unquestionably asserted their dominance. And yet by every measure women soccer players are paid less than men, according to the detailed complaint filed Thursday.The pay set-up is so skewed in the men’s favor that in 2015 the men’s team earned $9 million for simply making it to the round of 16 in their World Cup attempt. That same year, the women, WON the World Cup and pulled in $2 million.Even on the small things, women soccer players get shafted: Women get $50 to cover daily expenses when they’re on tour in the U.S., while men get $62.50.The U.S. Soccer Federation said in a statement early Thursday that it was disappointed by the complaint, but later in the day seemed to ease up a bit, and suggest it was willing to do more for its women players.""We think very highly of the women's national team and we want to compensate them fairly, and we'll sit down and work through that with them when all of this settles down,"" Sunil Gulati, the president of the organization, said Thursday night."

Policy adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters Thursday to expect ""extensive"" campaigning by Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, and said specific places they'll visit will be announced in the coming days.Upstate New York is not an area that usually gets much attention during a presidential campaign. Places like Potsdam, Canton and Little Falls all received mentions on a Clinton campaign press call Thursday evening, as aides hammer the message that Clinton likes New York, and New Yorkers liked her, too. ""The next two weeks are going to be a pretty exciting time from her perspective ... a time when she gets to reconnect with people she's worked very closely with,"" Sullivan said. The press call felt more like something for a Senate campaign than a presidential campaign -- and that was the point.

She famously launched a ""listening tour"" that took her to all 62 counties in New York. (The Wall Street Journal said she ""bounced around upstate New York like a FedEx delivery truck run amok."") Back then, many voters were surprised that she was putting in the work to learn about all corners of the state. ""No candidate ever, ever comes here. Ever. Ever,"" Barbara Steinwachs, a resident of Penn Yan, a village of just over 5,000 people, told the New York Times at the time. ""People are thrilled. And to have it to be the first lady makes it even more thrilling. I think people are impressed just that she came."" Clinton ended up winning over many upstate New York voters, depriving her Republican opponent of the votes he needed to beat her in the part of the state that is traditionally more conservative. And during her tenure as senator from 2001-2009, she remained popular. Rather than coming into the Senate and making a big splash, she kept her head down and focused on issues of concern to New York -- and that's the record that she and her campaign will try to invoke in advance of the April 19 primary.""[Sanders] is going to campaign like a Brooklynite, and she’s going to campaign like a senator who represented this state for eight years and has lived here for 16,"" Joel Benenson, Clinton's top strategist, told reporters Monday.""She is going to be making a larger case here,"" Sullivan added Thursday. ""And that larger case is built on the proposition that she believes she is the only candidate in the race on either side who can actually set forth a vision for where she wants to take this country and prove to people that she can get there -- that she can actually deliver that outcome and make that difference in people's lives that is going to improve things for them.""But Sanders isn't going to give up New York without a fight. He was born in Brooklyn, and the state has a strong base of progressives who are drawn to his message. The Sanders campaign also believes that his economic message could resonate with the voters who have seen jobs disappear in the state. In recent days, Sanders has cut steadily into Clinton's lead.Losing New York would be a major blow to Clinton symbolically, even if it doesn't significantly hurt her in her delegate lead against Sanders. The state, which is solidly Democratic in presidential elections, could also take on outsized importance in the general election if Donald Trump wins the GOP nomination. The New York native's first congressional endorsement came from Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), who represents a district encompassing the suburbs and rural areas outside Buffalo. Trump currently has a sizable lead in the state ahead of the GOP primary this month. "

Back then, many voters were surprised that she was putting in the work to learn about all corners of the state. ""No candidate ever, ever comes here. Ever. Ever,"" Barbara Steinwachs, a resident of Penn Yan, a village of just over 5,000 people, told the New York Times at the time. ""People are thrilled. And to have it to be the first lady makes it even more thrilling. I think people are impressed just that she came."" Clinton ended up winning over many upstate New York voters, depriving her Republican opponent of the votes he needed to beat her in the part of the state that is traditionally more conservative. And during her tenure as senator from 2001-2009, she remained popular. Rather than coming into the Senate and making a big splash, she kept her head down and focused on issues of concern to New York -- and that's the record that she and her campaign will try to invoke in advance of the April 19 primary.""[Sanders] is going to campaign like a Brooklynite, and she’s going to campaign like a senator who represented this state for eight years and has lived here for 16,"" Joel Benenson, Clinton's top strategist, told reporters Monday.""She is going to be making a larger case here,"" Sullivan added Thursday. ""And that larger case is built on the proposition that she believes she is the only candidate in the race on either side who can actually set forth a vision for where she wants to take this country and prove to people that she can get there -- that she can actually deliver that outcome and make that difference in people's lives that is going to improve things for them.""But Sanders isn't going to give up New York without a fight. He was born in Brooklyn, and the state has a strong base of progressives who are drawn to his message. The Sanders campaign also believes that his economic message could resonate with the voters who have seen jobs disappear in the state. In recent days, Sanders has cut steadily into Clinton's lead.Losing New York would be a major blow to Clinton symbolically, even if it doesn't significantly hurt her in her delegate lead against Sanders. The state, which is solidly Democratic in presidential elections, could also take on outsized importance in the general election if Donald Trump wins the GOP nomination. The New York native's first congressional endorsement came from Rep. Chris Collins (R-N.Y.), who represents a district encompassing the suburbs and rural areas outside Buffalo. Trump currently has a sizable lead in the state ahead of the GOP primary this month. "

27,SPORTS,Paying Women's Soccer Players Fairly Doesn't Even Begin To Rectify The Discrimination Problem,Shane Ferro,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/paying-women-soccer-fairly-is-just-the-tip-of-the-iceberg_us_56febe59e4b083f5c607ab18,Fairness starts with investment. And that’s true across all professional sports.,2016-04-01,"Exclusive image of the author, on the internet today. (But this is actually a photo of Carli Lloyd.)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/56fed2c71e00008700706054.jpeg?ops=crop_0_327_3048_1562%2Cscalefit_720_noupscale,"Every once in a while as a writer you really put your foot in your mouth.This week five of the players from the United States women's national soccer team filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission alleging unfair wage discrimination.Last year, at the height of the time that the team was busy raking in millions in revenue for their sport, I wrote a post titled ""Here's why it's fair that female athletes make less than men."" Right off the bat I'd like to say the headline is wrong and unfortunate. No question. But do I stand behind the post? Yes and no. First off, the details of the players' complaint make it fairly clear that their pay is highly discriminatory. I would never dream of arguing otherwise. It says right in the filing that the women contributed millions more in revenue to the U.S. Soccer organization than the men did. Yet they are still paid less. Pro soccer players who are women earn between 40 and 70 percent what the men do. That is not fair. That said, U.S. women's soccer is one of the few examples where the women's side of the sport is more popular than the men's at the professional level. Most women's sports don't work like that.In the vast majority of sports, although not in U.S. Soccer, women athletes bring in much less revenue than men. And even in soccer, despite the women's popularity, female athletes get fewer sponsorship deals than their male counterparts. Using a certain obtuse logic, it's then fair to pay women athletes less -- although please don't mistake me writing ""fair"" with me meaning ""correct.""But pay is only a symptom of the real problem, which is that no one has ever invested enough in women's professional sports. It's true of soccer, but also basketball, baseball and softball, and my personal favorite, cycling. Women are not less interesting to watch. They are not less talented (have you ever seen Serena Williams play tennis?!). The numbers that appear in the U.S. women's soccer team complaint prove that with the right exposure -- meaning marketing dollars and plenty of air time -- female professional athletes are just as successful at bringing in revenue, if not more so, than their male counterparts. The 2015 women's soccer World Cup got twice as many viewers in English as the men's version did just a year earlier (see tweet below). Yet, the women couldn't even find enough sponsorship to cover the cost of the New York City ticker-tape parade held in their honor after their World Cup win. (The city eventually covered the cost.)In soccer and every other sport out there, the women playing professionally don't get the investment they need to make them popular. As I said six months ago:So many professional women’s sports initiatives are set up to fail because they don’t have enough support from the beginning. Sponsors set up shop for a year or two, then bolt when they don’t see immediate returns, which sends teams and leagues into survival mode almost from the beginning. Take, for example, the case of the Velocio-SRAM women's cycling team, one of the best teams in their field. Velocio-SRAM was forced to disband at the end of 2015 due to a lack of consistent sponsorship. The previous year, the team's manager even had to launch a crowdfunding campaign in an attempt to supplement the team's budget. That is the heart of discrimination in sports. And fair pay doesn't even begin to fix it."

But, ironically, his comment, made in an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews -- which seems to be closer to his real opinion than his clumsy recanting hours later -- inadvertently expresses more respect for women and their capacity for decision-making than the alternative position taken by anti-abortion groups, who insist patients would face no legal repercussions if abortion was illegal because they inevitably would have been coerced into it by outside forces. Both positions, of course, are designed to restrict reproductive freedom, but among the two, at least Trump, to his credit, was suggesting that women are independent thinking people with their own agency, and as such should be held accountable for their decisions. The Huffington Post interviewed Eric Scheidler, the executive director of the Pro-Life Action League, about Trump’s comments on Thursday, and asked if he was concerned that Trump, of all people, seemed to be the relative feminist in the situation. “I am concerned about that,"" Scheidler acknowledged. ""He's a strange source for a statement on behalf of women’s co-equality with men."" In the interview, he inched closer to Trump's position. ""I’m not saying that every woman who walks into an abortion clinic is deluded and being lied to and a fool,"" he said. Scheidler had previously put out a statement saying that ""women suffer from abortion"" and ""are lied to by the abortion industry,"" and women ""turn to them in desperation.”Characterizing abortion patients as victims preyed upon by providers ignores the reality that women often take matters into their own hands and order medication abortion pills online to self-induce. In such a case, there are no doctors to prosecute as the patient and the abortion provider are one and the same. And women have indeed been prosecuted for doing so in the U.S., despite what you may have thought after the outrage at Trump's position. (For more information about these cases, read this story about Pennsylvania’s prosecution of Jennifer Whalen by The New York Times’ Emily Bazelon and this story about Indiana’s prosecution of Purvi Patel by MSNBC’s Irin Carmon.)HuffPost asked Scheidler what happens when there’s no doctor in the mix if abortion was illegal. Scheidler argued “there needs to be some sort of legal intervention,” suggesting perhaps a social worker could meet with the woman.I don’t think jail time makes a lot of sense, because it will disincentivize women getting the medical care they need, if something goes wrong with that self-induced abortion, which after all is how we know about these few cases that have been prosecuted.Scheidler’s right that criminalizing abortion will “disincentivize women getting the medical care they need,” since abortion is medical care. But we don’t even have to imagine what that world would look like, since we already saw it in Tennessee, where a soon-to-be-defunct law allowing women to be charged with assault if they use narcotics while pregnant led women to avoid seeking prenatal care out of fear of being prosecuted. But Scheidler and the movement's argument about regret -- though 95 percent of women don’t regret their abortion -- also raises thorny questions. HuffPost noted to Scheidler that most people who commit murder feel remorse over what they've done, either immediately after or for years to come, or both. But society still punishes them, so why should women be treated differently? Pragmatically, Scheidler said, there's really no other choice. There’s really nothing like the relationship between a mother and her unborn child ... who is directly threatening your perception of your well-being in a way that no other person ever really could. It’s a really unusual relationship. Ultimately, said Scheidler, the world he's talking about is a far different one from today's. Abortions will be illegal, meaning that by definition any woman trying to get one will be in some sort of desperate situation.""In a world in which abortion were illegal, in which the social and political climate enabled that type of a law to exist and be accepted by a majority of the people,"" he said, ""in that world there’s going to be an element of desperation and coercion, whether by another person or by circumstances of life, to any illegal abortion."" It's a neat trick: by creating horrible, back-alley conditions that threaten the lives of women who seek unsafe abortions, the movement can then say, well, any woman who'd seek an abortion in such a situation must be crazy.

Arslan has worked for an outlet linked to a U.S.-based Muslim cleric who is an enemy of Erdoğan, according to The Associated Press.Another Turkish journalist, Emre Uslu, told The Guardian that Erdoğan's security guards kicked him in the knee so hard he bled.

She's also been criticized by her own Democratic primary opponent for taking campaign contributions from the loan industry.Asked by WTAE's Jackie Cain if his opposition to the party's chairwoman was ""a bold move,"" Fetterman, a decidedly non-traditional politician, said it was more a matter of common decency.""I wouldn't call it a bold move. I would call it an appropriate one given her collusion with the sub-prime, payday loan, lending machine,"" Fetterman said. ""I can't imagine -- the average interest rate they charge is 309 percent -- as a Democrat, how could you get in bed with those kind of people?""He also pointed to her campaign's donors.""The fact that she would take tens of thousands of dollars from that industry, and the fact that she would try to pass legislation that benefits that industry -- it's deeply disappointing particularly for the head of the DNC,"" Fetterman said.The DNC's press office did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment, but Wasserman Schultz's campaign told HuffPost last month that she was looking out for Florida, and thought Florida's payday loan law was a good one.“As a state lawmaker, she helped write Florida’s law that has sharply reduced the need to go to bad actors, curbed predatory practices and created standards and protections for low-income borrowers,” spokesman Sean Bartlett said in a statement. “The Congresswoman wants to work with the CFPB on the way forward, and believes the Florida law is an example of how to achieve their shared goals of balancing strong consumer protections with preserving access to credit in underserved communities.”Fetterman is not well-known in most of Pennsylvania, and is currently third in most polls for the seat's Democratic primary, trailing former Rep. Joe Sestak as well as the faltering Democratic Party-endorsed candidate, Katie McGinty, a former aide to Gov. Tom Wolf. Fetterman still sees a chance, however, because few Pennsylvania voters say their minds are made up.Watch Fetterman's comments on Wasserman Schultz below, and the full interview on WTAE."

And if laced with truth, just how much of the New World did the Norse really explore?In the 1960s, archaeologists determined that a site on the northernmost tip of Newfoundland in Canada -- L'Anse aux Meadows -- had been a Viking settlement, established about a millennium before. The discovery changed the history of European exploration in the New World and proved the sagas were not simply works of fiction.L’Anse aux Meadows, however, had merely been a temporary settlement, which the Norse abandoned after a few short years. Archaeologists have since been searching for clues of other Viking expeditions in North America; but in the past half-century, nothing concrete has been found.Until now.Thanks largely to the work of Sarah Parcak, a leading space archaeologist, evidence has been unearthed of a possible second Viking site in North America -- and it’s located about 300 miles further south than L’Anse aux Meadows.The site at Point Rosee, which Parcak pinpointed after analyzing satellite imagery, is located on the southwest coast of Newfoundland, The New York Times reports.“I am absolutely thrilled,” she told the BBC of the new find. “Typically in archaeology, you only ever get to write a footnote in the history books, but what we seem to have at Point Rosee may be the beginning of an entirely new chapter.”“This new site could unravel more secrets about the Vikings, whether they were the first Europeans to ‘occupy’ briefly in North America, and reveal that the Vikings dared to explore much further into the New World than we ever thought,” added Parcak, who won the $1 million TED prize last year for her pioneering work using satellite data for archaeological purposes.Last summer, Parcak and a team of archaeologists conducted a test excavation at Point Rosee, and uncovered an “iron-working hearth [and some cooked bog iron] partially surrounded by the remains of what appears to have been a turf wall,” The National Geographic reports. The team said they can’t yet say for certain that the Vikings built the hearth, but the signs are encouraging. The turf wall is “nothing like the shelters built by indigenous peoples who lived in Newfoundland at the time, nor by Basque fishermen and whalers who arrived in the 16th century,"" according to Nat Geo. And Douglas Bolender, an archaeologist who specializes in Viking settlements, said there “aren’t any known cultures -- prehistoric or modern -- that would have been mining and roasting bog iron ore in Newfoundland other than the Norse.” Bolender told the BBC that the Point Rosee discovery “has the potential to change history.”“The sagas suggest a short period of activity and a very brief and failed colonization attempt. L’Anse aux Meadows fits well with that story but is only one site. Point Rosee could reinforce that story or completely change it if the dating is different from L’Anse aux Meadows. We could end up with a much longer period of Norse activity in the New World,” he told Nat Geo.One of the reasons why the Vikings have been so hard to track down is because of the way they moved around.“They travelled light and left nothing behind, No massive stone theatres for them. They voyaged in longships with a strong oak keel ... [and] sails spun from wool,"" historian Dan Snow writes for the BBC. ""Food was pickled herring, lamb smoked using reindeer droppings, fermented salmon. Almost everything on a Viking ship would get recycled or rot away.”But, thanks to satellite imagery, Parcak believes that even the elusive Vikings can be found.In the case of Point Rosee, for instance, it had been irregularities in the soil -- “a dark stain,” according to the Times -- that initially piqued her interest. “For a long time, serious North Atlantic archaeologists have largely ignored the idea of looking for Norse sites in coastal Canada because there was no real method for doing so,” Bolender told Nat Geo. “If Sarah Parcak can find one Norse site using satellites, then there’s a reasonable chance that you can use the same method to find more, if they exist. If Point Rosee is Norse, it may open up coastal Canada to a whole new era of research.”Parcak’s Point Rosee findings will be explored in greater detail in the two-hour television documentary, “NOVA: Vikings Unearthed,” that will premiere online on Monday at 3:30 p.m. EDT and will be broadcast in the U.S. on Wednesday, April 6, on PBS at 9 p.m. EDT."

Archaeologists have since been searching for clues of other Viking expeditions in North America; but in the past half-century, nothing concrete has been found.Until now.Thanks largely to the work of Sarah Parcak, a leading space archaeologist, evidence has been unearthed of a possible second Viking site in North America -- and it’s located about 300 miles further south than L’Anse aux Meadows.The site at Point Rosee, which Parcak pinpointed after analyzing satellite imagery, is located on the southwest coast of Newfoundland, The New York Times reports.“I am absolutely thrilled,” she told the BBC of the new find. “Typically in archaeology, you only ever get to write a footnote in the history books, but what we seem to have at Point Rosee may be the beginning of an entirely new chapter.”“This new site could unravel more secrets about the Vikings, whether they were the first Europeans to ‘occupy’ briefly in North America, and reveal that the Vikings dared to explore much further into the New World than we ever thought,” added Parcak, who won the $1 million TED prize last year for her pioneering work using satellite data for archaeological purposes.Last summer, Parcak and a team of archaeologists conducted a test excavation at Point Rosee, and uncovered an “iron-working hearth [and some cooked bog iron] partially surrounded by the remains of what appears to have been a turf wall,” The National Geographic reports. The team said they can’t yet say for certain that the Vikings built the hearth, but the signs are encouraging. The turf wall is “nothing like the shelters built by indigenous peoples who lived in Newfoundland at the time, nor by Basque fishermen and whalers who arrived in the 16th century,"" according to Nat Geo. And Douglas Bolender, an archaeologist who specializes in Viking settlements, said there “aren’t any known cultures -- prehistoric or modern -- that would have been mining and roasting bog iron ore in Newfoundland other than the Norse.” Bolender told the BBC that the Point Rosee discovery “has the potential to change history.”“The sagas suggest a short period of activity and a very brief and failed colonization attempt. L’Anse aux Meadows fits well with that story but is only one site. Point Rosee could reinforce that story or completely change it if the dating is different from L’Anse aux Meadows. We could end up with a much longer period of Norse activity in the New World,” he told Nat Geo.One of the reasons why the Vikings have been so hard to track down is because of the way they moved around.“They travelled light and left nothing behind, No massive stone theatres for them. They voyaged in longships with a strong oak keel ... [and] sails spun from wool,"" historian Dan Snow writes for the BBC. ""Food was pickled herring, lamb smoked using reindeer droppings, fermented salmon. Almost everything on a Viking ship would get recycled or rot away.”But, thanks to satellite imagery, Parcak believes that even the elusive Vikings can be found.In the case of Point Rosee, for instance, it had been irregularities in the soil -- “a dark stain,” according to the Times -- that initially piqued her interest. “For a long time, serious North Atlantic archaeologists have largely ignored the idea of looking for Norse sites in coastal Canada because there was no real method for doing so,” Bolender told Nat Geo. “If Sarah Parcak can find one Norse site using satellites, then there’s a reasonable chance that you can use the same method to find more, if they exist. If Point Rosee is Norse, it may open up coastal Canada to a whole new era of research.”Parcak’s Point Rosee findings will be explored in greater detail in the two-hour television documentary, “NOVA: Vikings Unearthed,” that will premiere online on Monday at 3:30 p.m. EDT and will be broadcast in the U.S. on Wednesday, April 6, on PBS at 9 p.m. EDT."
