The event, in its 7th year, included speeches and a concert, while 28,000 participants formed a gigantic human pink dot after night fall, the organizer said.The event's spokesman, Paerin Choa, somberly recounted the challenges the gay rights movement had encountered over the past year, including a court decision to uphold a law criminalizing sexual acts between men.Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said last week that the country was not ready for same-sex marriage, while a ""Wear White"" movement started by religious groups to counter Pink Dot has entered its second year.""I hope that they will legalize gay marriage,"" said a 20-year-old Danish man, holding up a pink sign with a friend to offer free hugs near a subway exit on the edge of the park.""Many people have been in the closet for a long time, and perhaps they shouldn't be afraid,"" he said, adding he had not told his parents of his homosexuality but friends had been supportive.The government has always insisted that Singapore is a conservative society.Yet one sign of more support for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community is the growing corporate sponsorship for the event.

AFP PHOTO/Emmanuel Dunand (Photo credit should read EMMANUEL DUNAND/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc14ff6240000130a51ba73.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ATHENS/BRUSSELS, June 13 (Reuters) - Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said he was willing to accept unpalatable compromises to secure a deal with international creditors provided he gets debt relief in return, something that Germany refuses to countenance.With Greece heading towards possible default and bankruptcy, he told his negotiating team before it took a counter-proposal to Brussels that without debt relief he would reject any settlement that isolates his country from the rest of Europe.In little more than a fortnight, Athens must repay 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion) to the International Monetary Fund with money it does not have.Greek ministers arrived in Brussels on Saturday to resume negotiations on a cash-for-reforms deal with the EU and IMF creditors that ended in stalemate on Thursday.The counter-proposal offering concessions on budget issues is designed to break the deadlock that is threatening Greece's future in the euro zone.Tsipras, who was elected in January on promises to end austerity, made it clear he was willing to give ground but with strings attached that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is unlikely to accept.""If we have a sustainable solution, regardless of how difficult the compromise is, we will bear the burden because the only criteria are exiting the crisis and the bailouts,"" a government official quoted Tsipras as telling the ministers on Friday night before they headed to Brussels.Tsipras used the term ""sustainable solution"" to refer to a long-standing demand for large parts of Greece's mountainous debts to be written off or rescheduled - something he believes is vital if the Greek economy is to start getting back on its feet after a six-year depression.Much of that debt is owed to Germany, the biggest contributor to Greece's 240 billion euro bailouts. Any acceptance by Merkel that the money might never be paid back would almost certainly create uproar among the country's politicians and taxpayers.EU officials question Greek assertions that the debt is asphyxiating the economy. The government's immediate problems are with repaying loans from the IMF and European Central Bank while privately held debt is relatively modest following a major write-down in 2012.The bulk of the debt is European bailout loans but Athens does not have to start repaying these until 2023. The debt is accruing interest, meaning that it will grow over the next eight years, but the annual rate is below what Italy pays and in any case the interest payments also begin only in 2023.Nevertheless, Tsipras appears to be seeking a gesture on debt from Europe that will allow him to sell a harsh deal to his radical left Syriza party and Greek voters.Tsipras signaled that without debt relief, he would reject any deal involving curbs on the right of Greek workers to bargain collectively on pay - something that union members elsewhere take for granted.""If Europe desires the split and the continuation of subjugation, we will make the big decision to say 'no' and fight the battle for the dignity of the people and our national sovereignty,"" he said.PSYCHOLOGICAL PRESSUREGovernment spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis gave more details on the negotiating stand, such as on the primary surplus - a budget balance that excludes debt repayments - and the creditors' demands for yet more of the austerity that has already radically reduced Greeks' living standards.""The government seeks a solution which will include a debt relief, low primary surpluses, no wage and pension cuts, an investment package and restarting the economy,"" he told Agora newspaper.""Debt relief is not an ideological obsession or a symbolic move, but a necessary condition to relieve people and jumpstart the economy,"" he added.The Greek delegation, led by the deputy prime minister and chief negotiator, met European Commission and ECB officials in Brussels for low-key talks late on Saturday afternoon.On Friday, EU officials said representatives of euro zone member states had formally discussed a series of scenarios, including for the first time one which involved a possible Greek default on the repayment to the IMF due by the end of June.Athens, which attended a meeting of the official-level Euro Working Group on Thursday, has denied that any such scenario had come up.Defaulting on a repayment to the IMF, the global lender of last resort, would have profound consequences. The ECB would probably have to halt emergency lending that supports Greek banks, which have suffered huge withdrawals by anxious savers.Athens would then probably have to impose capital controls on deposit withdrawals and payments abroad in a series of events that would put Greece's future in the euro in grave danger.But Sakellaridis dismissed such a scenario. ""The Greek banking system is steady and solvent, which is being proven every day. Any other theories are just part of the negotiation, a form of (mainly psychological) pressure.""Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis proposed a debt swap involving the ESM, Europe's bailout mechanism, to help Athens meet a further 6.7 billion euros that it must repay to the ECB in July and August.Varoufakis played down any possibility of Greece being forced out of the euro. ""It is also possible that a comet will hit planet Earth,"" he told BBC radio. ""(But) I don't believe that any sensible European bureaucrat or politician will go down that road.""Asked if the EU and IMF were bluffing, he said: ""I hope they are.""

The 33-year-old pop star told Queerty’s Jeremy Kinser that he was asked to follow in the footsteps of Neil Patrick Harris and Andrew Rannells as the star of “Hedwig and the Angry Inch,” but opted not to pursue the title role because of its physical (and cosmetic) demands.“I’m flattered they asked me, but it’s not what I want to do right now,” Lambert said. Still, he hasn’t ruled out playing the part of the East German “slip of a girlyboy,” which nabbed Harris a Tony Award in 2014, entirely: “Maybe one day. The thing about it is I don’t want to get in drag for eight shows a week.” The “American Idol” alum’s decision to turn down the part is certainly understandable given his current schedule. His new album, “The Original High,” will drop June 16, while its first single, “Ghost Town,” is already generating buzz for its ‘90s house vibe. (It also happens to share a title with a new Madonna song.) The dance-pop feel of “The Original High” should endear the album to Lambert’s gay fan base in a way that his first two albums, “For Your Entertainment” and “Trespassing,” did not. “I wanted this one to reflect my real life, not only lyrically and emotionally, but through the sound of the music I listen to with friends when we go out or when I’m on the treadmill or in my car,” he said. “I got excited because I thought my gay brothers and sisters would identify with this music more than what I’ve done in the past. It’s a sound that feels more like our scene.”Lambert is also aware of how much the music industry’s stance on openly LGBT performers has shifted in the time since he first emerged on the scene. In 2012, he made headlines as the first openly gay male artist to top the Billboard album chart, but just three years later, out stars like Sam Smith and Frank Ocean have their own record-breaking success stories. He hopes to find time to attend a few Pride celebrations this year, noting, that it’s “definitely something I want to be a part of.”“Ultimately, connecting with the community means a lot to me,” he said. “It’s been important to me.”Head here to check out Queerty’s full interview with Adam Lambert."

The kind of woman who reminds you of an elegance that has been lost in modern society but a kindness and intelligence that is very much present. I have known Yanna for years and witnessed her navigate the sophisticated politics of international crowds in multiple languages without losing the everyday realness that would inspire her to hold an in depth conversation with someone who might be working at one of the many social events her busy schedule allows. Her audience has included Liza Minnelli, John Guare, Arlene Dahl, authors such as Dominick Dunne and legendary socialites such as Daisy Soros, Pat Buckley, Ivana Trump, Nan Kempner, Taki Theorocopulos, Carolyne Roehm and legendary record executive Clive Davis. Or you may find politicos such as Vernon Jordan or fashion royalty's Mary McFadden, Carolina & Reinaldo Herrera and actual royalty Princess Firyal of Jordan. It is only fitting that this Renaissance Lady would title her latest cabaret show at 54 Below ""Make Some Magic."" I sat down with ""La Chantouze"" to find out a little more about what drives her in this mission to entertain, inspire and bewitch...EP -- First let me start by asking about training and development. How did you begin this journey and what have been your influences?YA -- I started my artistic endeavor as an actress; I studied at the National Conservatory of Dramatic Arts in Paris. Do not laugh, with a minor in Jean Racine Berenice tragedy! From that moment, my stage career began: First the classics (Moliere, Shakespeare, etc) in various productions, then ""Boeing-Boeing"" by Marc Camoletti in which I played ""Janet"" the American stewardess. In 1991, the play was listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the most performed French play throughout the world. The Broadway production included Gina Gershon in said part. Following this success, I got the part of the young American starlet in John Guare's ""House of Blue Leaves"" or in French ""Le Pape, New York"". Mr. Guare came to my last performance of ""Make Some Magic"" in April and that was magic! He had not seen me on stage since I was his young ingenue in Paris.  Yanna Avis and John GuareMy influences? All the Hollywood golden age movies currently referenced by Lana Del Rey and the others. Of course, the goddess La Dietrich!EP -- I am a big fan of Julie London and cannot help but see parallels of an artist who has been able to maintain a feminine profile but exude a strength in her determination to create. How has being an attractive person either helped or hurt your craft?YA -- I cannot resist quoting Marilyn Monroe's famous line in ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes""...""You men are funny; you don't marry a girl because she is pretty, but doesn't it help?""EP -- Who is your audience and how do you see yourself growing to broaden this base?YA -- When I began it was mostly my friends; then they brought their friends and my audience grew. That is where the challenge lies, introducing strangers to know me and luring them into my shows...the best reward!EP -- Why is it important to you that a new audience become fans of your style of entertainment?YA -- Unfortunately, Cabaret is not ""ala mode"" anymore. It belongs to an era when people loved glamour and would go for a night cap to listen to music. But don't forget the Avis motto: ""We Try Harder"" and I shall. Cabaret is a true passion for the actress I was born to be. EP -- When you are in front of an audience do you ever experience stage fright or have moments of insecurity?YA -- Oh, do I ever! This will never change but at the same time it makes your adrenaline rise and this gives you tremendous energy. EP -- You previously stated that your show continues to develop and grow. How so?YA -- Is it not that the more you do something you love, the better you become? There is so much to explore in great lyrics. EP -- I have always thought your shows were the perfect evening of entertainment; I have brought work colleagues, dates and family. Can you explain a little of how you plan a show?YA -- I am an entertainer and the best way to explain it would be the lines I wrote for one of my albums: L'amour, toujours L'amour...""It seems like a long way from the theatre stage of Paris to the cabaret scene of New York and yet...it came along as the most natural road for me to take and an inevitable challenge. I feel cabaret is a form of theatre with music. The songs I choose are like little plays about love, tenderness, despair and rapture. Strangers crowded together in the dark...I look into their eyes, I caress their hearts with love words and at times, I touch souls. No matter where, no matter when and no matter what the language the feeling is always the same. So here's to love, here's to the moment, here's to all the foolish hearts...like mine.""EP -- For readers that are unfamiliar with your work; where do they go to find out more about you and what homework should they do before attending your show? YA -- No homework please, except perhaps a quick French lesson. I have a website yannaavis.com as well as a professional FB and twitter. EP -- You consider yourself a cabaret performer. In your opinion, what is the current state of cabaret and where does this genre fit into today's prepackaged mega concerts? YA -- It could very well be just my illusion to believe the genre still fits into the 21st century...EP -- On a personal note, who are your heroes in entertainment past or present and how do you relate?YA -- If I answer this question, I will sound like an old movie since I am a hopeless romantic!EP -- Lastly, what does the future hold for Yanna? Give us a peak into your crystal ball...YA -- If you have one, cheri, please tell me!!!!EP -- Absolument!!!Yanna performs ""Make Some Magic"" Thursday, June 18th at 9:30PM at 54 Below"

Israel sent some 250 soldiers to Nepal to help search for casualties and build a field hospital following the 7.8-magnitude earthquake.

Their findings were based on three decades of typhoon data and government health and expenditure surveys.Families particularly cut spending on medicines, education and high nutrient foods such as meat, dairy, eggs and fruit, the researchers wrote in their working paper published online in 2013.The average number of reported deaths per year in the typhoons analyzed from 1979 to 2008 was about 740.But the researchers found approximately 11,300 babies died before their first birthday because family finances were crippled in the aftermath of typhoons in the previous one to two years.All the babies were girls according to their analysis of the government data.Jesse Anttila-Hughes, a professor of economics at the University of San Francisco and one of the authors of the study, said he was surprised that only baby girls were affected.He said it could be linked to breastfeeding practices after a typhoon or possibly parents' belief that girls are more resilient.He added that the post-typhoon infant mortality effect was ""very strong"" and is likely to occur in more recent disasters, such as Typhoon Haiyan which killed 6,000 people in the Philippines in 2013.""It's highly likely that it would hold in Typhoon Haiyan. It's the same context, the same phenomenon ...

8,GREEN,How She Does It: The Making of Sophie Gamand's Flower Power Series,"This Dog's Life, ContributorDiscovery website for dog owners and lovers",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/how-she-does-it-the-making-of-sophie-gamands-flower-power-series_b_7566442.html,Hundreds upon hundreds of synthetic flower petal crowns travel with Gamand on her shelter trips to ensure she finds the right look for each dog.,2015-06-12,2015-07-01-1435754512-6307902-ScreenShot20150701at8.40.09AM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-07-01-1435754512-6307902-ScreenShot20150701at8.40.09AM.png,"Of the approximate 3.9 million dogs that enter the shelter system, about 1.4 million, or 1 in 3, make it out. The statistic for pit bulls is not as optimistic with some findings stating only 1 in 600 will be adopted, with the rest being euthanized.An award-winning photographer has made it her mission to change these stats. Last year, French-born Sophie Gamand began a project to change the perception of pit bulls, a breed that is often deemed dangerous, violent and aggressive. Calling it Flower Power: Pit Bulls of the Revolution, New York City-based Gamand created the series to show pit bulls in a softer light -- portraying them to look like ""hippies, soft fairy-tale-inspired characters, feminine and dreamy."" To achieve this, she places homemade floral crowns on shelter pit bulls and poses them against pastel backgrounds in hopes viewers see the breed's true beauty, not the negative stereotypes often associated with them.To date Gamand has volunteered hundreds of hours to photograph approximately 120 pit bulls from New York City shelters including Sean Casey Animal Rescue, Second Chance Rescue, Animal Haven, Brookhaven Animal Shelter and Hempstead Town Animal Shelter.Her passion project seems to be paying off. Approximately half the pit bulls have been adopted, a rate much higher than the above mentioned national average. She has also helped shine a light on the bigger problem of prejudice against pit bulls, as her series has made its way onto hundreds of online media publications, while also capturing the attention of big-name outlets including BuzzFeed, Huffington Post and Oprah Magazine.""After the first images received such a positive reaction from people and went viral online, I realized I had developed a wonderful marketing tool for pit bulls and maybe this series could help make a difference,"" says Gamand.She is now considering going beyond New York and traveling across the country to visit shelters and gather more stories.And while the dogs play a major role in the series, Gamand also deserves credit for creating such beautiful images.When Gamand recently visited the Hempstead Town shelter to photograph pit bulls, including a red one named Apple, we went behind the scenes to see how she works her magic.It all begins with a suitcase. Hundreds upon hundreds of synthetic flower petal crowns travel with Gamand on her shelter trips to ensure she finds the right look for each dog. ""I want to make sure every crown is different; I look for inspiration in the flowers, she says.Each crown takes between 30 minutes and an hour to make but that doesn't necessarily mean they will be used. ""If I don't like them, I don't use them.""Setting the stage for the impromptu photo studio While the end shot is stunning, the actual setting is a no frills, bare bones environment. Almost all the shoots happen at the shelter and Gamand needs to make the most of her tight quarters. To do so, she sets up a backdrop (any color will do), lighting and other photography equipment to help set the scene.Having her trusty camera is key Every photographer has a favorite camera and for Gamand it is a Nikon. ""My camera is like my baby!""Choosing the guest of honors ""These shelter dogs go through so much and their daily life is not always fun,"" Gamand says. ""The photo shoots are breaking their routine, and they are stimulating.""Ensuring the crowns fit like a glove Not all crowns work for all dogs and some pups can be trickier than others.   ""Each dog has a different shape of face,"" she says. ""Pit bulls have often have big cheekbones so sometimes I struggle to find a crown that will fit nicely.""She not only looks for flower crowns that fit in terms of size but also shape, color and mood. ""A lot goes into choosing the perfect crown for each dog.""Snapping away ""I love when a dog understands what we want and does it, then gets all excited when they get the reward for it. They are so proud. It's beautiful.""Finally, the real magic is revealed. Once the shoot is complete, Gamand heads back to her home and digitally paints on the image. And voila another Flower Power image is born - and hopefully another overlooked dog gets adopted.""They [the images] have gone places and every day people express how touched they are. To me that's where the magic is,"" says Gamand. ""Not how I made them but how they are bringing everyone together. These are not just dogs wearing flower crowns; something much bigger is happening, slowly. But hopefully, surely!""If you want to learn more Gamand and her work, check out the prints she has available on Striking Paws. You can also keep tabs on what she is working on next (her Wet Dog book is coming out soon) by following her on social media channels including Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, where she has 43,000 fans and counting.All images taken by Colby BlountThis article originally appeared on This Dog's Life, a discovery platform highlighting amazing brands while providing dog lovers original, local and national content along with curated stories from across the web.

It is simply an enormously complex and complicated set of global trade policies that rightfully deserve careful discussion and thoughtful debate.,2015-06-12,"FILE - In this Sept. 18, 2013 file photo, President Barack Obama speaks to members of the Business Roundtable, a trade group representing Americaâs big business, in Washington. President Barack Obama is working to put two major emerging trade deals with Europe and Asia on a âfast trackâ to passage. But many congressional Democrats are working to sidetrack the proposed pacts ahead of this yearâs U.S. midterm elections. The Democratic president finds himself in the rare position of having House Speaker John Boehner as an ally on the issue and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid as a foe. (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais, File)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ffe224000031009901a8.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"If the current debate on global trade is bipartisanship, maybe paralysis is preferable after all. As votes on the Trans Pacific Partnership, Trade Promotion Authority (better known as Fast Track), and Trade Adjustment Assistance looms in the House of Representatives there is little doubt that the average American voter is so confused at this point that public sentiment is not a factor. This is accentuated by the fact that the American public has very little idea what has been negotiated by the nearly 600 corporate lobbyists who have over many years crafted positions on 29 chapters, of which only five deal with trade, into a document that will strengthen the power of multi-national corporations over sovereign governments and affect 40 percent of the world economy.Confused yet? Well throw this in for good measure, your elected representatives in Congress have only recently been allowed to take a peek at negotiated drafts under secrecy that would find comfort in a James Bond 007 thriller. They are allowed to peek but not take notes, cannot make copies, are not afforded the luxury of having professional staff accompany them, and are sworn to not share what they have seen with mere mortals such as the people they represent. Are you still with me?Now, as if this is not reason enough for you or your Congressman to seriously question whether everything is, excuse the term kosher here, there is some information that is available regarding the substance of the agreement that has been provided by Wikileaks which might raise the eyebrows considerably. For instance, there is a process embodied in the negotiated drafts which essentially allows corporations, let's say for instance Chevron or Exxon Mobil, you know some of the richest corporations in the history of mankind, to seek to overturn the actions of sovereign governments with respect to environmental protection because they could affect ""anticipated"" not actual profits. And the remedies in the form of compensation would be meted out by a tribunal of corporate tax lawyers. Ummmm, you say, that can't be right? Yep, it is. It is called Investor-State Dispute Resolution. Process is important and oftentimes is more determinative of consequences than product. In this instance we have a process that is atrocious and a product that is largely unknown, that in and of itself portends a dangerously volatile mix of potions that neither seems free nor fair. Labor unions are vehemently opposed to lack of enforceable labor protections, health advocates are deeply worried about negative consequences for access to generic medicines for poor people, anti-tobacco groups are concerned that governments wishing to stem tobacco use will be forced to spend precious financial resources defending against the deep pockets of large multinational corporations like Phillip Morris, and food safety advocates fear that harmonizing agricultural standards will create a race to the lowest common denominator, hence reduced food safety.This is and should not be presented as a vote for or against the president. It is simply an enormously complex and complicated set of global trade policies that rightfully deserve careful discussion and thoughtful debate. Fast-tracking, a maneuver that allows for only an up or down vote on the entire package may be an expedient way of ramming this package through the legislative process but it sacrifices the carefully crafted constitutional processes so essential to our governmental framework and ought to concern those on the left and the right. Politics does make for strange bedfellows sometimes and this is one of the strangest I have witnessed in my nearly four decades in the business. I don't know which is more disconcerting, that the President is relying on Republican leadership to get this through the House or that self-proclaimed Socialists are shoulder to shoulder with Tea Party stalwarts in opposition. Regardless, you do not have to be a rocket scientist to understand that there is something inherently wrong with the process and the product. And when you go to such great lengths to inhibit transparency there is a high probability that the result will be bad. If it can't withstand scrutiny it is probably not worth the effort."

A festival for every flavor of filmmaking from features, shorts, animation, horror, women, wildlife, documentaries and even for films featuring moustaches. Each one's vying for eyeballs. There are just a handful of fests that are considered important. The top tier fests, Venice, Cannes, Toronto, Sundance and Berlin attract audiences, media and distributors who come mainly for the narrative fiction films and celebrities. The increasing importance of documentaries has given rise to a selection of fests focused specifically on non-fiction films. One of the best, AFI Docs, put on annually by the American Film Institute in and around Washington, D.C., opens next week, June 17 and runs through the 21st.I spoke with the festival's new director, Michael Lumpkin about what sets AFI Docs apart and why people should go to festivals when they can sit home and watch TV. Here's an edited portion of our conversation.Q: Why a festival in Washington, D.C.?Lumpkin: It's about great documentary filmmakers and about geography. This region has the most highly educated population in the country and they have a keen interest in film. That's a documentary audience.Q: What else about D.C.? Does being in the Nation's capitol influence the film selection?Lumpkin: We purposely connect issues and politics that are going on in legislation and policy. We connect films and filmmakers to people who are working on these issues. We have really informed conversations after the screenings at the festival.Q. How do you do you connect filmmakers to this ecosystem?Lumpkin: This year we have an experiment, an impact lab, where we'll plug films and filmmakers into conversations with policymakers to talk about how to make sure their films have impact. Two days before the festival they'll meet legislators, strategists and others and discuss how to create awareness around important issues. They'll also meet with donors and talk about funding strategies.  Q. I noticed a lot of the documentaries are produced, directed, edited or scored by women. More than we'll find in the narrative fiction world. Almost 50% of the films shown at the recent Sheffield Documentary Festival were by women? Are women more represented in documentaries than in fiction?Lumpkin: The data support that. A much higher percentage of women work in documentaries. This year over 40% (48%) of the films we're screening are by women. There's still a lot of work to be done. There's still a glass ceiling.Q. What can we expect to see this year?Lumpkin: In the films you'll meet extraordinary people. Great biographies. Some famous like Steve Jobs, LA Food critic Jonathan Gold, singers Nina Simone and Mavis Staples. And others like those who live in a Syrian refugee camp in Jordan.  Q. What connects these films? Do they all open a window on a seldom seen world? Lumpkin: You hear about the refugee problem in the media but you get to learn things in a long form documentary you can't in a 30-second news story. You connect with people in a situation and understand it in ways you wouldn't otherwise.Q. What convinced you to take this job?Lumpkin: What drew me was the potential of the festival, what can happen when we bring people together to experience documentaries in a unique way. It's that hot and muggy time of the year in D.C. but the venues are all air-conditioned. So do yourself a favor and take in some of these exceptional films.These are my recommendations and a link to order tickets. Most films screen more than one time and at different venues. Many screen in the evening so you can actually do your time in the cubicle during the day. In addition to these, try and make the time to see some of the shorts and some of the other films. Many of these you won't see on PBS, HBO or Netflix. This is your chance. If necessary, call in sick and go. You'll be glad you did.To order tickets:Wednesday June 17Opening night gala; Magnolia Pictures' BEST OF ENEMIES, from director Robert Gordon and Academy Award®-winning director Morgan Neville (20 FEET FROM STARDOM), as the Opening Night film at AFI DOCS.

And when people graduate college, they tend to have certain expectations. Finding a good job, for one thing. And why shouldn't they? After all, they've just spent several years, and a lot of money, preparing for their career. But the reality is that many graduates don't end up working in the industry or field they studied. Some can't find a job at all. The cycle has become all too typical: university -- graduation -- a disappointing job or no job -- disillusionment and, for some, disengagement. A conference I attended last fall aptly described the 'glass door phenomenon': grads can see the opportunity through the door, but just can't navigate their way to it. One part of the problem is the expectation gap: the distance between the skills and experience that young people have, and the skills that employers are looking for and, indeed, expect graduates to have. A new study from the Association of American Colleges and Universities (AACU) highlights this gap. When college students and employers of recent graduates were asked similar questions about job-readiness and workplace skills, their responses showed a huge difference of opinion. Across the board, students considered themselves much better prepared for the workplace than employers did. In critical areas such as communication, problem-solving, teamwork, and applying knowledge to real world situations, nearly two-thirds of students felt well prepared. But fewer than three out of 10 employers gave recent graduate hires high marks in these areas.  So, college students may have unrealistic expectations about how well their education is preparing them for the real world. Clearly, classroom knowledge isn't the same as learning by doing. But how can young people have a strong set of practical workplace skills if they have never applied their knowledge in a real workplace? College graduates are not the only ones running into the glass door. The problem of youth unemployment is one of the biggest challenges we face today. Globally, 73 million young people are neither employed nor in school. In the U.S. alone, 17 percent of the nation's youth are unemployed.And for many, the barrier to employment isn't just a lack of 'soft skills.' It's a lack of resources. Even though college is touted as a sure-fire way up the economic ladder, the majority of students from low-income families who start college don't graduate. Last month, the Pell Institute and the University of Pennsylvania's Alliance for Higher Education released a study showing a huge disparity in college completion rates between rich and poor students. While 77 percent of youth from families in the top quarter income bracket obtained bachelor's degrees by age 24 in 2013, only 9 percent of those from the lowest income bracket did. The problem is two-fold: inadequate financial resources as well as, in many cases, inadequate academic preparation in high school. Lower income youth are hitting the glass door due to a lack of resources, while those from higher income brackets are obtaining degrees, and yet still don't have the skills employers need. Meanwhile, many industries are facing skills shortages. It's a problem that demands creative solutions, not just from policy makers and educators, but employers as well. The good news is, we can do something about it. What can employers do to manage the expectation gap? 1. TrainNo new hire is really 'job-ready'. At the very least, they need to learn the culture of the organization and how they are expected to fit into it. Employers can clarify expectations from day one by assimilating new hires with in-house training. Successful training programs include benchmarks to measure progress and corresponding wage progression. Providing clear pathways for people to gain new skills and be rewarded for good work is an invaluable tool in bridging the gap. 2. Mentor  Mentoring is a proven method of training that can be applied on a large scale or a small scale. As part of a training program, mentorship is an effective way to pass on organizational knowledge as well as job-specific skills. It's been shown to have a positive impact on those who mentor as well as those who are mentored. The climate of guidance and support that mentorship creates boosts engagement and professional development throughout an organization. Mentoring is valuable on the small scale as well. People who have life and workplace experience can connect with people caught in the expectation gap by offering advice and steering them in the right direction. 3. CollaborateEngage in partnerships with educators, beginning at secondary school level. Many young people caught in the expectation gap have never had the opportunity to learn by doing, for which there is no substitute. The development of critical thinking, problem-solving, communication and teamwork skills -- which are so vital to success in any field -- does not happen on paper. Whether large corporations or small businesses, employers benefit from collaborating with educators. The more young people have the chance to learn in a professional environment, mentored by established professionals, the more prepared, engaged and motivated they are when entering the workforce. These kinds of partnerships ease the school to work transition, making it far less intimidating and more easily navigated -- with fewer chances for getting lost in the gap."

Providing clear pathways for people to gain new skills and be rewarded for good work is an invaluable tool in bridging the gap. 2. Mentor  Mentoring is a proven method of training that can be applied on a large scale or a small scale. As part of a training program, mentorship is an effective way to pass on organizational knowledge as well as job-specific skills. It's been shown to have a positive impact on those who mentor as well as those who are mentored. The climate of guidance and support that mentorship creates boosts engagement and professional development throughout an organization. Mentoring is valuable on the small scale as well. People who have life and workplace experience can connect with people caught in the expectation gap by offering advice and steering them in the right direction. 3. CollaborateEngage in partnerships with educators, beginning at secondary school level. Many young people caught in the expectation gap have never had the opportunity to learn by doing, for which there is no substitute. The development of critical thinking, problem-solving, communication and teamwork skills -- which are so vital to success in any field -- does not happen on paper. Whether large corporations or small businesses, employers benefit from collaborating with educators. The more young people have the chance to learn in a professional environment, mentored by established professionals, the more prepared, engaged and motivated they are when entering the workforce. These kinds of partnerships ease the school to work transition, making it far less intimidating and more easily navigated -- with fewer chances for getting lost in the gap."

How can fasting help focus attention on what matters? What are those who observe the fast hoping to learn? These are the questions of the Holy Month of Ramadan. Welcome to this week's All Together, the podcast dedicated to exploring ethics, religion and spiritual practice. Please download All Together on  iTunes, or Stitcher.This week, I speak with Imam Khalid Latif, a University Chaplain at New York University, and the Executive Director of the NYU Islamic Center. In 2007, he became the youngest chaplain to serve the New York City Police Department. Recently Chelsea Clinton produced a documentary on Imam Latif's relationship with NYU's Jewish Chaplain, Rabbi Yeduda Sarna, called Of Many"" On a personal note, I was honored to work with Imam Latif at Princeton University when I was the Associate Dean for Religious Life and we appointed him to be the first Muslim Chaplain. For the past four years, Imam Latif has written a meditation each day during Ramadan for The Huffington Post. His reflections have delved into subjects as diverse as gender, prayer, war, death, his mother and social justice. These pieces were shared and discussed by Muslims around the world. Today, Imam Latif speaks to to us about the deep spiritual meaning of Ramadan. I promise you, this is not just for Muslims but for all those who wrestle with the two questions at the center of Latif's work: ""What are your values, and how do take care of your heart?""Also on this program, you will hear a reflection from Jamila Afghani, the founder and director of an NGO serving women, youth and children in Afghanistan. Like Imam Latif, Jamila reminds us that Ramadan is primarily about gaining spiritual strength and about the Jihad, or struggle of the soul.

""I want someone to be a Laura Benanti drag queen,"" Benanti told The Huffington Post on June 4. As it turns out, the characters she's played provide ample opportunity for a gender-bending homage: ""Either Gypsy Rose Lee in 'Gypsy,' or Elsa [from 'The Sound of Music Live!'] and that amazing pantsuit, or even Candela in 'Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown' -- that was a great costume. I'm putting it out there now -- I need it. And if not now, when?""Gay theatergoers have always responded to Benanti's sassy, irreverent sense of humor, which she's played to great effect on social media and in a series of viral videos, so it's surprising a drag homage has yet to materialize. And don't forget the #GaysForElsa Twitter sensation she ignited in late 2013 after stealing the show from Carrie Underwood in ""The Sound of Music Live!,"" which was an NBC ratings smash. Even though Benanti has literary, television and Broadway projects in the works, she's thrilled to make time to hit the stage with the Boston Gay Men's Chorus for a one-night-only performance. The show, which hits Boston's Symphony Hall on June 14, will feature music from Benanti's best-known Broadway roles as well as some tunes that appeared on her 2013 live album, ""In Constant Search of the Right Kind of Attention."" It's very much a personal passion project for the ""Nashville"" and ""Good Wife"" alum, and her commitment to the performance runs deep. Her uncle, the late Robert Wonneberger, was a founding member of the Gay Men's Chorus of Washington, D.C. She performed with that chorus during Wonneberger's lifetime, and has since gone on to sing with the San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus, too. ""In a way, I feel like I'm continuing his legacy in being part of something so wonderful,"" she said. ""I know that these choruses become family for a lot of these men, some of whom are rejected by their [biological] family. For me, performing with them is really, really important."" The fact that her Boston performance coincides with LGBT Pride Month hasn't gone unnoticed by the star, who will next be seen on the hotly-anticipated CBS pilot, ""Supergirl,"" and will return to Broadway in 2016 opposite Josh Radnor in ""She Loves Me."" ""Pride, to me, means a group of people who, in the past, have not been given their rights, but are now able to celebrate how far they've come, and look forward to where they really should be,"" she said. Laura Benanti performs with the Boston Gay Men's Chorus on June 14. Head here for more details. "

About 27 percent of these loans are in default for people between 65 and 74 and more than half of these loans are in default for people 75 and over. All in, about three percent of households headed by someone over 65 holds student debt.The federal government can seize up to 15 percent of the Social Security check of retirees in default to pay back student loans. Since most older adults rely on Social Security benefits for half or more of their income, that's a hefty chunk of money. And, often the lowest paid workers claim Social Security benefits at 62, reducing their benefits by 25 percent. More than 700,000 U.S. households headed by people 65 and older are living with student debt. According to a 2014 report from the Government Accountability Office, these older Americans still owe more than $18 billion in student loans. Many policymakers now agree that we need to expand Social Security benefits and former Labor Secretary Robert Reich has a short video explaining why we can afford to do so.The government has the right to go after student loans that are in default while you are working, but that requires the government to sue and get a court order. It's far easier for the government to seize Social Security benefits directly. Under the law, the government can either attach funds or seize Social Security funds that have been in the bank for more than two months.Of note, the number of Americans 50 and older with student loan debt has grown significantly in the 21 century, from 3 million in 2005 to 6.9 million in 2012. Benefits were offset for about 36,000 retirees over 65 in 2013, six times as many as in 2002. And the amount of debt grew more than six-fold between 2005 and 2013, to $18.2 billion. More than 80 percent of the debt was for people's own education, and about 18 percent for a child or grandchild.If you're not sure whether you still owe money on a student loan, call the U.S. Department of the Treasury's Bureau of the Fiscal Service (800 304-3107) If you owe money, you might want to contact your local legal aid office to see if staff can help you work out a viable loan repayment plan.

The new Ukraine is still alive and determined to defend itself. Though Ukraine, on its own, is no match for Russia's military might, its allies could decide to do 'whatever it takes' to help, short of becoming involved in a direct military confrontation with Russia or violating the Minsk agreement. Doing so would not only help Ukraine; it would also help the EU to recapture the values and principles that it seems to have lost. Needless to say, this is the scenario I advocate.""These statements were published about two months ago on the respected financial website marketwatch.com. They were written by the world's prominent citizen, George Soros. Soros needs no introduction. I'm sure most readers are aware of both him and his background. What spurred my comment is the ease with which someone, regardless of his global power and influence, can express such views. Let's cut to the chase. What this gentleman proposes as the most hopeful scenario of the ones he outlines is an allied--presumably he means involving the major European players and, obviously, the U.S.--military intervention in Ukraine to stem Russian expansionism. In my humble opinion, it's both inconceivable and terrifying that such a powerful man would propose an action that could spark a new world war. I'm not in a position to take on someone and confront him with enough arguments, someone whose decisions affect the lives of millions of people around the world. A man who is obviously an ""insider"", someone who has access to more information than we do. Nor could I adequately analyze the Ukraine issue to argue one side or the other. My concern can be seen in the timing of my comments about his statements, two months after their publication. I'm not interested in breaking news. My interest lies in analyzing behavior outside the confines of time. And what made Soros's statements stick in my mind was the article's headline: ""Europe ditches Ukraine as it seeks to save Greece."" In Soros's article, we see a powerful businessman, a man listed among the globe's thirty wealthiest men, state that the attention of the leaders of the Western world shouldn't be on saving a population that is suffering and crumpling because of the dysfunctional financial system, but, on the contrary, should focus on organizing a military action against a superpower. A military action whose devastating consequences would include loss of human life, destruction of generations and societies, and much more. When I read such views being expressed by such powerful people who are obviously more in turn with numbers than with human life and human values, I dub the phenomenon ""The Birth of Wars"". Just like the article's title."

We only reveal God and the Torah by choosing to live as one man and one heart.",2015-06-12,2015-05-02-1430589390-3331005-huffpostjesseaaron.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-05-02-1430589390-3331005-huffpostjesseaaron-thumb.JPG,"Jesse Bogner and Aaron Chester, IsraelThis is a written exchange with my friend Aaron Chester. We are both Americans living in Israel. Our goal was to dissect the recent boycotts of Israel and the general lack of support for Israel internationally and come to meaningful solutions. Jesse: Israel has gone from a nation that was almost universally seen as a bastion of peace and a story of triumph to the sole nation being blamed in the train wreck that is the Middle East. The recent boycotts and threats of boycotts of Israel products are part of a string of anti-Israel propaganda that has been developing for about a decade. The BDS movement has consistently been trying to marginalize Israel's right to exist under the guise of protesting Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories. They do this by forcibly using their wide support net of both Muslims and liberals of all faiths, colors and creeds to pressure companies to boycott Israel for its occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. This wide net of people as of late has included many Jews who would never openly call for the destruction of Israel, but feel a moral ambivalence towards the nation. Public opinion has made it not only fashionable to support boycotts of Israel, but liberal, normally right-minded people feel a moral obligation to put the disclaimer, ""I don't support the occupation of the West Bank,"" to any positive musing about Israel. As someone living in Israel, I have to ask myself what is Israel doing wrong? This is because in my understanding of the situation I never thought Israel was wrong to defend itself. Some have argued Israel merely has a marketing problem and in all fairness Israelis in the media do not do themselves any favors. Unlike BDS and Hamas for that matter, Israel does not have a unified message that the public can cling onto. It certainly doesn't help when one of Israel's most respected journalists is saying in Haaretz that the boycotts are a light punishment for occupation and that the Hadash party is signing off on the boycott. However, I have mixed feelings about taking these people to task, because the fact that free speech, however deplorable is tolerated is one of the unique features of Israel in the region. This free speech does create a problem with public perception. If Israelis are symbolically in favor of Israel making itself vulnerable above securing itself from the wrath of terrorism and its enemies on all sides, what are American liberals supposed to think? If Israel is in the wrong it certainly makes sense for Orange to get out of its contract with Israel when it feels a clear financial benefit. Even the FIFA fiasco makes sense if Israel if public perception is that Israel is a racist Imperial power that unnecessarily kills Palestinian children. The argument is extremely skewed when people forget that a decade ago suicide bombers were killing Israelis an average of 2-3 times a week. I don't understand how this is lost in the argument. Just as I don't understand how people ignore that Israel was founded because most of the European Jews had been murdered in the Holocaust and the recent rise of anti-Semitism there clearly shows how unwanted the Jews are even today.Aaron: And that's the whole point. The current boycotts and the anti-Israel movement in general is really not a rational one at all. On the normal political and socio-economic spectrum it makes no sense at all that so much of the world feels negatively towards us. The boycotts and threats of FIFA, or Orange, or any other business, only show an escalation of a growing consensus that Israel is harming the world. And this escalation is a small one if we really think hard as to what could come next. The issue in fact is not political, or reasonable in any way, and that's why we need to go much deeper to get to the root of it. You mentioned the Holocaust and its direct relationship with the existence of the state of Israel and how the world as a whole has as if forgotten this terrible atrocity. Its a real wonder, but then again it's a real wonder as to how this unimaginable horror happened to begin with and it is also quite unreal that the Jewish people, who had no interest in returning to what was at the time a desolate swampland, somehow ended up back in this tiny country smack dab in the Middle East. You would think we would be the good guys and underdogs in the eyes of the world, and that they would be praising the amazing progress we have made as a people after damn near complete annihilation, but we see this is not the case at all. Maybe there was a brief time when we returned to this land that the world saw us differently, but in general, we as Jews have never been viewed under the positive lens of the world that we are wishing for. The nations of the world may think they are angry with us because of the Israel-Palestinian conflict, but this is not the case. As problems increase within every country's own borders be it the U.S., or France, or anywhere else in the world, for some odd reason the focus on this tiny Jewish land in a sea of Arab Nations only becomes greater and greater. Today it is threats of cutting off business or sports ties, and tomorrow, who knows what. Today the reason is Palestinian occupation, and tomorrow who knows. The nations themselves are not to blame for their attitude to Israel, and they do not know why they are so preoccupied with this tiny dot on the map. Israelis also do not know why, and our boasting of our achievements and the Arabs' lack thereof do nothing for us but cause more damage. But there are those who understand the whole picture very well, and they happen to be the very people that formed and maintained the nation of Israel for thousands of years. We survived many hardships far more difficult than boycotts, but we have forgotten how and for what reason they came to us.The answer is quite simple. The nation of Israel is responsible for the happiness and well being of the entire world. We hold in our hands the means to connect all of humanity, every nation and people, as a single harmonious family. Simply put, we are responsible for teaching the whole world how to ""love thy neighbor as thyself."" We as Jews and Israelis have forgotten it, and the entire world is actually not aware of it, but they so subconsciously feel that we are thorn that keeps digging deeper and deeper into this world. Jesse: I feel like I might be boring the people who read all my articles, but there is a single solution to correct all these problems. Not only anti-Semitism, but hatred generally. Unfortunately most people don't care to listen, but I feel compelled to shout it from the rooftops. I don't desire to blame anyone. All I want is for the world to understand that the force that prevents Israel and Palestine from connecting is the same ego that prevents neighbors and families for living peaceful happy lives. We need to invert our own desire into a desire to love others, feel their needs and care for them as we would ourselves. Whether you agree with this or not, you may feel incapable of achieving such a state. This is because our nature is to receive, to feel good. However we find especially in Israel that self-seeking only creates misery. This is because Israel has a specific role it is not fulfilling. Israel is not really a nation (we don't share geographical or racial commonality), but an ideological state that our ancestors agreed to. We only reveal God and the Torah by choosing to live as one man and one heart. If all the people of Israel demanded this state of our ancestors, these boycotts wouldn't be happening. These boycotts, rockets, and the rise of anti-Semitism are inevitable when Israel doesn't make the conscious choice to work above our nature to fulfill ourselves as individuals. Only with a force of love and unification will the irrational hatred of Israel disappear. All we need to do is connect with each other one person at a time until this reality will reveal itself. If we do not, eventually we will see we don't have any other choice."

PHOTO BY CHELSEA KYLE, FOOD STYLING BY ANNA STOCKWELL""YES, ROSÉ IS A LIFESTYLE"" Rosé isn't just a beverage--it's lifestyle.At least that's the idea behind Yes Way Rosé, the Instagram account turned full-fledged, pink-tinted lifestyle brand. Started as a joke between friends Erica Blumenthal and Nikki Huganir, Yes Way personifies what it means to be a die-hard rosé drinker. ""Rosé is dry, lighthearted, and refreshing,"" explains Blumenthal. ""You're never stressed out when you're drinking rosé.""The Instagram account functions as a representation of that idea--rosé by the beach, rosé in the vineyards, rosé on a rooftop. So get on the rosé train.""WHAT IS THIS 'ROSÉ SEASON' YOU SPEAK OF?"" Summer is hailed as the start of ""rosé season,"" the-five-or-so-months-a-year that's generally accepted as the time to drink rosé. So, perfect, get your pink drink on until October. But don't stop there. Blumenthal and Huganir aren't firmly in the anti-rosé season camp and argue that the beverage should be consumed all year round, mostly because rosé isn't as limiting as people seem to think it is (more on that in a second).""GUYS, THERE ARE SO MANY DIFFERENT STYLES OF ROSÉ"" If you think of rosé as summer water--that dangerously drinkable beverage you don't have to think twice about--you're not alone. But one of the first steps to truly embracing the stuff is to expand your mind. Sure, rosé can be simple and fun, but it can also be so much more (note: it's always fun).Fruity: Look to rosé made from grenache, sangiovese, or pinot noir grapes for bottles with a fruity bent. Region-wise, you'll be extremely happy with the wines of Provence, the mecca of all rosé. Note that fruity doesn't necessarily mean sweet--many rosés from Provence are bone dry and high in acid. Basically, your ideal day drinking and brunch eating wine.Sweet: This is what most people think of when they think of rosé. A good chunk of this category is made from Zinfandel grapes, which lend the wine it's off-dry (that's winespeak for slightly-sweet) taste and can bring with it flavors of berries, citrus, and melon.Floral: The South of France produces wines made from Mourvèdre--they're the perfect balance of fruit and dried herbal notes. You can spot them by their pale pink color.Savory: Would you believe us if we told you that you could serve rosé with red meat? Grab a bottle from Côtes du Rhône or an American bottle made from the Syrah grape--they'll sport a darker color and a much deeper, bolder flavor than any you've ever had.3 BOTTLES TO TRY We asked Blumenthal and Huganir to rattle off a few of their current favorites--though they're quick to point out that ""picking a favorite rosé is like a parent picking a favorite child."" Plus, they've got their very own limited-edition rosé bottle available right this very moment.Bridge Lane Rosé - $18 (Bottle) or $40 (3L Box) ""We love that there are incredible rosés being made right here in NY, and this one from Long Island is a great example. Primarily made of Cabernet Franc, Bridge Lane is light-bodied and dry with lots of red fruit flavors. The added bonus of buying from this vineyard is that they're all available in bottles, 3L boxes or 20L kegs!"" Note: The price works out to the equivalent of $10/bottle if you buy the box. Chateau Pigoudet Aix En Provence Rosé 2014 - $11 ""A quintessential example of the beautifully balanced and barely-there blush rosés from Provence, this wine is light, dry, refreshing, and highly instagrammable. This is the type of wine that made us love rosé in the first place."" Robert Sinskey Vin Gris of Pinot Noir 2014 - $28 ""One of our favorites from a recent trip to Napa Valley, this rosé is crisp, refreshing and bone dry with vibrant wild strawberry and peach flavors. Its super elegant light pink hue would easily elevate any summer dinner or barbecue."" Bonus Pick Summer Water - $18 ""We're not just saying this because we collaborated with Club W on this one, but Summer Water rosé is the best thing ever. A perfectly pale pink made with Napa Valley Pinot Noir grapes, it's dry with a juicy texture and light floral aromas. Maybe as easy to drink as ""regular"" water.""

Yet former governor Mike Huckabee, a favorite of Christian conservatives, took to mocking transgender people at the National Religious Broadcasters Convention as he criticized city ordinances that allow people to use public restrooms based on how they identify their gender.The website Buzzfeed unearthed a video of the February comments in which the former Baptist minister quipped, “Now I wish that someone told me that when I was in high school that I could have felt like a woman when it came time to take showers in PE. I’m pretty sure that I would have found my feminine side and said, ‘Coach, I think I’d rather shower with the girls today.’” As the presumably Christian audience clapped and giggled, Huckabee said, “You’re laughing because it sounds so ridiculous, doesn’t it?”Yes, it does. But not for the reason they think. What’s ridiculous — and sad — is that Huckabee, a candidate for the Republican presidential nomination, and his audience appear to believe that transgender people are perpetrating some sort of hoax so they can gain access to public restrooms or locker rooms. Or that they’ve chosen to identify with a particular gender on a whim. This disregards the actual lives of transgender people, some of whom (though not all) have described feeling trapped in the wrong body from a young age. What’s so funny about that?Worse, the butt of this joke are people who are already too frequently marginalized by society. According to the Human Rights Campaign, transgender people are nearly four times more likely to have an annual household income of less than $10,000 and twice as likely to be unemployed compared with the general population. The 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey found that “78 percent of those who expressed a transgender identity or gender non-conformity while in grades K-12 reported harassment — harassment so severe it led 15 percent to leave school.”The majority of the youth surveyed by HRC in 2014 reported they lacked a supportive family member to help them face the harassment and ostracizing at school.One twentysomething transgender person told Religion News Service columnist Jonathan Merritt in 2013, that his growing up in the church was damaging. He felt he couldn’t talk to his parents or his pastor. Instead, the then-she, prayed God would help her become a boy.Yet when Huckabee was asked about his cruel joke — a version of which he has told on a few occasions — he dismissed the query, saying, “Nobody ever asks me about it except the media. They’re the only ones who seem to be stirred up about it.” While attempting to indict journalists, Huckabee was in fact indicting those who surround him who he seems to be suggesting are indifferent to Christian unkindness toward transgender people.Though Huckabee might believe that being transgender is sinful, that’s not a uniform position. Pat Robertson acknowledged in 2013 that “I think there are men who are in a woman’s body. It’s very rare, but it’s true. Or women that are in men’s bodies.” Robertson added, “I don’t think there’s any sin associated with” transitioning to the other gender.The church should be the safest place in the world to discuss personal struggles. Huckabee could help make it so by saying two simple words: I’m sorry.(Kirsten Powers writes weekly for USA TODAY and is author of the upcoming “The Silencing: How the Left is Killing Free Speech.”)"

They include Dan Shefet, a French lawyer born in Denmark, who won a defamation case in French court recently that called for the global results to be scrubbed. Google has not complied.""In accordance with the (European court) judgment, the CNIL considers that in order to be effective, de-listing must be carried out on all extensions of the search engine and that the service provided by Google search constitutes a single processing,"" the CNIL regulator said.France is the first country to open a potential sanctions process against Google if it does not change its position on the scope of the de-listings. But the powers of the CNIL remain limited, since it can only impose fines of up to 150,000 euros.The Mountain View, California-based Google had annual revenue of $66 billion last year.Google was not immediately available for comment.

26,POLITICS,Alaska Budget Deal Averts Government Shutdown. Now Comes The Hard Part.,Daniel Marans,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/alaska-government-shutdown-oil_n_7566298.html,,2015-06-12,"Alaska Governor Bill Walker during a meeting of the National Governors Association at the White House in Washington, DC, February 23, 2015. AFP PHOTO/JIM WATSON (Photo credit should read JIM WATSON/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8ffe02400005000577e8c.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Alaska’s legislature approved a budget on Thursday that averts a government shutdown and ends a weeks-long political impasse. Now, talk turns to making state finances less dependent on the price of oil, including a once-unthinkable state income tax.According to the Alaska Dispatch News, the $5 billion state budget for fiscal 2016 includes $30 million in pay increases for state employees that had been a sticking point of negotiations between the state House and the state Senate. Republicans control both chambers, but needed the approval of three-fourths of the legislature to pass the budget, because it authorized the use of money from the state's rainy day fund. Alaska had faced a $3.5 billion budget deficit due to the sharp decline in oil prices. About 90 percent of the state's general revenue comes from oil royalties and fees.State legislators, deadlocked over worker pay raises and other spending items, twice extended the legislative session, which normally ends in April. The additional sessions cost the state an estimated  $430,000 as of June 5. The budget deal averts a threatened July 1 partial government shutdown. In preparation, the state sent layoff notices to 10,000 state employees on June 1.While Alaskans were relieved, many argued the state should develop a long-term financial strategy less dependent on the volatile price of oil. Gov. Bill Walker (I) met with more than 200 Alaskans at the University of Fairbanks on June 5 to talk about such a strategy. The state revenue commissioner broached what have historically been politically untouchable issues, like a state income tax and changes to the Alaska Permanent Fund, the portion of state oil revenues that is invested and used to pay cash dividends to residents.Senate Majority Leader John Coghill (R) said in an interview that broader economic development in the state was essential to long-term fiscal stability. Coghill supports lobbying the federal government to open more lands to development, or at least allowing the state to build roads through them. The federal government owns more than 60 percent of Alaska’s land. “We have got to diversify, there is no question about it,” Coghill said."

But landslides from the powerful April 25 earthquake had closed the main highway and, five days after the quake, Dr. Haque and a medical team from AmeriCares drove eight hours on muddy side roads to reach the town. Carrying medicine and medical supplies, the team hoped to provide care to survivors. Arughat is in Dhading District, one of the hardest hit. When they arrived, Dr. Haque was stunned. His parents had told him they were fine after the earthquake and that he did not need him to come home. But walking down the main street, he found every building damaged or completely destroyed. ""It was the second largest commercial center in Dhading and Gorkha districts and now it's gone,"" he said in disbelief. When Dr. Haque reached his home, his heart dropped: His parents, once comfortably middle class, were living in a tent near the rubble that had been their family home. The couple who had sent him to medical school were left with nothing - not even cooking utensils. It was obvious that Dr. Haque's parents had sought to protect their son from the truth. Dr. Swati Jha, an AmeriCares doctor on the team, has worked in disasters before but even she was taken aback. ""We were prepared for the injuries but not the sorrow,"" she says. The team met with local leaders in the gathering dusk, learned the village clinic had run out of medicine, and made a plan to run a mobile medical clinic. The next morning, Dr. Haque, Dr. Jha and three nurses set up a makeshift clinic under trees. As word of the clinic spread, residents began lining up to receive care - survivors had lacerations and broken bones; mothers carried children who had been rescued from the rubble. By the end of the day 375 patients received treatment. As Dr. Haque worked, the severity of the damage began to sink in. The chatter among patients was not about how long it would take to recover, but if they would ever rebuild. Wounds would heal, broken bones would knit, but the town that this doctor called home might never rise again. Perhaps the first days are the easy part - the initial response when medicine and bandages are what's needed. More difficult are the months and years that follow. Not just the monsoon rains that have everyone in Nepal working hard to put roofs, floors and supplies in place, but the repair of communities that are broken in myriad ways.For example, more than 1,000 clinics are destroyed or damaged, including the one in Arughat. They will take years to rebuild, and it will require a concerted effort of the government, multilateral organizations and aid organizations, including AmeriCares. Just as important are people's hearts and minds. The anxiety from this earthquake and its many aftershocks is already causing stomach aches and sleeplessness. In the months and years ahead, stress could damage individuals and families. When an earthquake wipes hometowns off maps, psychosocial care is critical and is always part of a long-term, comprehensive response. As the AmeriCares team retraced the muddy route to Kathmandu the next day to organize more medical camps in devastated areas, Dr. Haque stayed behind. To ease his personal pain and loss, he needed a dose of medicine that only his parents could deliver. Michael J. Nyenhuis is President and CEO of AmeriCares, an emergency response and global health organization that has delivered more than $12 billion in humanitarian aid to 164 countries."
