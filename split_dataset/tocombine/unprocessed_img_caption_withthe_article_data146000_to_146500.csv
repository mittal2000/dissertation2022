Use of the drugs hit their highest points a few months before the date of divorce. The data also indicated that individuals' use of these drugs decreased after the divorce.What's more, the researchers determined that people are nearly twice as likely to be taking the drugs just before getting a divorce than those who aren't divorcing.This isn't the first time a study has looked at how divorce and marital problems affect a person's well-being.
