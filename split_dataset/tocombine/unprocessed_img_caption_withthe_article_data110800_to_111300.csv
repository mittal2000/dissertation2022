0,RELIGION,Martin Scorsese To Direct Movie About Jesuit Missionaries,,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/martin-scorsese-silence_n_5669702.html,,2014-09-07,"LONDON, ENGLAND - FEBRUARY 16: Director Martin Scorsese attends the EE British Academy Film Awards 2014 at The Royal Opera House on February 16, 2014 in London, England. (Photo by Anthony Harvey/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7ed9d2100000002c91acf.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Although evangelical moviemakers have been in the spotlight lately with features such as “Son of God” and “God’s Not Dead,” at least one other prominent, mainstream director is also turning — or returning — to religion.Martin Scorsese, whose 1988 film “The Last Temptation of Christ” ignited national controversy, is negotiating with Paramount Studios to distribute a new movie about Jesuit missionaries, according to the show business newspaper Variety.The historical drama “Silence,” stars Andrew Garfield and Liam Neeson and begins shooting in Taiwan later this year. Based on Shusaku Endo’s 1980 novel of the same name, it’s a dark, true tale set in 17th-century Japan.The Jesuit order sends a young priest (Garfield) to find his Portuguese mentor who has been missing for 10 years. Rome believes the older Jesuit (Neeson) may have renounced his faith under torture during the severe persecution of Christian missionaries and converts.This is the third time Hollywood studio and serious directors have attempted to capture the Jesuits’ sometimes-heroic efforts beyond Europe:* In 1986, director Roland Joffe made “The Mission,” from Robert Bolt’s original screenplay. Its cast (Jeremy Irons, Robert De Niro) included small parts played by a young Neeson and the real-life, rebellious Jesuit priest Daniel Berrigan. “The Mission” tells the (mostly) true story of 18th-century Jesuit missionaries who died defending Guarani Indians from Portuguese slavery in the South American jungle. The film, which surfaced recently on cable’s Sundance Channel, won an Oscar for cinematography, and the Grand Prize at Cannes. * In 1991, director Bruce Beresford filmed “Black Robe,” which Brian Moore adapted from his novel of the same name. The brutal film depicts a French Jesuit’s dogged but ultimately failed work among the Iroquois, Algonquin and Huron in 17th-century Quebec. It illustrates that, when culture contact is involved, even the best intentions can yield disaster.What accounts for this continuing cinematic fascination with the Jesuits, especially now, with the first Jesuit pope, and an increasingly progressive Latin American at that?It’s possible — and probably likely — that Hollywood’s Jesuit attraction is as much ideological as theological.In “The Mission,” the character who played the Vatican’s emissary, charged with ordering the Spanish Jesuits to abandon their communal agricultural settlements, complains about “Jesuit contempt for the authority of the state.” But, as a former Jesuit himself, the cardinal also acknowledges that “the paradise of the poor never pleases those who rule above them.”In “Silence,” which is scheduled to open in the fall of 2015, the Japanese feudal lords are just as threatened by the Jesuits as are the Portuguese in “The Mission.”The Rev. Antoni Ucerler, a Jesuit historian who has consulted on the film with Scorsese and his production team, points out that it was the loyalty of local Christians to a “divine Lord” that transcended the iron rule of the Tokugawa shoguns that authorities feared most. “Such a faith undermined the entire system of absolute rule,” he said. “For this reason they called it the ‘evil teaching.’”All three films depict the order’s willingness to incorporate, rather than simply condemn, indigenous practices some in Rome considered anathema.Jesuits also allowed prayer in native languages and rejected coerced conversions. The Rev. Thomas J. Reese notes that, just as Christianity moved away from its Jewish character when its geographic center shifted from the Middle East to Europe, so Jesuit missionaries adapted when they brought the gospel to North and South America, and to Asia.“Jesuit missionaries were on the forefront of globalization before the term became trendy,” Reese said. “Their lives and ministries dramatized the meeting of civilizations. … What was a personal encounter in their time is global in ours. Today we face the same religious, cultural, and moral issues they did but on a global scale. That’s high drama.”The Jesuits attempted to assimilate or transform the local culture. For example, they saw Chinese ancestor “worship” as veneration — similar to Europeans praying to saints — and therefore acceptable.Competing orders — like the more conservative Franciscans and Dominicans — complained to the Vatican that the Jesuits’ syncretism gave them an unfair advantage in gaining converts. They claimed the Jesuits ignored, if not accepted, practices like infanticide, promiscuity, divorce, remarriage, and nature worship.Church leaders went back and forth on the issue, but on a 1987 visit to Chile, Pope John Paul II seemed to side with the early Jesuits, telling a gathering of Mapuche Indians he wanted “to encourage the Mapuches to conserve with a healthy pride the culture of their people; the traditions and customs, the language and their own values.”Jesuits with a long memory must have been pleased."

Atop this list are links of the outbreak to the climate crisis and global inequality, mal-distribution of wealth, and austerity-driven cuts in public services that have greatly contributed to the rapid spread of Ebola.  Equally underreported is the inadequate disaster planning for U.S. health services and how poorly prepared U.S. hospitals are for epidemics like Ebola, other epidemics, and even natural disasters as a result of misplaced priorities in a profit-driven health care system and short sighted public health budget cuts.  Start with severely skewed, neo-liberal programs in a global economy dominated by international banks and the governments aligned with them that have starved health programs and other public services while shifting resources to transnational corporations and other wealthy interests.  Thus we have health systems in the global south teetering on the edge of collapse, unable to effectively respond to disease outbreaks, much less daily health crises, and international relief agencies begging for funds.  Even the World Health Organization, the United Nations agency who has as a prime purpose to ""direct international health efforts, tackle epidemics and help in emergencies, (has been) badly weakened by budget cuts in recent years,"" the New York Times reported September 3. The WHO, the Times noted has been hobbled in its ability to respond, and its ""outbreak and emergency response units have been slashed"" with a drain in the staff needed to help blunt Ebola and similar epidemics.  A Robin Hood Tax on the Banks Would Help  One way to reverse this trend would be further enactment of the Robin Hood tax to levy a transaction fee on the trading of stocks, bonds, derivatives and other financial instruments from the very banks and institutions that have so cratered the global economy. The proposed U.S. version is HR 1579.  Hundreds of billions of dollars would be raised by wider enactment of the Robin Hood tax, funds that could be used directly to attack under funding of health programs and poverty that contribute to the outbreaks and their rapid spread.  Robin Hood funds would also help mitigate the effects of the climate crisis, which also has links to Ebola. Drought conditions have accelerated deforestation and reduced animal habitats that have brought humans into closer contact with infected fruit bats and monkeys, and crop loss that results in more reliance on eating infected meat.  In 2008, Scientific American listed 12 major diseases likely to see upticks due to the climate crisis, including cholera, bird flu, lyme disease, yellow fever, malaria-related ailments, sleeping sickness, poisonous algal blooms, tuberculosis, plague and Ebola.  A dearth of Protective Gear for Embattled Health Workers  Inadequate funding of health resources is another major reason for the deadly shortfall of protective gear for nurses, doctors and other health workers.  Of the more than 2,000 who have already died in West Africa, about 10 percent are health workers, an ""unprecedented"" infection rate, says the WHO. ""Health workers on the frontline are becoming infected and are dying in shocking numbers,"" noted Dr. Joanne Liu, president of Doctors Without Borders.   Many staff do not even have access to gloves and masks, much less full protective equipment, such as hazmat-style protective suits. Even in dedicated Ebola wards, protective gear is often scarce.  One nurse at a hospital in Monrovia, Liberia's capital, said she and her colleagues have resorted to cutting up their old uniforms or overalls and tying them on their heads. They cut holes in the fabric, so they can see.   Much of the gear must be destroyed after use, so wards need a constant flow of equipment. Doctors and nurses are overwhelmed by a surge of patients and there aren't enough hazard suits to keep them safe. Health care workers can go through thousands of the suits a week.  To protest the lack of protective equipment while risking their lives, nurses and other health workers have gone on strike in Liberia and Sierra Leone, two of the hardest hit countries.  Working directly with groups on the ground, primarily the International Medical Corps, National Nurses United, through our Registered Nurse Response Network is requesting donations to provide protective equipment for nurses. Here's how you can help:   Are We Prepared in the U.S.? No.  NNU is also warning of a dangerous lack of disaster planning and emergency preparedness in the U.S. The lack of preparation here illustrates the value we place on caring in a country that has no universal health care model and societal protection and has made profit the prime directive in healthcare.   Silence equals death was the legacy of years of neglect of the AIDS pandemic. Apparently the lesson has still not been learned.  Ebola scares have already occurred in several U.S. locales with the fears of the presence of patients who may have been exposed to the Ebola virus. While tests for those have so far proved negative, the screen has been pulled back on a disaster in waiting.  In a Sacramento, Ca. Kaiser Permanente hospital the patient who prompted the alarm there reportedly sat in the emergency room for at least a half hour without being screened or isolated.  Kaiser nurses say lack of patient screening is just one small example of a widespread failure to have in place disaster plans or training of RNs or other staff on how to handle emergencies - not just for Ebola but for other disease outbreaks, such as SARS, or natural disasters like earthquakes.  Our Interconnected World  ""Like it or not we live in an interconnected world,"" was how Centers for Disease Control Director Tom Frieden aptly put it. Ebola is ""not just a problem for West Africa, it's a problem for the world, and the world needs to respond.""  An ""interconnected world"" where all of us are drawn together by global economics, political decisions, health and environmental crises, social structures, culture, and travel.  An ""interconnected world"" because factors that have spurred the spread of Ebola, the climate crisis, deforestation, cuts in public health services, poverty, and mal-distribution of wealth affect us all.  An ""interconnected world"" because U.S. hospitals and our fractured healthcare system are not equipped to handle an outbreak of Ebola here, or other pandemics that are sure to come.  Disasters are made not just in rural West African villages, but also in government and corporate offices, with decisions to slash public services, funding for health programs, or putting private profit over public protection  Emergency preparedness includes not cutting vital services at the behest of bankers and deficit-obsessed politicians that put millions at risk, or economic programs that leave much of the world population in poverty with few resources when disaster strikes."

The researchers said air pollution specifically could significantly increase the risk of malnutrition in developing nations.

And he criticized the senator for lobbing partisan attacks instead of laying out solutions to the country's problems.""I agree that Harry Reid is stopping progress on a lot of things, but so are the Republicans in the House,"" he added.An animated Roberts pushed the advantage just before the debate's close, when he questioned Orman about which party he would caucus with if elected to the Senate.""I just want to know when you're going to take a stand and tell us what party you'll caucus with,"" Roberts said, raising his voice. ""Where you gonna be?""The moderator interjected before Orman could respond, citing time constraints.On Thursday, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach ruled that Taylor's name would remain on the ballot in November, despite the Democrat's statement that he had legally terminated his candidacy.

The maximum penalty if convicted is death.""The inquiries ... exposed humiliating facts and the extent of the largest conspiracy and treason carried out by the terrorist Brotherhood organization against the nation through a network of spies,"" it said in a three-page statement.The public prosecutor said Mursi's aides were involved in leaking to Qatari intelligence and Al Jazeera, documents which exposed the location of and weapons held by the Egyptian armed forces and detailed the country's foreign and domestic policies.The Qatari Foreign Ministry in Doha did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the accusations. Al Jazeera, which has been banned from Egypt, has denied any bias in reporting events there or any role in aiding the Brotherhood.The Brotherhood dismissed the charges as political.""Today is the start of yet another kangaroo trial... Mursi's trials are politically motivated cases with trumped up charges and a corrupt judiciary preciding over it,"" Abdulla El-Haddad, a Brotherhood spokesman based in Britain, said by email.Mursi faces trial in five other cases as well, on charges ranging from violence to insulting the judiciary.While Sisi has gone on to election as president, Mursi and other Brotherhood leaders as well as the leading lights of the 2011 popular uprising that toppled autocrat Hosni Mubarak, many of them secular activists, now languish in jail.Hopes of democratic change inspired by the revolt in the most populous Arab country have since faded.Sisi promised during his election campaign that the Muslim Brotherhood would cease to exist under his rule.Egyptian security forces killed hundreds of Brotherhood supporters during protests against Mursi's ouster and thousands of others have since been jailed.Egypt's oldest Islamist movement, once among Egypt's most formidable political forces, has been branded a terrorist group and its assets have been seized by the state. The Brotherhood formally renounced violence as a means of political change decades ago and has denied any role in more recent bloodshed. THE SECRETARY, HIS DAUGHTER AND THE AIR STEWARDIn a detailed statement, the prosecutor said his inquiry had found that Mursi's secretary Amin al-Srifi abused his position to slip documents from Egypt's security agencies to Jordanian Al Jazeera journalist Alaa Sabalan via his own daughter Karima and four other intermediaries.It said Sabalan later flew to Doha and met with Al Jazeera news editor Ibrahim Hilal and a senior Qatari intelligence officer and a deal was reached for Mursi's aides to hand over the documents in return for $1 million.It added that part of that sum was paid after documents were handed over at Doha airport by an Egyptair steward who acted as a go-between. Subsequent interrogations had also linked Mursi and his office manager Ahmed Abdelatti to the case, it said.Egypt's public prosecutor charged Mursi and his two aides, Abdelatti and Srifi, as well as seven others including Sabalan and the air steward in the case. Three of the accused, including Sabalan and senior Jazeera editor Hilal, are at large and the prosecutor called for their arrest pending trial.Egypt's rulers are deeply suspicious of Qatar and anyone who supports the Brotherhood. Egyptian authorities have long since closed down the Al Jazeera office in Cairo.Earlier this year, an Egyptian court jailed three Al Jazeera journalists for up to 10 years on charges of aiding ""a terrorist group"" by broadcasting misinformation that harmed national security. Al Jazeera has said the charges are baseless. (Additional reporting by Angus McDowall in Riyadh, Editing by Mark Heinrich)"

From Egypt to Iraq, these ancient churches have not only survived through centuries of hardship, foreign invasions, and domestic repression, they have also played an important role contributing to Arab culture and Islamic civilization. Given the unsettling hostilities of the post-Iraq and post-Arab Spring Middle East, the region's minority religious and ethnic groups find themselves at great risk. Caught in the midst of sectarian conflicts brought on by war, occupation, repression,and severe social and political dislocation, vulnerable communities have paid a terrible price, most especially in Syria and Iraq. Whether forced to flee the violence of the civil wars that have ravaged these countries, or expelled by murderous extremists as part of genocidal ""cleansing"" campaigns, the size of these once vibrant Christian communities have been so depleted, that some rightly fear their extinction in their homelands. Because these ancient churches date back to the time of Christ and have added richness and texture to the culture of the Arab East, it is inconceivable to imagine Egypt, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, or Iraq without their Copts, Maronites, Assyrian/Chaldeans, and other Catholic and Orthodox Christian communities. In a real sense, what is at stake is not just the survival of these important minorities; it is the future of the region, itself. In a word, intolerant and violent extremist groups like ISIS and their kin, pose an existential challenge not only to Christians, but to all Arabs and Muslims -- asking them to look to the future and imagine the kind of society they want to emerge from the current turmoil.   Of course, given the onslaught of ISIS in Syria and Iraq and their horrific displays of violence and intolerance, the immediate question before us is what is to be done now to defend Christians and other minorities put at risk by the raging conflict. This will be the topic of a conference, ""In Defense of Christians"", which will take place in Washington next week. The event will bring together the leaders of six of the churches of the Middle East, lawmakers and activists from a number of non-governmental organizations devoted to human rights and religious freedom. For several reasons, I am participating in the event both as an advisor to the group and a speaker. In the first place, I am a Maronite Catholic and an Arab-American, deeply committed to my heritage and the land of my father and forefathers, and concerned about the survival of my rite and that of the other Christian communities in the Arab World. I am also participating because I am an American who believes that my country, and the West in general, has, on too many occasions, negatively contributed to the conflicts that are unsettling the Middle East today. I am concerned lest we err again taking steps, out of blind ignorance or sheer folly, which would only make the regional situation more volatile and precarious. I am concerned, for example, that some of the loudest voices calling for action to defend the Christians in Iraq today come from the far right. It is disturbing, of course, that a decade ago as the Bush Administration blundered its way into Iraq, this wing of the political spectrum was too busy beating the drums of war to hear the warnings coming from Iraq's Christians about the impact that the war and the pathetic misguided occupation would have on their communities. This same crowd went deaf again to the plight of Iraq's Christians during the brutal civil war that followed, with its ""ethnic cleansing"" that reduced the country's Christian population from 1.4 million to 400,000. Does defending Christians mean that Saddam should have been tolerated because he provided more protection for Christians than the sectarian pogroms that followed? Most certainly not. But because those who are now the most strident advocates for a U.S. military-led assault on Iraq and Syria are the very same folks whose policies led to the current crisis, I believe we should, at the very least, be wary of their advocacy. Just as it is important that we be concerned not to allow the defense of Christians to serve as a cover for the agenda of the war-hawks, we must not allow it to degenerate into Muslim-bashing. Islamophobes may draw applause from some in Washington, but their inflammatory rhetoric will only harm the fate of Christians in the Middle East. In the end, they appear to be more focused on fomenting a ""clash of civilizations"" then contributing to a reformed and reconstructed Arab World. What should also be of concern are those who either want to defend only some Christians -- ignoring for example, the hardships faced by Palestinian Christians living under Israeli occupation -- or those whose advocacy is limited exclusively to Christians. As a Christian and an Arab-American, I reject both approaches. I cannot imagine Palestine without its Arab Christian community. All too often, American evangelicals come to the Holy Land to see the sights, while ignoring the indigenous Christians struggling to survive in the face of an unrelenting occupation. The famed little town of Bethlehem has lost most of its land to Israeli land-grabs, and its people are hemmed in by a 30-foot concrete wall. It is easier for an American tourist to travel thousands of miles to visit Jerusalem, then it is for a Bethlehemite to go a few miles to pray in the Holy City. And as a Christian, I cannot counsel the approach of those who would extend their support to Christians-only and say, in effect, ""the hell with the rest"". The defense of Christians must be holistic and comprehensive. Minorities are most secure when they live in societies that are inclusive and representative, tolerant and respectful of the rights and contributions of all their citizens.To be sure, ISIS must be defeated and dictators must be removed. But we will only succeed in defending Christians and all other minorities if the sectarian extremists and the dictators are replaced by systems of governance that do not establish one religion or sect above others. As demanding and far-reaching as that may be, it is the challenge we must face. Follow @AAIUSA for more."

Instead, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen congratulated troop contributing nations on completing their combat mission, saying ""We have done what we pledged to do.""Meanwhile, in Afghanistan, the two presidential candidates remain locked in a bitter dispute over who won and what the loser will get, with Taliban fighters exploiting political divisions and NATO's reduced presence by launching ever-larger offensive attacks.At the end of this year, NATO ends its combat presence, leaving behind only a small training and assistance mission. It will then reduce financial support for the Afghan National Security Forces, which will kick in around the same time as a massive drop in foreign assistance -- a 50 percent cut by the U.S. is already approved. By continuing with a timetable that is externally driven, regardless of internal conditions, and with an economic squeeze from aid cuts looming, NATO is sending the wrong signals to the Afghan people and to the Taliban, and imperiling security. Amid the muted self-congratulation at the NATO summit, privately many know their work is not done. The drawdown of training and financial support is necessary, but it needs to happen at a responsible speed, so that the security and rights gains can be consolidated. This would require a candid assessment of current security conditions: the last thing NATO leaders wanted to do in Wales. The fact is the conflict in Afghanistan has regained intensity: overall attacks have increased. In recent months we've seen a stark impact of NATO's diminished air presence: in many areas the Taliban are now able to move in their hundreds to stage attacks, where previously they mostly relied on improvised explosive devices. Today civilian casualties are at near-record levels, according to the UN. There are also reports the Afghan Taliban are being bolstered by Pakistani Taliban and other militant groups who prefer to fight in Afghanistan while the Pakistani army wages a military operation in their safe havens in Waziristan. The Afghan security forces (ANSF) have not crumbled as some predicted, nor is Kabul about to fall, but the ANSF are being killed in large numbers, and a number of districts in several provinces are vulnerable to Taliban takeovers. Meanwhile, in the United States, the debate remains centered on troop numbers, which are set to fall to around 15,000, including around 9,800 non-combat U.S. troops. Less attention is given to the fact that funding for the ANSF will soon be cut sharply: the US and other NATO members have offered $4.1 billion a year to cover the costs of 228,000 army and police. This entails shrinking the Afghan security forces by more than a third. There are no clear plans for how such demobilization would take place. The Afghan government says it needs $6 billion to maintain its security forces; a recent report commissioned by the U.S. Congress agreed, recommending that the current Afghan force levels should be supported until 2018. As NATO considers these funding cuts and exit plans, one of their greatest challenges remains unmet: the Afghan security forces don't just need to be capable of withstanding an insurgency, they need to be accountable to the Afghan people. Just as the early mistakes and abuses by the international military inflamed the insurgency, Afghan security forces continue to drive some communities away from their government. Despite widespread reporting of these abuses, including executions, electrocutions, and holes being drilled in people's heads, the government has mostly failed to respond. Two Afghan security officials recently stated publicly that they have a 'kill not capture' policy for Taliban. Senior U.S. officials have consistently made their support for such notorious officials very public, so it was welcome news this week that the White House has asked the Afghan government to investigate 15 incidents where illegal executions took place, seven of them this year. The U.S. has warned that if such abuse continues, assistance for the Afghan units responsible could be cut, under the requirements of the Leahy law, which bars U.S. funding from going to abusive security forces. The new Afghan government will need to act quickly to prevent this, and rebuild trust by prioritizing accountability. The smaller the NATO presence, the lower the chance of reform. There are still many reasons to be optimistic about Afghanistan, but they could evaporate if these challenges aren't faced up to. The summit should have been the forum for a realistic review of NATO's ability to help protect Afghanistan's long-term security, even if it means admitting uncomfortable facts. In the background looms Iraq. While comparisons can be overstated, since these are two very different contexts; NATO leaders must be asking themselves whether the Iraqi crisis should make them rethink how quickly they withdraw their support for Afghanistan. This would mean ensuring a more responsible reduction of financial and training support for the ANSF, and prioritizing accountability and protecting human rights. Those that are betting against NATO and the Afghan people's chosen future expect that impatience and other international crises will lead NATO's leaders to abandon its commitments. NATO leaders can still prove those wagers wrong."

(AP Photo/Mstislav Chernov)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc13ced230000380093da15.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. Today, we turn to Russia's involvement in the crisis in Ukraine.Finally good news out of Ukraine. After five months of fighting between government troops and pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country, representatives of both parties reached an agreement on Friday to end hostilities and negotiate a permanent settlement. Looming large over the negotiations was the question of Russian involvement in the conflict and western leaders' accusations that Moscow had systematically worked to deepen the Ukrainian crisis. The extent of Russia's involvement in separatist violence in past months has been fiercely contested. Russia denies it has had any hand at all in the violence, while Ukraine and its Western allies accuse Moscow of having sent thousands of troops and military equipment  across the border. To better understand reports of a Russian presence in east Ukraine, The WorldPost turned to Elena Racheva, a special correspondent for Russia's Novaya Gazeta opposition newspaper. Racheva says that she has found ""convincing"" evidence that Russian troops have been sent to fight in Ukraine.Who are the main groups fighting the government in east Ukraine?I had the chance to talk to some of the rebels in the Russian town of Donetsk [not to be confused with the Ukrainian town of Donetsk]. About three-quarters of them were originally from Ukraine's Donetsk and Luhansk regions and a quarter of them were Russian citizens. Many of the rebels from both of these groups had fought in the Russian wars in Chechnya or Afghanistan. They wanted to fight again. They had blindly trusted Russian media and repeated Russian TV stories about Ukrainian forces using phosphorus bombs and children being crucified. Relatives of Russian soldiers told me that while soldiers were occasionally sent on short-term missions inside Ukraine in July, the situation started to change at the beginning of August, when the Ukrainian army was able to push back the separatist rebels. Russia then started sending in larger regiments and military equipment, although without any identifying markings or license plates. I have no idea what the current proportion of Ukrainian separatist volunteers to Russian troops is. No journalist does. Does this mean that Russia is actually sending forces to Ukraine?Some soldiers were going voluntarily in June and July. Their relatives told me that army chiefs offered them big salaries to retire from the military and go to Ukraine as ""volunteers"" without official documents, although only a small number of soldiers agreed to do this.The situation changed later on, and soldiers are now forced to go. Usually it works like this -- the regiment is sent to the Russian-Ukrainian border for ""training"" and after a while they get the order to go into Ukraine. I know of at least one case when soldiers who refused were threatened with prosecution.Sometimes the soldiers aren't even told where are they going. For example, the uncle of one seriously wounded paratrooper told me that on Aug. 3, his nephew was told they were being deployed from Ulyanovsk in central Russia to Chebarkul in the east. After a few hours they realized they weren't going east at all, but west towards Ukraine. He didn’t jump out of the car and didn’t refuse to go into Ukraine, but I doubt he could be considered a volunteer. What evidence is there that Russian troops are fighting in Ukraine?The evidence is simple but convincing -- soldiers who have been killed, wounded or captured. I personally talked to the relatives of paratroopers from the 331st regiment of Russia's 98th Guards Airborne Division, who were killed and captured about 20 km [about 12 miles] inside Ukraine. I also spoke to the family of a soldier from the 31st Air Assault Brigade from Ulyanovsk who lost his leg in a fight in Ukraine, and the mother of a soldier from Division 2777 based in Chechnya, who died near the Ukrainian town of Snizhne. Russian officials admitted that troops had been captured, but President Vladimir Putin said they got lost while patrolling the border. How is this being covered in the Russian media?Quite poorly. There are not many free media outlets that dare to write about such things. State media only publishes the official version of the events. They tell their audience that Russia is not fighting in Ukraine, that soldiers captured there got lost on the border and that those who were killed have not died because they won't admit these men ever existed.The independent media do try to present all the evidence they can find. For example, one small regional newspaper called Pskovskaya Guberniya reported on the secret funeral of two paratroopers from the town of Pskov who had been killed in Ukraine. This local newspaper with three staff writers became the first media outlet to prove Russian casualties in this war. The newspaper's website went down within a few hours of publishing the story because of the huge traffic. A few days later the newspaper's publisher Lev Shlosberg was beaten up near his house. He's still in the hospital with a broken nose and serious concussion. He says the attack was revenge for their reporting. How have Russians reacted to reports of their troops fighting in Ukraine?Russian society is terribly split. After I reported on the death of a 20-year-old Russian lance sergeant in Ukraine hundreds of people contacted his mother on social media. One-third offered condolences, one-third accused her of lying, and another third, mostly Ukrainians, said he deserved to die for fighting in Ukraine. She was hysterical and I felt terrible -- neither of us expected that level of hatred. Each third reveals something about Russia's reaction. Some people, like myself, feel a mixture of shame, horror, anger, regret and remorse. Some feel pure hatred towards the troops. And others just trust state media and don’t believe its happening at all. I’m afraid the last group is the biggest. But as more and more evidence that Russia is involved in this war comes out, people are beginning the painful process of accepting this. It will not be easy, and it will take us some time to move from denial to understanding, acceptance and regret.This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity."

I said you should love Beyonce. You shouldn't love her because she's beautiful. You don't even need to like her music. You should love Beyonce, because she's a black woman at the top of her game. We need it.I've been a proud member of the BeyHive for some time now. Sometimes, I've purposely annoyed friends and colleagues alike with my passion for all things Beyonce. Often, I'm pushed to defend just why I'm such a big fan. Queen Bey celebrated a birthday on Thursday. Lots of her fans offered shout outs on social media, but as usual, I noticed plenty of Beyonce haters trying to crash the party. It got me thinking: Aside from actually enjoying her music, exactly why am I on the Beyonce brand bandwagon? The reason: Beyonce fills an important role in our culture. We live in a world where black women are often told we're not enough. Society is obsessed with our hair. It can still be a struggle for us to find the right shade of makeup at the drug store. We're apparently less likely to get married. We're more likely to die from breast cancer. The list of daunting stats pertaining to us really goes on and on. These are the messages about black women the mainstream media pushes out most of the time. In 2014, some big television networks still need public pressure to put black women on the air. Remember all the hype about finally casting a black woman on Saturday Night Live? Seriously. Why did it take all that? Let's not even talk about what went down with Pam Oliver at Fox Sports. Beyonce is a black woman adorned by millions around the world for her talent. She didn't rise to fame on a reality show. She did it the old fashioned way. She earned it through hard work. She's a black woman who dropped an album, went on tour and dominated the award show circuit all within the past year. She's a black woman with control over content and her own creativity. She has power. The kind of influence that rivals Oprah Winfrey and Michelle Obama. This is a part of the American dream black women are too often shut out of, even those in Beyonce's same industry. Black women who work hard should be recognized and paid top dollar for their talents. Beyonce has reached the pinnacle of such. Sure, most of us won't make Beyonce money, but that's not the point. The reality is according to U.S. Census Bureau data, African-American women earn just 70 cents for every dollar paid to men, and just 64 cents for every dollar paid to white, non-Hispanic men. If Beyonce's celebrity can inspire any of us to push past those barriers, I'm going to rock with her.Now sure, some of you are thinking but she's an entertainer. An entertainer who dances around scantily clad at that. She also wears weaves and is a light-skinned black woman. Things the mainstream may accept with greater ease. It doesn't matter. She's still a black woman who has reached a level success that needs to be seen. Anytime a black woman is valued on a level like Beyonce is, it's a win for us all.Beyonce has also managed to maintain quite a bit moral dignity in a business that makes it difficult. She got married first, then had a baby. We've never seen a leaked sex tape from her. Aside from Jay Z and Solange's elevator-gate, Beyonce's never been a celeb caught up in any serious public nuisances. She's represented pretty darn well.On the real though, I'm using ""love"" a bit loosely here. You don't need be an obsessive Beyonce fan. You don't need to go download all her music. Just recognize black female excellence for what it is. Beyonce is that."

Ming sets off to help save Africa's elephants and rhinos from extinction by changing a 1,000-year-old Chinese tradition and ending the trade of illegal ivory and rhino horn in his native China in an Animal Planet special airing in the fall. (AP Photo/Animal Planet)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb15d543c000032000bcbf5.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since retiring from the Houston Rockets in 2011, basketball player Yao Ming has set his sights on some impressive new goals -– this time without a net. Ming, a native of Shanghai, China, has vowed to put an end to the ivory tusk trade in his home country to stave off the endangered African elephant’s path to extinction.To bring his mission to the masses, Ming, 33, traveled to Africa with the WildAid foundation to document the poaching crisis for a new documentary, “The End of the Wild.” In a recent interview with The Washington Post, the long-time animal rights activist opened up about his heartbreaking journey to Kenya and South Africa.“Before that [journey], it was more of a number for me — how many tons of ivory, how much money comes out of this business. Sometimes the number is cold,” he said. “After you visit Africa, it is very unique. I felt that I built some kind of special connection with the animals.”Ivory has long been used for lavish gifts, including jewelry, guns, and sculptures; in China, ivory carving dates back centuries. But the ivory trade continues to decimate the world's elephant population. Demand for the rare material risen in China along with the country's growing wealthy class; the price of ivory has tripled in China over the last four years. It’s estimated that each year, 30,000 elephants are killed for their ivory tusks, according to WildAid. “The Chinese hold the key to the elephants’ future,” Iain Douglas-Hamilton, founder of Save the Elephants, told the New York Times last year. “If things continue the way they are, many countries could lose their elephants altogether.”Ming originally partnered with WildAid in 2006 for a different animal-rights crisis. He campaigned with the group in China against the killing of an estimated 1.5 million sharks every week for shark fin soup, a delicacy, according to the Associated Press. Sales have since fallen between 50 and 70 percent, the Washington Post reports, thanks in part to a ban on serving shark fin soup at government banquets. Now, Ming is hoping people in his home country will once again open their eyes to another animal cruelty. In addition to the documentary, his ""Say No To Ivory"" campaign has also involved television ads, billboards, and petitioning the Chinese government to ban ivory sales. “China is a rising economic country. More and more people are living in better economic conditions now, but we have to balance our desires,” Ming told the Post. “If we don’t balance that, it is pretty obvious we cannot live alone on this planet. If there is a list of species going extinct, I am pretty sure we won’t be last on that list.”"

Onlookers -- including police -- watched as she was beaten to death in a public place. Pakistan's Human Rights Commission reported that 869 ""honor killings"" took place in 2013 -- due to lack of reporting out of shame or fear of additional violence, however, the number is undoubtedly significantly higher.In Egypt, ongoing sexual violence against women protesters has not quelled; just recently, a woman suffered a horrific mass sexual assault while attending the inaugural celebrations for incoming President Sisi.Violence against women and girls touches every corner of the globe and is one of the world's most pervasive human rights violations. According to the World Health Organization, one out of every three women worldwide will be physically, sexually or otherwise abused during her lifetime -- with rates reaching a shocking 70 percent in some countries. This is nothing short of an epidemic. This violence ranges from rape and domestic abuse to acid burnings and human trafficking. Not only does violence impact the individual and the family, it is damaging to society: it impedes economic growth, destabilizes communities, and complicates progress on other critical issues, such as poverty and HIV and AIDS.For me, the struggle for women's human rights began the moment I was born in Tehran at the height of the Iranian Revolution, a time when the status of women was quickly deteriorating. My parents realized the dangers of raising a daughter in a social, political and legal climate that was growing increasingly oppressive toward women and girls. Although they fled to London when I was just three-weeks-old, the challenges facing women's rights in Iran became ingrained in my social consciousness.Women and girls, men and boys all share the right to live free of violence, which is, unfortunately, experienced by both men and women. Women and girls, however, disproportionately experience violence due to a deeply rooted global culture of gender discrimination. Violence is committed against women and girls as they attempt to access education -- as evidenced by the as yet unresolved mass kidnapping of more than 200 schoolgirls by Boko Haram in Nigeria. In El Salvador, women face the highest rate of femicide in the world, with 12 murders per 100,000 women each year. And we know that women are uniquely and tragically affected by armed conflict -- rape used as a weapon of war has been documented in countless conflicts around the globe.As human rights advocates, we demand that the rights of half the world's population -- women -- be respected. No one should experience violence or live in fear of it when he or she seeks to access the full range of their human rights. There is legislation here in the U.S. that would help. The bipartisan International Violence Against Woman Act (IVAWA) would make ending gender-based violence a top priority in U.S. diplomatic and foreign assistance efforts. IVAWA recognizes that while women and girls disproportionately suffer from violence, men and boys suffer from it as well. IVAWA seeks to end gender-based violence against all. It will help engage men and boys and community leaders in efforts to transform attitudes about equality and the acceptability of violence. We know that men and boys are powerful allies against violence.Through IVAWA, U.S. foreign assistance programs and funding that are already in place to address violence and increase women's opportunities would become more efficient, effective and coordinated across agencies, all without costing the taxpayer another dime.Some might ask why the United States should care about ending gender-based violence around the world? While we know there is much work to be done to end violence against women here at home, we must recognize that the status of women and girls and the stability of nations go hand-in-hand; countries with the most discriminatory laws and cultural attitudes toward women tend to also experience the greatest unrest and turmoil, which in turn directly impacts global stability. IVAWA is not only the right thing to do, but it is also the smart thing to do for U.S. national security.As some of you may know, I am an actress, and while preparing for a role often requires a study of the human condition, our job as activists and citizens of the world involves changing the human condition. The United States must assume a leadership role in ensuring equal rights for women and girls, including the right to live free from violence. Passing IVAWA is a critical step toward a future free of gender-based violence."

California law does not require public notification or an environmental review for the permit, which was issued in February.Friday's ruling was met with hisses from environmentalists who attended the hearing, some of whom participated in a protest the previous day where they chained themselves to a fence at the facility.The Kinder Morgan terminal is the most substantial oil-by-rail facility in the state, handling up to 72,000 barrels per day. The crude is unloaded from incoming trains and placed on trucks bound for a Tesoro-owned refinery in Martinez.The number of trains ferrying crude oil by rail to California from Canada and North Dakota's Bakken shale formation has jumped dramatically in recent years, prompting safety and environmental concerns.In July 2013, a train carrying crude oil derailed and exploded in a town in the Canadian province of Quebec, killing 47 people.

21,ENTERTAINMENT,Melissa McCarthy Basically Steals Bill Murray's New Movie,Christopher Rosen,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/st-vincent-movie-review_n_5776600.html,,2014-09-06,"Actors Bill Murray and Melissa McCarthy arrive at the ""St. Vincent"" premiere during the Toronto International Film Festival on Friday, Sept. 5, 2014, in Toronto. (Photo by Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5e4f0291230000a804ddd18f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Director Ted Melfi expended loads of energy while trying to get Bill Murray to star in ""St. Vincent."" That part of the ""St. Vincent"" narrative will receive a lot of coverage in the next few months, and it has already been the focal point of features posted by USA Today, the Los Angeles Times and Deadline.com. As the story goes, once Murray got involved, the rest of the cast -- including Chris O'Dowd and Naomi Watts -- fell into place. For Melfi, that might have been the biggest benefit of getting Bill Murray to star in his debut feature film. Without the enigmatic star, Melfi would have never had Melissa McCarthy.McCarthy has been praised for a number of her roles over the last four years. She was an Oscar nominee for ""Bridesmaids."" She won an Emmy. She was even good in the more dramatic second half of ""Tammy."" But ""St. Vincent"" might be her best, most effortless performance to date. She plays Maggie in the film, a struggling single mom who uses Murray's Vincent to babysit Oliver, her 12-year-old son, after school. On paper, that's a stock role if there ever was one, and the film does push Maggie to the side as it starts focusing in on Vincent and his relationship with Oliver. But as played by McCarthy, Maggie never feels like a device or cliché. Maggie's warm and funny, but in a way that McCarthy is rarely allowed to be warm and funny. Maggie's a fighter, too, and McCarthy's scenes with Murray, especially as the film's conflict comes to a head, are a true highlight. In the hours after ""St. Vincent"" debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival on Friday night, Murray has gotten a lot of the plaudits for the film, but McCarthy is every bit his equal on screen.Which, by contrast, means Murray is also pretty exceptional in Melfi's film, even as he navigates its more sentimental moments. (Let's just say ""St. Vincent"" becomes a literal title as the narrative progresses.) Melfi originally wanted Jack Nicholson for the title role, and that seems to fit with the script: Vincent often feels like the long-lost brother of Nicholson's character from ""As Good As It Gets."" But Nicholson suggested Murray, and Melfi went off to call the actor's infamous 1-800 number. (""It's not his voice on there. It's a Skytel voicemail with a menu. You have to record the message and send the message,"" Melfi told USA Today. ""It's so confusing."") Regardless of the origins, however, Murray makes Vincent his own. The character has Murray's sense of humor, but also the signature sadness that gave ""Rushmore,"" ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Broken Flowers"" so many added layers. It's kind of a greatest hits performance for the actor, and if Murray winds up as a Best Actor nominee at the 87th annual Academy Awards, it would be unexpected but not necessarily surprising (executive producer Harvey Weinstein has gotten more mileage out of far lesser works in past awards seasons). But maybe McCarthy should join him. ""The best comedic actors are great actors, because they're treating it real and honestly,"" director Paul Feig, who guided the actress to her only Oscar nomination thus far, told HuffPost Entertainment last year. McCarthy is already a great actor, just as Murray was before Wes Anderson showed up. And while ""St. Vincent"" isn't her ""Rushmore,"" it's further proof there's one of those movies in her future. We'll all be better for it whenever that finally happens.""St. Vincent"" opens in limited release on Oct. 10. A nationwide rollout follows on Oct. 24."

Amid allegations of racial profiling and excessive force, the FBI has stepped in to assist local police on the investigation. The Department of Justice has also opened up a wider probe on police in the area.So far, the key witness to the shooting has been Dorian Johnson, a friend of Brown's who was with him when he was shot. Johnson has said that Wilson started firing unprovoked, and that Brown was ""shot like an animal.""Protests raged in Ferguson in the month since the shooting, though the size of the crowd and intensity of the protests have shrunk significantly over time.Read the Post-Dispatch's article for more details of the witness account."

""That gives Iran a very powerful level from a strategic point of view. I consider Iran a bigger problem than ISIS. ISIS is a group of adventurers with a very aggressive ideology.

On Friday, nuclear talks went south after Iran failed to provide key information on its past nuclear work by an agreed-upon deadline.

No further details of the poll were immediately available.""The YouGov survey ... shows that the nationalists have taken a two-point lead and are poised to triumph in the referendum,"" the paper said.After months of surveys showing nationalists heading for defeat, recent polls have been showing the gap narrowing to the extent that they raise the real prospect that secessionists led by Alex Salmond's Scottish National Party (SNP) could achieve their goal of breaking the 307-year-old union with England.A previous YouGov poll on Sept. 1 put the lead for the ""no"" to secession campaign at just six points, down from 14 points in the middle of August and 22 points at the start of that month.But the latest average of the polls, issued on Sept. 1 by Strathclyde University Professor of Politics John Curtice, still shows the unionist lead at 10 points.The late showing by the independence camp has hit sterling on the foreign exchanges and electrified Britain's political class after its summer break.A vote to break away would be followed by negotiations with London on what to do about the currency, the national debt, North Sea oil and the future of Britain's nuclear submarine base in Scotland ahead of independence penciled in for March 24, 2016.If Scots voted to leave the United Kingdom, Prime Minister David Cameron would face calls to resign ahead of a national election in May 2015 while the opposition Labor party's chances of gaining a majority could be scuppered if it lost its Scottish lawmakers.Cameron, who is due to visit Queen Elizabeth in Scotland on Sunday, has insisted he will not resign.Nationalists accuse London of squandering Scotland's wealth and say Scotland would be one of the world's richest countries if it took control of its own destiny.Unionists, including Britain's three main political parties, say the United Kingdom is stronger if it stays together and that Scottish independence would bring significant financial, economic and political uncertainty.Politicians from the ""Better Together"" unionist campaign have been trying to tempt Scots with offers of greater devolution.This week, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown, himself a Scot, promised Edinburgh more powers over its tax, social and economic affairs if Scots voted against independence.The Observer newspaper, in an advance extract of its Sunday edition, said British ministers planned to make further concrete offers in coming days to allow Scots to devise a federal future for their country.(Reporting by Stephen Addison; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)"
