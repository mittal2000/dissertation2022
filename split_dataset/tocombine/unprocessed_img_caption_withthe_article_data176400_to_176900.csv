I never expected to be back in the dating scene, but after catching him cheating and going through a tumultuous divorce, I was thrown back into the fray.One of my most pressing questions about dating was how the sexual mores for older singles had changed during this time. There are hundreds of articles about young people and their new dating habits, usually centered around technology. They have ""hook-ups"", ""friends with benefits"" and like to change their ""Relationship Status"" on Facebook. But what about dating over fifty? What could I expect?I was fixed up with a man who was promised to be the ""catch of the century."" Fred called and asked me out for a casual dinner the following night. He was over sixty, tall, fit, intelligent and interesting. We talked about restaurants, art, travel, movies and I felt that there was a connection and chemistry.When I returned home, the phone was already ringing. Fred was calling to ask me for three more dates; I was available for two. Our second date was at a romantic piano bar and was equally as pleasant as the first. I was relaxed and enjoyed the good conversation and the flirting.Our third date was a Saturday night dinner at a beautiful romantic garden restaurant. Over spaghetti bolognese, he casually asked if I liked sex. I was caught off-guard -- it was such a random question in the context of our light banter -- but I replied with a non-committal, ""Sure, why?""He explained that he loved sex, and that when in a relationship, he expected to have sex 300 times a year. This was why he had recently broken up with his fiancee. I was flabbergasted. Did he keep a running count and post it on his refrigerator? Was this an exaggeration, the lies of a braggart, or the words of a man with a truly voracious sexual appetite? Was this the new dating norm?All I knew was that I had no interest in sex on demand. There are a few recently published books about couples trying to reinvigorate their marriage by pledging to have sex for one hundred straight days, but Fred's ultimatum was different. Here was a man on our third date setting forth my obligations if I wanted to have a relationship with him. No romance, no friendship, no getting to know one another, no interest in my needs or desires -- it was all about him. No wonder his fiancee fled.In a way, I was grateful that he blurted out his sex quota. I did not need to waste his or my time with any further dates. So much for the ""catch of the century."""
1,TRAVEL,The French Riviera Isn't Just for Billionaires,"Michael Schuermann, Contributor
Author, Paris Movie Walks",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-french-riviera-billionaires_us_5b9c5787e4b03a1dcc7dec97,"The Oligarch's Riviera, a constellation of playgrounds for billionaires and fantasists, does exist, but it is not the whole story.",2012-09-27,2012-09-26-AbramovichyachtmooredinthewatersofAntibes.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2012-09-26-AbramovichyachtmooredinthewatersofAntibes.jpg,"If Hollywood -- as some old cynic once said -- is a town where people from Missouri mistake each other for movie stars then the French Riviera is where tanning salon aficionados from provincial towns across Europe hope to be mistaken for the yacht owners of the Côte d'Azur.The Oligarch's Riviera, a constellation of playgrounds for billionaires and fantasists, does exist, but it is not the whole story. The floating Abramovich manse.The French Riviera, it turns out, isn't snooty about money or overawed. The Riviera merely regards the Russian oligarchs as the latest wave of foreign invaders, most of whom came here throughout the centuries with guns ablaze and daggers drawn. Megayachts, the French Riviera thinks, are better.But it is equally true that some of the best that the French Riviera has to offer is relatively affordable, once you have accounted for accommodation and travel. (We flew with budget airline Vueling to Nice and found our holiday rental through HomeAway.)An Active French Riviera HolidayThe Côte d'Azur offers numerous trails for short hikes of two to three hours, the perfect way to spend an active afternoon, combining great views across the sea, of splendid Mediterranean architecture and wonderful, often surprisingly undercrowded beaches. Even better: these trails are virtually free of Russian oligarchs who generally prefer the Riviera's confined spaces to her open ones. (Because they can be more easily controlled by their security and bodyguards, presumably.)Here are four of the best such trails: all of them conveniently located near the Riviera's main towns as their trailheads, all of them using a station on the busy route between Cannes and Ventimiglia (trains run roughly every 30 minutes.) AntibesThis trail around the legendary Cap d'Antibes packs a lot into its rather tight two hours of scenic drama, both natural and man-made: craggy cliff formations, stairways carved into stone and everything you would expect from a walk on the Mediterranean coastline. To get there, take a bus (line 2 from the central bus station) to Fontaine, continue straight into Avenue Mrs Beaumont and, at the end, just follow the signs to the Sentier Littoral.NiceTake a bus or the train (two stops) to the quasi-suburb of Villefranche-sur-mer. Walk into town, perhaps the prettiest along the Riviera, and turn right uphill when you see the town church. Continue all the way up, following the Campo Quadro stairway, before turning left on the Moyenne Corniche, the legendary coastal road, following the path to the semi-abandoned fortress of Mont Alban for some great views of both Nice and Villefranche. Descend to the pine forest and back to Villefranche through some lush and deep Mediterranean woodlands.CannesAsk for a map at the Cannes Tourism Office then take a ferry to the Ile Ste Marguerite and explore the island counterclockwise around the coast - for as long as you like (the full circuit will take you app. 3 hours) before cutting in to visit the fortress. The fort was the place where, in the period of the Three Musketeers, the Man In The Iron Mask was held, perhaps the world's most mysterious prisoner ever. (According to Alexandre Dumas, the Dan Brown of the 19th century, he was the twin brother of Louis XIV.) Unless you come here on a weekend in the high season, you will have much of the island to yourself. Bring your swimwear! There are numerous enchanted bays around the island - but also something to cover your feet because the ground underneath the water is often quite stony. MentonWalk from the train station down to the sea and turn left, continuing through the new town and the Old Town (leave a little time for the latter, climbing the Old Town hill at least up to the level of the baroque St Michael's church) all the way down the coast - past the town's two harbours - until you are in Italy. On the other side of the frontier, you find a collection of shops, selling mainly cigarettes and liquor, but also a coffee bar with some outside tables where you can have a ristretto and shout Ciao bella! at the girls in short skirts. Return the way you came, but look for the signs to the station of Menton Garavan on your right - from here, you can catch your train back to Nice and Cannes.  Alternatively, take a train in the opposite direction, and in 5 minutes you can be in a real Italian town, the seaside resort of Ventimiglia.

The baby, Edward Duke, arrived on Aug. 29 through a gestational surrogate.In a blog post for People, the Rancics explained that Giuliana's battle with breast cancer and their own struggle with infertility prompted them to prepare for the future. ""After our own health scares and all that we went through to finally get pregnant, it was a no-brainer for us,"" the couple wrote in a joint blog post for People. ""We’ve always taken charge of our own health and wanted to do the same for our son even before he was born.""The Rancics have partnered with the Cord Blood Registry, a large stem cell bank, to ensure parents become informed about the practice. People notes the  Rancics are paid spokespersons for Cord Blood Registry.Despite the purported advantages of banking cord blood for the potential its stem cells contain, the merits of doing so through private banks have been debated for years. (Private banks ensure that cord blood will be accessible for the family's use only, whereas public banks work more on a donation system, in which the cells can be used by anyone.)In May, Tracey Dones, a mother from New York, told ABC's ""Good Morning America""  that when she learned her 4-month-old son had osteoporosis, she was initially comforted by the fact that she had stored his cord blood with a private bank. But Dones later learned that, like many diseases, her child's osteoporosis couldn't be treated with his own stem cells because they also contained the disease. As a result, Dones ended up having to find a transplant match through a public bank. Private banking, she explained, felt like a false promise and a waste of money. ""There are so many people out there who don't really understand and they are so misled by the advertisements out there it still makes me angry,"" Dones told ""Good Morning America.""As Parents magazine reports, in the last 10 years, the majority of ""cord blood transplants that have used privately stored blood"" weren't given to the children themselves, but to family members with pre-existing conditions.Concerns have been also been raised about banks preying on the anxieties of new parents.""Childhood leukemia is one of the diseases private banks like to play up, but most kids with leukemia are cured with chemotherapy alone. If a transplant is needed, we wouldn't use a child's tainted cord blood,"" Joanne Kurtzberg with Duke University Medical Center explained to Parents.As Fox News recently noted, private cord banking can be quite costly. Initial fees can run $1,500 to $2,000, and annual storage can cost $100 to $200. The chances that a child will need their own stem cells for a transplant before the age of 10 are also slim. According to Fox, those odds are about one in 10,000, and it is still unclear how long cells can be stored for use. The Academy of Pediatrics has been outspoken about what private banking can and cannot promise, and in a 2007 report, the group concluded that the marketing the private storage of cord blood as “biological insurance” should be discouraged. ""The potential for children needing their own cord blood stem cells for future autologous use is controversial presently,"" the authors of the report wrote. Still, the academy does encourage public banking and the use of private banking in cases where a family member has a pre-existing condition or a transplant is expected to be needed in the future.  "

From the looks of Swank's recent real estate listing in Pacific Palisades, Calif., the Oscar-winning actress is far, far away from her trailer park roots. Swank listed her three story mansion Tuesday for $9,495,000, about five years after she bought it for $5,800,000.

Her first movie role was a bit part in the 1992 film ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer,"" and her first starring role was the fourth installment of the Karate Kid franchise: ""The Next Karate Kid.""However, she's best known for the roles that landed her Oscar gold; Swank won awards for her 1999 portrayal of a transgender teen in ""Boys Don't Cry"" and as a small town waitress-turned boxer in the 2004 movie ""Million Dollar Baby.""While it isn't clear why Swank is selling her home, celebrity real estate blogger Real Estalker notes that Swank bought the property in Mar. 2007, around the time she started seeing agent John Campisi.

The term ""Working Mom"" has become an institution because of the shifting societal conventions that now encourage women to follow their dreams and reach self-fulfillment. The other side of that, however, is the constant need to explain how you can be both a good mom and have a career. Somehow, working dads escaped that trap. We got it easy. We can take the kids for an outing on the weekend and be showered with praise -- as if it's enough to remember that we even have kids.As a dad, you're free to have a career, work late, travel and do it all under the pretense of feeding your family. The pressure to do more dad stuff is fairly light. Parenting is not a hobby, though, and you do not babysit your own kids. This leaves us dads with a great opportunity: To be better parents.Your most important jobIf you're still under the impression that your job at the office is important, it's time for you to rethink your priorities.Your job may pay the bills, but unless you're curing cancer or ending world hunger, the odds are that it in no way compares to your responsibilities as a father.The difference you can make in the world as a dad is incredible, as are the rewards. You will be amazed by what you'll learn as a father, and by what your children can accomplish on their own. Still, your children can accomplish so much more with your support and guidance -- your role should not be optional.If your child senses disinterest from you, they will instinctively reflect that back on themselves, believing that your unavailability was their fault.This is just how it is and you don't need a psychiatrist to tell you that. But this is the last guilt trip, I promise. The purpose of being an active father is not to avoid guilt, but to have rich and interesting experiences which will leave you feeling happier and more fulfilled.The idea is that any minute you spend paying positive attention to your kids is money in the universal bank of amazing things.No need to be perfect, or even close If you have babies or toddlers, good -- they don't know your faults yet and you can have a fresh start. But if you have older kids, they are already onto you. They may pretend to understand that you have to travel or work overtime, but they are not buying it. If you are aware of your own mistakes and bad habits, should you give up? Is it too late? Of course not.My father and I only discussed our relationship for the first time when I was 30. It was not too late. We are now great friends, and while some holes are there, we do not have a bad relationship hanging over our heads.Don't overwhelm yourself by thinking of all the things you could do differently. All you have to be is a bit better than last week. Get in the mindset that being a dad is awesome, for your kids and for you. What you want, What you need, and what your kids needWhen thinking about your kids, you need to distinguish between needs and wants. The only things that you and your children really need are food, water, a shelter and love. Chances are, anything else is just a ""want"" meant to give you an ego boost. Sure, you need a car to get around and go to work, but do you need two? Do you need a car that costs you that much a month? Do you need a house that costs you that much? This is not mentioned to induce guilt, only to put things in perspective. Imagine if you were to tell your kids: ""Dad has to work so that we can keep our current lifestyle."" They would almost certainly counter with: ""Well, why don't you get rid of your luxury car so we can spend more time together?"" It's all about priorities, and priorities are about perspective. Perspective and priorities then turn what seemed to be a huge sacrifice just a short time ago into a perfect decision, changing more stuff to more important stuff.I was lucky. At age 25 I had a $60K/year job. It was comfortable. We owned a house, my daughter was a year old, and my committed wife was at home with her.It was then that Johanne, my wife, asked me to quit my job and come work at home. I went from ""ARE YOU NUTS?"" to: ""Sure, I'll give my notice tomorrow"" in a matter of an afternoon. I just trusted that it would be great. We look back at that as the turning point of our life. The day our income dropped in half and our promise to our little girl and to the universe started to be fulfilled. I can't take responsibility for it, but I did do my part. Small sacrifices can pay off -- I didn't buy my first car until I was 42. The quality time fallacy So you think you can condense time you have with your kids into one happy, specific time? Sort of like eating all of your veggies in a huge smoothie once a week? Sorry -- it doesn't work that way. There is no such thing as quality time. Sure, a good time is better than a crappy time, but you can only have quality time after you have put in a lot of quantity time. A lot of get-to-know-each-other time. We're grownups, lets just say it like it is.A new day!Awareness dawns on us in the most unexpected ways. Let it. Allow it to guide you. Allow it to show you how to make changes whose impact will reinvigorate your sense of purpose. Parenting is a subconscious part of your life. Many things you do or don't do are for reasons that are buried deep within you. Observe them. Admit you're flawed and be determined to correct but one little thing. One thing that will make you 1% better at being a dad. The appreciation you will get will pave the way for more.The day you had your first child, the purpose of your life was rerouted. Follow it. It just may be the best thing you have ever done.This post was Initially published on inspiyr.com"

I don't know that I would have had it in me to do the same. In a riveting and frightening piece on his blog, Traynor's Eye, which was reprinted yesterday in The Guardian, the Dublin based writer described a three-year-long ordeal in which his family was threatened online. He was taunted with anti-Semitic slurs on Facebook, Twitter and his personal blog. His wife was, too. Eventually the troll began leaving packages at Traynor's home. First, a lunchbox filled with ashes and a note: ""Say hello to your relatives from Auschwitz."" Then, a bouquet of dead flowers with his wife's Twitter name on it, followed by a message to his Twitter account that night: ""You'll get home some day & ur bitches throat will be cut & ur son will be gone.""The police couldn't help, but a friend ""who's basically an IT genius"" could, and the messages were tracked to three different IP addresses in Ireland. Two were public Wi-Fi spots. But the third, Traynor writes ""was a friend's house. The troll was his son. His 17-year-old son."" Yes, I just gave away the ending, but you should still go read the piece, because it is rich with parenting questions. First, there are the ones you might expect for parents of teens -- a reminder that alarm bells should go off when your child can not pry himself from technology. As the father of the troll told Traynor, the teen was ""always glued to his laptop, tablet or smartphone ... He couldn't watch a TV show without tweeting about it simultaneously. [And] he'd become engrossed in conspiracy sites.""Then there are the questions about how to handle the despicable behavior of someone's child. What Traynor chose to do, with the help of the boy's parents, was ""accidentally"" run into the family in a public spot. Over tea and chocolate chip cookies, he told his story to the parents -- complete with a manila envelope full of screenshots and photos that he just happened to have with him -- as if it were just an update about his life, not an accusation against their son. He writes: I showed them pictures of ashes and dead flowers.Traynor could have called the police and had this young man prosecuted. He could have used ""the troll's"" name when writing this story and shamed him publicly and for life. He did neither of those things. Instead, he made some demands of the boy and his parents -- that the son get counseling and never do something like this again. Could you have forgiven that completely? I'm not sure I could have. But I am certain I would be forever grateful to someone if they did the same for my son."
