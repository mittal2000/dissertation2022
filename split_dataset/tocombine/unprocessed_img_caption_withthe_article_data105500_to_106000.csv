0,WORLDPOST,7 Ways Data Currently Being Collected About You Could Hurt Your Career or Personal Life,"Frank Pasquale, ContributorAuthor, The Black Box Society: The Secret Algorithms that Cont...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/data-collected-hurt-career-personal_b_6110682.html,Databases may be defaming you without you even knowing it.,2014-11-06,"This undated photo provided by Facebook shows the server room at the company's data center in Prineville, Ore. The revelations that the National Security Agency is perusing millions of U.S. customer phone records at Verizon and snooping on the digital communications stored by nine major Internet services illustrate how aggressively personal data is being collected and analyzed. (AP Photo/Facebook, Alan Brandt)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc140b22300005000d0c3ee.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Your data is telling a story about you. Maybe the story's a good one: you vote at every election, you pay your bills on time, you do your job well and get to work on time each day. But there are now so many data brokers -- buyers and sellers of data -- that databases may be defaming you without you even knowing it. Consider the following examples: 1) You could get classified as a meth dealer ChoicePoint is a data broker that maintains files on nearly all Americans. It mistakenly reported a criminal charge of ""intent to sell and manufacture methamphetamines"" in an Arkansas resident's file. ChoicePoint corrected the information when notified about the error, but other companies that had bought Taylor's file from ChoicePoint did not automatically follow suit. The free-floating lie ensured rapid rejection of her job applications, and she could not even obtain credit to buy a dishwasher. Some companies corrected their reports in a timely manner, but Taylor had to nag others repeatedly and even took one to court. She found the effort to correct all the meth conviction entries overwhelming. ""I can't be the watchdog all the time,"" she told the Washington Post. It took her four years to find a job, even after the error was uncovered, and she was still rejected for an apartment. Taylor ended up living in her sister's house and says the stress of the wrongful accusation exacerbated her heart problems. As Elizabeth DeArmond has observed, the ""power of mismatched information . . . to disrupt or even paralyze the lives of individuals has grown dramatically."" For every Catherine Taylor -- who became aware of the data defaming her -- there may be thousands of other victims entirely unaware of dubious scarlet letters besmirching their digital dossiers.2) Buy cable ""plus package,"" get classified as plus-sized Health status can be attributed (if not definitively discovered) with reference to records from far outside the medical system. If you're a childless man who shops for clothing online, spends a lot on cable TV and drives a minivan, we know certain data brokers are going to assume you are overweight. Recruiters for obesity drug trials will happily pay for that analysis, and that could lead to some good health outcomes for the people they reach. But how far might the data go?3) Watch out for that coffee cup!  The Presidential Commission for the Study of Bioethical Issues issued a report in 2012 that brought up some of the novel threat scenarios involved in probabilistic analyses of genomic information: In many states, someone could legally pick up a discarded coffee cup and send a saliva sample to a commercial sequencing entity in an attempt to discover an individual's predisposition to neurodegenerative disease. That information might then be misused, for example, by a contentious spouse as evidence of unfitness to parent in a child custody case. Or the information might be publicized by a malicious stranger or acquaintance without the individual's knowledge or consent in a social networking space, which could adversely affect that individual's chance of finding a spouse, achieving standing in a community or pursuing a desired career path.Even more bizarrely, malicious gossips may claim First Amendment protection for spreading such information. As long as it's true, there's very little you can do to stop them.The coffee cup example may seem speculative. But translated to the digital world, it's a business model for many big companies. As Anil Dash has observed: Someone could make off with all your garbage that's put out on the street, and carefully record how many used condoms, pregnancy tests or discarded pill bottles are in the trash, and then post that information up on the web along with your name and your address. There's probably no law against it in your area. Trash on the curb is public. . . . [Online,] the business models of some of the most powerful forces in society are increasingly dependent on our complicity in making our conversations, our creations and our communities public whenever they can exploit them. We now need to consider whether the types of social norms that keep companies from picking up trash bags and analyzing their contents should also apply to our online lives. The ""digital exhaust"" from internet use might be just as embarrassing and largely irrelevant to society as the refuse in our waste baskets. And just as no one should be forced to move to a building with an incinerator to keep their trash private, so too might we want to live in a world where there's no pressure to keep up with the latest in encryption technology to keep one's secrets. 4) A depressing use of pharmacy data Companies are not shy about using and distributing certain information. For those in the individual insurance market, the risk of runaway health data has already been realized. Patients who purchased antidepressants were later denied insurance repeatedly, thanks to a dossier sold to insurers. Consider, for instance, the plight of a Louisiana couple who sought insurance while in their fifties. Paula had taken an antidepressant as a sleep aid and occasionally used a blood pressure medication to relieve some swelling in her ankles. Humana, a large insurer based in Kentucky, refused to insure the couple based on that prescription history. They were not able to find insurance from other carriers, either. No one had explained to them that a few prescriptions could render them uninsurable. Indeed, the model for blackballing them may still have been a gleam in an entrepreneur's eye when Mrs. Shelton obtained her drugs. The Affordable Care Act makes things better now, since health insurers cannot deny coverage for preexisting conditions. But who knows who else is using such data?5) Get tracked by many different sources  One thing is becoming clear with data brokers: it is almost impossible to keep track of where they're getting their data. Consider all the sources that could collect ""health-inflected"" information, such as bills for pills or GPS records of an emergency room visit: And how far data brokers could go to combine and recombine those sources:  Images Credit: Federal Trade CommissionKeeping track of all these uses of data is nearly impossible -- it could turn into a full time job.6) Opportunity -- and peril -- on new social networksSocial networks can now be organized around personal health records. One is PatientsLikeMe, which provides novel and powerful opportunities to address health issues and to form communities, but also opens the door to other data uses. While addressing frequently asked questions, PatientsLikeMe has stated that ""you should expect that every piece of information you submit (even if it is not currently displayed) may be shared with our partners and any member of PatientsLikeMe."" While the company might be relied on to vet partners, its customers may have no idea about how easily information can spread. The Wall Street Journal reported that ""Nielsen Co., [a] media-research firm . . . was 'scraping,' or copying, every single message off PatientsLikeMe's private online forums."" Health attributes connected to usernames (which, in turn, can often be linked to real identities) could have spread into numerous databases. Many are not required to report to any entity on either the origin or destination of their data. 7) Perplexing personality tests In an era of persistently high unemployment, even low-wage cashier and stocking jobs are fiercely competitive. Firms use tests from companies like Kronos, Inc. to determine who would be a good fit for a given job. You may be penalized for only agreeing ""strongly"" rather than ""totally"" in response to this statement: ""All rules must be followed to the letter at all times."" Consider how you might respond to statements like these, given four possible multiple-choice responses: ""strongly disagree, disagree, agree and strongly agree:""• You would like a job that is quiet and predictable • Other people's feelings are their own business • Realistically, some of your projects will never be finished • You feel nervous when there are demands you can't meet • It bothers you when something unexpected disrupts your day • In school, you were one of the best students • In your free time, you go out more than stay homeWhat is the right response for a would-be clerk, manager or barista confronted with these statements, which come from recent tests? It's not readily apparent. Moreover, the tests' authors refuse to release the ""right answers,"" and who knows if they could. Companies like CVS and Circuit City may want different attitudes from different staff. Despite its indeterminacy, the test has important consequences for job seekers. Test takers with a ""green score"" have a decent shot at full interviews; those in the ""red"" or ""yellow"" zone are most likely shut out.A glimmer of hope... Although the new data landscape is scary, it makes sense to use some existing ways of protecting yourself. For example, under HIPAA, you can at least demand to see your medical records. You even have the right to see whom your health providers disclosed them to. Similarly, with FCRA, you can try to assure that your credit records are accurate. And you can order copies of your credit report from annualcreditreport.com. You can find out where other files about you are kept by consulting this site, maintained by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.But even in these areas, it pays to be careful! For example, after federal law required credit bureaus to release a free copy of credit histories to consumers annually, credit bureaus created a number of websites with names like ""freecreditreport.com"" which ultimately charged for the report, or only released it when the requestor bought other services. Forced to establish the site www.annualcreditreport.com to release credit histories, the bureaus ""blocked web links from reputable consumer sites such as Privacy Rights Clearinghouse and Consumers Union, and from mainstream news web sites,"" according to one complaint. Enforcers at the Federal Trade Commission had to intervene, and sued when bureaus made their call centers difficult to reach. Even when data is regulated, it pays to be very careful in how you access it.Unfortunately, most data isn't covered by FCRA or HIPAA. So we're going to need new laws to help rein in the worst abuses of the new data landscape. Data brokers need to document where they get their data from, and to whom they sell it. We deserve the right to access all files kept on us and the right to correct them. Until that happens, the brave new world of runaway data will continue to threaten our reputations, opportunities and livelihoods. "
1,POLITICS,The Way Forward in Ferguson,"Gordon Whitman, ContributorDeputy Director, PICO National Network",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-way-forward-in-ferguson_b_6063164.html,"The way forward on Ferguson are negotiations that bring about fundamental changes in policing, governance and the economy in the St. Louis region, changes that dismantle structures that exclude African-Americans in St. Louis from economic opportunity and entangle in them in a broken criminal justice system.",2014-11-06,"Protesters gather across the street from the Ferguson, Mo., police station in a continuing protest of the shooting of Michael Brown, Friday, Oct. 10, 2014, in Ferguson, Mo. (AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8db2c1f0000250125765f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"For 84 days, young people from St. Louis have put their lives on the line in often late-night standoffs with the police to protest the killing of Michael Brown. Many first met during the hours that Michael lay bleeding on Canfield Drive and the days of protests that followed.   Chanting ""It is our duty to fight for our freedom! It is our duty to win! We must love and support each other! We have nothing to lose but our chains!"" they have stood face-to-face with lines of baton-wielding police officers night-after-night.   They've persisted against tear gas, pepper spray, rubber bullets, having military weapons pointed at them, being hit and kicked by police, and facing efforts by authorities to single out protest leaders for arrest. Instead of crushing the protests, the heavy-handed police response has been a crucible out of which a new generation of young leaders have emerged, and the community they have formed is having reverberations across America.Some in the media have falsely portrayed the protests as violent. The truth is that courageous young people, like Tef Poe and Tory Russel of Hands Up United, Ashley Yates of Millennial Activists United, and Rika Tyler and T-Dubb-O have forged a fierce form of non-violent direct action. It is moving to watch them stand within inches of police and speak the brutal truth about their experience of being black in St. Louis. There is growing concern that a decision not to indict Darren Wilson could lead to a new round of police violence against peaceful protestors. Last week, Tim Fitch, the former St. Louis County police chief, said that illegal leaks about the grand jury process were a way of preparing for ""game day."" What does Fitch mean by game day? How will the police respond to massive protests against a failure to indict? Will they bring back military equipment and heavy weapons? If there is looting and arson, will the police respond by attacking the non-violent youth who are holding the protest lines in Ferguson?St. Louis authorities have spent millions of dollars on equipment and police overtime, but done so little to listen to the community and act on deeply felt greivances. The decision to respond to young protesters with brute force rather than negotiation has only put off the day when St. Louis reckons with the task of creating a region in which everyone counts, has a say and can live free. Dismantling racial injustice in St. Louis    Police brutality sparked the movement in Ferguson. But when young people march under the banner of Black Lives Matter, they are taking on the whole system of racial injustice that structures life in the St. Louis area, and across the country.There is a lot to protest against. The almost entirely white police forces in Ferguson (the city is 70 percent African-American, but 94 percent of its police are white) and across the St. Louis region have a long history of racial profiling and harassment, using excessive force against African-Americans, and resisting civilian oversight. In the weeks after Michael Brown was killed, protesters exposed a bench warrant system that has municipalities like Ferguson raising much of their revenue by stopping and harassing African-American drivers.   While St. Louis is similar to many metropolitan areas in the Midwest in its hyper-segregation in housing, schooling and employment, it is uniquely balkanized by race and class. St. Louis City is separated from St. Louis County, and the county is divided into 97 different municipalities, with the African-American population concentrated in the increasingly segregated North County area. White wealth and privilege in St. Louis rests on generations of racial exclusion and oppression. African-Americans in St. Louis are 2.5 times more likely to be unemployed, a larger racial gap in unemployment than all but three other metro regions. St. Louis County has some of the greatest disparities in public education in the country. In fact, children in Canfield Green, where Michael Brown was killed, don't even attend school in Ferguson -- which is an underfunded but accredited school system. Instead they go to the underfunded and unaccredited Riverview Gardens district, which is 98 percent African-American. What good is the Democratic Party?Fundamentally, the youth leading protests across the region are in a standoff with a calcified white Democratic Party establishment in St. Louis and Missouri. County Prosecutor Robert P. McCulloch has the most direct power to bring about a public trial of Darren Wilson. McCulloch, a Democrat with 23 years in office, has deep ties to the police and a poor track record of holding them accountable for abuse. McCulloch has also been functioning as the political boss in St. Louis County, recently orchestrating the defeat of an incumbent African-American county executive by a white candidate in the August Democratic primary.  The Democratic Party in St. Louis City and County and in Missouri could not maintain its power without the support of African-American voters. Yet Governor Nixon has been largely AWOL on Ferguson, refusing to appoint a special prosecutor or speak out against the abusive police tactics against non-violent demonstrations. This month he announced a commission to look at the underlying issues of inequality that have been raised by protesters. The significance of this commission is still an open question. One telling illustration of the disconnect between the Democratic Party in the state and the African-American community: Since Michael Brown was killed, the Missouri Democratic Party has contributed $267,634 to the State Senate campaign of State Representative Jeff Roorda, a man who headed up fundraising efforts for Darren Wilson. Roorda was fired from the Arnold, Missouri, police force for making false statements. He is now the executive director of the St. Louis Police Officers Association. In the legislature he has led efforts to oppose the use of on-body cameras and introduced legislation last year that would have prevented the public from seeing any records related to police shootings if they contain the name of the officer who did the shooting. How does a huge investment of resources into a politician with Roorda's track record and positions square with a commitment to racial justice?The way forward   With the grand jury supposedly still at work, the media have been filled with one-sided leaks that represents a shameful effort by prosecutors and police to manipulate public opinion. The Justice Department has called it inappropriate and troubling.It is unusual for a prosecutor to bring a murder case before a grand jury without a recommendation to file charges, which is what McCulloch did. And it is uncommon for people under investigation to testify, yet that is what Darren Wilson did. It seems clearer every day that McCulloch is using the secret grand jury process to deflect political responsibility for not prosecuting Wilson and to try to wait out the protests.   That is wishful thinking on his part.   The only real solution to the stand-off in Ferguson is a public trial of Darren Wilson where we can all hear the testimony of witnesses about what happened on August 9, and serious negotiation with the young people leading the protests. The way forward on Ferguson are negotiations that bring about fundamental changes in policing, governance and the economy in the St. Louis region, changes that dismantle structures that exclude African-Americans in St. Louis from economic opportunity and entangle in them in a broken criminal justice system. The list of desperately needed changes is long and includes new police leadership in St. Louis County; an end to the bench warrant system as a municipal revenue strategy; consistent approaches across the metro region to policing that are based on best practices from communities that have brought down high levels of police abuse and gun violence; a serious jobs program; and state criminal justice reform that invests in jobs and education over criminalization and incarceration.   Change is coming. Young people are leading it. The rest of us must follow them even if the way forward is uncomfortable. The time to start delivering on justice is now."
2,GREEN,The End of the Big Oil and Gas Game Has Come,"Woodrow Clark, ContributorEconomist for environment and renewable energy",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/oil-and-ga-game-ends_b_6061194.html,"When the world's major financial institutions start to do serious, accurate, research science and measure the declining costs of renewable energy verse the rising costs of fossil fuels, it becomes easier to understand the monumental impact that the Green Industrial Revolution is having.",2014-11-06,Natural gas fired turbine power plant with it's cooling towers rising into a blue sky,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb160272200003501db4a6a.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Co-authored with Grant CookeSheikh Ahmed-Zaki Yamani said in 2000, ""The Stone Age came to an end, not because we had a lack of stones, and the oil age will come to an end not because we have a lack of oil."" The former Saudi oil minister was arguably the world's foremost expert on the oil industry at that time. However, then he introduced this extraordinary observation in the UK's Telegraph, which was an even more prescient point about how, ""Thirty years from now there will be a huge amount of oil -- and no buyers. Oil will be left in the ground."" A decade and half later and we are coming to the end of Big Oil. Yet not as others have predicted, such as Mark Stansberry, in his book America needs America's Energy (2012), which reviews how natural gas has risen to be the foremost energy source in the USA and is now being sold to other countries around the world. Stansberry, whom Clark knows very well due to their working together on shared issues such as: the need for a ""national energy plan""; the move off of ""coal and oil dependency""; and therefore the ""control and [reduction of] carbon and greenhouse gases."" However, Stansberry, like his mentor, Robert Hefner III, saw natural gas as the ""Major Bridge"" as the energy source before wind, solar and a new ""hydrogen-based economy."" The problem is when conventional energy sources are discovered, produced, distributed and become economical, they are not a bridge or as every natural gas advocate states today, the ""transition"" to renewable energy sources. Unless ""transition"" is defined and then based upon a ROI or business model for 3-5 years. The definition of transition is a myth (and a false representation) in terms of the number of years and time in which natural gas will be the predominate source of energy in the USA, and around the world. However, with natural gas, as with other fossil fuels, such a short time frame can never happen. All fossil fuels need, due to their conventional economic models, to be in place for 3-4 decades at the minimum to cover the loans, investments and profits that the company owners want. That is why oil and coal have been the energy supply sources of all global economic growth for over a century.Why?The bridge or transition is based in conventional classical economics. The need to borrow funds and satisfy investors means that the entire discovery of natural gas to its final consumer, must return a solid, dependable and long-term profit. There is no transition period of time, unless defined as decades. Government support of all fossil fuels follows the same line of reasoning and economic models. Historically, and even now with natural gas pipelines, processing rules and shipping, the national and local governments become ""partners"" in this ""transition."" Hence not only are their debates, which are monetized into financial ""tax breaks and deductions"" for these companies, but also there is the subversion of environmental laws, ignoring health costs on personal and community levels.The natural gas industry claims to be able to make America ""energy independent."" Again another false and devious use of language. Many of us involved in supporting and getting public along with private sector support for renewable energy, were calling it the pathway to make America ""energy independent"" of other nations and no longer in need of oil, coal and gas. The wind, sun and water sources for energy were virtually free and obtainable without massive drilling, transit, shipping or pipelines. For example, fracking and shale oil from land are destroying land and water in the USA. On-site power to people in their homes and businesses is far more ""independent"" and doable than any these fossil fuels. Nonetheless the historical domination of the world's geopolitics, business and economics by the fossil fuel interests over the past century have now taken a new and even more environmentally costly strategy that will make the USA dependent upon THEIR fossil fuel sources for energy over another 50-100 years. A new era of energy generation, storage and sharing is upon us, known as The Green Industrial Revolution (GIR), the title of our new book. This GIR has emerged as the next significant political, social and economic era in world history. It has already taken hold, in parts of EU and Asia, and will result in a complete restructuring of the way energy is generated, supplied, and used. It is a revolutionary time of extraordinary potential and opportunity, with remarkable innovations in science and energy that will lead to sustainable, smart and carbonless economies powered by nonpolluting technologies that are integrated with one another like wind, geothermal, wave, river and solar along with their storage and back up devices. These resources along with advanced environmental technologies like flywheels, regenerative and maglev systems as well as hydrogen fuel cells. Many factors are coming together to hasten this Green Industrial Revolution. Vladimir Putin's annexation of the Crimean and eastern Ukraine has shocked Europe and the rest of the world. On a good side, it has made nations and communities around the world aware of how countries that control energy sources like oil and gas can control vast regions of the world. Thus the Putin advances on countries, like the Ukraine which is NOT the only nation near and dependent upon Russia, has stirred the region's efforts to generate more renewable energy in order to become independent of Russia's fossil fuels. The same scenario is exactly what got the USA involved in the Middle East when President George Bush ordered American troops to Kuwait in 1991. Unlike his son, he also stopped that war since the goal was to free Kuwait from terrorists. The war in the middle-east now has been over a decade and now spreading. The terrorists in the middle-east get their money from the regional oil and gas industries. If the USA and other nations stopped buying their oil and gas, there would be no need for war. Nor would there be terrorists.Perhaps the clearest, most reasoned analysis of the US oil and gas industry tax subsidies and the potential benefit of removing them came from Alan Krueger, the chief economist and assistant secretary for economic policy at the US Department of Treasury in 2009. In testimony to Congress he explained that the ""current US tax law provided several credits and deductions specific to the oil and gas industry."" Hence the Administration recommended:Eliminating these tax preferences would raise revenues about $10.3 billion from 2010 to 2019. The administration also proposed to repeal three tax preferences available for integrated and nonintegrated firms. Elimination of these would result in about $20.3 billion from 2010 to 2019 (Krueger, 2009).Krueger gave a long list of other economic related issues that would be supported by such a change in policy. Yet the report and data were rejected by the Republican controlled Congress and their fossil fuel industry supporters. There is no need to list names. They are always the same and well known. The answer by the Republicans was instead to have an additional $2.3 billion in annual tax cuts to the oil companies.Today three key factors will stop the fossil fuel industry and make the Sheikh Yamani's prediction come true for all fossil fuels. 1) Carbon Emitters Made to Pay The first is that the carbon emitters will be held accountable and made to pay for using the atmosphere as a garbage can. While still struggling to price the cost of pollution, most nations have come to realize that the heavy carbon emitters need to pay for the damage that they have done. A cap-and-trade (C&T) process has risen from the government bureaucracies supported and advanced by Wall Street financial interests as the first method to hold the carbon emitters accountable. However, the C&T is not nearly as effective as a straight carbon tax that collects money and then allocates it. While politicians and the public do not like the word ""tax"" some of us prefer to all it an ""incentive"" program much like the successful non-cigarette smoking program that started in California and now has spread around the world. The cigarette tax become known as an ""incentive"" so that political leaders would not be accused of advancing a new tax. As the extra few cents paid for a pack of cigarettes, such an incentive along with the restrictions on smoking due to the health dangers of smoking to individuals and those near-by (e.g. second hand smoking) will control, decrease and finally replace fossil fuels. This ""incentive"" system is not seen or used as a tax, but as means to raise funds to research, develop programs and implement plans to stop smoking. Now it has grown and spread throughout the world. The European Union's program, which started several years ago, is now deemed a success. The C&T program failed there while the smoking incentive has become an established part of European culture and corporate practice. Various nations such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Korea and China have looked into cap-and-trade programs but are leaning now much more to a Carbon Tax (Incentive) program. The pressure to make the major carbon emitters pay for their pollution is coming from the agreements made at the 2012 UN Conference on Climate Change in Doha, Qatar. At this conference world governments consolidated the gains of the last three years of international climate change negotiations and opened a gateway to greater ambition and action. Among the decisions was to concentrate on a universal climate agreement by 2015, which will come into effect in 2020. The 2015 UN Climate Conference will be held in Paris, and world governments are expecting much greater cooperation and agreement for carbon-reduction policies from the U.S.A and other major emitters, including China which ranks number #1 in the world, passing the U.S.A.2) Grid ParityThe second major factor hastening the end of today's megalithic fossil fuel industries is ""grid parity,"" which is a technical term meaning that the cost to a consumer for electricity from a renewable source (without subsidies) is about equal to the cost from a traditional source -- be it fossil fuel or nuclear. The Germans used grid parity to price their feed-in-tariff, or FiT program that launched Energiewende. In short, grid parity puts renewable energy sources on the same exact price as conventional fossil fuels and nuclear are today. It is important to keep in mind that historically when oil and gas (and more recently nuclear) energy came into use for consumers (grid or energy system suppliers), the costs had been high and needed to be leveled or lowered (parity) in order for users to pay for them. The cost of conventional energy from traditional sources is rising, driven by higher extracting costs, additional externalities (such as legal and insurance costs due to supply system accidents), increased maintenance costs for natural gas pipelines and increased operating costs at nuclear power plants. Due to the tsuanmi in Fukishima, the shut down of nuclear power plants is occurring all around the world. To keep them operating and securing means extremely high and almost unpredictable add-on costs. At the same time the costs for renewable energy -- wind, solar photovoltaic, and bio-waste fuels, wave, ocean and hydro power are declining.For example, the costs for wind generation have been for almost a decade and still are, the lowest. Solar costs are declining rapidly as use spreads not just to power utilities but to home owners, shopping malls and office buildings as well as government, schools and colleges. Deutsche Bank reported in January 2014 that there were 19 regions around the world where unsubsidized PV solar power costs were competitive with other forms of generation. This equality of costs with fossil fuel and natural gas is creating a worldwide solar boom in 2014-2015.Germany with its FiT program for grid parity started this economic process that lowered the costs for solar. Now, other nations have enacted similar FiT programs with funding and resources supporting them. China now leads the world in the production and sale of wind and solar systems. Solar PV technology, which has been helped by the USA military, is improving so fast that it has achieved a virtuous circle. As described by New York's Sanford and Bernstein Investment Bank, the world has entered an era of ""global energy deflation."" This ratcheting down of energy costs may be slow to start, but they argue that the fossil fuel dominated energy market will experience a major decline in costs over the next decade. The market is entering a new order that will erode the viability of oil, gas and the fossil fuel continuum. In April 2014, the highly respected Paris-based financial company Kepler Chevreux released a research report that has rippled through the fossil fuel industries. Kepler Chevreux described what is at stake for the fossil fuel industry as the world governments' push for green fuels and reduced GHG emissions gathers momentum. The firm argues that the global oil, gas and coal industries are set to lose a combined $28 trillion in revenues over the next two decades as governments take action to address climate change, reverse green house gases (GHG), clean up pollution and move to de-carbonize the global energy system. The report helps to explain the enormous pressure that the industries are exerting on governments not to regulate GHGs. The report said oil industry revenues could fall by $19.3 trillion over the period 2013-2035, coal industry revenues could fall by $4.9 trillion and gas revenues could be $4 trillion lower. High production cost extraction such as deep-water wells, oil sands, and shale oil will be most affected. Recent monitoring of the global stock exchanges mirror these conclusions. The fossil fuel industry, when the true costs of their products are known, is facing a major collapse -- as it should. And as it leaders are well aware of since they are targeting and attacking those who provide this evidence: the fossil fuel industrial is not even close to providing the U.S.A. or other countries the ability to be ""energy independent."" The facts and economics are just the opposite. Sooner than later, fossil fuel assets will be too expensive to extract, and like Sheikh Yammi said, the oil, now natural gas and soon uranium, will be left in the ground. The cost savings in terms of every aspect from drilling to delivery will be saved, climate and pollution reduced and human health costs saved.Kepler Chevreux's report is consistent with others released in 2014. One report from U.S.A.'s CitiGroup was titled ""Age of Renewables is Beginning -- A Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE)."" Released in March 2014, the report argues that there will be significant price decreases in solar and wind power, which will add to the renewable energy generation boom. CitiGroup projects price declines based on Moore's Law, the same dynamic that drove the boom in information technology. In short, CitiGroup is looking for cost reductions of as much as 11 percent per year in all phases of PV development and installation. When the world's major financial institutions start to do serious, accurate, research science and measure the declining costs of renewable energy verse the rising costs of fossil fuels, it becomes easier to understand the monumental impact that the Green Industrial Revolution is having.3) Zero Marginal Cost  We have come to the last leg of our triad, ""Zero Marginal Cost."" Marginal cost, to an economist or businessperson, is the cost of producing one more unit of a good or service after fixed costs have been paid. Companies have used technology to increase the productivity, reduce marginal costs and increase profits from the beginning. However, as Jeremy Rifkin points out in Zero Marginal Cost Society, we have entered an era where technology has unleashed ""extreme productivity,"" driving marginal costs on some items and services to near zero. File sharing technology and subsequent zero marginal cost almost ruined the record business and shook the movie business. The newspaper and magazine industries have been pushed to the wall and are being replaced by the blogosphere and YouTube. The book industry struggles with the e-book phenomenon. A powerful technology revolution is evolving that will change all aspects of our lives, including how we access renewable energy. An energy Internet is coming that will seamlessly tie together how we share and interact with electricity. It will greatly increase productivity and drive marginal cost of producing and distributing electricity down, possibly to nothing beyond our fixed costs. This is almost the case with the early adopters of solar and wind energy. As they pay off these systems and their fixed costs are covered, additional units of energy are basically free. This is the concept that Ikea, the Swedish furniture manufacturer, is exploiting. Ikea is test marketing residential solar systems in Europe that cost about $11,000 with a payback of 3-5 years. Eventually, we'll be able to buy a home solar system at Ikea, Costco or Home Depot, have it installed and recover our costs in less than two years. All three of these elements -- carbon mitigation costs, grid parity and zero marginal costs, (and others like additive manufacturing and nanotechnology) are seen in the spreading of the Green Industrial Revolution. It will be an era of momentous change in the way we live our lives and it will mean the passing of the carbon-intensive industries. Like the centralized utility industry, the fossil fuel industry and the large centralized utilities have business models predicated on continued growth in consumption. Once that integration and hence nexus of declining prices for renewables and rising costs of extraction with distribution are crossed, the demand will rapidly shift and propel us into ""global energy deflation."" There are many regions and nations around the world where this has already started."
3,POLITICS,The Perils of Conflating ISIS and Al Qaeda,"Samuel Ramani, ContributorDPhil Candidate, University of Oxford",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/the-perils-of-conflating-_b_6042930.html,The diffusion risk and unprecedented economic and military capabilities ISIS possesses should compel US policymakers to devise a new approach to combat the threat it poses.,2014-11-06,"KHAZAIR, IRAQ - JUNE 26: Iraqis walk to register at a displacement camp for families caught-up in the fighting in and around the city of Mosul on June 26, 2014 in Khazair, Iraq. Khazair is now home to an estimated 1,500 internally displaced persons (IDP's) with the number rising daily. Tens of thousands of people have fled Iraq's second largest city of Mosul after it was overrun by ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) militants. Many have been temporarily housed at various IDP camps around the region including the area close to Erbil, as they hope to enter the safety of the nearby Kurdish region. (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dae1240000300098f75f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since the inception of ISIS's campaign of terror in Syria and Iraq, many Western policymakers have assumed that ISIS employs similar strategies to and harbors ambitions akin to those of al-Qaeda. Barack Obama recently declared that al-Qaeda and ISIS are ""one and the same,"" a statement that hearkened back to the erroneous linkage promoted by the Bush administration between Saddam Hussein and the 9/11 attacks. The tendency of the Obama administration to conflate the threats posed by ISIS and al-Qaeda is further evidenced by his claim that anti-al-Qaeda operations in Yemen and Somalia provide a model for the US to follow in its efforts to defeat ISIS.Obama's Yemen and Somalia parallel immediately drew the ire of Republicans and US foreign policy critics alike because of the continued prevalence of Islamic extremism and woefully inadequate political institutions in both countries. Yet many of these critics still subscribe to the prevailing opinion that the anti-ISIS campaign is just the latest phase of the War on Terror and that ISIS's primary antagonist is the West.Constant anti-Western proclamations from ISIS's leaders and the beheadings of British and American citizens appear to confirm this opinion, and suggest that ISIS is merely a wealthier and more powerful incarnation of al-Qaeda, However, I believe this assessment is premised on a perilous misconception that overemphasizes rhetorical similarities between both organizations. Indeed, it is frequently overlooked that unlike al-Qaeda, ISIS's main short-term enemies are rival jihadists not the West. While al-Qaeda funded Boko Haram and occasionally transcended sectarian lines by aligning with Shiite terror group Hezbollah, ISIS has engaged in open belligerence towards rival terrorist organizations. Al-Qaeda severed its relationship with ISIS in February 2014 and ISIS has described Hamas as heretics who need to be destroyed in order for Palestinians to effectively confront Israel. ISIS also possesses a much more centralized command structure than al-Qaeda, which, has caused it to envelop rather than cooperate with rival jihadists. The recent alliance between Syria's Al Nusra Front (an al-Qaeda-affiliated organization) and ISIS reveals that ISIS's military capabilities are a more effective carrot to entice allies than its brand of radical Islamist ideology. Submission by the sword is the means that drives ISIS's expansion.ISIS's strategy of enveloping terrorist groups increases the likelihood of its operations spreading to other countries in the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, as it will seek to supplant rather than tolerate the existence of jihadist organizations with divergent views. The diffusion risk and unprecedented economic and military capabilities ISIS possesses should compel US policymakers to devise a new approach to combat the threat it poses. The differences between al-Qaeda and ISIS indicate that precedents for the anti-ISIS campaign should not be derived from anti-al-Qaeda efforts. Instead, since combatting ISIS requires a synthesis of containment and rollback (removing ISIS from territories it occupies), many lessons can be derived from America's confrontation against communist movements during the Cold War. Like ISIS, Marxist guerilla organizations were most successful in countries like Vietnam and Angola, which possessed fragile political institutions or were ruled by despotic regimes. Additionally, factional rivalries between Communist organizations often caused Chinese proxies to develop in countries where Soviet proxies were strong (or vice versa), which increased the likelihood of communist diffusion. The ISIS-al-Qaeda internal conflict is triggering a similar kind of reciprocal escalation, as evidenced by the emergence of al-Qaeda proxy Khorasan to combat ISIS's growing influence in Syria. As ISIS's financial coffers continue to swell and its hold on territory in Iraq and Syria consolidates, it is conceivable that ISIS could create proxies in Yemen, Mali and Somalia with the intention of enveloping al-Qaeda and al-Shabaab. The emergence of a ISIS foothold in Jordan, (which is a relatively stable state notwithstanding localized turmoil stemming from the influx of Syrian refugees), further highlights the prospect of ISIS diffusing in a similar manner to communism in the Third World.While US policymakers remain alarmingly unprepared to combat a potential ISIS contagion, the US could at least partially mitigate the diffusion risk by considering lessons derived from Cold War containment policies. Firstly, the US needs to expand the scope of multilateral engagement to combat ISIS. Much like NATO and the Baghdad Pact operated as effective bulwarks against communism, the United States needs to closely engage with the Arab League to devise a common anti-ISIS strategy that provides for the collective security of all Middle East states. Collaboration with ISIS in any form should be severely disincentivized, and the Arab League should strictly punish direct violations (state funding of ISIS) or indirect violations (lack of enforcement of private donations to ISIS). Building a consensus around the financial isolation of ISIS is achievable as ISIS poses an existential threat to many Middle Eastern states. If the Arab League takes the initiative in cracking down on ISIS donations from actors within their borders, the anti-ISIS campaign will have much more legitimacy in the eyes of the Arab public than a set of Western-imposed sanctions. Secondly, America must eschew the tempting argument that its overwhelming air power alone can single-handedly vanquish ISIS. Considering the abject failure of air power to guide the US to victory in Vietnam during the 1960s and state consolidation crises in Iraq and Libya that are in part attributable to inadequate policing by international forces after a successful regime change, American policymaker's myopically positive view of air power is surprising. Vietnam also nakedly exposed the perils of America's chronic underestimation of non-great power opposition. Guerilla forces displayed remarkable tactical flexibility by escalating their MiG campaign in 1967 precisely in tandem with the escalation of US aerial bombardments. The prospect of US air power emboldening ISIS to test American resolve and to adhere to the assumption that the US will back down if the casualties escalate to an unacceptably high level, is a frightening prospect inadequately addressed by current military strategies.While I do not advocate the widespread use of ground troops to supplant the current US air power-driven policy, I believe the United States must express greater caution in categorically ruling out a ground troop presence in a particular conflict zone. Ground troops are most effective where they can coordinate with unambiguously anti-ISIS actor. Therefore, America should resist the temptation of employing ground troops in Syria in the short-to-medium-term, but consider placing boots on the ground in Iraq, where relatively credible partnerships can be forged with the national army and Kurdish Peshmerga.The success or failure of American anti-ISIS strategies will ultimately depend on the willingness of US policymakers to recognize ISIS as a threat wholly independent and distinct from that of al-Qaeda. Unfortunately, given the dysfunction in Congress and with midterm elections, it is probable that US policymakers will continue to use tried and tested counter-terrorism strategies and prioritize short-term political expediency over the development of a grand strategy that can durably vanquish the ISIS threat."
4,ENTERTAINMENT,My Conversation With Alan Alda,"Cathy Chester, ContributorAward-winning blogger at ""An Empowered Spirit""",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/my-conversation-with-alan_1_b_6095988.html,"Alan Alda has always been like a cauldron packed tight with ingredients of passion, ideas and deep thought that would burst wide open if he couldn't keep moving forward. Although our conversation lasted only a few minutes it will leave an indelible impression on my heart.",2014-11-06,2014-11-03-AlanAldaNJPACNJSpeakerSeriesScreenandSign.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-11-03-AlanAldaNJPACNJSpeakerSeriesScreenandSign-thumb.jpg,"It would be easy to write about Alan Alda by only recounting stories that everyone already knows, such as his tremendous successes in television, movies and theatre. I could also discuss his well-known talents as a gifted writer of books and screenplays, or his lifelong passion of science that led him to not only host PBS's ""Scientific American Frontiers"" for 14 years but to challenge young minds and inspire the creation of The Center for Communicating Science at Stony Brook University.But Alan Alda is much more than that, and writing about only those achievements, as incredible as they are, would be a disservice to him. He has always been like a cauldron packed tight with ingredients of passion, ideas and deep thought that would burst wide open if he couldn't keep moving forward.As I listened to him speaking recently at The New Jersey Speaker Series it occurred to me how Zenlike Mr. Alda is. He sees his life experiences with great clarity and, after examining them like a true scientist, he challenges and questions himself, then draws his own conclusions.I can best illustrate the Zen of Alan Alda by using three stories from his words and life experiences.Story One: There was one night that forever changed his life, and he uses that near tragedy to contemplate how he became the man he is today.""I'd like to tell you about a night that changed my life. I was up on top of a mountain in Chile, in an observatory because I was with astronomers doing a science show, and I got this tickle in my gut, and within a few minutes it was the worst pain I had ever felt in my life. They had a medic up there. I don't think he'd done anything medical before. I'm all doubled up and he comes over and says, 'How are you?'""They had an ambulance, a big old boxy thing. It looked like the ambulances we had on M*A*S*H. They slide me into the ambulance and I'm groaning and screaming and they take me for an hour and a half down this rocky mountain down to this little town to a hospital with a dimly lit ER.""But there was this brilliant doctor there that night who was an expert in what was wrong with me. It turned out I had a bit of my intestine that lost its blood supply and if it burst a couple hours later I'd be dead. But he knew exactly what the problem was and he figured it out in a few minutes. He leaned into me to tell me they have to cut out part of the bad intestine and sew two good ends together.""And I said, 'Oh, you're going to do an end-to-end anastomosis?' He said, 'How do you know that?"" and I said, 'Oh I did many of those on M*A*S*H.'""And I lived.""And when it was over I felt I'd been given a whole new life. The world was so fresh, the colors were so free, just the feeling of being alive. I wasn't supposed to eat anything solid, and the first piece of cheese I had was the most delicious meal I'd had in my life. I was like a newborn baby tasting everything fresh.""So I thought I don't want this to end. I've met people who had near death experiences and they kept that feeling for a while but then it went away. I didn't want it to go away. How can I make this last?""Maybe if I think about how I got to be how I am, and who I am, and the lessons I've learned, maybe there's something in that. So I started making notes about my earliest childhood memories.""Story Two: When Mr. Alda was seven years old he contracted polio, a horrible deadly disease and an epidemic among children at that time. He remembers his father administering painful treatments that included placing hot woolen blankets on his limbs and painful massages on his muscles.While recovering, Robert Alda brought home a beautiful black cocker spaniel to cheer up his son. The dog was so sweet and loving that they immediately fell in love with each other. When the puppy tragically died his father, in a loving but perhaps misguided effort, had the dog stuffed for posterity so Alan would ""always have him."" But the dog had a ""hideous expression with glass eyes that followed you wherever you walked"" and after placing it next to the fireplace, ""when guests entered the room they'd stop dead.""""I realized years later that this was a tremendous lesson for me. You can't have your dog stuffed. I know that sounds trivial but it's true. You love the dog, he goes away, and you move on. The stuffed dog is a counterfeit; a hollow imitation.""Story Three: Someone from the audience asked what he thought Hawkeye Pierce would be doing today. Alda answered that he never thought about it. As much as he loved the character and was proud of the part he played in creating eleven seasons of M*A*S*H, when it was over, it was over. And he moved on.Beyond the Zen of Alan Alda is the love everyone feels for him. I have never met anyone with an unkind word about him.As a devoted fan I've written about him before. About my schoolgirl crush that turned into deep respect for a man completely devoted to his family and friends, one who always seemed genuine and self-effacing whenever I'd hear him speak.I was more than thrilled when my husband and I were invited to attend a post-event cocktail party to meet Alan Alda in person. I was admittedly a bit nervous. I've met celebrities before, but for me this was different.I didn't want to sound like a gushing teenager or a typical fan. Aside from owning all 11 seasons of M*A*S*H, seeing him on Broadway in Art, QED and Glengarry Glen Ross and enjoying him on film from The Paper Lion through The Aviator, I wanted him to know how important the work he is doing at Stony Book University is to me and the disability community. So I practiced my elevator speech. Several times. Okay, more than several.When it came time for us to meet him one-on-one, my instincts were right. It was as if my husband and I were alone in the room with a dear friend. He listened intently as I thanked him not only for his funny and fascinating talk, but also for the contributions he's making at Stony Book, and what that work will mean to the future of medicine.He smiled and thanked me, then briefly discussed the importance of the work going on at Stony Brook. In the words of my grandmother, he was a real mensch. Although our conversation lasted only a few minutes it will leave an indelible impression on my heart.END NOTE: I also introduced myself to Arlene Alda, who is an accomplished musician, photographer and writer. Her latest book ""Just Kids from the Bronx"" is an oral history about what it was like growing up in the Bronx, a place that ""bred the influencers in just about every field of endeavor today."" It will be coming out March 2015. I wanted to tell Mrs. Alda how excited my Bronx born mother is about reading her upcoming book. Mrs. Alda was lovely, and it was a pleasure to briefly speak with her.The New Jersey Speaker Series is an inaugural series of talks produced by Fairleigh Dickinson University.

Innovation is a determinant of competitive advantage and commercial success, and a driver of economic growth and prosperity. And yet, while observers can offer any number of definitions and connotations, actually identifying and quantifying innovation is a more complicated business. For the past three years, the IP & Science business of Thomson Reuters, drawing on its unique store of patent data, has presented the ""Top 100 Global Innovators"" -- companies which, to a measurable extent, have distinguished themselves by turning creativity and originality into tangible assets. The fourth annual Top 100 listing, new for 2014, has been announced.To select the Top 100 Global Innovators, Thomson Reuters consults its suite of tools for monitoring patenting and intellectual-property activity: Derwent World Patents Index, Derwent Patents Citation Index, Quadrilateral Patent Index, and Thomson Innovation. With these resources, companies are evaluated according to a range of criteria, including the volume of patent applications for new and unique inventions, as opposed to variations on existing patents; success rate at winning patent protection; the extent of securing protection in major world markets; and the influence of their patents as documented by subsequent citation by other companies. The new 2014 roster offers a few striking changes from years past, reflecting the shifting global balance of innovation and commerce. Asia declares a new primacy on the list, particularly with Japanese firms and, perhaps most notable of all, the first China-based company to make the annual ranking. Concurrently, some traditional powers, including the United States and France, have ceded representation among the Top 100. Along with listing the companies, the Thomson Reuters report presents breakdowns by nation and region, as well as the industries represented. In the latter section, semiconductor and electronic components is the most prolific sector, followed by the the related field of computer hardware. Among other shifts since last year's list, institutions devoted to scientific research increased their presence, while automotive firms were fewer. Collectively, the Top 100 constitute an economically formidable group: Their revenue growth outperformed that of the S&P 500 by nearly 100 percent, suggesting the benefits of R&D spending that outstripped not only the S&P 500 but also the NASDAQ. In all, the Top 100 Global Innovators demonstrate the benefits of encouraging and actively supporting innovation, and of investing in the protection of intellectual property. Their distinction in the Thomson Reuters report, and in the marketplace, has been well earned.

8,POLITICS,Unleashing the Democratic Tsunami in 2016,"Mike Lux, ContributorPresident at Mike Lux Media",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/unleashing-the-democratic_b_6117240.html,We can't go into the 2016 cycle thinking that Republican arrogance and demographics alone will save us.

Obama is campaigning for Democrats ahead of the November 4 midterm elections. AFP PHOTO / Saul LOEB (Photo credit should read SAUL LOEB/AFP/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dc6a2100002501c96748.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Since I have been involved in politics as a full-time job, there have been five times where I had a really bad election night, where the Republicans kicked our ass and won most of the important races: 1980, 1994, 2004, 2010, and of course this year. Every single time was awful. Every single time the country suffered a great deal as a result. But every single time, Democrats came storming back the very next election and had a great year. It's not too surprising, really: Republicans are an arrogant bunch with really bad and unpopular policy ideas that don't work out well when they are enacted. And of course, we know that the voting pool in a presidential year tends to look more like the actual population of the country -- younger, more people of color, more unmarried voters -- and that is a very good thing for Democrats. So while I take absolutely nothing for granted, and know that we will have to work our collective Democratic asses off, I go into 2016 with some confidence.  The key, though, is good strategic thinking. We can't go into the 2016 cycle thinking that Republican arrogance and demographics alone will save us. We have to have a strategy that simultaneously fires up our base and appeals to middle- and working-class swing voters. Central to that strategy is picking the right fights to have and to drive with an extended grassroots and media campaign, and avoiding the stupid ""bipartisan"" deals the DC establishment tends to love, but that are harmful to poor and middle income folks. Some examples of both the good ideas and the dumb stuff below.  In 1981, Reagan had swept into power with a Republican Senate, and although the Democrats still controlled the House, there was a sizable enough Southern conservative Democratic faction in the House that Reagan was able to push through his massive supply-side tax cuts for the rich. The Democratic Speaker of the House, Tip O'Neill, knew he was going to lose on the budget battle, but he made a point of picking a big fight on it and driving a message about the Democrats standing with the working class and the Republicans standing with the wealthy. When the budget deal resulted in a recession and a massive deficit in 1982, people remembered O'Neill's stand, and the Democrats picked up 26 House seats that year, securing his ability to control the House the rest of the Reagan years.  In 1993-94, when Democrats had control of Congress, Clinton split the Democratic base and ticked off a lot of working-class swing voters by pushing NAFTA hard. He then failed to get health care reform passed; leaving a lot of Democrats completely unenthused about turning out. But in 1995, after the slaughter of the 1994 elections, when Clinton (at the strong urging of the labor and progressive movements, and against the advice of centrist advisers like Mark Penn) picked a big fight with the Republicans in Congress on the budget over Medicare, Medicaid, Education, and the Environment, the tide turned for Clinton permanently. Clinton went into that fight behind Dole in the polls by about 10 points, and by the time it was done, he was ahead by about 10 -- and he never lost that lead.  After the 2004 elections, with conservative Republicans firmly in control of every branch of government, Democrats, backed strongly by the entire progressive movement, stood their ground and picked big fights with Bush and Tom DeLay over Social Security privatization, the Iraq war, the handling of Katrina, and the fact that Republican leadership was trying to cover up a growing wave of scandal involving sleazy lobbyists like Jack Abramoff. In each of these fights, progressives put campaigns together, gave them enough resources to give them a punch, and worked closely with the Democratic leadership to hold Democrats solidly together on those issues. The result was the most sweeping Democratic midterm election victory of the modern era, a 31 House seat and six Senate seat pick-up.   After the Republican blowout of 2010, Obama's initial reaction was to reach out to cut deals with Republicans on the budget. He agreed to a couple of deals, making massive cuts in spending with no corresponding tax increases, and proposed (but thankfully did not get) a ""grand bargain"" with Republicans that would have cut Social Security benefits and made other big cuts in domestic spending. The progressive community was in open rebellion, Obama looked weak and like he didn't care about fighting for his principles, and his approval ratings hit a first term low. But he saved himself in time with a strong populist speech in the fall of 2011 in Osawatomie, Kansas, that picked fights with the Republicans on a series of economic issues, and then he put out a progressive budget package that stood in stark contrast with the Ryan budget, which progressives had been fighting an on-going campaign to bring down. And Obama's campaign successfully painted Romney as a heartless Wall Street CEO. In the worst economy for a President to be re-elected in since 1936, the Democrats won every closely contested presidential state but one, as well as most of the close Senate races.  The lessons here are clear: pick economic fights about helping poor and middle-class people instead of the wealthy and powerful, and avoid dumb bipartisan trade or budget deals that end jobs and cut benefits for the middle class.  And guess what? Speaking of populism, in the 2014 elections, one key point that people should think about isn't just how Democrats lost, but where we won relatively easily in races that were supposed to be competitive. In Minnesota and Oregon, Democratic Senators Franken and Merkley went into the cycle with people thinking they might be in trouble. In Michigan, the Koch brothers invested a huge amount of money in a race that was supposed to be extremely competitive when Sen. Levin retired. In all three swing states, Democrats followed the same playbook: they ran an unapologetic economically populist campaign; brought in Elizabeth Warren in early to rally the troops and get activists excited to help them; and campaigned as proud progressive Democrats. On a night when most other Democrats struggled, these three strong progressives never went on defense, never struggled, and won the day strongly. Furthermore, of the ten closest Senate races in the country that had been considered the most competitive throughout the cycle (AK, NH, AR, KY, GA, KY, CO, IA, LA, NC), we won only one, Jeanne Shaheen in NH. Shaheen used Warren's populist playbook (and repeated visits to NH to rally the troops) to beat corporate ""moderate"" Scott Brown.  I will close on this extremely important note: While the path to a solid Democratic victory in 2016 is clear, we need to be working toward a Democratic wave not just a Democratic victory. With the gains the Republicans made in the House and Senate, it will take a big Democratic election to have a chance at winning back both, especially the House. And whether it is Hillary or another Democratic president, I sure as hell would want to be governing without having to deal with a Republican-controlled House.Having been deeply involved in both the 1996 Clinton re-elect and the 2006 strategy that won back both houses of Congress, I can tell you that there was a huge difference in both strategies and outcomes in those years. While Clinton thankfully rejected Penn's and Dick Morris' advice in 1995 to just split the difference with Gingrich and Dole on the budget, he did take their advice in terms of overall political positioning: he ""triangulated,"" intentionally setting himself apart from congressional Democrats and running his campaign on a completely separate track from other Democrats in 1996. The result was that Dole, indelibly linked in the public's mind to a very unpopular Gingrich because of the 1995 government shutdown over the budget, was easily beaten, yet we lost two Senate seats and only picked up two House seats. In spite of the decisive budget victory, in spite of Gingrich's unpopularity, in spite of a lifeless Dole campaign, there were no Clinton coattails because of the distance he created between his campaign and other Dems. It would be the last election where a president or party nominee had so little impact on the rest of the election.  In 2006, the contrast could not have been more dramatic. While there were some differences between Democrats on message, in general the party and progressive movement worked closely together on issue fights and messaging with a goal around building a wave. Staying united and winning decisively on the Social Security fight, and creating effective messaging campaigns around Bush's failures in Iraq and with Hurricane Katrina, as well as driving message around the widespread scandal and corruption in the House under DeLay's leadership, built the wave to an unprecedented level of strength.  In a presidential turnout year, with Republican hubris and extremism on full display as they flex their newfound power, I have no doubt a big wave for the Democrats can be built. It will take smart strategic thinking about what big issue fights to pick and what dumb bipartisan deals to avoid; it will take a strong dose of economic populism in an economy overwhelmingly skewed to the top 1 percent; and it will take a unity of purpose instead of Democrats trying to set themselves apart from the core values of the party. But if we are smart and tough and relatively unified, 2016 will be a great election for the Democratic Party."

Just before being honored as a women’s rights advocate at Equality Now’s Make Equality Reality even in Beverly Hills on Monday, Hayek told People magazine she doesn’t see herself as a feminist. ""I am not a feminist,"" Hayek said on the red carpet. ""If men were going through the things women are going through today, I would be fighting for them with just as much passion. I believe in equality."" Hayek, 48, has long been a voice for women who have been denied their basic rights across the globe -- but it seems she has the wrong idea of what the feminist movement means. While many erroneously equate feminism to a form of man-hating mindset, in truth the movement’s main goal is gender equality. At the event, the star also told The Hollywood Reporter why it was so important to stop the hate against women. ""We need to make war against hate,"" Hayek said. “I think that if you hate women you hate humanity. You hate life itself because there is no man who came to this world that did not come through a woman. Until there is respect, equality and the curiosity to discover the magical miracle that is womanhood around the world we will not have a chance to find dignity for humanity.""The actress’ comment seemed especially out of place at the event, which honored Hayek and feminist Gloria Steinem. Not to mention, according to The Hollywood Reporter, host Kathy Griffin at one point said “Let’s talk about feminism. I’m sick and tired of these young girls not owning this word!” Regardless of whether Hayek is “owning” feminism or not, she says she does make it a point to not preach to her 7-year-old daughter. ""I don't preach to her every day,"" Hayek told People. ""She's aware that her mommy fights for the rights of women, that there are many places in the world where they are not entitled to the rights."" H/T Latina"

If one looks at the change in the makeup of the Senate, this seems a fair assessment. Going into Tuesday's election, the Democrats held a 53 to 45 seat majority in the Senate, with the two Independents generally caucusing with the Democrats. On Tuesday, 36 Senate seats were up for grabs. To retain control of the Senate, the Democrats needed to win at least 16 of those 36 seats. This they failed to do. It now appears that the Republicans won 23 of the 36 seats in contention, which means that the next Senate will have 53 Republican Senators.Put simply, the Republicans won 64 percent of the Senate seats up for election in 2014 (23 of 36). That does, indeed, sound like a ""landslide."" But it is not that simple. Because every state has two senators, without regard to its population, the Senate is a rather odd legislative body. It represents the states, but not the American people. Although the Republicans won 64 percent of the Senate seats up for election in 2014, they received only 52 percent of the votes. This was so because Republicans tend to live in more sparsely populated states like Alaska, Idaho, Kansas, South Dakota, and Montana, whereas Democrats tend to live in more heavily populated states like New York, California, Illinois, Michigan, and New Jersey. Thus, although the Republicans won in a ""landslide"" of Senate seats, they achieved only a modest victory in terms of overall popular vote.The problem for the Democrats in terms of the Senate is that they live in the wrong states. So, here's a plan for the Democrats to ""fix"" this problem in the future: Democrats have to move into the more sparsely populated Republican states. How many Democrats would have had to move to Republican states in order to have changed the outcome of the 2014 election and leave the Democrats in control of the Senate?In turns out that only 117,000 additional Democratic voters in Alaska, North Carolina, and South Dakota combined would have tilted the outcomes in those states and left the Democrats in control of the Senate. That's not very many. Given that young voters generally vote Democratic, how hard would it be for 117,000 underemployed young adults to do some serious public service and move to the states that are likely to have the most hotly-contested Senate races in the future? Given the role of money in politics these days, perhaps some wealthy Democratic donors would subsidize their moves.This is, of course, tongue-in-cheek (in case you were in doubt). But the central point remains: The 2014 Senate election was a Republican ""landslide"" only if you count states rather than Americans. To make the point even more clearly, although Republicans will now control 53 percent of the seats in the Senate, these Republican senators actually represent only 46 percent of the American people. It's a strange kind of landslide, indeed."

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8dc682000000f0201d4c7.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"WASHINGTON -– To say Tuesday was a bad day for environmental groups would be an understatement.In his opening remarks at a National Press Club event recapping the election results Wednesday afternoon, League of Conservation Voters President Gene Karpinski joked that environmental groups had thought twice about even holding the event. ""It wasn't the best night for us,"" he said.Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club, was even more blunt in an interview Wednesday morning. First, he recounted some of the ways 2014 was a success: It elevated the issue of climate change generally and made candidates in a number of key races change the way they talked about the issue. But when it came to electing a slate of pro-environment candidates, which environmental groups spent an unprecedented amount of money on this year, ""on that,"" Brune said, ""there's been a miserable fucking failure.""Environmental groups are mourning the loss of several key allies in the Senate, such as North Carolina Democrat Kay Hagan and Colorado Democrat Mark Udall. And they're looking at a Senate that is going to be a lot more hostile to their agenda: With Republicans in control, the upper chamber will likely seek to undo many of the actions that the Obama administration has taken to address climate change and other environmental threats. Republican leaders have made it very clear that a top priority is to pass legislation that would force approval of the Keystone XL pipeline. Environmental groups have urged President Barack Obama to reject the pipeline, and are holding onto the hope that he'd veto any such measure that comes to his desk.There are other concerns, like the fact that Sen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), a guy who wrote a book saying climate change was a giant hoax, is poised to take control of the Environment and Public Works Committee, the Senate's most powerful environmental panel. In a Wall Street Journal op-ed published Thursday that laid out their legislative agenda, House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) and likely Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also pledged to take other measures that they said would ""remove barriers to job creation and lower energy costs for families"" -- i.e., block the Obama administration from implementing a variety of environmental regulations. That's what makes environmental groups most nervous.The Republican-controlled House of Representatives has pushed for a number of measures over the last few years that the Senate will now be likely to take up: blocking the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gas emissions and mercury and ozone pollution; preventing the Army Corps of Engineers from updating rules on disposal of mine waste; blocking the Department of the Interior from enforcing rules about drilling on public lands; and limiting the department's environmental review process for oil and gas lease applications. The 60-vote filibuster in the Senate will probably keep the worst of those measures from passing as stand-alone legislation, and even if that happens, environmental groups are hopeful that Obama will veto them. A bigger concern is that these provisions could get attached as riders to must-pass spending bills. But environmental advocates are hopeful that Obama will block those as well. ""In previous fights, the president has made clear that he will not be cowed by an appropriations strategy [with] people trying to load up spending bills with provisions the public doesn't support,"" said David Goldston, director of government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, in a call with reporters Thursday.Goldston tried to see the bright side of this. A lot of what the House has passed has flown under the radar, at least in terms of news coverage, because it was not going to clear the Senate. Now, Goldson said, ""the public will now see what the Republican agenda actually is and what's at stake here … As the public sees what the extreme anti-environmental agenda is, there's a backlash.""The consequences of Tuesday's Republican wave go beyond Capitol Hill. In fact, a potentially bigger concern for those who favor addressing greenhouse gas emissions may be the results of a number of gubernatorial elections. Once the Environmental Protection Agency finalizes its new limits on emissions from power plants, each state will have to develop its own plan to meet them. And the midterm elections were mostly bad news on that front. Climate change-denying governors were re-elected in Florida, Maine and Wisconsin, and Republican candidates pulled off surprise wins over the enviro-endorsed Democrats in both Maryland and Massachusetts. ""It was a hard night last night for our governors,"" said Sierra Club political director Melissa Williams on Wednesday. ""It's something we're going to have to figure out as all these states move toward creating their emission plans.""Environmental groups say they're not turning down the heat on politicians for the next two years -- or the cash. Tuesday was ""not a referendum on climate,"" said Elizabeth Thompson, president of the Environmental Defense Action Fund. ""It was a really, really bad day for Democrats."" As for the more than $85 million environmental groups spent, she maintained that it was still ""too low."" ""It's really expensive to play effectively in politics,"" said Thompson. ""I think the resources were very well spent. I think we needed more."" In the meantime, advocates are looking for the silver linings on this election -- whatever linings they can get. One that many pointed to was the advent of the ""I'm not a scientist"" trope that many Republican candidates are using to answer climate questions. That response, environmental groups believe, might show that the party is shifting away from complete denial of climate change. ""It looks like it is now unacceptable for many candidates to say that they are denying climate science outright,"" said the Sierra Club's Brune. ""If that's true, and if that sticks, that's significant. It could portend a bigger shift in the party.""Correction: Due to an editing error, a previous version of this story incorrectly identified the affiliation of the Environmental Defense Action Fund."
