And what better filmmaker to chronicle her journey than Pratibha Parmar. I met Parmar a few years ago when she was promoting her narrative feature titled Nina's Heavenly Delights, and was immediately taken with her approach to life and filmmaking. One senses great freedom within her, a feeling that she doesn't need to live by others' rules, and those qualities translate so beautifully to the big screen. It's no surprise then that Beauty In Truth, Parmar's documentary about Alice Walker, which just premiered at the Seattle International Film Festival, is a perfect piece of filmmaking. Worthy of the sold-out screening and standing ovations it received.In Beauty In Truth, Parmar tells Walker's story by letting her narrate her own tale, in that beautiful trademark voice of hers, a woman who has lived through so much but still looks at life with enthusiasm and generosity. I realize as I write this last sentence, that it could be about both Walker and Parmar and perhaps that's the connection which makes the film such a success. Two exceptional women, talking about one exceptional woman's life, with the help of a few really exceptional friends. As a personal aside, I've admired Walker's courage lately in her open letters to artists who cross the boundaries of fairness and take sides, by simply choosing to play or tour in a country that does not allow all its citizens the same freedoms, the same quality of life. This courage, this firm belief that we are all created equal, with our best assets and our worst qualities basically adding up to a global average, is what has driven Walker's life, and what clearly steers Parmar's film. Now if we could just begin to live that way, what a wonderful world this would be.Following is my interview with Pratibha Parmar, where she talks about Walker and her well-known friends whom she managed to interview for the film. She also discloses a few updates for Beauty In Truth, so that we may all soon share in the beauty and wisdom of Alice Walker. Why Alice Walker? What drew you to her story and how did you begin thinking about this project? Pratibha Parmar: Alice Walker is not only one of the most prolific writers of our times but she is also a writer whose humanity is expressed beautifully in the art of her life. My personal connection to Alice goes back to the early 1990s when we collaborated on a documentary, Warrior Marks about the then-taboo subject of female genital mutilation. That harrowing journey both triggered and cemented our mutual respect and trust. The idea for Beauty In Truth came completely unexpectedly. Four years ago I was watching a stack of DVDs, all of them documentary stories of Americans who have made an impact on American culture. Significantly, none of these stories were of women especially women of color. The obvious question (for me, anyway) was to ask why not, and then, why not one such a film on Alice. Beauty In Truth is my contribution to filling this gaping abyss of on screen representations of women as history makers and shapers, women public intellectuals and visionary leaders. What was the biggest challenge in making your film? And the most rewarding aspect?PP: Once I started on the film, the enormous scope of Alice's story was at first a little daunting. I mean, how on earth do you do justice to a poet's life that began on the cotton fields of Georgia to sharecropper parents? How do you sketch on screen a life that has profoundly shaped and impacted cultural discourses on gender, race, sexuality, history? As Danny Glover says in the film, ""this is a woman that certainly is right there connected to every single movement that happened in the last 40 years. So in that sense you find intrinsic in her writing, is that part of her as a citizen of the world, a woman of the world, and an activist and an artist."" I wanted to find out what it takes for an individual to forge a powerful, authentic and compassionate self in the crucible of poverty, hypocrisy and cruelty? What sacrifices do you have to make so you remain true to yourself? What does this courage look like?Undoubtedly, one big reward was having the opportunity to meet and talk with people like Howard Zinn, Steven Spielberg, Quincy Jones, Sonia Sanchez and Sapphire amongst others -- these encounters and conversations were deeply enriching.Do you think cinema, a film like yours that highlights such a powerful woman, can change the outlook of its audience, and how?PP: I know I have been changed, enlightened and moved by many many films that cross national, cultural boundaries, genres and styles so yes, I think cinema can be a powerful experience, films can shift opinions, even shape histories. I mean just think the impact that a film like Granito: How to Nail a Dictator has had -- the evidence that film amassed.As a filmmaker I wanted to convey Alice's uniqueness, which I believe is her poetical lens on the world. She speaks through her writings with a clarity that is much needed now. Whenever I get overwhelmed by the absolute terror, hatred and violence inflicted on women and children we see everyday all over the world, I turn to Alice's writings to find hope. She reminds us of our humanity as people -- all the good we are capable of and the joy we can experience in the everyday and sometimes that is all you need to get you through the day. How was it editing your feature length documentary?PP: Editing was an adventure in joy and pain. At times I had to lose gems, especially since we interviewed some fascinating people in their own right. For instance, the interview I did with Yoko Ono who gave Alice Walker the ""Lennon Ono Peace Award"" for her humanitarian award, was fascinating in so many ways. I got an opportunity to talk to her about not only the award but also about her own work as an artist and her creative relationship with John Lennon. My biggest sadness is that we were not able to include a segment on The Color Purple musical. We did fantastic interviews with Scott Sanders, the producer and the composers Allee Willis, Brenda Russell as well as LaChanze who won a Tony for playing Celie. But we didn't have the money to clear all the union fees for the footage from the musical and without these visuals, that story couldn't really be told. Where is the film going next?PP: After Seattle International Film Festival, Beauty In Truth is the closing night film at Toronto Inside Out Film Festival on June 2nd, it's the ""Fusion Centerpiece"" screening at Outfest in Los Angeles on July 18th and the centerpiece screening at QFest in Philidelphia on 20th July. We have other screenings coming up in Atlanta, New York, Washington D.C. San Francisco. More and more cities are being added everyday.All images courtesy of Kali Films Ltd, used with permission"

We'd become virtual friends via Twitter, connecting through a group of writers who support each others' work. He was friendly and witty, I was interested in learning more him. The publication of his new novel, An Ordinary Boy, proved just the opportunity.Kergan Edwards-Stout: Brian, it's great to connect with you again, and congratulations on your new book! Your online bio is very charming and witty, but give me some of your backstory.Brian Centrone: Thanks, Kergan. The bio on my website is an attempt to write about myself without having to write about myself in a formal manner. I grew up in the Bronx and attended Catholic school for nine years. It was in the third grade that I caught the writing bug. The school was putting together their first-ever creative writing journal, and I was determined to get published in it. I told my teacher I wanted to write a novel, and she corrected me by saying ""short story,"" but I was really talking about bigger dreams than just the school publication. My story did get published, and I was over the moon. It wasn't until years later that I realized they published every student who submitted work. My story was about three friends that received an apparition from the Virgin Mary and thus become priests and a nun. It's God-awful, but it's my very first publication, and it did fuel my desire to be a writer. I've been keeping that one a secret for years! Edwards-Stout: Aside from the nuns, what moments in your own life have had the greatest impact on you, and how did those moments shape who you've become?Centrone: Like Tom in An Ordinary Boy, there have been many moments in my life that made me better understand who I was as a person and what I truly wanted in this life. One has to be losing my virginity at the old age of 23 in a London hotel room. I eventually turned that experience into the erotic short story, ""Mates,"" which became my first major fiction publication. That story started my career. New Lit Salon Press will be publishing a collection of my erotic short stories later this year, and of course ""Mates"" will lead the pack. Edwards-Stout: That sounds intriguing!Centrone: Another impactful moment would be being told by a handful of writing program directors that I wasn't a good enough writer, and that teaching high school would probably be a good fit for me. Those types of rejections messed with my mind for a long time. Then, one day, it finally clicked, and I realized that I didn't want to spend my time trying to please academics who weren't fans of my writing. There were plenty of other editors, publishers and readers who were. It was those people I was writing for. It freed me in so many ways. Edwards-Stout: I can relate. Negative comments can really affect our sense of self.Centrone: The last major impactful moment of my life was getting to hold Madonna's hand while she sang ""Like a Prayer."" I wrote a blog post about it where you can get the full impact of this experience, but I will say this: It was absolutely religious. I knew in that moment that anything I desired was possible, that there was no end to realizing your dreams. Edwards-Stout: An Ordinary Boy tells the story of Tom, a young man entering college. What can you tell us about his journey?Centrone: Tom's journey is not an uncommon one. He's 18, starting college and hungry for independence. He believes that going away to college will allow him the freedom to explore who he really is, in particular as a gay man. But with that freedom and independence comes great responsibility. Tom's been heavily influenced by his family and his best friend, Marissa. Now that he is on his own, he has to learn to deal with his first relationship, love vs. lust, the gay social scene and college roommates. It's a story of self-discovery and what it ultimately takes for us to finally figure out who we are.   Edwards-Stout: What was your inspiration for the novel?Centrone: Originally, when I first conceived of this novel more than a decade ago, my inspiration was Matthew Shepard. His killing had a profound effect on me. I wanted to tell a story that showed how gay people loved the same way as straight people, made the same mistakes as straight people, that we were no different than them. Over the course of the writing process, it morphed into a desire to tell a cautionary tale about what to expect after high school. I wanted to go beyond the high school happy endings of young adult fiction and introduce new adult readers to the complicated world of college. Edwards-Stout: You published An Ordinary Boy through Seventh Window Publications. Tell me a bit about your publishing journey.Centrone: My publishing journey isn't the normal journey young writers grow up believing in. I don't have an agent; there was no six-figure advance; The New York Times isn't praising my brilliance -- yet. I went down the indie route and found a small publisher who was willing to take a risk the big boys aren't always willing to take. I knew I had a story to tell. All I needed was to find a publisher who knew it too. I had been social media friends with Ken Harrison (publisher of Seventh Window) since the MySpace days. We had chatted from time to time about projects I was working on, but one day I posted on Facebook that I had finally finished revising and editing my novel and that it was ready to submit. Ken saw that post and asked me about the book. There was some back and forth before he asked me to send him the novel. He called me almost instantly and told me he wanted to publish it, but that a lot of work had to be done, mainly changing the novel from first-person to third. I wept silently while on the phone with him. I had been dreaming of that day since third grade. That was almost four years ago. The editing process seemed endless, but it was a good experience, and I learned more from working with Ken than I ever did from writing classes. Edwards-Stout: Prior to An Ordinary Boy, you published I Voted for Biddy Schumacher, which was a collection of three shorter pieces. You've also written an array of short stories. What kinds of things are you most inspired to write?Centrone: First and foremost, I want to write a good story. It's important to me that my readers are able to relate to the tales that I am telling, and that my writing can serve as an escape for them. With that said, my stories really vary because I'm inspired by so many different things. For instance, ""Biddy Schumacher"" is a satirical story about a middle-aged woman who decides to run for political office in her small town. I had a writing professor who noted once that most of my fiction was about relationships. I was surprised at this, because I hadn't consciously decided to write about relationships, but on further inspection, relationships and identity seem to be major themes in my work. I think that's particularly true about An Ordinary Boy and very much what the three stories in I Voted for Biddy Schumacher are all about. Edwards-Stout: In an interview you did with Lambda Literary, you mentioned some of the writers you admire, which was a diverse list of everyone from Truman Capote to Jacqueline Susann and Bret Easton Ellis. What, to you, is good writing?Centrone: To me, good writing sweeps you away. It could be anything from voice to masterful prose to a captivating plot. It doesn't always have to be technically perfect, but it always has to have that ""it"" factor.Edwards-Stout: Are there particular books you've read that you consider touchstones?Centrone: Absolutely. Valley of the Dolls, Peyton Place and American Psycho were early definitive novels for me. Blue Boy by Rakesh Satyal, Peter Cameron's Someday This Pain Will Be Useful to You and Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit by Jeannette Winterson are books I consider to be the bar. I am equally in awe of anything Jenn Ashworth writes. I actually studied writing with her at the Centre for New Writer at the University of Manchester. Her first novel, A Kind of Intimacy, blew me away. These are just some books I think everyone should read.Edwards-Stout: You've written a great many things, culminating with this new novel. Of all your work, is there one that feels most personal to you?Centrone: Obviously I infuse my experiences and interests into much of what I write, but I really try to detach from the work personally. I think it makes it a little easier to be criticized. You don't end up feeling as if you are being personally attacked, though with that said, I recently wrote a one-act play called We, the Jury that was produced in Ohio as part of the National Foundation for the Arts' The Big Read programming. Inspired by Harper Lee's To Kill a Mocking Bird, the play was born out of my pain and sadness due to the recent spate of gay teen suicides. It was cathartic to write and highly emotional to watch. Edwards-Stout: Where would you like to see yourself 10 years down the road?Centrone: Lunching with Madonna, discussing my latest New York Times bestselling novel and our boy toys of the month.

2,QUEER VOICES,Marriage Equality Stalls in Illinois: An In-Depth Look,"Waymon Hudson, Contributor

Supporters and non-supporters of equal marriage rights gathered outside the Cook County (Illinois) Marriage License Bureau located in Chicago's City Hall in reaction to the state of Massachusetts legalizing the practice of same-sex marriages. (Photo by Tim Boyle/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bafb65d250000cf0037f0ca.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Same-sex couples in Illinois will have to wait even longer for equal rights. In a move that shocked many community members and advocates, the Illinois House ended its current session without calling a vote on the Marriage Equality Bill, SB10. The Religious Freedom and Marriage Fairness Act will now sit in legislative limbo until the fall's ""veto session,"" where bill sponsor Representative Greg Harris has said he will once again try to put it forward. This current failure in the Illinois General Assembly follows a successful Valentine's Day vote by the Illinois Senate of 34 to 21, as well as vocal support from Governor Pat Quinn, who has said he would sign the bill into law.A visibly emotional and upset Rep. Greg Harris made the announcement from the house floor, saying the 60 votes needed for passage simply weren't there and that colleagues had asked for ""more time"" for a vote. ""I have never been sadder to accept such a request,"" Harris said through tears. ""In the meantime, I apologize to the families who were hoping to wake up full and equal citizens.""The stalled marriage bill comes at a time when Democrats hold a veto-proof majority of 71 Dems to just 47 Republicans. Yet pressure from the politically powerful Catholic Church in Illinois as well as some conservative African-American clergy seemed to have peeled off enough support from the bill among some conservative-leaning downstate Democrats, a portion of Black Caucus members, as well as Republicans for the needed 60 votes to fall short.The current defeat also comes after an earlier unsuccessful attempt by marriage equality advocates in Illinois to pass the marriage equality bill during the lame-duck legislative session in early January. At that time, the bill was successfully voted out of the Senate Executive Committee, but was not considered by the full chamber due to procedural hurdles.It seems the long road to full equality in ""The Prairie State"" will continue to wind on, at least for now, as marriage equality supporters look ahead to both the veto session in the house and the current marriage lawsuit making its way through the Illinois court system brought by Lambda Legal and the ACLU.Illinois Civil Unions: Separate And UnequalIn 2011 Illinois passed the Illinois Religious Freedom Protection and Civil Union Act, a so-called ""everything but marriage"" law that provided strong civil unions through the state legislature. The act reads broadly about what it provided for same-sex couples, stating:This Act shall be liberally construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes, which are to provide adequate procedures for the certification and registration of a civil union and provide persons entering into a civil union with the obligations, responsibilities, protections, and benefits afforded or recognized by the law of Illinois to spouses. (750 ILCS 75/5)In short, anyone in a civil union got the same state benefits as someone who is married. The act even put in purposefully broad language about being ""liberally construed"" to implement the purpose and spirit of the law.Yet almost immediately, problems with civil unions arose. There was a drawn-out legal battle between Catholic Charities and the state of Illinois over the $30 million in taxpayer dollars that the religious charity received for foster care and adoption services, and their refusal to grant those services to same-sex couples in civil unions, which ended in a loss for the church. This led to a growing tension between the church hierarchy and advancing civil rights. Cardinal Francis George of Chicago likened the city's pride parade to the Ku Klux Klan, sparking outrage, protests and an eventual half-apology from the cardinal. There was also the case of the Springfield, Ill., Joint Labor/Management Insurance Committee deciding not to cover health benefits for the civil union partners of city employees. The committee used the different relationship status of same-sex couples and married heterosexual couples to carve out the exemption to civil union spouses. They cited the benefits for same-sex couples being too costly, which is an argument that would never be accepted when applied to a more universally understood institution like full marriage. Public outrage eventually made them change their decision and cover all couples equally.Perhaps the most illuminating example is the confusing decision by the Illinois Department of Revenue saying that couples in civil unions ""may not file joint Illinois returns,"" and that the new civil unions law ""did not change the Illinois income tax laws."" After much pushing from legislators and the community, the department reversed their decision, allowing same-sex couples in civil unions to file jointly in the state. Yet this confusion within the state government itself over the law shows just how easy it is for civil unions to fall short.In a show of just how unequal civil unions were, 25 gay and lesbian couples represented by Lambda Legal and the American Civil Liberties Union of Illinois brought a lawsuit seeking to overturn Illinois' 16-year-old ban on same-sex marriages. Cook County State's Attorney Anita Alvarez and Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan decided not to defend the state's ban on same-sex marriage and agreed with the lawsuit that the ban is unconstitutional. Cook County Clerk David Orr, who is the subject of the original suits, also agreed that the law was unconstitutional and refuses to defend it as well. A judge granted two downstate Illinois county clerks permission to defend the ban. The Thomas Moore Society, a conservative Chicago-based not-for-profit law firm that opposes gay marriage, filed that request to intervene on behalf of Effingham County Clerk Kerry Hirtzel and Tazewell County Clerk Christie Webb.Illinois State Rep. Greg Harris (D-Chicago) has made clear that the current civil unions law does not offer full equality. ""I think the lawsuits that we are seeing move through the courts right now are showing clearly that ... all over the state, there are numerous instances where families are being denied their basic rights under civil unions,"" Harris said.In fact, research has shown that in area after area -- whether tax law, health insurance, hospitalization, family issues, personal finance or actions by state and local officials -- same-sex couples, even ones in civil unions, are treated unequally, denied their basic rights or singled out for discrimination.These are all glaring examples of why separate is never equal and why moving toward marriage equality was vitally necessary, even if difficult. Civil unions have created a lower class of recognition that, while providing much-needed rights and protections, reinforced the idea that LGBT relationships were less than their heterosexual counterparts. Creating this new, separate and different level of rights and recognition among committed couples only created further inequity, confusion and discord.Civil unions were considered a first step but never an end goal.Strong OppositionAmong the strongest opposition to marriage equality was the highly influential and politically powerful Catholic Church. In September 2012 the Catholic Conference of Illinois announced the formation of a Defense of Marriage department, whose sole purpose was to fight any future attempts to legalize same-sex marriage in the state. The stated goal of the department was to protect the ""stature of the nuclear family -- which provides love, stability and confidence to children, as well as organization to society."" The Defense of Marriage department started throwing out incendiary (and scientifically unfounded) claims about the ""dangers"" of marriage equality: ""The effects [of same-sex marriage] are evident in the performance of children in school, in truancy and crime rates, and in an ailing culture that too often values feeling good over self-giving, and individuality over the common good.""Even then-Pope Benedict XVI himself continued the attacks, on marriage equality, saying that gay marriage was a threat to the traditional family that undermined ""the future of humanity itself.""And the Catholic Church wasn't alone in its opposition. Anticipating the fight over passage of a marriage equality bill, the Coalition to Protect Children and Marriage was unveiled by equality opponents on Dec. 18, 2012. It included the extreme anti-equality organizations like the Illinois Family Institute, Concerned Christian Americans, the Eagle Forum of Illinois, the Illinois Citizens for Life PAC, the Abstinence and Marriage Partnership, Lake County Right to Life and Family-Pac.A group of of conservative African-American clergy also provided fierce opposition. Bishop Larry Trotter, co-chair of the African American Clergy Coalition, released a statement applauding the bill's current failure, writing, ""Today our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ has won! Pastor James Meeks, Bishop Lance Davis and I are so proud of the God fearing Black Caucus members who withstood the pressure of the LGBT forces and allowed God's word concerning marriage to remain between one man and one woman in Illinois.""But even this concerted and powerful religious-based opposition, though seemingly successful in swaying some members of the Illinois House, wasn't enough to stop full marriage equality for gay and lesbian couples from enjoying majority support from Illinois voters.A Right Delayed, A Right DeniedThe Religious Freedom and Marriage Fairness Act has far-reaching implications for Illinois' same-sex couples. Under the bill, marriage in Illinois would have changed from an act between ""a man and a woman"" to one ""between two people."" What the law means is simple: ALL couples in Illinois would have the same rights and responsibilities that come with full marriage equality. No one will have to awkwardly say that they are ""civil unioned,"" then explain what that means to those who don't know. Couples would all just be married, gay or straight. The confusion over the ""separate and unequal"" status of same-sex couples, and the problems we have seen under the civil unions law, will come to an end within the state.These civil unions could have been converted to full marriages within a year of the law going on the books, with out-of-state marriages being recognized immediately. And despite the objections and scare-tactics used by the religious based opposition, the legislation would not have required religious organizations to solemnize a marriage of gay couples, nor would church officials have been forced to allow their facilities to be used by same-sex couples seeking to marry.The new law could have also meant a financial boon for Illinois. A recent study from The Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law found that extending equal marriage to same-sex couples could add up to $103 million to the state economy and $8.5 million in new state and local tax revenue.Marriage equality in Illinois would have also had far broader impact on same-sex couples in the state as the U.S. Supreme Court takes on the constitutionality of the so-called ""Defense of Marriage Act,"" which denies same-sex couples federal benefits equal to their married heterosexual counterparts. The court is expected to rule in June, long before the veto session of the Illinois House. If the act is struck down, the federal government will recognize the marriages of same-sex couples, giving gay couples the full array of rights available to married heterosexual couples. If the law is overturned, couples in Illinois could have seen full marriage equality both within the state and federally in the same year.But for now, same-sex couples in Illinois will have to continue the long process of watching legislators, judges, politicians, priests, organizations, and every other possible person weigh in on what their relationships should or shouldn't be. They will have to continue to navigate the maze of what it means to be a same-sex couple simply wishing to declare their love--and access the rights and responsibilities that come with marriage."

""Samantha got Lindsay at a very vulnerable time in her life,"" he continued, ""when her mom and dad were going through a divorce. Lindsay started partying and drinking. She didn't know where to go. And Samantha got her when she was down. Samantha dragged her to her level which is below the barrel."" The famed spinner didn't take kindly too Michael's words. When Lindsay first publicly confirmed she was dating Ronson during an interview with Harper's Bazaar, she said her family was supportive of the decision. But Michael has always had a problem with the famous producer, whom he once described as ""controlling and manipulative.""As for Lindsay's feelings about Ronson today, they are not so positive. During an interview with Piers Morgan for the Daily Mail, the ""Liz & Dick"" actress called the relationship ""toxic."" She denied being bisexual, and chalked up the romance to experimentation and her not wanting to be alone. "

Sure, we love a good plate of maduros (the dish made with sweet and softly cooked plantains) just as much as the next person, but tostones take something that we normally associate as being sweet -- which is anything in the banana family really -- and makes them an addictive, savory side. Tostones are made with firm, green plantains -- the fact that we don't need to wait for the banana-like fruit to ripen is definitely a bonus. Cut into one inch pieces, you fry, flatten, then fry the plantain again before salting it generously. They put French fries to shame. Seriously.Want to read more from HuffPost Taste?

The intention of the post is to speak to the vast majority of relationships we are walking away from, without conversation or efforts to enforce our boundaries, because we write them off simply as being ""negative.""This is a two-part series, in my next one I'll talk about how to approach friendships we feel are unhealthy, but I want to write this prerequisite post to help clarify the difference between the roles of friends in our lives versus others with whom we're called to still live beside in the same world. There is something in my soul that stirs with a dis-ease every time I hear some form of the increasingly popular advice: ""Only surround yourself with positive people. Get rid of negative people!""Good Advice? ""Only Surround Yourself with Positive People.""It can be found in little cute quote boxes shared everywhere on Facebook saying things like ""People inspire you, or they drain you. Pick wisely."" It's advice that is freely given from self-help experts with little explanation other than what sounds like a command, ""If their presence can't add value to your life, then their absence will make no difference."" It comes in many well-intending forms, all with the goal of making us better people: ""Surround yourself with only people who are going to lift you higher.""We've actually been hearing this barrage for so long now that I suspect most of us just accept these quotables as irrevocable truth. But these single-sentence aphorisms can be misleading at best, damaging at worst.Needy People in Our LivesThe question isn't whether we let needy or depressed people into our lives. The question is how much do we let them in, and for what purpose.The truth is that we have to learn to be around hurting people -- not only because it's unrealistic that we can avoid them, but how else will we serve this world with what we each have to offer? We can, and must, be around people who judge, whine, attack, and defend. We're related to some of them, we work for some of them, and sometimes we have been or are those people. The more important issue is whether we're counting on these individuals to be our closest friends.Our friends -- the handful of people we choose to let close to our hearts -- must fulfill the four requirements of friendship by being, more often than not, a) consistent b) contributing c) self-revealing, and d) positive. You clarify those quotes above with the words ""closest friends"" instead of ""people"" and I won't squirm. (Or at least not as much... truthfully, even our friends can't always be all those things without there being misunderstandings and hurt feelings at times. But I'm okay with us striving toward those qualities with our inner circle.)But before we evaluate our friendships in the next post, let us own what is ours to own: We are not victims to other people's pain. We are healers. Ultimately it's around hurting people who we're meant to be around, each of us giving the gift that is ours to give to those who need it.This isn't a world made up of friends and enemies, rather it's a world of friends and people to be friendly toward. Enemies must be crushed and eliminated, whereas hurting, jealous, toxic, unhealthy people must be loved and healed. Just because someone isn't our closest friend doesn't mean they don't have value in our lives.To be clear, we don't have to be close to them; in fact, we should be very mindful and intentional about who we pull into our lives in a close and trusting relationship. But if we know our boundaries, feel we have extra love and energy to give, and are sure that we can show up in a healing way, then certainly that is an option more of us can consider.Elimination Is Not Always NecessaryTo suggest that I can't be around anyone who isn't at their best because it will bring me down glosses over my own strength. Any of us who have been pastors, social workers, therapists, or in any other people-helping industries can attest to the fact that as long as we are practicing our own self-care, have our own support system in place, and are clear about our role in the lives of people who are hurting, then our positive influence can be greater in their lives than their pain will be in ours. Light is more powerful than darkness. And hurt people need love and light.The answer isn't just to eliminate and ostracize hurting people, the answer is to learn how to shine our lights so brightly that we can enter any darkness and know that our light cannot be extinguished.And not just that our light can survive, but actually that our light gets stronger and more compassionate and more life-transforming as we show up in genuine moments with others, no matter what condition they are in. We are blessed and grown in those moments just as much as they are.We do not become the people who this world needs simply by turning our backs on anyone we don't like, trust, or deem healthy enough to be in our presence. No, in fact, those are exactly the people we need to let into our lives. Not just for their sake, but for ours. To serve others is what we're called to do in this world -- your calling centers around it. To learn how to forgive is the greatest lesson any of us can ever hope to learn (which means we will need to practice it a number of times). To sit with someone in pain increases our ability to empathize, which increases our ability to trust and love, which is ultimately what you want: more love.If your light is dim or flickering, then perhaps you may need to set some boundaries and limit time with people who you feel can't support the happier and more powerful version of yourself; but that's temporary, and something to own in yourself rather than blame in others.Re-Defining the Good AdviceHere's how I re-interpret these ever-popular quotes to put the responsibility on me, rather than the blame on others.""People inspire you, or they drain you. Pick wisely.""  I am not picking people, rather I am picking my response. I get to decide whether I am inspired or drained. I can be around someone who is shining and walk away drained by jealousy, or I can sit with someone who is chronically depressed and walk away inspired and grateful. My power doesn't mean I get to pick who's valuable, it means I get to pick whether I'm able to see the value in everyone.""If their presence can't add value to your life, then their absence will make no difference."" This is such a dangerous quote. Taken to the extreme, wars are fought, holocausts are allowed, and racism and classism are justified. No, if their presence doesn't add value to your life, it's either because you haven't taken the time to get to know them yet or you haven't yet seen who you can become because of them. It is not because they are without value.""Surround yourself with only people who are going to lift you higher."" In the closest circle of your life, I agree that this is a good ideal. We want to create relationships that nurture, uplift, empower, and love each other well. But even this has its limits -- because it's not others who end up deciding whether we lift higher or not, it's our call. Sometimes it's the person who wounded us the deepest that pushes us to grow and lift. The universe can use anyone and everyone to help us become our best selves.This was a hard post to write -- so many caveats I want to give, possible misunderstandings I want to avoid. I end it with a prayer that these words will land where hearts are receptive and ready to see just how powerful we are, how others cannot limit us, and how much the world, as needy as it is, needs us to not turn our backs. For what's the point of getting healthy if not to turn around and love others to their best as well?My next blog will be about what to do when our friendships aren't living up to all four of the required qualities in a friendship and how to make decisions about the best approach to either healing them or limiting them in our lives. Subscribe in the upper right corner here.

We've had a lot of great times over the years, but lately, you just haven't been yourself. Strawberry-Kiwi (or Kiwi-Strawberry, or whatever you want us to call you these days), we've tried hard to remember the glory days of our relationship. You used to be in fruit salads. You used to be in smoothies. We were happy to support your creativity when you wanted to try being a popsicle. But it's just gone too far. For starters, let's talk about your juicing problem. As we said before, it was fine when you dabbled in smoothies, but now we're finding you everywhere from Snapple to Gatorade to Shasta. Now you're getting mixed up with green tea, a known flavor-abuser, and we just can't watch you do it to yourself anymore. How do you think it makes us feel to see you so content to degrade your flavor profile this way? What we used to love about you was your individuality. Strawberries and kiwis have nearly the same texture, but the sweetness of strawberry and the tartness of kiwi were a beautiful counter-point to one another. The new you makes these subtle flavors nearly indistinguishable. The new you seems to value the flavor of sugar over any of your more compelling qualities. The new you is muddy, and it's made us unbearably sad. We wish you the best, honestly. We hope you have the good sense to stay out of Kool-Aid from this point forward, but we're not going to get our hopes up. Go do some soul searching. Maybe ask yourself if V-8 Splash is really the legacy you want to leave behind. We hope someday, you're able to look in the mirror and see the two fruits we loved so much. Until then, please don't contact us. We'll try to avoid the fruit salad so things don't get awkward.We'll miss you,  HuffPost TasteWant to read more from HuffPost Taste?
