If you are particularly blessed, their presence will inspire you to be your best and strongest self. Other than my own forebears, Amiri Baraka was that person for me, as he was for so many others. I met Amiri at the age of 15 at 502 High Street, ""the Hekalu,"" the headquarters of the Committee for Unified Newark. I was a wide-eyed, gung-ho street soldier. Amiri Baraka was our leader. He was also the first truly free black man I'd ever met. And he lived it with the combination of style and swagger that only he could pull off. Amiri's gifts were prodigious, and so was his capacity for inspiration. That is because he walked his talk. His every word and breath was for liberationist revolution. He was the very embodiment of a committed, self-sacrificing revolutionary. And he did it with eloquence of pen and tongue, unerring courage and principles he refused to compromise, even when his well-being was at stake. Amiri was my first intellectual model. His extraordinary powers of analysis, his stirring oratory, the great breadth of his learning, his magical way with words and images all conspired to give me a new appreciation for the value of dictionaries and inspired me to read widely and eclectically. I found myself ensconced in Lao Tze, Frantz Fanon, Amilcar Cabral, Kwame Nkrumah, James Baldwin, the Qur'an, the Egyptian Book of the Dead -- and, of course, the works of Baraka. Because of him, I and every brother I knew fancied ourselves to be wordsmiths. For us it was hip to be a poet and a ""deep"" thinker. We'd recite and pontificate wherever we were, stretching and testing our powers of rhyme, reasoning and recollection. By the strength of his example and his luminous literary countenance, Amiri gave birth to a whole generation of street-corner intellectuals, writers and political strategists, some of whom went on to become exceptional writers and thinkers in their own right. My lifelong love affair with jazz also began under Baraka's tutelage. He brought to our weekly ""Soul Session"" gatherings musical geniuses like Sun Ra, Gary Bartz, Hamiett Bluiett, Grachan Moncur, the great John Hicks, Pharoah Sanders and Rahsaan Roland Kirk. It was under Amiri's musical wing that I fell in love with Trane's ""Giant Steps"" and learned to appreciate what he called the ""out cats,"" like Ra, Albert Ayler and Ornette Coleman. But Amiri's influence on me was more than cultural. My political consciousness was raised to center stage during those years under him. I'd had a smoldering sense of racial outrage since childhood, but under Amiri's white-hot oratory it burst into flame. His words gave shape and coherence to my swirling political thoughts and feelings. Amiri's disquisitions on the implications of political events, both national and international, were my first lessons in political analysis. Watching him channel his righteous anger, outrage and boldness into political action was my second lesson. He did not seem to stew over anything. Either he'd act on it or he'd leave it alone. In that sense he was the archetypical activist intellectual. I think what was most remarkable about Amiri, and what impacted me most, his political brilliance notwithstanding, was his political courage. He exemplified it, embodied it. He was almost recklessly unafraid to speak his truth wherever, whenever and to whomever he thought it necessary. His willingness to stand up to the forces of white supremacy stripped it of its mystique and gave to me, and to untold numbers of black people, a sense of power over our own political destinies that might have been unthinkable before. Who Amiri Baraka was, what he did and what he represented challenged me to stretch myself, to believe in my own power, in my ability to change the world. By example he gave me and so many other young people a sense of mission and meaning for our lives. What I gained from the blessing of knowing Amiri Baraka, from learning from him in the crucial formative time of my youth, is precious beyond words. I've had many important influences in my life. Yet I have no doubt that without the presence of Amiri Baraka in it, I would not be the person I am today. And everyone in my world would be poorer for it.This post originally appeared on Ebony.com."

Archaeologists now say the 39 skulls are probably all that's left of young men beheaded by Roman soldiers or felled by their opponents in gladiatorial contests almost 2,000 years ago.The skulls were originally excavated in 1988 by laborers in the heart of London, according to History.com. They were moved to the Museum of London, where they languished in storage until Dr. Rebecca Redfern, a researcher from the museum's Center for Human Bioarchaeology, decided to give them a new look.""It is not a pretty picture,"" Redfern said, according to the Guardian. ""At least one of the skulls shows evidence of being chewed at by dogs, so it was still fleshed when it was lying in the open.""Redfern and her colleague Heather Bonney dated the skulls to between 120 and 160 A.D., the Independent reported. The battered skulls, believed to have belonged to men in their 20s and 30s, show pretty clearly that ""violence was a common feature of their life,"" the researchers wrote in their study, published online Jan. 10 in the Journal of Archaeological Science.""We believe that some of the heads may be people who were killed in the [amphitheater],"" Redfern told The Guardian. ""Decapitation was a way of finishing off gladiators, but not everyone who died in the Roman [amphitheater] was a gladiator, it was where common criminals were executed, or sometimes for entertainment you'd give two of them swords and have them kill one another.""Whether the remains represent gladiators, executed criminals, or prisoners of war, they represent some of the first evidence documenting a darker side of the Roman empire in the British isles. ""The view of bloodthirsty Romans has wide currency, but this is the first time that we have evidence of these types of violent acts in London,"" Redfern said, according to the BBC."
3,SCIENCE,Funding Cancer Research: The Danger of Brightly Colored Ribbons,"Joaquin M. Espinosa, Contributor

But cancer is more a disease of genes than one of specific tissues, so the specialization of our research and educational efforts based solely on a given cancer's tissue of origin could have detrimental aspects.",2014-01-18,Breast Cancer Awareness Ribbon against white background,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5baebdc1200000e800ff61e9.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Pink ribbons are for breast cancer, dark blue ribbons are for colon cancer, white ribbons are for lung cancer, gray ribbons are for brain cancer, emerald green ribbons are for liver cancer, and zebra-striped ribbons are for carcinoid cancers. January is cervical cancer awareness month, represented by the teal-and-white ribbon. February is for gallbladder and bile duct cancers, with a kelly green ribbon to represent them. And so on.As cancer kills more people than ever before, it is natural for us to seek affiliation with those affected by a similar cancer type. Breast cancer patients, survivors and their friends and relatives coalesce their efforts to create awareness and raise funds for breast cancer research and prevention. The same goes for those affected by other cancers, and there is nothing wrong with that. At a time when the National Cancer Institute is losing purchasing power at a scary pace, and when cancer researchers struggle to fund their laboratories, every fundraising and educational effort from organized citizens makes a big difference. However, we must be very cautious about how brightly we color our ribbons. If there is a key lesson that we have learned over the last 40 years of research, it is that cancer is more a disease of genes than a disease of specific tissues. We know for a fact that mutations in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes drive cancer. Most importantly, we have learned that many of these genes are commonly mutated across cancers of different tissue origin. Mutations in the RAS oncogene are commonly found in many cancer types. The same is true for mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53. A pancreatic cancer patient and a lung cancer patient whose tumors harbor mutations in RAS and p53 have much more in common than they might think. Targeted therapies aimed at restoring the normal activities of RAS and p53 may help both of them. On the other hand, two women with breast cancer may be suffering from drastically different diseases, due to the distinct genetic alterations found in their tumors. A ""triple negative"" breast cancer patient carries a tumor that does not express the estrogen receptor, the progesterone receptor or the growth factor receptor known as HER2. Her prognosis and course of treatment are radically different from her friend with ""triple positive"" breast cancer. The ""triple negative"" patient will not benefit from drugs that oppose estrogen action or that block the HER2 oncoprotein. Her prognosis is worse than that of her ""triple positive"" friend, who would benefit from these drugs.Therefore, the specialization of our research and educational efforts based solely on a given cancer's tissue of origin could have detrimental aspects. We should prevent the segregation of researchers and educators along the wrong boundaries. As the age of personalized molecular medicine advances, we should recognize the molecular commonalities across diverse cancer types and act accordingly. Some cancer funding agencies put too much emphasis during their grant review process on whether the applicant scientist has specialized expertise on this or that tissue, ignoring that said scientist may be an expert on a given oncogene or tumor suppressor gene relevant to many cancer types. A mechanistic discovery made by this scientist while employing pancreatic cancer cells in his experiments may greatly impact on the diagnosis and treatment of lung cancer patients whose tumors harbor similar genetic alterations. To discourage his research efforts because he has not focused on a single tissue of origin will be a great disservice. We must think more about genes, less about specific tissues.I look forward to the day when our fundraising, funding and educational efforts fully recognize the genetic basis of our cancers. Maybe one day in the near future we will have purple ribbons for RAS, dark blue ribbons for p53 and pink ribbons for HER2."

This marks the 21st consecutive year in which the company has led the U.S. in patents awarded. Based on data from IFI CLAIMS Patent Service, a company that compiles global patent data, these are the 10 most innovative companies in the world.Click here to see 24/7 Wall Street's most innovative companies in the worldMost of the top patent producers are technology companies active in a wide range of businesses. Companies such as IBM (NYSE: IBM), Canon, and Panasonic are involved in a variety of different businesses. Toshiba is active in sectors ranging from consumer electronics to nuclear power. According to Mike Baycroft, CEO of IFI CLAIMS Patent Services, these companies have a track record of developing intellectual property, “and they’re there to stay.”Many of the companies granted the most U.S. patents are actually foreign-based. Only three of the 10 most innovative companies in 2013 were based in the U.S.: IBM, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Qualcomm (NASDAQ: QCOM). Four Japanese companies made the top 10, led by Canon with 3,825 patents. Two South Korean companies made the list as well.While many of the top innovators consistently make the list, the shift to mobile devices could mean opportunities for new companies. This year Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), which produce the two most popular mobile operating systems, moved well up the list. In the process, IFI noted, they passed Intel and Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ) as Silicon Valley’s patent leaders. Meanwhile, Samsung, which is the world’s largest mobile phone maker, is already the second-largest recipient of U.S. patents.Baycroft told 24/7 Wall St. he would not be surprised to see Apple and Google in the top 10 come 2014. “Even BlackBerry….had one of the strongest portfolios around, despite the fact that it is, by all other reports, stressed,” he added.In order to identify the 10 most innovative companies, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed top U.S. patent recipients in 2013, according to IFI CLAIMS Patent Services’ annual report.

Target faces lawsuits from customers after announcing that the credit card information of 40 million customers who shopped at the retailer between December 15 and 27 were stolen. The case files claim that Target failed to maintain reasonable security procedures for customer safety.The company sued by many clients in US courts. If the number of lawsuits increases, a joint case is to be formed by extending the case file.

The attacks against the retailers only came to light after Brian Krebs, an independent cybersecurity reporter, began asking them questions.The fact that both merchants didn’t disclose the thefts of customer data until they were pressured highlights what experts say is a troubling culture of secrecy with hacking victims that allows cybercriminals to thrive. Companies that get hacked often keep quiet for weeks or longer, withholding valuable information that could protect consumers and other businesses from similar attacks.The Secret Service and Justice Department notified Target of the breach on Dec. 13, The New York Times reported Friday. The company disclosed the attack publicly six days later on Dec. 19. Target chief executive Gregg Steinhafel has said the company disclosed the attack after it “confirmed that we have an issue.""It took almost an additional month for investigators to release a report on the Target breach, revealing Thursday that the theft of 40 million credit cards was part of a hacking campaign focused on multiple retailers. “The fact that it took almost a month for details to come out about what actually hit Target is inexcusable,” Krebs told The Huffington Post. “Target should have told the rest of the retail industry weeks ago.""On Friday, IntelCrawler, a cyber-security firm, said it found that six other retailers also had been hacked with the same piece of malware used in the Target attack. IntelCrawler did not identify the retailers.Dmitri Alperovitch, chief technology officer of the cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike, said the widespread nature of the attacks highlights why companies should share data about breaches. Companies could tell each other about the IP addresses and malicious code used when they were hacked, allowing others to protect themselves against being targeted. “Everyone is operating in their own silo,” Alperovitch said. “People don’t share information. If these companies do not come out and say [they were hacked], we have a problem on our hands.”Neiman Marcus said it discovered on Jan. 1 that cybercriminals had stolen credit card data from its stores to make fraudulent purchases, but waited until Jan. 10 to disclose the attacks publicly. The breach had gone undetected since July, according to The Times.A Neiman Marcus spokeswoman has said the delay in going public was because the company was investigating the extent of the attack. Hacking victims have several motives for not talking about breaches publicly. Companies' lawyers typically advise keeping quiet because they face potential lawsuits. The news also may damage stock prices and reputations. But not every victim is silent. In 2009, Heartland Payments Systems, a payment processor, revealed that millions of credit and debit cards were stolen from its computer network. Heartland went public, even though its lawyers advised otherwise, because “we felt it was important,” the company’s chief information officer told The New York Times last year.“Until then, most people tried to sweep breaches under the rug,” Steve Elefant said. “We wanted to make sure that it didn’t happen to us again and didn’t want to sit back while the bad guys tried to pick us off one by one.”Nearly every state has a law mandating that companies tell customers when their personal data has been compromised. But the laws give companies several weeks to investigate before disclosing a data breach. And there are no rules requiring them to share details about attacks with other businesses. Krebs said there should be.“I think it's great there is some information out there now,"" he said. ""But I think it’s ridiculous that it took a story by a journalist to make that happen."""

Jamie Foxx was reportedly attached to the role of King before DreamWorks and Warner Bros. rejected Stone's latest script. The news marks another wrinkle in the King estate's tight grip on the civil-rights leader's namesake. The studios were working in tandem with the family, who granted the right to use King's copyrighted speeches, but now seems to have raised eyebrows at Stone's approach. The family could damage the credibility and success of the movie if they express disdain. Stone has been criticized for taking factual liberties in his previous historical features, namely 1991's ""JFK,"" which implied that Lyndon B. Johnson staged a coup d'etat prior to President John F. Kennedy's assassination. Still, regardless of what could be seen as the director's iffy credibility, it's clear that the King estate is unwilling to back a biopic that shines any sort of negative light on MLK. Director Paul Greengrass (""United 93,"" ""Captain Phillips"") faced a similar predicament in 2011 with ""Memphis,"" another biopic that mentioned King's alleged extramarital affairs. Universal nixed ""Memphis"" after the estate reportedly told the studio it would condemn the movie if it enters production. (Greengrass has since said the film will ""definitely"" still be made.) Lee Daniels (""Precious,"" ""The Butler"") received the same pressure a few years ago regarding his script for voting-rights docudrama ""Selma,"" which also contained references to sordid details about King's life. ""Middle of Nowhere"" director Ava DuVernay has taken over that project. Deadline.com spoke with one of King's closest confidants, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations Andrew Young, in 2011, after he contacted Universal to refute the claims made in Greengrass' script. When asked why he and the estate refused to submit to the standard warts-and-all approach that is often better received than biopics containing only sycophantic depictions of their subjects, Young said:""My only concern here is honoring the message of Martin Luther King’s life, and how you can change the world without killing anybody. ... It’s not wrong if the warts are there. But we had the most powerful and understanding wives in history: Coretta, my wife Jean, and Ralph Abernathy’s wife Juanita. These women were more dedicated and enthusiastic in pushing us into these struggles than anybody, and the inference Coretta might have been upset about Martin being gone so much or them having marital troubles, it’s just not true. Maybe I’m piqued because nobody read my book, and I tried to be honest, and I was there. We were struggling with history that we didn’t even understand, but somehow by the grace of God it came out right. We were trying to change the world -- not by any means necessary, but by being dedicated to loving our enemies and praying for those who persecuted us.""What do you think of Stone exiting the project?

Vince Gilligan said, ""Listen, I really don't see this happening, but, if it does end up going our way, I'll say something and I'll just send it to you and have you just end it."" So, I had a feeling -- I knew what he was asking me to do. It seemed like a crowd-pleaser. ""Yeah, bitch!"" So, yeah, that's that.Hollis seems like an older guy that we're used to seeing you play. Was that intentional? He's just lived a different life. And Jesse definitely went through his struggles, but Hollis is going through his own set of struggles ... he's different. He's not Jesse Pinkman.Post-""Breaking Bad,"" are you happy with the roles you're being offered? A nice swath of different things? Yeah, it's great.But with a character as popular as Jesse, there's always a danger people would want you to keep doing that. That's why I just say no -- and I do things like ""Hellion."" Have you gotten offers that are too similar? Yeah. A lot of people want me to play -- I mean, great scripts! -- but people that are dealing with drug problems or that sort of thing. It's just kind of like the obvious choice. But, I'm just, for right now -- I'm not saying I'm never going to go down that path 10, 15, 30 years from now -- but I'm saying right now, for me, it would just be idiotic for me to jump onto another Jesse Pinkman-esque type role. And so that's why I try and do something different like ""Hellion"" or like ""Exodus""...Directed by Ridley Scott... Ridley Scott, yeah. And it's biblical, so that's a little different than Jesse as well.I assume ""Need For Speed"" is not biblical. ""Need For Speed"" is not biblical, no. But ""Need for Speed"" is not Jesse Pinkman, either.What should we expect from that character? Well, Tobey Marshall is a guy who runs an auto body shop. He is obsessed with racing -- he lives and breaths it. It's in his blood. His father started this auto body shop -- and his father dies and now he's left with trying to keep his business afloat. He's got his shit together -- not a drug addict. He doesn't do meth; he doesn't kill people. Different.When you were on ""The Price is Right,"" did you have any idea you were going to be called down to contestants' row? No. So it's a complete surprise? Yeah, yeah. But it's not like they're pulling a name out of a hat at random.They want someone who is going to be excited. Yeah, they bring in 10 people at a time and you kind of do an interview process. And that's that. They want people that are excited. And I went there -- you saw -- in a crazy outfit...We've all seen now. I was wearing a crazy outfit and I drank a bunch of Red Bull. I had the most energy of any human being! And they called my name and I think the combination of them calling my name and the combination of the six cans of Red Bull -- I was just teetering on the line of having a heart attack. But, yeah, it was great. Were you surprised when that video became an Internet sensation? No, I was not surprised it became an Internet sensation. That video is crazy. I was surprised that it took that long to surface. Jay Leno -- [sarcastically] bless him -- he's the one that made that happen. When I was a guest on his show, he brought up that video.Mike Ryan is senior writer for Huffington Post Entertainment. You can contact him directly on Twitter."

Species with designated critical habitat are more than twice as likely to show signs of improvement than those without.,2014-01-18,2014-01-16-RS9586_Killer_Whales_Orca_NOAA_FPWCpre.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-01-16-RS9586_Killer_Whales_Orca_NOAA_FPWCpre-thumb.jpg,"Summer's a great time to see the state of Washington's Puget Sound. A sharp-eyed visitor might even catch a glimpse of some of the rarest killer whales on Earth.There are only 81 ""southern resident"" killer whales left the wild. They were on the path toward extinction until a few years ago, when they were protected under the Endangered Species Act.It took some prodding, but in 2006 the federal government protected 2,500 square miles of some of their most important summer habitat in the Puget Sound.Turns out, though, these restless Puget Sound orcas don't stick around in the winter and spring. New research shows that this whale population -- divvied up into three lively pods -- loves to travel, especially in the winter. Last year scientists found that, over the course of just a few months, they cruised from Cape Flattery, at the far northwestern tip of Washington, down along the Oregon Coast to Northern California's Point Reyes. Along the way, these close-knit family groups traveled through more than 9,000 square miles of marine habitat, often in search of migrating salmon at the base of coastal rivers. Now that we know, it only makes sense to protect those migratory areas too.That's why this week, the Center for Biological Diversity petitioned to designate the whales' winter foraging areas along the West Coast as protected ""critical habitat.""Critical habitat designations prevent the federal government from undertaking or approving activities that reduce an area's ability to support an endangered species. Studies show that species with designated critical habitat are more than twice as likely to show signs of improvement than those without.It's clear these killer whales need it.There were once an estimated 200 members of the ""southern population."" The population has endured several significant declines since the 1960s, hitting a low of 67 in 1971. Although the population has shown signs of stabilizing, these whales still face a litany of threats. Human activities in and near coastal waters reduce salmon numbers, generate toxic pollution and increase ocean noise, which disrupts the orcas' ability to communicate and locate prey. All those threats will have to be addressed, but the immediate task should be safeguarding the last remaining places these rare whales need to survive, especially those foraging waters along the coasts of Washington, Oregon and California.Photo: NOAA"

Beaches in Hawaii normally full of visiting tourists as well as local residents, are unusually empty this Easter weekend due to island wide leakages of raw sewage from consecutive weeks of heavy rains. (AP Photo/Ronen Zilberman)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb14ef71f00002501233d12.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Hawaii smells like blooming eucalyptus and fresh salt air, right? Unfortunately, not always. Earlier this week, Hanauma Bay -- a popular Oahu tourist attraction and Obama family favorite -- was closed to the public because of backed up sewer pipes. The Bay draws thousands of tourists a day as a world-famous snorkeling destination, but the site was closed on Thursday for ""emergency maintenance."" Apparently wastewater backup shut down the facility's restrooms and forced the beach's closure for about 90 minutes.Over on the other side of Honolulu, the residents of Kakaako felt Hanauma Bay's pain. As an up and coming neighborhood, Kakaako is undergoing serious growing pains -- mostly in the olfactory system. In response to numerous complaints and questions surrounding Kakaako's stench, the Honolulu City Council was recently forced to report about its causes and potential solutions. Pressure in the sewers, they concluded, was to blame, and they promised that remedies like new devices in manholes would alleviate the odor. But with as many as 30 new buildings being planned in the neighborhood, including several luxury high-rises, many in Honolulu worry that the existing sewer system just isn't up to the task. ""I thought about moving because of the smells,"" Deborah Whisnand, a Kakaako resident told Hawaii News Now back in September. ""You can tell it's sewage smell,"" Regina Torres told KHON2. ""It's very strong, it's hard to breathe at times. If you don't have AC in your car and you're driving by, it'll just hit you.""Honolulu is one of the only major metropolitan areas in the country that does not have a secondary sewage treatment. The city's current system filters the solids and then discharges the wastewater a few miles out in the ocean. But when the wastewater gets backed up, like at Hanauma Bay, or undergoes pressure in the pipes, like in Kakaako, the effects are immediately noticeable. On more than one occasion, the city has been forced to divert wastewater into the Ala Wai canal, which runs through the famous Waikiki, to divert pressure in the system. In compliance with a 2010 settlement with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Honolulu is in the process of installing major overhauls to Oahu's sewage system and the city's mayor promises that they're even ahead of schedule. But the schedule gives the city until 2035 to complete all of the E.P.A.'s requirements, which begs the question: will paradise stink until then?"

Still, he wouldn't rule out an NFL return for Tebow. During an interview on The Damon Amendolara Show on Wednesday, Tannenbaum reflected on some of decisions he made during the end of his seven-year tenure that didn't work out. “I think some of the mistakes we made were from the bottom end of our roster up. So when you lose guys like Jim Leonhard or Danny Woodhead or Jerricho Cotchery, it affects a lot of things, not just what they do on the field, but what they do in the locker room. Obviously we made a couple mistakes, trading for Tim Tebow most notably,"" said Tannenbaum, who was fired after the Jets went 6-10 in 2012 and missed the playoffs.

I'm friends with the monster That's under my bed Get along with the voices inside of my head You're trying to save me Stop holding your breath And you think I'm crazy Yeah, you think I'm crazy Well that's nothingThey are singing and dancing around the kitchen island, and then ""the Bruce Lee of loose leaf,"" Eminem, starts busting his poetic and poignant rhymes. My kids see me and say with huge smiles on their faces, ""Dad, Eminem is singing about the Worry Monster!""It's true, even Eminem knows the monster well, and as a person who has experienced quite a bit of life, he knows that those ""voices"" can be persistent and haunting. He talks about the complexities and challenges of life, as well as the fragility of life and moments -- ""cause you never know when it all could be over.""As Eminem (with Rihanna) tells his story about what the monster tells him and his ""OCD... clonking me in the head,"" he wonders, ""Where these thoughts spawn from?"" That is a very good question and you will get different answers depending upon whom you ask. Neuroscientists say they emerge from electrical impulses or neurotransmitters, and mindfulness practitioners say they just emerge from ""who knows where."" These both seem reasonable to me. However, as Eminem explains, they also seem to come from the ""monster"" that I also know well. The Worry Monster lurks in the shadows and bullies us with his words. He tells us things that limit our confidence and make us fearful to be in the world, or give ourselves a chance to fully experience life and see what we are capable of. The monster pounds on us and our children daily, and with only one goal -- to make us worried and scared.Why do we believe the Worry Monster? Why do we listen to him even when we know what he is saying probably isn't going to happen -- or is it? He turns on the fear center of our brain, our amygdala, so our body goes into survival mode, making us ""fight or flight."" We feel as though we are fighting for our life when we are actually getting ready for a job interview, performance, game or new experience. It is an awful trick monster plays on us, telling us all the bad things that ""may"" happen.Eminem is teaching us about one of the greatest and most powerful things we can do to fight worry and fear -- to become ""friends with the monster."" If we know who and what the monster is, and what he usually tells us to make him feel bad, we can outsmart him and even learn to live with him. The monster likes to visit me at 3:23 am to whisper a bunch of unnecessary things in my ear. It is annoying for sure, but I have learned to expect him and ignore him (most of the time).We are built to survive and our survival responses seem to be overactive for many of us these days, children and adults alike. I don't know anyone who doesn't have a monster who messes with them from time to time. Eminem put his words and experiences out to us as an artist and said, ""...if one kid out of one hundred million who are going through a struggle feels and relates that's great."" My goal for 2014 -- I will join Eminem in putting my experiences and thoughts out there so people can learn they are not alone in feeling worried and scared. We all deal with the monster, some more than others. It's time for you to become ""friends with the monster..."" and show yourself and world what you have to offer.This post originally appeared on PsychologyToday.com."

Mid-century modern style, all completely from scratch and my own measurements - no pre fabricated pieces or drawings/plans.",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9dcb0a2600003600800304.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"With the popularity of MCM (Mid-Century Modern), the tapered leg has had an amazing resurgence in furniture and modern interior design. It's almost impossible to walk into a furniture store and not see at least one piece with tapered legs. Wondering where this vintage style came from and how it made its way back into modern interiors? Even if you're not obsessed with Mid-Century Modern, chances are the tapered leg has touched your style in some way, and will continue to permeate your interiors. Though it's associated with Mid-Century Modern furniture, the tapered leg isn't the invention of 20th-century design genius. Tapering, or a gradual thinning in thickness as legs get closer to the floor, has been a practice of furniture makers since ancient times. This leg style picked up a certain flair in the mid-century and has become a defining feature of Mid-Century Modern furniture.Sometimes a bit more rounded than a classic tapered leg, and frequently set at an angle, Mid-Century Modern tapered legs have a distinct profile shape that instantly marks their vintage. Notice the very round shape of the legs on the mid-century Paul McCobb desk above on the left as compared to the more squared, tapered legs on the early 19th-century, antique desk on the right.Particularly trendy in Mid-Century Modern furniture: short tapered legs that float furniture above the ground -- like the legs on the left side of the McCobb desk, or the petite legs on the walnut dresser above. Short and long, the tapered leg is back and super popular at the moment. A couple of my favorite Mid-Century Modern inspired pieces with stellar legs:Mid-Century Media Console, west elm, $2155 west elm is king of Mid-Century Modern inspired furniture, and this media center is no exception. From the horizontal profile, to the hardware, and of course, the tapered legs, this media console takes inspiration from Mid-Century Modern furniture and bring a vintage edge to modern interiors.Gray Ikat Chair, Furbish Studio, $1500 Looking for a comfortable place to curl up and indulge in a book? This Ikat chair combines worldly fabric with a traditional silhouette and elevated, tapered legs making it a fantastic, eclectic piece. Desk, The Jeremiah Collection, $1190 Not only do I love the shape and style of this desk, but it's handmade in San Francisco by Jeremiah Nielson, which makes it even more amazing. Seriously. Amazing. Jeremiah uses solid wood and artisan techniques to create beautiful pieces inspired by Mid-Century Modern furniture. Have a favorite characteristic of Mid-Century Modern furniture?
