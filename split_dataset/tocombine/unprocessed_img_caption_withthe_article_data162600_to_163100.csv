These establishments, often family-owned, are treasured for their quality food, local character, and lasting appeal.In anticipation of our announcement of the 2013 inductees, we're unlocking the America's Classics vault and checking in on some past winners. First up: South Thomaston, Maine's Waterman's Beach Lobster, which received the award in 2001.  -- Sisters-in-law Sandy Manahan and Lorri Cousens continue to oversee this temple to Maine's unofficial state crustacean. In fact, very little about this classic shoreline shack has changed. Out-of-state visitors and locals still make the summertime pilgrimage to Mussel Ridge Channel in the Penobscot Bay; when they arrive, they order whole lobsters that weigh one to four pounds, depending on what Lorri's husband has caught that day, or they go for lobster rolls, crab rolls, heaps of clams, or even a hot dog. Some head to the beach to dress picnic tables with tablecloths from home and drink bottles of Sauvignon Blanc or Champagne. Others sit under the large covered deck, sipping on sweet tea.While the basic ritual of a visit to Waterman's remains intact, regulars know about a couple of changes. For years Sandy's mother, Anne Manahan (née Waterman), made the restaurant's famed pies. Even when she passed ownership down to her daughters, the ""retired"" restaurateur rose every morning to make the day's desserts. But as Anne neared her 80th birthday, Sandy and Lorri realized they would need to relieve her. With original recipes in hand, they approached a neighbor who had a reputation for baking. They asked the candidate to reproduce each of Waterman's most popular pies, which were then presented for the veteran baker's inspection. After tasting each one, Anne gave her blessing. Post handover, staples like strawberry-rhubarb, made from stalks grown up the road, have remained a customer favorite, and the menu has sprouted homemade ice cream and other seasonal treats. Anne's successor insists on remaining anonymous, lest they be bombarded with requests for raspberry-nectarine crisp.Despite the economy, business has not slowed down at Waterman's, thanks to the swelling numbers of visiting tourists. Still, Waterman's has adjusted its prices so that loyal, in-state patrons can continue to eat there. Their cause was aided by last year's infamous lobster glut, which led to some affordable specials, like a one-pound lobster with butter, chips, and a roll for $10.95. Stay tuned for the James Beard Foundation's announcement of the 2013 America's Classics. Learn more about the James Beard Awards."

Frankly, not all of us possess these attributes in equal measure and the job often seems beyond our means and abilities. The screenings and evaluations, planning and homework support, emotional pep-talks, talking to teachers and administrators, identifying best supports and assessing what is available, navigating legalities, keeping up-to-date on the latest educational interventions and assistive technologies -- all of this leaves most parents feeling depleted and inadequate. As parents of dyslexic children, we also know that the journey should not be so difficult or confusing. Even by conservative estimates, one in ten children is dyslexic. Why should our students have to fail before they qualify for help? Why are so few teachers trained to teach them? Why are the evidence-based programs not being used in every school? Finally, if we know that dyslexia is a condition that responds well to early intervention and prevents children from suffering from a host of other problems, why are public schools not taking a proactive approach? One group of parents in New Jersey decided to do something to address these issues. Just a little over a year ago, twelve parents met in a local library in central New Jersey to launch Decoding Dyslexia-New Jersey. This group came together with the ambitious mission to ""raise dyslexia awareness, empower families to support their children and inform policy-makers on best practices to identify, remediate and support students with dyslexia in NJ public schools."" These parents knew that if they continued to see their challenges as unique and personal, there was a slim chance that the situation for dyslexic children and their families would change. Galvanized by their common struggles, they endeavored to change their state laws so that children like theirs could get the education that they deserved. One should never underestimate a group of determined parents.Over the past year, I have been tracking the progress of Decoding Dyslexia. It has proven to be an inspiring study in commitment, strategy and persistence. This relatively young group can mark their progress with significant state level impact in New Jersey. They have convinced eight New Jersey Representatives to join the U.S. Bi-Partisan Congressional Dyslexia Caucus, have helped publicize the work and recommendations of their state's Reading Disabilities Task Force and are currently working to get six dyslexia-related bills passed in the New Jersey State Assembly and Senate. Most importantly, they have spurred an extraordinary parent movement. Inspired by their inclusive model and success, today, Decoding Dyslexia branches have sprouted up in many states, including CA, VA, TX, CO, CT, AL, WV, OR, FL, KS, PA, MD and WI, and it seems like every few days there is another state to add to the list.As their model goes viral, the New Jersey founders have generously added another arm to their work: offering new state-based groups support and advice gleaned from their own experience. DD-NJ has even written a grassroots guide for other states. I asked Deborah Lynam, one of the original founders of the New Jersey group, what parent groups can learn from their group's initial success. Communication and collaboration are clearly central to their strategy. They have a Facebook, Twitter, and a Yahoo parenting networking site as well as a fully integrated website. However, I was most struck by their guiding philosophy of inclusivity, humility and gratitude. Committed to eliminating any barriers to participating, there are no membership fees or requirements and they try to make the work as accessible as possible for interested parents by creating templates of letters and providing addresses and phone numbers for policy-makers. ""We maintain a positive, motivating attitude and consistently thank parents for their efforts and ideas."" They also understand the importance of celebrating and supporting the work of like-minded organizations, linking with organizations like Learning Ally, The NJ-International Dyslexia Association, The Yale Center for Dyslexia and Creativity and others. Lastly, Deborah cautions, ""We have been careful to communicate that we are not here to do the work for parents and students in NJ. This is a group that needs its members to see their critical role in the success of their work."" As for me, I am sold. With a DD-CA branch just forming, I am eager to take on dyslexia policies in my own state. And as Decoding Dyslexia-USA takes shape, I look forward to pushing for more enlightened national policies as well.Anyone interested in starting a Decoding Dyslexia branch in their state or getting involved in a newly formed group in their state should contact: Info@decodingdyslexianj.org www.decodingdyslexianj.org"

Part booklet, part magazine, not only is it a gastronomic ""look-see"" into the minds of chefs and what they're thinking, but also a good indication of what may be cropping up on menus in your own zip code. Keeping in mind that cooking at the Beard House requires a certain amount of performance art and culinary high-wire acts, the offerings are complex and sometimes over-the-top. Yet, I'm fascinated by the ingredients I've never heard of (yes, I just admitted that), grateful for a new technique or idea, and sometimes baffled by some of the crazy-mixed up combinations. Nonetheless, a read of the menus to be cooked by myriad chefs from all over the country provides an ""instagram"" sweep of America's culinary landscape. There's almost a dinner every day at the Beard House, with chefs telling their stories through the narrative of the menu, somewhere in the USA. First, the ingredients: You'll be seeing mutton, geoduck, banana leaves, lamb tongues, mantequilla enojada (I must look this up), beef heart, gizzards, lotus leaf, finger limes, lotus root, barberries, nettles, cara cara oranges, red verjus, headcheese, shimeji mushrooms, green strawberries, buttermilk, sugar cane, scrapple, lamb neck. A few new ideas: There's ""lambcetta"" (I imagine that's a riff on pancetta but who knows), white barbecue sauce, cold fried chicken torchon, cider aspic, black sesame panna cotta with yuzu, sweet chestnut-filled ravioli with warm English custard, brisket bourguignon (with lamb belly confit and quinoa). Some nice menu language: Foraged mushrooms of the moment, fresh-churned butter, Chocolate Study=Soft, Crunchy, and Nutty. Most curious? Coffee malt crème and soda bread parfait with frozen parsnips. I am struck by the lack of cheese in the dishes or their presence on the menus. Instead most menus were chock-full of mystery words and only a handful showed a kind of elegant restraint. It was refreshing to see the word ""fumet.""What does it all mean? Some of the wanton (not wonton!) creativity that began in the 1970s was expressed on menus in language that read like shopping lists, where every ingredient in a dish was revealed. The trend continues today. And while it is a way for chefs to differentiate themselves from others, the menus have a sense of gastronomic sameness -- with little sense of place, identity or ethnicity. This is merely an observation and not a judgment for it is what we have come to expect of our chefs and their menus. ""Wow me,"" we say. And for the most part, this is what the chefs are doing. Frozen parsnips, anyone?If you're lucky enough to be in New York in March or April, or anytime really, you should try one of the Beard House dinners.

5,DIVORCE,Top Five Questions Asked About Divorce,"Natalie Gregg, Contributor
Divorce Lawyer, Entrepreneur, Mother of Two",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/top-five-questions-asked_us_5b9cd2dce4b03a1dcc8225f4,One of the heaviest doors to open is the one that leads into your first meeting with a divorce lawyer.,2013-02-21,"Two separate wedding rings next to the word ""divorce""",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cd2dc3c0000320009ea06.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One of the heaviest doors to open is the one that leads into your first meeting with a divorce lawyer. In addition to all of the emotional stress that you carry, there are a seemingly endless number of questions that fill your mind about the path that you are about to travel.As an attorney who is exclusively focused on the practice of family law, I have met with hundreds of clients who have been in this exact situation. I believe that one of my primary roles during this initial consultation is to simply inform them about the divorce process so that they can prepare for the journey ahead.Below are general answers to some of the top questions that I have received from people during these first consults. This list neither constitutes nor is intended to be legal advice. Please be advised that if you need legal counsel, you should consult an attorney regarding your individual situation.  1. How much is this going to cost? Answer: The choice is yours -- do you want to send your attorney's kids to college or your own? I have seen clients with similar cases spend anywhere from $2,500 to well over $40,000 just for attorney fees and court costs. There are no guarantees because some divorcing spouses are ruthless, or they hire law firms that treat their cases more like money machines than real families in transition. While you cannot control the former, you can ensure that you entrust your case to an attorney who will resolve the divorce for a reasonable fee and in a reasonable amount of time. When hiring an attorney, you should always ask for full information about their retainer policy, fee structure and billing practices before hiring them. And if you walk into a firm with a beautiful skyline view, armies of attentive staffers and gorgeous furniture, you better enjoy it... because you are the one paying for all of that.  2. How long is this going to take? Answer: Divorce can take as little as 60 days or more than a full year. You are in the driver's seat, but the other side may drag it out. There also might be strategic reasons that you intentionally delay the process (i.e. you might be in the middle of liquidating a major asset or there could be a simultaneous criminal proceeding whose ruling will affect your case). Particularly in hotly contested cases, it is very important to take time to get the order correct in the initial decree, because the opposing party is likely to file for a modification in the future. Unless circumstances have significantly changed (i.e. job loss or new criminal proceedings), these modifications rarely make substantial changes from the initial decree.  3. This should be simple. Do I really need a lawyer? Answer: There are no simple cases -- unless you are willing to lose everything. Many attorneys advertise ""flat fee"" divorces, but you get what you pay for. Even if you are a fellow family lawyer, I would advise hiring an attorney. Would you operate on your own arm if it were broken? The forms at the courthouse are adequate for you to represent yourself, but a bad divorce decree is hard to undo. It can be much more expensive to pay an attorney to mop up the spills of a bad pro se case than to simply hire a competent family lawyer in the first place.  4. Do I have to go to court? Answer: It depends on the result that you want and how badly you want it. It also depends on your spouse's position. To avoid court, both parties need to take reasonable positions so that they can settle outside of court in mediation or collaborative law, which will save them both a lot of stress, time and money. But if either party is looking at the process as a way to ""get back"" at the other spouse, or if either party is crazy (especially over money), you are destined to be sitting in the hot seat of the witness box. And if your spouse has hired a powerhouse firm that needs to cover their overhead and bloated costs, then you may find yourself in court so much that you start to memorize the cafeteria menu and say goodbye to the security guards, who are now your friends.  5. What happens if we get back together -- did I just waste all of my money? Answer: In my ten years of practice and more than 600 closed cases, this has only happened twice. So, while you might be in that one-third of one-percent, chances are that you are not wasting your money. However, just to make you feel better, most retainers are fully refundable per the Professional Code (at least mine is). So, you are covered."
6,DIVORCE,Grandparenting Step-Grandchildren,"Marsha Temlock, Contributor
Author, Your Child’s Divorce: What to Expect – What You Can Do",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/grandparenting-stepgrandc_us_5b9cccf6e4b03a1dcc81fb7d,"Whether you like it or not, when an adult son or daughter remarries, you are going to inherit a bunch of new relatives -- and their problems.",2013-02-21,Little girl whispering her grandfather a secret to ear - outdoor in backyard,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9cccf6240000500094d3ae.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Whether you like it or not, when an adult son or daughter remarries, you are going to inherit a bunch of new relatives -- and their problems. Remarriage is difficult for the couple. What many people don't realize is how tough it is on grandparents who have the daunting and gratifying job of establishing relationships with step-grandchildren. It is pretty common to hear the term blended families, which is a misnomer. You cannot put people in a blender and expect them to homogenize -- especially when it comes to adding kids to the family soup.Many grandparents talk about the difficulties of being accepted. If a grandchild or step-grandchild resents the remarriage, you are automatically the target of that anger. My suggestion to grandparents is to keep trying without going overboard. Use some humor. If everything fails, try backing off until the child has sorted out his issues. It may take some time for him to figure out that you are part of the game plan and not so horrible, after all.It's possible your step-grandchild is unhappy because the kid has had to make all kinds of sacrifices. It might help to acknowledge how hard he's trying by saying something like, ""I'm very proud of you for sharing your room with Mike,"" or ""I know it's not easy moving to a new middle school but I think it's great you made the swim team.""As for being empathetic, I wouldn't advise buddying-up a step-grandchild too soon if your role is not yet assured. You are like an invited guest. To be successful, first earn the respect of the parent and the rest may follow.Some kids do better accepting the new grandparent(s) than others. Children between ten and fourteen years old usually have the most difficulty adjusting to their parent's remarriage. Younger children might be more flexible. Older kids look forward to leaving home and have their peers for support. If an older child is really unhappy with the situation, he may have the option of choosing to live with the other biological parent. Let's face it: some kids are lovable and some are not. More than one grandparent has inherited a grandkid acting out with purple hair and body piercing. The wise grandparent looks beyond the tattoos and remembers that beauty is only skin-deep. Certainly, there has got to be some common ground. Be tolerant; most kids want to be accepted. If it is too difficult to get past obnoxious behavior, keep in mind your son or daughter is more than likely struggling with the same problem. The last thing anyone needs is a critical grandparent to wreck a marriage.Up until now I've focused on the difficulties grandchildren have reshuffling the family. Fortunately, there are many situations when children are thrilled to have the security of a stable unit. New grandparents to indulge them -- what's bad about that? I've talked to grandparents who wouldn't think of calling their inherited grandkids step-grandkids. To them, blood is not thicker than water.Case in point: I will never forget the grandparent who talked about her pain when she learned her son's second marriage was falling apart. ""The worst was when my five-year-old step-grandson, overhearing my son and his mother talk about getting divorced, took me aside and asked, 'Does that mean I can't have you for my grandma anymore?'""Today the roots of the family seem to be growing further and further away from the tree trunk. There are millions of households containing at least one stepchild and that makes for millions of step-grandparents. Seniors can help cement their son or daughter's remarriage by accepting the new constellation and doing what they can by making children who are trying to adjust to the changes feel accepted and loved."
