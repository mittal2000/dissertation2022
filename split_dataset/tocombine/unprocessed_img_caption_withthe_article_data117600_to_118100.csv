3,CRIME,"Could a LA-Style Threat Assessment Team Have Thwarted the Isla Vista, Seattle or Oregon Shooting Sprees?","Art Levine, ContributorContributing Editor, The Washington Monthly",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/could-a-la-style-threat-a_b_5518901.html,"the department still grapples with the reality that at least half of seriously mentally ill people receive no treatment at all, a situation of possible danger to the entire community and, far more often, to themselves.",2014-06-22,2014-06-22-ElliotRodgercollegecommunityshooting.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2014-06-22-ElliotRodgercollegecommunityshooting-thumb.jpg,"When Richard Martinez, the father of a young man killed in the Isla Vista, CA attacks, came to Washington last week to bring his gun control message of ""Not One More"" raised by the recent spate of mass shootings, it was actually a sad reminder of how little the polarized federal government is willing to do about either guns or our failed mental health system. In fact, a few hours after that May shooting rampage by Elliot Rodger that left seven people dead, Rep. Tim Murphy (R-PA) drew attention to his controversial mental health reform bill that has now stalled in Congress, due in part to its emphasis on involuntary treatment. He declared, ""How many more people must lose their lives before we take action on addressing cases of serious mental illness?""But in Los Angeles County, psychiatric nurse Linda Boyd and the law enforcement-linked outreach teams she leads aren't waiting for Congress. Instead, she worked out of her cramped Department of Mental Health (DMH) office in the days after the shooting coordinating the department's efforts to reach out to nearly 100 possibly dangerous young people who've made threats in the last several years that they've been monitoring. The department also reaches out to the young people's families and the professionals treating them.It is the nation's most sophisticated, collaborative program involving law enforcement, school and mental health staff. The School Threat Assessment Response Team Program (START), launched in 2007 after the Virginia Tech massacre, is believed to haveprevented more than 50 imminent school and campus attacks and screened more than 5,000 people, mostly students.Boyd explained, ""We realized we needed to do something about the threats people are making, and we do whatever intervention is needed."" The START team coordinates multi-agency threat assessments that include a scanning of social media; a weapons ownership check; and interviews with the potentially dangerous person andthe key people who know the individual and have treated him or her. For those deemed ill or dangerous, that is generally followed by voluntary services that can be intensive, including regular at-home visits. Short-term involuntary psychiatric ""holds"" are initially invoked about 40 percent of the time for those assessed as dangerous. They then typically enroll in the voluntary services in part because they know that their progress and behaviors are now being tracked.Could this approach have prevented Elliott Rodger from his shooting spree, given that local police were contacted by his alarmed therapist a month before the tragedy? Police had even interrogated him after he was attacked trying to push women off a ledge.""Absolutely,"" says J. Kevin Cameron, a pioneer of multi-agency, data-based threat investigations at the Canadian Center for Threat Assessment and Trauma Response. Cameron has served as a consultant to LA County's mental health department and school district. He's appalled that Santa Barbara sheriff's deputies showed up at Rodger's home and, based on a short talk with him at his front door, concluded that he was ""perfectly polite"" and posed no danger.""They relied on their friggin' 'feelings,'"" he said, ""instead of relying on the data."" Based on the information available through a START-style investigation, he believes mental health workers or police would have had enough evidence to place Rodger under a ""probable cause"" temporary psychiatric hold. That, in turn, would have allowed police to bar him from owning weapons for five years.If those assessment practices were in place in Santa Barbara, Cameron says, ""there's no question that this particular case would have had a different trajectory."" Based on emerging news accounts on the suspects, those strategies might also have spotted warning signs from the killers in the recent Oregon and Seattle shootings that could have arranged for effective treatment and potentially seized their weapons  -- a little-used power under many state laws involving seriously mentally ill people who have been committed. For example, years before Aaron Ybarra's June 5th spree in Seattle that killed one person, the threat he posed wasn't fully assessed or responded to after a counselor reported that he heard the voices of a Columbine killer telling him to hurt people and he was involuntarily hospitalized twice , starting as a college student in 2010.After the Isla Vista shootings, for instance, the Los Angeles START team acted to prevent potential copycat attacks and to respond to new threats. On the first Tuesday after the shootings, a high-school student, assigned a personal essay, stood up in a suburban Los Angeles school and read a rant about his desire to kill people in the school. School officials summoned two specially trained social workers from the START program to evaluate him. After a targeted school violence assessment, he was taken involuntarily to a local hospital for a 72-hour observation.More typically, the team made sure to check on the young people they were already aiding. One of its clients is an over-18-year-old student with autism and a mood disorder. He had been expelled from a local community college after threatening an administrator and talking in detail about famous school violence incidents. Later, he flouted a restraining order against visiting the campus. But these days he is doing well, thanks to treatment over the last year and regular at-home social work visits. Best of all, the same college that expelled him was now willing to take him back in a technology certificate program. But family pressures -- led by a relative determined to see him get a four-year college degree - have kept him unsettled.He was one of four clients discussed during a recent three-hour weekly meeting of the START team and other outreach workers attended by this reporter. The team learned during a social worker's home visit that the former college student had angrily pushed his relative, a sign of new threatening behavior against his family. A therapist advising the START team responded to this news: ""In a perfect storm if all the bad elements line up, he's liable to attack [her] or choke her, with all that rage."" The therapist viewed the college administrator as another potential high-risk target.Another client discussed at the meeting was contacted after the Isla Vista shooting -- ""patient"" is widely considered a stigmatizing slur -- because he was potentially truly dangerous. He is a teenager who had violent hallucinatory fantasies about killing himself and his schoolmates. His actual behavior hadn't originally set off alarm bells even after he showed up at an event on campus with a bandolier packed with real bullets. But after telling his disturbing hallucinations to his psychiatrist, the doctor reported the threats to police under a ""duty to warn"" law. This led to the student being placed on an observational hold in a hospital. He also violated a restraining order barring him from any school in his town. Placed on probation, he eventually was referred to intensive social work and psychiatric care from the county's ""Full Service Partnership"" team for youth and young adults.The probation ruling provided an added incentive for getting him involved in treatment, staff psychologist Pietro Diengello noted. ""The beauty of this combo of law enforcement and mental health is you can prioritize the mental health care,"" he said. ""It's not punitive, it's help-based.""The student has made considerable progress. But he's living with a relative who doesn't believe in professional therapy. She's recently stopped taking him to sessions, Boyd learned when she contacted a DMH team clinician. ""He's going to need a new home visit,"" Boyd observed. ""He wants to engage with us, and we can help him with whatever he needs.""START's success is a challenge to the conventional thinking and political debates about mental illness and violence. It's commonly argued by academic researchers that violence by people with mental illness is extremely rare: only four percent of all violent acts are committed by those with a mental disorder. People with mental illness are 11 times more likely to be victims than perpetrators.Many experts also insist it's virtually impossible to predict or prevent violence beforehand. As one psychiatry professor, Olav Niellsen of the University of Sydney, concluded, ""The extreme rarity of these events means that identification of individual patients who might kill a stranger is not possible.""As nurse Boyd scrolled through a Power-Point presentation on the warning signs the START program uses, she might have cause to disagree. She pulls up the disturbing photos of some of the country's most notorious mass murderers, including Jared Loughner of the Tucson shootings and Seung-Hui Cho, who killed 32 people at Virginia Tech. ""So what do they have in common?"" she asked. ""They all intersected with law enforcement, mental health and schools beforehand, but nobody ever connected the dots.""After displaying the weapons stash of Adam Lanza from the Newtown, CT. massacre, she shows some of the frightening writings and drawings the team has seen in student backpacks and lockers. Particularly troubling was the vivid calligraphy and drawings of a teenager who created a booklet called, ""1,000 ways to kill yourself,"" noting, ""I just want the pain to end."" His drawings included a boy hanging from a noose and a girl being cut in half with a chain saw. Yet Boyd noted, ""He's really talented, and we got him help. Now he's in an art college and he sees a future now,"" augmented by psychiatric care.The START presentation shows the weapons caches they've found -- sawed-off shotguns, knives, a hatchet, even explosives. ""There's a pathway to violence,"" she said. ""They're stacking up grievances."" The START team's job is to discover, disrupt and offer help to those who are going down that road.Despite the team's successful approach, no national mental health organization champions it. That's because the program doesn't fit into either side of the intensely ideological debate over the efficacy of mandated outpatient commitments. The program's generally voluntary providing of services, for example, undercuts the way mandated ""Assisted Outpatient Treatment"" is being sold politically as the best mental health solution to violent rampages. But a prominent researcher who has studied the cost-effectiveness of such involuntary treatment,Duke University psychiatry professor, Dr. Marvin Swartz, has declared, ""Outpatient commitment isn't going to prevent mass shootings."" The approach also challenges the claims by the Santa Barbara County Sheriff's Department that there was little that they could do to prevent Rodger's rampage.The START team is part of an array of department outreach services including mobile crisis teams and nearly 40 joint police-clinician patrol teams deployed in Los Angeles and across the county each day. Ten more will be added soon. All told, the various teams reach more than 21,000 people a year, usually summoned through 911 and hotline calls.Their empathetic approach to psychiatric crises generally doesn't inflict trauma and avoids the deadly violence that too often accompanies encounters in other locales. More than just improved crisis intervention training for police, Los Angeles County's pioneering policing approach to this issue, launched in 1993, has sparked interest from other communities in the wake of the ruthless beating death in 2011 of a homeless man with schizophrenia by two Fullerton, California policemen. Their acquittal this year sparked new outrage.Unfortunately that victim, Kelly Thomas, never got a chance to interact with professionals like the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Mental Evaluation Team (MET) members. I rode with two of them in an unmarked police car during a recent daytime shift. The pair -- -- we'll call the nurse Marjorie and the deputy Gail because of confidentiality concerns -- usually are called as mental health backup for the police first responders. They're also trained in START evaluations and aren't swayed by deceptively polite encounters.Today, they're summoned when a distraught mother called 911 after her teenage daughter with bipolar disorder exploded in a dangerous rage. The girl erupted in anger when her mother said she couldn't afford to buy the teenager Pro-Active acne cream that day. The girl threw her skateboard through the window. ""She went nuclear,"" the mother tells Marjorie. ""I felt scared and called the police.""The nurse, reviewing the medications the girl stopped taking regularly after she turned 18, did more than triage. She also offered reassurance and useful information, including a National Alliance on Mental Illness brochure on family support programs. Outside, Gail gently maneuvered the handcuffed girl into the car to go to a hospital for a 72-hour psychiatric hold. Still on her family's insurance, the girl complained, ""I'm going to have pay for medication. It's too expensive!"" Something remarkable occurred inside the black patrol car: the easygoing Gail quietly chatted with the girl and learned secrets the teen hadn't even told her mother. Winning the teen's consent, Gail disclosed that the girl wasn't taking her medication because she was trying to get pregnant by her boyfriend, who has schizophrenia. Marjorie advised her: ""You have an illness, like diabetes, and you need to take your medication.""By the time they arrived at the emergency room, waiting for intake, Gail began schmoozing with the girl about make-up. ""How do you get your eyebrows like that?"" the cop asked. Soon they were joking together and the deputy took off the handcuffs. As the MET team prepared to leave while the hospital arranged for a psychiatric exam, Marjorie told her, ""Don't worry about the money, worry about feeling better. That's why you're here.""But by the end of their shift, the pair wondered aloud about the long-term value of their work. ""I've made them safer for a day or two,"" Marjorie mused, ""but we see the same people over and over again.""There is no guarantee that the teen, for instance, will follow any of the treatment plan arranged for her when she's released. Ironically, privately insured individual treatment for serious mental illness -- as Elliot Rodger received -- often doesn't produce the results that public mental health programs can at their best. In part that's because those in Los Angeles County have developed a way to engage people voluntarily in in-depth services that go well beyond therapy alone. The approach has cut hospitalization rates, incarceration and homelessness by up to 80 percent or more for those lucky enough to receive them.The reform-minded director of the county mental health department, Marvin Southard, proclaims, ""We have a 'whatever it takes' philosophy."" But the department still grapples with the reality that at least half of seriously mentally ill people receive no treatment at all, a situation of possible danger to the entire community and, far more often, to themselves.Art Levine, a Contributing Editor of The Washington Monthly in Washington, D.C., is researching the treatment of mental illness in America under an Alicia Patterson Foundation fellowship.

In his China Daily interview, Hatoyama further said that improving cooperative relations with China and not isolating itself through its actions was a high priority because “there will be a day when Japan places the same emphasis on its relations with China as it does on the US today.”Despite mounting pessimism over the crisis, the former prime minister professed “faith in the possibility” that the relationship will be repaired. “At this point in time, friendship tells its own value.”"

In the latest effort to recognize the increasing numbers of Latin American baseball players, an advocacy group wants Major League Baseball to retire Roberto Clemente's No. 21 by next year's All-Star Game in Pittsburgh. Clemente died at age 38 on Dec. 31, 1972, when a plane loaded with relief supplies for victims of a Nicaraguan earthquake crashed shortly after takeoff from San Juan, Puerto Rico. (AP Photo)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb7e853240000500098aaa1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"(RNS) Richard Rossi is on a crusade of sorts, traveling to cities across the country to collect stories about the fabled healing powers of baseball great Roberto Clemente.His goal? Nothing short of making Clemente an officially recognized Catholic saint.“He had a calling to be a great baseball player,” Rossi said, “but he had a calling beyond baseball.”Clemente played right field for the Pittsburgh Pirates from 1955-1972. He reached 3,000 hits and won the National League MVP trophy in 1966.On Dec. 31, 1972, Clemente boarded a flight in San Juan, Puerto Rico, to ferry relief supplies to earthquake victims in Nicaragua. Soon after takeoff, the plane crashed, killing Clemente and four others.Rossi was only 9 years old when Clemente died but remembers going to Pirates games for $1 with his father. Since then, Rossi said he’s read almost everything written on Clemente and talked with many more people who knew him.After talking to several people, including a nun, Rossi said, he learned the religious side to Clemente had been left out of most biographies. So, Rossi, a 51-year-old Catholic and independent filmmaker in Hollywood, made it one of the bigger parts in his movie, “Baseball’s Last Hero: 21 Clemente Stories.”Now, Rossi and a group of volunteers are listening to people’s stories about Clemente, and they’re using the scientific tools of X-rays and medical records to verify tales of Clemente’s miraculous healing touch.Under normal circumstances, miracles are considered much later in the process, after the church has officially opened a sainthood cause. Catholic teaching says miracles attributed to a saint — two are needed for canonization, after his or her death — are evidence that the person has God’s ear in heaven.“One reason the Catholic Church has lasted a couple of thousand years, it has this kind of process, they’re very slow and so we want to make sure we present something that, you know, has a lot of credible evidence,” Rossi said.Rossi already has several supporters on his side, including Duane Rieder, executive director of the Clemente Museum in Pittsburgh.Rieder said he has spent time talking to family, friends and nuns who knew Clemente; they say he predicted his own death through dreams of him dying in the ocean and his body not being found.But Rieder said he feels that the most important part is not the way Clemente died, but the way he lived his life for others.“He’s the only true baseball hero. He’s the only person, player that ever gave up his life helping other people. Everybody else, you know, Babe Ruth wasn’t a hero. He was a hell of a baseball player,” Rieder said. “Roberto Clemente was the only true baseball hero.”Rossi is also looking for support from bishops, including Archbishop Roberto Gonzalez Nieves of San Juan — and even Pope Francis.“The purpose of my writing is to humbly ask your blessing my efforts to defend the beginning of the canonization of Puerto Rican athlete humanitarian Roberto Clemente,” the letter says. As the archbishop of San Juan, Nieves would have to sign off on Clemente’s sainthood cause and move the process along to the Vatican. The Archdiocese of San Juan did not respond to repeated requests for comment.Rossi also hopes to meet with Pope Francis and show him his movie. “I think he is the perfect pope for this — No. 1, being Latin American. But No. 2, he thinks outside the box.”Carmen Nanko-Fernandez, a Latina theologian at Chicago Theological Union, is writing a book about Clemente, “El Santo! Baseball and the Canonization of Roberto Clemente.” She said anything is possible with Pope Francis, but due to a canonization process that can stretch on for centuries, she isn’t so sure Clemente will make the cut.“All evidence seems to point to that Clemente was a good guy who tried to lived his life well. So in that sense, you know, does he have a chance at being considered a saintly person? Sure,” she said. “Will that make him into the canonization process that makes him an officially recognized saint in the Catholic Church? I’m not so sure.”But Nanko-Fernandez said Hispanic Catholics can continue to venerate and honor him, making him an unofficial saint.“It’s not necessary for one to become an official saint to be considered a saint,” Nanko-Fernandez said.For Rossi, Clemente is needed as a saint for “ordinary” people to look up to. Clemente lived his life for others and died in service to the poor, Rossi said, and what could be more saintly than that?“When we look at the process of canonization, unfortunately, it’s very weighted towards celibate people that choose the vocations of being a priest or nun,” Rossi said. “I mean, there’s a very small percentage that walk it out in the real world as a family-first man, as a husband, as a father, in a secular culture, as a baseball star.” "

Once you hit midlife, losing those final five pounds just becomes near-impossible for many people. It turns out, it may not be your dieting commitment as much as other factors -- including some environmental ones. Here are five reasons why science says you may be struggling:You don't sleep well. Sleep, it turns out, is the easiest way to lose weight. We've all been there: After a restless night of tossing and turning, we wake up exhausted and crave fuel for our bodies. As we start to nod off all day long, what do we do? Grab for food to give us a jolt. Ah, if only we had slept well.WebMD says there are dozens of studies that say people who sleep less tend to weigh more. In one study that lasted 16 years, almost 70,000 women were followed. The results: Those who slept five hours or less a night were nearly a third more likely to gain 30 pounds or more than women who slept seven hours per night.Sleep deprivation actually changes your basal metabolic rate, which means it slows down how many calories you burn from doing those basic life-sustaining activities, like breathing and maintaining body temperature. Combine that with your body's craving for additional ""fuel"" on the day after a bad night's sleep and there you have it.Solution to those final five may lie in your bed. Get a good night's sleep!You are exercising too much instead of eating less. Sure we all know that weight loss is a combination of dieting and exercise. But science says it's more the dieting part. Decreasing food intake is much more efficient than increasing physical activity to lose weight. Think of it like this: You can not eat one bag of chips for 300 calories or you can run for half an hour.To be fair, you really do have to do both. But for the final five, maybe try a little less intake? And just a caution: Science also has shown that exercising a lot can actually stimulate your appetite.You don't wash your fruits and vegetables. Pesticides on your fresh produce contain substances that increasingly have been linked to obesity and weight gain. The effects that environmental toxins have on weight actually begin very early in life. Recent studies have linked exposure to environmental pollutants while in the womb with being overweight and having excessive body mass index later in life. As you age, your metabolism slows and it's harder to lose weight. Scientists have long noted that just the act of losing weight also slows our metabolisms. This excessive slowdown is called ""adaptive thermogenesis,"" and researchers say it seems to occur because of increased concentrations of pollutants in the blood.Jumpstart your diet by washing all produce thoroughly and trying to buy organic when you can. And some swear by detoxes as a component of successful dieting.You keep leftovers in plastic. BPA -- bisphenol A -- is an industrial chemical that has been around since the 1960s. It's in your water bottle, your storage containers, what you wrap leftovers in to keep them fresh. It also may be an enemy of the final 5 as it impacts your metabolism. According to the Mayo Clinic, there is research showing that BPA can seep into food or beverages from those containers made with BPA. While the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says BPA is safe at the low levels that occur in foods, others are more skeptical. The fight over the safety of plastics isn't new. As Mother Jones noted in this investigative piece published a few months ago, way back in 1987 they were discussing how BPA impacts the endocrine system -- the network of glands that controls metabolism.Simplest solution: Ditch the plastic in favor of glass or products marked ""no BPA."" AARP, which recently ran a post on the topic, adds this tip: Wash your hands frequently when you're at work; toxic compounds known as PBDEs are often found in office furniture and carpeting. Your thermostat is set too high. While it's hard to fathom this being the case of a menopausal woman experiencing hot flashes, your room temperature may be too high. Lowering the thermostat helps your body produce a hormone that stimulates the growth of something called brown fat. Don't worry; brown fat is your friend. It keeps your organs warm by burning calories, which is a good thing. Brown fat tends to disappear with age, which is not such a good thing.According to AARP's story, ""Lowering your thermostat from 75 to 68 degrees stimulates brown fat and increases calorie burn by 100 calories a day."" A little less optimism came from the New York Times when it reported on the brown fat study. The paper quoted Dr. André Carpentier, an endocrinologist at the University of Sherbrooke in Quebec and lead author of one of the new papers, as saying, ""As for deliberately making yourself cold if you want to lose weight, there is still a lot of research to do before this strategy can be exploited clinically and safely.” Party pooper, that one."

Iraqi security forces battled insurgents targeting the countryâs main oil refinery and said they regained partial control of a city near the Syrian border Wednesday, trying to blunt a weeklong offensive by Sunni militants who diplomats fear may have also seized some 100 foreign workers. (AP Photo via militant video)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc138f82400004f0024e780.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"ANBAR, Iraq June 21 (Reuters) - Sunni fighters have seized a border post on the Iraq-Syria frontier, security sources said, smashing a line drawn by colonial powers a century ago in a campaign to create an Islamic Caliphate from the Mediterranean Sea to Iran.The militants, led by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), first moved into the nearby town of al-Qaim on Friday, pushing out security forces, the sources said on Saturday.Once border guards heard that al-Qaim had fallen, they left their posts and militants moved in, the sources said.Sameer al-Shwiali, media adviser to the commander of Iraq's anti-terrorist squad, told Reuters the Iraqi army was still in control of al-Qaim.Al-Qaim and its neighboring Syrian counterpart Albukamal are on a strategic supply route. A three-year-old civil war in Syria has left most of eastern Syria in the hands of Sunni militants, now including the Albukamal-Qaim crossing.The Albukamal gate is run by al Qaeda's official Syria branch, the Nusra Front, which has clashed with ISIL but has sometimes agreed to localized truces when it suits both sides.The head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group, Rami Abdulrahman, said ISIL had pushed the Nusra Front out from many areas of eastern Syria in the past few days and their capture of al-Qaim will allow them to quickly move to the Syrian side.ISIL already controls territory around the Albukamal gate, effectively pinching the Nusra Front between its forces in Syria and those in neighboring Iraq, said Abdulrahman, who tracks the violence.The al Qaeda offshoot has captured swathes of territory in northwest and central Iraq, including the second city, Mosul. They have seized large amounts of weaponry from the fleeing Iraqi army and looted banks.World powers are deadlocked over the crises in Iraq and Syria. Shi'ite Iran has said it will not hesitate to protect Shi'ite shrines if asked by Baghdad but Sunni-run Saudi Arabia has warned Tehran to stay out of Iraq.U.S. President Barack Obama has offered up to 300 U.S. special forces advisers to help the Iraqi government recapture territory seized by ISIL and other Sunni armed groups across northern and western Iraq.But he has held off granting a request for air strikes to protect the government and renewed a call for Iraq's long-serving Shi'ite prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki, to do more to overcome sectarian divisions that have fueled resentment among the Sunni minority.SHI'ITES MOBILIZEThe fighting has divided Iraq along sectarian lines. The Kurds have expanded their zone in the northeast to include the oil city of Kirkuk, which they regard as part of Kurdistan, while Sunnis have taken ground in the west.The government has mobilized Shi'ite militia to send volunteers to the front lines.In Baghdad's Shi'ite slum of Sadr City, thousands of fighters wearing military fatigues marched through the streets.They carried rocket-propelled grenades, semi-automatic rifles and trucks had mounted long-range rockets, including the new 3-meter ""Muqtada 1"" missile, named after Shi'ite cleric Muqtada Sadr, who has tens of thousands of followers.Sadr has yet to throw his fighters into the recent wave of fighting but has accused Maliki of mishandling the crisis.""These brigades are sending a message of peace. They are the brigades of peace. They are ready to sacrifice their souls and blood for the sake of defending Iraq and its generous people,"" a man on a podium said as the troops marched by. SUNNI INFIGHTINGThe fighting, with strong sectarian overtones, is pushing the country towards civil war.Iraq's largest refinery, Baiji, 200 km (130 miles) north of the capital near Tikrit, has been transformed into a battlefield.""Last night, three attacks on Baiji refinery were repelled and attackers ... More than 70 terrorists were killed and more than 15 vehicles were destroyed,"" said Major-General Qassim al-Moussawi, spokesman for the Iraqi military's commander-in-chief.He showed aerial footage of cars and people being blown up but details of the fighting could not be independently confirmed.The conflict has displaced tens of thousands. On Saturday evening, 15 people were wounded by a army helicopter strike in the village of Al Bu Saif, south of Mosul city, medics said.A health official in Mosul said the wounded included two children and seven women. ""Most of them are from the same family. Three are in critical condition from shrapnel wounds,"" he said.As in Syria, ISIL has started to clash with other Sunni militias in Iraq. In the town of Hawija, ISIL and members of the Naqshbandi Army, made up of former army officers as well as loyalists of Saddam Hussein's former ruling Baath party, started fighting on Friday evening, witnesses said.They said the clashes, in a dispute over power, killed 15 people.""Hawija is falling apart,"" a senior tribal figure from the community said before the clashes. ""There are so many groups working with ISIL. Each group has its agenda.""Hawija could be seen as the spark for Iraq's current armed Sunni insurgency. In April 2013, Sunni protesters said security forces shot dead at least 50 of them. They were demanding greater rights from the Shi'ite-led government. After the killings, violence soared in Iraq.

""There were no losses to Ukrainian servicemen. The number of dead fighters is being established"".Poroshenko, announcing the week-long ceasefire on Friday night, urged the rebels to lay down their arms and warned them that Ukrainian forces would return fire if attacked. AIR BASEUkrainian forces also repelled two attacks by around 50 heavily-armed fighters in the early morning on an air defense base at Avdiyivka, which houses surface-to-air missiles, the defense ministry said separately. No Ukrainian personnel were hurt and rebel losses were being established, it added.The rebels, who have seized strategic points in major towns including Donetsk and set up ""people's republics"", saying they want to join Russia, said Ukraine has broken its own ceasefire.""I've spoken to our commander-in-chief, Igor Strelkov. He said that fighting resumed in the morning. There is no ceasefire at all,"" Pavel Gubarev, a prominent rebel leader, told Rossiya-24 TV channel.Either Ukrainian troops were not obeying Poroshenko, or ""he is lying"", Gubarev said.Poroshenko, installed on June 7 as president after seven months of turmoil in the ex-Soviet republic, ordered government forces to cease firing to allow his 15-point peace plan to take root. The ceasefire ends at 10 p.m. on June 27.The insurgency in the Russian-speaking east erupted in April after street protests in the capital Kiev toppled the Moscow-backed Viktor Yanukovich. Russia subsequently annexed Ukraine's Crimean peninsula.Poroshenko is gearing up for a diplomatic push to sell his plan but his biggest challenge will be to win over Russian President Vladimir Putin. Relations with Moscow are at rock bottom and Kiev accuses Moscow of fomenting the unrest.Poroshenko has offered an amnesty to separatists who disarm voluntarily as well as corridors to allow fighters from Russia or pro-Russian Ukrainian separatists to leave safely for Russia.The Kremlin on Friday denounced the ceasefire as an ultimatum rather than a peace offering and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov expressed concern about Ukrainian military action.""It is disturbing and raises concerns that, simultaneously with this (ceasefire) announcement...the so-called anti-terrorist operation is increasing,"" Interfax quoted him as saying during a visit to Saudi Arabia.Ukraine, for its part, expressed concern on Saturday about an increase in Russian movements near the border.""The continuing concentration of Russian armed forces and their heightened activity near the border with Ukraine causes special concern against a background of numerous facts that confirm weapons and military equipment are being supplied to the terrorists,"" Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. REBELS DEFIANTIn Donetsk about 100 troops of the self-styled separatist Donetsk People's Republic took an oath of an allegiance, in an apparent sign of defiance to Porosheko's peace plan.In a ceremony on the town's Lenin Square, armed fighters, some wearing face masks, pledged they would ""defend the Donetsk People's Republic to the last drop of blood.""""We swear, we swear, we swear,"" they chanted in unison.Alexei, a miner, said he decided to take up arms last week: ""I am 43. I have children. I had a job but I dropped everything to defend the homeland.""A number of women, many in tears, rushed to hug troops and give them flowers. ""A great day, a great day, we love our army.

While directly blaming Hamas for the act, he also declared the Palestinian Authority ultimately responsible. Netanyahu quickly launched ""Operation Brother's Keeper""-- an antiseptic name for a full scale assault on the entire Palestinian population in the occupied territories. Hundreds of Hamas leaders have been arrested and now are being held without charge. Entire communities have been closed off, victims of illegal collective punishment. Checkpoints have intensified. Within some cities, door to door searches are underway. Homes have been destroyed and families dispossessed. Fear is widespread, as is anger.  By any measure, the kidnapping (and I am assuming that is what it was) was a wicked and stupid act. Wicked, because attacking civilians, who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, is never acceptable. In no way, can the action be justified as moral, responsible or an act of resistance.  Nothing can justify Israel's flagrant violations of international law or their demonstrated contempt for human rights. But because the Israeli response was completely predictable, the kidnapping must also be judged to have been stupid and irresponsible. The perpetrators must be condemned for their callous disregard not only for the lives of three youngsters they now hold, but for the suffering they have brought to the Palestinian people.  There is another way in which Netanyahu is to blame for this horror. In a perverse way, he has established the logic which guides the behavior of the kidnappers. The Israelis have long made a practice of exchanging prisoners. With thousands of Palestinians in their prisons, including hundreds being held without charge, the Israelis often treat them as objects for barter. Not too long ago, Netanyahu presented Hamas with over one thousand prisoners in exchange for a captive Israeli soldier. With Palestinian society closely following the weeks' long hunger strike of 100 administrative detainees (those held for prolonged periods without any charges or trial), one supposes that some might have assumed that the way to end the torment of these captives was to create the conditions for another prisoner exchange.   While Netanyahu has declared with certainty that Hamas is responsible for the kidnapping, no evidence for this charge has been offered, and to a Hamas-hating Israeli public, no evidence appears to be needed. But guilty or not, Hamas has behaved badly before and after the kidnapping. Despite agreeing to a reconciliation pact with the PA, they have continued to make irresponsible boastful statements maintaining their right to ""armed resistance."" (I am reminded of a quote from the late great Tawfik Zayyad who once said ""you may have the right, but when you use it as badly as you have, you forfeit that right."") Since the kidnapping, instead of behaving as responsible partners in a unity government, Hamas got cagey. They would not condemn the act and instead, ""a high ranking Hamas official"" told Al-Monitor, ""Hamas truly does not know who stands behind the operation, because there is a separation of duties between the military and political branches of the movement. The politicians instruct the military to find a solution to the prisoner dossier, and the men on the ground have the freedom to choose the time, place and operational details.""  The kidnapping has been a godsend for Netanyahu. He was under increasing international pressure for his continued illegal settlement expansion and his responsibility for the collapse of the peace talks. His rejection of the Palestinian unity government was rebuffed by Europe and the US. And he was on the ropes at home, after new revelations of his questionable spending habits and an embarrassing defeat for his favored candidate in the recent Presidential contest.  With the kidnapping, Netanyahu has been reborn. Playing the victim card and confronting enemies is what he loves most and does best. The kidnappers have given the Prime Minister an undeserved second wind. No longer ""the obstacle to peace,"" he has become ""the defender of his victim people.""  The PA's unity government enterprise has also been impacted by these events. Abu Mazen is clearly not responsible for this state of affairs, but try to tell that to average Israelis. And try to tell Palestinians that Abu Mazen's approach to peace through negotiations is the correct path, when they see new settlements going up, their communities ravaged by an unjust siege, their detainees dying and Netanyahu crowing.  The hunger striking detainees are also victims of the kidnapping. These are not men guilty of any crime-- nor have they ever been charged with any crime. Their plight and their right to be freed from illegal incarceration, once gaining support in Israel and the West, is now forgotten.  With Netanyahu hell-bent on wiping out Hamas, there should be no doubt that this enterprise will backfire just as it has in the past. Extremist groups, born of resentment and reacting to powerlessness, are only fueled by more oppression. This was the lesson Rabin should have learned when he attempted to destroy Hamas in the early 1990's. It was the lesson that Sharon and Olmert should have learned in the last decade. They did not, and neither has Netanyahu.  The lesson to all sides should be clear, but they have never been learned: more violent resistance will not end the occupation, and more violent repression will not end the resistance. Negotiations and non-violent resistance are the only way forward. But right now, in the midst of this unfolding tragedy, no one appears to be listening."

Barra spoke to provide an update on GM's internal investigation into the ignition switch recall at the General Motors Technical Center. (Photo by Bill Pugliano/Getty Images)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb30f322000003000001c25.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"By Marilyn Thompson and Ben KlaymanWASHINGTON/DETROIT, June 20 (Reuters) - A former head of General Motors corporate quality audit warned the company's board in a letter in 2002 that it needed to ""stop the continued shipment of unsafe vehicles"" and ""recall suspect vehicles that were already in customers' hands.""The letter from William McAleer shows that GM's directors and top management were told about serious safety defects in vehicles that were coming off the company's production lines more than 11 years before GM recalled millions of vehicles for faulty ignition switches linked to at least 13 deaths. The contents have not been previously published.GM spokesman Jim Cain said he was unable to address the details of the events 12 years ago, but that the company would take such concerns seriously today.""We are conducting what we believe is the most exhaustive and comprehensive safety review in the history of the company, and that includes looking at vehicles that were built in the late 1990s. And if we find anything that is a safety issue, we will act,"" he said.McAleer, former head of a group responsible for quality checks on cars shipped in North America, said his unit regularly found serious problems in new vehicles and that when he raised his concerns he was told his team should stay out of safety issues.He told the board it should stop shipments of unsafe cars, launch recalls, and revise quality controls to make the company ""independent of corporate politics and cost-cutting concerns.""McAleer said he was transferred out of his quality job in late 1998. Court records show he unsuccessfully sued GM at least four times, primarily seeking whistleblower protection.A copy of the letter was sent to each of the 12 directors at the time - including then CEO Rick Wagoner and then Chairman John Smith.In it, McAleer accused the highest ranking quality executive in North America at the time, Tom LaSorda, of a ""stonewall"" that included trying to stop McAleer from contacting higher management. LaSorda, who was then a GM vice president, later became CEO of Chrysler and then CEO of Fisker Automotive. He is currently a venture capitalist at IncWell. TOOTHPASTELaSorda launched a new safety process, based on a Procter & Gamble program for toothpaste, that was intended to document life-threatening defects, McAleer said in the letter to the board. He described that as an inadequate response that allowed defects to continue and amounted to ""willful ignorance"" of problems by GM.LaSorda declined to comment on the accusations on Friday. In a 1999 letter from LaSorda to McAleer, which was shown by McAleer to Reuters, LaSorda wrote, ""I have taken decisive action with the operating groups and involved senior leadership with a clear process which has been put into place.""GM spokesman Cain said that board minutes from 2002 did not show any indication that the McAleer letter was discussed, and he said that the letter from LaSorda appeared to have responded appropriately. ""The documents we have in front of us suggest we were trying to do the right thing,"" he said.Eight days ago, McAleer sent copies of the 2002 document to members of House and Senate committees now investigating GM and its handling of the ignition switch issue. McAleer provided the documents to Reuters along with copies of postal delivery receipts that he said showed copies of the letter to each director were delivered to GM headquarters.McAleer told Reuters that managers operated in fear of losing their jobs if they raised safety concerns.He also showed Reuters a letter from January 1999, in which he asked LaSorda for a meeting with ""GM Legal"" and LaSorda's boss, saying: ""The current situation represents a clear and present danger to both our customers and our shareholders.""LaSorda responded the next month in his letter but did not address McAleer's request for meetings with other GM executives.Bloomberg Businessweek this week described a suit by McAleer against GM in a story about another employee, a colleague of McAleer named Courtland Kelley, who also unsuccessfully sued the automaker. Kelley is still employed by GM and the company has said it will reexamine his safety concerns.Lawmakers in a hearing this week grilled GM CEO Mary Barra and outside lawyer Anton Valukas, who investigated GM's response to the switch issue. In a report published June 5, he found widespread incompetence and negligence in many GM divisions, but he said that senior GM officials and its board of directors were unaware of the problems.The report said that the Valukas team reviewed all board correspondence dating back to 2003. McAleer's letter to the board is from July 2002. (Editing By Peter Henderson)"
