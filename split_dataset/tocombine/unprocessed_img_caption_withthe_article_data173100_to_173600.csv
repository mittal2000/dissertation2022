I laughed uncomfortably, but as I would learn, such gender distinctions are gestures of respect and safety. (Which I came to appreciate since we were, by coincidence, a group of women.) My two new friends and I, all invited journalists, were greeted by an enthusiastic entourage befitting royalty. We piled into a minivan and zoomed down the dark road to Mumbai. A full moon hovered above the Arabian Sea. Countless stray dogs, awake already, trotted purposefully down the freeway. The second thing I noticed was the driving style; very, shall we say, unique. There seemed to be no speed limit, nor any lanes to speak of. As for red lights, they appeared to mean ""press down on the gas as hard as you can."" Welcome to India. We arrived at the five-star Oberoi Mumbai, overlooking the water, and were greeted with warm smiles, cold drinks and fresh flowers. We quickly checked in and I crashed instantly, excited for what was to come...I've always dreamed of going to India, home to yoga, Bollywood, Ayurveda, Naan bread and the color pink; where goats and chickens stroll leisurely down freeways, old and new collide, 1.2 billion people speak more than 1500 dialects, and inspiration and joy live alongside poverty and chaos. Most people I interacted with seemed deeply happy. They looked me in the eyes when we spoke, their smiles welcoming. ""India will change your life,"" said an Israeli friend who'd spent months on an ashram and was convinced that once I'd discovered India, I'd never come back. The next day over lunch at the hotel's Italian restaurant, we met the women who would join us on our journey: local representatives from Greaves Travel and Oberoi Hotels who, along with Qatar Airways, were our ever congenial hosts. (Silki from Oberoi usually dressed in chic wrap dresses, yet, she told us, she has 1000 saris in her closet!)Mumbai's chaos makes Times Square look like a tea party. During our two days in the city, population 20.5 million and home to Bollywood as well as slums, we got tastes of its main attractions: We visited an Afghan church, Jewish synagogue, and Victoria Terminus, the Gothic train station where Slumdog Millionaire's final scene was filmed and from which 1500 local trains move daily. (Mumbai's massive railway system includes Ladies Only trains for commuters.) We learned about India's religions, and Hindu gods. We checked out Dhobi Ghat, the traditional outdoor laundry system with concrete ""wash pens,"" where linens from the city's hotels and hospitals flutter wildly in the wind like wings. The sun was relentless. When things got too hot or we got too much local attention (my traveling companions were both blonde, a rarity in India) it was back to the van, where we were elegantly sequestered in the lap of luxury, an endless supply of chilled water bottles on hand. In addition to our hosts, in every city we were accompanied by a driver, his assistant and an expert local tour guide. Greaves did a fantastic job planning our journey, and things went so smoothly it was almost shocking. Together, our gracious handlers formed a friendly, informative and highly efficient human barricade that ensured we experienced India's finest: Amazing food, beautiful establishments, bypassing lines when checking in at airports or hotels. Bags carried for us, everything quick and easy without the usual frustrations one associates with India.Yet small shadows of reality crept into our air-conditioned bubble: Outstretched hands banging on our minivan, smells and soot, stares and smog, beggar children grabbing at us, performing contortionist gymnastics alongside traffic. I very much appreciated the extra care, though I must admit, I remembered my backpack days and felt a twinge Colonial guilt -- maybe because the contrast between ""our world"" and ""the real world"" appeared to be so intense. But mostly, I felt incredibly lucky to be part of this first-class journey, especially since unbridled opulence is an important part of India's royal history and culture.After a few days in the rural state of Rajasthan, where we enjoyed Udaipur's scenery and Jaipur's folk culture, we arrived in Delhi, where 22 languages and 1600 local dialects are spoken. We saw a bit of Old Delhi, popping by the16th century Jama Masjid mosque. (Delhi is home to the world's second-largest Muslim population.) The new part of the city was built by the British during the 1920s and attractions like Humayan's Tomb are examples of the Mughal style of architecture, i.e the Taj Mahal. New Delhi also houses the diplomatic enclave, beautiful palm-tree lined avenues lined with consulates of every country you can think of. As our guide explained, in contrast to the wealth and opulence before us, Delhi includes some 500 urbanized villages that are considered part of the city. Many villagers are still dependent on their animals, especially cows (sacred in India) who wander off for a stroll on the freeway or plop down in the middle of the road. ""You'll even see the occasional monkey or elephant,"" she said gleefully. As if on cue, as a couple of wild monkeys sprinted across the street near the President's house. (Classy monkeys, indeed.) Next stop? Champagne brunch at the swanky Oberoi New Delhi, where the city's stylish movers and shakers congregate every Sunday. It was cool to see the social scene of Delhi's upper middle class. And after two weeks of girl time, some mixed company was much appreciated!"

The sports bar holds a special place in a spectator's heart -- it's where you can collectively experience the triumphs, the heartaches, and the last-minute surprises of any game.  Photo Credit: © Jason BarnesClick here to see America's Best Sports BarsThe American sports bar dates as far back as the early 20th century, writes Kevin Roose for ESPN. It began when runners would take the scores of the games from the stadiums and ""run"" them back to patrons. While Prohibition effectively killed the then-sports bar, the advent of television, and televised games, brought the sports bar roaring back.Click here to see the Best College Football BarsBut what's made the American sports bar what it is today goes far past the TV (though it certainly helps to be watching games on a 10-foot projector screen). Today's best sports bars reimagine what the collective sports experience really is. Some fans may want the loud, rowdy, in-your-face game-watching that you can get at bars like Dallas' Frankie's or Atlanta's Stats. Others may want the updated bar food that brings the comfort of home-cooking to the game, like at Philadelphia's Chickie's and Pete's or Brooklyn, N.Y.'s Red Star. Still others may want a more plush experience than the average watch party, for which Emeril Lagasse's Las Vegas outpost, Lagasse's Stadium, fits the bill. And then there are those that may just want to feel surrounded by the sports legends of the past, for which we recommend the ""sports museum"" in Kansas City, Mo., Chappell's.

3,DIVORCE,Handling the Holidays: For Adults Who Grew Up in Divorced Homes,"Tracy E. Clifford, Contributor
Co-author, Love We Can Be Sure Of",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/handling-the-holidays-for_us_5b9c78dee4b03a1dcc7ef7bb,Every year I have to make a decision. Should I spend Christmas morning at dad's and Christmas afternoon at mom's?,2012-11-01,Close-up of roasted turley served with broccoli on background of siblings and woman,https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5b9c78de24000050005335f6.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every year I have to make a decision. Should I spend Christmas morning at dad's and Christmas afternoon at mom's? Thanksgiving day I make it to both my mom's and dad's, sitting down to a dinner at each house and being careful not to get too stuffed so I still have time for my mom's apple pie at the end of the night. If I'm honest with myself, at the end of each holiday, I feel much like I did when I was kid -- split between two houses and trying to make both sides of my family happy. For adults who grew up in divorced homes, the holidays can be an especially challenging time. It can make adults feel like children again -- torn between two parents, not wanting to disappoint or hurt either one's feelings. Although adults who grew up in divorced homes know they are allowed to choose how they spend their time, they may feel a sense of obligation to spend adequate time with all members of their families, which in many cases is impractical or impossible. In the end, if members of a divorced family feel anxious, let down, or upset about how they spend their holidays, nobody wins. Even though my parents divorced close to eighteen years ago, the holidays are a reminder that my family is not the way my heart would have wanted or imagined it. I've come a long way from the eight-year-old girl who felt such deep sadness opening presents on Christmas morning on the eve of her parents' divorce. As an adult, I know I can control my thoughts and actions, and I am not the same person I was when my parents first split up. Thankfully, neither are they.When I start feeling anxious about Thanksgiving and Christmas rolling around, it gives me strange comfort to realize that divorced families haven't cornered the market on dysfunction. There are plenty of people who haven't been touched by divorce, but are dealing with equally, if not harder, realities. Families can be affected by death, disease, addiction, poverty and a number of other problems. Remembering that I am not alone, and that others face challenges far worse than mine, helps change my perspective.Hallmark cards and television commercials tell me that I should feel a sense of warmth, togetherness, and gratitude on the holidays. I'm always happy to have a day off work, and I enjoy the slower pace a holiday provides. But the truth is, the holidays often leave me feeling let me down. I know that countless of others feel the same as I do.It's amazing how even when a divorce is many years behind you, it is an event that never ends. Dealing with divorced parents and stepparents as an adult never really becomes ""easy."" After a while, it just feels like the new normal. When you make a decision to let go of past hurt and resentment, and when you realize your parents should not be in debt to you for any bad decisions they may have made, it can be incredibly freeing. The holidays provide an opportunity to put this mindset into practice.In learning to handle the holidays, I've found the most helpful approach is to manage my expectations. Although my family is no longer intact, I still have a family in a different form. I accept the limitations of my divorced family, and I accept that I cannot ask them to be something they are not. I maintain hope in my life and know that my parents' choices do not need to be my choices, and I can create a new story for my life."
