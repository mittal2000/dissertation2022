Thankfully, this is beginning to change.",2015-04-19,2015-04-16-1429198048-1469785-HUFFPOSTPEACEFULSLEEPsmall.jpg,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-16-1429198048-1469785-HUFFPOSTPEACEFULSLEEPsmall-thumb.jpg,"Did I just give you permission to use a drug?Yes, I did. Sleep is THAT important.Scientists have discovered that sleep is not just important for the brain, but also for immune function, hormone balancing, learning and, my favorite, weight loss. Sleep is the time when your body repairs all the damage done to it during the day. Sleep deprivation can increase your risk of high blood pressure, diabetes, depression, obesity, and cancer. When I used to stay up too late I wasn't as productive. Not to mention, I was more irritable and prone to short tempers that can be very disruptive and embarrassing. Does this sound familiar? I bet it does -- many of us get six hours or less, even though The National Institutes of Health (NIH) says we need seven to eight hours of sleep at night. How many are you getting? Deep down, we all know we don't get enough sleep, yet we make it the last priority on our to-do list, if it even makes the to-do list at all.Why?I live in the city that never sleeps: New York City. Here, sleep is not a valued commodity. It's almost unheard of for people to put in less than a 12-hour workday at the office, and then nearly all of us bring work home.It's considered a badge of honor to dedicate hours upon hours at work only to have no energy left to dedicate your time to what's really important.Thankfully, this is beginning to change.While sitting at a conference last spring, I was surprised to hear Arianna Huffington, someone of her experience and stature, not only allowing herself to indulge in the sleep drug, but encouraging everyone to follow suit!I was thrilled.You see, just like her, it took a big ah-ha moment for me to wake up and realize that not sleeping and pushing myself too hard was not helping me or anyone else. It was actually hurting me. Last year, I developed an abscess cyst on my jawline, about the size of a walnut. Not only was it the ugliest thing you ever saw, my surgeon informed me it was potentially killing me.She wanted to admit me to hospital immediately for observation.I felt a heavy pit land in my stomach.In traditional New Yorker fashion, I said there was no way I could just drop everything to do that. I'm a single mother with lots of responsibilities. She listened for a moment, and then this amazing doctor put her arms around me, held me and gave it to me straight. ""You are one very lucky woman,"" she said. ""I am going to help you take care of this. But you need to stop. You need to slow down. You need to sleep. You need to take care of yourself.""She told me to crawl into bed and only get out of it in order to come and see her. She said that if I followed these valuable instructions I would get well. She explained to me that I work too much and take care of everyone except myself. She made it crystal clear that I needed to stop immediately or I wouldn't be around to take care of anyone else.Immediately, I knew she was right. This was my wakeup call!So, I went home and stayed in bed for weeks, only leaving the comfort of my apartment a handful of times. I slept and slept and slept. Within the first week, I already felt something shift. My internal clock was becoming normal. I started to get tired at night and get up naturally with the sun in the morning.Today, when I feel tired or sick, I cancel everything and crawl into bed until I feel rested, clear-headed, and ready to get back to business. This is a complete 180 from my old self who survived on only four hours of sleep, juggling single motherhood, school and a full-time job.The conference I attended with Arianna Huffington was shortly after my health scare. I found myself nodding in agreement and applauding when Arianna said, ""With sleep and proper rest -- everything is transformed. Sleep deprivation should no longer be a badge of honor."" I wonder if I could have avoided my life-threatening infection if I had not been living a sleep deprived life. I'll never know but now my aim is to get eight hours of sleep at night. Period.So go ahead, try it. Shut off your phone. Fall into bed. Wrap yourself in a blanket. And deeply inhale the freedom of giving your body exactly what it needs... a good night's sleep. Sweet Dreams! xo Lynne"

Under a deal with prosecutors, an attempted kidnapping charge was dropped.The agreement came after several court hearings that sought to determine Spell's competence, with defense attorneys claiming he was unfit to stand trial because of mental deficiencies.Arnold, 43, vanished in January 2012 while on a predawn run in her rural hometown of Sidney, where at the time authorities were noting a sharp increase in population and crime tied to an oil boom spanning northeastern Montana and northwestern North Dakota.Spell later told police he and Lester Waters, a friend from Parachute, had smoked crack cocaine while driving through Sidney to oilfield jobs in Williston, North Dakota, when Arnold jogged by and Waters ordered him to pull her into their car.Spell told investigators Waters ""choked her out"" in the back seat, but prosecutors accused Spell of strangling the teacher.Arnold ""lay dead inside the vehicle and under a blanket"" while the men drove to Williston, where they disposed of her clothing in a dumpster and bought a shovel to bury the body in a shallow grave outside town, a Montana prosecutor said in a sworn statement.Spell apologized for his actions during Friday's sentencing hearing before Judge Richard Simonton in Sidney, a court official said. His defense attorney did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Waters was sentenced by a Montana judge in December to 80 years in prison for his role in Arnold's death, state Department of Corrections records show.

Rand Paul, R-Ky. announces the start of his presidential campaign, Tuesday, April 7, 2015, at the Galt House Hotel in Louisville, Ky. Paul launched his 2016 presidential campaign Tuesday with a combative message against both Washington and his fellow Republicans, declaring that ""we have come to take our country back."" (AP Photo/Carolyn Kaster)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb8f33e25000094003a5cd0.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"This is part of an ongoing series by Credible about how the 2016 presidential candidates would affect student loans and the financing of education for students and borrowers.Last week, Senator Rand Paul demonstrated his concern with college affordability. In response to President Obama’s recent proposal to make community college free, Paul said. “I’ve got a better idea—let’s let college students deduct the cost of their education over their working career!” He wants to allow all tuition and student loan debt to be fully tax deductible, doing away with the current income restrictions and tax credit program. Though this plan would be beneficial to students and their families, critics have pointed out that the wealthy would benefit the most.In the past, Paul has not always voted in student borrowers’ favor. Less than a year ago, he voted against the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act proposed by Senator Warren. In 2013, Paul voted against the Comprehensive Student Loan Protection Act and the Student Loan Affordability Act. He also supported Senator Ted Cruz’s amendment to repeal the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which would have undone significant student loan reforms such as expanding Pell grants and moving federal loans to direct lending. In the same year, he did, however, break this pattern and vote in favor of the bipartisan bill that extended student loan interest rates to prevent them from doubling.His views on all issues, including student loans, are perhaps best exemplified in his annual budget proposals, providing a glimpse of what actions he might take if elected in 2016. In his FY 2012, 2013, and 2014 budgets, he plans to abolish the Department of Education. He makes a specific exception to save the Pell grant program. No provision was made for federal student loans or other financial aid, nor is it clear what would become of these programs.In addition to his budgets, Paul introduced the Cut Federal Spending Act of 2011. This bill would have defunded the Department of Education programs, again with the exception of Pell grants which would have been capped.Paul is certainly not the only politician to advocate for the elimination of the Department of Education—this idea goes back to Reagan—but he has been vocal and insistent on the issue. He has not provided precise details of what would happen to all programs of the Department of Education if abolished, though in a 2014 interview he mentioned, “I would have it [the Dept. of Education’s funding] spent on the state and local level. I wouldn’t take it up there at all, I’d leave it at leave it at home.” Ultimately, it is unclear what would happen to federal student loans if Paul implements this plan.To learn more about what private sector options are available to help graduates with student debt save, visit Credible."

Former friends are now enemies. Meamwhile, the truly egregious boors -- still the mainstay of the big-name ad world -- are running the show, as Peggy and Joan (and eventually Stan?) discover to their differently sized dismay. Meanwhile, Don's forlorn odyssey through his romantic past rings necessary and true. He's chastened. He's sad. He's lonely. So sad, chastened and lonely, that he is willing to bestow all the goodness and compassion he didn't quite bestow on all his previous conquests on a seemingly random waitress he spies in a diner. At first, it appears as if genius show runner Matthew Weiner was up to what Vince Gilliam pulled off towards the end of Breaking Bad around what or who poisoned little Brock. That is, blowing up a secondary moment from a previous season into the signature trope that gives a series its rounded emotional core. However, the semi-spectral waitress Diana (no last name given), whom Don thinks he knows from somewhere, is just a real-life amalgam of competing desires within him. A longing for a wounded, sad brunette vaguely resembling his stepmother Abigail, whom young Dick caught in flagrante delicto with sleazy brothel owner Uncle Mack? Or his own mother, who died in childbirth? A classy, but mournful, true companion along the lines of fellow outsider, Jewish shopping store maven Rachel Menken, whose mother also passed away in childbirth and who herself has since passed away from leukemia? Don goes to the shiva for Rachel, only to be turned away by Rachel's prickly sister (and surrogate mother) because Jewish wannabe Don isn't Jewish or wanted. Then there's the possibility that the new woman in Don's life simply represents a mature sex buddy along the lines of Don's neighbor Sylvia Rosen, whose shown with Don and Di in an elevator with her now drunk and heartless cardiologist husband Arnold. For this new, repentant Don, she's probably all this and more, including, like Don, a refugee from two-car-garage suburbia (and the Midwest to boot). There's something Shakespearean about Don's tour-de-regret, as if he is a ghost passing over the lives of people that he never bothered to deeply know because he was too busy bedding down the latest flame in a compulsive, sex-addicted quest to quell the sadness of his bred-in-bordello childhood. All the women that pass through Don's long goodbye are aspects of his own id; each important in their way, but fully, on their own, not enough. There was never a woman who could be all that Don Draper needed in a mate. And each of his conquests knows this and hates him for it. Even though compared to some of the other more gauche boys in Don's manly orbit -- the formerly likeable, now creepy, Harry Crane is shown crudely hitting on Megan Draper -- what he has done to these women does not merit the treatment he is receiving in return. However, that is the deeper ""No Exit"" point of Mad Men. There are forces at work in life greater than oneself -- whole histories of pain and suffering, as well as inherited beliefs and ideologies -- that predestine one's trajectory. In 2015 America, we just want Don to get sober and into therapy, but, for the true oversoul, pedestrian palliatives will not suffice. At the beginning of episode 9, ""New Business,"" Don is making a milk shake for his sweet son Bobby and second son Eugene. He seems at that moment to feel the greatest pull towards Betty Francis (the former Betty Hofstadt Draper). And rightly so since she was his first wife and the mother of his three children. Moreover, you see in the still child-like Betty that winsome desire to earn Don's approval, and to gain some lebensraum for herself amidst the claustrophobic ennui of her politician-wife milieu. Betty is going to get a Masters in Psychology. ""People love to talk to me,"" she smiles.There is something tragic about both Don and Betty at that moment, which suggests, in the end, they were meant for each other: both in love with the façade, yet capable of bringing out the depths in others, even as they struggle to mine their own. If only they could get out the Kodak carousel ""time machine,"" and travel back to that delightful summer camp episode with Bobby, when they finally seemed happy. Yes, Betty Francis will make a splendid therapist. And, yes, Henry Francis drank the rest of Don's milk shake in the show's best slam yet at the political class: sanctimonious towards Madison Avenue swells, but prostitutes all the same. That whore metaphor from Don's childhood doesn't stop there, especially as Megan's sexy mom, Marie Calvet, demands that Roger Sterling bring over $200 in cash immediately to pay Megan's movers. Then Marie subsequently proceeds to demand that an always-frisky, always-hilarious Roger bed her down. These two pleasure-seeking creatures understand and deserve each other. However, this is Don's story. And everyone else in Mad Men -- despite their own intriguing arcs -- exist as a reflection of what's up with our protagonist. Though he is still able to bring out a complex web of emotions in others, you want to cry for this broken and suddenly honest Draper. The man who had it all is now -- thanks to Megan's vengeful mom -- even without furniture in his groovy Manhattan bachelor pad. This coup de Quebecoise comes on the heels of Don gullibly writing a $1 million check to formerly decent, now empty vessel, Megan, who, even with her ""Zoobie Zoobie Zoo"" charm, has become more interested in her vapid soap acting career -- gifted to her courtesy of Don, and going nowhere since his departure -- than our antihero's true needs. The tragedy of King Draper is that now that he is ""ready"" (as he tells ""Di""), the tough new girl in his life reveals that she is not. She needs to suffer a bit more for her past misdeeds. And so it goes. The heaping mess of karma, born long before Dick Whitman even entered this world, is still inflicting its vengeance on our late-blooming ad man. What will Don do now? Where will he go? What will he become? Millions of similarly cuckolded men, born of Eros and of dust, and struggling with quandaries similar to those of our tragically flawed Achilles, are dying to know. - @CROTTY"

One of them is the free app Charity Miles.,2015-04-18,2015-04-18-1429371314-2396629-EmergencySchoolFeedinginMopti3.JPG,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-18-1429371314-2396629-EmergencySchoolFeedinginMopti3-thumb.JPG,"At this very moment, there are civilians fleeing war in Yemen, Syria, Iraq, South Sudan, Ukraine and Central African Republic. There are more refugees now than any time since World War II.   War means food shortages. Children suffer the most in these conflicts. They feel the pain of hunger and live with the threat of malnutrition, which can stunt them for life. Ertharin Cousin, the director of the UN World Food Programme, says we have to remember these victims of war are not just a statistic. These are human beings. While it can be easy to forget about their plight thousands of miles away, we must not.  In fact, technology has developed unique and even easy ways to help people a world away. One of them is the free app Charity Miles.   If you own a smartphone you can download the app and raise donations for the World Food Programme, the largest hunger relief organization. You do this simply by running, walking or biking. You carry the smartphone with you and the app keeps track of your distance and workout. All you do is select World Food Progamme (WFP) from the list of 28 charities on the app. You then walk, run or bike and every mile you cover donates a meal to WFP. The donations are paid for by corporate sponsors. So it's totally free for you.   The funding is used in the WFP school feeding programs across the world. I made a video about using Charity Miles help WFP feed school children. I actually made the video while doing a Charity Miles run! So just by walking or running a mile you could provide a meal to a hungry child in war-torn Central African Republic. Or you will help feed a child in the Philippines or the Democratic Republic of the Congo. There are so many feeding programs that need funding support. WFP relies entirely on voluntary donations from governments and the public. They are short on funding for many of their missions currently. The WFP school feeding initiative helps improve class attendance and performance. It's an effective way to help children who are missing out on food and education, two things they need to survive and thrive. You can also do the Charity Miles and help local food banks through Feeding America. The Charity Miles app supports about 28 different charities. There is a list where you select the charity you are going to run or walk for. I have run Charity Miles for both WFP and Feeding America. I also have done a number of miles for Stand up to Cancer. And I had been ""retired"" from running prior to starting Charity Miles. So I think anyone can do this. I have raised well over 1000 meals using this app.   Now if every person who had a smartphone could raise 1000 meals, think of how many children would receive food and education.  Every mile you run or walk can help feed a child such as in conflict-torn Mali where WFP has an emergency feeding program. (WFP/Daouda Guirou)It would not only provide food to hungry children, but what a statement it would make as well. If enough people become a ""food ambassador"" that will raise the profile of hunger among social issues. Think what that could mean for advocacy.For example, the Congress will be deciding food aid budgets in the coming months. If the American public makes a statement about fighting hunger through Charity Miles and other means, that will encourage Congress to do their part. It's worked before. The famous Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War II was actually preceded by many public initiatives including the Friendship Train, which collected food for starving war victims in Europe. So if you own a smartphone, download Charity Miles at www.charitymiles.org and you can get started right away. You can donate meals to feed hungry children just by running or walking. You can upload your workout results to Facebook or Twitter. Be a food ambassador."

All Together is hosted by Paul Raushenbush, Executive Editor of HuffPost Religion. and the host of All Together. You can download All Together on iTunes, or Stitcher. In September of 2012, the Rev. Emily Heath wrote a blog for The Huffington Post called: How To Determine If Your Religious Liberty Is Being Threatened in Just 10 Quick Questions. It was just before the Presidential elections and the topic of religious liberty was very hot. She wrote: ""I'm a religious person with a lifelong passion for civil rights, so this is of great interest to me. So much so, that I believe we all need to determine whether our religious liberties are indeed at risk.""The questions offered a pointed distinction with the ""A"" response representing a true religious liberty issue and ""B"" being an example of religious liberty used against another individual or group. For example:1. My religious liberty is at risk because: A) I am not allowed to go to a religious service of my own choosing. B) Others are allowed to go to religious services of their own choosing.And the list goes on. The battle around the American protection of religious liberty continues with recent bills proposed in Indiana and Arkansas, which purported to protect religious liberty, but were clearly targeting the LGBT community. The bills and the public outcry around them have revealed a deep division within religious communities and America at large about the meaning of religious liberty and how it can be protected while respecting the civil rights of other citizens. On this week's All Together, Raushenbush speaks with Jay Michaelson, the author of five books including ""Gay vs God"", ""Evolving Dharma"" and ""Redefining Religious Liberty: The Covert Campaign against Civil Rights""; Michelangelo Signorile, host of The Michelangelo Signorile Show on SiriusXM, and the author of ""It’s Not Over’ Getting Beyond Tolerance, Defeating Homophobia and Winning True Equality""; and Jonathan Merritt who is a columnist with Religion News Service, contributing editor at The Week and The Atlantic and the author of Jesus is Better than You Imagined.

Mohammed al-Shalabi, a Jordanian militant leader linked to al-Qaida, said Friday that the kingdom ""is not immune"" to the chaos befalling neighboring countries, urging the government to implement more balanced economic and social policies to avoid a fate similar to Iraq and Syria. (AP Photo/Raad Adayleh)",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5cc149d4260000350070a7f1.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"Every week, The WorldPost asks an expert to shed light on a topic driving headlines around the world. This week, we spoke with Aaron Zelin about the state of Al Qaeda.Since the rise of the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria, al-Qaeda, the global terrorist network behind the attacks of 9/11 and the U.S. embassy bombing in Nairobi, has experienced fierce competition in the battle for the hearts and minds of radical Islamists. The WorldPost spoke with Aaron Zelin about Al Qaeda's evolution since the rise of the Islamic State group. Zelin is the Richard Borow Fellow at the Washington Institute and Rena and Sami David Fellow at the International Center for the Study of Raidcalisation. He recently published a briefing on the state of the terrorist network. Since its spectacular rise last year, the Islamic State group has made headlines around the world. Al Qaeda has seemingly moved on the background. Is that same dynamic visible in both groups' operational strength? It depends how one frames it, if one is solely looking at Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan, then yes, its operational strength is diminished and has been in decline for years. But if one is looking at the broader Al Qaeda network, which I think is more apt since the number two in the network, Nasir al-Wihayshi, also the leader of AQAP, is based in Yemen and many senior Al Qaeda operatives from the AfPak region and Iran are now in Syria with Jabhat al-Nusra, then Al Qaeda’s operational strength is good. In many ways, the center of gravity for Al Qaeda has shifted from the AfPak region more to Yemen, Syria, and even Libya, where Ansar al-Sharia serves as an Al Qaeda branch even if it is not publicly pronounced. Therefore, while the Islamic State controls territory in Iraq and Syria, while its other ‘wilayat’ (provinces) control spaces in Nigeria, Libya, and Sinai (albeit small in the latter two), Al Qaeda’s network controls territory in Syria, Yemen and Libya. As the situation deteriorates in Yemen, Al Qaeda could be back on par with IS in terms of strength very soon. That said, in terms of Al Qaeda, there is also the question of whether we should be thinking about Jabhat al-Nusra, AQAP, and Ansar al-Shariah in Libya as part of a singular organization at this point, or whether they are now, or are heading toward, being like-minded, but independent groups for most intents and purposes. I’m agnostic about this latter issue. One of the fields in which the Islamic State group has been particularly active is propaganda. Has Al Qaeda’s outreach kept up with IS’ efforts?Al Qaeda’s network has not been as flashy as IS, though Al Qaeda’s network does have a presence both still in the classical forums as well as on Twitter, which has more or less become the headquarters of Sunni jihadi propaganda dissemination in the past two years or so. It appears that AQAP, Jabhat al-Nusra, and Ansar al-Sharia in Libya are attempting to innovate and become more sophisticated in branding and pushing its content. The reality is though, if none of these Al Qaeda network organizations are killing Americans or Westerners or publishing its content in English, the mainstream media won’t follow or act as a megaphone with the propaganda. The vast majority of propaganda put out by the Islamic State is in Arabic and therefore does not get much coverage -- maybe five percent of all their propaganda is reported on. Since Al Qaeda focuses more on its Arab audience too, it gets less attention in the West. It’s not a coincidence you hear so many stories about Nutella and kittens, among other red herrings. Further, the conflict in Syria resonates with individuals in the Muslim world in a way the conflicts in Yemen, Libya, or elsewhere do not. Plus because of the easy access to Syria via Turkey, it allows the capacity for more Westerners to then go off to the conflict. Because the vast majority of Westerners now are in the Islamic State versus Jabhat al-Nusra, the Islamic State gets more mainstream media attention since they can follow the tweets and messages of their own countrymen fighting. This in turn provides a greater megaphone and begins a cycle that feeds off of each other, especially since members of the Islamic State know how to get the attention of Western journalists. It’s not a coincidence you hear so many stories about Nutella and kittens, among other red herrings. Has Al Qaeda changed its tactics since the rise of the Islamic State or are they expected to change their tactics. Al Qaeda has more or less remained resolute in its methodology, even codifying its rules of engagement/guidelines authored in September 2013 by Ayman al-Zawahiri. Al Qaeda is more about patience, biding time, and exploiting the right opportunities. Defensive in a way, but nimble and pragmatic at the same time. Whereas the Islamic State is more an offensive type of organization. IS does not let the feasibility of something get in the way of what it is trying to accomplish. By taking such risks though, it has gotten a lot more rewards. Time will tell which model will have more staying power. Al Qaeda is more about patience, biding time, and exploiting the right opportunities.How much does the difference in leadership style between Al Qaeda’s Zawahiri vs. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi of the Islamic State play a role in the current state and strength of both organization? It is difficult to compare them since their situations are completely different. One, Zawahiri, is hiding from drones in Pakistan and therefore has to keenly worry about personal security on a minute-by-minute basis and as a result is limited, while Baghdadi has the open freedom of the territory he controls. That said, Zawahiri provides strategic advice and directives, which are then used by the leaders of its branches in Yemen, Syria, North Africa, Somalia, and elsewhere to implement tactics and operations based on the local dynamics that those in that particular conflict zone would have a better understanding and appreciation. Additionally, Zawahiri is the fountainhead of a vanguard, where as Baghdadi is a self-styled Caliph, meaning he views himself and is viewed by his followers as the leader of the entire Muslim world as well as a particular government structure being implemented in the areas his so-called Caliphate controls. Therefore, he is attempting a nation-building and state-building project, while Zawahiri is attempting to awaken the masses and conduct terror attacks on the West, while allowing his local branches to facilitate the conditions on the ground for a future Islamic State when he or his successor(s) feel it is ripe.You write in your briefing that ”the Al Qaeda organization now looks more similar to its pre-9/11 iteration.” Could you explain that more in detail? I simply meant that the leadership of the organization is more spread out in many areas of the Islamicate, whereas for years after 9/11, the vast majority of the leadership was based in the AfPak region.More from The WorldPost's Weekly Interview Series: "

The bill would take marijuana off the list of hard drugs in the socially conservative country and make it a soft drug like alcohol. It would allow people over the age of 18 to grow up to six cannabis plants for their own use, or for use by minors if they are patients using the substance as part of a prescribed treatment regimen.

They would also be permitted to grow up to six plants at home without a license.Sales tax proceeds would be earmarked to cover regulation costs, public health and education efforts.Colorado and Washington state led the way in legalizing recreational pot in 2012 by voter initiative, and last year became the first to make marijuana available for retail purchase in state-licensed stores.Smoking, growing and owning small amounts of cannabis became legal in Alaska in February under a measure passed by voters in 2014, but retail pot businesses are not expected to open there before next year.Oregon similarly voted last fall to legalize recreational marijuana, but that measure does not take effect until July.Arizona is one of five states targeted by the Marijuana Policy Project for 2016 ballot measures, along with California, Nevada, Massachusetts and Maine.Beside touting marijuana as a promising new tax revenue source for states, supporters say pot prohibition has achieved little over the years but to penalize otherwise law-abiding citizens, especially minorities.Critics cite anticipated social harms of legalization, from declines in economic productivity to increased traffic and workplace accidents. They also warn of creating an industry intent on attracting underage users and getting more people dependent on the drug. (Editing by Steve Gorman and Ken Wills)"

Most often, what is really being asked is whether White faculty can teach these men. While increased faculty diversity is a key component of success for all students, we do believe that faculty of all backgrounds can effectively teach men of color. That being said, there are four critical elements that must be in place to effectively educate men of color. We offer these recommendations for all faculty interested in improving their success. Challenge ThemWriting in the 1960's, Nevitt Sanford argued that students developed and experienced success when two factors were present: challenge and support. Sanford believed that all students must be challenged academically with rigorous coursework. Lectures, assignments, discussions, and out-of-class work should push students to higher academic horizons. Students should be challenged to think critically, creatively, and to learn how to apply difficult concepts to their everyday lives. Support Them However, challenge cannot and should not occur in isolation. Sanford noted that challenge must be accompanied with support. We like to think about support as relating to direct assistance that students receive from faculty and support personnel. Faculty can hold office hours, make themselves available to students before and after class, and be responsive to phone calls and emails received from students. Colleges can provide support services such as tutoring, advising, counseling, and library services. Of course, students must be aware of available support, perceive available support as being reliable, and know that it can meet their needs.Sanford noted that there is an optimal balance between challenge and support. Too much challenge and too little support can create an environment where students' needs aren't met, resulting in frustration and potential departure. In contrast, when there is little challenge and too much support, students can take learning for granted, become disengaged due to a lack of rigor, and develop a disinterest in their education. As a result, high levels of both challenge and support are necessary for the success of students.Believe in Them While challenge and support are critical for students' academic and personal growth, they are not enough for men of color. Why? Because these concepts were developed with the assumption that certain preconditions were in place that rarely ever are, particularly for our men of color. Prior to challenge, high expectations and belief in students' ability to succeed must be evident. In other words, a faculty member can challenge a student all they want, yet if that student doesn't know that the faculty member believes in them, they'll never rise to meet that challenge. Students must know that faculty members believe in their ability to succeed. Believing in students means having high expectations for them, which should be communicated through both verbal and non-verbal actions. Given the stereotypical perceptions of men of color as unintelligent, high expectations are necessary to disrupt prior messages of inferiority and communicate to students that they are capable of success. With high expectations, students will feel empowered to meet the academic challenges set before them in the classroom.Care about Them Challenge and high expectations must also be met with support. That being said, support may be available and useful, but if faculty and staff do not communicate an authentic care for students, then the support will go unused. Students must believe that faculty members authentically care about them, personally and academically. Without authenticity, students will be weary of using support services and meeting with faculty, especially if they think that these interactions will highlight certain inabilities. Given the apprehension of many men of color to seek out help from faculty and staff, authentic care can reduce their apprehension to engage support by creating a foundation of trust.When faculty members' challenge and support of students are met with high expectations and authentic care, the necessary conditions for student success are fostered. Regardless of background, faculty members who embody these four elements in their relationships and teaching practice with men of color will experience greater levels of success. To be clear, faculty who have success in teaching men of color do not possess some magical superpower, they treat them with care and believe in them. As adeptly stated by Asa Hilliard, to be an effective educator ""the first thing you do is treat them like human beings and the second thing you do is love them"".

We all need to discard the myth that we are superhuman and can handle anything that comes our way, either in our personal or work lives.Perhaps it's time for us to recognize the importance of ""I"" in team work by increasing our own self-awareness. The path to becoming more intentional, more authentic, is not for the faint of heart, but is definitely worth undertaking. (In the author's case, the combination of talk therapy and reading relevant professional books proved very helpful.) Whether embarking upon the journey ourselves or encouraging subordinates and colleagues to get to know themselves better, we will obtain immeasurable payoffs for both individuals and the organization."

Leaders can demonstrate their ability to recognize their own strengths and weaknesses, and encourage team members to do the same. We all need to discard the myth that we are superhuman and can handle anything that comes our way, either in our personal or work lives.Perhaps it's time for us to recognize the importance of ""I"" in team work by increasing our own self-awareness. The path to becoming more intentional, more authentic, is not for the faint of heart, but is definitely worth undertaking. (In the author's case, the combination of talk therapy and reading relevant professional books proved very helpful.) Whether embarking upon the journey ourselves or encouraging subordinates and colleagues to get to know themselves better, we will obtain immeasurable payoffs for both individuals and the organization."

Phillip LondonDr. J. Phillip London undoubtedly made tough decisions during his 23-year tenure as CACI International Inc.'s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) -- and his continuing role as Chairman of the Board. During his tenure and afterwards, Dr. London's commitment to moral/ethical leadership and character development is evident in his work. These experiences are key factors in his latest pursuit, which is personally significant, can impact someone's future (positively or negatively), and is a reflection of an individual's beliefs. Dr. London's latest quest addresses the important topic of character and its relationship with success.Dr. London's character development is the result of being raised by good parents who were upright citizens, good people, hardworking, self-reliant, and had strong spiritual perspectives. His father emphasized during his developmental years the importance of this line from William Ernest Henley's poem Invictus: ""I am the master of my fate; I am the captain of my soul."" This phrase stressed to him the importance of an individual's ownership and control over their destiny. This concept also brought clarity and perspective to the significance of everyone being personally responsible and accountable for their choices -- along with the outcome(s) of their action(s).These strong role models developed his character's foundation, which was further advanced during his time affiliated with the Naval Academy. While at the academy, he learned the importance of time, the idea of mutual respect, commitment, integrity, trust, and being accountable to others to fulfill his duty. Moreover, he believes that an individual's character is a key component of living a purposeful life -- as individuals for the most part want to be proud of the things done and satisfied with the things accomplished.In his latest book Character: The Ultimate Success Factor, Dr. London writes about the subjects of character, ethics, and integrity. This book is the result of his desire to create material about the importance of ""doing the right thing"" for internal use at CACI. However, as he began to write, he realized that there were increasing societal challenges related to character weaknesses and flaws. This realization drove Dr. London to write a comprehensive book about the role of character in the achievement of success, which isn't solely based on material achievements but also the way the success is achieved. For example, did you: give it your best effort; appreciate those who worked in your environment; do your best with the available opportunities? The answers to these questions reflect a personal philosophy or belief system for individuals to develop their moral and ethical character for humanity's benefit.Dr. London was fortunate to have a few outstanding role models who helped to shape his core beliefs and character. Although, he understands that everyone doesn't have good role models. Notwithstanding, deficits of moral leadership in an individual's life don't abdicate their responsibility to ensure that their actions are ethical, legal, moral, and socially responsible. Anyone who doesn't have a positive role model can read about historical figures (e.g., military leaders, spiritual advisors, or civil rights leaders) to develop their moral framework based on individuals who are known for steadfast character. This process can be used as a moral compass to develop themselves by choosing a respected authority who has similar values that can be used for personal development.The good news for anyone who has had ""character missteps"" is that per Dr. London, ""We're all mortal and we all have failures. The important thing is do you subscribe to the notion of character and commit yourself willingly to work on it throughout your life."" Individuals must understand that a mistake at a moment in time isn't always indicative of future behavior. Continuing this topic, Dr. London added, I believe in forgiveness, I believe in the notion of character consideration of expressing remorse, of being apologetic and I believe in all these notions. I believe that people have to be able to get up from falling down and proceed on and correct and enhance their lives.Individuals can turnaround character mishaps, but according to Dr. London, ""turning things around for an individual takes a recognition that you're on the wrong course."" For organizations, there must be a similar realization that turnarounds can begin at any level; although, there needs to be a commitment and desire by organizational leaders to make the necessary change(s).Dr. London recommends that anyone who is in a questionable organization discuss their concerns. By expressing their misgivings, individuals can take a stand to protect their organizations and themselves. Then, if organizational leaders aren't willing to make adjustments (change), then individuals might consider removing themselves from that environment. As stated by Dr. London, there aren't any acceptable times for individuals to compromise on their ethical character by doing something dishonest. As for the importance of choice in character development, Dr. London's advice for individuals who face tough moral or ethical decisions is to ""Believe what you're doing; believe that you're doing the right thing. Belief is a core idea -- the way I see it -- not a mechanical process.""Dr. London also added, ""Success is an internal reward for how you have carried out your life, carried on your business, carried on your life with others. It's more of a personal issue, than it is a material issue; it's not material... it has nothing to do with materiality"". In recent times, he has reported on the apparent increase of a ""win at any cost mentality"". Moreover, he added that previous societal advances weren't based on these types of negative perspectives. Therefore, he's trying to inject his notion of values and doing the right things into societal views.Another important consideration is for individuals to think about the impact of their activities on others -- including unintended consequences. Dr. London wants individuals to recognize that we're in this together and that character sensitivity, appreciation, and respect are necessary for the advancement of our civilization.It's also about driving and developing strong cultures to deliver the very best you can based on high standards, values, integrity, doing the right thing, and trying to do the very best for your clients. At CACI, Dr. London states that there is an ethos and culture to get things resolved as soon as possible, along with an intent and commitment to do things ethically.Dr. London writes in his book, ""Achievement can be defined in terms of wealth, power, or fame. Likewise, it can be defined in terms of social welfare and individual fulfillment."" This definition of success is different than traditional measurements. Notwithstanding, this additional extension of success is useful to help individuals understand that 'winning' doesn't always have a material representation; instead, success can be achieved by the implementation of moral and ethical beliefs. By helping individual's understand alternative measurements of success, this growing trend of 'winning at any cost' can be reversed or stopped.Dr. London emphasized that a positive attitude is an important character attribute. He states, ""The idea of a positive view is a really important one. The sooner you wrap your life with positive perspectives ... the more likely you are to succeed and the happier you'll be. ... It will be a more satisfying experience for people.""The important work that Dr. London does to raise individual, organizational, and societal character attributes is commendable. Nonetheless, this mentality must be taught on an ongoing basis in homes, schools, communities, organizations, and other entities. Ultimately, everyone is responsible for their own character development; although, individual choice(s) can have an impact on humanity's character evolution.While making a choice whether to behave morally or ethically, remember that real and impacting success isn't measured by short-term individual gains. Societal success is a partial result of individual actions, but real and lasting success is driven by the cumulation of positive individual characters and choices.My personal takeaway from Dr. London is that character development is a lifelong pursuit. There must be a willingness to admit to mistakes, take a step back, and make a conscience decision to work toward self-improvement. The key message is that it's not about perfection, but something that's being worked toward. Developed character isn't a state or destination, but it's always a personal choice.No financial or other compensation was received for this article.

Italy, Greece and Malta are bearing the brunt of the rapidly escalating crisis of ""Mediterranean Boat People.""In 2014, a total of 219 thousand refugees were rescued as they attempted to cross the Mediterranean to Europe from Africa and the Middle East. In the eastern Mediterranean the refugees were principally Syrians fleeing the fighting in their homeland. In the central Mediterranean, the refugees included Libyans fleeing their civil war but also a broad assortment of refugees from sub-Saharan Africa departing from Libya as a result of the complete breakdown of Libyan border controls. Syrian Refugee Camp, Za'atri JordanThe central Mediterranean, where the eastern and western basins of this inland sea meet, is the most popular route as the distance between the North African shore and Sicily is only about 300 miles. This is generally a two to three day journey. Moreover, the Italian island of Lampedusa is only 184 miles to the northwest of Tripoli while the island of Malta, the European Union's smallest member, is only 222 miles to the northeast. The distance from Tunis to Trapani, Sicily's closest port, is only 96 miles. Between April 10 and 16, over 10,000 refugees were rescued by Italian naval vessels. The highest weekly number to date. An additional 400 refugees drowned while attempting the crossing. Since the beginning of the year at least 900 refugees have died while escaping from North Africa. The actual number is believed to be much higher. The death toll in the comparable period last year was 17 refugees and 3,500 over the entire year.Much of the activity is being organized by criminal gangs that are charging exorbitant rates, often times exceeding $3,000 per head, and filling boats with little consideration of their capacity or seaworthiness. Refugees are often rescued suffering from extreme dehydration and sunstroke. There are no life jackets.The standing room only shipboard conditions, and the lack of medical or sanitation facilities, means that disease can spread like wildfire even on the relatively short crossing. Typically, the organizers radio a plea for assistance as soon as the boats are 30 or so miles off the Libyan coast.  Maltese Protector Class Patrol Boats, Maritime Squadron, Armed Forces MaltaMalta, 122 square miles in size and whose population numbers only 350,000, has been, proportionally, the hardest hit of the countries bearing the brunt of the Mediterranean refugee crisis. In 2014, Maltese authorities rescued 17,000 refugees, a figure equivalent to roughly 5 percent of its population. That's the equivalent of having 17 million refugees landing on American shores. In October 2013, in response to the sinking of a refugee laden ship off of Lampedusa, which resulted in the deaths of 360 people, the Italian government launched operation Mare Nostrum. The program deployed Italian navy ships in the international waters between Libya and Sicily in order to intercept refugee boats.The operation consisted of a total of 32 Italian naval vessels, averaging five ships on station at any one time. They intercepted a total of 420 boats carrying a total of 150,810 refugees. The operation lasted from October 2013 through November 2014, and cost approximately eight million euros per month. That cost was largely borne by the Italian government. An additional 50,000 refugees were rescued by commercial ships in the Mediterranean.  North African Refugees Being Disembarked From an Italian Coast Guard Vessel in SicilyThe program was criticized by a number of European Community members who argued that Italian willingness to rescue the refugees would only encourage more refugees to attempt the dangerous crossing. In November 2014, Rome announced the launch of Project Triton. This is a more modest program designed to intercept refugee ships when they approached within 30 miles of Sicily.   With summer rapidly approaching and the political situation in Libya spiraling increasingly out of control, there is widespread fear among Italian and Maltese authorities that they will be overwhelmed by a tidal wave of new refugees. Italian authorities estimate that approximately 500,000 refugees will attempt to make a crossing from North Africa this year. With anti-immigration sentiment on the rise within Europe, the EU has been ambivalent about tackling the issue. There is also a mounting concern that jihadist groups in Libya will attempt to infiltrate militants into Malta and Italy, and from there elsewhere into the EU, posing as refugees. Many of the refugees rescued have little in the way of documentation and many refuse to disclose their nationality for fear of being deported back to their home countries. Islamic State has claimed that it has smuggled over 4,000 militants into Europe disguised as refugees. While this number is probably exaggerated, it is likely that some number of jihadist militants posing as refugees have already entered Europe. In addition there is mounting evidence that jihadist groups, especially in eastern Libya, are using refugee smuggling as a lucrative source of funds either by providing protection to the smugglers or by taking over the activity themselves. At roughly one million dollars per boatload of refugees, the ""trade"" in refugee smuggling is worth around 500 million dollars. With little prospect of political stability in Libya, and with continuing unrest in the Sahel region and central Africa, from Mauritania to the Gulf of Guinea, and across Mali, Chad and the Sudan all the way to Somalia, the flood tide of refugees shows little signs of slowing down. Unless the European Community and the United Nations act quickly to bring some order to this situation, what began as a humanitarian crisis will quickly spiral into a catastrophe."

The transmission in his car went, the company he had been working for went under very quickly and he had a semi-serious medical situation needing attention and had no insurance. That familiar voice rang out, ""Mooooommm!!""He is recovering on all fronts very well, I am happy to say but living with one of your grown son's after living by yourself has its moments! My place is small and my habits pretty much set in stone. I am vegetarian, he is a carnivore.I have a few TV shows I am addicted to, he only watches crime shows, crime documentaries, crime reality and well, crime stuff.I am on my computer just about all the time because I write. He isn't a fan of computers except when necessary and the tippity tap tap of my fingers on the keyboard drives him up the wall.On the plus side, we are both very tidy, both night owls and share the same sense of humor. He does his own laundry, picks up after himself and all in all, is a very pleasant person.Remember when your mom, completely exasperated, gave you the side eye and said, ""I hope you have a child just like you when you have children!!!"" Yeah, well, he would be that one.Having been here for a few weeks and noticing my laptop basically attached to me 24/7, he began the interrogation. ""What are you doing on there all the time?"" he queried. ""Writing. I have a FB page and a blog I work on."" Pondering this for a few minutes, he then says, ""Do you make money off of either one or are you just making money for Zuckerberg?"" The tippity tap tap fingers came to a sudden stop. I took off my glasses and just looked at him. Seriously? Do I have to explain myself to my own son now that I am just about to turn 60? I gave him the ""mom stare"" -- you know the one (trust me, muscle memory brings it right back no matter how many years it's been since you have needed it) and said, ""Well, since you are so interested in my writing all of a sudden I will tell you, no, I do not make any money right now but I haven't' been doing it that long."" The inquisition continued. ""Don't most people have ads on their blogs to make money, mom?"" Feeling a bit deflated, I confessed that although I know some do, I really didn't know the ins and outs of it but believed you needed a pretty substantial amount of followers to garner any interest from outside entities wanting to advertise on your blog. Open flood gates. ""Mom, with all the time you spend on that thing, are you telling me you don't make a dime? That is ridiculous. If you put half the amount of time and effort into something you KNOW you could make money at, you would be making a lot of money! What is the matter with you?""Now completely deflated and with no awesome, immediate, mom wisdom retort to launch his direction I did the next best thing. I took my laptop into my room and shut the door. Then I sulked for a bit. Yes, we are both very stubborn, both very outspoken and neither of us mince words. How angry could I get? He was right! The next day all was well with the world and things proceeded as they normally do. However, when he returned from work and found me typing away, I got the dreaded eye roll from him. I lost my temper and we argued. All his points were valid. I was on the computer writing all the time. I love my blog but it is a wee blog right now. I realized that maybe it was really just a journal of sorts. Was I serious about what I was doing or just mucking around? Could I write and submit my work somewhere? How? Where?While I was angry at him at first for daring to question me, his mother, on my commitment to myself and my writing, he had made me face the fact that I had to make a serious decision. To write or not to write. So, I got involved with some amazing people and got serious about my writing.I love this kid for that! No, I'm not a famous author, but I am a lot closer to becoming one than I was two months ago. Why? Because if you don't at least try, don't put yourself out there, you know one thing and one thing only. Nothing is going to happen to fulfill your dream, absolutely nothing. He made me take myself seriously and for writers, this is a tough thing. We have fragile egos, we want everyone to love each and every word we write. We want to make everyone feel something, something that maybe they didn't even know could be stirred within them. We get rejected a lot. It stings. It stings because we take it personally as we write from the heart. Most times, it isn't personal. Most editors will tell you if you ""shouldn't quit your day job"" just yet! I thank my son each and every time I have an editor email me and say, ""We'd like to run this piece on our site, please send your Bio and Links."" For a writer, that makes our pea pickin' lil' heart skip a beat. It doesn't matter if it is a huge blog site or a small publication, it just matters.My son and I have always had a blunt and direct way of speaking to one another. I don't know when this started but I think it is because we are so much alike that we just seem to instinctively know what the other needs to hear and just blurt it out, no cushioning or preamble, just right to the quick. It works. It's a little rough sometimes but it works. It seems that the very things we sometimes wish were different about our children are the very things we end up valuing the most once they are adults. He was the most stubborn child I have ever encountered, to the point I seriously thought his head must be made of concrete to have survived all the head butting he did when he was growing up but it has served him well in his life. He is strong, sure of himself, a natural leader, an extremely logical thinker and a very inspiring motivator.We as parents have to walk the fine line of disciplining them when they are little, trying to correct potential ""stumbling block"" traits all while being careful to not crush their very spirits, that which makes them the unique, albeit ""difficult,"" budding adults they will someday become.We bumped heads many, many, many times from the moment he arrived into this world until just a few hours ago and I have come to realize that's OK, for if it weren't for that concrete head of his and his unwillingness to accept me ""wasting my valuable time and talent"" floundering around on the computer instead of at least trying to set and accomplish some goals, I wouldn't be here telling you about him now.You probably have one of those kids and if not, then a niece or nephew who you see your reflection in. Nurture their spirit always even though at times it may seem impossible to accept as a positive trait. If they won't let go of it and it isn't a violent or obviously unacceptable behavior then it is part of them for a reason. We may not see the reason when we are ready to throw ourselves onto the kitchen floor and scream, ""I GIVE UP!!!"" but it may just be that you see yourself in those stubborn eyes staring back at you! If you do, give them a long, hard, deep stare and ask yourself, do I really want to extinguish that light I see in there?Soon, my son's wings will be fully healed and he will take flight once again. I'm sure in some ways it will be nice to have the place all to myself again, no hamburger in the refrigerator and no boxes to trip over but when I hear the tippity tap tap of my fingers on this keyboard I will always be eternally grateful to my son, especially when I hit that SUBMIT button. Who knows? Maybe one day, Mary McLaurine will be a name you remember? I have to try, right??  Find more of Mary McLaurine at The Heart of Sassy Lassie"

Photo taken by Keith MillerAfter the highly successful productions of Brian Friel's Philadelphia, Here I Come and A Night with Lady G, The Irish Heritage Theater, Philadelphia's only professional company dedicated to preserving and acquainting new audiences with poetry and power of classic Irish theater, are turning their attention to playwright Sean O'Casey.O'Casey, one of Ireland's greatest 20th century playwrights, appeared as a natural choice for the theater to produce three of his greatest works starting thisspring with The Shadow of a Gunman.""In many ways this play is for our time, even though its circumstances are so specific,"" Kevin Rodden, one of the starring actors in the two-act play, said. ""Like any great work, the universal themes persist, and in this case the most poignant moments reflect the ways in which institutions whether the IRA or the British Empire manipulate their members. These characters are all trapped by their society, one that demands you choose a side, as if the argument were black and white, then condemns you no matter what you choose.""First premiering at Dublin's famed Abbey Theater, The Shadow of a Gunman is set during the War of Independence in 1920 Dublin. It begins with one of the main characters, Donal Davoren, a self-styled poet, encourages his neighbors' mistaken belief that he is an important IRA ""volunteer"", an assassin on the run. This ruse, which humorously enflames his neighbors' patriotism and admiration, and wins him the affection of the beautiful and feisty Minnie Powell, eventually leads to catastrophe and untimely death. Rodden, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, stars as Seumas a man of ""contradiction"" that offers an appealing psychology to the actor. ""Seumas' intelligence about everything outside of him keeps him from knowing himself. He's a Nationalist who can't bring himself to fight if it means endangering civilians,"" Rodden said. ""He's a devout Catholic with pagan superstitions. I'm not interested in answers for a character, but rather in questions. What does this person want and how does he go about getting it? Is that productive? What are my points of intersection with Seumas?""Not only does Gunman tell a story that was important to its era; it is also a really interesting exploration of human fatality, added Peggy Mecham co-director of the play. ""The first act is very funny and comedic, while the second act darkens considerably,"" Mecham said. ""I think this is an opportunity to see a play that's near its 100th anniversary that not only reflects its time but also explores human nature with wonderfully diverse characters.""The Irish Heritage Theater will afford local audiences the rare opportunity to experience O'Casey's complete ""Dublin Trilogy"", considered the most impressive and accessible work of the dramatist's career. IHT's production of The Shadow of a Gunman will be followed by Juno and the Paycock, his drama of comic affectations, fleeting hopes and resigned despair in the Dublin tenements (Fall 2015), and finally, celebrating the 100th anniversary of the Easter Uprising, the infamous and highly controversial The Plough and the Stars (Spring 2016).""Philadelphia has such an embarrassment of riches when it comes to theater. What makes Shadow of a Gunman a unique experience is its rare combination of comedy, drama, tragedy, philosophy, politics, and romance,"" Rodden said. ""In 90 minutes, few plays can pack such a punch, and I'm really proud of our production's ability to balance all these moving parts without holding the audiences hand.""The show will run from April 9-25 at The Skybox at The Adrienne, 20th & Sansom Streets in Philadelphia. Performances are Wednesdays through Saturdays at 7pm and Sundays at 2 p.m.. Tickets are $25, general admission; $20 for seniors; and $15 for students."
25,BUSINESS,Anxious About a Work-Related Conflict? You're Likely to Make a Bad Decision!,"Douglas LaBier, ContributorBusiness psychologist, psychotherapist & writer; director, Cen...",https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/anxious-about-a-workrelat_b_7078500.html,"These findings are relevant to everyone in their career roles, but perhaps have greatest significance for those in high-impact decision making positions, whose judgment and decisions affect the organization's success.",2015-04-17,2015-04-16-1429192852-2025005-Screenshot20150416at10.00.23AM.png,https://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-04-16-1429192852-2025005-Screenshot20150416at10.00.23AM-thumb.png,"If you're someone who's prone to anxiety to begin with -- or even if you're not, but faced with a situation at work that looks unclear or uncertain -- you know that it can be hard deciding what to do; which decision will have the best outcome. Now, some interesting new research shows how and why that happens. Most importantly, it reveals why your anxiety is likely to lead you into making bad decisions, which often reflect a misperception of what the reality of your situation truly is. This is very relevant to your role, whether you're a senior leader or in any position in your organization -- whenever you're faced with decisions and choices involving your responsibilities, your team collaboration; or conflicts with superiors or subordinates.This new study from researchers at Berkeley and Oxford focused on how people respond to situations of unpredictability. Those are likely to raise some degree of conflict and turmoil for most people. The researchers found that those who are prone to high anxiety in such situations have a more difficult time than others when attempting to read the environmental cues -- a grasp of the whole situation -- that could help them avoid a bad outcome to a decision they have to make. More broadly, they found that the more anxious people have greater trouble deciding how best to deal with uncertainties in life, in general.  According to the press release, lead author Sonia Bishop said, ""Our results show that anxiety may be linked to difficulty in using information about whether the situations we face daily, including relationship dynamics, are stable or not, and deciding how to react."" This suggests that the more anxious person at work tends to have difficulty making good decisions in his or her personal life, as well, when faced with an ambiguous or uncertain event or situation. ""It's a bit like being Alice in Wonderland, trying to work out if the same rules apply or if everything is different and if so, what choices you should make,"" Bishop added.I've seen many examples of how this plays out in workplace situations, such as when a person's anxiety leads to misperceiving the reason he was excluded from a meeting about a project that he's involved in; and then he acts on that misperception with behavior that creates a problem for the outcome of the project. Or, someone whose boss wants to discuss her long-term career goals. Her anxiety leads to suspicion that this is prelude to being fired or demoted. Then, she speaks about her goals in ways that look as though she's thinking about options outside the company; has one foot out the door already. She later learns that her boss wanted to explore the possibility of her growth within the company.The researchers gave an example from their study in which a friend might suddenly lash out for no discernible reason. It's possible that your friend's behavior might simply reflect a typical variation in their day-to-day mood or interactions. That is, it might be a feature of their personality. Or, it could be a stress reaction that has little to do with you. On the other hand, the friend's lashing out it might also reflect an underlying change in their relationship with you. Although these examples from the research relate to personal interactions, the same situations can arise at work, as well.The researchers point out that if you're prone to high anxiety, your challenge is making the right assessment of the situation, in the context of the relationships, and in view of what else may have happened recently. The researchers explained that you need such a perspective in order to respond appropriately. That is, the highly anxious person is more likely to misperceive and act in a way that has an undesired outcome. The study, published in Nature Neuroscience, also found that highly anxious people tend to catastrophize unclear or uncertain situations, as well. And that can lead to poor judgment and regrettable behavior, as in the example above, in which the person hears a potential change in the workplace as a career threat.As Bishop noted, ""An important skill in everyday decision-making is the ability to judge whether an unexpected bad outcome is a chance event or something likely to re-occur if the action that led to the outcome is repeated."" These findings are relevant to everyone in their career roles, but perhaps have greatest significance for those in high-impact decision making positions, whose judgment and decisions affect the organization's success. Moreover, I think this research adds to the accumulating evidence that our emotions, thought processes and behavior are highly intertwined; and that linkage underscores the value of meditative practice. Increasing numbers of studies find that meditation enhances our capacities to regulate and diminish stress, anxiety and depression. It modifies the brain structures associated with expression of those emotions. So -- whatever your position is in your organization, meditate to diminish your anxiety and go forth with better decision-making resources!Photo credit: CPD Archive  Douglas LaBier, Ph.D., is director of the Center for Progressive Development, and writes its blog, Progressive Impact. dlabier@CenterProgressive.org.
