He smiled but showed no other emotion, said Jason Clark, spokesman for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.In 2011, Balentine was also one hour away from execution when he received a stay. A delay was granted less than 24 hours hours before Balentine was to die in 2009.While three stays of execution for one person is unusual, some Americans say the slow grind of legal justice, sometimes followed by appeals that result in last-minute stays of execution, are cruel both to inmates and the families of their crime victims.""Preparing for death is torture, and I cannot fathom having to go through it three times,"" said Randy Steidl, who served 12 years on death row in Illinois before being exonerated of murder and released in 2004. ""That's inhuman, that is truly torture. That is not justice. If we are truly a civilized society as all of America claims to be, we should not do anything like this.""Efforts to contact Balentine through his lawyer for comment were not successful.The U.S. Supreme Court suspended the death penalty through a 1972 decision then reinstated it in 1976. Since 1976, the number of executions in the United States has gradually declined to 43 in 2011 from a peak of 98 in 1999 because of concern about the possibility of killing an innocent person and the fairness of the system.There have been 27 people put to death so far this year which suggests an end-year figure of around 40, the Death Penalty Information Center (DPIC) said.The increasing scrutiny of each case is resulting in more stays of execution. There have been 37 stays to date this year, which suggests an end-year figure around 55, compared with 41 in all of 2011, the information center said.Fewer executions and more delays also mean longer periods between sentencing and execution. For those executed in 2010, the latest year available, the average time on death row was 14.8 years, the longest for any year since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. The average for all cases since reinstatement was 10.9 years, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics.Gary Alvord in Florida, who according to the Florida Department of Corrections has awaited execution since 1974, is believed to be the nation's longest-serving death row inmate.""This is a national phenomenon of the use of more caution regarding the death penalty,"" said Richard Dieter, executive director of the DPIC, which opposes the death penalty.Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer has several times in recent years expressed concern about long delays in executions. He dissented from a decision in 2011 to allow the execution of Manuel Valle in Florida after 33 years on death row.""I have little doubt about the cruelty of so long a period of incarceration under sentence of death,"" Breyer wrote. HARD ON FAMILIES OF VICTIMSSupporters of the death penalty said the delays and stays of execution are also hard on the families of victims awaiting justice to be done.Texas inmate Balentine was sentenced to death for the 1998 murders of three teen-agers who shared a home with him. The teens were all shot in the head, at close range, as they slept.""My heart goes out to family members who, for the third time, have made the trip to Huntsville, only for at the last minute there to be a stay issued,"" said Randall Sims, the District Attorney in Amarillo who sent Balentine to Death Row.Efforts to contact the families of the victims were unsuccessful.But Mary Jane Peterson of suburban San Antonio, whose son was murdered in 1994, said criminal justice delays take a toll on victim's families.""The murderers end up getting more victims from what happens to the families of the victims,"" she said. ""This affects their health, their emotional status, their ability to work.The Supreme Court halted the Texas execution last week to give it time to rule on arguments that Balentine had inadequate legal representation at his trial. They could eventually clear the way for a fourth attempt to execute him.""I am hopeful that justice will finally, at some point, be done in this case,"" said prosecutor Sims.

The man who really, truly boldly went where no man had gone before -- Neil Armstrong, the first human being ever to leave the confines of Earth and set foot on any extraterrestrial body (that being the moon) was gathered up for one last voyage to the stars and beyond.Interestingly and coincidentally, I was at a dinner with a large group on Friday evening where some of the younger people in attendance brought up the subject of whether man had ever in fact landed on the moon. The various Hollywood sound stage conspiracy theories ricocheted across the room when I felt compelled to inform those born after the 1970s that, like 600 million people in July 1969, I was a witness to history.I was an 11 -ear-old camper at a place called Camp Equinunk in rural Wayne County, Pennsylvania and they had a hotel atop a hill where parents would stay when visiting. This hotel had a big dining room and a large (well, for that time) 25-inch tube-fired TV which was wheeled in and about 100 of us got to watch the moon landing in real time in living black and white. There are nutty revisionists and deniers who feel the whole thing (and subsequent moon landings) were completely contrived, but I know what I saw.As a kid, to me it seemed that America in 1969 was a magical place of infinite possibilities. Aside from the moon landing, what could be more improbable than the expansion New York Mets winning the World Series or the expansion AFL New York Jets winning the Super Bowl? It was a time of Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock on NBC, Larry Hagman as Major Anthony Nelson as the bemused astronaut on I Dream of Jeannie, Dr. Smith mucking things up in Lost in Space and Charlton Heston battling for the dignity of humanity in the first Planet of the Apes movie, which I saw for the first time that summer while lying on a blanket in the social hall of the aforementioned sleep away camp.To paraphrase Tom Wolfe, America to us kids at that time seemed like a ""country in full."" Yes, the Vietnam War was raging but this concerned people seven to 10 years older than me and the other kids playing ball out in the street in front of our houses. We were busy living never-ending ""Pleasant Valley Sundays,"" riding our Schwinn Stingrays to the candy store. Our parents drove Pontiacs and Oldsmobiles in snot green or dark orange with black vinyl tops. A slice of pizza was a quarter and you could get an ice cream pop for ten to 15 cents. We collected 45 RPM ""singles,"" the way people download one song at a time now to their MP3 players and phones. There were but a few television stations, no way to record shows and we tended to live more of our lives in real time than it seems we do today.In the '60s we had JFK urging us to land a man on the moon ""in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win, and the others, too."" It was a time of LBJ prodding America towards civil rights and equality for all its citizens. It was a time of almost unparalleled economic prosperity and opportunity where we as a country dreamed big dreams and actually fulfilled a good many of them.Neil Armstrong was the physical embodiment of the metaphors for Americans in the '60s. He was handsome, heroic, modest and self-effacing. He was a man of few words and great deeds and those few words, ""one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind"" in a sense were the preamble for the age of high technology that the space race ushered in, to a point where we now hold in our hands everyday the kind of gadgets that we used to see imagined on TV and in the movies.Armstrong was the ""all-American boy,"" the paradigm for what so many of us then young boys aspired to be regardless of our backgrounds, ethnicity or science skills.Armstrong represented an America of really big dreams and of infinite possibility. Today, what passes for discourse in this country? Celebrity divorces? Politicians vilifying and dehumanizing one another over the relative merits of the federal budget? For that kid sitting cross-legged on the floor that July evening in 1969 it seemed as though there was nothing America couldn't do. Simon and Garfunkel asked ""where have you gone Joe DiMaggio?"" For us in our time, it might very well be ""where have you gone Neil Armstrong?"" We hope he's looking down on us from that big lunar module in the sky and puts in a good word for America with celestial ""mission control,"" because if our country deserves blessings going forward it's in part due to the kind of people we've produced like Neil Armstrong."

Wolfgang Schaeuble said he told the head of the Eurogroup that he wanted Joerg Asmussen to succeed Stark. He added that he expects Asmussen to join the ECB by the end of the year. Asmussen, a member of the opposition Socialist party, has been a key official in the eurozone's fight against the debt crisis.

""In democracies, it is parliaments and not central banks that should decide on such a comprehensive pooling of risks.""Financing governments has long been a line in the sand for the ECB. Weidmann's predecessor as Bundesbank chief, Axel Weber, quit last year in protest at the ECB's existing, but now dormant, bond-buying scheme - the Securities Markets Programme (SMP).""We should not underestimate the risk that central bank financing can become addictive like a drug,"" Weidmann said.The Bundesbank retains substantial influence within Germany and on financial markets due to its inflation-fighting credentials but, as just one of 17 constituents at the ECB, it is unlikely it could scupper Draghi's plan.Policymakers are posturing over the programme ahead of their Sept. 6 meeting, at which markets will be looking for the central bank to spell out more details of the plan.Central bank sources told Reuters on Friday that the ECB is considering setting yield band targets under the new bond-buying programme to allow it to keep its strategy shielded and avoid speculators trying to cash in.Weidmann said setting such yield band targets was a ""sensitive notion"" but rejected suggestions that he was isolated on the ECB Governing Council in having such reservations.""I hardly believe that I am the only one to get stomach ache over this,"" he said. ECB DISPUTEDer Spiegel also reported that there was a dispute within the ECB over the form of the programme, with officials from countries like Spain and Italy pushing for unlimited ECB intervention in secondary bond markets.ECB officials from northern euro zone countries only want the central bank to intervene in a ""short, but energetic"" way when bond yields ""explode"" upwards, the magazine said.Germany's Finance Ministry is concerned the new ECB plan could endanger the bank's independence, Der Spiegel said.As a condition for ECB support, a country will first have to seek an aid programme from the euro zone's bailout funds. This is subject to approval by finance ministers, and central bankers are worried this makes their action dependent on politicians.To avert this risk, German finance ministry officials were exploring an option where Spain or Italy would make a commitment on economic reforms to the European Commission - an unelected body - as a condition for ECB support, rather than accepting an aid programme from the bailout funds, Der Spiegel said.That option would avert the problem of ECB action being linked to decisions taken by governments, thereby protecting the central bank's independence. However, such a commitment to the Commission would be less binding than the terms of a bailout.Weidmann wanted to ""avoid monetary policy coming under the dominance of fiscal policy.""He did not see an immediate inflation threat from the new bond-buying programme, but added: ""If monetary policy allows itself to become a comprehensive political problem solver, its real goal risks moving further and further into the background.""Weidmann warned against obligating the ECB ""to guarantee keeping member states in the euro zone at any price.""On Greece's position in the bloc, he said it was important that ""no further damage to trust in the framework of the currency union arises, and that the economic policy requirements of the aid programme retain their credibility."""

But mobile industry executives who had been cautiously considering Windows as an alternative to Google's Android say Friday's ruling that Samsung had copied Apple's designs and software features had intensified their interest in a Microsoft alternative.The key reason: fear of patent lawsuits from Apple.The California company's battle with Samsung was in large measure a proxy war against Google Inc's Android software, which is used by many manufacturers to run its mobile devices. The verdict could empower Apple to file more such lawsuits.""Some of the other manufacturers of Android products like ourselves are prepared to face similar lawsuits from Apple,"" a senior executive with a major Chinese mobile maker told Reuters on condition of anonymity as he is not authorized to talk to the media.""The Apple-Samsung lawsuit has given us some reference point on our future innovation. We'll focus on developing our own unique user interface based on the Android platform.""Even though the bulk of our shipments run on Android, the trend is to diversify into other products running on Windows,"" the executive added, predicting that the percentage of Windows-based smartphone shipments would increase significantly, from less than 10 percent now to around a third over the next few years.CONSUMER APPEALWindows 8 and Windows RT - a version of the software made for the ARM Holdings chip designs that are employed in the vast majority of phones and tablets - ship in October.Some analysts are skeptical that Microsoft can produce a device that the mobile consumer will love.""Microsoft has been the beneficiary of this whole fight as the other non-Android option,"" said Ron Laurie, a Silicon Valley-based specialist in IP and investment banking and co-founder of Inflexion Point Strategy. ""But safety (from lawsuits) by itself is not enough. You have to appeal to consumers.""And so far the market has seen that consumers want phones and tablets that look like Apple's devices, he added.Hardware manufacturers, mostly based in East Asia and known in tech industry jargon as original equipment manufacturers or OEMs, are weighing their options.""From an OEM perspective, the verdict alone, and certainly an injunction on sales of any kind, levels the playing field between Android and Windows Phone,"" said IDC analyst Al Hilwa. ""At this point, the two platforms would have to fight on features and developer ecosystems to win.""Wall Street thinks Microsoft still stands a chance of reclaiming its former glory, with investors citing a promising pipeline for 2013. But they will want hard reasons to pay more than $30 for a stock that hasn't traded above that for any extended period of time since 2000.The verdict in Apple-Samsung was closely watched at Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington.""Windows Phone is looking gooooood right now,"" tweeted a clearly enthusiastic Bill Cox, senior marketing communications director for the firm's phone division, soon after Friday's verdict.HOMEGROWN OPERATING SYSTEMSAsian manufacturers now need to invest in further customization of the Android platform, much as Amazon.com Inc has done with its Kindle Fire device, industry officials say.ZTE and Huawei, China's two largest handset makers, declined comment. Both have announced plans to launch Windows-based phones to supplement their Android products.""Smaller Android phone makers like (Taiwan's) HTC, (Google's) Motorola and Sony will have challenging times ahead,"" said Seo Won-Seok,"" a Seoul-based analyst at Korea Investment & Securities. ""They'll face increasing production costs and rising entry barrier to the Android ecosystem. They now face a great risk of similar litigation from Apple.""Manufacturers may also look at other mobile operating systems beyond Windows, analysts said. Samsung, for example, also has phones that use proprietary software called Bada.Chinese manufacturers also have the option of homegrown operating systems such as those developed by Baidu and Alibaba, but Jane Wang, a Beijing-based analyst from Ovum, doubted they would be adopted in a big way because the ecosystem of applications and services around them remains limited.""Chinese handset makers are a practical bunch in that they will weigh the costs and benefits when coming up with products running on a different operating system,"" said Wang, ""It may not be worth their while.""Some manufacturers are particularly exposed. The smartphone portfolio of Korea's LG Electronics Inc, for example, is entirely composed of Android devices, leaving it vulnerable should Apple take legal action against it.And HTC, once the Android market leader, has also struggled in lawsuits with Apple and lacks its own strong patent portfolio, making it vulnerable to further legal challenges. It has tried to rebuild market share with new models, the One series, that incorporate high-level photography functions and audio technology from U.S. firm Beats, in which it bought a stake.""For all these manufacturers it's a risk management game,"" said Andrew Milroy, Singapore-based vice president of Frost and Sullivan, a consulting company.

Ahead of the pack was ""Expendables 2,"" now in its third week. The Stallone and friends project brought in $13 million.

The total take for movie this weekend is about $200,000 less than Deadline's projection, which means the film is just ahead of ""Obama 2016,"" per Box Office Mojo. The two films are separated by less than $70,000. The Obama documentary is based on Dinesh D'Souza's controversial book, ""The Roots of Obama's Rage."" D'Souza, who co-directed with John Sullivan and narrates most of the film, traveled to Africa to meet with Obama's half-brother. In a previously released clip, D'Souza peppers George Obama with questions in an attempt to get Obama to say the president should be taking care of his brother.

Wallace, the dogged, merciless reporter and interviewer who took on politicians, celebrities and other public figures in a 60-year career highlighted by the on-air confrontations that helped make ""60 Minutes"" the most successful primetime television news program ever, has died. He was 93. (AP Photo, File) NO SALES",https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5bb231af2200004301db7f45.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale,"One year before his death in 1990, Leonard Bernstein conducted the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra and Chorus in a wildly romanticized rendition of Mozart's Requiem. The recording immediately drew controversy: some critics lambasted it for being too personal and having too many tempi inconsistencies, while others listened in awe of Bernstein's highly personal and emotionally charged conducting. The Lacrimosa dies illa is especially spellbinding. Bernstein -- silver-haired, bronzed, and sweating profusely -- conducts in such a slow tempo that the music threatens to fall apart, pushing the musicians to the brink of exhaustion and summoning tear-like phrases from the strings' mournful accompaniment. The standard recording length of Mozart's Lacrimosa is just over three minutes. Bernstein's 1989 version ebbs and flows for over five and a half minutes. Mozart's Requiem becomes Bernstein's requiem: a final musical gesture.By the end of his life, Leonard Bernstein achieved heroic status. He was lauded as the greatest American-born conductor and had come to embody the New World by championing America's most eminent composers and re-interpreting Europe's revered musical deities. He thrilled audiences with his musical theater works On the Town and West Side Story and had come to dominate not only the New York Philharmonic but also the Vienna Philharmonic, amongst Europe's most esteemed orchestras. Above all, Bernstein was a tireless advocate for artistic expression. He voiced the need to promote music that communicated with anyone -- not just the musical cognoscenti -- and decried the mid-20th century rise of academic twelve-tone and serial music, a compositional language he felt excluded listeners from the all-embracing tonality of Beethoven, Brahms, and Mahler. In his 1973 Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard entitled The Unanswered Question, Bernstein brilliantly elucidated his ideas about music and metaphor, music and morality, language, and politics. But Bernstein's aspirations lay beyond being America's greatest maestro; he had every intention of composing his ""one important piece"", a great American masterpiece, and being the conductor to premiere it. I think Bernstein possibly desired to be America's Mahler. Many critics, such as the famed cellist Mstislav Rostropovich and Leon Botstein, the President of Bard College and principal conductor of the American Symphony Orchestra, argue that Bernstein's compositional talents were simply not on par with his abilities as an interpretive musician. Botstein wrote an especially biting criticism in 1983: ""Bernstein's serious music, at its best, is reminiscent of an exuberant adolescent who... uses impressive mannerisms, clichés, and gestures to pour out his heart."" On the other hand, Barry Seldes, author of Leonard Bernstein: The Political Life of an American Musician, thinks Bernstein's inability to compose his ""one important piece"" was inextricably tied to the composer's socially progressive outlook, forged during his youth in the milieu of FDR's New Deal politics. In the 1950's during the Red Scare, Bernstein was a politically outspoken liberal who was incessantly harassed by the FBI, blacklisted by the State Department and CBS, and, at one point, had his passport revoked. Although he escaped the 1950's relatively unscathed -- unlike many left-leaning artists of the day, the conductor was never called to testify for the House Un-American Activities Committee -- Bernstein was berated throughout the 1960's for being, as Tom Wolfe once put it, ""radical chic"" and whimsically lending his celebrity to support the ""nice liberal cause"" of the month. After the assassination of JFK, Bernstein was depressed about the state of America and about a loss of liberal faith. An American audience receptive to the kind of work he wanted to compose, a piece that would resonate with such loss, simply did not transpire.Political machinations and accusations of a lack of creative talent aside, I think Bernstein's lucrative and absorbing career as a conductor may have obstructed his serious compositional pursuits. Bernstein was his own worst enemy. Instead of honing his compositional craft and working privately and intensely on sustained composition, he was much more concerned with the state of music at large and used his powerful and persuasive talents of discourse and musical interpretation to help sustain a fragile artistic industry. Bernstein sacrificed his private time as a composer, and possibly his dream to compose an American masterwork, in order to build a legacy of accessibility, education, and public understanding of the arts. His affable narration of Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf continues to thrill young audiences and inspire future musicians -- not to mention soothing my one-year old niece during her most agitated crying fits. His recordings of the Mahler, Beethoven, and Brahms symphonies astound contemporary listeners; his recording of Mahler's Fifth Symphony has nearly half a million hits on YouTube. His Young People's Concerts, a concert and lecture series created during his tenure with the New York Philharmonic, was nationally televised by CBS in prime time in the 1960's, syndicated to forty countries, and, judging by user reviews on Amazon, still proves to be an enlightening educational tool. Though he may not have realized it, Bernstein lived in a new era. Music of the 19th century belonged to the creative genius, but music of his century, the 20th century, belonged to the interpretive genius. Celebrating his birthday on August 25th in the 21st century, I find Bernstein's legacy as an educator and conductor more vital than ever in a time when the arts face a threat greater than a lack of public funding: a lack of public interest."

Copyright © 2012 Dana Adam Shapiro. Excerpted with permission by Scribner, a Division of Simon & Schuster, Inc.NAME (or alias): Ruby  OCCUPATION: Real Estate YEAR OF BIRTH: 1976 CURRENT MARRIAGE STATUS: Divorced DO YOU HAVE ANY CHILDREN? Nope TOWN WHERE YOU GREW UP: Alabama TOWN WHERE YOU LIVE: New York YEAR OF MARRIAGE: 1999 HOW LONG YOU DATED BEFORE YOU WERE MARRIED: Four years YEAR OF DIVORCE: 2009Seth and I met when I was nineteen and he was twenty. I believe it was in a German theology class. Nothing turns me on like a man with a really thick brain, and I thought he was one of the smartest people I'd ever met. We didn't get together in college, but we were friendly. After college, he was at Columbia for grad school and I was at NYU and we started hanging out. I remember having Chinese food on his roof one night and it just suddenly felt magical. It was like walking into a movie and here was my ""happily ever after."" It was overwhelming. Of course, hindsight's 20/20 so now I can see all the issues that we had. I'm trying to think of a non-judgmental way to say this... I'm not a person with a lot of boundaries -- I'm very interested in emotional intimacy and messiness. I like close quarters in that regard. So while at first Seth found that charming, I think ultimately he started to find it overwhelming. He is somebody with a lot of boundaries. He just really likes to be by himself. He has, like, two close friends. I mean, this is a stupid example, but on Facebook, I had like 800 friends and he had 23. On Flickr, he's the guy who has photographs of his cat and his new bed. That's what he's sharing with the world. So during our marriage, when we were invited places or over for dinner parties, I would always go by myself. I just figured, ""Okay, different strokes for different folks. It's not his thing, I'm not going to force him."" I had made the mistake of trying to make him go to things when he didn't want to and that didn't make anybody happy. He was miserable the whole time and then I couldn't enjoy myself because I was so focused on how unhappy and hostile he was to everybody. I do think Seth loved me so much and for so long that he really did try to change who he was -- to go from somebody who was essentially introverted and isolated to somebody who was extroverted and engaged. But when it came down to having kids, he just couldn't push past that boundary.When we turned 30 -- or when I turned 30 -- I started to get really obsessive about the kid thing. It was like, ""Okay, maybe not now, but when in the next two years are we going to try to get pregnant?"" To his credit, he was very clear about all this. He kept saying, ""I really don't know if I want to have kids."" And I was like, ""Of course you want to have kids! Who doesn't want to have kids?"" I really just refused to hear him. And I guess that's what ultimately broke us up. I think there's this popular misconception about sex in a marriage: that you get bored, or that it's the same type of thing over and over again. And that can set in, sure. But when things were good between us, the fact that we were married actually made things more intense. Because you're so completely at ease with the other person, you know you're so loved by them, and that can be amazing. But sex is the ultimate form of communication and when that communication breaks down it becomes very hard to want the other person in any serious way. And because I wanted a child so badly, sex became loaded in that regard. The first year we were together, Seth and I must've had sex five or six times a week. By the last year of our marriage, we maybe had sex five or six times that year.I suppose in some weird, judgmental way, I always thought that affairs were symptoms of moral character. And now I see them for what they are. It is a crying out of feeling totally alone within your own marriage -- sexual isolation or emotional isolation -- which is the scariest feeling because there's no recourse. When you're single, there's a possibility that you're going to fall in love. You might be lonely, but you dwell in that type of possibility. When you're married and things are shitty there's nowhere to go. So you really start to resent the person. And there were moments when things got really bad between Seth and me. I remember being in bed and him touching me and me thinking: ""You've gotta be fucking kidding me. All you do is make me feel like shit and then you want to get laid? What are you crazy?""So we got into our own little vicious cycle. The more I needed him, the more withdrawn he became, and the more susceptible I became to the attention of other men. I had what I call a number of ""emotional affairs."" At one point I was pretty convinced that I was in love with one of these guys. I had gone to a conference and this person had been there and I ended up sleeping with him in the same bed, spooning, lying in his arms all night. I had written all about it in my journal and left it out. I mean, it's so obvious I wanted to get caught. And of course Seth ended up reading it, which led to a complete blowout. I have a very clear image of him coming into my room, looking at me with this absolute shock on his face and it cutting me in my gut. I felt like I'd gotten kicked and that I deserved it. I don't mean that I deserved to be kicked -- I mean that I deserved to be kicked multiple times. But of course my response was: ""Why did you read that?!"" My stepmom had all these great lines about marriage that I thought were completely ludicrous when I first heard them, but the longer I was married, I felt they were really right-on. One was: ""You can be right or you can be married."" Or: ""Marriage isn't a 50/50 compromise -- it's a hundred percent compromise. Neither person totally gets what they want."" I'm sorry if that sounds cynical but people who think that love conquers all, I just wonder if they've ever been married. Ninety percent of the secret to being married is the commitment to the process of being married. Whatever comes your way -- problems with sex, problems with money, whatever -- it's essential that you're both committed to working out a solution where both people are represented, where the well-being of the other person is just as -- if not more important -- than your own. It's an easy thing to say ideologically, but it's really, really hard to do, especially the younger you are.The question is: Do you come to a point where you compromise yourself into oblivion, where you just cease to exist? I think that is the real danger about staying in a bad relationship. And I remember definitely thinking that. Like if I had just given up on the child thing and it was okay to go everywhere by myself and essentially be isolated within my own marriage, I'd probably still be married. If I had tried a little harder, if I had done a little better, if I had not been so demanding, if I had been more understanding, maybe it could have worked. I think part of me is still haunted by that idea. And there are people who do make those choices. But I just think I would've woken up at 40, homicidal and ready to kill him. We would've been one of those couples who were married for fifty years and hated the sight of each other. And that is really easy to let happen -- incredibly easy.   Emotionally, it's just devastating to suddenly be single, especially if you've been married your whole adult life. It's shocking. It's like this seismic shift that people don't warn you about. In popular culture, it's depicted as this great liberation, but it sure as hell doesn't feel that way. When you're married, your frame of reference for a relationship is, you know, let's go to Target, we'll run some errands, clean up the garage, then maybe in the afternoon we'll take a nap and have sex, and then we're seeing the So-and-so's for dinner. You know that there's no hiding your complexity from the other person or the other person hiding their complexity from you. Eventually all your shit comes out and it comes out in full force, so you might as well stop pretending sooner rather than later.When you're dating, it feels like you're involved in this elaborate public relations event where, as Chris Rock says, the ambassador of you is meeting the ambassador of them, and suddenly you're getting dressed up and receiving a beautiful bouquet of flowers, getting taken out for a three hundred dollar dinner and having a bottle of wine on a Thursday night. And you're just like, ""What the hell is this?"" You feel like Alice in Wonderland. It's not that it's not fun; it's just not real. It's substance-less. Personally, I prefer Target.You Can Be Right (Or You Can Be Married): Looking for Love in the Age of Divorce hits shelves September 4. "
